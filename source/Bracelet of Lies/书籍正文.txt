###chapter 1 Last Night Wasn't a Dream
********
After a drunken night in her CEOâ€™s tent, Isabella flees leaving her bracelet behind. When a rival claims the encounter, she must choose: reveal the truth and lose her job, or watch him fall for an impostor. Passion and deception collide.
********

"Ah..."

In the dead of the night, a moan echoed through the tent.

Isabella Miller was burning up, her hands clutching the collar of the man in front of her, the bracelet on her wrist making a crisp clinking sound.

The man's muscular arms held her tightly, his breaths coming in scorching gasps.

Amidst the man's repeated fervent thrusts, Isabella shuddered to a climax.

Yet it seemed the man had endless stamina. He quickly caressed her back and entered her with force once again.

...

Time passed, and at last, the affair ended. Isabella curled up in the man's warm embrace and fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning, Isabella turned over. Her fingers touched something warm.

The unfamiliar sensation jolted her. She slowly opened her eyes to see a handsome face before her.

"Boss?" Isabella's mind went blank for two seconds, and then wild fragments of last night came rushing back. She suddenly widened her eyes and sat up abruptly, only to feel sore all over.

But what took her breath away was the scene before her.

In a spacious tent, the blankets were in disarray, and Sebastian Landon lay naked, with only a thin blanket draped over his waist. His long legs were crossed, and faint, delicate scratch marks could be seen on his back.

Isabella felt as if she had been struck by lightning. She sat there as the world seemed to collapse.

She, an intern who had only joined the company for half a month... had slept with the boss?!

At that moment, Sebastian's hand moved slightly as if he was waking up.

Isabella panicked, hurriedly dressed, and fled the scene without noticing the bracelet she had left behind on the pillow.

Outside, it was not yet dawn, and Isabella quickly made her way across the grass barefoot and dove into a pink and white tent.

As she lay down, Vanessa Field, who shared the tent with her, turned over and met Isabella's eyes.

Isabella's breath stopped in fright.

Vanessa just glanced at her and closed her eyes, casually asking, "What are you doing up so early?"

"I..." Isabella was nervous and thought fast. "I just went to the restroom."

Vanessa didn't ask any more questions. Soon, the tent was filled with the sound of deep breathing.

Isabella quietly sighed in relief, her heart still pounding violently.

Hours passed.

Laughter and cheerful voices came from outside.

Vanessa unzipped the tent and poked her head out to Isabella. "Isabella, get up. We've had breakfast, and we're going hiking soon."

The company had organized a team-building camping trip, and they were spending three to five days in the scenic area.

Last night, everyone had quite a bit to drink at dinner.

Isabella hadn't wanted to drink, but since she was new to the company and wanted to make friends with her colleagues, she ended up drinking a few extra glasses.

Little did she know that because of that, she would accidentally enter the wrong tent and, even more inadvertently, sleep with her boss, Sebastian!

The thought alone made Isabella's head start to hurt again.

"Isabella? Isabella?" Vanessa called out several times, but there was no response, so she took off her shoes and crawled into the tent. "What's wrong with you, Isabella?"

Isabella sniffled. She felt like crying, and her voice was low as she said, "I'm fine."

Vanessa reached out and touched her forehead. "Oh no, you have a fever?"

"I'm fine." Isabella bit her lip, held back the urge to cry, and said in a muffled voice, "I'll be okay if I lie down for a while. You guys go hiking. You don't have to worry about me."

Vanessa, still concerned, got two fever pills and made Isabella take them before leaving with the others to go hiking.

Isabella started to sob from discomfort only when the noises outside had died down.

Her body felt terrible. The traces of last night's pleasures still lingered, and perhaps because she was sensitive, she felt she could smell Sebastian with every breath. Coupled with the fever, Isabella felt miserable.

Meanwhile, the hiking team had gathered at the foot of the mountain.

When Sebastian stepped out of the car, the girls' gazes were instantly drawn to him.

"Ah, Mr. Landon is so handsome!"

"I'm used to seeing Mr. Landon in suits, but I never thought he'd be so handsome in casual clothes!"

"Girl, you're practically drooling."

"Hahaha, I've seen everything today."

Sebastian stood there with an extraordinary demeanor. His eyes scanned the crowd from behind his sunglasses. He asked in a deep voice, "Did everyone sleep well last night?"

Everyone answered in unison, "We did."

Sebastian frowned, tilting his head slightly, his gaze shifting to his assistant Jack Brown.

Jack got the hint and spoke seriously. "Did anyone enter Mr. Landon's tent last night?"

The crowd exchanged glances, all shaking their heads.

Everyone worked for Mr. Landon, and even though a few people in the assistant team liked the boss, they wouldn't dare risk their careers. Who would be so bold as to enter the boss's tent?

Sebastian's brow furrowed even tighter when he saw no one confess. He raised a hand, a bracelet dangling from his finger, "Whose is this?"

Again, the crowd shook their heads, indicating they had never seen the item.

"If anyone knows whose bracelet this is, please let me know," Sebastian said gravely, adding, "There'll be a reward."

"Additionally..." He paused, then added, "I'll double your year-end bonuses."

The crowd erupted at his words.

"He'll double it?"

"My year-end bonus was twenty thousand dollars last year. If he doubles it, that'll be forty thousand dollars. Amazing. "

"Whose bracelet is that, anyway?"

"It looks like an ordinary bracelet. Is it really that valuable?"

"Vanessa, do you know?"

"Huh?" Vanessa snapped back to reality, her expression subtly changing. "I don't know..."

"Alright, let's start the roll call now." Jack began calling names.

When he called Isabella's name, there was silence.

"Where is Isabella?" Jack asked.

Vanessa stepped forward. "Isabella is sick. She's in the tent."

"Sick?" Jack was uncertain and looked toward Sebastian.

Sebastian sat in the black car, playing with the bracelet in his hand, contemplating.

Jack didn't dare disturb him. After finishing the roll call, he said, "Let's set off then."

Closing the notebook, Jack walked to the side of the car. "Mr. Landon, are you going with everyone?"

Sebastian looked listless and seemed uninterested. He kept staring at the bracelet in his hand, and after a moment he said, "I'm not going go. You lead the team."

"Alright, Mr. Landon."

"What are you looking at, Vanessa?" Laura Jones tugged at Vanessa. "Hurry up. The first ten to reach the end get a bonus."

"Okay." Vanessa nodded but looked back once more.

The black car sped back to the campsite on the verdant winding mountain road.

Suddenly, Vanessa turned to Jack and said, "I'm worried about Isabella, Jack. I won't join you. I'm going back to take care of her."

"Alright."
###chapter 2 Why Are You Trembling?
Isabella had slept for a while and felt extremely thirsty. She dragged her heavy body out of the tent and suddenly noticed a pair of men's athletic shoes in front of her. She looked up and saw a pair of tall legs. 

When the sunlight broke through the mist, Isabella could see Sebastian's face clearly. She almost fainted on the spot. 

"Mr. Landon?"

Wasn't he supposed to be mountain climbing?

Sebastian squatted in front of her and looked at her feverish, red face with a serious expression. "I have a question to ask you."

Isabella felt nervous and licked her dry lips. Her heart was beating fast. "You... you may ask."

"Did you see anyone entering my tent last night?" Sebastian asked, staring into Isabella's eyes. His overwhelming presence made Isabella's heartbeat accelerate. 

Isabella's gaze shifted, and her eyelashes trembled. "N...no, I didn't see anyone."

"Why are you trembling?" Sebastian noticed her behaving strangely.

Her voice was trembling, and her body was also shaking violently.

Isabella was thin, and Sebastian was somewhat worried about her. 

He had dozens of assistants in his office, each responsible for different areas. Isabella was a new intern. Sebastian remembered her because she was particularly timid. During her first interview, Isabella was so nervous that she couldn't even make eye contact with him and kept her head down the entire time.

"I...I'm cold," Isabella trembled even harder.

"Cold?" Sebastian frowned. "But aren't you running a fever? How could you be cold?"

As he spoke, he reached out and placed his icy fingers on Isabella's forehead. Quickly, he furrowed his brows. "What's going on? Your forehead is so hot."

"Mr. Landon, I'm fine..." Isabella trembled uncontrollably and felt extremely ill. She wanted to stand up, but she had no strength left in her and could only curl up weakly on the grass, feeling her consciousness slipping away.

"Isabella?" Sebastian felt that something was wrong and tried to wake her up.

At first, Isabella could respond drowsily, but then she completely lost consciousness.

Sebastian bent down and lifted Isabella up from the ground without hesitation. She looked very thin. He felt how light she was as he held her. Sebastian lowered his head to look at her and casually caught a glimpse of the hickeys on her neck. He squinted.

"Mr. Landon!" a voice broke the silence of the forest.

Vanessa had run back. Her hair was disheveled, and she was gasping for breath.

Sebastian said, "Why did you come back?"

Vanessa glanced at Isabella, who he was holding in his arms, and took a deep breath before saying, "I was worried about Isabella and want to come back to take care of her. What happened to her?"

"Her fever got really bad, and she passed out," Sebastian said as he put Isabella in the back seat of the car. "I need to take her to the hospital."

As he was about to get in the car, Vanessa urgently reached out and grabbed the door, pleading, "Mr. Landon... Can I come with you?"

Sebastian looked at her, scrutinizing her with his gaze.

Vanessa explained, "Isabella and I are colleagues, and we're both women. Let me come with you. I might be able to help."

Sebastian thought she made sense, so he agreed.

---

At the hospital, they filled out the admission procedures for Isabella and started her on a drip.

Vanessa went to get some water. When she came back, she saw Sebastian standing at the foot of the bed, his gaze fixed on the sleeping Isabella, lost in thought.

" Please have some water, Mr. Landon." Vanessa poured a cup of water for him.

"Thank you," Sebastian took the cup of water and casually placed it aside. "What's your name?"

Vanessa was taken aback, but then she realized that he had dozens of assistants and Jack was the only one who was usually by his side. Of course, Sebastian wouldn't know her.

"Vanessa. I'm Vanessa Field..."

"There's something I need you to confirm for me, Vanessa."

Vanessa's eyes showed a hint of disappointment, but she still maintained her smile. "Please go on."

Sebastian gave her some instructions and then left the ward.

Vanessa bit her lip and walked to the bedside, looking at the still unconscious Isabella. She had a complicated mix of emotions in her eyes. Thinking about Sebastian's instructions, she pursed her lips and slowly unbuttoned Isabella's shirt.

She slowly undid each button...

When all the buttons were undone, Vanessa saw the marks on Isabella's body and immediately covered her mouth in shock.

---

"Where did you go, Mr. Landon?" After Jack and his colleagues returned to the campsite, they realized Sebastian was missing and quickly called him to ask where he was.

"Isabella passed out, so I brought her to the hospital," Sebastian replied.

"Isabella, the intern?" Jack was slightly surprised, not because Sebastian had personally brought Isabella to the hospital, but because he was amazed that Sebastian could remember an intern's name.
Sebastian had dozens of assistants, but he didn't remember anyone except for Jack.

However, he remembered Isabella's name. It was quite extraordinary.

"Yes." Sebastian raised his wrist and glanced at his watch. He said, "Have fun, everyone. I'll give out the bonuses after the camping trip."

After giving a few simple instructions, he hung up the phone.

At that moment, the door to the ward opened, and Vanessa walked out.

Sebastian looked at her. "How is she?"

Vanessa calmly met his gaze. "I've examined her. There's nothing on Isabella's body. The mark on her neck that you mentioned must have been made by her boyfriend."

"Boyfriend?" Sebastian frowned slightly but didn't say anything more.

Vanessa said, "Do you want to go in and see her? She'll probably wake up soon."

"Not now," Sebastian's expression returned to normal. "I have something to do, so I'll leave. Remember to contact her family when she wakes up."

"Okay, Mr. Landon, don't worry."

Vanessa watched Sebastian leave before turning around and entering the ward.

Isabella had already woken up. Her eyes were open, but she still felt weak.

Vanessa walked over and sat down by the bed. "Isabella, you're awake? How do you feel? Are you feeling any better?"

Isabella nodded. "Are we at the hospital?"

"Yes." Vanessa poured her a glass of water and smiled. She said, "Mr. Landon brought you here. He even carried you."

The water in Isabella's mouth went down the wrong way, and she choked. "Mr. Landon?"

"Yeah," Vanessa teased. "Did Mr. Landon take a liking to you, Isabella? I've been with the company for over a year, and it's the first time I've seen him carry a woman."

Isabella's face turned red. "No way."

"Why not? You're good-looking, young, and in good shape. Many bosses like women like you. Isabella, if you don't have a boyfriend, maybe you should seriously consider Mr. Landon. Mr. Landon has good qualities..."

"I do have a boyfriend," Isabella interrupted her.

Vanessa stopped talking. "Really?"

Isabella bit her lip. "Yes."
###chapter 3 Leaving Nina's House
After receiving four bottles of saline, Isabella's fever subsided. However, the doctor said that she had a bacterial infection and inflammation in her body. Despite the temporary decline in fever, she still needed to stay in the hospital for two more days and receive two days of anti-inflammatory treatment.

In the evening, Nina Wilson, Isabella's sister, hurriedly pushed open the door. "Isabella, are you okay?"

When Isabella saw Nina, she wanted to cry. "I'm fine."

"How did you get so seriously ill?" Nina looked at Isabella in concern.

The two of them had lost their parents at a young age. Nina, who was seven years older than Isabella, had been taking care of her for many years. They had a deep bond.

Isabella didn't want Nina to worry, so she held back her tears and said, "I might have caught a cold and gotten a fever last night. It's okay, I'm much better now."

Nina relaxed a little when she saw that Isabella seemed to be in good spirits. She turned to Vanessa, who was standing by the bed. "And you are?"

"Hello, I'm Vanessa, Isabella's colleague." Vanessa politely extended her hand and shook hands with Nina.

"Oh, were you the one who took Isabella to the hospital?"

"No," Vanessa shook her head. "Our boss brought Isabella to the hospital. I just stayed with her for a day."

"Thank you. Isabella is gentle, and she's lucky to have a good colleague like you."

"You're too kind." Vanessa glanced at the time and speculated that Sebastian probably wouldn't come here, so she picked up her bag from the sofa. "Since you are here, please take care of Isabella. I'll head back."

Nina saw Vanessa out. When she came back, she asked Isabella, "That colleague of yours seems nice. Is she a new friend?"

Isabella shook her head, "We don't really talk to each other at work."

Vanessa was usually friendly, but she was closest to Laura in the department. Isabella was not fond of talking and only focused on her work in the company without socializing. She actually found it strange that Vanessa had been particularly enthusiastic toward her today.

"Well, she's really nice to stay with you here for a day."

"Yeah."

Isabella thought that she would have to find an opportunity to repay Vanessa. She doesn't like owing favors to other people.

Nina said the hospital was too noisy and it would be better to go back and rest at home. Isabella didn't find it noisy, but she felt a bit scared without Nina by her side, so she agreed.

As they walked out of the hospital, a gust of cool wind blew. Isabella felt a weight on her shoulders. Nina had draped her coat over her. Even though Nina was dressed lightly, she only cared about protecting Isabella. Isabella pursed her lips and quickened her pace to hail a taxi.

In the car, Isabella's brother-in-law, Charlie Wilson, called and said he had a dinner engagement in the evening and wouldn't be back until late, so they didn't have to wait for him to have dinner. Nina gave a few reminders, but Charlie impatiently responded with a couple of perfunctory sentences and hung up the phone.

Isabella held Nina's hand and said, "I want to have your cooking for dinner."

Nina smiled and replied, "Alright, I'll cook for you when we get home."

"Okay."

When they arrived home, Nina took Isabella into the bedroom, placed a pillow behind her back, poured her a cup of hot water, and anxiously touched her forehead. "You rest on this pillow. I'll go cook. It will be ready soon. If you need anything, just call me."

Isabella obediently nodded and said, "Okay."

Nina put on an apron and went to the kitchen to cook.

When Isabella heard the sounds coming from the kitchen, she lifted the blanket and got off the bed, quietly entering Nina's bedroom. She opened Nina's bedside table and easily found the abortion pills inside. She quickly glanced at the instructions on the pillbox, plucked out two pills, and swallowed them.

After dinner, Isabella took a bath. As she stood in front of the mirror, her clothes discarded, she looked at the marks on her body and recalled the wild night before, still feeling a lingering fear.

Isabella didn't sleep soundly that night, probably because she had overslept during the day, or perhaps because she still felt unwell. In a dazed state, she heard arguing outside. She rubbed her forehead and got up, opening the bedroom door slightly.

The living room light was on, and a man's tie and socks were scattered on the floor. Charlie was lying on the couch, reeking of alcohol.

Nina was tidying up while saying, "I told you to drink less. If you keep drinking like this, you'll have a hangover again tomorrow..."

"You're so annoying. Do you think I want to drink like this? I'm only doing it for you, for this family, for your sister. Otherwise, I wouldn't be so exhausted."

Nina was annoyed and said, "Don't talk about Isabella."

"Why not?" Charlie's voice raised. "She spends my money. Why can't I talk about her? You spoil her too much!"

"Isabella has found a job. She's been paying for her own expenses since her freshman year. What do you mean she spends your money?" Nina defended Isabella.

Charlie pointed at her. "Fine! Then tell her to move out tomorrow. I can't stand seeing her!"

"Isabella is my sister, and she's my only family. She hasn't even graduated from college, and she's only just found a job. You can't kick her out."

Charlie looked very angry. "This is my house. I bought it with my money, and I'm the one paying the mortgage every month. I have the final say. If I tell her to get lost, she has to get lost!"

"You..." Nina cried out of anger.

Charlie fell asleep, completely drunk.

After a while, Nina wiped away her tears and went to wake Charlie. "Go take a shower and go back to your room to sleep."

Isabella quietly closed the door and lay back on the bed, but she couldn't fall asleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, she woke up early and made breakfast. She left an envelope and a note for Nina, then took her suitcase with her out of Nina's house.

Nina had married Charlie because of Isabella. Nina had always said that they had suffered a lot since they were women, and having a man at home would prevent anyone from picking on them. Nina didn't have much education and couldn't earn a lot of money from her small business. Nina's dream was to own a house and settle down.

Charlie had an ordinary college degree and now worked for a publicly listed company. At first, he was a decent man, but he had become increasingly restless due to mounting pressure. He would come home drunk and start arguing with Nina.

Because of Isabella, Nina had to suppress her own emotions and compromise during every fight she had with Charlie.

Isabella knew that Nina still loved Charlie. There was love between them. She didn't want to be a burden to them. Moving out was also a way for them to have a better life.

The elevator stopped on the eighth floor.

When the door opened, Isabella saw the person standing at the door. It was someone she didn't want to see.
###chapter 4 Art and Reality
Before all this, Isabella had never thought that her boyfriend and her best friend would have an affair. She had always believed that things like that only existed in absurd movies. Isabella finally understood that art imitates life when it actually happened to her.

She still remembered the shock she felt when she pushed open the door of her school dorm and saw Matthew Landon and Samantha Cook entangled with each other. One was her best friend, and the other was the person she relied on most besides Nina. Yet, they had hurt Isabella's heart in the dirtiest way possible.

"Bella?" Samantha hesitated.

But Isabella had already averted her gaze and moved her suitcase inside.

She had no intention of exchanging pleasantries with them. After all, the past was in the past. She had broken up with Matthew and her friendship with Samantha had ended. She didn't want anything to do with these two people anymore.

Samantha walked in, holding Matthew's arm. The elevator doors closed. Samantha turned and said to Isabella, "I heard you found a job. Are you going on a business trip?"

Isabella kept her head down and replied, just to get through the conversation.

Samantha didn't say anything more when she saw her reaction.

When the elevator reached the first floor, Isabella walked out with her suitcase. Unexpectedly, one of the suitcase wheels got stuck in a gap. Isabella tried to pull the suitcase with all her might, but it didn't budge.

Just when she didn't know what to do, Matthew reached out his hand. He gently pushed, and the wheel came out.

"Thank you," Isabella muttered, embarrassed, as she pulled the suitcase behind her and hurried away.

The elevator doors closed again and continued to descend.

Samantha glanced at Matthew, her tone unclear, and said, "Bella seems to have changed a lot. I don't know if she's still mad at us. Should I try to see her and apologize?"

"Is that necessary?" Matthew replied blandly. "Things have already turned out like this. Would an apology make a difference?"

Samantha pursed her lips, feeling wronged. "Are you blaming me, Matthew?"

Matthew didn't say anything.

Samantha pulled her hand out of Matthew's arm. "Matthew, if you still have feelings for Bella, I'll go and explain it to her. It was my fault, I'll take responsibility. Bella is gentle, she'll probably forgive you..."

The elevator doors opened. The basement parking lot was brightly lit.

Samantha ran out of the elevator crying, only to be faced with a speeding car. The honking pierced through the air. Samantha stood in the middle of the road, seemingly unresponsive, and raised her hand to shield her eyes but forgot to move out of the way.

Fortunately, Matthew quickly reached out and pulled her back. The screeching brakes of the car were ear-piercing. The car barely passed by the two of them and stopped. The terrified driver stuck his head out of the window, cursed a few times, and then drove away.

"Are you out of your mind?" Matthew held Samantha's wrist tightly. His voice was trembling, too.

That had been dangerous. If Matthew had been a second late, Samantha would have been hit and sent flying.

Samantha's face turned pale from the scare. Tears kept rolling down her eyes. She cried uncontrollably, burying her head in Matthew's arms, unable to say a word.

Matthew sighed and reached out to embrace her, gently comforting her. "Stop crying..."

--

Isabella took the car back to her school dormitory. It was the only place she could stay after leaving Nina's house. There were originally four people living in the dormitory. Since it was the second half of their senior year, everyone had found jobs and moved out one by one.

Isabella didn't usually live here, but her things were still there.

Before the cheating incident happened, Samantha had been the only one living here. She hadn't found a job yet because her family was from out of town.

That night, Isabella had come over because she heard from a classmate that there was a power outage in the dormitory. She was worried that Samantha would be alone and scared, so she wanted to come and keep her company. However, when she pushed the door open, she had seen that scene...

Now, Samantha didn't live here anymore. Matthew rented a house for her.

Since Isabella joined the Landon Group, she had been busy working long hours. She had bumped into them in Nina's neighborhood today, which surprised her.

Surprisingly, the house that Matthew rented for Samantha was in the same neighborhood as Nina's house.

Isabella no longer wanted to think about whether this was a coincidence or intentional. She now just felt that moving away was the right decision. She didn't want to see them again.

After Isabella made the bed, her phone rang.

It was a call from Nina. Nina sounded like she had been crying. "Bella, what's going on with you? You left without saying goodbye to me. Where are you? I'll come find you."

Isabella leaned against the bed rail. "I moved back to the dorms at school. Once I finish my internship, I can apply for employee housing at the company..."

"I have a room at my place. Why would you live in employee housing? Wait, I'll come pick you up..."

"No!" Isabella called out solemnly.

Nina instantly became quiet as well.

Isabella controlled her emotions, looked up at the ceiling, and pretended to be casual. "I've grown up. I don't want to be a burden to you, and I want to be someone you can rely on."

Nina sat on a bench in the entryway, holding the phone, and cried. Wiping her tears, she said, "I don't need someone to rely on; I just need you by my side. No matter how old you are, you'll always be my little sister."

"Thank you, but I really want to be independent this time. You'll support me, right?"

Nina's voice was hoarse. "If I didn't support you, would you immediately pack up and come back?"

"No, I wouldn't," Isabella smiled. Her tears silently fell. "You've always supported me since I was young, no matter what I did. You're the best sister in the world."

Nina didn't speak for a long time. Although she tried her best to restrain herself, Isabella still heard her quiet sobbing.

"I'll buy you a bigger house when I make some money! I'll open a store for you, so you and your husband won't have to work so hard anymore."

Only then did Nina laugh. "I don't want a big house, and I don't want to open a store. You and I are just ordinary people. We don't expect to live a wealthy life. I don't want anything, Bella. I just want you to be safe and happy. That'll be enough for me."

"Okay," Isabella nodded heavily. "I will!"

After hanging up the phone, Isabella cried sadly for a while.

Someone knocked on the door.

Isabella wiped away her tears to open the door. The daylight outside seemed to have turned into darkness. 

Sebastian's face appeared in front of her.
###chapter 5 What Have You Done
"Ah," Isabella exclaimed as she woke up from her dream. When she opened her eyes, she realized she was lying in a hospital bed.

The older woman in the next bed smiled and asked, "Did you have a nightmare, Young lady? I noticed that you kept clutching the sheets when you were asleep. What did you dream about?"

As a child, Isabella had heard that it was unlucky to talk about nightmares.

Since the old woman had asked, she casually replied, "I dreamed about my boss."

The old woman was taken aback and shook her head as she sighed. "Your boss must be very frightening."

As soon as she finished speaking, the door to the ward opened from the outside, and a tall figure appeared.

Isabella was about to get out of bed to go to the bathroom. With one foot in her shoe, she saw the visitor and almost slipped off the bed.

Sebastian was wearing a white shirt with a slightly open collar. The black trousers accentuated his well-proportioned and strong legs. He held a thermos in one hand and had a black suit jacket draped over the other, exuding a sense of elegance.

Isabella met his gaze and felt guilty. Her hand resting by the bed involuntarily clenched.

However, Sebastian walked past her and went straight to the old woman's bed beside him. He lowered his head and called out, "Grandma."

Isabella looked up in astonishment and saw the old woman, Zoe Landon, lovingly stroking Sebastian's head. And Sebastian, who was usually imposing at the company, appeared to be pliant in front of the elderly woman. He was her grandson.

Under Isabella's surprised gaze, Sebastian opened the lid of the thermos and scooped out some soup for Zoe. Isabella couldn't help but be a little dumbfounded to see that the cold-faced president had such a tender side.

Zoe waved her hand repeatedly, saying, "I just ate an apple, so I can't eat anymore."

When she turned her head and saw Isabella, Zoe said, "You haven't eaten yet, young lady? This is perfect. My grandson brought soup. Do you want to try some?"

Sebastian looked at her, too, but Isabella was too scared to respond. She shook her head repeatedly. "No, no, I'm not hungry..."

Zoe, however, was very enthusiastic. "Are you rejecting my cooking?"

"Of course not."

"That's good," Zoe smiled and pushed Sebastian toward her. "Go on. That poor girl looks like she's having a hard time. It's been a while, but I haven't seen any of her family come to visit. By the way, she just had a nightmare and saw her boss. The poor girl was scared. I guess her boss isn't a good person..."

Isabella tried to interrupt several times but couldn't get a word in. Zoe was really someone who spoke her mind!

Sebastian raised an eyebrow and looked at Isabella. "Is that so? Did you do something to make you so afraid of your boss?"

Isabella felt helpless.

She felt like she couldn't explain it clearly.

Sebastian continued to stare at her as if he could read her thoughts.

"I... I'm going to the restroom. You guys continue talking," Isabella said, escaping into the bathroom.

Smack!

Zoe slapped Sebastian's hand. Zoe scolded, "Look, you scared the little girl."

Sebastian smiled helplessly. "Am I really that scary Grandma?"

He may be strict during work, but Isabella wasn't that scared of him, right?

"Yes!" Zoe scrutinized him seriously. "You don't look scary, but you always have a serious expression that can be intimidating. That little girl is timid. I think she's kind and knows her boundaries. I really like her..."

"Stop!" Sebastian interrupted Zoe with a headache. "She has a boyfriend. Don't get any ideas, Grandma."

But Zoe didn't believe him. "She has a boyfriend? How do you know?"

"Because she's my employee."

"Ah."

---

When Isabella came out of the restroom, Sebastian was the only one in the ward.

He looked at her when she came out.

Isabella froze for a moment, then awkwardly moved back to the bed. There were needles on the back of her hand, and she held a saline bag high with her other hand. She tried to hang the bag up on the stand but failed a few times due to her height and restricted movement.

"Give that to me." A low male voice reached her ears. Isabella turned around in a daze and smelled a refreshing scent. At the same time, the saline bag landed on Sebastian's fingers, and he easily hung it up for her.

"Thank you, Mr. Landon," Isabella said, keeping her head down and not daring to make eye contact with him.

She sat on the bed, and Sebastian brought her a thermos, placing it on her bedside table. "This is for you."

Isabella was very surprised and looked up at him. When their eyes met, she quickly lowered her head again, blushing.

Sebastian found it very interesting. He had met many girls, but Isabella was the first to be so shy. She was like a bashful flower that would blush at even the slightest touch. It was quite amusing.

To prevent her from getting the wrong idea, Sebastian added, "My grandma gave it to me."

"I'll thank her later," Isabella said.

Sebastian stood by the bed for a while. "There's one more thing I wanted to ask you."

"Please, go ahead."

He took something out of his pants pocket and handed it to her. "Have you seen this before?"

Isabella's pupils contracted. It was her bracelet!

How did the bracelet end up with Sebastian?

Sebastian observed her expression. "Have you seen it before?"

Isabella snapped out of her thoughts and shook her head. "No, never."

Sebastian was disappointed. "Are you sure you haven't seen it before?"

"Yes," Isabella nervously clenched her fists. "I've never seen it before."

"Okay." Sebastian took the bracelet back. Isabella's heart, however, was in turmoil. She hadn't realized she had left something behind with Sebastian, and something so important at that!

When Isabella was a child, she used to fall ill frequently. Nina had made that bracelet for her to make her happy. Over the years, Isabella had always kept the bracelet with her, but it was always hidden up her sleeve. 

Apart from a few close people around her, no one else knew about this bracelet. She had no friends in the company, so no one would know. Therefore, she didn't need to worry too much about Sebastian finding out. But she worried about how she would retrieve the bracelet.

In the afternoon, Vanessa sent her a few messages, asking how she was doing. Out of politeness, Isabella replied. Since she and Vanessa weren't close, the conversation seemed like it was ending after they exchanged a few forced pleasantries.

However, Vanessa sent another message: [Isabella, has Mr. Landon been to the hospital?] 

They were both Sebastian's assistants. Isabella wasn't sure if Vanessa needed to speak to Sebastian, so she honestly replied: [He came at noon.] Soon, Vanessa called her.
###chapter 6 Don't Wake Her
"Hello. Isabella, are you feeling better?" Vanessa asked, concerned, as soon as Isabella answered the phone. 

Isabella nodded. "I'm much better."

"Are you still running a fever? Did you have lunch? Are you hungry? Should I order some takeout for you? Or is there anything specific you'd like to eat? I can bring it over." Faced with Vanessa's care, Isabella was puzzled, since they weren't really close. Vanessa's concern seemed sudden and excessive.

But Vanessa meant well, and Isabella couldn't refuse, so she responded to her questions one by one, "I'm not running a fever anymore. I had lunch already. I'm not hungry, but if I do get hungry, I'll order takeout. Thank you for your concern, Vanessa."

"Oh..." Vanessa hesitated slightly. "Is... Is Mr. Landon still there?"

"He's gone."

"Did he come just to see you?"

"No." Isabella didn't mention Sebastian's grandmother being in the hospital. After all, Sebastian was her boss, and if she said something out of place, it could affect her job.

Vanessa was puzzled. "Why did Mr. Landon go to the hospital then?"

"He seemed... to be visiting a friend," Isabella vaguely replied.

"Mr. Landon has a friend in the hospital?" Vanessa continued to inquire.

Isabella pursed her lips. "I don't know the specifics."

"Oh," Vanessa sounded disappointed. She continued, "I'm free tonight. What do you want to eat? I can bring it over for you."

"You don't have to do that. I won't be staying at the hospital tonight," Isabella politely declined, feeling a bit overwhelmed by Vanessa's enthusiasm.

"Alright then. Get some rest. Don't worry about work. I'll take care of it for you."

"Thank you, Vanessa."

"You're welcome. We're colleagues, after all. Get some rest, goodbye."

"Okay."

After hanging up, Vanessa leaned back in her chair, frowning in thought.

Laura slid her chair over. "Since when did you have such a good relationship with that intern? Are you planning on bringing her food?"

Vanessa waved her hand. "I feel sorry for her, that's all."

"What's there to feel sorry for?" Laura dismissed her. "I've seen plenty of newcomers like her in the workplace. She pretends to be weak and sorry for herself just because she's young, so she can gain sympathy and help with her work. You all care about her, but she's nothing in my eyes."

Vanessa smiled and didn't say anything, but she thought about whether to go to the hospital that night.

---

When Isabella's IV drip finished, it was past 5 p.m.

She was originally planning to go back to the school dormitory, but when she saw that Zoe was by herself and lonely, she decided to stay with her a little longer until Sebastian arrived.

Not long after, the door to the ward opened, and Nina walked in carrying a lunchbox.

"Why are you here?" Isabella got up to greet her.

Nina put the umbrella she was holding in the corner and smiled. "I brought you some dinner. Are you hungry?"

The lunchbox was filled with Isabella's favorite food.

"Don't worry. I can take care of it myself."

The hospital was far away from their home. Isabella couldn't bear to see Nina going back and forth for her, and she was worried that Charlie would pick a fight with Nina, causing conflict between them.

Nina understood her thoughts and reassured her by patting her hand. "Charlie has a social event tonight. It's raining, and I can't open the stall. I'd be bored at home alone, so I thought I'd come to the hospital and keep you company."

Isabella nodded.

She took two tissues and wiped the water off Nina's shoulders.

"How nice." Zoe raised her hand and wiped away a tear. "I have a sister, too, but she passed away when she was young. You two are just like us. If my sister were still here, she would definitely come to visit me..."

Her words made Isabella and Nina sad.

Nina said, "The people who have passed away will always love us, Ma'am. Don't be too sad. If your sister knew you were grieving for her, she would be sad too."

"Yes." Zoe smiled awkwardly. "Sorry for embarrassing you."

"No problem," Nina said. "No matter how old we are, we all have someone we care about. We need to cherish the present, even if we miss those who have passed away."

Zoe nodded repeatedly, saying, "Yes."

Nina took out the food. "Ma'am, you haven't eaten yet, have you? Would you like to try the food I made?"

Zoe was very happy. "Sure. I happen to be hungry too."

The three of them sat around the bed and started eating.

___

The Landon Group.

Vanessa finished typing the last word, saved the document, and looked up to see Sebastian walking out of the office. Sebastian checked his watch while walking and seemed to be in a hurry.

Vanessa immediately closed her computer and followed him.

As Vanessa walked out, she saw Sebastian standing at the door, waiting for a car in the pouring rain.

She approached him. "Have you just finished work too, Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian turned to look at her, his expression cold. "Yes."

Vanessa stared at the rain, looking anxious. "Oh no, I forgot to bring food for Isabella since I was working overtime."

Sebastian look at her again when he heard that. "What did you say?"

"I promised to visit Isabella tonight and bring her dinner, but I got too busy and forgot." Vanessa held her phone. "It's difficult to get a cab in this heavy rain."

Sebastian asked, "Are you going to the hospital?"

"Yes."

At that moment, the driver brought the car over and stopped in front of them.

Sebastian said, "Get in, I'm going there too."

Vanessa didn't hesitate and got into the car.
___

When they pushed open the door to the ward, a tranquil scene awaited them inside.

Zoe was leaning against the bed, and Isabella was sleeping.

The sound of the TV was very low, blending with the rain outside like a lullaby.

"As Vanessa was about to speak, she saw Sebastian raise his hand. He didn't go in but instead stepped out of the ward and gently closed the door.

Vanessa stood behind him, looking puzzled. "Mr. Landon?"

"She hasn't slept that soundly for a long time. Don't wake her up." Even though Sebastian had stepped outside the ward, his voice was still low, seemingly afraid to disturb the quiet sleep inside.

Vanessa was very surprised. It had only been a day, but Sebastian was already so attentive to Isabella. Had he discovered her secret?

Vanessa thought about it again and realized something was off.

If Sebastian knew the truth, then he would also know about the thing she had deliberately kept hidden. 

Sebastian hated deception, so there was no way he would calmly take her to the hospital with him.

Vanessa couldn't understand.

Sebastian took the lunchbox from her hands. "You head back first. I'll give this to Isabella." 

Vanessa nodded reluctantly. "Thank you."
###chapter 7 Was It You That Night
Sebastian first went to the doctor's office and inquired about Zoe's test results. When he returned to the ward, Isabella was awake, bending over to cover Zoe with a blanket. 

When she heard a sound, she turned around, her eyes still filled with a sleepy daze. "Mr. Landon."

Her voice was soft, and it made his heart soften, too. Sebastian nodded gently. "Thank you for taking care of Zoe."

He had guessed why she hadn't left. Zoe wouldn't just praise anyone easily, so it was evident that Isabella had some excellent qualities.

"You don't have to be so polite. I didn't do much. Besides... you got me lunch today."

She had eaten his lunch and didn't want to owe him any favors, so it wasn't hard for her to help take care of Zoe.

Sebastian looked at her and asked, "How did lunch taste?"

"Huh?" Isabella didn't expect him to ask that and was stunned for a moment. She said somewhat embarrassedly, "It was pretty good, just a bit bland."

"Yes." Sebastian wasn't angry and calmly accepted her opinion. He explained, "My grandmother can't eat too much salt, so I put less in."

Isabella was surprised. "So you made that soup?"

Before Sebastian could answer, Zoe's voice rang out. "He made it. He doesn't just know how to make soup. He can also cook, do laundry, change light bulbs, and repair appliances. When you have time, come to our house and see his skills."

Isabella turned around. Zoe, who had been sleeping soundly just a moment ago, had opened her eyes and was smiling at Sebastian and Isabella.

Isabella had to compliment him when she heard that. "You're really amazing, Mr. Landon."

She had seen many people who were good at work but lacking in life skills. But obviously, Sebastian was not one of those people. He was very capable in his daily life, which was not what she expected from a workaholic CEO.

Sebastian didn't respond but opened the lunchbox for Zoe.

Zoe waved her hand. "I already had dinner."

"You had dinner already?" Sebastian was somewhat surprised. Zoe was even pickier than him when it came to food, and she usually never ate outside.

Zoe smiled and said, "Isabella's sister came to deliver dinner. I ate with them."

Sebastian put away the lunchbox. "Let me wipe your face then."

"No need. Isabella already helped me with that. You don't have to." 

Sebastian was speechless.

Isabella picked up her bag. "It's getting late, Mr. Landon, so I'll head back now. Goodbye, Zoe."

"Goodbye, goodbye," Zoe smiled and waved at her as she left.

As soon as Isabella left, Sebastian chuckled and said, "You seem to really like Isabella, don't you?
"
"I do like her. What about you? Do you like her too?" With no one else around, Zoe became more straightforward. "I've done some investigating, and Isabella broke up with her boyfriend. She's single now. If you want to do something, you should act fast."

Sebastian looked helpless.
-------
Isabella stood outside the hospital, waiting for a car. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew, and icy rain hit her face. She instinctively raised her hand to shield herself, but someone pulled it away.

As Isabella smelled the man's fragrance, she stared blankly at the person in front of her. "Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian held her wrist. Her skin was softer than he had imagined, and he couldn't help but want to squeeze it. He suppressed his impulsive thoughts and whispered, "Why do you blush every time you see me?"

Isabella felt shy when she heard that. "I... I'm just... just..."

She struggled to finish her sentence, but Sebastian didn't interrupt her. He just silently watched her, enjoying the sight of her rosy cheeks.

A breeze blew, and he caught Isabella's unique scent. His eyes narrowed instantly. With a little force, he pulled Isabella toward him, causing her to collide with his embrace.

Before Isabella could react, he lowered his head and smelled her neck.

"Mr. Landon!" Isabella exclaimed with wide eyes.

She felt a cooling sensation on her neck. Sebastian's nose lightly brushed against her neck.

Isabella's heart raced. She pushed Sebastian away and hurriedly ran into the rain...

-------

Forty minutes later, she returned to her dorm room.

Isabella was drenched from head to toe. As she climbed up the stairs, she took out her key to open the door but saw someone standing at the entrance of the dorm.

Isabella's legs went weak. She stopped in her tracks and couldn't move forward.

Sebastian stubbed out his cigarette and approached her.

His tall figure gradually approached her. Isabella wanted to run, but she was frozen in place. She could only watch him come closer, and in a hoarse voice, she called out, "Mr. Landon."

Isabella was completely soaked. The rain dripped down her hair and clothes, and the ground quickly became wet. Her eyes were slightly red. Feeling cold, she shivered.

"Why did you run away?" Sebastian's anger disappeared as soon as he spoke. That fragile little girl just couldn't make him angry. He only wanted to protect her.

Sebastian apologized since he felt guilty for scaring her at the hospital. "I'm sorry. I went too far. I didn't mean anything by it, I just happened to smell your perfume... Can you tell me, was it you that night?"

His gaze locked onto her as if it carried flames. It seemed like even though Isabella was wet, he could ignite her in an instant.

Isabella shook her head and stepped back. "I... don't know what you're talking about."

Sebastian reached out and grabbed her wrist, holding her firmly and preventing her from retreating. His gaze was fixed on her. He asked, "Was it you who entered my tent on the night of the camping trip?"

"It wasn't me..." Isabella denied.

Sebastian fell silent for a moment, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Do you dare prove it to me?"

Isabella widened her eyes, her pupils flickering. After a long time, she answered, "I do!"

---

As soon as the dormitory door closed, the room fell into darkness.

The light switch clicked.

Isabella turned on the desk lamp, making the surroundings a bit brighter.

She slowly turned her back, unbuttoning her buttons one by one. Sebastian stood behind the door, staring at her.

That woman from that night had left many fingerprints on him; they were marks she had left behind in extreme pleasure. Sebastian remembered that he hadn't been gentle either; he had also left his mark on the woman. If Isabella was that woman, there would definitely be traces on her body!
###chapter 8 His Compensation
When her shirt was removed, Sebastian's eyes fell on Isabella's flawless back.

He was disappointed and turned his head away. He apologized in a heavy voice, "I'm sorry."

Isabella pulled the bed sheet over herself. There was humiliation in her eyes. "Have I proven myself, Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian opened his mouth, but he felt that anything he said now would be futile.

As he left, he glanced at the second floor. There was still a faint light inside the window. He thought about Isabella's delicate appearance, wondering if she was covering her face and crying at that moment.

Sebastian picked up the phone and dialed Jack's number. "Prepare a gift for me, something for a girl, and make it exquisite."

---

As soon as Sebastian left, Isabella locked the door and took her clean pajamas to the bathroom.

She took off her outer clothes. Although the marks on her chest had faded a bit, they were still very noticeable. There weren't many marks on her back, and they had recovered quickly after she had applied some ointment, so Sebastian wouldn't have noticed them just now.

However, Isabella was still scared out of her wits. She didn't know what the consequences would be once Sebastian found out about this. She only knew that the Landon Group strictly forbade dating between colleagues.

She had fought hard to get this job, and she couldn't just lose it like this. So, she had to keep this secret and absolutely not let Sebastian know!

After quickly taking a shower, she climbed into bed and fell asleep.

Early the next morning, Isabella bought two breakfasts, one for herself and one for Zoe. As she hung the IV drip and was pretending to play with her phone, the hospital room door burst open. Thinking it was Sebastian, she pretended to keep her head down.

"Grandma," a familiar voice sounded beside her.

Isabella was startled and looked up, and sure enough, it was Matthew.

Seemingly aware of her gaze, Matthew turned his head to look at her. Isabella didn't have time to avert her gaze. They locked eyes.

Zoe introduced them with a smile. "This is Isabella. Bella, this is my other grandson, Matthew."

Zoe was always concise when introducing people. Isabella secretly breathed a sigh of relief. She had been worried that Zoe would mention that she worked for the Landon Group, since she had told Sebastian everything before.

"Hello, Isabella," Matthew looked at her with warmth in his eyes.

Isabella simply nodded politely and lowered her head to continue looking at her phone.

Matthew's gaze became peculiar, but he didn't say anything.

A moment later, the medical staff came to take Zoe for an examination. Matthew stayed behind, sitting in a corner of the hospital room and sending messages.

Isabella grew tired of playing with her phone and turned off the screen, intending to rest for a while. However, when she looked up, she met Matthew's gaze. In that instant, Isabella had a feeling that he had been staring at her for a long time.

As Isabella was about to avert her gaze, Matthew spoke up, "Weren't you supposed to be on a business trip? Why are you here in the hospital?"

Isabella pursed her lips and picked up her phone again. But this time, she didn't look at it for long before it was snatched from her hands. Isabella looked up at Matthew standing by her bed and asked, "Do you have something to say?"

Matthew looked at her and said, "Why aren't you answering my question?"

Isabella bit her lip and countered, "Why should I answer your question? And may I ask who you are to me right now?"

Matthew remained silent for a few seconds and then asked, "Are you blaming me?"

"You're thinking too much. We already broke up," Isabella said softly.

"We broke up, but don't I have the right to explain myself?" Matthew said.

Isabella remained silent.

Matthew continued, "What happened between Samantha and me was an accident."

Isabella still didn't say anything.

Looking at the top of her head, Matthew said, "I know you must think I'm shifting the blame. But whether you believe it or not, Isabella, it only happened one time. I haven't touched Samantha since then.

"I regret what happened that night, but it already happened. The only thing I could do was break up with you and take responsibility with Samantha. I was also trying to be responsible for you. Do you understand?"

Isabella felt heartbroken as she listened to those words. She had said that she didn't care about this, that it was all in the past, but deep down, she still cared. 

After all, she had really loved Matthew. They had dated with the intention of spending the rest of their lives together. She had planned to bring up a marriage with Matthew after she officially settled down and had a stable job, but she hadn't expected something like this to happen.

Tears welled up in Isabella's eyes, and they fell onto the bed.

"Isabella, I'm sorry..." Matthew reached out his hand. His palm gently rested on the top of her head.

Just then, the door to the hospital room opened, and Sebastian appeared in the doorway.

"Brother." Matthew withdrew his hand and took two steps back, creating some distance between him and Isabella.

Sebastian's gaze swept over Isabella and landed on Matthew's face. "What are you doing here?"

"I heard Grandma was sick. Mom asked me to come see her," Matthew explained.

"Have you seen Grandma?" Sebastian's expression turned cold, showing little enthusiasm toward his younger brother.

"Yes."

Sebastian walked in and put down the things he was holding. When he saw that Matthew hadn't left, a trace of impatience appeared on his face. "Aren't you leaving?"

Matthew frowned. "Dad hasn't been in Lakina lately. Mom said if you're too busy, you can send Grandma back, and she can take care of her..."

"No need." Sebastian interrupted him. "We don't need any outsiders worrying about Grandma's affairs."

The atmosphere in the hospital room became tense.

Finally, Matthew turned around and lightly said, "I'll go now, then."

----

After Matthew left, Isabella looked up at Sebastian.

He seemed to be in a bad mood, his brow furrowed. His expression was even colder than it usually was at the company.

Sebastian turned his head to look at her and calmly asked, "Do you know each other?"

Isabella instinctively wanted to deny it, but she felt that Sebastian had already guessed they did know each other, so she nodded.

He didn't ask any further questions and walked over, placing the bag he was holding in front of her. "This is for you."

He paused and added, "As compensation."

Compensation for last night.

Isabella's face turned red as she shook her head and said, "No, thank you."

He had only glanced at her back, which was nothing compared to seeing her in a swimsuit at the beach. 

However, Isabella was easily frightened and felt guilty, so her reaction was intense.

Sebastian gently said, "No, you have to take it. I can't rest easy if you don't."

Isabella wanted to say something more, but the medical staff pushed Zoe back into the room.

---

Isabella stayed in the hospital for three days and was discharged on the fourth day. The doctor gave her some medication to take home and offered a few reminders.

When Isabelle said goodbye to Zoe, Zoe held her hand tightly, not wanting to let go. Isabella also felt a bit sad.

When Sebastian saw that, he said, "She's an employee at my company. If you want to see her, you can go to the company to meet her."

"Really?"

"Yes."

At Sebastian's assurance, Zoe finally let go of Isabella's hand.

Isabella left the hospital in the afternoon. Sebastian gave her an extra half-day off to rest and told her to come to work at the company tomorrow.

As soon as Isabella returned to her dorm, she saw Samantha.
###chapter 9 A Precious Gift
Isabella pushed open the door and saw Samantha standing by her bed, holding the scarf that Sebastian had given her.

"Bella?" Samantha hurriedly put the things back into her bag and walked over to hold Isabella's hand. "Bella, when did you move back to the dorm? Why didn't you tell me?"

Isabella pulled her hand back and walked past her without saying a word. "Didn't you move out?"

"Yeah, I came back to get some things," Samantha walked toward her, pointing at the bag on the hanger. "Bella, is that scarf yours?"

"It's mine." Isabella looked at her with a distant look in her eyes. "Is there a problem?"

"No." Samantha's smile was forced. "That's a limited edition scarf from a famous brand that was released just last month. It's not only expensive, but also difficult to get. I wanted to ask, how did you manage to get it? I want one too."

Isabella glanced at the bag and saw the logo of that well-known brand. Sebastian had given it to her, and she hadn't intended to accept it, let alone take a close look at it. She hadn't expected it to be so precious.

"A friend gave it to me," Isabella casually replied. "I'm not really sure."

"Which friend?" Samantha pressed, her eyes showing her disbelief. She had been Isabella's best friend for many years and knew her well. Besides her and Matthew, Isabella didn't have any other friends.

Isabella indifferently said, "You don't know him."

As Samantha was going to ask more, her phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID and didn't hesitate to answer it in front of Isabella. "Hello, Matthew... Yes, I'm in the dormitory. Right. I want to have a big meal at noon, the one we went to last time... Okay. I'll come see you later."

After hanging up, Samantha said, "Rest well, Bella. I'll leave now."

Isabella couldn't even be bothered to respond. She saw on the bed and opened her laptop.

Samantha just shrugged and left the dormitory.

---

At the restaurant, Samantha ordered a few dishes and handed the menu to Matthew.

Matthew glanced at it and crossed out a few dishes. "Are you going to finish all this?"

"It doesn't matter if I can't finish it. I just want to taste a little bit of everything," Samantha said nonchalantly, adding expensive foie gras to the order.

Matthew glanced at her. "Why didn't I notice you were so wasteful before?"

Back when he was dating Isabella, he would occasionally bring Samantha along for meals. At that time, Samantha was always reserved and even more shy than Isabella. Later, Matthew learned that it was because Samantha was from a poor family and had low self-esteem.

He remembered one time, when the three of them finished eating and left, Samantha went back to the private room to get the leftovers packed up. The Samantha from back then and the Samantha who was enjoying this extravagant meal now seemed like two different people.

Noticing his gaze, Samantha closed the menu. "Did I order too much? Are you telling me you don't want to spend the money?"

"It's not that," Matthew's family had money. Both of his parents were professors. He didn't care about these expenses. Ever since he started dating Samantha, he would bring her to these upscale places, and he never felt that there was anything wrong before. 

Perhaps he had realized how much both he and Samantha had changed because he had seen Isabella at the hospital today. Isabella seemed to have remained the same as before.

"Matthew? What's wrong with you?" Samantha waved her hand in front of his eyes. "Do you have something on your mind? Why are you so absent-minded tonight?"

Matthew snapped back to reality. "It's nothing."

Samantha nonchalantly sliced the foie gras and said, "Bella moved back to the school dormitory."

Matthew's utensils paused, and he calmly said, "Is that so?"

In the afternoon, Matthew had returned to his dorm to retrieve something when he bumped into her. She was holding a big brand-name bag, and inside was the scarf he had been wanting. Bella said it was a gift from a friend, so he asked her which friend, but she hadn't given him a clear answer. Samantha, speaking to Matthew, looked toward him.

Matthew frowned. "Really?"

Samantha lifted her chin with an innocent face, and said, "I thought maybe you secretly bought it for her."

"Me?" Matthew shook his head. "No, it wasn't me."

"I knew it wasn't you. Even if it was from you, I wouldn't be mad. We've done something to hurt her. If a scarf can ease Bella's resentment, I'm willing to give her that. But... Bella doesn't have any other friends besides us. Besides, even if it was just an ordinary friend, they probably wouldn't give her such a valuable gift, right? I wonder if Bella has a new boyfriend?"

Matthew put down his utensils. "I'm going to the bathroom."

Samantha's words had made him uncomfortable. Matthew went to the bathroom and smoked a cigarette to calm down.

After finishing the cigarette, he remembered something and reached into his pocket, only to realize that his phone was still on the dining table.

Samantha quickly took the phone, unlocked the screen, and browsed through several overseas shopping apps. To be honest, she still couldn't believe that someone would give Isabella such an expensive gift, except for Matthew.

But after searching, she only found the order for the scarf that Matthew had placed earlier.

When she clicked on it, Samantha's expression changed. She had really wanted that scarf and had fallen in love with it at first sight when it had just been released. She had asked Matthew for it for a long time before he agreed to buy it for her. She had been eagerly waiting to get the scarf to show it off, but Matthew told her that he hadn't managed to get it.

And now she saw that he hadn't failed to get the scarf; instead, he had canceled the order.

Why had he canceled the order? The answer was simple. Matthew didn't want to give it to her!

Two minutes later, Matthew returned to the dining table. He glanced at his phone. The phone was still in its original position, as if it hadn't been moved.

Samantha handed him the foie gras with a pleasing expression. "I cut the foie gras for you, Matthew. Give it a try."

"Thank you."

---

The next morning, Isabella took the subway to the company.

She took advantage of the fact that her department colleagues hadn't arrived yet and quietly entered the CEO's office while holding the gift Sebastian had given her.

The office curtains were tightly closed, and it was quiet. Isabella went straight to Sebastian's desk without noticing the man sitting on the sofa to her left.

She placed the bag down and was about to leave immediately when she turned her head and made eye contact with the man on the sofa.

"Mr. Landon!"

What did it feel like to be caught in the act like a thief?

She felt awkward. Sebastian sat back on the black sofa with his shirt collar loose and his legs slightly bent, giving off an extremely tired demeanor. But he looked rather content. He stared at Isabella with interest. "The company has tight security, so how could a thief have gotten in? But when I looked closely, it turned out to be you, Isabella."
###chapter 10 His Favoritism
Sebastian might have just woken up, as his voice had a hint of laziness. When he called Isabella's name, his tone was slightly raised with an indescribable tenderness.

His voice made Isabella blush a little, and she explained, "This is what you gave me. I'm returning it to you."

Sebastian glanced at the bag on the table. "Don't you like it?"

"It's not that," Isabella shook her head, "I can't accept something so valuable. I have no reason to take it."

"It's not that valuable. It's just a small token from me," Sebastian said, "Or you can tell me what you like, and I can have Jack buy it for you. You can choose for yourself."

He sincerely wanted to make it up to her.

"I didn't think much of that night, Mr. Landon. It's in the past, so I'll forget about it. If you give me something, it would only remind me of it." Isabella spoke the truth. That incident had already passed. If neither of them brought it up again, it would be over. But Sebastian gave her something that made it seem like this matter couldn't be resolved.

Sebastian nodded, perhaps thinking that what she said made sense. "Alright. I won't force you to accept it."

"Thank you, Mr. Landon."

Isabella turned to leave, but Sebastian called out to her again. "Could you make me a cup of coffee?"

Since she was part of his assistant department, Isabella could handle a small favor like that. "Alright, please wait a moment."

When she returned to the sofa with the coffee, Sebastian had closed his eyes and seemed to have fallen asleep.

"Mr. Landon?" Isabella called him softly, but he didn't react at all.

Not wanting to disturb him, Isabella bent down to place the cup on the table, but as she was about to pull her hand away, Sebastian suddenly grabbed her wrist.

"Ah!" Isabella exclaimed, losing her grip on the cup and spilling the coffee.

Sebastian confusedly let go of her hand and rubbed his temple. "Sorry..."

He had just dreamt of that night, and Isabella happened to come over. The faint scent on her body had stirred his restlessness, causing him to subconsciously reach out and grab her.

"Are you okay?" Sebastian felt guilty as he looked at Isabella's reddened hand.

She was like a fragile "little white rabbit", and he seemed to unintentionally startle her all the time.

Knowing that he didn't mean to scare her, Isabella hid her hands behind her back. "I'm fine. If there's nothing else, I'll leave."

"Alright."

Sebastian finally let her go.

Isabella hurried out and happened to run into two people.

"Isabella?" Laura widened her eyes in surprise. "Why were you coming out of Mr. Landon's office?"

Vanessa also looked at her with confusion all over her face.

Isabella didn't want to explain and tried to walk away, but Laura grabbed her. "Don't leave! Don't you know interns aren't allowed in the CEO's office? And it's so early; no one else is here yet, but here you are, coming out all flustered. Did you steal something?"

Laura noticed Isabella's left hand hidden behind her back and immediately concluded that she had stolen something. She sternly demanded, "What do you have in your hand? Show me!"

At that moment, Jack and a few others came over from the direction of the elevator. "What's going on? Why are you arguing?"

Laura pointed at Isabella and loudly said, "I just saw Isabella come out of the CEO's office, Mr. Brown. It seems like she stole something!"

Everyone's attention was focused on Isabella.

"I didn't steal anything!" Isabella defended herself.

"Then why have you been hiding your left hand?" Laura looked down on her. She had disliked Isabella for a long time. "Do you dare show everyone what's in your hand?"

Isabella reluctantly revealed her left hand.

Her hand was empty. There was nothing in it, only a red burn mark on the back of her hand.

Laura said, "You hesitated for a long time. You must have hidden something from your person. Will you let us search you?"

Isabella flushed with urgency. "I didn't steal anything, why gives you the right to search me?"

"Because you're suspicious and because you broke the rules by sneaking into the CEO's office! If you won't let us search you, it means you're hiding something!" Laura acted arrogantly, almost pointing her finger at Isabella and telling her to leave.

Vanessa stood by silently.

The others usually had a good relationship with Laura, so they remained bystanders at this moment.

Jack hesitated for a moment, then spoke up, "Isabella, interns aren't allowed in the CEO's office according to company regulations. Did you know that?"

"Yes, I did," Isabella nodded.

She had just wanted to return something to Sebastian, nothing else. She had to quietly return it to him, too.

She couldn't do it in front of everyone.

Otherwise, people would definitely talk about her in private, and they would misunderstand the relationship between her and Sebastian.

Laura seized on that topic to gain attention. "Did everyone hear that? She did this on purpose! She must have stolen something. Maybe our company's competitor sent her here to be a spy. You really should investigate her thoroughly, Mr. Brown!"

Jack couldn't believe Laura's words. 

He was a very good judge of people and didn't think Isabella seemed like a spy. But he had to follow the company's regulations in front of everyone, so he said, "Do you have anything to say, Isabella?"

Isabella hesitated for a moment and shook her head.

She couldn't explain herself.

"Then why did you go into the CEO's office?"

Isabella shook her head again.

"Can anyone prove that you didn't steal anything?" Jack wanted to help her. If she had just violated the regulations, it wouldn't be a big deal, but if she was accused of stealing, it would be serious.

Isabella was very aware of her position in the company. Regular employees could easily be dismissed, let alone an intern like her. And she couldn't count on Sebastian to come and clear things up for her.

She closed her eyes, "No..."

Before she finished speaking, the office door opened, and Sebastian's voice floated out. "I can vouch for her. Is that enough?"

Everyone turned their heads to look at Sebastian.

Isabella also looked up in surprise, gazing at the man walking toward her. She couldn't describe her feelings at that moment. She just felt that all her uneasiness had disappeared in an instant at his appearance.

"Mr. Landon?" Laura was astonished. "Were you in the office?"

Sebastian glanced at her, "I've been in the office all along. I allowed Isabella to enter the office, and I can also prove that she didn't take anything from the company. Is that enough?"

No one dared to speak, and there was silence in the room.

It was rare to see Sebastian defending someone like this.

Laura didn't want to accept it. "You're not being fair, Mr. Landon! Isabella is an intern, and the company's regulations clearly state that interns are not allowed to enter the CEO's office. She violated the rules..."

Vanessa looked at Sebastian, wanting to know how he would handle this. After all, the company's regulations were serious, and if he couldn't handle this, it wouldn't be convincing.

In theory, Isabella couldn't avoid punishment.

"Who says she's an intern?" Sebastian spoke calmly in the silence. "Jack, tell everyone that starting today, Isabella is a regular employee."

Everyone was shocked.

Laura looked at Sebastian in disbelief.
###chapter 11 Give Me Your Hand
Isabella sat at her desk, staring at the screen, her mind in disarray. She couldn't believe what had just happened. This was the first time someone had ever protected her like this, besides Nina,. And that person was a man she had been intimate with. Isabella was deeply moved.

Next to her, Laura was sobbing, and a few female colleagues surrounded her, offering comfort.

"Don't be upset, Laura. Your makeup will be ruined," one colleague said.

"Yeah, Laura, Mr. Landon didn't say anything to you. You're the beautiful and capable. Mr. Landon wouldn't blame you," another added.

Laura looked up and caught sight of Isabella. She glared at her fiercely and said, "So what if I'm beautiful? So what if I'm capable? I still can't compete with some conniving woman!"

Everyone looked at Isabella with a questioning gaze, probably speculating about her relationship with Sebastian.

The office door opened, and Sebastian walked out, Jack following him.

Sebastian glanced at them briefly, and the people surrounding Laura immediately dispersed and returned to their seats.

Laura looked at Sebastian with red eyes. She was beautiful and came from a good family. She was very popular in the department. Her teary eyes were very captivating. She was sure that as long as Sebastian looked at her, he would definitely fall for her.

But Sebastian didn't look at her. Instead, he looked at Isabella in the furthest corner.

"Isabella," Sebastian spoke, and the whole office held their breath to listen.

Isabella stood up, her cautious demeanor making Sebastian feel a pang of sorrow. He usually didn't pay attention to department business, but since the camping trip, some kind of magnetic force had been drawing him toward Isabella.

"Take your notebook and come with me," Sebastian said and walked towards the elevator.

Isabella lowered her head and followed him in front of everyone's gaze.

As the elevator doors closed, the office remained silent.

After a while, someone suddenly asked, "Isabella... where is she from?"

Laura slammed her phone on the table and ran to the restroom to cry.

---

The Maybach drove along on the asphalt road. Isabella glanced at the man sitting next to her uneasily and asked, "Where are we going, Mr. Landon?"

"We are going to discuss a collaboration," Sebastian replied calmly, looking at his phone.

Isabella was puzzled, "Why did you bring me along?"

His department had dozens of people, many of whom were outstanding workers, while she was just an intern. Even though he had verbally confirmed her full-time position in the morning, she was still a novice. However, no matter what, it was not her place to accompany Sebastian on business trips.

Sebastian took his gaze away from his phone. "The Landon Group does not overlook talent and is always eager to train new people."

"But I'm just a novice..." Isabella's voice was low, and she wished she could bury her head in the sand.

"You should be confident." Sebastian glanced at her swollen left hand and spoke in a deep voice. "I'm the boss, so you should believe in my judgment."

They had arranged to discuss the collaboration at a high-end restaurant. Sebastian, Isabella, and Jack arrived first. The other party had not yet arrived.

They went into a private room.

After closing the door, Isabella realized that Jack was missing.

"Come over here." Sebastian had sat on the couch and opened a small box on the table.

Isabella walked over and found that it was a small medical kit. He had probably prepared it in advance.

Sebastian took out some disinfectant and cotton swabs. "Give me your hand."

Isabella froze when she realized what he was about to do. "Mr. Landon, I..."

Sebastian probably thought she was slow and pulled her over, accidentally pressing his fingers onto Isabella's hand.

Isabella gasped in pain, her facial features almost twisted together.

Sebastian let go of her hand and grabbed her wrist, flipping her hand over, only to see a large red and swollen patch on her fair skin, as well as blisters.

Sebastian frowned slightly. "How did your hand get injured like this?"

He dipped a cotton swab into the disinfectant and wiped it onto her hand.

When the cotton swab touched the blister, Isabella shook in pain.

Sebastian stopped. "I need to puncture the blisters on your hand."

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes when she heard that.

Sebastian found a needle in the medical kit. "Bear with me, it might be a little painful."

His voice was unusually gentle, causing Isabella's heart to soften, and she couldn't help but look at him.

Sebastian had a well-defined appearance, as if his facial features had been carefully sculpted by God. At this moment, his jaw was tight, and he seemed more nervous than her. Isabella felt that many women would like a man like him, even if he wasn't wealthy.

Sebastian pierced each blister on her hand one by one. When he looked up, he met her watery eyes. He felt a thudding in his chest. He smiled faintly. "Do I look good?"

Isabella's face turned red, and she looked away only to discover that the blisters on her hands had been pricked. She had been so focused on looking at him that she hadn't noticed the pain.

Sebastian helped her apply some medicine and wrapped her wrist in gauze. "Don't get any water on the wound. Be careful not to let it get infected."

"Thank you, Mr. Landon," Isabella blushed.

---

A moment later, Jack led a group of partners into the room.

All the other people were men, and they seemed a little surprised when they first saw Isabella. When Andy Williams shook hands with Sebastian, he joked, "This is the first time I've seen you bring a female secretary for a business talk, Mr. Landon. You're very sincere."

Isabella felt slightly surprised when she heard that.

The entire meeting lasted for over two hours, and Isabella sat behind Sebastian the whole time, filling her notebook.

"I'm pleased to collaborate with your company, Mr. Landon," Andy stood up and shook hands with Sebastian.

Sebastian replied politely, "The honor is mine. I've booked suites for all of you. You can rest in your rooms for a while. Can we have dinner together tonight, Mr. Williams?"

"Of course, I'd be delighted, Mr. Landon," Andy said, glancing at Isabella. "See you tonight, Ms. Miller."

Isabella nodded politely.

As she watched them leave, Jack let out a sigh of relief. "We made it."

Isabella was taken aback. "Does this mean the collaboration is successful?"

She had overheard that the project's total investment would reach several billion dollars.

"Yes, we've reached a collaboration agreement," Jack beamed with joy and started flattering Sebastian. "Do you know, Isabella, this collaboration project has been delayed for a year. If Mr. Landon himself hadn't come to negotiate with them, we might not have been able to reach an agreement. Mr. Landon is amazing."

Sebastian glanced at him coldly. "You'd better go to the kitchen instead of flattering me. Success or failure will depend on tonight's dinner."

Jack immediately wiped the smile off his face. "Alright, Mr. Landon, I'll go now."

---

After they returned to their suites, Sebastian went to rest in his room.

Isabella, seeing that there was nothing else to do, also went back to her room. As she lay down, her phone rang.

She looked at the name flashing on the screen, pursed her lips and answered the call.
###chapter 12 Mr. Landon is Afraid You'll Lose Out
"Hello, Vanessa?"

"Hello," Vanessa's voice came through the phone, sounding urgent. "Isabella, where are you and Mr. Landon right now?" 

"What's going on?" 

"I have an urgent document here that needs Mr. Landon's signature," Vanessa's tone was very serious. Isabella glanced at the door, "Do you need me to inform Mr. Landon?"

"No," Vanessa replied, "I know Mr. Landon has a major deal to negotiate today, and I don't want to distract him. Send me your address, and I'll come over to deliver the document for Mr. Landon to sign." 

Isabella didn't hesitate as she thought about the billion-dollar deal, and sent her location to Vanessa. 

Afterward, she lay down on the bed and fell asleep. Isabella slept straight through until evening. When she emerged from her room, Sebastian and Jack were preparing to leave. Isabella tidied herself up and caught up with them. 

Sebastian paused and turned to her. "You don't need to come with me."

Isabella looked at him in confusion. 

"A group of men will be dining together tonight, and things might get rowdy after they're drunk," Jack "translated". "Mr. Landon is worried you might be at a disadvantage." 

Touched yet uneasy, Isabella said, "But Mr. Williams told me to see him tonight. Would it be inappropriate if I didn't go?"

Her main concern was still the billion-dollar project. 

"It's fine," Sebastian reassured her. 

He always appeared confident, as if everything was under his control. His words were gentle and calm, yet they brought her peace of mind. 

As they entered the elevator, Jack couldn't help but comment, "I'm surprised someone as innocent as Isabella exists in this world. She was really going to come to dinner just because Mr. Williams told her to see him tonight. She's so easily deceived."

Sebastian glanced at him, "She is responsible. She's afraid of offending Andy and causing losses to the company."

"I know," Jack nodded. "I just think she's too innocent, too naive."

In today's society, human nature was complex. Many young people were cunning, and willing to do anything to climb the ladder, even at the cost of their integrity. Jack had probably encountered many such individuals, and assumed that most people were like that. He felt surprised and somewhat protective of someone as innocent as Isabella and didn't want her to get hurt.

After a moment of silence, Sebastian suddenly turned to Jack as they exited the elevator. "You're right."

Jack was caught off guard by his statement. "Right about what?"

After Sebastian finished speaking, there his lips slightly curled.

Jack could see clearly that Sebastian's smile had a hint of interest.

Andy and his companions were already seated in the private room. When they saw Sebastian coming in, they got up to greet him, except for Andy, who remained seated and glanced behind Sebastian in some disappointment. He said, "Why isn't Ms. Miller with you?"

Jack responded, "Isabella is not feeling well. Mr. Landon cares about his subordinates, so he let her rest in the room."

"She's not feeling well?" Andy chuckled. "She seemed energetic when I saw her this afternoon. Is she really not feeling well, or is she disrespecting me?"

Sebastian pulled out a chair and sat down. "You've misunderstood, Mr. Williams. She's just a junior employee at my company and cannot afford the respect you require."

As he spoke, he filled two glasses with wine. "I'll give you the respect you deserve, Mr. Williams."

Sebastian downed the two glasses of wine.

There was applause around him, but Andy couldn't help but say, "Mr. Landon, since you put it that way, I have nothing to say. I've just never seen you protect a woman like this. I'm curious about what Ms. Miller is to you. People say you're not tempted by women, but now someone who doesn't know any better might think you have a woman hidden somewhere, hahaha!"

"You must be joking, Mr. Williams. Mr. Landon has always been considerate of his subordinates," Jack said.

Andy gave Jack a cold look. "I'm talking to Mr. Landon, Mr. Brown. Why do you always butt in?"

Jack nodded and stopped interrupting.

Sebastian sat there, his fingers playing with the wine glass, his face darkening.

Andy and his companions maintained polite smiles, staying silent.

The atmosphere in the private room was very tense.

At that moment, the door of the private room opened, and a charming voice sounded. "Excuse me."

"Vanessa?" Jack was slightly surprised. "Why are you here?"

"I have an urgent document that needs Mr. Landon's signature," Vanessa said, approaching Sebastian with the document in hand.

All the men in the private room turned their gaze to the woman. Vanessa was wearing a professional suit, a white shirt, and a black pencil skirt. When she bent over slightly, her curvaceous figure was revealed.

Andy squinted his eyes slightly, suddenly becoming interested. "And who is this young lady?"

"This is Vanessa Field from our company," Jack introduced her to the room. "Vanessa, this is Mr. Williams."
Vanessa smiled slightly and nodded at him, saying, "Hello, Mr. Williams."

"You look beautiful, Ms. Field. Are you also one of Mr. Landon's assistants?" Andy smirked and his gaze lingered on Vanessa's waist and hips for quite some time. "You really know how to attract beautiful women, Mr. Landon. Your assistants are all pretty."

Sebastian ignored him. He signed the documents and handed them to Vanessa. "Go back now."

"Yes, Mr. Landon," Vanessa straightened up. As she did, Andy spoke up. "Since Ms. Miller is sick, maybe Ms. Field can join us for a drink."

With his wine glass in hand, he stood up and walked over to Vanessa. "Ms. Field, may I have the honor?"

He offered the wine glass to Vanessa, but she looked toward Sebastian.

Sebastian stood up and gently blocked Andy. "I'll accompany you for a drink, Mr. Williams."

"You're too polite, Mr. Landon. Since we're about to sign the contract, can't your secretary join me for a drink?" Andy smiled.

"What do you mean?" Sebastian looked at him.

"I mean, if Ms. Field drinks with me, we'll sign the contract. Otherwise, it would mean you aren't sincere about this, and there'll be no need to continue our cooperation."

Sebastian sneered. "Do you think business deals only work with women?"

"You're still young, Mr. Landon. You don't understand. These are the conditions for cooperation." Andy chuckled.

"Mr. Williams," Vanessa interjected. She took the wine glass from Andy's hand. "Mr. Landon is just joking with you. Please don't mind him. I'm good at drinking. If you want me to have a drink with you, I'll drink."

Vanessa was an experienced secretary at the company after all, and she managed to stabilize Andy's mood easily.

With the situation changed, the atmosphere in the private room became harmonious again.

They drank for a long time, and Vanessa went to the restroom to vomit.

When she came out of the restroom, Sebastian and Jack were waiting outside.

"Mr. Landon..." Vanessa called out and staggered towards them.

Sebastian reached out to support her and said to Jack, "Take her back to her room."

"Yes, Mr. Landon."

"Don't take me, I'm not going back." Vanessa struggled in Jack's grip. "I'm not drunk, Mr. Landon. I can still drink. Let me go back, I can continue drinking with them..."

When Vanessa broke free, a few buttons on her shirt popped open, revealing her collarbone and more below.
###chapter 13 Taking Responsibility
Sebastian glanced at her unintentionally, his body tensing up. 

In the next second, he pulled Vanessa over, pressing her against the wall, to examine the faint yet visible marks beneath her collarbone.

The marks on Vanessa's body seemed to have been there for a while, the edges gradually fading but not completely gone. 

Sebastian's gaze shifted as he noticed them. 

He stared intensely at Vanessa, his voice suffocating. "How did you get those marks on your body?" 

"Mr. Landon..." Vanessa, startled, nervously tugged at her clothes. Her eyes avoided Sebastian's questioning gaze. 

Sebastian held her wrist while gripping her chin, demanding, "Speak! How did you get these marks?" 

Tears streamed down Vanessa's face, but she forcefully bit her lip and said nothing. 

"Jack!" Sebastian's voice turned cold. "You handle the rest of this."

"Alright," Jack nodded. 

Sebastian pulled Vanessa behind him and entered the elevator with her. 

--

Isabella was having dinner in her suite when she heard the door opening. She turned around. "Mr. Landon? Vanessa?" 

Sebastian ignored her, pulling Vanessa into his room. 

He slammed the door shut, and she heard it being locked. 

Images flashed through Isabella's mind: Sebastian, full of anger, clutching onto Vanessa, whose clothes were disheveled and eyes were teary. They seemed to have been drinking. Had Vanessa done something wrong? 

As soon as that thought crossed her mind, she heard Vanessa's cries from inside the room. 

Isabella put down her things and walked toward the door, pressing her ear against it. She heard Vanessa's voice, "Mr. Landon... Mr. Landon..." 

"Take them off!" Sebastian's voice was filled with anger. 

Vanessa's crying grew louder. 

Suddenly, Isabella felt an inexplicable surge of courage. She raised her hand and knocked on the door forcefully. "Mr. Landon!" 

"Ah!" Vanessa's voice of surprise came from inside the room. "Mr. Landon, please... Mr. Landon..." 

Isabella suddenly stopped knocking on the door and felt wetness on her face. She raised her hand to touch it and realized that she was crying. 

They were both adults, and they had returned drunk. Combined with what she just heard, it was clear what had happened inside the room. 

Unable to restrain her sadness, Isabella's tears continued to fall. 

She stood outside the door for a moment before turning around and leaving the suite.

In the room, Vanessa took off her shirt and only wore a bra on her upper body.

Sebastian stood before her, his gaze sweeping over the various deep and shallow marks on her body. 

Memories of that passionate night rushed through his mind, but when he looked at Vanessa's face, he felt complex emotions.

After a while, he asked in a hoarse voice, "Were you the woman from that night?"

Vanessa clutched her body and sobbed.

She silently admitted it.

Sebastian took his coat from the nearby rack and handed it to Vanessa, "Put your clothes on."

Vanessa took the clothes and draped them over herself, then Sebastian asked, "What do you want?"

Vanessa hesitated for a second, then kneeled on the ground, "Mr. Landon... I was drunk that night, and I know you didn't mean... I'm sorry... I truly didn't have any malicious intentions... I won't speak of this, and I have no demands... Mr. Landon, I only ask that you don't fire me!"

Sebastian looked at her, his expression complicated, "I'll take responsibility for you, but as you know, office relationships are prohibited in the company. Resign on your own, and after that, I'll have Jack pick you up."

Vanessa widened her eyes, "Mr. Landon..."

Was he asking her to be his woman?

"If you don't want to resign, you can continue to stay at the company, but I'll give you compensation."

Sebastian vividly remembered her innocence and tightness that night, as well as the touch of red that had been left on his sleeping bag the next day. He was not an irresponsible person. Since he had found her, he should take responsibility, especially since he hadn't rejected her that night, but rather liked her.

Zoe had grown old, and her greatest wish was for him to get married soon. In the past, he didn't have any plans to do that, but now that this had happened, it made sense to give Vanessa and himself a chance.

"I'm willing!" Vanessa said, "I'm willing to quit my job at the Landon Group for you."

"Alright." Sebastian nodded.

--

Isabella only realized that this place was quite remote after leaving the restaurant. It was more than twenty miles away from the city center, and there were no taxis to be found. Most of the people who came here were here for business.

She had nowhere to go, so she sat by the fountain when she got tired.

"Isabella?" a familiar voice called out.

Isabella turned around and saw Charlie.

A few other men in suits were with him. When they saw Isabella, they stopped in their tracks and visually inspected her up and down.

"Hello, Charlie." Isabella stood up and greeted him.

Charlie asked, "What are you doing here?"

Isabella answered truthfully. "I came with my boss."

Charlie looked at the restaurant and asked uncertainly, "Your boss came here to discuss business?"

"Yes," Isabella replied.

Charlie wanted to ask her more, but Jack came over at that moment. "Why are you here, Isabella? I've been looking for you for a long time."

Isabella's eyes were still red. "I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I came out for a walk, and I'm sorry for worrying you."

"Come back with me. Mr. Landon is waiting for you," Jack said.

"Okay."

Isabella lifted her foot to leave but Charlie stopped her.

"Mr. Brown?" Charlie looked at Jack, then at Isabella, and finally understood. "Your sister said you found a job. Are you working at the Landon Group?"

Isabella hadn't told Charlie or Nina about her job at the Landon Group. She knew Charlie's personality and was afraid that he would brag about her.

She obviously couldn't avoid it right now and could only respond quietly.

Charlie immediately became excited. "Isabella, you're amazing! It's such a big deal that you're working at the Landon Group. Why didn't you tell me and your sister?"

"I was planning to tell you after the internship period..." Isabella tried to explain.

"Your boss bringing you here to discuss work shows that he values you. You'll definitely be promoted eventually! This is a huge thing, Isabella. I'll tell your sister when I go back tonight. She'll be thrilled," Charlie said, looking at Jack. "It's nice to meet you, Mr. Brown. I'm Charlie from the W.S. Group, and I'm Isabella's brother-in-law."

Jack looked at the business card Charlie handed him and frowned.

Isabella felt her face turning red with embarrassment.

After they entered the elevator, Jack asked, "Was that really your brother-in-law?"

"Yes," Isabella nodded.

Jack continued, "I haven't interacted with him, but I've heard other people talk about him. He harbors evil intentions."

Isabella already knew that, even if Jack hadn't said it.

Jack usually didn't talk much or speak nonsense. He must have had a reason for mentioning this.

"Mr. Brown, if you have something to say, you can just say it," Isabella said.
###chapter 14 How Will You Compensate Me?
"Mr. Landon..." Sebastian carried Vanessa and walked into the elevator. "Go to the hospital."

"Yes," Jack didn't ask further questions and quickly pressed the button to go down.

Jack went to get the car, while Isabella and Sebastian waited in the same spot. He was still holding Vanessa in his arms. As the night wind blew, Vanessa shivered from the cold, and Isabella could see Sebastian tightening his grip on her arm.

When the car arrived, Isabella opened the back door and let Sebastian and Vanessa get in. Sebastian intended for Vanessa and Isabella to sit in the back, but as soon as he put Vanessa down, she woke up, opening her swollen eyes and tightly gripping his shirt.

When Isabella saw that, she instinctively opened the front passenger door and got in.

On the way to the hospital, Isabella looked at the passing street out the window, her thoughts in disarray.

When they arrived at the hospital, Sebastian briskly carried Vanessa inside, and Isabella hurriedly followed behind.

After the doctor's diagnosis, it turned out that Vanessa was allergic to alcohol. After some turmoil, she received an IV drip and fell into a deep sleep.

After a while, Jack arrived and, after understanding Vanessa's condition, said to Sebastian, "Mr. Williams was really angry. Shouldn't we go back and apologize?"

Sebastian narrowed his eyes, clearly reluctant to go back, but for the sake of cooperation and interests, he turned to Isabella and said, "Are you free tonight?"

Isabella nodded.
 
"I'm worried about leaving her alone here. Can you help look after her?" Although Sebastian was her boss, he pleaded so sincerely, that Isabella couldn't refuse.

"Sure," Isabella replied softly.

Sebastian then left with Jack.

Vanessa still needed someone to look after her due to the IV drip, so Isabella sat beside her. Although it was late at night, she wasn't at all sleepy. Her mind felt empty, as if it was filled with too many things, yet also with nothing at all.

In the middle of the night, Vanessa woke up and called out to Isabella in a hoarse voice. "Isabella."

Isabella got up and walked over. "You're awake."

Vanessa looked around. "Am I in the hospital?"

"Yes."

She looked at Isabella again. "Where's Mr. Landon?"

"Mr. Landon and Mr. Brown went back to the restaurant. Do you want some water?"

Vanessa shook her head weakly. She seemed a bit pale after sobering up. She suddenly held Isabella's hand and said, "Isabella, you won't tell anyone about what happened today, right?"

Isabella avoided her gaze for a moment. "What are you talking about?"

"I'm talking about me and Mr. Landon." Vanessa didn't shy away. "You must have heard the sounds from his room tonight, right?"

Isabella's voice was bitter. "You and Mr. Landon..."

"I've been with Mr. Landon for a year," Vanessa continued. "We've been together since not long after I joined the company. But because the company has rules that strictly prohibit office romances, we've always had to be secretive. I didn't expect that you would discover us..."

Isabella was shocked and uneasy when she heard that. If he already had a girlfriend, why did he touch her that night? Could it be that he had mistaken her for Vanessa?

Isabella felt even more distressed.

"Isabella," Vanessa pleaded, "He wanted me to quit and be together with him. But I liked this job and didn't want to resign, so we continued to be together secretly until today. Now I've figured it out, and I plan to quit. However, I don't want too many people to know about this for fear of affecting him. Isabella, you need to help us keep it a secret, okay?"

Isabella remained silent for a moment and nodded. "Don't worry, I won't say anything."

Vanessa smiled. "Thank you, Isabella."

Isabella could hardly sleep that night.

During the first half of the night, she took care of Vanessa's IV drip, and in the second half of the night, every time she closed her eyes, she dreamed of the intense encounter in the tent.

She tossed and turned the whole night, her emotions almost growing out of control.

When it was almost dawn, Isabella heard footsteps. She opened her eyes and she met Sebastian's gaze.

"You didn't sleep?" Sebastian sat down next to her when he saw her awake and casually placed the bag he brought on the table. "I brought you breakfast. Thank you."

Isabella sat up. "Since you're here, I'll go back." 

"Isabella," Sebastian called her. "Take the breakfast with you."

Isabella shook her head. "No, thank you. You can leave it for Vanessa," she said. After speaking, she opened the door and walked out. As the door closed, shutting out the outside light, the dim lighting inside made Sebastian's eyes uncomfortable, or perhaps he was hungover. He raised his hand and rubbed his forehead, feeling a bit annoyed.

--

It was still early, so Isabella returned to her school dormitory, took a shower, changed clothes, and went to the company. Sebastian and Vanessa didn't show up at the office today. 

Around noon, Isabella heard Laura calling Vanessa on the phone. "You're at the hospital? Are you sick?" Isabella didn't know what Vanessa said, but Laura said, "Which hospital are you at? I want to come see you." After a moment, she added, "Oh... okay. Rest well, and let me know if anything comes up." 

Laura hung up, turned around, and saw Isabella, who was lost in thought, holding a cup. Laura arrogantly walked over bumped right into Isabella instead of avoiding her.

"Ahh!"

Hot water spilled onto Isabella, but Laura cried out in alarm. Before Isabella could react, Laura raised her hand and slapped her. Isabella didn't have time to respond. 

"Don't you look where you walk? Do you know how expensive this outfit is? It's limited edition and can't get wet, do you understand?" 

Laura was the first to complain and pointed at Isabella, cursing at her loudly. Her voice attracted a lot of coworkers' attention. Isabella was both angry and anxious and tried to refute, "You clearly bumped into me..."

Her voice was weak and was instantly drowned out by Laura's loud voice. "Speak up, how will you compensate me?" 

Isabella fell silent. "Why are you causing a scene again, Laura?" Jack walked over with a folder in his hand. "I could hear you yelling from far away. I warn you, Mr. Landon is in a bad mood these days. You better not provoke him." 

However, Laura wasn't afraid. "So what if I anger him? Mr. Landon would rather promote an intern than give opportunities to senior employees. I don't want to work in this department anymore!" 

"Laura!" Jack's voice became stern. "If you don't want to stay here, you can quit." Laura had just been venting her anger, so she immediately fell silent. 

Jack continued, "If you want to keep working here, behave yourself! Don't bring your bad mood to the company and affect everyone!" 

Laura bit her lip and didn't dare argue with Jack. She targeted Isabella instead. "This dress cost $7,800, Isabella. You need to compensate me for that!"

Jack glanced at Isabella and said, "Enough, Laura. Isabella's dress has been ruined, so your losses are the same."

"What? Are you joking, Mr. Brown? My dress cost $7,800. I bet hers doesn't cost more than $780! Our losses are not the same! Fine, I can compensate her for her dress, but she needs to compensate me for mine!"

As soon as Laura finished speaking, Isabella responded, "I won't compensate you."

Laura froze for a second.
###chapter 15 Isabella Will Do No Such a Thing
"What did you say?" Laura stared at Isabella, "Aren't you going to take responsibility?"

Isabella glanced at her dress, "It's not that I don't want to take responsibility. Firstly, I was standing here, and you bumped into me, so I'm not at fault. Secondly, even if I were at fault, I wouldn't give you $7,800!"

Laura couldn't believe that the usually timid Isabella was defying her. Along with her shock, she felt more and more annoyed, "I was walking from here. You were blocking the way and didn't me space, otherwise I wouldn't have bumped into you. Anyway, my dress is worth $7,800, and you need to compensate me in full, or you'll face the consequences!"

Laura thought Isabella was timid and weak, and that scaring her a little would make her submit.

But Isabella said, "Your dress isn't worth $7,800!"

Laura widened her eyes. "You're talking nonsense! This dress is from an international brand, it's not cheap. It doesn't matter if you don't recognize it, but please don't speak if you don't know anything!"

"I'm not talking nonsense. Your dress is fake." Isabella's tone remained calm, but her words were shocking.

Laura's face changed, "You're talking nonsense! This dress is not fake, it's authentic! You just don't want to compensate me, Isabella so you're making up an excuse."

Isabella looked around. Their colleagues were watching, but it was clear that most people believed Laura's words.

Finally, Jack spoke up. "Show Isabella the receipt, Laura."

"I didn't buy this dress, a friend gave it to me. How would I have the receipt?" Laura rolled her eyes and expressed her dissatisfaction. "Are you taking her side, Mr. Brown?"

Jack was the assistant to the CEO and the highest-ranking executive in the department apart from Sebastian. He couldn't be biased toward anyone.

Isabella didn't want to put him in a difficult position either, so she said to Laura, "We can find an expert to verify whether your dress is fake or not."

"Fine, I agree!"

The Landon Group had a clothing brand department, so it wasn't difficult to find someone to come assess the dress. Jack made a phone call, and soon, someone from the brand department came up.

The assessment process was simple. She took a quick look at the sewn-in label and tag, checked two details, and then gave her conclusion. "Where did you buy this dress, Ms. Jones?"

"It was a gift from a friend," Laura casually replied. "Just tell them if there's anything wrong with my dress."

"Ms. Jones, this dress is a knockoff. It's not authentic."

"What?!" Laura exploded in anger. "You must be mistaken! Did you examine it carefully?"

Jack scolded her softly, "Laura, that's enough. Are you questioning the director of the company's brand department?"

Laura fell silent for a moment.

The clothing department dealt with major brands all day long and was very professional. There was no way she would make a mistake in identifying the authenticity of a dress. But Laura still looked like she didn't believe it and was furious, saying, "How dare she give me a fake!"

Isabella wasn't concerned about that. She asked the director of the brand department, "May I ask how much this dress would typically sell for?"

After some thought, she replied, "Ordinary knockoffs can sell for thousands of dollars. The craftsmanship and fabric of this dress are pretty good, so the market price would be around two thousand dollars."

"You still owe me, even if it's two thousand dollars!" Laura fumed, feeling humiliated. She knew Isabella was from a financially struggling family, was still in college, and had just recently become a full-fledged employee. Two thousand dollars was not a small sum for Isabella.

Isabella knew that it was useless to say anything to her, so she turned to Jack and said, "I'd like to see the surveillance footage of the water cooler, Mr. Brown."

Laura's expression changed. "What do you mean?"

Ignoring her, Isabella looked at Jack and asked once more, "May I see the surveillance footage of the water cooler, Mr. Brown?"

Jack glanced at Laura. Laura was afraid the truth would be exposed, but she couldn't say anything in front of everyone, so she had to agree. "You can watch the surveillance footage, I don't mind."

Jack's phone was connected to the surveillance system, but he didn't have permission to view the footage. Only Sebastian had the authorization.

Jack called Sebastian, who asked what was going on.

Jack didn't hide anything from him and briefly explained the situation.

'Isabella wouldn't do that,' was Sebastian's immediate thought after listening to Jack's words. He was almost surprised by his own reaction. After a pause, he added, "I'll grant you access, Jack. You need to prove Isabella's innocence."

"Yes, Mr. Landon," Jack said, hanging up the phone and pondering for a while.

Was Sebastian so concerned about the affairs of his subordinates now? If he had called Sebastian in the past to ask for monitoring privileges, Sebastian would have scolded him.

Jack was always thorough in his work. Since that this was a private matter between Laura and Isabella, he called them into a small reception room. He closed the curtains, keeping prying eyes outside.

"Why do we have to come in here to talk about something that could be discussed outside?" Laura flicked her golden curls, looking disdainful. "I haven't done anything wrong. I'm not afraid to face everyone."

Jack glanced at her. "Don't be so confident, Laura. I'm doing this to save your reputation, you know."

Laura frowned, unwilling to accept that, but she didn't say anything more.

"I've retrieved the surveillance footage. You can take a look." Jack pushed the tablet toward them.

The company's surveillance was in high definition. They could even see the patterns on Laura's cup, let alone her deliberate bump into Isabella.

Laura probably hadn't expected the surveillance video to be so clear, and she fell silent.

"Have you finished watching?" Jack took the tablet back. "Do you have anything to say, Laura?"

"I have nothing to say. Maybe I was just too tired and accidentally bumped into her while passing by. After all, my clothes and shoes are more expensive than hers. If I intentionally bumped into her, I would be the one at a loss."

Isabella listened to her excuse expressionlessly.

Jack asked, "Isabella, do you have anything to say?"

Laura interrupted him. "Why does she have to say anything? It's just a set of clothes. I'll compensate her with money."

"I don't want money, and I don't need her to compensate me." Isabella shook her head. "I just want an apology."

"Are you crazy, Isabella? You want me to apologize to you?" Laura pointed at herself. "What are you thinking? Don't be absurd."

Laura was usually the most popular person in the department, but she was now being asked to apologize to an intern she despised. Of course she wouldn't do it.

"You say you don't want compensation, but you actually want more! I can compensate you with ten sets of clothes, it won't cost much anyway," Laura said, taking out her phone and saying, "I'll transfer the money to you right now. It'll be enough for ten sets of clothes as compensation!"
###chapter 16 Unable to be Cruel to Isabella
Isabella said, "I don't want any compensation, I just want you to apologize in front of everyone."

This had been Laura's fault, and now there was surveillance footage proving it, so she couldn't escape responsibility.

"Mr. Brown!" Laura coquettishly called out to Jack.

But Jack didn't even look at her. "Laura, if you formally apologize to Isabella, this matter will be resolved."

Laura had no way out when she saw that Jack wasn't helping her.

Jack opened the door to the small waiting room and led them out. "Everyone, pause your work for a moment. I've investigated the incident that just happened. Laura accidentally bumped into Isabella when she passed by. Now the matter has been resolved, and Laura needs to apologize to Isabella in front of everyone. I hope you can all bear witness to this, and once the matter is over, it should not be brought up again."

Everyone looked toward Laura and Isabella, surprised at how quickly the situation had turned around.

Finally, Laura apologized to Isabella in front of everyone. But their conflict deepened.

However, Isabella didn't care about that. She had been used to being alone since she was young. When she met Samantha in college, it took her a while to adapt to being around her. Then, Samantha got together with Matthew, and Isabella became alone again.

Perhaps it was because Isabella had been deeply hurt by Samantha that she now had a guarded mentality. After all, it's hard to discern between good and bad people.

Sebastian frowned at his phone screen in the hospital, looking at Isabella.

While handling this, Jack had taken a look at the surveillance footage of the water cooler, including Laura's public apology to Isabella. It was clear that Isabella hadn't done anything wrong, yet Laura was so arrogant. 

Right now, Laura was surrounded by a few girls who were talking to her, while Isabella sat quietly in the corner, like a wounded little animal, licking her wounds alone.

Sebastian considered himself not a sympathetic person, but he couldn't be cruel to Isabella.

"Sebastian." Vanessa's voice pulled him back to reality.

Sebastian looked up with an unclear expression as he looked at Vanessa. "What did you call me?"

"Sebastian... can I call you that?" Vanessa asked cautiously, then explained, "I just think that if we're going to have a normal relationship, I should call you that. If you don't like it, I can still call you Mr. Landon."

Sebastian remained silent for a few seconds. "Just continue calling me what you did before. I'm not used to it."

"Okay..." Vanessa lowered her gaze, disappointment evident on her face.

Sebastian put away his phone and stood up. "What's wrong?"

"I... Vanessa glanced at the glass on the table. "I'd like to have some water. Could you please get me some?"

In the past, she would never dare speak like this. But things were different now. Her relationship with Sebastian had changed...

Vanessa looked at Sebastian expectantly.

Sebastian didn't expect her to adapt to the role so quickly, and after a brief moment of astonishment, poured her a glass of water.

After she finished drinking, Sebastian spoke. "I need to go back to the office. Do you need me to find you a caretaker?"

"No, it was just an alcohol allergy, it's not a big deal. I'll be fine."

"Alright."

---

Vanessa didn't come to the office for several days.

Sebastian was busy with work, and Isabella rarely saw him.

On the fourth day, Vanessa finally showed up.

Laura was the first to approach Vanessa and hug her. "Goodness, what illness did you have? It must have been serious, considering you took four days off."

Vanessa mumbled a vague response.

Laura then noticed that she was dressed differently today. "Why did you come dressed like this?"

The company required employees to wear formal attire. Normally, Vanessa followed the dress code strictly, but today, she was wearing a navy blue dress, heavy makeup, and jewelry, which made her look like a completely different person.

Vanessa smiled. "I'm here to resign today."

"What?!" Everyone was shocked.

Laura held Vanessa's hand and asked her many questions.

Vanessa casually gave some evasive answers.

Laura still didn't believe it. "Are you kidding?"

"I'm not. I've already completed the resignation process. We've worked together for many years, so I'll treat everyone to dinner tonight. I'll send the details to our group chat."

Vanessa then walked up to Isabella's desk. "Isabella, are you free tonight? Let's have dinner together."

Laura and a few others looked at Isabella in an unfriendly way.

Isabella declined. "No, thanks. I have other plans tonight."
Vanessa persisted in wanting Isabella to join them, saying, "Come with us, I'm about to leave the company, can't you just have a meal with me? Mr. Landon will be there too."

Isabella reluctantly agreed.

"Mr. Landon is going too? Really?" Laura asked excitedly, surrounding Vanessa.

"Mr. Landon rarely comes to our gatherings. Did you already invite him to dinner, Vanessa? Did Mr. Landon say he would go?"

"Yeah, it's hard to invite Mr. Landon anywhere. He didn't even go to Mr. Brown's birthday party."

Vanessa smiled slightly. "I already talked to Mr. Landon about it."

"Wow, Vanessa, you're amazing."

"Mr. Landon actually agreed to your invitation, Vanessa. You're almost on the same level as Mr. Brown. Are you going to regret quitting?"

"Of course." Vanessa smiled. "But we always have to give up something in life. No matter how hard women work, when they reach a certain age, it's useless. We need to get married and have children."

"So you're going to get married and leave?" Laura asked.

"But as far as I know, you don't even have a boyfriend. Why are you suddenly getting married?"

"I do have a boyfriend, but our relationship wasn't stable before. Now he wants to stabilize our relationship, so all I can do is agree." Vanessa had a happy expression on her face, and her eyes were filled with happiness.

Everyone congratulated her again.

The office was too noisy, and Isabella found it was too loud. She stood up and went to the bathroom.

Isabella sat in the cubicle, and not long after, she heard footsteps outside.

Then the sound of the door closing.

Laura's voice came next. "Vanessa, were you telling the truth? Do you have a boyfriend? Are you quitting to get married?"

"Yes, I was telling the truth." Vanessa nodded, honestly admitting it.

"You're so mean. I told you all my secrets, but you didn't tell me when you got a boyfriend." Laura complained, but couldn't hide her curiosity and excitement. "Tell me, who is your boyfriend? Is it Mr. Smith, whom you met on the project last year, or Mr. Johnson, whom you had dinner with last month?"

"It's not either of them..."

"Then who is he?"

"I can't tell you now, but you'll find out later..."

Everyone knew that Vanessa would never say anything she didn't want to. Laura had to stop probing when she saw that she wasn't spilling the beans. "So when are you going to have the wedding?"

"Soon, if everything goes well. We'll be able to have the wedding at the end of this year."
###chapter 17 Have You Seen Enough?
Isabella listened to those words, thinking about Vanessa and Sebastian's wedding and feeling upset. She planned to go out after they left, but at that moment, her phone suddenly rang...

The sudden ringing of her phone startled Isabella, as well as Laura and Vanessa outside. They had purposely gone to the restroom to have a private conversation and hadn't expected someone else to be inside.

Her temper flaring, Laura immediately pounded on the door and asked, "Who's in there?"

Isabella walked out of the small cubicle.

"Isabella?" Laura exclaimed excitedly when she saw her. "Why were you hiding in the restroom eavesdropping on our conversation?"

"You misunderstood, I just happened to be here using the toilet," Isabella replied as she walked toward the sink.

Laura reached out and grabbed her. "Isabella, I don't care about your relationship with Mr. Landon, but I'd advise you to be honest with me. I have plenty of ways to deal with you and kick you out of the Landon Group!"

"Laura." Vanessa held onto Laura. "Let it go. I believe Isabella didn't eavesdrop on us intentionally."

With Vanessa's help, Isabella managed to get away.

As Isabella left, Laura stomped her foot in anger. "Why do you always take Isabella's side, Vanessa?"

"I just don't want you to offend anyone." Vanessa smiled faintly and glanced at Isabella's back. In her heart, she thought, "After all, Isabella has helped me a lot. Shouldn't I help her instead of helping you?"

---

After work, Isabella planned to go back, but when she arrived at the company's entrance, Sebastian's car pulled up.

The car window rolled down. Both Sebastian and Vanessa were inside.

"Get in the car and come with us, Isabella." Vanessa invited her to join them.

However, Isabella shook her head. "No, thank you."

"Oh. Are you going to take a taxi by yourself?" Vanessa asked. "The restaurant is far away from here. It would cost more than twenty dollars to take a taxi."

Isabella was usually frugal, and she hesitated to spend more than twenty dollars on a meal, let alone a taxi.

In fact, she hadn't planned on attending this farewell party. After all, she was always overlooked at the company, so even if she didn't go, nobody would notice. That was why she had purposely waited until everyone had left before slowly going downstairs, but she hadn't expected to run into Sebastian and Vanessa as soon as she came down.

She glanced at her phone and said, "I've called a cab already, you guys go ahead."

"Alright," Vanessa nodded. "We'll go first, see you later."

"Alright, see you later."

As Isabella watched Sebastian's car drive away, she knew that she really had to go, so she picked up her phone and called a cab.

This was the peak travel period, and if she took a cab by herself, it would cost her twenty dollars, but if she shared a ride with someone else, she would only have to pay half the cost. Isabella thought for a moment and decided to share a ride.

She waited for about ten minutes before the taxi arrived.

Isabella opened the back seat door but was startled.

There were already two people sitting in the back seat, a man and a woman. They were passionately embracing each other, their mouths almost sticking together. Isabella could even hear the sound of saliva. 

The man's hand was inside the woman's clothes, moving provocatively in front of her chest.

This scene was too much for Isabella. She had never seen anything like it before, and she froze on the spot.

The man turned his head to look at her, his dissatisfied eyes scanning Isabella's face. "Have you seen enough?"

Isabella snapped back to reality, apologizing repeatedly and hastily closing the car door.

The driver stuck his head out from the front. "Hey, are you getting in?"

Isabella thought about what she had just seen, trying to decide whether to call another cab, when Vanessa called her.

Vanessa asked when she would arrive and said she was waiting for her to come and cut the cake.

Isabella had no choice but to get in the cab and sit in the passenger seat.

The noises from the back continued, but the driver seemed oblivious and was focused on driving. Isabella really wanted to give him a thumbs up. She unintentionally glanced up and met the deep gaze of the man in the back seat through the rearview mirror.

Isabella awkwardly looked away quickly and stared out the window.

Ten minutes later, they arrived at their destination.

Isabella paid the fare and quickly got out of the car, running into the restaurant without looking back.

She didn't notice that a man's gaze was following her from behind...

--

When Isabella arrived, Vanessa was surrounded by a group of people in the middle, cutting the cake.

The cake was quickly distributed. When Vanessa finally saw Isabella, she handed her own portion to her. "Isabella, you can have mine."

Vanessa's words drew all the attention in the private room toward Isabella.

Isabella shook her head and took an orange from the table. "I'll just have some fruit."

However, Vanessa insisted on giving her the cake and then went to sing with Laura.

Isabella held the cake in her hands, looked around, and found a corner to sit down.

As soon as she sat down, the door to the private room opened and a man walked in.

Isabella glanced at the man and almost choked on her cake. It was the man she had been in the car with earlier! Why was he here? Had he mistakenly come to the wrong room?

"Darling, you're here." Laura, who was wearing a red dress, walked past everyone and went straight to the man, stopping next to him and reaching out to hold his arm.

The man looked at her with a teasing smile. "You called me, so of course I had to come."

Laura's colleagues saw how close they were and started asking questions.

With him by her side, Laura proudly said, "Let me introduce you all. This is my boyfriend, Leo Anderson."

As soon as she finished introducing him, the room erupted in excitement.

"Oh my god! Laura, your boyfriend is so handsome!"

"What's going on with you and Vanessa? She suddenly quit to get married, and now you've suddenly brought your boyfriend here. Are you trying to tease us?"

"Congratulations!"

"It looks like we'll be attending another wedding this year."

Laura listened to their congratulations with satisfaction, feeling very happy.

But Isabella, sitting in the corner, was still in shock. She remembered everything she had seen in the car, and she couldn't find anything funny about it. Did Laura know that her boyfriend had been kissing another woman just a second ago?

Isabella had a strong aversion to infidelity in relationships, which was why she had completely cut off all ties with Samantha and Matthew after finding out they betrayed her. She couldn't accept a betrayal like that, let alone tolerate a relationship that had started with cheating.

She didn't want to meddle in someone else's affairs, but seeing Laura holding Leo's arm made her feel somewhat uncomfortable.

As Isabella was about to shift her gaze away, Leo looked at her.

Their eyes met in the air, and Leo actually smiled at her.

Following that, Laura gave her a sharp look.

Isabella felt very embarrassed.

Right then, Sebastian and Jack came in from outside.

The people in the room stood up one after another, "Mr. Landon."

Maybe to avoid suspicion, Vanessa came up first, and Sebastian deliberately appeared last.
###chapter 18 Truth or Dare
This was Sebastian's first time at an employee farewell party. Isabella sat in the corner eating cake, listening to a few girls next to her who were gossiping.

"I never realized Mr. Landon cared so much about Vanessa. In the past, some colleagues invited us to dinner when they left, and Mr. Landon always refused. But he accepted Vanessa's invitation."

"Yeah, I thought it was weird too. Vanessa isn't usually highly regarded."

"Did you guys notice that Vanessa's gaze keeps flickering toward Mr. Landon? I feel like they have a secret relationship."

"Really? Vanessa is decent-looking, but not particularly beautiful. She and Mr. Landon are completely mismatched."

"I agree. Mr. Landon is so outstanding that he can have any type of woman he wants. He couldn't possibly be interested in Vanessa."

"What do you think, Isabella?"

Isabella was listening quietly as they gossiped, but they suddenly threw the topic at her. Several girls looked at her, hoping she would speculate as well.

Isabella looked at them awkwardly, thinking about how to respond.

Before she could answer, Vanessa suddenly called her name. "Isabella!"

Vanessa came over and pulled Isabella up from her seat. "Isabella, we're playing Truth or Dare and we need a few more people. Come play with us."

Although Vanessa seemed to be asking her, she didn't give her a chance to refuse and dragged her to the table.

"I don't want to..." Isabella wanted to run away.

Vanessa pushed her back down. "It's precisely because you don't want to play that you should. You shouldn't always be shrinking in the corner, Isabella. You need to learn to be united and get along with everyone."

Isabella remained silent.

Last time during the camping trip, Vanessa had persuaded her to drink, and as a result, she had drunk too much, stumbled into the wrong tent, and slept with the wrong person...

Isabella had learned her lesson and didn't want to make that mistake again. But at this moment, someone pulled her chair away and Sebastian sat down.

Everyone was shocked.

Even Vanessa was slightly surprised, then smiled and said, "Look, Isabella, Mr. Landon is joining us too. Just play with us."

Isabella couldn't refuse anymore.

Vanessa knew her weaknesses and knew that she didn't dare offend the boss.

"Alright, let's take our seats." Vanessa pulled out the chair on the other side of Isabella. Sebastian and Vanessa sandwiched her in the middle.

Isabella felt even more awkward.

She felt like she was the third wheel.

Besides them, the other people participating in Truth or Dare were Laura and Leo, two female colleagues, and two male colleagues. Originally, the male and female ratios had been balanced, but with the addition of Isabella, the balance was instantly broken.

After playing two rounds, Isabella had a basic understanding of the rules of the game. The person who was chosen had to choose between Truth or Dare. If they chose Truth, they had to answer other people's questions, and if they didn't want to answer, they had to drink. If they chose Dare, they had to perform a task as directed by someone else, and if they didn't want to do it, they also had to drink.

In short, they played this game for fun.

In the first two rounds, a male colleague and a female colleague were chosen respectively.

The female colleague chose Truth, and the male colleague chose Dare.

The question the female colleague had to answer was, "How many times have you been in a relationship?"

She blushed and replied, "Once."

The male colleague was asked to sing a song on the spot, and he confidently sang a song, although slightly off key, but with great enthusiasm.

After he finished singing, everyone applauded. Isabella joined in the applause.

"You guys are playing a boring game," a discordant voice rang out, mixed with a hint of mockery.

Everyone turned their heads and looked at Laura's boyfriend, Leo.

Leo looked bored. "This is the first time I've seen someone play Truth or Dare like this. It's even more boring than chess."

Everyone was stunned for a moment.

Laura nudged him lightly with her elbow, "These are my colleagues, of course they're different from your friends."

Leo smirked and didn't say anything.

The game continued, and no one paid much attention to his words.

This time, Leo drew a Trump card, which meant he could give instructions and ask questions to others.

The person who drew "Truth" happened to be Laura.

Laura looked at him sweetly. "I choose Truth, ask me anything."

Leo chuckled, lightly tapped his fingers on the table, and asked, "How many times have you done it?"

Laura's smile immediately disappeared.

There was a dead silence.

No one could believe that Leo would ask such a question in public!

Isabella silently bowed her head, recalling Leo kissing another woman when she opened the car door... It might have been because she had seen more thrilling things, but Isabella's reaction was relatively calm.

Sebastian frowned. "Why would you ask such a question?"

Leo raised an eyebrow, looked around, and put his arm around Laura's waist, speaking in a casual tone. "Laura, if you don't dare answer, you have to drink."

Laura looked at him, she had almost bitten through her red lips. "Of course I dare! I'll answer! Three times."

"Oh." Leo shrugged nonchalantly and continued, "I mean, how many times have you had an abortion?"

Laura was taken aback, her face immediately turned pale. It was a terrible situation.

Laura was used to being arrogant when she was at the department, so she should have slapped Leo angrily since he was humiliating her. But strangely, although Laura was angry, she didn't hit him, but sternly asked with a cold face, "What do you mean, Leo?"

Leo smiled slightly, "I don't mean anything. We're just playing this game for fun, right?"

Laura couldn't say anything. Isabella and the others also fell into an awkward silence.

This was no longer just for fun, it was too much. It was even more exciting than watching a horror movie!

When Leo saw Laura's silence, he handed her a drink. "Have a drink."

This time, Laura chose to drink.

Isabella felt that if Sebastian hadn't been present, maybe Laura would have walked out on the spot. But after drinking, she still sat down and said, "Continue!"

A new round of the game began. Isabella drew "Truth", and she couldn't help but panic. Her first reaction was to look at Leo, hoping that he wouldn't have the trump card this time.

Leo made eye contact with Isabella as if he could see through her thoughts and flipped over the card in his hand.

Isabella's heart instantly sank.

She was really unlucky. Leo had the trump card again.

Isabella saw him smile at her. It was a smile tinged with malice. "Show your cards."

Everyone displayed their cards one by one.

The person who had drawn "Dare" was Vanessa.

Leo said to Vanessa, "Find a man in the room and kiss him."

Once again, everyone was shocked.

Sure enough, none of the tasks Leo proposed were normal.

Vanessa looked at Sebastian then picked up her drink, "I'll drink."

Vanessa downed a full glass of alcohol, her eyes turning red. Isabella was a little afraid, and her hand under the table involuntarily clenched the playing cards.

Suddenly, Sebastian lightly touched her hand, and Isabella lowered her gaze, surprised to see him handing his own card over to her.
###chapter 19 Mr. Landon, Do You Dare Play?
If she exchanged cards with him, she could avoid Leo's challenges, but what about Sebastian?

Isabella tightened her grip on the cards in her hand, her thoughts in chaos.

"Isabella?" Vanessa suddenly tapped her shoulder, "It's your turn to show your card."

Isabella took a deep breath and displayed the card in her hand.

"Ha, Truth?" Laura saw Isabella's card and was immediately delighted. If even she couldn't handle Leo's questions, how could Isabella? Isabella would definitely be more embarrassed than her.

Other people looked at Isabella with sympathetic eyes, which made her even more nervous. Vanessa glanced at Sebastian and said to Leo, "Isabella is the shyest and youngest in our company. Don't be too hard on her."

"Shy?" Leo responded with a half-smile, raising his eyes to look at Isabella, feeling skeptical. After all, she never took her eyes off them when he was intimate with that woman.

Isabella knew she couldn't escape anymore. Since she had agreed to play, she had to accept the challenge. But she didn't want to give anyone else a chance to humiliate her, so she reached out and picked up a glass of wine, drinking it all in one gulp.

"Isabella!" Vanessa exclaimed, reaching out to stop her, but it was too late. Isabella had already finished the entire glass of wine.

"I choose to drink," Isabella said, placing the glass down, feeling a bit dizzy.

Vanessa was surprised. "That was liquor, Isabella. You should have drunk it slowly."

What?

Isabella was also startled.

She rubbed her temples with her hand. No wonder the wine tasted so spicy. She was feeling a bit dizzy after just one glass.

As she spoke, her face turned red.

Leo opposite them was holding the cards between his fingertips. "Why aren't you playing by the rules, Ms. Miller? If everyone chooses to drink to evade the rules, what's the point of the game?"

"She's just timid," Vanessa said.

"Even if she's timid, she can't break the rules," Laura quickly added. "This is the last chance. If anyone breaks the rules again, they'll have to drink three glasses of wine as punishment."

"Okay," Vanessa agreed promptly.

Isabella felt dizzy. She hadn't even had a chance to quit the game before the next round of cards was dealt.

Looking at the cards in her hand, Isabella shook her head, thinking that she must have misread them.

The card she had received was "Truth" again.

"It seems you can't escape it, Ms. Miller," Leo said, smirking as he looked at the card in her hand. He flipped it over, and it turned out to be another trump card.

It might have been because she had drunk some wine, but Isabella was not as scared this time. She turned over the card and said, "Ask your question."

The atmosphere at the table suddenly became tense. Everyone's gaze fell on Leo, wondering what explosive question he would throw at her.

Leo tapped his fingers twice on the table, smirked, and asked, "Everyone says you're shy, so I want to ask, Ms. Miller, when was your first time?"

Silence filled the table.

Isabella felt her head buzz, her thoughts pulling her back to that passionate night...

Laura smiled satisfactorily, looking at Isabella with a gleeful expression.

Vanessa was full of worry. Although she was looking at Isabella, her attention was all on Sebastian next to her.

This whole time, Sebastian had never looked at Isabella, but instead stared intently at Leo across from him with a slight frown on his face, showing a hint of displeasure. "Can you ask some normal questions?" he said.

Leo sneered and chuckled, "We're all adults here, there's no need to avoid these basic questions."

Sebastian was about to speak when Isabella's voice softly sounded. "I don't want to answer, can I have a drink?"

This time, she had followed the rules of the game, so no one said anything.

Isabella drank another glass of liquor. She took advantage of the fact that the alcohol hadn't affected her yet to quickly get up and say, "I'm going to the bathroom, you guys have fun."

After she finished speaking, she left the private room.

---

As soon as she left, Leo asked, "Who drew the 'Dare' card? Show us."

Everyone showed their cards, and Sebastian was the last one.

Leo looked at his card, smiled slightly, and said, "Do you dare play, Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian leaned back in his chair and casually smiled at him. "Sure."

"Then go find Ms. Miller right now and say something to her."

Sebastian frowned, "What?"

Leo pondered for a moment, his eyes filled with wickedness. "You have to say that you've liked her for a long time and ask if she's willing to be your woman. Just that one sentence."

The room fell silent again.

Before Sebastian could speak, Vanessa suddenly stood up and said, "It's just a game, Leo, don't go too far!"

Vanessa had a strong reaction to this, which caused the others in the room who were not participating in the game to look over. Laura's hand reaching for the juice paused, looking at Vanessa in surprise, with a hint of confusion in her eyes.

Leo smiled faintly, glanced at Vanessa, and said, "You said it yourself, it's just a game. If you're afraid to play then don't play, so you won't be ridiculed."

With that, he threw down his card and walked to the window to light a cigarette.

Vanessa said, "Let's stop playing and do something else."

But no one moved.

Because their boss, Sebastian, had not spoken yet.

Vanessa looked at Sebastian. "It's just a game, Mr. Landon. You don't have to take it seriously."

Sebastian looked around, and one by one, everyone he looked at lowered their heads. After a moment of silence, he said, "Since I'm the boss, if I can say it, I should be able to do it in order to gain everyone's respect."

He stood up. "I'll go."

"Mr. Landon..." Vanessa reached out anxiously to stop him. "You can't go!"

Although it was just a game, she still cared about this, especially since it was about Isabella.

Laura spoke up. "This is the last round, Vanessa. Since Mr. Landon said that, we shouldn't stop him. Besides, it's not that embarrassing. We can explain it to Isabella afterwards. I believe she'll understand."

---

Isabella spent half an hour in the bathroom, but couldn't throw up. Alcohol lingered in her chest, burning like a fire in her stomach, making her extremely uncomfortable.

She thought she should leave, so she stepped out lightly. When she opened the door, she saw Sebastian.

Isabella froze in place.

She didn't even have time to step back. Sebastian turned his head and looked at her, his deep gaze immediately capturing her.

Isabella composed herself and walked out. "Mr. Landon."

She stood by the sink, washing her hands, feeling Sebastian's gaze.

After washing her hands, Isabella turned to leave.

But Sebastian suddenly stopped her.

"Wait, Isabella."

Isabella had just taken a step outside, but she stopped in her tracks. "Is there something you need, Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian looked at her and noticed the redness on her cheeks from the alcohol, which somehow looked cute to him. Her nose was also red. The way she looked right now inexplicably touched him.

"I have something to say to you." Sebastian stood up straight.

"Go ahead," Isabella lowered her head.

Sebastian hesitated for a moment, then said, "I've liked you for a long time..."

Isabella looked up, extremely shocked.

"Will you be my woman?"
###chapter 20 I Thought Someone Broke into the House
After Sebastian finished speaking, Isabella remained motionless.

She never expected that Sebastian would say that to her. She thought she was drunk and hallucinating, because Sebastian would never say that to her.

"Mr. Landon?" Isabella felt even dizzier.

Sebastian paused for a moment. He hadn't expected such a big reaction from her. When he saw her stumbling with unsteady steps, he subconsciously reached out to support her.

The private room was hot. Isabella had taken off her coat a long time ago, now she was only wearing a short-sleeved shirt, revealing her beautifully curved arms. As Sebastian held onto her, he felt the warmth and softness of her skin in the palm of his hand, and his mind instantly returned to that night...

"Isabella!" Vanessa's timely appearance broke the romantic atmosphere.

She took Isabella's hand from Sebastian, concern written all over her face. "Isabella, are you alright?"

Isabella shook her head, feeling even more ashamed in front of Vanessa. After all, Vanessa was Sebastian's girlfriend, but Sebastian had just said those things to her...

When Sebastian saw Vanessa, he said, "I'm leaving now, take care of her."

"Don't worry, Mr. Landon." Vanessa nodded, watching Sebastian leave before refocusing her attention on Isabella. "Isabella, why is your face so red?"

Isabella waved her hand. "I'm fine..."

Vanessa helped her toward a private room. "What did Mr. Landon say to you, Isabella?"

Isabella's heart tightened, pondering for a moment. She believed it would be best not to interfere with their relationship, so she shook her head. "Nothing."

"Alright." Vanessa's eyes flickered with understanding as she pretended not to care. "In the game, Mr. Landon drew a 'Dare' card. If he said anything inappropriate, I apologize on his behalf. You don't have to feel embarrassed. Those weren't his true feelings. Leo made him say those things."

Isabella breathed a sigh of relief. "I understand..."

When they returned to the private room, Laura and Leo were already gone.

Sebastian didn't return to the room either. Vanessa picked up her bag and said, "You guys can continue. I have something to attend to. The bill has already been settled."

Everyone waved goodbye to her.

Isabella waited for two minutes before silently getting up and leaving.

As she walked out, she happened to see Sebastian's car driving by. She couldn't see what was inside through the car window, but Isabella had a feeling that Vanessa was also in the car.

- - -

Sebastian had also had a few drinks, although not enough to get drunk. However, he still felt a slight buzz.

Jack was driving, and Sebastian sat in the back, closing his eyes to rest.

Vanessa sat next to him. "I already explained everything to Isabella."

Sebastian opened his eyes, responding in a calm tone. As he thought of Isabella, he remembered the feeling of her smooth and delicate skin in his palm... Desire surged within him, and Sebastian turned his head to look at Vanessa.

Vanessa bit her lip, leaning closer to him, her hands climbing up his neck. "Mr. Landon..."

Sebastian gently lifted her chin with his fingers, staring into her eyes, his voice slightly husky. "Come to my place, alright?"

Vanessa was overjoyed, but she restrained her expression and lowered her head shyly, softly saying, "Okay."

Half an hour later, the car stopped outside Sebastian's mansion.

Jack sat in the car, watching Sebastian and Vanessa walk into the mansion together. He frowned slightly.

This wasn't Vanessa's first time at Sebastian's house. As his assistant, she had come here twice, but at that time, she had been with others for work.

This time, she had come alone.

That unique honor made Vanessa feel a bit floaty.

Sebastian handed her a pair of slippers. As they entered the living room, Vanessa hugged him from behind. Her voice trembled with excitement as she said, "Mr. Landon... please don't turn on the lights."

Sebastian had held back all night, but his desire surged as she teased him. He turned around, firmly grasping Vanessa's wrist and pulling her onto the couch.

"Mr. Landon... Mr. Landon..." Vanessa called out to him in the darkness, her voice soft and seductive.

Sebastian clenched her wrist, listening to her urgent cries, but the fire in his heart gradually subsided.

When Vanessa saw that he wasn't responding, she Vanessa took the initiative to turn over, straddling his lap, her arms embracing his neck as she pressed her red lips against his.

Sebastian tightened his grip on her hand, feeling some resistance toward her deep in his heart, but held back. After all, they had a pleasant time that night...

As Vanessa's lips were about to touch his, the lights in the room suddenly turned on.

The sudden brightness startled them. Sebastian turned his face slightly to the side, and Vanessa's red lips landed on his face.

"Why did you come back so late, Boy?" said an aged voice.

Before Vanessa could react, Sebastian pushed her aside. "Why are you still awake, Grandma?"

"You thought I was asleep?" Zoe glanced at Vanessa, her face full of displeasure. "I'm old, so I don't sleep very deeply. I heard noises downstairs, but the lights were off the whole time. I thought there was a thief in the house."

Sebastian stood up and walked away to pour himself a drink. He raised an eyebrow and smiled. "So you came down to catch the thief?"

Zoe snorted coldly. Her gaze fell on Vanessa's face once again. After observing her for a while, she asked, "Who is this?"

Before Sebastian could answer, Vanessa eagerly introduced herself. "Hello, my name is Vanessa."

"Oh," Zoe responded casually. She probably didn't remember her name at all. Then, she said, "It's late, why haven't you gone home yet?"

She wanted her to go home?

Vanessa looked around and thought to herself, 'This place will be my home in the future.'

Vanessa fell silent for a moment, but Sebastian did not help her out. 

She had no choice but to stand up and say, "Mr. Landon, I'll head back." 

She thought Sebastian would speak up and try to keep her there. After all, they had only just begun. She believed Sebastian was also feeling uneasy. 

But Sebastian remained silent. 

Vanessa started to walk toward the entrance. As she was about to change her shoes, Sebastian spoke up. "Wait." 

Vanessa felt relieved and waited for him to come and persuade her to stay. 

She heard footsteps behind her and turned around with joy in her heart, only to see Sebastian handing her bag to her and saying, "Here, take this." 

Vanessa took her bag with some disappointment, pursed her lips, and looked at him with a plaintive expression. 

Sebastian stayed silent for a while and said, "It's late, I'll get Jack to take you back." 

Vanessa's eyes filled with disappointment. 

At this point, all hope was finally shattered. 

She knew Sebastian wouldn't try to keep her there anymore, so she forced a smile and said, "Okay... see you tomorrow." 

"See you tomorrow." Sebastian nodded, but didn't see her off. 

As soon as the door closed, Sebastian turned around, and Zoe knocked him on the head. 

Zoe withdrew her hand, her expression unchanged, and unhappily asked, "You better explain to me what's going on here."
###chapter 21 Not Waiting for Her Anymore
The car left Sebastian's villa. Vanessa only looked away when the villa was completely out of sight. She asked Jack, "I never saw that old woman before when I came to Mr. Landon's house. Is she really Mr. Landon's grandmother?"

"Yes," Jack replied while driving. "Mrs. Landon used to live alone. But she got sick, and Mr. Landon was worried about her, so he brought her over."

Vanessa frowned. "Will she be living there from now on?"

There was nothing wrong with her question, but Jack felt that there was a hint of disdain in Vanessa's tone. He frowned and said, "You'll have to ask Mr. Landon about that."

Vanessa thought that she would ask Sebastian when she had the chance. How could young people live with elderly people in this day and age,? It wouldn't be a problem if he were single, but she was about to move in with him, and they would inevitably be intimate. If something like tonight were to happen again... it would be inconvenient.

"What did you say?" Zoe acted like she had heard something serious. She had been sitting calmly on the sofa, but she stood up abruptly.

Sebastian appeared to be calm. "Haven't you been telling me to get married because you want grandchildren?"

"I was anxious and did tell you that, but I never told you to just find anyone to be your girlfriend," Zoe replied urgently.

Sebastian remained silent for a while. "Don't you like Vanessa?"

"I don't!" Zoe answered very firmly with no hesitation. "You can tell a person's character from their appearance, and Vanessa doesn't seem like a good girl to me."

"She used to be in my assistant department. She was in the company for over a year, and I know her quite well..."

Zoe looked at him puzzled, "She used to be your subordinate? Doesn't your company prohibit office relationships?"

Sebastian felt somewhat helpless. "My... encounter with her was an accident."

Zoe was displeased. "Since they were both your subordinates, why didn't you have an 'accident' with Isabella? Why did you choose that woman?"

Sebastian didn't know how to answer that.

---

Isabella returned to the dorm and lay down after taking a shower.

It might have been because of the alcohol she drank, but she slept heavily and missed her alarm. When she picked up her phone and looked at it, it was 8 o'clock.

She rushed to the company, but she was still half an hour late.

According to the company's rules, being half an hour late meant a deduction of $100, which made Isabella feel sad.

As soon as she settled down, Jack walked over and knocked on her desk. "Isabella, get Mr. Williams' contract and go out with Mr. Landon later."

"Okay."

Since Sebastian had requested her to participate in this collaboration with Andy, Isabella was obliged to be present when the contract was signed.

She checked the contract and put it in a bag when Laura suddenly called to her. "Isabella, come here for a moment."

Isabella got up and walked over. Laura threw a stack of documents at her, "These are some newly organized expired materials. Can you please take them to the resource room? Thank you."

Isabella was usually the one who handled these things, so she had no reason to refuse. She took the stack of materials to the resource room. It only took about ten minutes for her to organize the expired materials. 

However, when she tried to leave, she found that the door was locked from the outside.

Isabella panicked and fought with the door for ten minutes, but the door didn't budge. She had failed.

Unfortunately, she had left her phone on the desk.

Isabella had to wait for someone to come and open the door, but the resource room only contained unused materials. Even if someone did come, she might still have to wait for a long time.

On the other side, Jack walked out with Sebastian and quickly scanned the area. He didn't see Isabella in her usual spot, so he paused and asked, "Where's Isabella?"

Laura stood up and replied, "I don't know. She went somewhere with a stack of documents."

"I told her to prepare to go out with Mr. Landon," Jack said, glancing at Sebastian. Sebastian was known to dislike people being late. It was an important moment, but Isabella had disappeared.

Sebastian checked the time on his watch and said, "Call her and find out where she is."

"Alright," Jack quickly pulled out his phone. Isabella's phone rang, but it was on her desk.

Sebastian said, "We don't need to wait for her."

He looked around the assistant's office. Normally, he would have taken Vanessa with him, but Vanessa had already resigned. Laura stood there, her gaze filled with anticipation.

Based on qualifications, besides Vanessa, Laura was the most suitable among all the female assistants.

However, Sebastian remained silent for a moment before saying, "Let's go."

He didn't mention Laura.

The two of them walked toward the elevator, but Laura caught up from behind them and said, "Mr. Landon, since Isabella isn't here, can I come with you?"

Laura's ambition was clearly written on her face.

Sebastian didn't even glance at her and said to Jack, "Get her to contact Isabella. Once she reaches Isabella, tell her to hurry to the signing location."

"Yes, Mr. Landon," Jack turned and said, "Laura, you contact Isabella and ask her to come as soon as possible."

After that, they entered the elevator and left.

Laura stared at the numbers on the elevator wall and stomped her foot in frustration.

---

Isabella had been locked up all day until someone finally came to the document room to retrieve something just before everyone was about to leave.

When she rushed back to the office and stepped out of the elevator, she ran into Jack.

When Jack saw her, he asked, "Isabella, where have you been all day? If you didn't come back, we would have called the police."

"I'm sorry, Mr. Brown, I..." Isabella started to explain.

"You don't need to explain to me. Go explain to Mr. Landon," Jack shook his head and genuinely felt sorry for her for missing such a great opportunity.

Isabella bit her lip and resignedly walked toward Sebastian's office. She raised her hand and knocked on the door.

"Come in," Sebastian's voice came through the door.

Isabella pushed the door open. She found him sitting in a chair with his back to the door, so she could only see half of his head.

"Mr. Landon." Isabella stood there uncertainly. "I'm sorry, I made a mistake today... Did I disrupt the contract signing between you and Mr. Williams?"

Once the opportunity was lost, it was lost. Although she felt regretful, there was nothing she could do. She would feel better if the company had not suffered any losses.

Sebastian remained silent.

Isabella felt very guilty. As she thought about Jack's attitude toward her, and how Sebastian was now speechless because of her, her guilt intensified. She closed her eyes and made up her mind. "If I caused any losses to the company, I'm willing to accept any punishment, including resignation."

The man in the chair turned around. Isabella could feel his gaze, but she didn't have the courage to meet his eyes.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Landon, I'll pack up and leave the company." After Isabella finished speaking, she turned around and walked out.

At this moment, the office door was opened, and Sebastian walked in from outside.

When she saw him, Isabella was stunned, "Mr. Landon?"
###chapter 22 You Like That Kind of Girl
"Weren't you there?" Isabella turned her head to look at the chair, only to find another man sitting there.
Isabella immediately froze. "Mr. Jose?"

Zaire, a long-term partner of the Landon Group, was also a good friend of Sebastian's. He didn't come to the company often, but Isabella had seen him from afar a few times. Isabella remembered him because of his outstanding appearance.

She had said so much, but she had been talking to the wrong person?

Was it all useless?

Sebastian held some documents in his hand. It looked like he had just finished a meeting. His gaze fell on Isabella's face, and when he saw that her eyes were red, he felt like something was tugging at his heart. He immediately turned his gaze to the man sitting in the chair and frowned. "Did you say something to her?"

Zaire raised his hands. "You've got me all wrong. I haven't said a word."

Sebastian obviously didn't believe him and looked at Isabella inquiringly.

Isabella couldn't hide her embarrassment and hurriedly said, "He didn't do anything, Mr. Landon. I misunderstood..."

Misunderstood?

"Were you looking for me?" Sebastian asked her, unconsciously softening his tone.

"Yes. Mr. Landon. did I cause any trouble today? I'm sorry..." Isabella bowed her head.

Sebastian frowned as he looked at her, saying, "No."

"Really?" Isabella still wasn't reassured.

Sebastian softened and nodded, "Yes. The contract has been signed, and we still need to follow-up with Mr. Williams's team, but just don't be absent next time."

"Next time?" Isabella was stunned. There would be a next time?

Sebastian smiled. "I'll forgive you this time."

"Thank you, Mr. Landon!" Isabella was pleasantly surprised and almost bumped into the door on her way out.

Sebastian couldn't help but smile as he watched her. When he turned around, he met Zaire's thoughtful gaze. "Do you like that kind of girl?"

Sebastian resumed his indifferent expression and placed the documents on the table. He went to pour himself a glass of water. "Why are you here today?"

"I came to ask you for a favor."

Sebastian's expression turned wary. "What?"

"My sister." Zaire scratched his head helplessly. "You know, she likes you. She knows she can't ask you out herself, so she's begged me for to help her ask you out for a long time. Would you consider meeting her once? What if you suddenly become interested in my sister?"

Sebastian glanced at him calmly. "I can't date my friend's sister."

"I don't mind." Zaire put his hand on Sebastian's shoulder, not hiding his calculating smile. "If you become my sister's husband, my parents will approve. Our whole family will welcome you. How about it?"

Sebastian put down his glass and calmly removed Zaire's hand from his shoulder. "I'm not interested."

"Please, do me a favor. Otherwise, she'll keep pestering me when I go home. I can't stand it anymore."

Sebastian's expression remained unchanged. "I can't help you."

"Why? Give me a reasonable explanation."

Sebastian paused and said, "I already have a girlfriend."

Zaire immediately said, "That's impossible! You'll swat a mosquito if it touches you. How could you have a girlfriend?"

"Believe it or not, it's true."

Zaire pondered for a while as he saw Sebastian's serious expression which was completely unlike his usual joking self. "Do you really have a girlfriend?"

"Yes." Sebastian didn't even lift his head and answered decisively.

"Was it that shy assistant from earlier?" Zaire pointed to the door.

Sebastian frowned. "No."

"Then who is it?" Zaire was very curious.

"You don't know her."

Zaire walked out of the office with a perplexed expression.

"Mr. Jose." Laura walked over enthusiastically. "I'll escort you out."

But Zaire shook his head and pointed toward a corner. "She can escort me."

Isabella had suddenly been called out, drawing the attention of the crowd. She pressed the elevator button and went down with Zaire. 

As the elevator doors closed, Zaire asked, "What's your name?" 

"Isabella."

"You're quite beautiful."

Isabella glanced at Zaire and said, "You're... quite handsome too, Mr. Jose."

"Haha," Zaire laughed. "You're really polite."

Isabella remained silent, her eyes fixed on the changing numbers in the elevator.

"Hey, let me ask you a question." Zaire seemed like he wasn't going to change the subject. "Do you know who slept with Mr. Landon?"

Isabella's heart skipped a beat. "No... I don't know."

"You really don't know?" Zaire stood beside her, looking down at her face. "Why are you trembling so much?"

He leaned closer to her and lowered his voice. "Could it be... you?"

Isabella's widened and gripped her sweaty palms guiltily.

Ding!

The elevator arrived on the first floor and the doors opened.

Isabella regained her composure. "You're very funny, Mr. Jose."

Zaire put his hands in his pockets and looked at her blushing face. "I don't think it's you. From what I know about Sebastian, he likes sexy women. And you... are too shy."

Isabella fell silent.

Why did that sound so awkward?

At the company entrance, Isabella bent down to the car. "Goodbye, Mr. Jose."

Zaire smiled slightly. "Until next time."

After watching Zaire drive away, Isabella turned around and headed back to the company. As she passed through the lobby, a familiar voice suddenly called out to her. "Isabella?"

Isabella paused and turned her head to see Samantha walking toward her.

"Isabella? Is that really you?" Samantha's face was filled with disbelief as her gaze swept over Isabella. "I thought I was mistaken, but I didn't expect it to be you. You have a new job  at the Landon Group, right?"

Isabella noticed the resume in Samantha's hand, but she didn't want to exchange pleasantries with her. She nodded and said, "I have something to do, so I have to go."

"Hey, Isabella..." Samantha caught up with her. "Um, which department are you in?"

Isabella pressed the elevator button and turned her head. "What does it have to do with you?"

Samantha hesitated for a moment. Isabella was being unusually cold to her. "Isabella, are you still angry at me because of Matthew? I know this situation has caused you some pain, but... but Matthew and I truly love each other. You know, we can't control our feelings. I understand that what we did hurt you deeply, and I'm not asking you to forgive me, I just hope you won't hate us."

"I don't hate you," Isabella said calmly.

"Really?" Samantha's face lit up with joy, and she immediately reached out to grab Isabella's hand. "I knew you were the best, Isabella."

Isabella glanced at Samantha holding her hand, frowned, and pulled her hand back. She looked into Samantha's eyes and calmly said, "I don't hate you, I just think you two are disgusting."

Samantha froze.
###chapter 23 Don't Use It Again Next Time
"Bella..." Samantha looked very aggrieved, as if Isabella was the one who had done something wrong and Samantha was the one who had been hurt.

But Isabella would not be deceived. She said, "Matthew isn't here, so you don't have to pretend in front of me. And don't say you can't control your feelings. If you really can't, there'd be no difference between you two and animals."

Samantha hadn't expect her to be so sharp. Her face turned pale. "You can judge me however you want, Bella, but don't say that about Matthew..."

"I'm not interested in judging you, and I'm even less interested in judging Matthew." Isabella looked away. "I hope you won't disturb me anymore, and please address me by my full name in the future. We are not friends."

Ding.

The elevator arrived.

Isabella didn't even look at Samantha and walked straight into the elevator.

Samantha watched as the elevator doors closed, biting her lip in frustration. Instead of leaving immediately, she stared at the numbers on the elevator panel as it continued to go up, until it reached the top floor of the building.

She hurried back to the front desk and asked, "What department is on the highest floor?"

The front desk girl glanced at her. "That's the CEO's office. Do you have any business there?"

"Okay." Samantha handed over her resume. "I'm here for an interview."

"Interviews are on the third floor," the front desk girl said.

"Okay, thank you." Samantha asked, "Do you know which department Isabella works in?"

"Isabella?" The front desk girl shook her head. 

There were too many people in the company, so she couldn't remember who Isabella was.

Samantha reminded her, "She's the girl I was talking to just now."

The girl at the front desk was cautious. "Why are you asking?" 

"We used to be good friends, but we had a small disagreement which caused our relationship to suffer. I was glad to run into her here, and I just want to know if we'll become colleagues in the same department."

"Oh. That girl's probably from the CEO's office."

"The CEO's office?" Samantha pursed her lips. She hadn't expected Isabella to be in the CEO's office at the Landon Group.

Zaire had just driven onto the overpass when Kelsey called.

"Hey, Zaire, how did it go? Did you succeed?" Kelsey stood in front of a large mirror, holding her phone in one hand and gesturing with the other as she adjusted her dress.

"I didn't..." Zaire didn't finish his sentence before Kelsey screamed, interrupting him. "Zaire! I don't want to hear that, it's not good!"

Zaire was speechless.

"Use any means necessary! I have to have dinner with Sebastian tonight!"

Zaire lamented, "Please stop torturing me! I really did my best..."

"No, I don't want to hear it! I don't care! I just want to have dinner with Sebastian! If I can't have dinner with him tonight, if I can't see him, you can start getting ready for my funeral!"

Zaire squeezed his temples tightly. When Kelsey stopped screaming, he said, "Do you mind if I invite someone else to dinner with us?"

"Who?"

"Sebastian's girlfriend."

After work, Isabella received a call from Nina, inviting her to dinner at a restaurant near the company.

Isabella knew that restaurant was quite expensive. As she thought about how Nina was usually reluctant to spend even on a buffet, Isabella suggested, "I know a small restaurant nearby that has good food and reasonable prices. Should we go there?"

Nina hesitated for a moment before saying, "Charlie's buying tonight. He just received a bonus, so you don't have to worry about money. Let's go there, and take care on your way."

"Okay." Isabella was confused, but she agreed.

Isabella knew what kind of person Charlie was. If he was willing to spend so much money on her, he probably had something in mind.

Isabella took a taxi to the restaurant, but Nina and Charlie hadn't arrived yet. She informed the waiter that she was waiting for someone, and the waiter led her to the reserved table, poured her a glass of juice, and asked her to wait.

Isabella gazed at the bustling street and bright lights outside the glass window, lost in thought.

Her eyes followed a black car as it parked at the entrance of the restaurant. The car door opened, and a man and a woman got out. The woman was wearing a red dress and delicate makeup. They walked into the restaurant together, smiling and holding each other.

The waiter guided the two of them toward Isabella. 

Isabella wanted to hide, but she couldn't do it in time. 

The man and the woman's gaze landed on her almost at the same time. 

"Isabella?" Vanessa looked surprised and turned to Sebastian. "Did you invite Isabella to dinner too? Why didn't you tell me?" 

Isabella stood up and awkwardly said, "Mr. Landon." 

Then she explained to Vanessa, "Mr. Landon didn't invite me here." 

Vanessa looked at the table number and her smile grew even brighter. "My mistake. So, you made plans to eat here with someone else, Isabella." 

"Yes." 

"Are you having dinner with your boyfriend?" 

Isabella hesitated, and Sebastian frowned slightly. He felt that Vanessa was asking that on purpose.
 
Isabella shook her head. "I'm having dinner with my sister and brother-in-law." 

"Okay." A trace of disappointment flashed in Vanessa's eyes, but she quickly smiled and said, "This is a nice place. You should come here with your boyfriend next time." 

As they spoke, Vanessa linked arms with Sebastian and moved closer to him. 

Sebastian suddenly turned his head and glanced at her. "What perfume are you wearing tonight?" 

"It's orange perfume. I just bought it, does it smell good?" Vanessa had done some research to please him and knew that he liked fruity scents, so she had deliberately chosen an orange perfume to wear tonight. 

But Sebastian didn't seem to like it and casually said, "Don't use it next time." 

Vanessa felt a bit awkward in front of Isabella and forced a smile. 

-----

Sebastian and Vanessa walked inside and sat in their designated seats. 

After a while, Zaire and Kelsey arrived. 

"Sebastian." Kelsey sat down next to Sebastian and completely ignored Vanessa's presence, her eyes fixed on Sebastian. "It's been a long time since we last saw each other. You've become even more handsome." 

Sebastian remained expressionless, "Let me introduce you, this is my girlfriend, Vanessa." 

Vanessa immediately stood up, holding a glass of juice, and greeted Kelsey. "It's nice to meet you, Ms. Jose." 
"Her?" Kelsey stared at Vanessa, stunned. "Isn't she your former assistant? She was the one who received me the last time I went to the Landon Group. How is she your girlfriend? Sebastian, even if you want to get rid of me, you should find a prettier actress." 

Was Kelsey implying that she was ugly?
###chapter 24 Shy Assistant
Vanessa's mouth twitched.

"Kelsey," Zaire tugged on Kelsey's arm, desperately signaling to her.

Kelsey pouted and said, "I'm just telling the truth. I don't believe she's Sebastian's girlfriend! Unless..."

"Unless what?"

"If they kiss right in front of me, I'll believe it."

Vanessa's hand trembled as she held her cup and instinctively glanced at Sebastian.

Sebastian was holding his phone and sitting comfortably, but his attention was clearly not at the table. He looked off in a certain direction where Isabella happened to be. She sat alone quietly, even though she was in a busy restaurant. He felt sorry for her as he saw her looking so lonely.

Suddenly, Vanessa blocked his line of sight and said, "Sebastian..."

Vanessa looked at him expectantly. She was even a little excited. After all, she had never dared imagine kissing Sebastian before. Even though she was his girlfriend now, Sebastian hadn't touched her for the past few days. She was looking forward to having a real relationship with Sebastian, but she couldn't rush into action or else he would suspect she was up to something. For her, Kelsey's request, was like a heaven-sent opportunity.

Sebastian frowned and looked at Kelsey. "Whether you believe it or not, it's the truth."

Kelsey smiled. "You're afraid to prove it, so it can't be true. If you really are together, why would you try to avoid kissing each other? You're lying, Sebastian."

Sebastian fell silent.

She was right. If they really were together, they wouldn't avoid kissing like this.

But when he saw Vanessa's face, there was a slight sense of disgust deep in his heart. He didn't know how he had become addicted that night, and kissing her repeatedly... Or maybe it was just because he was drunk that day. If he had been sober, he would never have done such a crazy thing with Vanessa. Sebastian felt some regret as he thought of that.

---

After Isabella waited for a while, Nina and Charlie arrived.

As soon as Charlie arrived, he handed the menu to Isabella and said, "Order whatever you want, Bella. I'm paying today."

Isabella didn't plan to save him any money, so she opened the menu and ordered a few dishes.

Nina noticed that Isabella had ordered the food she loved, so she took the menu and ordered two more dishes Isabella loved.

Charlie immediately looked at her disapprovingly. "I already said I invited Bella to dinner, so she should be the one to order food. Why are you ordering too?"

But since had already happened, and Charlie could only complain and couldn't really cancel the order.

When the dishes were almost ready, Charlie got to the point. "Bella, last time I saw you, I was in a hurry and didn't have a chance to ask you more questions. Are you working at the Landon Group?"

Isabella knew that Charlie probably knew everything since he was asking that question, so she couldn't lie. She nodded and said, "Yes."

"Which department are you in?" Charlie asked immediately, "I saw you with Mr. Brown. You seem to have a high position at the Landon Group."

Isabella held her knife and fork and calmly said, "I'm just an assistant. I haven't finished my internship yet."

"You're just an intern, but your boss is willing to take you out for business meetings. That shows that he values you! Many people want this job, Bella, so you better do it well."

"I will."

Charlie became more and more excited as he spoke, "I've seen the president of the Landon Group. He looks like he's only in his thirties. I heard that he started from scratch and is an outstanding young person. I also heard that he's always been single. You look good, Bella. If he becomes interested in you, it would be a lucky opportunity for you two."

Nina hurriedly patted him. "Stop talking nonsense."

"What do you mean? They're both single. If he becomes interested in Bella, it would be extra lucky for you guys."

Isabella listened quietly and waited until Charlie finished speaking before asking, "Did you come to see me today just to talk about this?"

Charlie stopped talking, laughed, and said, "I heard that the Landon Group is looking for partners, which happens to align with the new project our company is developing. Bella, can you try to maneuver and fight for an opportunity for me?"

Isabella shook her head, "You overestimated me. Like I said, I'm just an intern who hasn't finished my internship. I don't have any power in the company."

"Please don't reject me right away, Bella. If I can partner with the Landon Group, I can get a promotion and a substantial bonus." Charlie said, holding Nina's hand. "Your sister has been with me for many years, but I haven't been able to give her a good life. Instead, she's suffered a lot with me. If I can get a promotion, your sister can stop working and be a full-time housewife. She's worked hard for many years and deserves to rest."

"I'm sorry, I can't help you," Isabella said. Although she was gentle by nature, she could clearly distinguish between business and personal matters. She couldn't make decisions for the company, and even if she could, she wouldn't just agree to Charlie's request without thinking about it.

Charlie became a bit impatient when he saw her response, but he didn't say much.

After finishing their meal, Charlie used the excuse of having something to do at home and left with Nina.

When Isabella was about to leave as well, the waiter approached with the bill and asked, "Will you pay the $500 now, Miss?"

Isabella was taken aback and asked, "Didn't my brother-in-law pay?"

The waiter shook his head.

Isabella took out her wallet, but she didn't have much money. She took out two savings cards, but even after using all her money, she was still short $100.

Not having money made life difficult, especially for Isabella. $100 was not a small amount of money for her.

Blushing, Isabella asked, "Can I... put it on a tab?"

The waiter was stunned.

The waiter didn't want to force her to pay, but he couldn't handle this situation either, so he called the manager.

The manager politely said, "Sorry, Ma'am, we don't have tabs at our store. If you're having difficulties, you can call your family for help."

Nina and Charlie had just left. Nina probably didn't know that Charlie hadn't paid. While they were eating, Isabella thought Nina seemed in a good mood, probably because Charlie had been treating her well lately. Isabella didn't want to ruin their relationship, so she wouldn't call Nina.

Isabella thought for a moment and said, "Please hold on."

She turned around and walked toward Sebastian's table.

Isabella had originally wanted to ask Vanessa for money, but she didn't see her at the table. At this moment, Zaire noticed her and said, "Hey, isn't that your shy assistant?"

Shy assistant?

Isabella blushed when she heard that nickname.

Sebastian turned his head to look at her, his deep gaze softening when it fell on Isabella.
###chapter 25 If Itâ€™s Not Enough, Let Me Know
"Isabella," Sebastian softly called her name. "Did you need something?"

Isabella stood up straight, feeling a little embarrassed. "I was looking for Vanessa..."

"What do you need her for?" Sebastian quickly interrupted.

Zaire raised an eyebrow, giving him a meaningful look.

Since it didn't matter who she borrowed money from, Isabella hesitated for a moment and said, "Mr. Landon, I... wanted to borrow some money from you."

"How much do you need?"

"A hundred dollars."

Sebastian didn't even ask what she wanted it for. He just agreed. 

Isabella felt a bit shy and embarrassed. "Thank you."

Sebastian picked up his phone. After a while, Isabella's phone beeped. He said, "I've transferred it to you."

"Thank you, Mr. Landon."

"You're welcome," Sebastian said calmly, "If it's not enough, let me know."

Isabella was stunned.

She didn't know how to respond to this, so she just said thank you again and turned to pay.

Sebastian watched her leave and fell into deep thought.

Zaire stared at him for a while and suddenly said, "I think that assistant is quite interesting."

Sebastian didn't answer, drinking his juice to moisten his dry throat.

"If you don't mind, I'd like to date her," Zaire said with a smile as he reached out a hand.

Sebastian glanced at him with a slight smile, but his voice was cold and heavy, "If you dare get a girlfriend from my company, I'll make sure you never have one for the rest of your life."

Zaire had nothing to say.

-----

After dinner, the four of them walked out of the restaurant together.

Vanessa held onto Sebastian's arm. When the car arrived, and she waved goodbye to Kelsey. " Goodbye, Ms. Jose."

Kelsey rolled her eyes directly, rudely saying, "I don't want to see you again."

Vanessa smiled awkwardly and politely. She didn't feel angry even though Kelsey treated her like that. Instead, she felt proud. Kelsey was being rude to her because of Sebastian. That outstanding man belonged only to her, and Vanessa felt an unprecedented sense of pride and satisfaction.

As Sebastian's car drove away, Kelsey got into Zaire's car and urged, "Zaire, hurry! Follow them!"

Zaire asked in confusion, "What are you doing?"

"Follow them!" Kelsey urged. "I want to see if Vanessa is living with Sebastian!"

Zaire sighed. "Sebastian has admitted it himself, but you still don't believe it?"

"I won't believe it until I see it with my own eyes!" Kelsey insisted determinedly. "I don't believe Sebastian has such poor taste! He would never be interested in Vanessa!"

Zaire didn't know what to say.

He was also quite puzzled. Sebastian didn't seem very interested in Vanessa, so why had he accepted her as his girlfriend? Were they pretending?

Zaire was very curious. He stepped on the gas pedal and the car sped away, closely following Sebastian.

In the car, Jack said, "There's a car following us, Mr. Landon."

Vanessa turned around and looked. "It looks like Mr. Jose's car. I guess Ms. Jose doesn't believe our relationship is real and wants to follow us to find out."

Sebastian remained silent for a moment and said to Jack, "Let's go home."

"Alright, Mr. Landon."

Vanessa's lips curved calmly. "But I haven't moved my things over yet..."

"We have all the necessities at home. You can stay for one night and move your things tomorrow," Sebastian said without changing his expression.

"Alright," Vanessa nodded. "Okay then."

The car raced all the way behind Sebastian. When they got to Sebastian's home, they saw Sebastian and Vanessa getting out of the car and entering the villa. Zaire looked at his sister. "Do you believe it now?"

"I don't believe it!" Kelsey said angrily. "They must be lying! We'll wait here, Zaire. I'm sure that woman will leave in the middle of the night!"

"Kelsey, there are plenty of men in the world. Don't limit yourself to just one man," Zaire lamented. Spending the night in the car would be uncomfortable. 

Kelsey said firmly, "If you don't want to stay, you can go back. I'll wait here by myself."

Zaire had no choice. He couldn't just leave her here by herself, so he had to stay with her and endure it together.

-----

Inside the villa, Sebastian led Vanessa to the door of a room on the second floor and pushed it open. "You'll stay here tonight."

Vanessa walked in eagerly, but when she looked around, she found that the room was a bit cold, without any trace of Sebastian's presence. It was obvious that she had been assigned to a guest room.

Although it was a guest room, it was still very large and luxurious. Compared to the small three-bedroom apartment Vanessa used to share, this place was heaven. Vanessa had always dreamed of living in a mansion like this, and she hadn't expect to achieve her dream at such a young age.

First, Vanessa toured the room, then she took a bath and put on a white bathrobe from the wardrobe. She didn't put on anything else underneath and went to see Sebastian.

There were several rooms on the second floor, but Vanessa immediately recognized Sebastian's room. The black door matched Sebastian's temperament perfectly. Vanessa stood at the door, calming her emotions, then raised her hand to knock. "Mr. Landon, are you asleep?"

Knock, knock.

Vanessa knocked on the door a few more times, but it remained quiet inside.

"Mr. Landon, can I come in?" Vanessa asked before opening the door.

The bedroom was dark, the curtains were closed, and a pleasant fragrance filled the air. Vanessa walked in excitedly, heading straight for the large bed. She pulled back the covers and climbed in.

A moment later, a piercing scream filled the room.

Sebastian heard the commotion outside the door and turned to walk over. "Are you alright, Grandma?"

When the door opened, a disheveled Vanessa appeared before Sebastian's eyes.

Sebastian froze. "Vanessa?"

An angry Zoe stormed out. "I can't believe I still have to deal with people taking advantage of me at my age. What do you think you should do about this, Sebastian?"

Sebastian was speechless.

---

In the living room downstairs, the room was brightly lit, and the three of them sat apart from each other.

Sebastian poured a glass of water for Zoe. "Have some water and calm down, Grandma."

"Calm down?" Zoe stared at him. "You expect me to calm down after being so humiliated?"

Vanessa was sobbing. She sat on the couch, head down, crying quite intensely. Suddenly, she dropped to her knees, hands on the floor. "I'm sorry, Mr. Landon. I... I didn't mean to..."

Sebastian was confused. "Why were you in Grandma's room?"

"I... I came out to get a drink of water, and then I walked into the wrong room..." Vanessa cried endlessly. This was the first time she had ever experienced such humiliation. It was first time she had climbed into someone else's bed, and it was Zoe's bed. Imagine the psychological trauma this would cause her!
###chapter 26 He Showed No Interest in Her
"You walked into the wrong room?" Zoe looked unconvinced. "I think you purposely walked into the wrong room. You sneaked into someone else's room in the middle of the night, naked, and climbed onto their bed. Who knows what you were planning to do?"

"I didn't... I really did walk into the wrong room..." Vanessa cried, struggling to catch her breath, feeling that she had been unjustly treated.

Sebastian couldn't blame her any further when he saw her like this. "Grandma, it's my fault. Vanessa is new here, it's normal for her to be unfamiliar with the place."

Zoe scoffed. "Next time, don't bring any annoying people home."

Vanessa clenched her lips, a glimmer of disgust flashing in her eyes. One day, she would kick Zoe out of here and make her realize who the true mistress of this place was!

Sebastian comforted Zoe and turned to Vanessa. "It's getting late, you should go back and rest."

Vanessa looked up, tears in her eyes, as she said, "Mr. Landon, I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to..."
"I know." Sebastian frowned. "You should rest."

"Alright," Vanessa stood up. As she passed Sebastian, she suddenly twisted her foot and lost her balance, falling onto him.

Sebastian instinctively reached out and helped her up. Her scent filled his nostrils, but Sebastian felt no physical attraction. He asked in a calmer tone, "Should I take you back?"

Vanessa felt disappointed as she sensed Sebastian's lack of interest. "No need, I'll go by myself."

---

The night quickly returned to quietness, and Sebastian dreamt of that night once again.

The woman's soft body enticed him, and he couldn't stop, continuing until he was exhausted, then fell asleep, holding onto the woman tightly...

Sebastian opened his eyes and realized it was already morning. He felt something wet and sticky on his body, removed the covers and saw the dark stain on his pants. His expression immediately turned heavy.

Knock knock.

Vanessa's voice came through the door. "Mr. Landon, are you awake?"

Sebastian still felt the impulse within him since he had just woken up from his dream. When he heard Vanessa's voice, he hesitated for a second, then covered himself with the blankets again and said to her, "Come in."

The door opened, and Vanessa walked in.

Sebastian reached out his hand to her, and Vanessa, feeling flattered, quickly handed her hand over, placing it in his palm.

Sebastian gently pulled her, and Vanessa naturally fell into his embrace, looking at him seductively. "Mr. Landon..."

Was Sebastian about to have sex with her?

People said men had the most urgent sexual needs in the morning.

It seemed like she had come at the right time. Sebastian needed a woman right now, and she happened to be able to fill that void. Vanessa slowly closed her eyes, anticipating what was about to happen...

But even though she waited for a long time, Sebastian didn't kiss her.

Vanessa opened her eyes and found Sebastian staring at her. There was no desire in his hawk-like eyes.

When Sebastian saw she was awake, he said, "Was it really you that night?"

Vanessa's heart raced, and she immediately replied, "Yes. Is there something wrong?"

"It's nothing," Sebastian supported her back and helped her sit up, his voice sounding muffled. "Please leave for now."

Vanessa looked at him unwillingly, biting her lip, but dared not say more. Silently, she exited his room. Closing the door behind her, Vanessa frowned deeply and recalled Sebastian's gaze and question. She couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.

After Sebastian got up and took a shower, he changed and felt refreshed. However, when he thought about his intimate moment with Vanessa, his eyebrows unconsciously furrowed. He looked at himself in the mirror, realized that he had wanted to do something, but when Vanessa entered his arms, the desire that lingered from his dreams disappeared instantly.

It turned out that he didn't have any physical reaction to Vanessa or any interest in her.

When Sebastian came downstairs, Vanessa was preparing breakfast. She turned around and smiled at him, saying, "Mr. Landon, breakfast is ready."

Sebastian glanced at the table and sat down. "Did you make all of this?"

"Yes. I saw fresh ingredients in the fridge, so I made some. I don't know if they suit your and Grandma's taste." Vanessa handed him some utensils.

Sebastian took a few bites. "It's delicious."

Vanessa felt proud of herself, but when she turned and saw Zoe approaching, she immediately suppressed her smile.

After eating a few bites, Sebastian put down his fork. "I'm going to the company. I'll be back late today."

Vanessa followed him to the foyer. "Shall I go with you?"

Sebastian looked at her. "You've resigned, so it would better for you not to go to the company."

"But I'm afraid your grandma won't like me..." Vanessa said. In reality, she thought Zoe was strange and difficult to get along with, so she didn't want to stay behind with her.

Sebastian replied, "Grandma is blunt, but she's actually very gentle. If you're going to stay here, you need to get along with her."

As he said that, Sebastian thought of Isabella. 'If she were Isabella, Grandma would definitely be delighted...' Sebastian was startled as he realized what he was thinking. He thought that if the woman who had entered the wrong tent that night was Isabella instead of Vanessa...

"Alright then." Vanessa reluctantly agreed.

Sebastian left the villa and honked the horn twice as he drove past the car that had been parked on the side of the road overnight.

The person in the car woke up and rolled down the window, revealing Zaire's face.

Through the car, Sebastian said, "You didn't sleep well all night. Aren't you going back to sleep?"

Zaire fell silent.

Without waiting for him to respond, Sebastian drove away.

Kelsey had also woken up. When Sebastian opened the car window, she had seen that he was the only one inside, which confirmed that Vanessa had stayed at his house last night and hadn't left in the morning.

Zaire stretched his neck and said, "Do you believe it now?"

Kelsey didn't say she didn't believe it this time, but said, "Zaire, you have to do me another favor."

Zaire looked wary and asked, "What... what are you planning to do now?"

"The assistant department at Sebastian's company needs a certain number of employees. With Vanessa gone, they'll definitely be hiring externally. You have to find a way to get me in."

Zaire was taken aback and said, "Forget it, Kelsey! You can't just get into Sebastian's assistant department. How can I get you in?"

"I don't care! I want to get into the Landon Group's assistant department! I want to become Sebastian's assistant and thoroughly investigate this!" Kelsey was extremely determined.

Zaire slumped heavily into a chair, feeling helpless. "So, you still don't believe it!"

- 

Isabella was the first to arrive at the company. She was busy all morning and remained at her desk during lunchtime.

When everyone else left, Isabella quietly took out a bag of bread from her bag and tore it open to take a bite, slowly chewing.

Last night's dinner had made her completely broke. She couldn't afford lunch, and she had also skipped breakfast. Fortunately, there were still some snacks Nina had bought for her. She made a plan to barely make it until payday by only eating one piece of bread for each meal.

As Isabella chewed on the bread, the door to the office opened and Sebastian and Jack walked out.
###chapter 27 You Should Eat Some Meat
Isabella was afraid of being seen, so she hastily hid under the desk and accidentally knocked over the water cup on the table. The water spilled all over the table, dripping onto her hair and collar.

Footsteps approached, and a pair of men's shoes appeared in front of Isabella, followed by Sebastian's voice from above. "Isabella?"

Isabella had no choice but to stand up, secretly hiding the bread behind her and blushing. She said, "Mr. Landon."

Sebastian's gaze paused at her collar for two seconds, "Why didn't you go to lunch?"

"I... I'm not hungry," Isabella lied.

As she finished saying she wasn't hungry, her stomach growled loudly. Isabella quickly covered her stomach with her hand, her face turning red.

Sebastian glanced at her stomach and said, "Come with me to the cafeteria. There's something I need to discuss with you about the collaboration project with Mr. Williams."

"Okay," Isabella stuffed the unfinished bread into the drawer, grabbed her notebook and pen, and hurriedly followed him.

Sebastian caused a stir in the employee cafeteria. As the company president, he rarely ate in the employee cafeteria.

Sebastian found a seat with a good view and Jack quickly served him a meal. Isabella stood next to him, the scent of the food constantly teasing her nose, making her even hungrier. 

"I'm so hungry," she said.

"I really want to eat!" 

"Sit, Isabella," Sebastian said. 

As Isabella sat down, she felt even hungrier. 

Sebastian looked at her and pushed a plate of pasta toward her. "Have some," he said. 

Isabella's defenses slowly crumbled. She knew that the cost of this meal meant nothing to Sebastian, and perhaps he had already seen through her lies. He was just respecting her by not calling her out on it. If she continued to refuse, she would really starve. 

But she still felt very awkward and couldn't eat comfortably. 

Fortunately, Jack was there. Sebastian didn't pay too much attention to her and quickly started a conversation with Jack about work. 

As they talked and ate, it seemed like Isabella wasn't even there. Gradually, Isabella relaxed. She picked up her fork and ate with small bites. 

"Isabella," Sebastian called her, instantly making her nervous. But he just smiled and said, "Why are you only eating pasta? You can have something else." 

"Okay, thank you, Mr. Landon," Isabella replied, using a serving fork to take some green vegetables for herself. 

Suddenly, there was a piece of meat on her plate. 

Isabella looked up in surprise. Sebastian put down the serving fork and said with concern, "Eat some meat, you're too thin." 

After saying that, he didn't immediately look away, but calmly locked eyes with Isabella. His gaze was warm and gentle, with a hint of sympathy, which made Isabella feel somewhat warmed. 

She lowered her head and said, "Thank you, Mr. Landon..."

Sebastian smiled slightly, seeming indifferent, then turned his head to continue talking with Jack. 

Not far away, several pairs of eyes were watching them closely. Laura had been keeping an eye on Isabella ever since she walked into the restaurant with Sebastian. When she saw Sebastian bring food to Isabella, she frowned. 

The female colleagues sitting with Laura were equally shocked and began discussing them. 

"What kind of relationship do Isabella and Mr. Landon have? Why is he so nice to her?" 

"Who knows? Are they relatives?" 

"Why do I feel like they might like each other?" 

"No way! How could Mr. Landon like a simple girl like Isabella?"

"Could be. After all, everyone likes college girls, they're innocent enough."

"But isn't office romance prohibited in the company?"

"Excuse me! That's Mr. Landon we're talking about! He set the company's regulations to restrain the employees, but Mr. Landon is exempt from that."

Laura did not participate in the discussion, but instead took a photo with her phone and quickly sent it to Vanessa. She was used to sharing her experiences with Vanessa, even though Vanessa had already resigned. After sending her the photo, she also sent a bunch of texts.

Vanessa looked at the texts jealously. Instead of replying to Laura, she called Sebastian.

Sebastian's phone rang.

He picked it up and glanced at it, then walked to the window to answer the call. "Hello?"

On the other end of the phone, Vanessa said, "Are you coming back for lunch, Mr. Landon?"

"I already had lunch at the company. I'm not coming back. What's up?"

"Alright then, it's nothing. I was just asking if you had lunch. I thought you would come back for lunch, so I made a lot of food... But since you already had lunch, forget it."

"Okay." Sebastian frowned. He remembered telling Vanessa in the morning that he had a dinner engagement and would be back late. Had she not understood what he said? Had she really made a table full of food for lunch?

"You should have more with grandma," Sebastian said.

"Okay." Vanessa pretended to obey him.

After hanging up the phone, Vanessa's smile gradually disappeared. She returned to the chat with Laura and opened the photo Laura sent. Her jealous eyes started to burn.

After some thought, Vanessa saved the photo and anonymously entered the company group chat. She sent the photo to all the groups and then exited the group chat, ensuring her own identity would not be discovered.


In less than half a day, Isabella became the subject of public criticism. Wherever she went, people were talking about her.

Even when she went to the restroom, she could hear negative comments about herself.

"Does Mr. Landon really like that Isabella? I went to the president's office to see her, and she's not that pretty! She looks so young, would Mr. Landon like that type of girl?"

"Don't judge a book by its cover. You think she looks young, but she might actually be very cunning."

"That's right. If she can seduce Mr. Landon, she must have some ulterior motives!"

"She's really smart. If I were that cunning, I wouldn't have to work so hard."

Isabella, who was in the small cubicle, was speechless.

Over the course of one afternoon, Isabella heard similar debates at least ten times. Since she had heard them, Sebastian probably knew about it too. She waited for Sebastian to clarify what was going on, but he didn't react until the end of the workday.

Could it be... that he didn't know about this?

It was impossible. Even if he hadn't read the company group message, this had spread so widely that Jack would have told him.

This was about his reputation. He would definitely clarify things.

Isabella was confused, so she waited outside the company door when she got off work.

When she saw Sebastian's car approaching, she walked up briskly and raised her hand to stop him.

She felt that what she was doing was a bit childish, but she didn't expect the car to actually slow down in front of her.
###chapter 28 She is Somewhat Different
The car window rolled down, revealing Sebastian's face. "Isabella? Why haven't you gone home yet?"

Isabella didn't know why, but she felt that Sebastian was particularly gentle every time he called her name,.

She suppressed the strange feeling in her heart and said, "Mr. Landon, do you know about the photo in the company group chat?"

"Are you talking about the photo that someone secretly took of us while we were eating in the restaurant at noon?"

"Yes."

"I saw it. What's wrong?" Sebastian looked at her small face that was about the size of his hand. "Did that photo give you trouble?"

Isabella felt embarrassed. After all, he was the CEO of the company, and he wasn't worried, so how could she, a junior employee, be worried?

"No..." Isabella shook her head. "I was just afraid it would trouble you."

"You don't need to worry about it. We know we're innocent, so it's enough," he said.

Thoe words instantly made Isabella understand. Yes, if we know we're innocent, it's enough. Sometimes, the more you rushed to prove yourself, the more likely you would fail. The rumors would naturally go away over time, so why bother making yourself feel uncomfortable?

The wind blew, mixed with a few raindrops. Sebastian looked up at the black sky and said, "This isn't a good time to get a taxi. Come on, I'll give you a ride home."

"No." Isabella shook her hands repeatedly, "I'll head home, Mr. Landon, goodbye."

After saying that, she quickly ran away, as if she was afraid that Sebastian would pull her into the car.

Jack chuckled and said, "Anyone else would be eager to establish a relationship with you, but Isabella is an exception."

Sebastian only turned his gaze away when Isabella's figure completely disappeared. "Yes, she's different."

Before Jack could savor the meaning of that sentence, Sebastian said, "Let's go."

Isabella boarded the subway and thought to herself, 'If Sebastian doesn't clarify things, should I do it?' But she was just an employee. Even if she did make a statement, it probably wouldn't have much effect...

She entered the company group chat hesitantly, but as soon as Isabella entered, a new message came in.

Mr. Landon: [I hope everyone will stop forwarding the photos that were circulating in the group today.]

There were also similar messages in the other company group chats, indicating that he had sent them to all the groups.

He had really clarified the situation. Was it because of what she said?

Isabella looked at the message, feeling a warmth inside.

The next morning, Isabella was still in the bathroom getting ready when she heard some noises outside.

When she finished washing up and came out, she saw Samantha preparing breakfast. When Samantha saw her, she immediately smiled and said, "I brought breakfast for you, Bella. It's your favorite bread, come and try it."

Isabella walked straight past her, opened the closet to get her clothes, and said, "I don't like it anymore."

Samantha was taken aback but continued to smile and said, "What do you like now? Tell me, I'll go buy it."

Isabella stopped searching for her clothes, turned to look at Samantha, and asked, "What are you up to?"

She had been tricked once before, she would never fall into the same trap twice. She was now wary of Samantha.

"Why are you looking at me like that, Bella?" Samantha's smile was a bit strained. "I don't want anything. I just want to sincerely apologize to you and make things right between us..."

Isabella interrupted her. "If I took something from you, would you still be friends with me?"

Samantha was momentarily stunned, then smiled and said, "Of course. We're good friends. What's mine is yours. If you want something, you don't have to steal it, just let me know and I'll gladly offer it to you."

"Good." Isabella smiled faintly. "I want you to break up with Matthew."

"Bella, even if I break up with Matthew now, you two can't be together..."

"What? Are you saying you can't do it?" Isabella didn't give her a chance to speak nonsense. "If you can't do it, then don't put on a show in front of me. You're behaving badly, and I don't want to see it."

Isabella changed her clothes, picked up her bag, ignored Samantha's stiff expression, and walked out the door.

Samantha stomped her feet and threw the breakfast into the trash can. "Why are you so proud, Isabella? Once I'm in the CEO's office at the Landon Group, you won't be able to act like this."

On the subway, Isabella gathered the balances of several cards together, but it came up to only ten dollars. She hesitated, thinking about whether she should borrow a hundred dollars from Nina. After all, she didn't want to owe Sebastian for too long. She needed to repay him as soon as possible to ease her burden.

Isabella silently encouraged herself for a long time before mustering the courage to dial Nina's phone number.

After two rings, Nina answered the call. "Hey, Bella. What's up? Why are you calling me so early?"

"It's nothing, I just... I miss you," Isabella bit her lip, feeling a tinge of sadness.

"Did something happen?" Nina asked.

Before she could reply, Charlie's voice came from beside Nina. "Who is it?"

"It's Bella."

"Did she come to her senses? Is she going to help me collaborate with the Landon Group?"

"No..."

"Then why is she calling?" Charlie's tone was full of contempt.

Nina felt hurt by his words, covered the phone, and walked aside, saying, "Bella, is something going on with you? You can tell me."

"It's nothing," Isabella couldn't bring herself to say it at that moment.

If she did, Nina would definitely send her money. But once Charlie found out, they would argue again. Isabella had moved out of Nina's house in because she wanted to be independent and not burden Nina anymore. So she put on a smile and spoke lightly. "Really, it's nothing. I just had a dream about you last night, so I wanted to give you a call."

"Are you really okay?" Nina still wasn't reassured. "Bella, if you need anything, you have to tell me. You can't bear everything on your own, you know?"

"Okay. I know," Isabella intentionally changed the subject to ease her worries. "Where are you? It sounds a bit noisy over there."

"Oh... I'm at the hospital."

Isabella became nervous. "The hospital? Are you sick?"

"No, I'm just getting a check-up, it's a normal physical examination. I'm perfectly fine." Nina's tone remained cheerful.

They chatted a bit more until Charlie grew impatient and urged them to end the call.

"It's our turn," Charlie said, grabbing Nina's hand and leading her toward the outpatient department. He reminded her, "Remember, answer the doctor's questions honestly. I suspect there's something wrong with your body, otherwise, why haven't you gotten pregnant after such a long time?"

"Okay," Nina nodded, following behind him. As she thought of Isabella, she felt uneasy and secretly transferred $200 to her using her phone.

Ding ding.

When Isabella picked up her phone and saw the $200 that Nina had transferred her, tears welled up in her eyes.

Isabella didn't accept the $200 because she didn't want to embarrass Nina. After returning the money, she sent a few voice messages to Nina, telling her that she was really okay and that she would treat her to a nice meal once she got her paycheck.

Nina replied with a smile, saying, "Okay."
###chapter 29 I Didn't Expect You to Have Such a Hot Figure
During lunch, Isabella took her bread and water to the stairwell. She mainly did this to avoid the possibility of Sebastian taking her to the cafeteria like he did yesterday.

No one usually came to the stairwell, so it was quiet. Isabella ate her bread and flipped through the contacts in her phone. After going through them twice, she realized that there wasn't anyone she could ask for money.

There were many messages in the classmates' group chat. Isabella was usually quiet and never sent anything there. She had only joined the group chat because Samantha had invited her, but she wasn't really interested, so she immediately muted the group messages. However, for some reason, she clicked on it now.

There were a lot of messages, so Isabella calmly scrolled up. As she looked, she suddenly stopped. What caught her eye was a classmate who had shared her income, talking about how she could earn two hundred dollars in one night doing part-time work. She asked if anyone who needed money would be willing to work with her.

That classmate's name was Miley. She was one of the best-looking students in the department, and she was also popular because of her outgoing personality. But when one door opens, another door closes. Miley didn't have good grades and didn't take her studies seriously. Most of her time and energy were spent on dressing up and socializing, so she failed many courses every semester. Almost every teacher had a negative opinion of her. 

One time, someone saw Miley getting out of a luxury car, so rumors started spreading that she was involved in shady activities. When someone asked her about it, she didn't explain and didn't care as the rumors spread more and more. The school almost expelled her...

Compared to Miley, Isabella was a quiet girl. She didn't talk much, just buried herself in books. The teachers thought she was a good student and her classmates thought she was a good person.

Isabella clicked on Miley's profile picture and hesitated for a long time before finally sending a friend request. However, there was no response until it was almost time to get off work, when Isabella finally received her acceptance.

[You are now friends. Let's chat!]

As Isabelle looked at the small text on the screen, she wondered what her opening line should be. After all, she and Miley didn't really know each other. Even though they had been classmates, they had never spoken to each other. She hadn't thought about what to say yet when Miley sent the first message: [Are you looking for a part-time job?]

Isabella blushed. She hadn't expected her to be so straightforward. [Yes, do you have one?]

Miley: [Do you need money desperately?]

Isabella: [Yes.]

Afraid that Miley would think she was a woman of few words, she quickly added, [I really need money.]

Miley sent a location and said, [You can come over tonight, I'll show you and then you can decide.]

Isabella hadn't expected things to go so smoothly. Miley hadn't said anything unnecessary, which relieved her anxiety. So she quickly replied, [Okay, I'll be there on time.]

--

Sebastian and Jack were not in the office all day today, so everyone was relaxed. When it was time to leave and go home, Isabella packed up her things, ready to leave at any moment. But as she stood up to leave, Laura threw a stack of documents at her. "Isabella, organize those materials and make a table. We'll need it for the meeting tomorrow morning."

After speaking, she didn't even glance at Isabella and walked away.

"Wait..." Isabella called after her. "I'm sorry, but I have something very important to do tonight, so I can't do this..."

Laura raised an eyebrow. "Do you have something more important than work? Don't think that you're special just because Mr. Landon spoke up for you, Isabella. Everyone here started as interns. Mr. Landon promoted you ahead of the others just because you know how to please the boss. But even if you were promoted, you're still just a member of the assistant department. What makes you think you're special?"

"I don't think I'm special," Isabella defended herself quietly. "I really do have something very important to do tonight. I can leave the materials here and come back to do them tomorrow morning."

Laura raised an eyebrow. "Fine! I don't care when you do it. I'm just telling you, we have an early meeting at 8:30 tomorrow morning and we need this table. If you haven't done it by then, don't make any excuses."

Isabella nodded. "Thank you."

Laura rolled her eyes and walked away.

Isabella didn't delay any longer and quickly went to see Miley.

As she saw the luxurious high-end entertainment club in front of her, her newfound ambition disappeared again...

"What's wrong? Are you scared now?" Miley stood beside her, smiling. "It's easy to make money from rich people. If you can't handle it, you can just leave."

After saying that, Miley didn't say much more and walked inside.

Isabella watched her and felt conflicted. As Miley was about to disappear from her sight, Isabella gritted her teeth and hurriedly followed.

Following Miley through the employee passage, they entered a dressing room. Some women were already changing clothes and putting on makeup inside. When they saw Miley, they greeted her warmly. Then they noticed Isabella, who was following closely behind her, and said with a smile, "Miley, children aren't allowed in the club."

Isabella remained silent.

Did she really look like a child?

She might be wearing slightly childish clothes, but it didn't mean she looked like a child.

Miley chuckled. "This is my classmate."

"Your classmate looks very young." Several girls laughed and teased Isabella, while she stood there uncertainly, her face turning as red as an apple.

Miley opened the cabinet and took out two sets of clothes, throwing one set to Isabella. "Change into that. Amber took a leave of absence today, so you can fill in for her tonight and see if you can get used to it. If you can, I'll take you to meet the manager tomorrow and have her arrange something for you."

Isabella lowered her head and realized that she was holding a waitress uniform, completely different from the sexy dresses Miley and the others wore.

Isabella breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that Miley wasn't bad. She looked around and asked, "Where should I change?"

Miley had already taken off her clothes and started putting on the dress, her graceful figure fully exposed in front of Isabella. Even though she was a girl, Isabella found Miley very sexy. Miley turned around, glanced at her, and smiled. "This is the changing room"

Isabella bit her lip, uncertain about undressing with so many people around.

Miley raised an eyebrow. "If you feel embarrassed about this, how will you get tips from customers later?"

Isabella was speechless at that question.

"I'll change now." Isabella turned around and started changing.

When she took off her outerwear and turned around, she found Miley staring at her. Instead of avoiding eye contact, Miley smiled mischievously, her red lips curling up. "You look skinny, Isabella. I didn't expect you to have such a hot figure."

Isabella's cheeks instantly grew hot.
###chapter 30 Desperate for Money
After they changed, Miley led her outside. They were in a luxurious hallway with the scent of money lingering in the air, different to the dim employee corridor.

Isabella was extremely nervous. She felt thrilled as if she was a child sneaking into an internet cafe to play games without her parents' knowledge.

At the door, Miley reached out to knock, while turning her head to advise Isabella, "You need to be quick-witted later. Remember to say nice things. If someone gives you a tip, take it. Don't be shy."

Isabella listened attentively and nodded, indicating she understood. Although she had already mentally prepared herself, she couldn't help but feel nervous when the door opened. She kept her head down, afraid to look at anyone, and simply followed Miley's footsteps, afraid of being left behind.

"Shy assistant?" a voice sounded above her head, tinged with a hint of confusion and teasing.

Isabella was taken aback and looked up to see Zaire's smiling face.

"It really is you, huh?" Zaire seemed excited when he saw her. Without waiting for Isabella to say anything, he turned to his other side and said, "This waiter looks like your shy assistant, Mr. Landon."

Isabella felt as if she was frozen in place. She stiffly turned her head, following Zaire's gaze, and she saw Sebastian. In that moment of eye contact, Isabella's mind was struck by a bolt of thunder and she felt as if her world was about to shatter.

How would you feel if you secretly took on a part-time job behind the boss's back and got caught? You would feel as if you wanted to die.

Zaire reached out and tugged at her sleeve. "I'm talking to you. Why aren't you saying anything? Aren't you an employee of the Landon Group? How did you end up here... as a waitress? Don't you know that the Landon Group prohibits its regular employees from having part-time jobs?"

Isabella was shocked. She had been anxious about finding a part-time job and earning money and had completely forgotten about the Landon Group's regulations. Now, prompted by Zaire's reminder, she realized she had made a big mistake!

Isabella lowered her head, weakly saying, "You're mistaken. I'm a waitress here, I'm Amber."

Zaire raised an eyebrow, looking at Sebastian.

Sebastian simply glanced at Isabella, and then calmly said, "She does look like the shy assistant."

This indirectly denied Zaire's speculation.

"After a closer look, I suppose they really don't look alike." Zaire stared at Isabella intently, then tapped the table with his finger. "Come here and pour me a drink."

Isabella silently walked over and filled a glass for Zaire.

Zaire looked at the glass, a little dissatisfied as he said, "I can't hold my liquor. Are you trying to get me drunk by pouring so much for me?"

Isabella felt a bit anxious.

She was a newcomer to the workplace and it was her first time working as a waitress, so she was a bit at a loss in this situation.

"Mr. Jose." Miley walked over, lightly resting her arm on Zaire's shoulder, her soft body leaning against him. She held a glass of wine and clinked glasses with Zaire, making a crisp sound. "Can't you hold your alcohol, Mr. Jose? Why are you being modest today? Here, I'll drink with you."

As she spoke, she lifted her glass and handed it to Zaire, saying, "I'll go first. You can have as much as you want, Mr. Jose."

She tilted her head back and finished a shot.

Zaire glanced at Miley's snow-white delicate neck and narrowed his eyes. "I'll drink with you."

With that, he also tilted his head back and downed the contents of his glass.

Miley took the opportunity to give Isabella a signal, so Isabella quickly left. She stood by the door with a few other waiters, waiting to go over if anyone needed service.

Miley stayed with Zaire the whole time. They drank as if it were water and had a great time.

At first, Isabella was worried about Miley, thinking that she would get drunk later. It turned out that Isabella had underestimated Miley. Miley drank a lot, but her face never turned red.

Isabella gradually let go of her concerns. She looked around and finally saw Sebastian. He had been sitting there the whole time. Despite the chaos in the private room, he seemed unaffected, as if he couldn't blend into the lively atmosphere. If someone talked to him, he would respond politely, but he wouldn't initiate conversations with anyone else. He just quietly drank by himself.

Isabella looked at him and felt that he seemed quite lonely.

Just then, a charming woman appeared beside him. A girl in the pink dress approached him, blushing. She held a glass of wine and wanted to drink with him. However, she didn't hold the glass steady, which caused her drink to spill onto Sebastian's white shirt.

"Sorry, Mr. Landon. I've stained your clothes. Let me help you clean it..." Although she apologized, her expression showed that she did it intentionally. She took out a few tissues and started wiping Sebastian. It seemed like she was removing the stain, but in reality, she was touching Sebastian. Her beautiful pink nails traced circles on Sebastian's chest. She looked at him affectionately. All her desires were written on her face. If Sebastian said the word, she would undress herself and spend a passionate night with him.

For some reason, Isabella found that scene quite annoying. She was someone who liked peace, but at that moment, she wanted to step forward and push that woman away, keeping her far from Sebastian.

Suddenly, Sebastian grabbed the woman's wrist. Taking advantage of his strength, the woman leaned onto him.

Isabella suddenly remembered how Sebastian had acted so desperately with her that night. The thought of Sebastian doing the same with someone else made her heart ache.

As she was about to turn away, she saw Sebastian push the woman away and stand up, saying, "Stay away from me."

He walked out.

The woman pouted but was undeterred. She turned to please another man.

A few minutes later, Isabella walked out of the private room. In the dimly lit, long corridor, she spotted Sebastian smoking by the window at the end of the hallway. After a moment of hesitation, Isabella approached him.

When Sebastian heard footsteps, he turned his head, frowning when he saw her. He extinguished the cigarette, tossing the butt into the trash can.

Isabella always felt nervous when she faced him. "Mr. Landon," she said.

Sebastian, looking at the top of her head, spoke earnestly, "Don't you want to work at the Landon Group anymore?"

Feeling flustered, Isabella hurriedly replied, "No... I... I..."

She didn't know how to explain it to him. Everyone had empathy, but she didn't expect Sebastian, as the boss, to understand a lowly employee like her. And working part-time did violate company regulations. The more she said, the more it sounded like she was making excuses.

Isabella's eyes reddened with anxiety. She bit her lip and didn't know what to say.

Sebastian's heart softened when he saw her teary eyes He pulled out another cigarette, lit it, took a few puffs, his voice slightly hoarse. "Do you need money?"
###chapter 31 With Me Around, You Can Rest Assured
Isabella nodded and said, "I do."

Sebastian looked at her and continued, "Is your salary not enough for your daily expenses?" His tone was heavy.

"No..." Isabella didn't dare say that her salary was not enough. 

In fact, if it Charlie hadn't skipped out on the bill that night, she wouldn't have been in such a tight spot and had to take on a part-time job. 

But there had been twists and turns, and she didn't want to say too much, especially not to her boss, Sebastian.

Sebastian looked at her and continued, "Give me an explanation." 

Isabella hesitated and said, "I just moved out of my sister's place, and I've run out of money. Plus, I still owe you one hundred dollars from last time. It's still half a month away from payday, so that's why I..."

"What did I tell you when I lent you money last time?" Sebastian interrupted.

Isabella looked confused.

Looking at her innocent eyes, Sebastian felt both angry and amused. "You've forgotten so quickly?" 

Isabella shook her head. "I haven't forgotten..."

At that time, Sebastian had said that if she didn't have enough money, she could come to him for more. But she thought he was just being polite. She hadn't thought he was serious.

"Do you still want to borrow money from me?" Isabella couldn't believe it.

Sebastian didn't say much. He just took out his phone and transferred four hundred dollars to her. Then he asked, "Is that enough?"

Isabella was stunned. She looked at the money and hesitated to accept it.

Sebastian said, "Consider this a loan from me, or you can think of it as an advance on your salary. This job here doesn't suit you, so you shouldn't come here again."

Isabella felt like crying a little and said, "Thank you, Mr. Landon."

"Do you really want to thank me?" Sebastian asked seriously.

Isabella blinked, not understanding what he meant.

"Do you know how to drive?" 

"I do," Isabella replied.

Sebastian handed her the car keys. "Jack's not here today. I had some drinks, so I can't drive. Can you give me a ride back?" 

Isabella felt grateful toward him, so she didn't refuse that small favor. She took the car keys and followed him. 

While they waited for the elevator, Sebastian glanced at her. "Aren't you going to change?" 

Isabella lowered her head and realized that she was still wearing her work uniform from the club. She felt embarrassed and said, "I'll go change." 

Sebastian didn't say anything. He was always particularly gentle with her. 

Isabella returned to the changing room and changed. She also texted Miley, expressing that she couldn't handle the job and was going home. She thanked Miley for everything. 

Miley replied: [Alright.] 

Isabella retraced her steps and found out that Sebastian hadn't left. He was still waiting for her in the same spot. 

"Mr. Landon." As Isabella approached him, he pressed the elevator button. His gaze naturally swept over Isabella. "You look best in your own clothes." 

Isabella's cheeks felt hot. "I think I'm most comfortable in my own clothes too." 

--------
The elevator arrived.

Sebastian entered the elevator first, and Isabella followed closely behind. After descending a few floors, the elevator stopped, and a couple in love rushed in, kissing passionately without caring about anyone else. 

The elevator was surrounded by mirrors. Even the floor was mirrored, so if Isabella lowered her head, she could still see them kissing intensely. Even if she closed her eyes, she was forced to hear the sound of their kissing. 

"Baby, your lips are so soft..." 

"Be gentle..." 

Isabella noticed Sebastian loosening his collar, frowning, looking somewhat unhappy. 

Isabella couldn't help but cough, wanting to remind that passionate couple that other people were in the elevator. 

But it seemed like they hadn't heard her. Their actions became even more intense. With a loud bang, the man forcefully pushed the woman against the wall. 

The man's big hand caressed the woman's fair legs and lifted up her short skirt. 

Isabella was stunned! 

Suddenly, a hand reached over and gently covered her eyes. Sebastian's voice spoke near her ear, "Are you still watching them?" 

Isabella saw him extending his other hand and pressing the button for the nearest floor. 

When the elevator doors opened, Sebastian pulled her by the arm and led her out of the elevator. 

"Are you okay?" Sebastian asked. 

Isabella's heart was still racing. She shook her head, feeling a bit dazed. "I'm fine."

Sebastian, however, smiled at her and asked, "Why are you blushing?" Isabella panicked and quickly covered her own cheeks with her hands. It was quite warm, mainly because the scene just now had shocked her. Plus, she was with Sebastian. It was as if they had watched a pornographic film together... Isabella felt very shy. 

As Sebastian stood behind her, he lowered his head and saw her blushing ear lobes. Suddenly, he became a little nervous. 

In the parking lot, Sebastian opened the back door and got in, while Isabella sat in the driver's seat. She carefully started the car and drove away. 

She drove cautiously while Sebastian sat in the back seat, closing his eyes and resting. Isabella had obtained her driver's license when she was in college, so she would have an additional skill for future job prospects. However, this was the first time she had driven since getting her license. And she was driving her boss's car, with the boss in it.

If something happened to this car, she wouldn't be able to afford to pay for it. Isabella felt a lot of pressure. She gripped the steering wheel tightly and drove extra carefully. 

If she accidentally scraped this car, she definitely wouldn't have the money to pay for repairs. 

But the more cautious she was, the more the cars behind her honked impatiently at her. That made Isabella even more nervous. 

Sebastian opened his eyes and quietly watched her for a while before speaking. "You don't have to be nervous." Isabella nodded but still felt anxious. 

A few seconds later, Sebastian said, "Find a place to park by the side of the road." Isabella sensed something was off in his voice, so she quickly signaled and parked on the side of the road. When the car came to a stop, Sebastian got out. Curiously, Isabella looked over and saw him opening the front passenger door. He got in and fastened his seatbelt before adjusting the seat to a more comfortable position. He glanced at Isabella and then said, "If you have an experienced driver like me sitting next to you, you can relax and drive." 

Isabella was somewhat surprised. He had purposely switched seats to act as her guide. Her heart was filled with a sense of security, and she relaxed a little. 

Following the navigation instructions, Isabella drove the car to Sebastian's mansion. When Vanessa heard the sound of the car, she ran out happily. "Mr. Landon, you're back? Isabella, you're here too?"

"Mr. Landon was drinking, so I brought him back," Isabella said, wondering to herself, 'Vanessa is no longer an employee of the Landon Group, so why does she still call him Mr. Landon at home? That makes them sound so distant, not at all like a couple who have been secretly dating for a year.'

"Really? Thank you, Isabella," Vanessa said, smiling as she took Sebastian's arm.

Sebastian frowned and discreetly pulled his hand away, saying to Isabella, "It's late now, so you can drive my car back to your place. Just take it to the company tomorrow morning."

Isabella was taken aback.

Vanessa's smile froze.
###chapter 32 I Don't Feel Anything for You
The only person at the company who had the privilege of driving Sebastian's car back home was Jack.

This honor had never been bestowed on Vanessa, who had worked at the company for over a year, let alone Isabella, the newcomer.

Isabella shook her head, placing the car keys on the hood. "Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Landon. I'll just take a taxi back. Goodbye, Mr. Landon."

After saying that, she nodded at Vanessa and turned to leave.

Watching Isabella's back, Vanessa asked, "How did Isabella end up with you? Did you take her to meet clients tonight?"

Sebastian glanced at her and replied, "She's my employee and my assistant. Is there a problem with me taking her to meet clients?"

Vanessa started to feel flustered by his response. "I didn't mean anything else. I just wanted to show my concern for you..."

"Someone posted a photo in the company's internal group yesterday, causing quite a stir. Did you know about this?" Sebastian changed the subject so quickly that Vanessa couldn't keep up.

"A photo?" Vanessa feigned ignorance.

Sebastian scrutinized her. "I had Jack look into it. He found that the anonymous account that posted the photo resembled your previous one."

"That's impossible!" Vanessa panicked. "I left the company's group chat. If you don't believe me, look..."

She took out her phone, opened the app, and showed it to Sebastian.

However, Sebastian didn't even bother to look, just saying, "It better not to be you."

Those words caused Vanessa to break out in a cold sweat.

Sebastian went upstairs. Vanessa, on the other hand, went to the kitchen and took out the midnight snack she had carefully prepared, intending to please Sebastian. But as soon as she reached the second floor, Zoe came out.

Zoe had a keen sense of smell. She sniffed the air and asked, "What are you holding?"

"This is a midnight snack I made for Sebastian, Grandma."

"Is it? Let me see."

Vanessa certainly wouldn't miss an opportunity to show off. She immediately handed the food to Zoe to inspect.

"It looks good," Zoe commented briefly, then said, "Bring it to my room. I'm hungry."

Vanessa was stunned. "Grandma, I made this midnight snack for Sebastian..."

"Sebastian never eats midnight snacks," Zoe said, "If you don't want to give it to me, then give it to Sebastian first, and I'll ask him for it later."

Vanessa didn't know how to respond.

Sebastian respected and cared for Zoe deeply. It wouldn't be good if she did that. Vanessa gritted her teeth and reluctantly took the midnight snack to Zoe's room. Then she went to see Sebastian.

Sebastian was on the phone. On the other end of the line, Zaire was drunk and speaking incoherently. "Sebastian, you know, our relationship is so good, so do you think of my sister Kelsey as your sister?"

Sebastian turned on the speakerphone and tossed his phone aside. He stood next to the phone, wiping the water from his hair with a towel, and answered expressionlessly, "No."

"I don't care. If you won't agree to let Kelsey be your assistant, I'll take her to jump off the Landon Group building tomorrow!"

Sebastian replied, "Alright! I'll have someone prepare a VIP channel for you to make your way there faster."

Zaire was completely speechless. "How could Kelsey like you? You're such an old-fashioned guy. It's so annoying."

Sebastian picked up his phone. "Take care of her. She's your sister."

"I..."

Zaire's words were cut off as the call was disconnected.

Sebastian turned around and stared at Vanessa, who was eavesdropping at the door. "Did you need something?"

Sebastian had just finished showering, so there was still moisture on his body. His hair was casually swept across his forehead, which made him look very attractive. Vanessa wanted to get close to him, so she deliberately approached him. "I can't sleep, so I wanted to come and talk to you."

Sebastian frowned. "What do you want to talk about?"

Vanessa bit her lip. She knew that she had to fight for herself, so she approached Sebastian and hugged his waist. She tiptoed and whispered, "Mr. Landon, the night is still young... I want..."

The sudden ringing of the phone interrupted Vanessa. When the phone rang, Sebastian pushed her away. Sebastian took a few steps toward the window and said, "Have her come for an interview tomorrow. You can't say I didn't give her a chance."

As soon as he hung up the phone, Vanessa walked over and hugged him tightly from behind. "I'm so cold, Mr. Landon. Can you hold me?"

Sebastian pried her fingers open and pushed her away. He looked at Vanessa and said, "I'm sorry, but I don't feel anything for you."

Vanessa froze. She looked at him sadly and said, "But that night, we..."

"That night, I had too much to drink, which led to the absurd act of sleeping with you," Sebastian said calmly.

"Then why did you accept me and let me move in?"

"I made a mistake. I can't change the outcome. You lost your virginity because of me, so I needed to compensate you," Sebastian said. "If you don't want this compensation anymore one day, just tell me. I'll give you some money."

Vanessa bit her lip. "I'm not leaving! I've made up my mind that I like you, Mr. Landon, so I'll follow you for the rest of my life. Don't even think about kicking me out."

After saying that, Vanessa left his room.

Sebastian felt a headache coming on. He walked to the bedside table and took out the bracelet, gently caressing it.

Suddenly, Isabella's blushing face appeared in his mind. And the "erotic live show" he saw in the elevator made Sebastian suddenly get a boner.

He threw the bracelet into the drawer with a grim expression.

He lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

He couldn't fall asleep.

After thinking for a while, Sebastian took out his phone, found Isabella's account, and sent her a message.

Isabella had just gotten out of the car. To save money, she had chosen to walk back to her school from the subway station. Suddenly, her phone beeped, and Isabella took it out and looked at it, stopping in her tracks.

Sebastian asked, [Are you home?]

That short sentence made her feel warm.

Isabella typed, [I'll be home in a moment.]

She looked up and saw many stars in the sky. She couldn't help but take a few pictures and sent the two best ones to Sebastian.

A few minutes later, Sebastian replied, [It's beautiful.]

He sent her another picture he had taken of the starry sky.

As Isabella read the message, she couldn't help but smile foolishly, then she saved that picture.

As she was about to take out her keys to open the door, her phone rang again. Isabella thought it was Sebastian, but when she took out her phone, she realized it was Nina.
###chapter 33 Zero and Countless Times
Isabella dropped her keys on the ground as her hand trembled while opening the door. She asked, her voice trembling, "What happened to her?"

"Come to the hospital quickly. Nina's going to die," Charlie said urgently over the phone before hanging up.

--

When Isabella arrived at the hospital, she saw Charlie sitting alone on a chair outside the emergency room, hanging his head as if he had made a huge mistake. Isabella walked up to him. "Charlie, where's Nina?"

Charlie raised his head and motioned toward the emergency room. Isabella leaned against the door but couldn't see anything. Worried, she asked, "What happened to her?"

"Nothing... she's fine," Charlie stuttered, avoiding eye contact. "We had an argument and then..."

"You hit her?" Isabella could smell the strong scent of alcohol on Charlie's body. Her eyes widened.

"No... I just pushed her and she hit the handle of the cabinet. She was bleeding, but I don't think it's a big deal..."

"It's not a big deal?" Isabella clenched her teeth and trembled with anger. "If something happens to Nina, I won't forgive you."

Charlie was genuinely frightened as he witnessed this side of Isabella for the first time,. 

At that moment, the door to the emergency room opened and a nurse pushed out a bed. Isabella was the first to go toward the bed. When she saw Nina lying there with her pale face, eyes closed, tears almost welled up in her own eyes.

"How is she, Doctor?" Isabella unintentionally lowered her voice.

"Fortunately, she was brought in promptly and none of her vital areas were hit. If it had been a bit off, she might not have been so fortunate. She's fine now. You just need to wait for her to regain consciousness," the doctor reassured her.

"Thank you," Isabella expressed gratitude while still feeling a bit frightened. Nina was her only family in this world. If she lost Nina, she wouldn't be able to go on. The fear and helplessness she felt outside the emergency room was something she never wanted to experience again in her lifetime.

"She's fine," Charlie relaxed. "I told you she'd be fine. It was just a minor bump..."

Isabella turned around and glared at him. Charlie, feeling guilty, didn't say anything more and obediently came forward to push the hospital bed.

When they arrived at the ward, Isabella took care of everything herself. Charlie tried to approach Nina several times, but Isabella drove him away. She helped Nina wipe her face and hands. As she looked at Nina's sleeping face, her nose tingled. When she turned and saw Charlie lying on the couch, snoring soundly, she bit her lip hard and made up her mind.

Isabella stayed by Nina's side all night. The next morning, Isabella felt a gentle touch on her head. When she opened her eyes, she met Nina's loving gaze.

"Nina," Isabella said, holding Nina's hand. "You're awake? Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something? I'll go buy it."

Nina shook her head, "Why are you here?"

"Charlie called me."

As Isabella finished speaking, Charlie entered the room with breakfast. "Nina, you're awake? I bought breakfast for you guys. The breakfast shop downstairs is busy. I had to line up for ten minutes. Come and eat quickly."

When he handed the food to Isabella, she didn't take it.

Charlie froze and looked at Nina.

"Bella?" Nina nudged Isabella's hand, signaling her to take the food.

Reluctantly, Isabella obeyed Nina and took the food.

"I have some work to do, so I'm leaving. Please spend more time with Nina, Bella. I'll come over after work," Charlie said as he grabbed his coat and hurriedly left.

The ward fell silent. Nina asked in concern, "What's wrong with you, Bella?"

Isabella stared at the sandwich in her hand. After a long time, she asked, "Are you happy, Nina?"

Nina was startled for a moment, then smiled, "I'm pretty happy. We went through some tough times. Looking back, I don't even know how we managed to get through that. But it's all in the past now. Everything is good now."

"Really?" Isabella's eyes turned red, "Ever since you married Charlie, I haven't seen you smile."

"What nonsense are you saying? I'm smiling right now, aren't I?"

Isabella felt a pang in her heart. She held Nina's hand and firmly said, "Nina, you should get a divorce."

Nina was taken aback because that was something Isabella would never say. "Bella, you..."

"I know you chose to marry Charlie to give me a home and someone else to rely on. But I've seen you become less and less happy these past few years. I've found a job now, so you don't have to work as hard as before. Get a divorce."

Nina felt conflicted. "But..."

Nina, domestic violence should only happen once," Isabella said, tightening her grip on Nina's hand, her eyes more determined than ever. She knew that if she held onto this idea firmly, she could give Nina the confidence and strength she needed.

"I... I'll think about it," Nina said, avoiding Isabella's gaze. "You should go have breakfast."

After breakfast, Nina urged Isabella to hurry to work. When Isabella saw that she was in good spirits, she suggested that she come to the hospital to keep her company during lunch break. Then Isabella squeezed onto a crowded bus to go to work. As soon as she arrived, Laura blocked her path. "The morning meeting is about to start, Isabella. Where are the files you organized?"

Isabella was taken aback, then remembered what happened yesterday. "I'll do it right now..."

Laura snatched the files away. "Right now? Are you saying that everyone should wait for you?"

Isabella didn't know what to say.

"Do you remember what you told me yesterday, Isabella? You said you had something important to do last night, so you would come to the office early today to finish it. And now, the meeting can't start because of you. Are you willing to take responsibility?"

"I..."

"Isabella was with me yesterday evening, meeting a client," Sebastian said, stepping out of the elevator. He was dressed in a black suit and exuded a cold aura. He walked straight over, glanced at the documents on the table, and said to Laura, "I plan to assign Isabella to work with Mr. Williams, so she won't have to handle these miscellaneous tasks anymore."

"Why?" Laura retorted, her tone rising involuntarily. "You've always been fair to every employee, Mr. Landon. But why are you always defending Isabella? It's unfair to the rest of us."

Jack sternly said, "Watch your words, Laura!"

"What's wrong? I'm telling the truth. She's the newest member of the office. Mr. Landon promoted her to a regular employee against the norm before, and now she's making mistakes, but he keeps protecting her. If we don't assign these miscellaneous tasks to her, who will do them? I just don't understand. Mr. Landon. I hope you can give us a clear answer."

After Laura finished speaking, everyone else looked over. In fact, they were all puzzled because Isabella had always been low-profile. Why was she suddenly getting special attention from Sebastian?
###chapter 34 What? Are you scared now?
Isabella hadn't expected things to escalate like this. As she was about to explain, she heard Sebastian calmly say, "Do I still need to report my work to you?"

There was a hint of threat in his tone.

"That's not what I meant, Mr. Landon. I just wanted to fight for fair benefits for everyone..."

"I chose Isabella because I saw her excellent qualities. It's up to me to decide what work to give her and whether or not to protect her. Your job is to focus on your own work, not to gossip and teach your boss how to do his job." 

Laura was infuriated by that remark. The others lowered their heads and didn't dare not say anything.

Sebastian turned to Jack and said, "We have a new employee coming in today, right? Move Isabella's desk to my office. I'll be in charge of her work from now on." 

Laura looked up, wide-eyed, and said, "Mr. Landon..."

Isabella froze and couldn't react to Sebastian's words for a while. The president's office had only one general manager assistant, Jack, but he had an independent office. How could she, a newcomer, share an office with Sebastian? 

"Mr. Landon..." Isabella spoke up.

Sebastian turned to look at her. Isabella's heart skipped a beat, but she said, "This isn't appropriate..."

"I am the boss, so I have the final say. You need to obey me, unless you're not part of the company," Sebastian said, then turned and walked into his office.

Jack immediately made a call to have the desks moved.

Laura was furious, her face contorted. She glared at Isabella and said, "You're really impressive, Isabella!"

After speaking, she turned and left. Right then, Jack called her back, "Wait a moment, Laura. A new candidate is coming for an interview this afternoon. You should receive them."

Laura took the documents and walked away, fuming in her high heels.

"Congratulations, Isabella," Jack congratulated her sincerely.

"I don't think this is right, Jack. Maybe you should talk to Mr. Landon. I'm afraid I've offended everyone."

Jack smiled and said, "I know Mr. Landon's temper. He's not afraid to offend people. You don't have to feel uneasy. I believe in Mr. Landon's judgment. You're definitely qualified for the job."

Moving a desk only took about half an hour. As Isabella entered the president's office, Laura's mouth twisted with anger. She picked up a cup of water and went into the pantry, quickly drinking two cups of water, but it couldn't extinguish the fire of anger in her heart. Just then, her phone rang. It was a call from Vanessa.

Laura answered without thinking. "Hello!"

"It's a beautiful morning. Who made you so angry, Laura? Why are you so irritable?"

"Who else could it be? It's that scheming witch Isabella, of course!" Laura recounted the whole story to Vanessa, not forgetting to vent her frustrations. "Do you think Mr. Landon's gone crazy? He said he saw qualities in Isabella? What qualities? Did he only see those qualities after she took off her clothes? I feel like there's definitely something going on between them. It's like ever since we came back from the camping trip, Mr. Landon's attitude toward Isabella changed a lot. You think... could it be that Isabella and Mr. Landon slept together that night?"

"Stop talking nonsense!" Vanessa immediately interrupted her fantasy. "I was going to tell you this later, Laura, but now that I see you've misunderstood Isabella and Mr. Landon, I have to tell you the truth."

"What is it?"

Vanessa paused and said, "Actually, I quit this job for Sebastian."

Laura's mind went blank for a moment. "For Mr. Landon? Why?"

"Because he's the man I told you about, my fiancÃ©."

Laura was shocked and dropped the cup in her hand. "You... what did you say? Mr. Landon is your fiancÃ©?!"

"I've only told you about it so far, so you can't tell anyone else," Vanessa cautioned.

Laura was excited. "Wait... you and Mr. Landon... when did this happen? Why didn't I know about this?"

"It's been a while," Vanessa vaguely replied. "It's been over half a year."

"It's been so long? You hid it well, Vanessa!" Laura was a little angry. "I told you all my secrets. I can't believe you kept this big secret from me."

"I didn't mean to hide it from you. The Landon Group prohibits office romances, you know. I didn't want to give up this job, but I really had no choice. I needed to think about marriage, so I had to resign. So please, stop talking about Isabella. There's really nothing between her and Sebastian."

Laura raised an eyebrow. "Fine, but I still don't like her! I won't let her off the hook! It doesn't matter even if she's transferred to the office. I better not catch her doing anything wrong, or I'll make sure she leaves."

"By the way, I called to ask you about something else."

"What is it?"

"Is someone coming for an interview this afternoon?"

"Yes, Jack assigned that to me."

"Can you do me a favor?"

"Sure, what is it?"

"If the woman coming for the interview is Kelsey Jose, please don't let her pass the interview."

Laura was puzzled. "Why? Is she your enemy?"

Vanessa didn't hide anything from Laura, "She's my love rival. She's from the Jose family, she's Zaire's sister. She's not really there for the interview. She's just there to see Sebastian."

"So that's how it is... Don't worry, I won't let her pass the interview so you can become Mr. Landon's wife."

"Thank you, Laura. If it weren't for you helping me at the company, I'd really be worried about someone challenging my position while I was gone," Vanessa said politely. "I'll treat you to a meal in a few days."

Laura liked that and quickly said, "When you get married to Mr. Landon, I want to be a bridesmaid."

"That's for sure."

A few minutes later, Laura came out of the pantry and happened to run into Jack.

"Jack," Laura greeted him with a smile, her steps becoming lighter.

Jack looked at her. "Are you okay?"

She had been so angry. How had her mood suddenly improved after spending a few minutes in the pantry?

Laura didn't answer him directly. "It's a secret!"

Jack didn't know what to say.

---

In Sebastian's office.

Isabella's desk was placed next to the French windows, very close to Sebastian's desk. She just had to turn her head to see Sebastian.

"Why did you do this, Mr. Landon?" Isabella couldn't help but ask.

Sebastian looked at her, "Didn't they say I favored you? I'll let everyone know about this then."

Isabella was somewhat shocked.

She knew Sebastian was never afraid of anyone else's opinions, but she hadn't expected him to be so independent.

Sebastian looked at her pink cheeks. "What's wrong? Are you afraid?"

Isabella shook her head, "I'm not afraid. I'll work hard and make sure I don't embarrass you."

Isabella stood straight, almost raising her hand to take an oath.

###chapter 35 One More Henchman
In the afternoon, in the interview office.

Laura pushed the door open and found two girls sitting inside. One of the girls stood up with a pleasing smile on her face when she saw Laura enter, while the other girl remained seated, raising an eyebrow to assess Laura with a proud look on her face.

"Are you both here for the interview?" Laura placed the documents down and sat opposite them.

The girl who was standing replied, "Yes."

The girl who was seated didn't speak, maintaining her arrogant demeanor, as if this was her company.

Laura felt unhappy but didn't show it. She said to the girl who was standing, "Bring me your resume."

The girl quickly handed over her resume with both hands, showing respect.

Laura glanced at the girl's name, "Are you Samantha Cook?"

"Yes," Samantha replied.

Laura glanced at her briefly then turned to the girl who was sitting down. "Where is your resume?"

"I don't have a resume. My name is Kelsey Jose. My brother is Zaire Jose. He made an arrangement with Mr. Landon. Mr. Landon told me to come here for an interview."

Laura raised an eyebrow. "I'm sorry, but I need to follow the company protocol. Without a resume, I can't conduct an interview with you."

With that, she organized her papers and said to Samantha, "Come with me."

Samantha hadn't expected it to go so well and was a bit surprised. She quickly followed along.

Kelsey felt frustrated. She hurriedly dialed Zaire's number. "I'm sorry, the number you have dialed unavailable..."

Laura pressed the elevator button. Samantha accompanied her on the ride.

On the way up, Laura asked, "Why are you applying for the position of the president's assistant?"

"Nothing special, I just feel that I'm capable of handling this job," Samantha answered.

Laura turned her head and scrutinized her. "Do you have a boyfriend?"

Samantha was taken aback. "Yes."

When Laura heard that answer, she let her guard down and didn't ask anything else.

Laura first took Samantha around to familiarize herself with the environment of the Landon Group, then had her complete the onboarding process at the human resources department, and finally led her to the president's office.

She introduced Samantha to everyone and brought her to a corner, saying, "This will be your workstation from now on."

"Okay, thank you, Laura," Samantha said, "Can I be your online friend, Laura? If there's anything you need me to do, just let me know. I promise I'll do it well."

"You're quite clever." Laura enjoyed being flattered, so she immediately agreed to Samantha's request.

Samantha looked around and asked in a low voice, "Laura, I have a friend who also works here, but I haven't seen her. Her name is Isabella Miller."

"Your friend works here too? What's her name?" 

"Isabella Miller," Samantha replied.

Laura frowned and her expression changed. "Isabella is your friend?"

Samantha could clearly sense Laura's contempt in her eyes, so she quickly explained, "We used to be quite close, but we had a falling out due to some issues. I saw her when I first came to the Landon Group. She told me she works in the president's office, so I thought she was telling the truth... but it seems like she was just bragging."

She thought, 'how could Isabella possibly work in the CEO's office at the Landon Group? '

Laura sneered, "She used to sit in your position, but not anymore..."

"Did she get fired?" Samantha pretended to be regretful and shocked, but she was secretly pleased. She had originally planned to take all of Isabella's belongings and push her out once she came in. But she hadn't expect Isabella to be dismissed before she had the chance to do anything. Unfortunately, she hadn't seen Isabella making a mistake and getting kicked out.

"She didn't get fired, she got promoted."

"What... what? She got promoted?" Samantha was stunned.

Laura raised her chin toward the CEO's office, "That happened yesterday. Mr. Landon picked her out personally. Her desk has been moved into his office. She's the only one in our office who has achieved that. Your friend is really impressive."

Samantha found it hard to believe. "Does Mr. Landon value her that much?"

Laura smirked, "Who knows? All I know is that she's now the apple of Mr. Landon's eye. Since you're her friend, maybe you'll benefit from it too."

"I don't want that." Samantha had a righteous expression on her face, but deep down, she was filled with jealousy. "Laura, Isabella and I have fallen out. We can't reconcile. I think I have a similar personality to you, so if you need me for anything, just let me know. I'll do my best."

Laura smiled. "Alright."

She was feeling frustrated, so of course she would welcome another henchman.

Samantha tidied up her workspace and intentionally placed her name card on the desk. She took a photo and updated her status to share it, "I've started working here. Everyone says it's difficult to get a job in the CEO's office at the Landon Group, but I felt like it was easy. ðŸ™ƒ"

Soon, there were several likes and comments below her post.

"Wow! Samantha, you're working in the CEO's office at the Landon Group?"

"You're really impressive."

"Oh my god, how did you manage to do that? Are they hiring? I want to work there too."

When she saw those comments, Samantha's vanity was greatly satisfied.

She sent the photo to Matthew.

Matthew immediately called her and began questioning her. "You're at the Landon Group?"

"Yes." Samantha played with her name card in her hand. "Aren't you happy for me, Matthew?"

Matthew didn't say anything else, just said, "As long as you're happy."

Samantha sensed that his tone was off and asked, "What's wrong? Aren't you happy that I joined the Landon Group?"

"I...I'm not..."

"Why do I feel like you're being bitter?"

Only then did Matthew say, "I didn't expect you to join the Landon Group, let alone the CEO's office."

"So, you didn't think I could do it. Oh, by the way, Isabella is in the same department as me," Samantha intentionally mentioned Isabella to see Matthew's reaction.

Matthew only replied lightly and didn't ask anything more.

Only then did Samantha relax. She hung up the phone and saw Isabella coming out of the room. However, Isabella didn't see her and headed toward the restroom.

Samantha looked around and saw that no one noticed her, so she got up and followed her.

When Isabella came out of the restroom, she saw Samantha washing her hands. She was taken aback, but she didn't want to greet her, so she ignored Samantha and prepared to leave.

"Bella," Samantha called her happily, "It's really you? What a coincidence."

Isabella glanced at her indifferently, "Really?"

Isabella wasn't surprised to see Samantha here.

Samantha never hid her ambition.

That day, when Isabella met Samantha downstairs, Isabella guessed that Samantha would try to find a way to get into the CEO's office, but she hadn't expected it to happen so soon...
###chapter 36 That's Unfortunate
Samantha raised her employee badge. "I just started working here. We're colleagues now."

Isabella looked at her seriously. "Looks like I'm unlucky."

Samantha didn't understand what Isabella meant.

As if afraid that she wouldn't understand, Isabella explained further. "What I mean is, I was already unlucky to be your friend and roommate before. I thought I would never see you again after graduating college, but now we're colleagues. Why do you always appear wherever I am?"

If Isabella hadn't said that so seriously, Samantha would have thought she was hallucinating.

Isabella, who never resisted when anyone picked on her, was speaking very sharply today.

Samantha didn't know what to say for a moment. Isabella's change shocked her.

When Isabella saw that Samantha wasn't saying anything, she opened the door and left.

Sebastian was in the middle of a video conference when Isabella returned to the office. When he saw her come back, he raised his hand slightly. 

Isabella walked over. "Mr. Landon."

"Could you make me a cup of coffee, please?"

"Of course." Isabella entered his private pantry, put the coffee beans in the coffee machine, set the program, and waited beside it.

She felt uneasy as she thought about her encounter with Samantha in the bathroom. She didn't like verbally attacking others because she and Nina had experienced persecution when they were young. She understood how it felt to be hurt by someone's words, but she hadn't been able to control herself earlier. Seeing Samantha here made her feel a little nauseous.

---

Sebastian finished the video conference. He leaned back in his chair, looking like he was taking a rest.

Although she had only moved here less than a day ago, Isabella had seen how busy Sebastian was.

He had to constantly deal with all kinds of business and attend many meetings.

Isabella had known that he was busy before, but now she truly understood how hard he worked.

Isabella picked up the freshly brewed coffee, put two sugar cubes on a saucer, and walked toward Sebastian.

"Here's your coffee, Mr. Landon..." Isabella placed the coffee on the table. At that moment, Sebastian turned his chair around. Isabella was taken aback when she caught a glimpse of the bracelet he was playing with.

It was the bracelet she had accidentally left with him during the camping trip.

Sebastian had even asked her if she knew whose bracelet it was.

She thought he would just casually throw it away in the trash, but he had kept it. Before Isabella came to the Landon Group, the bracelet had been broken once and she had taken it to be repaired.

Afterward, she was afraid of damaging it further, so she didn't dare wear it again. After joining the Landon Group, she kept it in her pocket. No one at the Landon Group knew she had that bracelet.

But now Samantha was here. If she happened to see it, Isabella's past would be exposed...

"Isabella?" Sebastian called her.

Isabella snapped out of her thoughts, meeting his deep gaze. "What are you thinking about?"

Isabella shook her head. "Nothing."

But deep down, she secretly thought that she needed to steal that bracelet back while Sebastian was absent.

As she was thinking that, Jack pushed the door open. "The meeting is about to start, Mr. Landon. Would you like to go now?"

Sebastian nodded, then took a few sips of coffee. He put the cup down and opened the second drawer, putting the bracelet inside.

Isabella thought to herself that when Sebastian left, she would take the bracelet, so no one would know... 

But as soon as this idea flashed through her mind, she heard Jack calling her. "Isabella, bring the recording equipment. We're going together."

Isabella hesitated for a moment, "Me?"

"Yes," Jack nodded. "You'll attend every meeting with Mr. Landon from now on."

Isabella glanced at Sebastian's office and said, "Do I have to go?"

"You don't have to go," Jack replied readily. "If you don't want to work anymore."

Isabella didn't know what to say.

Samantha watched Isabella and Jack leave together with Sebastian, feeling jealous. No wonder Isabella had become so sharp-tongued. She had found support at the Landon Group. Things were different when someone was helping her. Samantha felt that Isabella seemed more confident than before.

As Isabella followed behind Sebastian, she radiated confidence.

Laura happened to pass by her desk. Samantha called her. "Laura."

"What's up?" Laura turned around.

"This is my first day at work. How about I treat everyone to dinner tonight?" Samantha suggested.

"Sure."

"Shall I invite the other colleagues too?"

"Okay, I'll help you with that."

Samantha's eyes shifted. "What about Jack?"

"Jack's usually very busy and doesn't often join us for these small gatherings. You'd better not bother him."

"And Mr. Landon?" Samantha tested.

Laura chuckled as she looked at her, "You want to invite Mr. Landon to dinner? Do you know why I asked you if you had a boyfriend during the interview, Samantha?"

Samantha shook her head.

Laura said, "Since you have a boyfriend, you won't get any ideas about Mr. Landon."

"No, no, no. Laura, you've misunderstood me," Samantha quickly explained. "I don't have any ideas about Mr. Landon, I just want to treat everyone to a meal."

Laura's eyes carried a hint of scrutiny, "It's better that way. In other words, even if you did have any ideas, Mr. Landon wouldn't be interested in you because... he has a fiancÃ©e."

"Really?" Samantha was shocked again. "I wonder who could be so lucky to have such an outstanding and handsome fiancÃ© like Mr. Landon. That woman must be very beautiful, right?"

"She used to work in the assistant department as well. I guess she resigned recently to prepare for the wedding with Mr. Landon, so that's why there was this vacancy," Laura said, feeling a bit jealous. "Vanessa is actually quite average-looking, she's not as good-looking as me. I don't know what she did to become Mr. Landon's fiancÃ©e. Once she marries Mr. Landon, she'll be the boss lady. That'll be really prestigious! But we still have to continue working at the company."

Samantha comforted her with a smile, "Everyone has different tastes. I think you're very good-looking Laura. You have a great figure and sense of style. You look like a big star."

Laura felt a little better when she heard that. "But luckily, I have a good relationship with her. If she really does marry Mr. Landon, it will benefit me too."

---

It was Isabella's first time entering the executive conference room. She was amazed by the spacious and bright room.

Sebastian took his seat at the head. That dominating presence appeared instantly.

Jack pulled out a chair for Isabella and said, "You can sit here."

"Thank you." After sitting down, Isabella opened her notebook and took out a pen, ready to take meeting minutes.

Jack turned to her and exclaimed, "Didn't you bring your laptop?"
###chapter 37 A Taste of the Past
Isabella was also stunned and asked him in a low voice, "Didn't you say I should bring a notebook to take notes?"

She raised the black notebook in her hand, looking innocent.

Jack laughed at her. "I said bring a laptop. Why did you come with that? There'll be a lot to record later, won't you be exhausted?"

It was the first time Isabella had attended this kind of meeting and she had no experience, so she hadn't thought about that. Besides, she only had one laptop, which Charlie had given her when he didn't need it after graduating from college. Isabella had left it in her dormitory. Even if she had brought it, it would probably crash halfway through the meeting. That would be even worse. Isabella thought for a moment and said, "It's okay, I write fast."

Sebastian, who was sitting in front, said to Jack, "Give her my laptop."

"Sure, Mr. Landon." Jack didn't hesitate and got up to hand Sebastian's laptop to Isabella.

The conference room was quiet, with dozens of pairs of eyes staring at Sebastian.

Occasionally, a few curious glances would sweep towards Isabella. Even though the Landon Group had been established for so long, they had never seen Mr. Landon with a female assistant before.

This was unusual and absurd.

Isabella had never experienced such a grand scene before, and she suddenly felt a bit flustered. "No... it's not necessary..."

Jack simply handed her the laptop and reassured her, "Mr. Landon wants you to use it, so go ahead. You don't have to be shy."

Isabella felt somewhat helpless.

Was she being shy? No, she was actually feeling embarrassed.

The silver-gray laptop was thin and lightweight, barely adding any weight to Isabella's legs. The screen resolution was very high. It was several times smoother than the one Isabella had used before. Isabella quickly learned how to use it. Her fair fingers typed swiftly on the keyboard. Sebastian occasionally turned his head to catch a glimpse of Isabella's hands. It was the first time he realized that Isabella had attractive hands.

Suddenly spotting an error she had recorded, Sebastian leaned closer to her and pointed it out.

Isabella immediately understood and quickly corrected it, whispering, "Thank you, Mr. Landon."

Sebastian caught a whiff of her fragrance and suddenly asked, "Did you change your perfume?"

Isabella was taken aback. Thankfully, his voice was low, and someone happened to be speaking at that moment, which drowned out his words. But his question still startled Isabella. "No..."

"I seem to remember that you've never used this scent before."

Isabella wondered, what scent had she used before? How did he know?

Isabella's brain nearly crashed. "I don't wear perfume, Mr. Landon."

Sebastian seemed somewhat fixated on that question and pressed on. "Where does the fragrance on you come from, then?"

"It's..." Isabella felt embarrassed. After all, how could someone discuss scent with their assistant during a meeting?

But Sebastian continued to stare at her with his intense gaze, waiting for her answer.

After hesitating for a while, Isabella's face turned red. "It's... body wash."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow ever so slightly. He pretended to casually adjust his cuff, shifting his gaze away. But he could still sense that faint fragrance emanating from her. He felt that scent interfering with his thoughts, causing him to be somewhat distracted during the meeting.

---

After the meeting, Isabella went to the restroom.

Sebastian stared at her figure, lost in thought.

"Mr. Landon?" Jack interrupted his thoughts, noticing that something was off with him. "What's the matter?"

"Have you noticed..." Sebastian spoke slowly, "Isabella acting strange?"

"Huh?" Jack was confused. "What do you mean, Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian was about to speak when someone suddenly rushed over and collided with him. Papers scattered all over the floor, and the girl looked panicked as she apologized. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Did I bump into you?"

The girl in front of him was young and beautiful, with a delicate appearance. But Sebastian felt nothing for her. He raised his hand and patted the spot where the girl had touched him, looking slightly displeased.

Jack spoke with a hint of rebuke, "Which department are you from?"

"I'm from the Assistant to the President's department."

Jack understood. "You're the new intern, right?"

"Yes." The girl raised her own work ID and looked steadily at Sebastian. "My name is Samantha. Are you... Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian glanced at her and said in a flat voice, "When did the requirements for the assistant department become so poor, Jack?"

He meant that Samantha was not suitable for the assistant department.

Jack nodded. "I'll handle it right away."

Just then, Isabella came out of the restroom.

"Bella." Samantha greeted her warmly as soon as she saw her.

Isabella frowned, thinking, the more she didn't want to see someone, the more they appeared in front of her.

Sebastian looked at Isabella and asked, "Do you know her?"

Isabella was about to explain when Samantha took the initiative to hold her hand. "Isabella and I were college classmates, roommates, and good friends. Isn't that right, Isabella?"

Isabella felt flustered. She quickly pulled away from Samantha and stood aside, keeping her distance. "We used to have a good relationship, but not anymore."

"Bella..." Samantha looked disappointed.

Jack said, "Come with me."

Samantha stared. "Help me plead with Mr. Landon, Bella. I just started this job. I don't want to lose it like this."

Isabella looked at Sebastian, surprised. "Are you firing her?"

Sebastian nodded. He looked at her with gentle eyes. "If you help her plead, I can reconsider."

Isabella quickly shook her head.

She didn't want to help Samantha at all. She would rather Samantha leave as soon as possible.

"Looks like you really dislike her?" Sebastian pressed the elevator button and casually asked, "Why?"

Isabella bit her lip and said, "She stole something from me."
###chapter 38 Mr. Landon's Nosebleed
Sebastian couldn't understand why he was so curious about this. He couldn't control his curiosity about Isabella. He wanted to get closer to her, and he couldn't help but want to know more about her.

After a moment of silence, Isabella finally said, "She stole my boyfriend."

As the elevator arrived, Sebastian hesitated when he heard her words and turned to look at her. Isabella's head was down and she seemed a bit upset.

Sebastian felt unexpectedly nervous. He couldn't help but reach out his hand to Isabella. He placed his palm lightly on top of her head and gave it a gentle pat. Isabella looked up in surprise.

Her clear eyes locked onto Sebastian's, causing a sudden flutter in his heart. She was like an injured little cat, and he wanted to hold her in his arms and comfort her.

That thought quickly took root in his mind. Sebastian didn't think much about it and reached out, grabbing Isabella's arm and pulling her toward him.

Isabella stumbled into a warm and sturdy embrace. After the elevator doors closed, she saw her own shocked face in the mirror on the wall, as well as Sebastian slightly lowering his head and gently embracing her. This position seemed very intimate. Sebastian's ear was pressed against hers, and Isabella could hear his slightly heavy yet suppressed breath.

Isabella felt perplexed.

Wait, what just happened?

Why had Mr. Landon embraced her?

"...Mr. Landon..." Isabella clenched her fist and lightly pushed at him uneasily.

She only pushed him lightly, but he staggered back a couple of steps. Worried, Isabella quickly reached out to support him. "Mr. Landon?"

Isabella felt anxious, thinking, could he be trying to fake an accident? But she hadn't pushed him hard at all, and he looked quite strong. Why couldn't he withstand just a push?

Suddenly, warm liquid dripped onto Isabella's face. She looked up and was astonished.

"Mr. Landon, you... you're bleeding!"

Mr. Landon had a nosebleed.

Isabella's face turned pale with shock.

After returning to the office, Jack immediately called Sebastian's personal doctor, Marvin Finn.

Isabella and Jack waited outside while Marvin examined Sebastian,. Jack glanced at the lounge and asked in a low voice, "What happened? Why did he suddenly get a nosebleed?"

Isabella was perplexed and shook her head. "I don't know... it just happened so suddenly."

"Did something happen? Did Mr. Landon bump his nose? Or did you say something to upset him?" 

Isabella felt a bit embarrassed.

"Why are you blushing? Speak up!" Jack was genuinely concerned. After all, he had been with Sebastian for many years, and Sebastian was healthy. He never got sick, let alone had a nosebleed.

Isabella's face turned redder and redder, but she still couldn't say a word.

What could she say? Mr. Landon had hugged her? Even if she said it, she didn't think Jack would believe it. She could barely believe it herself. Actually, thinking about it now, Sebastian hadn't seemed to hug her intentionally. It was possible that he had been feeling unwell, couldn't stand, and grabbed her for support.

Isabella felt a bit relieved. She believed that Mr. Landon was a gentle and honest person who wouldn't hug her intentionally.

After a while, the door to the lounge opened and Marvin came out with the medicine box.

Jack hurriedly approached, "How is Mr. Landon, Dr. Finn?"

"No major issues. He just had a nosebleed," Dr. Finn replied.

Jack was puzzled. "Why did he suddenly get a nosebleed? Does he have any dietary issues?"

Dr. Finn shook his head, "Mr. Landon has always had a healthy diet, there's no issues there."

"Could it be because of work stress?"

Dr. Finn shook his head again. "I asked, but he said it's not related."

Jack was confused. "Then why did it happen? We need to find the cause, right? Mr. Landon was bleeding!"

Dr. Finn glanced at Isabella and coughed lightly, "I'll prescribe some medication for him. I have already discussed the specific cause with him, and he'll take care of it himself."

"Okay, Dr. Finn. Thank you." Jack was still curious and took out his phone to search for what would cause nosebleeds.

Isabella watched him and felt touched. She thought to herself, 'Jack really cares about Sebastian. '

After Dr. Finn finished organizing his things, he turned to see Jack on his phone and coughed again, saying, "You don't have to search anymore. Hurry up and come with me to get the medicine."

"Okay." Jack put down his phone and turned to Isabella. "I'll go get the medicine, Isabella. You stay here and take care of Mr. Landon."

Before Isabella could say anything, Jack left with Marvin.

As soon as the office door closed, Isabella heard the sound of a glass breaking from the lounge. She was startled and quickly pushed open the door. "Mr. Landon..."

The sheer curtains had been drawn in the lounge, and only a faint light filtered in through them. Sebastian lay on the bed, but one hand was dangling in mid-air, feeling for something. A broken glass lay on the floor. As Sebastian's fingers were about to touch the shards of glass, Isabella rushed over and grabbed his hand. "The floor is covered in glass fragments, Mr. Landon. What are you searching for? Let me help you."

"My phone."

"Alright." Isabella placed his hand by the side of the bed and crouched down to search on the floor. Soon, she spotted the black phone wedged between the bed and the bedside table.

"I found it." Isabella reached out to grab it, but she couldn't reach it. She extended her entire arm, but couldn't get a hold of it. Since the bed and bedside table were fixed, Isabella had to use her slender frame to try and get it. She leaned her head to the side and desperately stretched her arm further inside.

Suddenly, her fingertips touched something icy cold, and Isabella rejoiced. "I can reach it."

As she was about to retrieve the phone, Sebastian suddenly turned his head to look at her. They were already very close, but they became even closer at Sebastian's movement. They seemed to be lying next to each other.

Isabella felt a bit flustered.

Sebastian gazed at her face inches away, feeling a heat in his nostrils. The blood that had just stopped flowing began to trickle again.

"Mr. Landon!" Isabella exclaimed in shock. She forgot that her arm was still stuck in the gap. As a result, she felt a piercing pain in her shoulder blade.

"What's wrong?" Sebastian immediately sat up from the bed when he heard her low cry. However, his nosebleed grew worse. Nevertheless, he paid no attention to himself and grabbed a nearby towel to cover his mouth and nose. He crouched down next to Isabella. "Are you stuck?"

Isabella tried to move, but her shoulder had become numb from the pain.

"Don't move, you'll make the injury worse," Sebastian said. "Let me see."

He tossed aside the towel and extended his hand, placing one on each side of Isabella's shoulders and gently pulling outward. "Take it slowly. No rush. Be gentle."

The pain almost made Isabella faint. She clenched her teeth and worked with him, closing her eyes. The only thing she could hear was the man's deep voice. "Take it slowly. Don't rush. I'm here."

Although it was painful, she didn't feel afraid at all. She felt strangely reassured.

"All right." As Sebastian exclaimed joyfully, Isabella slumped into his arms.

She fainted from the pain.

Thus, Marvin, who had just walked out of the Landon Group's gate, had to hurriedly get a first aid kit and return with Jack. 

Jack pushed open the door and rushed in, shouting, "Mr. Landon!" 

But when he saw the situation in the room, his voice abruptly trailed off.
###chapter 39 A Bit Intrigued
The room was quiet as Isabella lay unconscious in bed. Sebastian sat by her side. His nosebleed had stopped, but his face and body were covered in blood, which looked quite frightening. However, his focus was entirely on Isabella. Jack had never seen Sebastian look at someone with an expression like that.

When they arrived, Sebastian stood up and grabbed Marvin, saying, "Check the injury on her shoulder."

Dr. Finn rubbed his nose and said, "Well... she's a girl. Should we wait for her to wake up and ask for her opinion?"

Sebastian frowned. "Just do as I say. Stop that useless talk."

Marvin stepped forward reluctantly.

However, Isabella was wearing a long-sleeved shirt, so they had to remove one sleeve to see the injury. Although gender didn't matter to the doctor, since Isabella was a girl, Marvin had many concerns about doing so without her or her family's permission.

"What are you doing? Just do it," Sebastian, who usually had a steady temper, was rarely this impatient. Marvin was startled by his sudden outburst.

Trembling, Marvin reached out his hand and had just touched the collar of Isabella's shirt when he felt it tighten. Sebastian was pulling at his collar from behind, preparing to pull him away. "I'll do it!"

Marvin was surprised.

Sebastian reached out to unbutton Isabella's shirt, paused as if he remembered something, and turned his head. He saw Jack and Marvin standing behind him, both looking at him and Isabella with inexplicable expressions.

"Turn around," Sebastian said sternly.

Jack and Marvin glanced at each other silently, then turned around in perfect unison.

Only then did Sebastian feel relieved. He unbuttoned Isabella's shirt, but when he was halfway through, he suddenly remembered that he was a man too. Wasn't it inappropriate for him to do this? But when he saw Isabella's face that was pale from the pain, he didn't care about that anymore. He unbuttoned her shirt determinedly. He supported the back of her head with one hand and carefully removed the left sleeve.

Isabella's figure was much lighter and thinner than he had imagined. After removing her clothes, he could clearly see the large swollen injury on her shoulder.

No wonder she had fainted from the pain. Sebastian looked at Isabella, blaming himself for what happened. If he had known he would hurt her, he wouldn't have let her pick up his phone for him... Losing the phone wouldn't have mattered, but seeing Isabella injured nearly broke his heart.

Sebastian covered the rest of Isabella's body with a blanket, leaving only her left arm and shoulder exposed, before calling Marvin over.

Marvin had just picked up Isabella's hand and was about to move it when Sebastian sternly said, "Be gentle."

Marvin hesitated for a moment, then nodded. Under Sebastian's gaze, he slowly turned Isabella's arm.

After a thorough examination, Marvin breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Luckily, none of her bones are broken."

Sebastian covered Isabella's injured hand with the blanket and asked, "Is it just a superficial injury?"

"Jack and I were about to go get some medicine. I'll prescribe two ointments for her. If she follows the instructions, she'll be fine in two weeks."

"Alright, hurry up."

Marvin and Jack exchanged a glance and quietly left the rest area.

They walked out of the office in silence and ran into Laura.

"What's wrong with Mr. Landon, Jack? Marvin has come up twice already," Laura asked.

Jack glanced at her and said, "Nothing's wrong."

Then he walked away with Marvin.

Laura watched their departing figures and dialed Vanessa's number on her phone...

When Isabella opened her eyes, she saw a man covered in blood sitting by her bed and sat up in fright. That movement caused pain in her arm, making her break out in a cold sweat.

"Don't move." His hands gently supported her back. "Jack went to get some medicine. Just lie down for now."

Isabella lifted her head and realized that the man covered in blood was her boss, Sebastian.

She remembered what had happened before she lost consciousness and felt both surprised and amused. "Mr. Landon, what happened to you..."

"I'm fine," Sebastian said nonchalantly. He used both hands to support her, being very careful with his movements. "How do you feel now? Does it hurt?"

Isabella was actually in quite a bit of pain, but lied and said, "It doesn't hurt that much."

Sebastian knew she was pretending and softened a bit. "Just lie down for a while."

"No..." Isabella wanted to get out of bed.

This was his rest area, and it was his bed. She was just an ordinary employee. How could she sully her boss's bed?

One wanted to lie down, the other wanted to get up. The two of them clashed. Sebastian's fingers on her shoulder applied a little too much force. Isabella cried out in pain and lost her balance, falling back onto the bed. Sebastian instinctively reached out to pull her back. Halfway through, he remembered her shoulder injury and changed to using his palm to support the back of her head, not daring to exert too much force. They both fell onto the soft bed together.

Isabella lifted her head and met Sebastian's eyes.

In that moment, Isabella felt as if she could hear her own heart racing.

Sebastian had one hand pressed against his head, while the other hand supported him on the bed. He scanned Isabella's face several times.

"Isabella..." Sebastian's voice was slightly hoarse. His gaze slowly settled on her lips.

It felt as if the temperature in the room was rapidly rising...

"I've brought the medicine, Mr. Landon!" Jack hurriedly pushed open the door, his face filled with joy that quickly turned into shock.

Isabella silently turned her head away, feeling a profound sense of shame.

Sebastian removed his hand from under her head and reached out to take the ointment, a look of impatience on his face. "Did Dr. Finn explain how to use it?"

Jack avoided making eye contact. "Dr. Finn said to warm it up in the palm of your hand and rub it onto the wound with some pressure. It's best to do this three times a day, for three to five minutes each time."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. Why did that seem so suggestive?

He squeezed some ointment into his palm and told Jack, "You can leave now."

"Alright." Jack turned and walked away.

As he reached the door, he turned back as if he had remembered something. "Oh, by the way... Vanessa is here."

Sebastian didn't even lift his head. "I don't have time to see her."

Jack nodded. "Alright."

Then he left the resting room.

When Sebastian heard the office door closing, he turned around and found that Isabella had sat up from the bed. Her face was as rosy as a ripe apple, and her watery eyes would soften the hearts of anyone who looked into them.

Sebastian felt a little moved.
###chapter 40 Mrs. Landon
"Jack."

As Jack walked out of the office, he heard someone call his name. He turned around and saw Vanessa.

Vanessa was wearing a Chanel-style coat and carrying a black leather bag. Her hair was immaculately styled, and she was even wearing designer jewelry. This was a stark contrast to her previously low-key appearance.

"Where is Mr. Landon?"

Remembering Sebastian's instructions, Jack raised his hand to stop her. "Mr. Landon is very busy right now and can't see anyone."

Vanessa paused for a moment, then held up the thermos in her right hand. "I made oatmeal porridge for him."

"Give it to me." Jack reached out to take it.

But Vanessa avoided his hand and her smile stiffened. "I heard Isabella got a promotion. She shares an office with Mr. Landon now. Doesn't that mean she has a higher position than you?"

Although she was smiling, Jack could clearly sense her displeasure.

"That's Mr. Landon's decision. As a subordinate, my job is to follow the boss's arrangements."

Vanessa smiled and said, "Of course. I was just curious. Just asking."

Jack nodded. "If there's nothing else, I'll go and get busy."

"Okay." Vanessa's smile gradually disappeared as she watched Jack leave.

At that moment, Laura walked over and asked, "What did Jack say?"

"Nothing," Vanessa replied, turning around. Her smile returned.

Laura noticed Vanessa's Chanel suit and exclaimed, "Is that the latest collection from Chanel? I saw the pictures in a magazine last month, but the actual pieces look even better."

Before she could finish her sentence, Laura spotted Vanessa's bag. "Oh my, is that the new Louis Vuitton? The color is so luxurious."

Laura's gaze dropped to Vanessa's shoes. "Even your shoes are designer! Your outfit must be worth at least several hundred thousand dollars, Vanessa."

Laura enviously said, "Mr. Landon treats you so well! You're so lucky, Vanessa."

This was the first time Vanessa had felt someone's envy. Laura had a proud personality and attracted many suitors with her beauty. People often envied her. But now, Laura was envious of Vanessa because her suitors rarely possessed both good looks and wealth. If someone like Sebastian pursued Laura, she would feel incredibly happy.

"You're really lucky, Vanessa!" Laura said, grabbing Vanessa's hand, her tone filled with jealousy.

Blushing, Vanessa smiled and said, "It was fate."

Even though she said that, her sense of vanity and the satisfaction of being envied grew within her.

Just then, Samantha approached them, grabbing Laura's hand. "Please help me, Laura."

Samantha's face was full of tears, and she looked sorry for herself.

Sighing, Laura said, "If Mr. Landon wants to fire you, what can I do? I just asked you to deliver some documents, but you went to the wrong place and accidentally bumped into Mr. Landon. I can't make him take back his decision."

Samantha was on the verge of tears. She wanted to create an accidental encounter to leave a deeper impression on Sebastian, but she had ended up getting fired. She had only started working for half a day, and she hadn't familiarized herself with the workflow yet. She had even boasted about herself to her friends. If she got fired, she would become a laughingstock.

Laura couldn't stand Samantha's pestering and turned to see Vanessa suddenly coming up with a plan.

She pulled Vanessa aside and said to Samantha, "I have an idea. This is Mr. Landon's wife. Maybe she can help you."

Samantha looked at Vanessa in surprise. She had noticed Laura talking to her from afar.

She could tell that Vanessa was dressed in designer clothes and looked extravagant, but she didn't have much charm, even with her luxurious attire.

If Laura hadn't mentioned it, she would never have known that Vanessa was Sebastian's wife.

Vanessa sensed Samantha's skepticism and smiled, asking, "Is this the new intern in the department?"

She spoke to Samantha as Sebastian's wife would.

Samantha quickly reached out her hand and bowed, saying, "Hello, Mrs. Landon, I'm Samantha, the new intern assistant who just joined today. I heard Laura talk about your achievements before, but I never expected to have the honor of meeting you today. You look very elegant."

Vanessa knew Samantha was trying to flatter her, and her praise wasn't genuine, but she still felt satisfied.

"I don't work at the company any longer and can't get involved, so I can't help you," Vanessa said.

Vanessa did want to help Samantha, but she knew Sebastian wouldn't listen to her.

But Vanessa had to pretend to be selfless and not let anyone catch on.

"You won't help me plead my case?" Samantha looked disappointed. She really might lose this job. How would she explain it to her friends and Matthew?

Seeing this, Laura pulled Vanessa to the side and whispered, "You better help her out, Vanessa. Do you know who she is?"

"Who is she?" Vanessa asked.

"She's Isabella's college roommate and former close friend."

Vanessa exclaimed, "She's Isabella's friend?"

In that case, Vanessa couldn't leave her at the company.

Laura said, "They used to be friends, but not anymore. I heard Samantha saying that Isabella tried to seduce her boyfriend, but Samantha caught them, so their friendship fell apart."

Vanessa felt even more surprised and excited. "Isabella seduced Samantha's boyfriend? Really? How could she ruin someone else's relationship?"

Laura sneered. "I told you, Isabella's innocence is just an act. I really want to expose her. I don't understand why Mr. Landon always protects her. If Samantha stays, she'll definitely expose Isabella's ugly past, and everyone will see her for who she really is."

Vanessa thought for a moment, turned to Samantha and said, "Don't worry, I'll talk to Mr. Landon for you."
"Really? Thank you so much, Mrs. Landon."
###chapter 41 Oatmeal
In the lounge, Isabella saw Sebastian opening a tube of ointment and couldn't help but be shocked. "Mr. Landon!"

Sebastian stopped and looked at her, and Isabella stood up. "Give me the ointment, I'll apply it myself."

Sebastian glanced at her uncertainly and asked again, "Are you sure you can do it yourself?"

"I'm fine, it'll be no problem," Isabella nodded firmly.

Sebastian didn't insist anymore and twisted the cap off ointment and handed it to her. "Remember to apply the ointment, otherwise it will leave bruises."

As he spoke, he couldn't help but glance at her shoulder, remembering her curvaceous figure. He couldn't help but be slightly intrigued.

"Okay," Isabella nodded and said, "I'll leave then."

Before she finished speaking, Sebastian's phone suddenly rang.

Sebastian picked up the phone and glanced at it before answering. "Hello?"

Vanessa's voice came from the receiver. "Are you busy, Mr. Landon?"

"Yes, do you need something?" As Sebastian answered the call, he unconsciously glanced at Isabella. She stood quietly by while he was busy, appearing exceptionally attentive.

"I'm outside your office. Zoe made oatmeal and asked me to bring it to you, but Jack said you were busy."

Sebastian lowered his head and replied, "Wait a moment."

He hung up the phone and left the lounge with Isabella.

Isabella sat down at the desk and felt a sharp pain in her shoulder, but she had to endure it.

Two minutes later, Vanessa pushed the door open and walked in.

She entered the room and immediately looked over at Isabella, her eyes filled with surprise. "Isabella?" 

Isabella stood up and greeted her, "Hello, Ms. Field."

Vanessa looked Isabella up and down, smiling as she said, "I heard you got promoted, congratulations."

Isabella noticed Vanessa's unusual mood, but Vanessa continued to smile and didn't seem angry. Isabella pursed her lips, unsure of what to say.

"I had her move in. She's a bit shy, so don't give her a hard time," Sebastian's voice came in, clearly defending Isabella.

Vanessa laughed. "You've misunderstood, I genuinely wish Isabella well. Why would I make things difficult for her?"

She walked over to Sebastian's desk and placed a thermos down, saying, "I've been at the company for over a year, so I know the personnel situation. I'm genuinely happy for Isabella."

Sebastian glanced at her, feeling that she looked much better. "Just put the oatmeal over here. Thank you."

"Zoe told me to make sure you finish it and asked me to bring the thermos back clean," Vanessa implied that she wouldn't be leaving for the time being. Sebastian didn't mind her, but he did care about Zoe's feelings. Sebastian was a filial grandson, and he allowed Vanessa to come in at the mention of Zoe's name.

If Vanessa mentioned Zoe again, Sebastian wouldn't chase her away.

"Open it and have a taste," Sebastian said.

"Okay." Vanessa went to the water cooler and found a delicate bowl, scooped out a some porridge with a spoon, and brought it to Sebastian.

"Did you put tomatoes in this porridge?" Sebastian took a quick glance and furrowed his brow slightly.

"Yes," Vanessa noticed his expression and asked, "What's wrong?"

"Didn't Zoe tell you I don't like tomatoes?"

Vanessa suddenly became extra nervous, her expression stiffening. "She didn't."

She had made the oatmeal by herself and brought it over. It had nothing to do with Zoe, so there was no way she would know what Sebastian liked.

Sebastian had clearly exposed her lie, and Vanessa forced a smile, saying, "I guess Zoe made a mistake since she's getting older. If you don't like it, I'll just pour it out."

"It would be a waste to pour out the oatmeal," Sebastian said. He turned to Isabella and asked, "Isabella, do you like oatmeal?"

Isabella felt speechless at the sudden mention of her name.

Vanessa suppressed her anger and maintained a smile. "Isabella, if you like it, go ahead. It would be a pity to waste it after all, considering how long I cooked it."

Isabella could clearly sense Vanessa's displeasure and waved her hands repeatedly. "I don't really like it either. Thank you, though."

"Really?" Vanessa seemed somewhat disappointed. "That's a shame."

Sebastian didn't say anything more and simply said, "Just leave it for now. I'll give it to Jack later. He loves oatmeal."

Vanessa smiled and said, "Alright."

Vanessa poured the porridge back into the thermos. When she came out, Sebastian and Isabella were both busy with their own tasks. The seemingly harmonious and quiet scene was particularly grating to Vanessa.

She walked over and said, "Mr. Landon, while I was chatting with Laura, a girl named Samantha came crying to us and said she had been fired. I asked about the situation and thought her mistake was forgivable. She begged me for a long time, so I was wondering if you could..."

"No!" Sebastian flatly refused. "The company doesn't need careless employees like that."

Vanessa awkwardly chuckled and continued, "But I already promised her I'd help her, and I Laura say that if she was fired, Ms. Jose would replace her position."

Sebastian felt helpless at the mention of Kelsey. After all, she was Zaire's sister, and he and Zaire were both long-time collaborators and friends. It would be trouble if Kelsey joined the company.

When Vanessa saw him hesitate, she continued, "I heard that girl and Isabella were college classmates and good friends. Isn't that right, Isabella?"

Isabella answered, "Not anymore."

"It's normal for friends to have conflicts. Samantha looks very sorry for herself. Would you like to help plead for her?" Vanessa asked as she looked at her.

Isabella paused and said, "I'm sorry, but I'm just an ordinary employee. It's not my place to judge this."

Vanessa smiled slightly and continued, "I heard that your friendship fell apart because of a man."

Isabella stiffened.

"Even the closest friendships can experience fractures when it comes to matters of the heart. I understand that. But Isabella, since the situation has already passed and she didn't hold you responsible, you don't need to continue dwelling on it."

"I'm dwelling on it?" Isabella asked, puzzled. "What did Samantha tell you?"

Vanessa smiled discreetly and said, "It's nothing. She said you had an unpleasant argument over a man. But Isabella, I want to remind you not to always covet what belongs to others. It's no use trying to fight for something that isn't yours. I want to speak up for you, but you did do something wrong, and it would damage your reputation if it gets out."

Isabella became more confused as she listened. Sebastian then asked, "What exactly happened?"

Seeing the opportunity, Vanessa said, "Samantha said Isabella interfered with her relationship."

Isabella felt shocked.

How had she interfered with Samantha's relationship?

Isabella suspected that Samantha would lie, but she never imagined that Samantha would accuse her of doing what she had done in order to clear her own name.
###chapter 42 Keeping Distance
Isabella was getting so angry that her face turned red. But to Vanessa, she seemed embarrassed and guilty. Vanessa calmly said, "You're still young, Isabella, so you can change."

"I didn't," Isabella wanted to defend herself, but she suddenly saw Sebastian's gaze. His gaze was gentle, without any doubt, and so calm that it calmed her emotions.

Sebastian looked at her reddened eyes and said, "Go call Jack for me, Isabella."

Isabella hesitated for a moment. If he wanted to call Jack, he could easily do so with an internal phone call, he didn't need her to go to him. Sebastian was deliberately sending her away so he could have a conversation with Vanessa.

"Okay," Isabella got up and left the office.

Once the door was closed, Vanessa asked, "How are we handling Samantha's situation, Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian remained silent for a few seconds and said, "Since you pleaded for her, I'll give her another chance."

Vanessa was delighted. "Thank you, Mr. Landon."

She bent down and hugged Sebastian.

When Sebastian smelled the perfume on Vanessa, he could tell it was expensive, but he frowned uncomfortably. Instead, he thought the scent of body wash on Isabella more pleasant.

Isabella went to call Jack and saw Samantha, Laura, and Vanessa standing together.

When Samantha saw her, she quickly ran over and said, "Isabella, I know you don't like me, but I won't leave. Now that Mrs. Landon here, no one can kick me out."

Isabella bit her lip and questioned her, "Why did you tell Ms. Field I intruded on your relationship? It was clearly you..."

"I didn't say anything wrong. If it weren't for you, Matthew and I would've been together a long time ago. In the beginning, Matthew liked me, but you two met each other first. Even though he dated you, he loved me. He doesn't care about you at all. Did you and Matthew ever kiss while you were together?" Samantha lowered her voice so only Isabella could hear her.

After hearing her argument, Isabella's face turned red again, feeling ashamed for Samantha. But Vanessa and Laura believed that Samantha hit the nail on the head.

"Isabella is blushing. It looks like Samantha is telling the truth. Isabella is shameless," Vanessa laughed lightly. "If you're shameless, you might be able to benefit from that. With Samantha around, maybe she'll behave."

Samantha was a threat to Isabella. If she didn't comply with Vanessa, Vanessa would get Samantha to expose Isabella's ugly past and make it impossible for her to continue working at the company.

Jack walked to the office door and turned around to see Samantha and Isabella talking. He was displeased with Samantha's arrogant demeanor, frowning and calling out, "Isabella."

Isabella turned her head.

Jack said, "It's time to go in."

Isabella bit her lip and silently followed him into the office.

Laura and Vanessa saw what happened.

Laura frowned and said, "Isabella is cunning. Jack treats her differently now."

After hearing Laura's words, Vanessa's smile faded a bit.

Samantha walked over, looking particularly proud. "I invited everyone to have dinner at a French restaurant tonight, Mrs. Landon. Would you like to join us?"

"I won't join you. I hope you all have a fun time."

"Did you need something from me, Mr. Landon?" Jack asked as he stood in front of the desk.

"Yes." Sebastian casually handed him a document. "Take a look at this."

Jack opened it and looked through the two pages. "This is what I just organized for you. Do you have any questions?"

Sebastian pointed to the nearby sofa and said, "Go sit over there and review it carefully."

Although Jack didn't understand, he followed Sebastian's words and walked over to sit on the sofa, carefully flipping through the document.

As the end of the workday approached, Jack had gone through the file many times but still couldn't find any issues. He read through it again word by word and then approached Sebastian. "Please tell me where the problem is, Mr. Landon."

Sebastian shifted his gaze away from the computer screen. "Have you finished reading it?"

"Yes."

"Fine." Sebastian glanced at his watch again and said, "Once you're done, you can go home."

Jack anxiously said, "But you haven't told me where the problem is in this file."

"Oh." Sebastian took the file and said, "There's no problem. I just wanted you to read it a few more times. In case there was an issue."

Jack stood there in disbelief.

Sebastian ignored him and called out to Isabella, who was packing up to leave. "Wait a moment."

Isabella paused. "I've completed my work, Mr. Landon. You're not asking me to work overtime, are you?"

She could accept working overtime, but Nina was still in the hospital, and she needed to go there to be with her.

"No," Sebastian said, shutting down his computer. When he saw that Jack was still standing there, he said, "Aren't you leaving?"

"I'm leaving. Goodbye, Mr. Landon, Isabella."

"Goodbye, Jack."

After Jack left, only Isabella and Sebastian remained in the office.

Sebastian went to the water cooler and gave Isabella the thermos Vanessa had sent. "Here, it's for you."

Isabella shook her head and refused, "I don't like oatmeal porridge, Mr. Landon."

"It's not for you."

"What?" Isabella was a bit stunned.

"Help me pour the porridge out and clean the container, then bring it to me tomorrow morning." Sebastian said seriously, as if he was really assigning a task to Isabella.

Isabella said, "I'll go clean it at the sink for you."

"No, I hate the smell of tomatoes. The entire company needs to be free of tomatoes."

Isabella felt shocked.

Did Sebastian really hate tomatoes so much?

She had no choice but to reach out and take the thermos. "Alright."

As she took the thermos, Sebastian asked, "Are you going back to school? I happen to be heading there, I can give you a ride."

Isabella shook her head. "I'm going to the hospital."

"The hospital?" Sebastian pretended to be surprised.

Isabella pressed her lips together but didn't want to say more, because Sebastian was her boss and they had once been involved. Although he was unaware, Isabella still couldn't let it go. Isabella didn't want to tell him the truth, and she didn't want to have any relationship with him.

Sebastian was very smart and saw through Isabella's thoughts at just a glance. "Alright. Did you apply medicine to your shoulder?"

"I did," Isabella said. "I applied it in the bathroom myself."

"Okay." Sebastian didn't want to scare her, so he grabbed his briefcase. "Shall we go then?"

However, Isabella stopped. "You go ahead, Mr. Landon."

Sebastian turned to look at her and asked, "What's wrong?"

Isabella shook her head. "Nothing."

She just didn't want anyone else to get the wrong idea about her relationship with Sebastian. She didn't mind, but she didn't want to bring Sebastian unnecessary trouble.

During their brief conversation, Sebastian felt that she had been deliberately keeping her distance from him and couldn't help but feel disappointed. "Alright, stay safe. See you tomorrow."

"See you tomorrow."
###chapter 43 Marriage
Sebastian drove out of the underground parking lot and saw Isabella standing at the bus stop. As he thought about her rejection, Sebastian's emotions became complicated.

At that moment, Vanessa called him and asked, "Are you coming back for dinner tonight, Mr. Landon?"

"I have a prior engagement, you can do whatever you want."

"Okay then." Vanessa's tone sounded a bit disappointed. "Would you like a light snack at night? I can make it in advance for you."

"No need, it's not a habit of mine. You've been busy all day and you must be tired, so get some rest."

"Okay."

After hanging up, Sebastian sat in the car for a while. When he saw Isabella get on the bus, he lightly tapped the steering wheel and opened the phone book to dial Zaire's number.

"Where are you?" Sebastian asked.

"The Moon Club." Zaire's voice sounded somewhat seductive. "What's up? Are you coming?"

"I'll be right there." Sebastian hung up the phone and drove to the Moon Club.

*****

At the hospital, Isabella carried the oatmeal into the ward. Charlie was sitting by the bed, feeding Nina an apple.

This was a rare scene, so Isabella was slightly stunned. Nina was also a bit shy and asked, "Have you eaten, Isabella? Charlie brought dinner for you."

Isabella replied, "I've eaten."

She put down her bag and walked to the side of the bed. Charlie greeted her, but Isabella bit her lip and did not respond or even look at him. Instead, she looked at Nina and asked, "Are you feeling better now, Nina?"

"I'm much better," Nina said, holding her hand. "I just told Charlie that I'll be discharged tomorrow after another round of drip. It's too expensive to stay in the hospital, and I feel more at ease at home. I want to go home."

Isabella's eyes dimmed when she heard that. She knew that Nina would definitely not get a divorce.

She silently pulled over a chair and sat down by the bed, still holding the thermos in her hand.

"What's this?" Nina asked, noticing the thermos.

Isabella lowered her head and took a glance. She replied, "It's oatmeal."

As she said that, she opened the lid and scooped out a bowl for Nina. "Try it, Nina."

Nina was surprised. "You're busy with work every day. How did you find the time to make oatmeal? You shouldn't cook in the office anymore, or your boss will punish you if he finds out."

"My boss gave me this," Isabella answered casually.

Charlie, who was standing nearby, suddenly became excited and asked, "Is this from Mr. Landon, Isabella?"

Isabella didn't say a word.

Charlie just smiled and said, "That's great, Isabella. Your relationship with Mr. Landon is progressing quickly. I told you that Mr. Landon values you a lot. Be good to him in the future, and he'll definitely like you."

Nina quickly slapped him when she heard his excessive words. "What nonsense are you saying?"

Charlie mumbled, "I'm just telling the truth. Since I'm her family, I have to teach her how to handle herself. I wouldn't harm her."

Isabella frowned. She didn't want to explain herself to Charlie, but she didn't want him to get the wrong idea about Sebastian either, so she said, "Mr. Landon's girlfriend gave me this."

"Mr. Landon's girlfriend?" Charlie's smile froze. "Mr. Landon has a girlfriend?"

"Yes, they're getting married soon."

Charlie's smile completely disappeared, but he quickly regained his composure and said, "That's normal. Successful bosses these days often have many companions. You're young and beautiful. Even if he does get married, you'll still have a chance."

Nina interrupted him. "Charlie, I want some hot water. Please go get it."

After Charlie left, Nina asked, "Bella, is what Charlie said true? Does Mr. Landon really have his eye on you?"

Nina was worried that Isabella would go astray and afraid that she would be deceived. In Nina's eyes, Sebastian was a sleazy middle-aged man, and bosses like that often liked to flirt with young girls in the company.

Isabella shook her head, denying it. "No, he already has a girlfriend."

"He can still flirt with other girls even if he does have a girlfriend."

"No, Mr. Landon isn't like that," Isabella replied without realizing that she was instinctively taking Sebastian's side, afraid that others would misunderstand or tarnish his reputation.

Nina had heard a lot of those unspoken rules from Charlie and gave Isabella a few reminders before picking up her oatmeal, taking a couple of bites, and saying, "This oatmeal tastes really good. Mr. Landon's girlfriend is a good cook, but why would she make such delicious oatmeal for you?"

"He doesn't like oatmeal," Isabella casually replied.

Nina wondered, "If he doesn't like oatmeal, why would his girlfriend make it for him? Are they really a together?"

Isabella paused.

She didn't know how to answer that. She had also thought about that when Sebastian told Vanessa about his likes and dislikes. Vanessa said they had been together for over a year, so wouldn't she know Sebastian's preferences?

Although Isabella didn't like Charlie, they had lived together for several years, so she knew his dietary preferences.

But Vanessa's situation had nothing to do with Isabella. She waved her hand and said, "Maybe she's been busy lately and made a mistake. Is it really delicious? Let me taste it."

Nina scooped some with a spoon and brought it to Isabella's lips. Isabella took a sip and immediately felt surprised. She hadn't expected Vanessa to be a good cook. At the same time, she felt a bit sorry for Sebastian, who hadn't liked this delicious oatmeal. Instead, she was enjoying it.

After finishing the oatmeal, Isabella went to the bathroom to clean the thermos. When she came out, Nina was sitting by the bed peeling oranges.

"I peeled oranges for you, Bella." Nina pushed the fruit in front of Isabella, smiling indulgently. "You never liked eating oranges since you were young. I had to peel them for you every time before you would eat them."

As Isabella looked at the oranges, tears welled up in her eyes. "Are you really not going to get a divorce, Nina?"

Nina paused and looked up at her. "You're still young, Bella. You don't know how important marriage is to me. Charlie has a bad temper, but he cares about this family."

"But he hits you." Isabella's eyes turned red. A man who wasn't a gentleman must have a bad character. Although she wasn't married, she understood that.

Nina smiled. "He just pushed me a little; he didn't mean it. Besides, he sincerely apologized to me before you came. That's how marriage is, you'll understand once you get married."

Isabella felt a bitter taste in her mouth. "If this is what marriage is like, then I'll never get married."
###chapter 44 Warmth
"Don't talk nonsense," Nina grabbed her hand and gently brushed her cheek with her fingers. She said softly, "You're a good girl, Bella. You need to marry an excellent man. Don't worry, I won't let you go through the same hardships I did. I'll help you find a partner with outstanding character and prevent you from suffering."

Isabella bit her lips tightly and remained silent.

It seemed that Nina was speaking out of anger, but she was actually speaking from the heart. It seemed like society had already laid out women's paths in life. They were supposed to get married, have children, and then raise them at home. Men were the support of the family, and even if they made mistakes, they were worth forgiving. Marriage was not an expression of love, but a shackle placed on women. With that shackle, divorce was difficult.

And now, Nina seemed to be trapped in this shackle. Isabella knew that no matter what she said, Nina would not believe her. Nina wanted to give Charlie a chance because she still had hope for her marriage. Isabella hoped that Charlie would correct his mistakes and treat Nina well after this storm.

******

In the Moon Club, Sebastian pushed open the door to a private room and walked in with big strides, ignoring everyone else's gazes. He sat down and poured himself a drink.

On the couch, Zaire smiled and said, "What's wrong with you? You look so down, did you have a fight with Vanessa?"

Sebastian held his glass and glanced up at Zaire's suggestive expression, becoming even more displeased. "No."

"No?" Zaire took a sip of his drink and laughed even more freely. "Could it be that you can't fulfill Vanessa's needs so she kicked you out?"

Sebastian kicked him in annoyance and said, "Stop talking nonsense!"

"Alright, I won't talk nonsense. But I've said it before, we're normal men and we shouldn't suppress our desires too much. Sometimes we should relax. It's been many years but you've always been single and still a virgin. Aren't you afraid of damaging your body? Since you have Vanessa, why haven't you broken your vow?"

Sebastian looked at him and asked, "What do you mean?"

Zaire smirked mysteriously, "I heard you had a nosebleed at the company today. Maybe you're suppressing your desires too much, which causing that effect on your body. You're almost married to Vanessa, so why haven't you broken your vow?"

Sebastian was speechless.

He had a nosebleed because of that, but it had never happened before. Since the sexual encounter at the camping trip, his self-control had diminished significantly, and he had nosebleed because of that.

Zaire snatched the wine glass from his hand and laughed. "Why don't you put down the glass and spend a wonderful night with Vanessa? What are you doing here? You don't even like the girls here."

Sebastian didn't want to go home as he thought about Vanessa waiting for him. He picked up the glass again, ignoring Zaire's sarcasm, and drank the wine.

Zaire looked at him, raised an eyebrow, and walked outside. He stood in the corridor and dialed a number.

*****

Isabella had just walked out of the hospital gate when her phone in her pocket started ringing.

She took out the phone and saw an unfamiliar number from the local area on the screen. After hesitating for a moment, Isabella answered the call. "Hello? Who is this?"

"Is this Isabella?" The voice on the other end of the line sounded somewhat familiar, but Isabella couldn't immediately recognize who it was.

Isabella nodded and replied, "Yes, it is."

"Mr. Landon has had too much to drink at Moon Club. Can you please come and pick him up?" 

"Mr. Landon has had too much to drink?" Isabella was slightly surprised and asked, "But shouldn't you call Jack?"

"Jack has had too much to drink too. They're here together." Zaire casually fabricated a lie and continued, "If you don't come here, I'll have to send them out on the street."

After saying that, he hung up the phone.

Zaire looked at the phone screen and smiled. He thought, 'I want to see whether you're interested in Isabella, Sebastian.' 

Isabella held the phone in her hand, hesitating for a long time. Images of Sebastian being kicked out of the club, drunk and sleeping on the street, flashed through her mind. If any reporters took pictures of him, Sebastian would be embarrassed.

Isabella thought about the day when Sebastian had a few drinks and she had driven him home. She felt that she had to go since she was his assistant.

Isabella hailed a cab and headed straight to the Moon Club. When she arrived at the entrance, a waiter walked out. "Are you Isabella?"

"Yes, I am." Isabella asked, "Where's Mr. Landon?"

The waiter nodded slightly at her. "Please follow me."

Isabella felt relieved. It seemed that she was too late. They hadn't kicked Sebastian and Jack kicked out.

The waiter led her to a room and opened the door with a room key. He said to Isabella, "Mr. Landon is in here."

"Thank you." Isabella was worried about Sebastian and didn't think about it much. She entered the room.

It was very spacious suite, with enough room for five rooms. Isabella searched the place and found Sebastian in the last room, but he was taking a shower. The light was on in the bathroom, and she heard the sound of water. Sebastian's strong figure was reflected on the glass, which made Isabella blush slightly.

"Mr. Landon, are you okay?" Suddenly, the water stopped, and Sebastian's hoarse voice came through the glass. "Isabella?" 

"Yes," Isabella nodded. 

"Who sent you here?" There was a lot of moisture in the bathroom, and as Sebastian listened to Isabella's voice, her image kept appearing in his mind, and the desire that he had suppressed reappeared.

"I don't know," Isabella thought for a moment and said, "It was probably the staff here. They said you had too much to drink and asked me to come get you." Sebastian immediately understood that Zaire had set a trap. He gritted his teeth and said, "Wait outside, I'll be fine soon." He had been drinking and had fallen into Zaire's scheme. He definitely couldn't drive home himself. Since Isabella was here, he would let her take him back after he finished his cold shower and suppressed his desires.

"Okay," Isabella agreed and waited outside. 

She stood up to wait for Sebastian, but he was taking too long in the shower, so she sat down on the sofa by the window to wait. 

There was a strange smell in the room that felt pleasant to her nose. Isabella couldn't help but take a few deep breaths, feeling the chill being dispelled and her body warming up. However, after smelling the scent for a while, she started feeling drowsy.

Ss Isabella had been sitting on the sofa for a few minutes, feeling her limbs become weak and uncomfortable, the bathroom door opened, and Sebastian walked out.
###chapter 45 Will You?
"Mr. Landon!" Isabella tried to stand up, but before she could, her legs weakened, and she fell back down. Sebastian had just finished showering. He was wearing a shirt with the top two buttons unbuttoned, revealing a faint pink hue on his exposed skin. When he came out, he smelled the scent in the air and felt that something was wrong. When he saw Isabella, he picked up his coat from the bed and said, "Leave, get out of this room."

"Okay," Isabella responded, but she couldn't stand up no matter how hard she tried. The more she panicked, the weaker she became. Sebastian walked over and crouched in front of her. "Can you stand up?" Isabella bit her lip and tried again, shaking her head. "No." Sebastian lifted Isabella up without hesitation. Isabella was very light, so Sebastian didn't have any trouble holding her.

Isabella smelled something on him but felt suffocated and her heartbeat began to accelerate. She licked her lips and felt her mind buzzing with confusion.

Thankfully, Sebastian quickly took her out of the room. He placed her on the couch and poured her a glass of water, feeding it to her before asking, "Do you feel better now?"

At that moment, Sebastian was crouched in front of her and Isabella was staring directly at his face. As he spoke, Isabella focused on his lips and suddenly remembered that wild night, causing her to blush. "What's happening to me, Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian didn't keep it from her and explained, "The scent in that room was an aphrodisiac."

Isabella was shocked. "How could that be?"

In her excitement, her face turned even redder and her heartbeat quickened. She had no strength to sit on the couch.

"It was a trap for me, but you innocently got involved," Sebastian didn't say Zaire who did it. He simply gave her an explanation to calm her inner turmoil.

As he spoke, he stood up and went to open the door, tugged it a couple of times, and found it locked from the outside.

Isabella leaned on the couch and watched him pace in front of her. Then, he came back to crouch in front of her, saying, "The door is locked from the outside, and we can't get out without the key. My cell phone signal is blocked, let me see yours."

"Okay," Isabella took her phone out of her pocket and handed it to him.

The phone screen lit up with a photo of Isabella and Nina. The photo had been taken in the summer. Isabella was wearing a white sundress and had shoulder-length hair, her smile pure and beautiful. Sebastian glanced at it and felt his heart flutter.

"How is it?" Isabella propped herself up with her arm and leaned over to see her phone. "Is there a signal?"

Sebastian happened to raise his head, and their foreheads touched.

Isabella froze for a moment, then lifted her head to gaze directly into Sebastian's eyes, her heartbeat accelerating. She was about to pull her head back when Sebastian suddenly stood up and pressed his forehead against hers, and they both fell onto the couch.

"Mr. Landon..." Isabella clenched her fists against her chest, feeling flustered.

"Isabella..." Sebastian's Adam's apple rolled as he lowered his voice. "Do you...want to?"

Isabella understood what he meant. Though she was feeling uncomfortable, she hadn't completely lost her sanity. She shook her head repeatedly, but didn't dare not look into Sebastian's eyes, afraid of losing her rationality under his temptation.

Suddenly, he turned Isabella's face toward him with his hand and leaned over her, his cheek marked with an unusual redness. "Isabella, would you hate me if we had a relationship?"

Isabella's eyes widened. She was unsure if he still had his sanity or if he was completely under the control of drugs. She felt that he was being too direct and it was not something he would normally say.

She bit her lip and after a moment, spoke up. "Ms. Field is waiting for you at home, Mr. Landon."

Sebastian pressed his fingertip against the corner of her lips and rubbed it forcefully twice. "If you're willing to be with me, I'll handle my relationship with her."

Isabella didn't understand what Sebastian wanted to do, but before she could ask, Sebastian leaned closer to her, their noses touching, and stared at her lips from a close distance. Sebastian felt like he couldn't control himself, but he was afraid of scaring Isabella, so he restrained his desires and slowly enticed her.

"You smell so good, Isabella," Sebastian tilted his head and rubbed Isabella's cheek with his own, his deep voice sounding in her ear.

"Mr. Landon..." Isabella gazed at the ceiling with a hazy expression.

She couldn't resist this temptation.

Suddenly, Sebastian kissed her earlobe and lightly suckled on it.

Isabella let out a soft scream, arching her body, trembling uncontrollably. She grasped Sebastian's clothes tightly, feeling like her sanity would shatter in the next second.

Sebastian continued to seduce her. "Isabella, say you're willing, alright?

"Say you're willing."

He persuaded her to say those words, whispering in her ear.

Isabella knew that he was losing control of himself.

She was feeling the same way.

Isabella tried her best to maintain her sanity with tears streaming from her eyes. She firmly pinched Sebastian's foot, and right as she nearly lost her sanity, she suddenly caught a glimpse of something glowing on the ceiling.

"Mr. Landon!" As she Isabella realized what it was, she immediately broke out in a cold sweat, her voice filled with horror.

Sebastian followed her line of sight and looked up. When he saw what it was, his face turned pale. He got off Isabella and walked toward it, stepping on a stool to take down the small camera attached to the ceiling.

"It's a miniature camera."

Sebastian knew Zaire had done this too.

Sebastian turned around and saw Isabella curled up on the sofa, her entire head tucked between her knees, feeling guilty. He had just tried to seduce her, but it was the first time he had ever been rejected, as he was usually the one who was tempted by the opposite sex.

Sebastian went to wash his face in the bathroom. When he came out, Isabella was sleeping on the couch. Her cheeks were very red. Sebastian reached out to feel her forehead and realized she had a high temperature. It seemed that she would have to endure discomfort throughout the night. Sebastian took out an ice pack from the refrigerator, wrapped it in a wet towel, and sat on a chair next to the sofa, pressing the wet towel onto Isabella's cheek to help lower her temperature.

Sebastian felt unusually relieved as he looked at Isabella's peaceful sleeping face. Soon, under the influence of the medicine, he fell into a deep sleep as well.

In Zaire's room, the screen went black after Sebastian disconnected the camera. He shook the glass in his hand and sighed, "What a pity! That was really exciting! But I couldn't see the whole process, what such a shame."

Setting down the glass, he dialed a number. "Tell Miley to come up and keep me company."

"Yes, Mr. Jose."
###chapter 46 Breakup
Sebastian didn't come home all night. Vanessa slept on the couch in the living room, wondering where he was. She picked up her phone and called Jack.

The phone rang a few times before he answered. "Vanessa?"

Vanessa frowned. Jack used to call her that when they worked together at the company. But Jack still wasn't showing her any respect now that she was with Sebastian.

Suppressing her annoyance, Vanessa asked, "Jack, is Mr. Landon with you?"

"Mr. Landon?" Jack paused for a moment but didn't answer her. Instead, he asked, "What's the matter?"

"He didn't come back last night, and I can't reach him on the phone. I'm worried about him. Is he with you discussing business?"

"Mr. Landon isn't with me, but he did have an important project to discuss last night. Maybe he couldn't come back because it was late."

"I see," Vanessa pondered.

"Well, if there's nothing else, I'll hang up," Jack said.

"Wait, Jack, was the oatmeal porridge yesterday good?"

Jack paused for a few seconds before answering, "It was pretty good."

"Really? I was worried I put too much sugar in it. How was the corn?"

"It was good," Jack calmly replied, as if he really had eaten the oatmeal porridge.

"Is that so? That's good." Vanessa's tone softened. "I'm fine now, I'll hang up then."

Vanessa's smile vanished as soon as she hung up the phone. She had not added corn to the oatmeal she had cooked, and her previous excuse for deceiving Jack had now been exposed. How could Jack not realize there was no corn in the porridge if he had eaten it? Clearly, Jack was lying.

The reason Jack lied was even simpler: Sebastian had given the oatmeal to someone else.

Suddenly, Vanessa remembered what happened yesterday in the office when Sebastian, asked Isabella if she wanted to have the oatmeal right in front of her. Although Isabella had refused at the time, there was a chance she had accepted it when Vanessa wasn't around.

Vanessa couldn't stay calm when she thought about that. She took out her phone and called Sebastian again. "I'm sorry, the number you dialed is not in service. Please try again later."

After hanging up, she immediately dialed Isabella's number. "I'm sorry, the number you dialed is not in service. Please try again later."

The same automated message infuriated Vanessa.

She then quickly called Laura. "Laura, send me the contact information of the new intern."

"Samantha? Why do you need her number?" Laura asked curiously.

"I want to ask her something," Vanessa said.

"What is it? Do you want me to ask for you?" Laura asked curiously.

But Vanessa was firm. There was no way she would tell Laura the things she didn't want to share. Eventually, Laura had no choice but to send her Samantha's number.

Vanessa immediately called Samantha. When Samantha answered the phone, she was very excited and showed extra respect when she addressed her. "Why are you calling me so early, Mrs. Landon? Is something wrong?"

"Samantha, you said yesterday that Isabella still lives in the school dorms, right?"

"Yes, why?"

"Are you at the dorms right now? I can't reach her on the phone, and I'm a bit worried. If you're free, could you go check if Isabella is in the dorms?"

Samantha didn't want to miss the opportunity to please Vanessa. She immediately agreed, saying, "I happen to be going back to the dorms, and I can be there in about five minutes. Just wait."

"Okay, take your time. No rush," Vanessa replied calmly. But after hanging up, she paced back and forth in the living room.

Five minutes quickly passed, and before she could call Samantha again, Samantha called her. "Mrs. Landon, I checked, and Isabella isn't in the dorms. Her bedding is untouched, so she definitely didn't come back last night."

Vanessa's speculation was right. She clenched her fingers and said, "Thank you, Samantha. You've been a great help."

As she was about to hang up, when Samantha stopped her. "Why were you looking for Isabella so early, Mrs. Landon? Didn't Mr. Landon come home last night?"

Vanessa was annoyed.

It didn't feel good to be exposed, especially since Vanessa valued her self-esteem. Her tone turned cold as she warned, "You shouldn't just say what's on your mind, Samantha."

"I won't, Mrs. Landon. I'm just worried for you. After all, I know Isabella. If she tries everything to seduce Mr. Landon, he definitely won't be able to resist."

Vanessa sneered, "She can't do that."

But Samantha retorted, "I used to think the same way, but Isabella is good at disguising herself. She only looks innocent. I trusted her too much before, which gave her the chance to seduce my boyfriend. She's deceived me once, Mrs. Landon. You need to be careful with Isabella."

Vanessa frowned and said, "Thank you for that reminder."

She wouldn't follow in Samantha's footsteps, because she was going find a way to get Isabella out of the Landon Group.

After hanging up, Samantha felt triumphant.

Matthew walked up from behind her and asked, "Why are you so happy?"

Samantha's expression turned worried again as she grabbed Matthew's hand and said, "Mrs. Landon called. She suspects that Isabella was with Mr. Landon last night. I just started there but I already heard rumors about Mr. Landon and Isabella. Could Mr. Landon really like Isabella?"

"That's impossible!" Matthew answered decisively, even a bit too conclusively.

Samantha looked at him strangely and asked, "How do you know?"

Matthew remained silent for a moment and then asked back, "Didn't you say Mr. Landon already has someone?"

"Yes. She used to be in the assistant department, and she's average-looking at best. But since she managed to stand out from the group of assistants to become Mr. Landon's girlfriend, there must be something outstanding about her. Why were you so certain that Mr. Landon doesn't like Isabella?"

"I'm not certain. It was just a gut feeling."

"A gut feeling? What gut feeling?"

Matthew didn't answer and changed the topic.

After calming Samantha down and dropping her off at class, Matthew sat in the car for a while. At this moment, his phone rang, and he glanced at the caller ID before answering. "Mom..."

Emma said, "It's your birthday today, Matthew. Are you and Isabella coming back for dinner? I've prepared Isabella's favorite food. Your dad won't be working late tonight, and I haven't seen Isabella in a long time. I really miss her."

Matthew remained silent for a long time before finally speaking, "Mom, Isabella and I broke up."
###chapter 47 Tragedy
In a luxurious suite at the Moon Club, Isabella woke up on the bed, covered by a thin blanket and holding onto the sleeve of Sebastian's suit jacket. She looked around but couldn't find Sebastian anywhere.

Her phone was right next to her, but there still wasn't any signal.

When Isabella got out of bed, the doorbell rang.

She went to open the door and found a waiter standing outside.

"Hello, Ms. Miller. Mr. Landon sent this," the waiter said.

The waiter had brought her a delicious breakfast on a tray, with a note written in Sebastian's handwriting. "I'm heading back to the office. You should have breakfast and get some rest at home. I'll give you a day off without deducting your salary."

At that moment, Isabella checked the clock and realized it was already past nine. She supposed the bed in the suite had been too comfortable and had made her oversleep.

Isabella quickly finished her breakfast and hurried back to school from the Moon Club.

While she showered, her phone kept on ringing. Isabella subconsciously felt that today was an important day, but she suddenly couldn't remember what it was.

After she finished showering and picked up her phone, she saw the notification for Matthew's birthday on the screen.

She and Matthew had broken up too hastily, and she had forgotten to cancel the event.

But this day was no longer important to her.

After deleting the event, Isabella put on her coat, grabbed her canvas bag, and spent the whole day at the school library.

Reading helped her calm down, and her thoughts disappeared. She felt incredibly relaxed.

A large field was next to the library, and not far away was a clear artificial lake.

The trees were lush, and the lake rippled with the reflection of the setting sun, creating a peaceful atmosphere. Isabella wanted to experience that beauty up close, so she walked toward it.

It was lunchtime, so there weren't many students by the lake. Isabella rounded a small hill and planned to sit on a bench by the lake. But as soon as she approached the bench, she saw a couple lying in the grass and kissing.

Isabella was momentarily stunned. She had seen many college students in relationships, and she had experienced love before.

But even so, she still felt awkward every time she saw a scene like that. She didn't want to disturb them and silently turned around to leave, but Leo noticed her.

Leo glanced up and immediately saw Isabella.

When Isabella saw Leo's face, she was taken aback.

Leo? Why was it him again? Why was he always kissing different girls whenever they met?

Isabella wanted to leave, but Leo kept staring at her, causing her to involuntarily stop.

The girl beneath him gave him a dissatisfied punch and coquettishly said, "Why did you stop, Mr. Anderson? Keep going, I still want to kiss you."

As the girl spoke, she stretched out her arms and climbed onto Leo's neck, pressing herself against him.

While the girl kissed Leo passionately, he maintained his position, using one hand to support himself the ground and staring straight at Isabella. He let the girl cling to him, but showed no response, appearing unusually calm.

Isabella felt uncomfortable. She averted her gaze and stood still for a few seconds before turning and leaving.

She walked quickly, not daring to look back, afraid that Leo would call out to her.

When she was almost at the library, Isabella stopped and took a deep breath, clutching her chest heavily. 'This is so strange! I'm not the one who embarrassed myself, so why did I run away?'

So, she slowed her pace and walked through the library corridor. But suddenly, she saw another affectionate couple, Samantha and Matthew.

They were hugging and kissing each other, making all kinds of sounds. Matthew lifted Samantha's dress, revealing her underwear.

"Matthew, Matthew..." Samantha kept murmuring, her voice sounding somewhat hoarse.

Matthew pressed her against the wall, deepening the kiss.

Isabella watched and felt disgusted. She turned around, wanting to walk away, but she ran straight into someone else.

Before Isabella had a chance to apologize, someone grabbed her wrist and pushed her against the wall.

"Leo?" Isabella looked at Leo, who had suddenly appeared in front of her, unsure of what to say. When did he catch up to her? Why hadn't she noticed?

She wanted to leave, but Leo trapped her tightly with his arm. Leo leaned closer to her and smiled meaningfully. "How did you remember my name so quickly? Are you interested in me? Do you want to have a relationship with me?"

His words were very straightforward, but Isabella didn't find it strange. After all, he seemed like a thug and was always with different girls.

She defended herself anxiously. "No, you're mistaken."

"Is that so?" Leo squinted and glanced at Samantha and Matthew. "Do you know them?"

Isabella denied it. "I don't know them."

"You don't? Then why do you look so sad?" Leo stared at her with a teasing smile, as if trying to see through Isabella's thoughts.

"I don't know them!"

Leo sneered and said, "So, you enjoy spying on people kissing."

Isabella blushed. "No, I don't!"

Leo pinched her chin. "Can't you say something else?"

Isabella didn't want to say anything to him. No matter what she said, Leo would deliberately misinterpret her. Her chin hurt from his pinch, and she gritted her teeth, glaring at him fiercely.

But her fierce gaze had no intimidating effect on Leo. Instead, he just thought that Isabella's angry expression was adorable.

"So, is this how you usually seduce people?" Leo leaned closer, almost touching Isabella's lips.

His actions scared Isabella, who quickly turned her head to avoid his touch. She saw Samantha and Matthew on the other side.

"Do you see that girl?" Leo said. "Her name is Samantha, she's my ex-girlfriend."

Isabella felt shocked when she heard that. "What did you say?"

"Are you surprised? Do you know her?" Leo looked at Isabella's face and found it quite amusing. He had interacted with all kinds of girls, but Isabella was different from all of them.

Isabella bit her lip and said, "She used to be my friend."

"Really?" Leo raised an eyebrow, looking somewhat surprised, although his surprise was not very obvious.

Isabella continued, "And she kissed my ex-boyfriend."

Leo exclaimed in astonishment, seeming even more interested in this.

"Your ex-boyfriend is with your good friend now. Your experience is even more tragic than mine."
###chapter 48 Well-behaved
Isabella was speechless. She hadn't expected Leo to say such that.

She looked up at Leo. "If Samantha is your ex-girlfriend, why have I never seen you before?"

In fact, she had never heard Samantha mention Leo. Although Samantha was from a modest background, was very self-respecting and had turned down all the boys who pursued her. If Isabella hadn't seen Samantha with Matthew herself, she would have believed that Samantha was conservative. Leo didn't seem trustworthy, and Isabella had her doubts about his words.

"You don't believe me?" Leo saw through her thoughts and suddenly took her left hand, pulling her towards Matthew and Samantha.

Isabella tugged at him anxiously as she saw them getting closer. "What are you doing?"

"I'll prove it to you," Leo said meaningfully.

No matter what Isabella did, she couldn't stop Leo as his grip on her hand tightened. He finally stopped when they reached Samantha and Matthew, looking at them mockingly.

Samantha felt a gaze on her and half-opened her eyes to see Leo's face, which scared her so much that she immediately widened her eyes, exclaiming and retreating into Matthew's embrace.

"What's wrong?" Matthew stopped and turned around, looking at Isabella for a moment, then leaning on Samantha while catching his breath.

Isabella looked away, staring at her shoes. If Leo hadn't been holding onto her, she would have left a long time ago.

"Fancy meeting you here," Leo casually spoke, smiling.

Matthew got off Samantha and they straightened their clothes. Samantha adjusted her emotions. When she looked at Leo again, her gaze had returned to normal. However, she didn't greet Leo, but instead looked at Isabella. "Who's this, Bella?"

"What's wrong? Did you forget me so soon?" Leo immediately chimed in, looking at Samantha provocatively.

Samantha quickly said, "Do we know each other?"

Leo smiled slightly and said, "You didn't say that when you were lying naked next to me."

Samantha hadn't expected Leo to be so blunt. Her expression changed as she angrily said, "What are you talking about? I don't know you. There's no grudge between us. Why are you slandering me?"

"Slandering?" Leo took out his phone and said, "I have videos and photos. Do you want to see?"

Samantha immediately reached out to grab the phone, but Leo was prepared and easily avoided her fingers, smiling as he asked, "Why are you in such a hurry? The files are encrypted. You can't delete them even if you manage to grab them."

"How dare you?" Samantha was very angry and hurriedly explained to Matthew, "Matthew, don't listen to his nonsense. I really don't know him."

Matthew didn't say anything, but instead stared at Leo and Isabella's tightly held hands.

Leo laughed again, saying to Matthew, "Do you want my number, Matthew? I can teach you a few things."

As Isabella listened, she couldn't help but feel satisfied at Leo's sarcasm. Only Leo could say such shameless things. Since she had been a victim, she couldn't help but want to distance herself from Matthew and Samantha every time she ran into them. Leo had even tried to get Matthew's number. Isabella admired Leo's audacity.

Matthew coolly glanced at him and calmly said, "No need."

After speaking, he turned around and walked away.

"Samantha!" He didn't stop or turn back when Samantha called out to him. Samantha glared at Leo before quickly catching up to Matthew.

When Samantha and Matthew left, Leo let go of Isabella's hand. He lowered his head, and his shoulders slumped. He looked somewhat dejected. All his earlier hostility had disappeared.

The change in him caught Isabella off guard, and she started to believe him a bit. "Did you really date Samantha?"

Leo chuckled self-deprecatingly. "What's the matter? You don't believe me? Do you also think I'm not good enough for her?"

Isabella hesitated and shook her head. "You appear to have questionable morals, but Samantha isn't exactly virtuous either."

Leo smiled. "You're quite amusing."

Isabella felt at a loss for words. "I'm stating facts. Samantha isn't faithful in relationships. You don't need to be sad because of her."

"She stole your boyfriend. Don't you care about that?" Leo asked.

"It bothered me quite a bit at first, but now I just feel disgusted," Isabella replied.

Leo thought about Isabella's words, looking at her thoughtfully. "I never expected you to be so unburdened and carefree. Even more so than me."

Isabella corrected him. "It's not like what you're saying. I just think it's not worth wasting my time and energy on them. Life is long, and I'll always encounter people and things that make me dissatisfied. If I keep worrying about them, how will I live my life?"

Leo smiled faintly. "Do you want to get revenge on them? Should we join forces?"

Isabella shook her head. "I'm not interested."

She had plenty of things to do, and revenge against Samantha was definitely not one of them.

*****

Samantha caught up to Matthew and tried to explain, "Matthew, believe me, I really don't know him. I've never seen him before."

"Got it," Matthew replied without stopping.

"Matthew, are you mad at me? How can I make you believe me? Isabella brought that guy here. They were holding hands. It's clear that Isabella deliberately set me up. Don't believe them."

"Okay," Matthew responded calmly, without saying anything more.

Samantha reached out anxiously and grabbed his arm, causing them to stop in the hallway. "Matthew, answer me, do you believe me or not?"

Matthew looked at her, devoid of any emotion, and responded, "That's not important."

Samantha was taken aback. "Then what is important?"

Matthew didn't answer, but the image of Leo and Isabella holding hands flashed in his mind. Isabella hadn't said a word from start to finish. She hadn't even lifted her head or made eye contact with him. She just stood silently next to Leo, unusually quiet.

For some reason, Matthew felt uneasy when he thought about that scene. It seemed like something that had belonged to him had been taken away by someone else and was now appearing in front of him, making him feel uncomfortable.

He had never felt this way before.
###chapter 49 Locked Out
"It's nothing," Matthew answered with a faint tone after a long silence, then turned and walked away.

Samantha didn't chase after him. She watched Matthew's receding figure and sensed his annoyance. Why would he suddenly become so indifferent to her otherwise?

Samantha no longer felt calm when she thought about Leo and what he had just said. She turned around and retraced her steps, but Isabella and Leo had already left.

Samantha took out her phone and dialed Leo's number.

The phone rang for a long time, but no one answered.

Samantha hung up, angrily returning to the dorm room.

Isabella was eating a sandwich. When she saw Samantha coming back, she just glanced at her faintly before continuing to eat the sandwich and watch TV.

Samantha walked up to her and said, "Haven't you gone too far, Isabella?"

Isabella frowned. She had no intention of paying attention to her.

But Samantha unplugged Isabella's computer. It was as if she had gone mad.

The computer screen suddenly went black, and silence fell in the dorm room.

Samantha held the plug in her hand, staring angrily at Isabella. "I know you hate me for taking Matthew away from you, but did you really have to resort to such despicable means to retaliate against me?"

Isabella looked at her calmly and asked, "Is Leo really your ex-boyfriend?"

Samantha was taken aback. She had exposed herself instead of getting any information out of Isabella. She looked straight into Isabella's eyes, her tone still strong. "So what if he is?"

"It doesn't matter," Isabella said indifferently. "I have no interest in your past relationships."

"Stop lying. If it weren't for you, why did Leo suddenly show up and say those things to try and scare me? Matthew has started doubting me and treating me coldly. Are you satisfied? Are you happy? That's your goal, right? Well, don't even think about it, Isabella! Matthew will never be with you, even if he leaves me."

Isabella looked at Samantha and couldn't help but feel a sense of strangeness. In her experience, Samantha always spoke gently, was polite to everyone, and knew how to maintain appropriate boundaries with other people.

But the Samantha she was seeing right now was completely different from who she previously was. She was acting like an unreasonable and insane person.

"Let me say it again, I have no interest in your emotional experiences. I'm counting to three. You better connect my power cord!" 

"Isabella!"

"One!"

Samantha clenched the wire in her hand, shaking with anger.

"Two!"

Samantha glared fiercely at Isabella.

"Three!"

Samantha smirked and plugged in the cord, resentfully saying, "Isabella, since you've declared war on me, you can't blame me for being your enemy."

Isabella glanced at her, completely unable to understand Samantha's behavior.

Isabella lost her appetite for the sandwich and threw it away since Samantha's behavior had disturbed her. She took some clean clothes to the bathroom, locked the door, and started to take a shower.

Samantha's eyes filled with malice as she heard the sound of running water from the bathroom,. She turned around, took out a spare key from the drawer, and quietly opened the bathroom door.

Isabella was showering inside the bathroom and didn't notice Samantha coming in. Samantha quietly took away her towel and clothes, then locked the door from the outside and lowered the air conditioning in the bathroom.

After doing that, Samantha sat on the bed and waited. When Isabella finished her shower, found her clothes and towel missing and realized she wouldn't be able to open the bathroom door, she would definitely apologize and beg for forgiveness.

A triumphant smile appeared on Samantha's face.

At that moment, her phone suddenly rang twice. Leo had sent her two pictures.

Samantha opened them and suddenly stood up, staring intently at the phone screen.

She called Leo again, and he picked up.

Samantha cursed. "What the hell do you want, Leo?"

Leo's careless laughter came through the receiver. "Why are you so worked up? I have many more photos and videos like that."

"You're shameless, Leo!"

"You know my personality, Samantha. You shouldn't provoke me, otherwise, I'll send those precious photos to your boyfriend."

Samantha's attitude immediately softened as she restrained her anger. "What do you want to do? I can exchange money for those photos."

Leo chuckled and said, "I'll be waiting for you at the place we used to meet. I'll give you ten minutes. If I don't see you after ten minutes, I'll send those pictures to Matthew."

"I'm coming to see you right now!" Samantha picked up her bag and walked out, muttering, "I won't let you off the hook, Leo."

Isabella finished her shower and realized that her clothes and towel were missing.

She reached out to open the bathroom door, but it was locked from the outside.

At that moment, a cold breeze blew out of the air conditioning vent above her head.

She had just finished her shower and felt extremely cold as the cold wind blew at her.

Isabella pulled at the door a few times, but couldn't open it. She knew what was going on. "Samantha, open the door!"

There was no response.

"Samantha, don't be so childish! Open the door!"

No matter how Isabella shouted, there was still no response from outside.

Isabella shivered slightly in the silence. She thought about how crazed Samantha had looked and  figured it was possible that she had locked her in the bathroom until she froze to death.

Isabella didn't want to wait for help any longer, but she couldn't find any tools to pry the door open when she looked around. No matter how hard she tried, the door to the bathroom remained closed.

Isabella was in despair. Her phone outside rang for a while. Isabella tried to use her voice assistant to answer the call through the door, but it was too far away and the phone couldn't pick up her voice. After the phone rang for a while, the call automatically hung up.

At the same time, at the Landon Group, Jack put his phone down and said to Sebastian, "She still hasn't answered."

"What's going on?" Sebastian frowned slightly and said, "Go check on her. I'm worried about her."

He had left early in the morning for work and to avoid an awkward situation with Isabella. After all, he had lost control last night, so he had left the suite early to spare Isabella from embarrassment,.

Before leaving, he had left her a note and given her a day off. That meant she wasn't at the company all day. Sebastian couldn't focus on his work since he was constantly worried about her. His worry persisted throughout the day until the evening, when he asked Jack to call Isabella to check on her.

He didn't expect that she wouldn't answer Jack's many calls.

Sebastian's concern grew. He feared that Isabella couldn't handle the pressure and would harm herself.

"Alright, I'll go right away," Jack nodded in agreement.

As he was about to leave, Sebastian called him back. "Wait!"

After a moment of thought, Sebastian stood up. "I'll go with you."
###chapter 50 Regulars
In a hotel near the school, Samantha looked around for a while when she went upstairs, making sure that no familiar faces saw her. She stood in front of a familiar door and raised her hand to knock.

The door opened. Leo's hand reached out from inside, pulling Samantha in.

The room was not lit, and Leo pressed Samantha against the wall, starting to caress and kiss her. However, as soon as he kissed her, he sensed something unusual. Samantha was holding a fruit knife in her hand, and she had pressed the sharp tip of the knife against his neck.

Leo slowly released his hands, but still smiled. "Are you going to harm me?"

I didn't want to do this, Leo. You forced me to do it!" Samantha said fiercely. "Take out your phone. I want you to delete all the videos and photos in front of me."

"What if I don't?" Leo showed no fear.

Samantha persisted. "We were together after all, Leo. Can't we have a peaceful breakup? I've moved on and I've started a new relationship. Please stop bothering me."

"Bothering you?" Leo carefully considered Samantha's words and felt uncomfortable. "Samantha, you used to say that you liked it when I bothered you. You also said that you wanted to be with me for the rest of your life, no matter how hard the future might be. Have you forgotten your promises so quickly?"

"I haven't forgotten that, but I'm an independent woman and I have the right to choose. Leo, we were together for a while, but you couldn't give me a good lifestyle. How could I continue to be with you? Matthew can give me what you can't. I just want a better life. I'm not wrong for wanting that."

Leo laughed lightly and sighed. "So I'm worthless in your eyes."

"That's right, you're worthless! You were just a tool I used when I was bored," Samantha said angrily. She pressed down, and the sharp blade cut Leo's neck. Blood trickled down his neck.

Samantha saw the blood, but she only paused slightly and didn't show much emotion or remorse.

"Remember what you said today, Samantha." Leo took out his phone and deleted the two photos.

"Is that all?"

"Yes, it's only those two." Leo's demeanor turned cold.

Samantha didn't trust him. She took the phone and checked it again to make sure Leo wasn't lying. Then she threw the phone onto the table. "Stop bothering me, Leo. You're making me lose respect for you."

After saying that, she turned around and walked away.

As she opened the door, Leo's voice came from behind her. "I prepared a surprise for you as a farewell gift. I hope you'll like it."

Samantha glanced at him. When she turned around, she saw Leo leaning against the wall with a meaningful smile. She was afraid that Leo might suddenly do something to her, so she didn't dare linger and quickly left.

As she she hurried out of the hotel, she ran into Matthew. No one else was around them, and Samantha couldn't avoid him, so she suppressed her panic and put on a smile as she approached him. "Matthew? What are you doing here?"

When she came out, Matthew was looking at his phone. When Samantha walked over, Matthew turned off his phone screen. He calmly said, "I was about to ask the same. What are you doing here?"

"I... Samantha racked her brains and finally came up with a plausible reason. "I think I saw Isabella with a guy here, and I was afraid she might act foolishly, so I came to see what was going on."

"Isabella?" Matthew frowned slightly, seeming skeptical.

Samantha quickly explained, "It was the guy who was with Isabella today. He seemed sketchy, and I was worried that Isabella might be deceived, so I followed them."

Matthew asked, "Did you see them? Are you sure it was Isabella?"

"I think so. I saw them enter this hotel when I arrived, but after I went in, they disappeared," Samantha said, observing Matthew's expression. "Matthew, why are you here?"

"Somebody sent me a message, telling me to come here. They said there was a surprise waiting for me," Matthew raised his hand and showed Samantha the text message on his phone.

Samantha glanced at the number. It was Leo's number.

"It was probably a scam message," Samantha said, deleting the text. "Or maybe the person sent it to the wrong number."

"Understood," Matthew noticed what she was doing and didn't say anything. He put away his phone and said, "Let's go, I'll take you back."

"Okay."

As they drove past two intersections, Matthew's phone rang. He answered the call, then turned to Samantha, saying, "I'm sorry, I don't think I can take you back anymore."

"What happened?" Samantha asked.

"My mom wants me to come home for dinner."

Samantha pursed her lips and reached out to hold Matthew's hand. "Matthew, we've been together for a long time. When will you bring me home?"

"We can talk about it later," Matthew picked up his phone and helped Samantha get a car. "You should go back and rest."

"Okay." Samantha got out of the car. She understood Matthew's temper. When he was with Isabella, Samantha felt that he was gentle and had treated Isabella well, so he naturally took extra care of Samantha too. That was why Samantha had the opportunity to get close to him. However, she had realized that Matthew was actually difficult to get along with, even though she was his girlfriend now. He was still holding back with her Many. Samantha didn't want to anger him, so she got out of the car compliantly.

The taxi arrived quickly. Samantha opened the car door, waving at Matthew before bending down to get in.

Matthew left the car and turned the steering wheel, returning to the hotel he had just left. The front desk staff asked him what room he wanted to book. He took out his phone without hesitation and opened a photo from his gallery, asking, "Has this girl been here?"

The staff glanced at the photo and shook their head. "No."

"Are you sure? Take another look," Matthew said, bringing his phone closer.

The staff carefully examined the photo and shook their head again. "She really hasn't been here. She's quite pretty. I would definitely remember her if she had come here."

Matthew fell silent for a while and then found a photo of Samantha. "What about her?"

"She has been here," the staff said firmly.

The staff's confident response surprised Matthew. "Are you sure? You're not mistaken, right?"

"No. She comes with her boyfriend every month and stays for two days. They're regular guests, so I recognize her."
###chapter 51 Yes, She Has Been Here Once
Matthew was extremely surprised by that answer. He couldn't help but feel disgusted. "She comes here every month?"

"Yeah. We're a small hotel near the university, so young couples come here often."

"Thank you." Matthew hastily left the hotel. He sat in the car for a while, but felt an unclean smell in the air. He rolled down the car window, took a few deep breaths, and then dialed Emma's number. He said, "Hey, Mom, something came up, I won't be back for dinner..."

---

The temperature indoors had dropped sharply. Isabella wrapped a wet towel around herself and curled up in a corner, trying to avoid the draft. But even so, she still felt very cold.

Her phone rang intermittently. It was sometimes loud and sometimes quiet. After a while, Isabella felt that even the ringing of the phone was unreal. Perhaps the phone had never actually rang, and everything was just her imagination... If this continued, she might really freeze to death tonight!

Meanwhile, Sebastian and Jack had arrived at the entrance of the women's dormitory. As they were about to enter, the dormitory administrator stopped them. "This is the women's dormitory. Who are you looking for?"

Jack politely said, "Hello, we're looking for Isabella."

"Is it Isabella who stays in room 3202?"

"I don't know if she stays in room 3202."

Before Jack could finish his sentence, Sebastian said, "Yes."

Jack gave Sebastian a surprised look, wondering how he knew which room Isabella was in. It seemed as if he had been here before.

"You don't seem like students from our school," the dormitory administrator observed closely. Sebastian especially seemed like an important man. The administrator said, "You look familiar. Have you been here before?"

"Yes. I've been here once," Sebastian confessed.

Jack was taken aback. He hadn't expected Sebastian to have actually been here before.

"Hello! I'm Isabella's colleague, and this is our boss," Jack said.

"So you're the boss!" The dormitory administrator immediately turned and smiled when she heard that. She said, "I know Isabella. She's well-behaved, polite, and considerate. She's the most responsible of all the girls. If she hadn't refused, I would introduced her to my nephew as a girlfriend."

"I'm sorry!" Jack interrupted with a smile. "May we go inside to find her?"

"Men are not allowed to enter the women's dormitory. If you have something to tell her, you can call her and ask her to come down."

"We tried calling her, but we can't reach her phone."

Sebastian took a few steps forward and said, "I've been calling her, but I haven't been able to reach her. We were worried that something might have happened to her, so we came to check on her. Please let us in. We'll leave once we make sure she's okay. We won't cause you any trouble."

Sebastian was being sincere, and he seemed mature and stable.

"Oh, so that's how it is!" The dormitory administrator hesitated for a moment, then picked up a bunch of keys and said, "Alright, since you put it that way, I'm worried about her too. I'll make an exception and take you upstairs for a look."

"Thank you," Sebastian nodded slightly in gratitude.

The dormitory administrator looked at him and was very pleased with his behavior.

As they rode the elevator, the dormitory administrator asked, "How old are you? Do you have a girlfriend? My niece just turned twenty this year, should I introduce her to you?"

Jack tried hard not to laugh. He knew Sebastian was popular, but he had never seen someone offering to introduce a girlfriend to him before. He wondered how Sebastian would respond.

Sebastian glanced at Jack and casually replied, "Thank you for your kindness, but I already have a girlfriend."

The dormitory administrator was disappointed and said, "I'm sorry!"

"It's okay," Sebastian nudged Jack and said, "My assistant is still single. If you think he's suitable, you can introduce him to her."

The dormitory administrator immediately began scrutinizing Jack. Although Jack didn't have the same noble temperament as Sebastian, he looked decent and seemed like a mature and stable person. The dormitory administrator was satisfied and said, "Young man, since your boss agrees, what do you think?"

Jack just smiled and didn't dare speak.

The three of them went upstairs and arrived at the door of room 3202. The room lights were on, and the dormitory administrator knocked on the door. However, there was no response from inside. Sebastian said, "Ma'am, could you please use the spare key to open the door."

"Of course." The dormitory administrator quickly found the key and opened the door to room 3202.

The dormitory was lit, but there no one was inside. The dormitory administrator noticed that the light on in the bathroom and walked over. She knocked on the door, and asked, "Isabella, are you in there?" There was no response from inside. The dormitory administrator knocked harder on the door and raised her voice, calling out, "Isabella? Are you in there?"

Isabella thought she was imagining things. When the knocking grew louder, she realized it wasn't a hallucination-someone was really coming to rescue her! She tried to stand up, but there was no strength in her limbs. She opened her mouth and managed to utter a faint sound, "I'm here... help me."

When the three people outside heard the words "help me," they realized that something was wrong. Sebastian came over to twist the bathroom door handle, only to find it locked. He turned to the dormitory administrator and asked, "Do you have a spare key for the bathroom?"

"No," the dormitory administrator shook her head, saying, "Only they have the key to the bathroom."

Sebastian turned toward the bathroom door, saying, "Isabella, do you have the key to the bathroom?"

"I do," the girl's voice came through weakly from behind the door, "It's in the second drawer of the desk."

"In the second drawer of the desk," Sebastian repeated her words, and Jack quickly found the key. As Sebastian unlocked the door, he caught sight of a set of pajamas on the bed. He picked them up and handed them to the dormitory administrator, saying, "Ma'am, we're both men, so could you please go in and help her?"

"Sure." The dormitory administrator took the clothes and went inside. Sebastian and Jack waited outside.

Soon, the dormitory administrator helped Isabella out. As Isabella stepped out, she nearly stumbled. Sebastian quickly walked over, steadied her, and asked, "Are you okay?"

"The air conditioning in the bathroom was very strong; she must have caught a chill," the dormitory administrator said, "Help her to the bed so she can warm up quickly."

Isabella's legs were weak, and she trembled all over. Each step felt like she was walking on cotton. When Sebastian saw her condition, he bent down and lifted her up, carrying her to the bed and gently placing her down. He covered Isabella with a blanket and had Jack adjust the air conditioning to a warmer setting.

But even after all that, Isabella continued to tremble uncontrollably.
###chapter 52 Afraid of You Harming Yourself
"Should we take her to the hospital?" the dormitory administrator asked in concern.

Isabella shook her head and said, "No... no need... to go to the hospital... I... I have a blanket... in a while... I should be fine..."

She looked at Sebastian and said, "Mr... Mr. Landon... why... why did you come here?"

"I was worried about you," Sebastian looked at her and gently said, "I was worried that you would do something to harm yourself. But then I thought you were timid and probably wouldn't do something like that."

"Harm myself?" Isabella said, "I didn't... do anything to harm... myself."

"Then why did you lock yourself in the bathroom and turn the air conditioning so low?" Sebastian said angrily, frowning. It was unclear whether he was angry at Isabella or at himself.

Isabella said, "It was... Samantha..."

"Samantha? Did she do this?" the dormitory administrator said angrily, "That girl not only stole your boyfriend, but she also did this to harm you. She's very malicious."

Sebastian said, "Jack, call the police."

Suddenly, the back of his hand felt cool. He looked down and saw Isabella's hand reaching out from under the blanket. It was as if she had been looking for something but had accidentally touched his hand.

Isabella blushed and quickly pulled her hand back, saying, "I... I was looking for my phone."

"Your phone is here," Sebastian took the phone from the table and handed it to her.

Isabella took the phone, but she was trembling heavily, and she couldn't hold the phone properly, even though she was using both hands. It was hard for her to even unlock the phone.

Sebastian took the phone and said, "I'll help you."

"What's the password?"

Isabella hesitated for a moment, then told him the password.

After unlocking the phone, Sebastian showed her the phone screen and asked, "What do you want to see?"

"Call... call history."

Sebastian opened the call history page, showing dozens of missed calls, most of them from Jack, and a small number from himself. Of course, Sebastian had asked Jack to make those calls. There were also a few calls from another unknown number.

Sebastian pointed to that number and asked, "Do you want to call that number back?"

Isabella knew that it was Matthew's number. After they broke up, she deleted his number, and he never called her again. She didn't know why he had called her so many times today.

Isabella shook her head and said, "No... no need."

As she finished speaking, the phone rang.

Sebastian glanced at the number and said, "He's calling, do you want to answer?"

Isabella shook her head.

Sebastian hung up the call on her behalf.

Sebastian placed his phone next to her pillow and turned around to make her a cup of hot water.

Outside, Jack made a phone call to report the situation to the police. As soon as he finished, he saw Matthew.

Sebastian had a younger brother, but the only person in the entire company who knew about him was Jack. He had worked for Sebastian for a long time, so he knew some of the reasons why Sebastian had a bad relationship with his family. When he saw Matthew, Jack did not greet him. He turned around to push open the door of room 3202. Matthew's hand happened to reach out as well.

They both paused at the same time and looked at each other in surprise.

At this moment, the dormitory administrator came out. She was on the phone, saying, "Wait for me there, I'll be right down."

The dormitory administrator opened the door and saw Matthew. She immediately hung up and said to him, "What you did was really too much, Matthew! You cheated on Isabella with her friend Samantha when you were dating her, and now you want to harm Isabella. You and Samantha are a perfect match!"

After speaking, she didn't want to look at Matthew again. She turned to Jack and said, "Isabella has someone with her now, I'll go downstairs to deal with something."

"Okay," Jack politely nodded in thanks.

When the dormitory administrator left, Jack and Matthew entered the room one after the other.

The room had the heater on and was a little hot. Sebastian took off his coat and draped it over the back of a chair. He was bent over with one hand supporting Isabella's head, feeding her water.

When he heard the sound of the door opening, he turned around and glanced at Matthew, but his expression did not change.

Matthew walked over, looked at Isabella's pale face, and asked, "What happened to Isabella?"

Jack replied, "Samantha locked her in the bathroom, turned on the air conditioning, and planned to freeze her to death. We couldn't reach her on the phone, so we stopped by to check on her. Otherwise, who knows what would have happened if she had been trapped inside overnight."

If someone was trapped in there for even a few hours, they would freeze to death. It was really hard to understand how a girl could have such a wicked idea!

Matthew asked in shock, "Did Samantha do this?"

"I've already reported this to the police. They'll be here soon. I believe they'll find out the truth," Jack said coldly.

No one can interfere in matters of love, but if Matthew helped Samantha with this, he would really have been blinded by love and be unable to distinguish right from wrong.

A silence fell over the room. Suddenly, Matthew's phone rang. He glanced at his phone and answered the call. "Hello."

Samantha's voice came through the receiver. "Matthew, I just got home. Are you home yet?"

Matthew stayed quiet for a few seconds and said, "I'm in your dorm."

"My dorm?" Samantha asked in panic. "Why are you at the dorm?"

"If I hadn't come here, how would I have found out you tried to freeze someone to death in the bathroom?" Matthew's voice sounded calm but cold.

"Matthew, what are you saying? I don't understand you." 

"It doesn't matter if you don't understand. The police have been called, so you can explain yourself to them," Matthew said and hung up.

Samantha wanted to call him again, but the police were already calling her.

---

Half an hour later, the police arrived with Samantha.

An officer took statements from everyone and, after understanding what happened, looked at Samantha and asked, "Are you saying it wasn't intentional?"

"I really didn't mean to do that," Samantha said as she cried. "I was just trying to play a joke on Isabella. But something came up suddenly. I went out and ran into my boyfriend, so I forgot about it. I really didn't mean to do it, please believe me!"

"I really didn't mean to do it, Matthew. Please believe me!" Samantha reached out to grab Matthew's sleeve, but he avoided her disdainfully.

Samantha looked at Jack, but Jack just looked out the window.

She turned to Sebastian, knowing that the key to this whole thing lay with him. Samantha kneeled in front of Sebastian.
###chapter 53 If Only It Was You That Night
"Mr. Landon, please believe me! I really didn't mean to do it!" Samantha cried.

But Sebastian didn't even look at her. His gaze was fixed on Isabella. He said, "You know what to do, Jack."

"Yes, Mr. Landon," Jack said. He turned to Samantha and said, "Come with us to the police station, Ms. Cook."

As Matthew was about to speak, Samantha suddenly said, "Mr. Landon, Ms. Field who told me to do all this. You should be arresting her!"

As Samantha spoke, she took out her phone, opened her message records, and said, "This is a message Ms. Field sent me, telling me to do that! It really has nothing to do with me!"

Jack picked up the phone and looked at it. It really was from Vanessa's number, and the message said:

Samantha: [Ms. Field, Isabella and I are in the same dorm. If you need anything, just let me know! I can do anything!]

Vanessa: [Oh? Make her disappear then!]

Those sentences didn't explain much, but they at least proved that the whole thing was related to Vanessa.

"Mr. Landon." Jack handed the phone to Sebastian.

Isabella listened from the bed. Even though she didn't know what the message said, she could tell that Sebastian was very unhappy. Isabella also didn't know that this was actually related to Vanessa. After all, Sebastian treated her well, and she didn't want to ruin someone else's relationship. So she said to Sebastian, "I don't want to pursue this matter anymore, Mr. Landon."

"You don't want to pursue it?" Sebastian looked at her, not quite understanding why she would do this. "They almost killed you!"

Isabella shook her head and said, "I don't want to pursue it, let's just leave it at that."

Samantha felt very proud of herself. She knew that Sebastian would definitely protect Vanessa!

"What if I insisted on pursuing it?" Sebastian said.

Isabella was taken aback. This involved Vanessa, and she didn't want to make things difficult for Sebastian. She hadn't expected him to say that. It surprised her.

"We're all adults. You should take responsibility for what you've done. We can't just let something like this go because of me," Sebastian said. He turned to Jack and said, "We should let the police handle this."

"Alright." Jack looked at Sebastian, admiring his boss even more. Samantha was wrong. She thought that if she involved Vanessa in this, Sebastian would find a way to stop Isabella from pursuing it. She didn't know that Sebastian was someone with a sense of justice and that personal feelings would not affect his moral standards.

In the end, the police took Samantha away.

Jack and Matthew left as well, which left only Isabella and Sebastian in the dormitory.

Isabella looked at Sebastian, feeling complicated.

Sebastian couldn't help but smile when he noticed her staring at him and said, "Are you dissatisfied with how I handled this?"

Isabella shook her head and said, "Actually, you didn't need to do this."

"What do you mean?"

Isabella thought for a moment and said, "You didn't protect your family."

After hearing that, Sebastian thought for a while and said, "Vanessa and I aren't family. Don't overthink it. You don't need to feel guilty about this."

In his heart, Vanessa had nothing to do with "family."

Isabella didn't understand his meaning and asked, "Aren't you planning to get married? You're about to become a married couple, how isn't that "family"?"

"Marriage?" Sebastian laughed helplessly and asked, "Did she tell you that?"

Isabella didn't dare answer. She was afraid of damaging his relationship with Vanessa, so she chose to remain silent.

Sebastian sighed and said, "I said it before, we're all adults and everyone needs to take responsibility for their mistakes. I have to do the same."

He was only trying to make up for his own mistakes with Vanessa. As for the rest, he hadn't thought about it yet.

Curiously, Isabella asked, "Do you make mistakes too, Mr. Landon?"

"Why wouldn't I make mistakes? I'm just a regular person," he replied.

His eyes made Isabella feel a little flustered, and she apologized. "I'm sorry, Mr. Landon! It seems like I always cause trouble for you."

Sebastian joked, "To be honest, I'm usually afraid of trouble."

Isabella thought to herself, 'So, are you saying I'm trouble?'

He chuckled and continued, "But somehow, whenever I encounter your trouble, I don't feel bothered."

Isabella clutched the blanket and lowered her head, blushing, unsure of what to say.

Sebastian's mood improved when he saw the faint blush on her pale face. He smiled and said, "Don't overthink it, I'm just straightforward. I don't mean anything by it, I'm just speaking from the heart."

Isabella blushed even more.

Isabella's body finally began to warm up now that the heating was on indoors. She secretly glanced at Sebastian and saw that he was still sitting in the chair, looking down at the electronic files on his phone. It didn't seem like he was planning to leave.

After a while, Sebastian moved slightly, and Isabella hurriedly said, " Goodbye, Mr. Landon!"

Sebastian paused and looked at her with amusement, saying, "Are you trying to push me away?"

"No," Isabella felt shy. Unable to meet Sebastian's gaze, she lowered her head and said, "It's late now, and you have to work tomorrow, so you should go back and rest early."

Sebastian turned to face her, tucked her in, and said, "I'll stay with you a little longer. I'll leave after you fall asleep."

"That's not necessary!"

"You're alone here, what if you have a high fever and no one takes care of you? It won't do," Sebastian said calmly but indisputably. "I'd still worry about you even if I went back."

Isabella seemed to have no reason to refuse.

"Don't worry, I'll leave after you fall asleep." Sebastian patted her shoulder gently and said affectionately, "Go to sleep."

He stood up and turned off the lights, leaving only a bedside lamp emitting a soft glow.

Isabella closed her eyes and listened to the occasional sound of him pressing the keys on his phone, and soon fell asleep.
###chapter 54 Mr. Landon Has Become More Easygoing.
When Sebastian finished handling the documents, it was late at night. He put away his phone and looked at Isabella's face, gently saying, "I don't know why, but I always feel like you have some kind of attraction to me."

He reached out his hand and touched her cheek lightly, sighing, "If it had been you that night, that would have been great."

-

On Jack's side, things also ended in the middle of the night. Vanessa and Samantha both denied intentionally hurting Isabella, and due to lack of evidence, the police had to let them go.

Vanessa got into the car. After the car started, she coldly asked, "Where is Mr. Landon, Jack?"

Jack started the car and replied, "You should ask Mr. Landon."

Vanessa sneered and said, "Do you think I won't?"

As she spoke, she took out her phone and dialed Sebastian's number. However, the phone rang twice before the call was refused.

She dialed again, but the phone indicated that it couldn't connect.

Vanessa angrily commanded Jack, "Take me to Harvard University! I want to see Mr. Landon!"

-

Jack ignored her and continued to drive quietly.

Ten minutes later, the car stopped outside Sebastian's mansion.

Jack opened the car door and said, "Please get out, Ms. Field."

Vanessa glanced at the mansion and angrily said, "I told you to take me to Harvard University, didn't you hear? Or are you deliberately ignoring me?"

"Sorry, Ms. Field, I only follow Mr. Landon's orders," Jack's attitude remained polite but distant.

Vanessa had no choice but to get out of the car. However, she immediately ordered a taxi with her phone and said, "It's fine if you don't take me, Jack! I'll take a taxi myself! I want to see if Mr. Landon is at Harvard University, if he's with Isabella!"

Jack was about to get in the car when he heard her words. He stopped and said, "I'd advise you not to go, Ms. Field. Mr. Landon definitely doesn't want to see you right now!"

"I'm his girlfriend, I have the right to see him! You're just an assistant, Jack, what authority do you have to command me?" Vanessa lost her sanity in her anger. She usually spoke politely to Jack, but she didn't want to pretend to be cultured anymore.

Jack glanced at her and lightly said, "It's up to you."

Then he drove away.

Soon, a taxi arrived and the driver asked, "Is this the car you called for?"

"Yes!" Vanessa opened the car door and was about to get in, but hesitated as she remembered Jack's words.

"Miss?" When the driver saw that she wasn't getting in, he asked, "Should we leave now?" 

Vanessa finally made a decision. She closed the door forcefully and said, "I'm not going anymore!" 

Even though she really wanted to see Sebastian, she knew Jack was right. Sebastian wouldn't want to see her right now. 

The driver cursed angrily and drove away. 

Vanessa calmed down outside for a moment before entering the villa. When she entered, she noticed that the living room lights were on and the TV was playing. Zoe was sitting on the couch watching a soap opera. The exaggerated laughter from the soap opera annoyed Vanessa, and she wanted to turn off the TV. But she knew she couldn't offend Zoe. She didn't know what the consequences would be if Sebastian found out she didn't respect Zoe. 

Vanessa took a deep breath and walked over to greet her. "Hello, Grandma." 

Zoe glanced at her and turned back to the TV, ignoring her. 

Vanessa tried to maintain the smile on her face and asked, "I saw that you didn't have a lot of dinner, Grandma. Are you hungry? Do you want me to make you a late-night snack?" 

When Zoe saw Vanessa's good attitude, she nodded and agreed to her proposal to make a late-night snack. 

Vanessa went to the kitchen. 

After a while, she came out with a plate of macaroni and cheese. "Your late-night snack is ready, Grandma." 

Zoe turned off the TV and walked into the dining room. She glanced at the macaroni and cheese before sitting down and saying, "It looks good, thank you." 

"I hope you like it, Grandma. I know you don't like me, but it's okay, I'll take good care of you." Vanessa said with a smile. 

Zoe picked up a spoon and started eating the macaroni and cheese. After a few bites, she suddenly asked, "Did you only make one serving for me?" 

"Yes, I'm on a diet so I don't eat late-night snacks. Take your time, grandma." Vanessa stood beside Zoe, suddenly thinking about a bad idea.

---

The next morning, Isabella slept until she woke up naturally. The air conditioning had been turned off, and the room was a comfortable temperature. 

As she put on her shoes, the door to her dorm room opened. A few girls from the neighboring dorm rushed in and surrounded her, asking her questions excitedly. 

"Is that your new boyfriend, Isabella? He's so handsome!" 

"Where did you find your boyfriend, Isabella? He's really good-looking!" 

"He's handsome and also really gentle." 

"You have such good taste, Isabella! Your boyfriends are getting more handsome and classy each time, we're so jealous!" 

Isabella caught the key point among all these questions and asked, "My boyfriend?"

At that moment, the door opened again and Sebastian walked in with breakfast in his hands. Everyone in the room instantly fell silent and looked at him.

Sebastian walked over calmly and placed the breakfast on the table, saying, "I bought you breakfast."

The girls all looked at Isabella, smiling suggestively.

Isabella felt a bit embarrassed and said, "Let me introduce you all. This is my boss, Mr. Landon."

The girls were all enthusiastic and reached out their hands to Sebastian, saying:

"Hello, Mr. Landon."

"Nice to meet you, Mr. Landon."

"You're so handsome, Mr. Landon!"

"Isabella is our Prom Queen, Mr. Landon, you have great taste."

Sebastian knew that these girls had gotten the wrong idea about the relationship between him and Isabella, but he didn't explain himself. Instead, he looked at Isabella affectionately.

That look made the girls even more convinced of their relationship and theycouldn't help but laugh.

"We shouldn't disturb them."

"Yes, yes, we have things to do, so we'll leave."

"Goodbye, Isabella. Goodbye, Mr. Landon!"

The girls all left.

"Goodbye." Sebastian politely and gallantly waved his hand.

Isabella was a bit surprised when she saw him like this. In her experience, Sebastian had always been a serious, noble boss. But recently, she found that Sebastian was becoming more approachable and easy to get along with.

Isabella asked, "Didn't you leave last night, Mr. Landon?"

"I was going to, but I found the door locked when I got downstairs. The dormitory administrator had already gone to sleep, so I had to come back here." Sebastian answered calmly.

Isabella could tell that he hadn't gotten a good night's sleep just from looking at his face. She felt guilty and asked, "Do you want to freshen up before going to the company?"

After all, he looked a bit disheveled now, which didn't quite fit his image.

Sebastian asked, "Can I freshen up here?"

In her heart, Isabella thought, 'You won't refuse, huh?'

"I'm the only one living in this dormitory right now, so of course you can," Isabella said. She handed him a new toothbrush and toothpaste.

"Thank you." Sebastian took the items and went to the bathroom.

Since she was the only one living in the room, all the cosmetic products on the washbasin belonged to her. Sebastian casually glanced at them and noticed that she used very affordable cosmetics, none of which cost more than a hundred dollars. Then he remembered that a few days ago, Vanessa had used his credit card to buy a skincare set worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
###chapter 55 He Stayed Here Last Night
Isabella was tidying up the room when she heard Sebastian ask, "Do you have a cup?" 

Isabella turned around and saw him standing at the bathroom door, holding a toothbrush. She walked over and took her own cup from the shelf, rinsed it under the faucet a few times, and said, "You can use mine if you don't mind."

"Okay." Sebastian took the cup and poured himself some water to start brushing his teeth.

It seemed like a very ordinary thing for him.

As Isabella stood at the door, watching his lips touch her cup, her heart started beating faster.

She realized she hadn't given Sebastian a towel, so she pointed to the pale pink towel hanging nearby, "That's my face towel."

"Okay." Sebastian nodded, looked at her through the mirror, and smiled happily.

Isabella quickly went back to continue tidying up the room, but for some reason, her heart was beating fast.

Sebastian cleaned the cup after he brushed his teeth. This was the first time he was afraid that someone would find fault in him. After cleaning it, he put the cup back in its place and hesitated before putting his used toothbrush in his pocket. Then he took Isabella's towel, a small but soft and clean piece of cloth, and smelled the faint soap fragrance on it. Sebastian held the towel in his palm but couldn't bear to use it. He looked up and saw his reflection in the mirror and couldn't help but laugh.

He hung the towel back in its place, bent down to wash his face with water, and walked out of the bathroom.

Isabella had finished tidying up the room and divided the breakfast into two portions, saying, "There's too much food, Mr. Landon. I can't finish it by myself, so we'll each have some."

Sebastian glanced at the breakfast and said, "Go get ready. We'll go to the company together after breakfast."

Isabella wanted to refuse, but when she saw that he had already sat down at the table, she had no choice but to give up.

Isabella walked into the bathroom and found that her cup and towel were still in their original positions, and there was not a single drop of water on the sink. It looked as if they had never been used.

She was a little surprised, but at the same time, she felt a warmth in her heart.

During breakfast, Sebastian said that his phone had run out of battery and had been turned off, so he asked Isabella for a cable to charge it. As it turned on, he received a phone call.

Sebastian answered the call and immediately became nervous, saying, "Okay, I got it. I'll be right there."

Hanging up the phone, he picked up his coat and was about to leave, but suddenly turned back to Isabella and said, "My grandmother is sick, I have to go to the hospital. You'll have to go to the company by yourself."

Isabella nodded and stood up as well, saying, "Is Mrs. Landon alright?"

"She had a sudden stomachache last night and went to the hospital. She's on an IV now. I don't think it's a big problem."

"It's normal for older people to have stomach problems, so you shouldn't worry too much," Isabella comforted him.

Sebastian smiled at her and said, "Okay."

Then he left.

After finishing breakfast, Isabella went to work. As she was about to throw away the trash downstairs, a car slowly stopped beside her.

The car window rolled down, revealing Matthew's face. He coldly said, "Get in the car, I have something to ask you."

Isabella said, "If you have any questions, just ask."

Matthew frowned and insisted, "Get in the car!"

"We don't have a relationship anymore, Matthew. I don't need to ride in your car anymore since we've broken up. If there's nothing else, I need to go."

After saying that, Isabella waited for him to respond, but when he didn't say anything, she turned and walked away.

A piercing honk sounded behind her. Isabella frowned and quickened her pace.

Soon, Matthew's car caught up and stopped a little ahead of her. The car door opened, and Matthew got out of the car and walked toward her.

He looked down at her and said, "Get in the car!"

It was early in the morning now, and there were always people passing by the dormitory building. It was awkward for the two of them to stand here. Isabella tried to calmly ask him, "What exactly do you want?"

"I have something to ask you!"

"Then ask me here!"

Matthew had no choice but to stop forcing her to get in the car. He stared into her eyes and asked, "Did he spend the night here?"

Isabella was taken aback and knew he was referring to Sebastian. However, she didn't want to give Sebastian any trouble, so she denied it. "No."

"No? I waited downstairs all night and didn't see him come out! He just left in a hurry!" Matthew questioned her, as if he was the one who had been cheated on!

It seemed as if he had forgotten that he had betrayed her, hurt her, and abandoned her!

Just the thought of Isabella spending the night with Sebastian made him uncomfortable, so he had run out to ask her what was going on.

He hadn't expected Isabella's attitude to make him even more upset.

Matthew grabbed Isabella's wrist and continued to question her. "Samantha told me that Sebastian favors you especially, and I didn't believe it before. But it looks like it's true! What exactly is the relationship between you and Sebastian?"

That last sentence sounded like he was certain they had a secret relationship, rather than a question.

Isabella was angry and wanted to pull her hand back, but Matthew grabbed it more tightly. She decided not to move. She looked up at him calmly and said, "Matthew, you have no right to question me. I don't want to answer any of your questions! Let go of me, or else I'll scream for help!"

Disappointed, Matthew shook his head and said, "You really have changed, Isabella!"

Unable to hold back, Isabella retorted, "You were the one who changed first!"

After saying that, she pulled her hand away from Matthew and ran off.

Isabella ran for a while and noticed that Matthew wasn't chasing her this time. The morning air was cold, and when Isabella took deep breaths, the cold air felt like knives, cutting her throat and causing her pain.

She and Matthew were no longer involved, but hearing him question her that way still hurt. After all, he had been her boyfriend for over a year.

It took her a long time to accept someone's feelings, and it took her the same amount of time to forget someone.

The harm Matthew had caused her might make her never believe in love again.

"Useless man!" Isabella cursed, feeling sad enough to cry.

Suddenly, a pair of dirty sneakers appeared in front of her, and a voice came from above. "Who are you cursing?"

Isabella looked up and saw Leo Anderson standing in front of her. It was a cold morning, and Isabella was wearing long pants and a coat, but Leo was only wearing shorts and a t-shirt. He held a basketball in his hand, and his face was covered in sweat.
###chapter 56 Who Cares If I'm Alive or Dead
When Isabella saw him, she instinctively took a few steps back and said, "What are you doing here?"

"I played basketball all night," Leo patted the basketball twice, grinned, and said, "I figured out the answers to some questions I couldn't figure out before last night. I just saw you when I came out of the basketball court. I wanted to say hi to you, but you ended up cursing me."

"I wasn't cursing you," Isabella said.

"Really?"

"Really."

Leo smiled and said, "You really have no reason to curse me. After all, I didn't betray you. I was the one who was betrayed."

Isabella looked at him speechlessly.

Leo glanced at her and asked, "Are you heading to work?"

"Yes."

He took out a key from his pocket, twirled it between his fingers, and said, "I'll give you a ride, how about that?"

Isabella was curious about what kind of car he had as she had never seen it before. But instead, he walked straight to a bicycle on the side of the road. He first put the basketball in a bag and hung it next to the bike. Then he took out a coat from the bike basket, folded it twice, placed it on the back seat, patted it, and said, "What do you think about this?"

Isabella looked at him blankly, feeling a little confused.

Leo sat in the bicycle seat and propped his long legs on the ground. He smiled and said, "What kind of expression is that?"

Isabella waved her hand and said, "I didn't mean to laugh at you, I just think your car is unique."

Leo laughed and said, "Are you always so subtle when you speak? My car is uniquely what? Uniquely run-down?"

Isabella was amused by his remarks.

It was an old and worn-out bicycle. The paint on it had faded which made it look like it had been picked up from a junkyard. She couldn't believe that Leo had a bicycle like this. 

"Are you getting on or not? If you're not getting on, I'm leaving," Leo urged her.

Isabella was about to say no, she could walk there herself, but then she turned her head and saw Matthew's car coming toward them. She was afraid that he would bother her again, so she got on the back seat of Leo's bicycle and said, "Let's go."

Leo turned to look at her, his expression somewhat surprised, and said, "Hold onto my waist, or you'll fall off."

Isabella carefully held onto his clothes and said, "I'm ready."

Leo chuckled lightly, said nothing more, raised his foot and stepped on the pedal of the bike. The bicycle started to move forward.

A downhill slope was just ahead. When Leo rode the bike to the highest point, he shouted, "Hold on tight! We're going downhill!"

As he finished speaking, he unexpectedly let go of the handlebars with both hands. The bike slid down at high speed without anyone controlling it. Isabella was so scared that her heart almost stopped, and she could only hold tightly onto Leo's clothes. The bike kept going faster, and as it was about to make a turn, Leo opened his arms, both feet still frantically pedaling, and let out a joyful shout, looking like a madman.

Isabella was afraid she would fly off, so she had no choice but to let go of his clothes and hold onto his waist with both hands. If she was going to fly off, she would drag this madman with her!

When Isabella held onto him, Leo hesitated for a moment, then he grabbed onto the handlebars, gradually slowing down.

When Isabella opened her eyes, she saw Matthew's car driving past them with the window half open. Matthew was looking ahead with a cold and serious expression.

When they arrived at the bus stop, Isabella got off the bike. Her legs felt weak. Leo looked at her as if he was still savoring what had just happened.

Isabella was helpless about what he had done and said, "Remember to get insurance for yourself."

He would get into an accident sooner or later if he rode his bike so recklessly.

Leo smiled and said, "I don't have money."

"If you don't have money to buy insurance, why are you riding around so fast? Don't you want to live?"

"Who cares whether I live or die?" Leo said coldly.

Isabella was stunned for a moment and said, "If you don't even care about yourself, who will?"

Leo looked at her, his tone becoming softer. "I told you to hold onto me earlier, but you refused. You waited until a critical moment to finally hold on."

"Don't get me wrong, when I held onto you, I was thinking of you as pig."

Leo was amused by her words and laughed loudly. He seemed be in a good mood. "You're quite, interesting young lady!" he said.

Isabella felt helpless. Why was he was calling her a young lady even though they were around the same age?

"The car is here," Leo said, raising his chin. "Stay safe."

Isabella boarded the bus. As she settled in and looked out the window, she realized Leo had already turned and left.

---

When Sebastian arrived at the hospital, Vanessa was feeding Zoe water.

"Mr. Landon, you're here," Vanessa said, setting down the cup and stepping aside.

"Are you okay, Grandma?" Sebastian asked Zoe with concern.

"I'm fine now," Zoe reassured him, patting his hand. "It's just been hard on Vanessa. She didn't sleep at all last night because she's been taking care of me."

After this incident, Zoe's attitude toward Vanessa improved greatly.

Sebastian looked at Vanessa and noticed her bloodshot eyes, a sign of exhaustion. It seemed like she had indeed had a difficult night.

"Thank you, Vanessa!" Sebastian said.

Vanessa shook her head. "You're welcome. I had to do it. I tried calling you so many times last night but couldn't reach you."

"I slept at the office last night and forgot to charge my phone," Sebastian said calmly.

"I see." Vanessa didn't expose his lie.

"I'll go downstairs and buy some fruit for Grandma. She mentioned wanting to eat some," Vanessa said, walking toward the door. However, after taking a few steps, she collapsed on the ground.

After a doctor's examination, it was determined that she had fainted due to fatigue from staying up all night and low blood sugar from skipping breakfast. Sebastian peeled an apple and handed it to Vanessa, saying, "Have something to eat."

"Thank you, Mr. Landon." Vanessa took the apple but started crying.

Sebastian was taken aback and asked, "Are you alright?"

Vanessa shook her head, looked at him, and said, "Mr. Landon, Jack took me to the police station last night and said the incident with Samantha attempting to harm Isabella had something to do with me. I really didn't know about that, and I didn't tell Samantha to do anything. That text message was just a joke. I didn't expect Samantha to use it as an excuse to harm Isabella. I'm sorry, Mr. Landon. I feel guilty every time I think about how I almost indirectly caused harm to Isabella. But I truly had no ill intentions."

Vanessa spoke while crying, looking extremely remorseful. She appeared even more weary since she hadn't gotten any rest during the night.
###chapter 57 Planning for Pregnancy
Sebastian didn't immediately answer her because to him, Vanessa's message hadn't seemed like a joke. However, he couldn't think of a reason why Vanessa would harm Isabella, so he couldn't make a judgment.

"Don't you believe me, Mr. Landon?" Vanessa said grievously. "Looks like you really don't trust me."

Vanessa looked sorry for herself as she cried, and Zoe couldn't bear to see it, so she spoke up. " I'm not exactly sure what happened, but the fact that the police were involved means it was investigated. If Vanessa really did something wrong, the police wouldn't let her go so easily."

Sebastian nodded and said, "I believe that this was unintentional on your part, but Samantha definitely can't stay at the company anymore."

He was cautious about hiring people. He had already seen that Samantha was not trustworthy. If it weren't for Vanessa's plea, Samantha would have been fired on her first day. After what she had done, Sebastian couldn't possibly let her stay in the company.

"Okay." Vanessa nodded and said, "I felt sorry for her last time, and I only helped her because Laura pleaded for her. I didn't expect her to be like this. It would be trouble if she stayed at the company."

After this incident, Vanessa and Samantha no longer wanted anything to do with each other. Samantha had done something foolish by implicating Vanessa to protect herself, so even if Sebastian hadn't fired her, Vanessa would find a way to make Laura get rid of her.

----------

Sebastian was at the doctor's office, learning about Zoe's condition.

"It's normal for the elderly to have gastrointestinal problems. From the test results, Mrs. Landon must have eaten something bad. It's not a serious issue, but we need to remind her to be careful with her diet. It could be serious if her gastrointestinal problems lead to other complications."

"Okay." Sebastian thanked the doctor and returned to the hospital room. Vanessa wasn't in the room; Zoe said she went outside to take a phone call.

Sebastian approached the bed and said, "The doctor said you can't just eat anything anymore, Grandma. It could lead to gastrointestinal inflammation if it gets worse."

Zoe innocently replied, "I don't just eat anything. I don't eat anything else besides three meals a day."

Zoe's diet was very regular, and she didn't eat anything other than some occasional fruit. If anyone said she ate just anything, Zoe would get upset.

Sebastian asked, "Well, think carefully about what you ate yesterday. If you had something you don't usually eat, it could have made you feel uncomfortable."

Zoe thought seriously and said, "I didn't eat anything else yesterday besides my three meals. Last night, Vanessa came back and made some macaroni and cheese. After I ate it, my stomach started to hurt after about half an hour."

"Grandma." Vanessa walked in, interrupting their conversation. "What are you guys talking about?"

"We weren't talking about anything important." Zoe obviously didn't want to discuss this matter further.

Sebastian thought for a moment and said, "I'm going to hire a nutritionist for the family, so we'll leave all our meals to the nutritionist from now on."

Vanessa nodded and said, "Alright. But I'll be even more bored then."

------

At the company.

Sebastian wasn't here today, so Isabella had less work to do. During lunch, she went to see Jack and tried to ask about Zoe's condition, but Jack didn't know anything.

Isabella wanted to visit Zoe at the hospital. After all, they had been in the same hospital room last time, and Sebastian had saved her again this time. Plus, she genuinely cared about Zoe's situation.

After work, she bought some fruit at the supermarket. As she was about to leave for the hospital, she received a call from Nina.

"Hello, Nina."

"Have you finished work, Bella?"

"I just finished. What's up?"

"I cooked dinner, but Charlie has a social event tonight and won't be coming back. Will you come over and have dinner with me?" Isabella could sense that Nina wasn't in a good mood.

Isabella had grown up with Nina, so she could immediately sense Nina's emotions. She replied, "Sure, I'll come right over."

Nina lived in a good neighborhood with good amenities. One of the reasons why Nina married Charlie was because Isabella knew that Charlie could afford to buy a house in this area. She thought he could provide Nina with a warm home. But now, it seemed that both she and Nina were wrong.

A man's ability doesn't necessarily have anything to do with whether he loves his family or not. The change in Charlie's attitude before and after marriage was the best example of this.

When Isabella got out of the car, she saw Nina waiting for her at the intersection.

"Nina." She quickened her pace and walked towards her.

Nina walked toward her with a smile and said, "Bella."

"I bought your favorite fruit." Isabella showed Nina the fruit she bought.
###chapter 58 Mr. Landon Was Getting Anxious
Nina smiled and said, "You just had to come over for dinner, why did you buy those expensive dried fruits? You've just started working and you don't make much, so you should buy something for yourself instead."

"It's okay."

The two sisters walked hand in hand, talking as they made their way back home.

When they entered the house, Isabella smelled a foul odor and asked, "Nina, what is that smell?"

Nina replied, "It's the smell of medicine."

"Are you sick? Why are you taking medicine?"

"Charlie wants a baby, but I haven't been able to get pregnant. I heard that there was a good doctor in China Town, so I bought some medicine to take." Nina answered.

Isabella found the smell unbearable and asked Nina, "Are you sure it's safe to take this medicine?"

"Of course it's safe. Don't worry about it." Nina didn't want to continue talking about it.

So she asked Isabella to sit at the dining table and said, "Just wait a moment, we'll eat soon!"

Isabella looked at the sumptuous dinner and felt that Charlie didn't appreciate Nina, which was really unfair.

As the sky darkened outside, the lights were warm, and Isabella felt an incredible sense of tranquility in her heart.

During dinner, Isabella asked, "Has your work been going well, Nina?"

Nina paused before saying, "I don't plan on working anymore, Bella."

Isabella was taken aback at that unexpected news. "Why do you suddenly not want to work anymore?"

"Charlie doesn't want me to work anymore." Nina looked a bit sad and helpless. "The thing he cares about the most now is having a baby, so he wants me to stay at home and focus on getting pregnant."

Isabella understood Nina's personality and understood why Nina had invited her for dinner today. She definitely hadn't adapted to suddenly being forced to give up work.

But having children was also important for a family after marriage. If Nina wanted to maintain her marriage with Charlie, having a baby could indeed ease the family atmosphere. After all, this was an issue between a husband and wife, and Isabella couldn't interfere. She could only comfort her. "It's fine if you don't work. You'll have time to do the things you want to do. And once you get pregnant and have a little baby, there'll be a lot of things to keep you busy."

"Yeah." Nina smiled and said, "You've lost weight again, have some more."

---

After dinner, the sky outside had turned dark, but the lights in the house were warm. Isabella helped Nina clean the kitchen. As they chatted, they heard the door open.

Charlie was back. When he saw Isabella, he smiled and greeted her, "You're here, Bella. I just bought some grapes. I'll wash them for you to eat."

As they were talking, Charlie put down his coat and briefcase, then turned to the kitchen to wash the fruit.

Speaking softly to Isabella, Nina said, "Ever since I bumped my head, Charlie has been concerned about me. He buys food for me every day when he comes back now."

Isabella finally relaxed a bit when she saw the happy smile on Nina's face. She glanced at the time and said, "It's getting late, I should go back."

Nina knew that Isabella still had some grievances toward Charlie, so she didn't say much and sent her off.

"Are you leaving, Bella?" Charlie walked out with a fruit platter and enthusiastically said, "Have a few grapes before you go."

"No, thank you, Charlie!" Isabella politely declined. Then she left.

Once the door closed, Charlie's smile disappeared from his face. He pulled Nina over and asked, "How did it go? Did you talk to her about that?"

Nina shook her head and said, "Bella's not having an easy time either. She just started working at the company without any connections. We shouldn't burden her."

Charlie immediately became unhappy. He said, "You only care about how difficult it is for your sister, but what about me? My mother was right after all, you just can't bear to burden your sister. But you're willing to let me bear all the pressure. I'm your husband, Nina!"

"What are you talking about?" Nina said. "Bella is my sister. If you don't like her, you might as well kick me out too!"

Charlie became somewhat irritated when he saw that Nina was angry, but he patiently reassured her for a while.

Nina had a good temper and quickly calmed down.

"Did you take the medicine today?" Charlie asked.

"Not yet." Nina didn't want to pay him any attention to that.

"I'll go get your medicine." Charlie brought the medicine to Nina and said, "Come on, take the medicine."

The taste of that medicine was really hard to endure. Nina reluctantly swallowed it, suddenly felt nauseous, and ran to the bathroom to throw up.

Charlie angrily said, "Can't you hold back from throwing up? The medicine is good for conception. Many people got pregnant after taking it!"

Rinsing her mouth with red eyes, Nina said, "I'm sorry, the medicine is just too unpleasant."

"Forget it. I'll go get your medicine again."

"Charlie!" Nina wanted to stop him.

But before she could say anything, Charlie interrupted her. "I know the medicine tastes bad, but please try to control yourself for the sake of getting pregnant!"

After saying that, he ignored Nina's discomfort and brought the medicine over again.

As Nina looked at the medicine, she felt like throwing up again, but held back and said, "Bring me some candy, maybe it will help if I eat some candy after."

"What a hassle!" Charlie impatiently went to the kitchen to some candy.

Nina looked at the medicine, unsure for a moment whether it was harder on her stomach or her heart.

Isabella took the elevator downstairs. As soon as the elevator door opened on the first floor, she saw Samantha.

Samantha was drunk and could hardly stand steady. When she saw Isabella, she sarcastically laughed and said, "Isabella? Why is it you again?"

Isabella didn't want to interact with her, so she wanted to leave, but Samantha grabbed her and said, "You're so annoying! Why do I keep running into you everywhere? Tell me, are you stalking me? You caused me to lose my job, and now you come to my house to witness me embarrassing myself!"

Isabella shook off her hand and coldly said, "I didn't stalk you, and I'm not interested in causing you harm. You rented this house knowing that I live at my sister's place just to make me uncomfortable, didn't you? Too bad, I don't live here anymore, so your schemes are in vain."

Samantha sneered and said, "No wonder I never ran into you after I moved here. So you got kicked out! Did you move back to the school dormitory?"

She was heavily intoxicated, her steps were unsteady, and she bumped into Isabella several times. Isabella couldn't tell if she was really drunk or intentionally behaving this way, but she was strong.

She bumped Isabella into the door. Isabella frowned as she pushed her away, saying, "Samantha, you're crossing the line!"

After speaking, she turned around and walked away.

"Isabella!"

Samantha's voice came from behind her. "You can't get rid of me!"

Isabella didn't stop and continued walking forward.

The next day, Isabella woke up very early and bought breakfast and fruit near the school. She took the earliest bus to the hospital.

After arriving at the hospital, she realized that she didn't know which ward Zoe was in.

So she took out her phone and sent a message to Sebastian: [Mr. Landon, which ward is Zoe in?]

As she sent the message, her phone rang. Looking at the screen, Isabella hadn't expected him to call her directly, so she felt a bit nervous.

After taking a few deep breaths, she answered the call. "Hello, Mr. Landon."

Sebastian's deep, magnetic voice came through the receiver, as elegant and pleasant as a cello. "Where are you?"

Isabella looked around and told him her location.

"I'll be there in a moment."

Isabella wanted to say that he could just tell her the room number, she could find her way there. 

But before she could say it, the call ended.

Isabella held onto her phone. For some reason, she felt that Sebastian seemed a bit anxious.
###chapter 59 Like an Embrace
Isabella was unaware of Sebastian's anxiety. He had received her message while he was shaving in the bathroom. After seeing her message, he instantly felt happy. He felt that typing and texting would be too slow, so he decided to call her back.

When he heard that she was downstairs, he couldn't wait to rush down to meet her. He was always meticulous in everything he did, including shaving. However, he hastily finished the remaining half of his beard, rinsed his face, checked the mirror for any issues, and then left the bathroom.

He had stayed at the hospital with Zoe last night. Vanessa hadn't arrived yet. Zoe had already woken up and was sitting in bed wearing glasses, reading the news. Suddenly, she caught a glimpse of Sebastian darting out of the bathroom, but before she could see him clearly, he had already reached the door of the ward.

"I'm going downstairs, Grandma," he said while rushing out of the room.

Zoe stared, taken aback.

Suddenly, Sebastian rushed back in, grabbed his coat from the sofa, smiled at her, then dashed out again.

Zoe was puzzled.

What major event had occurred? Her usually composed grandson was unexpectedly flustered.

-----

Isabella had been waiting downstairs for about three minutes when she saw Sebastian.

"Good morning, Mr. Landon!" She jogged over to him. When she saw Sebastian, her heart inexplicably quickened and she blushed.

"Why are you up so early?" Sebastian looked at her, his gaze involuntarily softening. "You have to transfer to a few buses to get here from school, right?"

"Three buses. But there are fewer people in the morning, so the buses are faster. It wasn't too much trouble."

Sebastian glanced at the coat she was wearing and asked, "Are you cold?"

Isabella shook her head and glanced at the black coat he was holding. She found it a bit strange since he had just come down from upstairs and probably didn't feel cold. Why did he have a coat with him then?

"Let's go in, it's windy outside." Sebastian pinched the coat in his hand and suddenly felt that the coat was bothering him.

"Okay." Isabella followed him into the elevator.

The hospital was crowded that morning, so the elevator was also very crowded. When they entered the elevator on the first floor, there was plenty of space. However, people kept getting on at almost every floor, and by the time they reached the tenth floor, Isabella and Sebastian had been squeezed into the corner of the elevator.

As more people boarded the elevator, everyone started pushing inside. Worried that Isabella would be overwhelmed by the crowd, Sebastian turned sideways to face her, his hands on both sides of her, forming a protective barrier to keep her safe.

"Could you please squeeze in a little more?" a voice came from behind, followed by another wave of people pushing. Sebastian felt someone push him hard, causing him to lose his balance and accidentally press against Isabella, embracing her tightly.

Since they were facing each other, it looked as if they were hugging.

Sebastian looked down at her and asked, "Are you okay?"

Isabella could feel his warm breath from above and instinctively looked up, coming face to face with his deep eyes. She felt flustered and quickly shook her head, saying, "I'm... I'm fine..."

She lowered her head, too afraid to look at Sebastian again. However, she could still feel his burning gaze from above, as if it was fixated on her face.

As Sebastian watched her quickly blush, he felt an inexplicable joy. And as he smelled the faint fragrance of shower gel emanating from her, memories of that camping night suddenly flashed through his mind, followed by a certain physical reaction.

Sebastian averted his gaze, trying to distract himself. But all that floated into his mind was the soft and coquettish demeanor of that woman that night, and he found it difficult to control his thoughts.

Gradually, people started getting off the elevator, and the elevator became more spacious. Suddenly, Sebastian's voice said, "We're here."

Isabella suddenly snapped back to reality and followed him out of the elevator.

---

When Zoe saw Isabella, she first felt surprised, then delighted. A kind smile appeared on her face as she pulled her to sit and said, "So it's you, Bella."

"I heard you weren't feeling well, Zoe, so I came to see you." Isabella placed the fruit and breakfast down and said, "Have you had breakfast? I brought some for you."

"Really? Just in time, I was feeling hungry."

Isabella placed the breakfast in front of Zoe.

"This tastes great!" Zoe took a few bites and couldn't help but praise the food. "It really is great!"

"It's from a shop near our school. It's been open for decades, and their business has always been good. Their ingredients are very fresh and the food is delicious, so I brought some for you to try."

"Thank you so much, Bella," Zoe said happily. "But the food from this shop is still not as good as your sister's cooking."

Isabella smiled and said, "Nina has always been a great cook. If you like, I'll ask her to make some food for you next time."

"Really? That would be great! I've eaten a lot of amazing food in my life, but as I get older, I prefer simple food. I really like the food your sister makes."

When Isabella saw how happy Zoe was, she said, "Nina has had some time off recently, so I'll call her later and ask if she can make some appetizers. I'll pick them up and bring them to you tonight."

"Okay!" Zoe immediately got excited and said, "I won't have dinner. I'll wait for the delicious food you'll bring me."

"Alright."

"Will that be too much trouble for you guys?" Sebastian asked, standing next to them.

"It's no problem, but I'll have to ask Nina if she has time to cook first."

"After you ask, let Sebastian know. It's okay if your sister doesn't have time to cook," Zoe said happily.
###chapter 60 Do You Like Me?
Zoe had quickly finished breakfast and she was now looking forward to dinner.

Zoe and Isabella were chatting, while Sebastian was sitting nearby, looking at documents. He thought that the atmosphere was harmonious and felt very happy.

Zoe's didn't really have an odd temperament, but not everyone could make her happy. As he listened to them carefully, he noticed that Isabella wasn't purposely trying to please her. She was just casually saying a few words could make Zoe laugh.

It was really rare to see that.

Just then, the door of the ward opened and Vanessa, who was dressed in a gown, appeared, carrying breakfast. "Grandmother, Mr. Landon, good morning!"

Her smile froze for a moment when she saw Isabella.

"Isabella?" Vanessa closed the door and tried to maintain a smile as she walked over and said, "What are you doing here?"

"Bella came to see me." Zoe held Isabella's hand and looked very fond of her.

Vanessa felt jealous that Zoe liked Isabella so much. She had tried so hard to please Zoe, but Zoe had always ignored her. Although she felt unhappy, she still maintained a proper smile and said, "So you and Isabella know each other."

"We met when I was last hospitalized. I suppose Bella and I are fellow patients." Zoe laughed very happily.

Vanessa felt very uncomfortable. She took the breakfast and said, "Grandmother, I made breakfast for you."

Zoe waved her hand and said, "I've already eaten."

"You've already eaten?" Vanessa turned her head and saw a disposable lunch box in the trash can.

"Bella brought me some food Bella, it tasted really good." Zoe said, "You don't need to prepare dinner either. Bella will come and bring me dinner tonight."

Vanessa forced a smile and said, "I should ask Isabella for advice and learn how to make you happy, Grandmother."

Zoe patted Isabella's hand and said, "I liked Bella the first time I saw her. She seems obedient and honest."

Vanessa thought in her heart:

'What do you mean? Am I not obedient and honest?'

Vanessa suddenly felt that it was a waste of her time and energy to please Zoe. She turned to Sebastian and said, "Have you had breakfast, Mr. Landon?"

"Not yet," Sebastian answered while stealing a glance at Isabella.

She had only brought one serving of breakfast! Zoe had just praised the taste of the food, and Sebastian also wanted to try it, but he couldn't possibly compete with his grandmother for food.

"I brought breakfast," Vanessa said and handed him a sandwich.

"Thank you," Sebastian said as he took the food, but he didn't have much appetite and only had a few bites.

"How does it taste?" Vanessa asked expectantly.

"It's pretty good," Sebastian replied, somewhat dismissively.

Vanessa smiled sweetly and said, "If you like it, I can make breakfast for you every morning from now on."

"Okay."

Isabella checked the time and said, "Rest well, Zoe. I need to go."

"Take care," Zoe quickly called Sebastian and said, "Sebastian, can you walk Bella out?"

"Sure." As Sebastian was about to get up, he heard Vanessa say, "I'll walk her out."

-----

As they walked out of the ward, Vanessa accompanied Isabella to the elevator. When she saw that there was no one around, she smiled and asked, "Bella, why does Grandma like you so much?"

Isabella found it strange. She had already asked that question in the ward, and Zoe had given an answer. She didn't know why Vanessa was asking her that again.

"Zoe and I just happened to share the same ward before, Vanessa. There's no other meaning behind me visiting her today. Don't get the wrong idea," Isabella explained.

"I'm not getting the wrong idea. I genuinely want to learn from you," Vanessa chuckled and said, "I guess it's because I've never had experience interacting with older people since I was young. I don't know how to make Grandma like me. To be honest, I'm a little jealous when I see how much she likes you."

Isabella knew that not everything Vanessa said was true, so she didn't know how to respond. Fortunately, the elevator arrived at that moment, and Isabella quickly said, "I should go."

"Alright." Vanessa didn't say anything more either. She waved her hand and said, "Goodbye."

Isabella waved back, and the elevator doors slowly closed.

Vanessa stood by the elevator for a while, her smile disappearing. When she turned around, she saw Sebastian walking toward her with his coat and briefcase. Vanessa understood where he was going and said, "Are you going to the office, Mr. Landon?"

"Yes." Sebastian glanced at the elevator and asked, "Has Isabella left already?"

"Yes, she's gone," Vanessa felt uncomfortable.

"Alright. I've arranged for a nurse for Grandma. If you find it too noisy here in the hospital, you can go back," Sebastian said.

"I don't mind the noise. I'm just afraid that both you and Grandma will find me unwelcome here." Vanessa lowered her head, looking somewhat sad.

Sebastian frowned and said, "Grandma really likes you now."

"What about you?" Vanessa looked at him, her eyes shimmering with anticipation, and asked, "Do you like me?"

Sebastian hesitated for a moment.

He didn't want to lie and had no interest in lying. But if he told the truth, he was afraid of hurting her self-esteem. After all, it was his fault for bringing her back to live with him. He had done that because he wanted to make up for what happened that night, and if they had feelings for each other, they could start a formal relationship. 

However, even though his feelings that night had been strong, he had almost lost interest when he saw her again. His feelings for Isabella were even stronger.

"I understand," Vanessa felt disappointed but still tried to smile, saying, "Mr. Landon, if you really don't like me, I have no reason to continue living in your villa. I'll pack up and move out today."

"Vanessa." Sebastian hesitated for a while and said, "I'll take you back tonight."

He should give himself and Vanessa a chance.

Vanessa was surprised and couldn't believe it. She confirmed it again, saying, "Really?"

"Yes." Sebastian's mood became complicated.

Vanessa's smile was sweet as she said, "Then I'll wait for you tonight."

"Alright." Sebastian looked at his watch and said, "I'm going to the company, see you tonight."

"Goodbye!" Vanessa watched him take the elevator down and felt extremely happy. It seemed that she had to prepare well tonight to make Sebastian fall in love with her completely.

---

After coming out of the hospital, Isabella immediately called Nina and told her about Zoe's illness. She asked if she had time to make some appetizers.

Nina immediately agreed and asked about Zoe's condition.

While they were talking, Isabella heard Charlie's voice. "Who's calling so early?"

"It's Bella."

"I need to go, Nina. I'll come pick up the dinner when it's ready."

"Okay."

After Nina hung up, Charlie looked annoyed and asked, "Why was she calling?"

"Bella asked me to help make some appetizers. She wants to take the food to the hospital tonight."

"Who is sick?" Charlie asked casually.

"Their boss's grandmother."

As soon as Charlie heard that, his attitude immediately changed. He said, "What are you going to make? I'll go buy the ingredients."

Nina had nothing to say about his change in attitude.

---

Sebastian drove out of the hospital and didn't see Isabella on the way out.

When he arrived at the company, he saw two unexpected guests sitting inside as soon as he opened the door.
###chapter 61  No Wife, No Child
"Brother Sebastian," Kelsey sweetly called out as soon as she saw him, getting up to give him a hug.

However, Sebastian, who was staring at Isabella's empty workstation, gave her a cold slove. 

Isabella hadn't arrived yet. 

Sebastian sat down, adjusting his cuffs and looking at Zaire. "You find me so early in the morning. Is there something going on?"

Zaire raised an eyebrow, gesturing towards Kelsey as if to say, "Your turn to perform."

Approaching Sebastian's desk, Kelsey pointed to Isabella's empty workstation. "Brother Sebastian, was that workstation specifically reserved for me?"

"No," Sebastian replied bluntly.

Kelsey pouted, "I don't believe you!"

It wasn't the first time she had been to Sebastian's office. Over the years, besides Jack, no assistant had truly caught Sebastian's eye. If this workstation wasn't for her, then who else?

Just then, Isabella walked in. As she entered, she felt three pairs of eyes staring at her. Isabella politely greeted them: "Mr. Landon, Mr. Jose, Ms. Jose."

"Is this Mimosa?" Zaire chuckled, glancing at Sebastian. Although Sebastian appeared unruffled, Zaire could sense a hint of joy in the slight raise of his eyebrow.

"Mimosa?" Kelsey laughed. "What a strange name!"

Isabella bit her lip and said, "My name is Isabella, not Mimosa. Mr. Jose, please don't tease me."

Zaire smiled without saying a word.

Watching Isabella take her seat at the special desk, Kelsey couldn't help but complain, "Brother Sebastian, are all your employees arrogant like this, speaking to clients without any manners?"

Sebastian didn't engage, calmly asking Zaire, "Do you have something to discuss, or are we getting to work?"

"There is indeed something," Zaire cut to the chase. "I heard they hired the assistant who came a few days ago. Kelsey wants to give it a try."

"The HR department downstairs takes care of hiring matters, not me."

"Whether you want to hire her or not is just a word from you, right?" Zaire, tired of Kelsey's persistence, rubbed his temples. "If you agree, I'll sign the cooperation deal we discussed last time. Forty-sixty, what do you say?"

Sebastian didn't respond immediately, tapping his fingers on the edge of the table, deep in thought.

"Bro!" Kelsey urged impatience.

Gritting his teeth, Zaire said, "How about thirty-seventy? Is that acceptable?"

Sebastian's fingers paused, raising his gaze slightly. "Twenty-eight."

Zaire's eyes nearly popped out. "What?!"

"Twenty-eight," Sebastian repeated.

"No way!" Zaire was rejected outright. "Thirty-seventy is the limit."

Sebastian smirked slightly. "Thirty-seventy is the contract's limit, not yours."

"Sebastian, come on, can't you leave me with something?" Zaire pleaded.

Sebastian addressed Isabella directly, saying, "Isabella, send Mr. Jose out."

"Twenty-eight!" Kelsey urged anxiously. "Bro, can you earn a little less for me?"

"It's not just a little less, my dear sister. Do you know how much one point is? It's a billion!"

Indeed, it's just a billion less!

"Just a billion. What does that matter compared to your sister's happiness?"

Zaire was truly astounded by Kelsey's love-struck brain. "No, if Dad finds out, he'll kill me!"

Pointing outside, Kelsey threatened, "If you don't agree, I'll jump from here right now. Dad will kill you when he finds out!"

Zaire was speechless about her behavior.

After more persuasion from Kelsey, Zaire eventually gave in. Sebastian smiled faintly and said, "Isabella, prepare the contract."

Zaire was almost exasperated. "Sebastian, why are you making so much money? You have no wife, no children, and are living all alone. You can't take this money with you when you die."

"Who said I have no wife or children?" Sebastian calmly retorted.

Zaire raised an eyebrow. "So good news is coming?"

"Soon."

Kelsey bit her lip. With her around, she wouldn't let Vanessa succeed!

Isabella printed out the contract and handed it to Zaire for signing. Sebastian called Laura again to ensure Kelsey completed the onboarding process.

Kelsey harbored a grudge against Samantha, whom Laura had hired previously, and immediately declared, "I don't want her to take me." Pointing at Isabella, she continued, "I want her to take me!"

Kelsey was not naive; she could tell that Sebastian had a special relationship with Isabella.

Isabella looked at Sebastian, taken aback.

"She's not available!" Sebastian refused without hesitation: "She's going out with me later. No time to take you."

Kelsey's temper flared: "I want her. I want her to take me!"

Sebastian frowned. "This is a company. Once hired, you have to follow the leader's arrangements. If you can't comply with this, the contract isn't signed yet; you still have the opportunity to change your mind."

"Brother Sebastian," Kelsey felt extremely wronged, tears welling in her eyes as she looked at Sebastian pleadingly.

Kelsey's display clearly didn't influence Sebastian. He said coldly, "Isabella, put away the contract." 

Despite her intense anger, Kelsey remained obedient in front of Sebastian. 

Zaire, having suffered a billion losses, found it worth it. No one in the Jose family could control Kelsey, but perhaps Sebastian could. With this matter settled, Zaire could finally relax. He signed the papers swiftly, fearing Sebastian might change his mind at any moment.

After Kelsey went with Laura to complete the induction process, Zaire left in a hurry. 

When Isabella heard Sebastian call her, she stood up. "Yes?"

Standing by her desk, Sebastian had his coat and briefcase in hand. "Come with me."

Isabella was puzzled. She thought Sebastian was making an excuse earlier, but now he was really taking her out.

As they got into the car, Isabella asked, "Mr. Landon, where are we going?"

"To Northhaven," Sebastian replied.

This was the first time Isabella had gone out inspecting work with Sebastian since joining the company, and she couldn't help but feel excited.

Sebastian glanced at her, a slight smile playing on his lips. Being with Isabella somehow lifted his spirits.
###chapter 62: So Nervous
This was Isabella's first on-site inspection, and she took meticulous notes. Sebastian, her superior, didn't hesitate to remind her of some key points.

Time has quickly approached noon. Isabella sat in the office, reviewing the notes she had taken, feeling very fulfilled.

At this moment, Sebastian walked over and asked, "Are you hungry?"

Before Isabella could answer, her stomach growled. She felt a bit embarrassed and honestly said, "Yes, I'm hungry."

"Let's go eat."

This area was somewhat suburban, and Sebastian took Isabella to a restaurant that seemed clean. He turned to Isabella and asked, "Is it okay to eat here?"

Isabella was not picky but was surprised that Sebastian asked for her opinion. It felt really good to be so respected. She nodded. "Sure."

At that moment, the restaurant owner approached them apologetically: "Sorry, our head chef is sick today, so we won't be able to serve you."

Isabella was disappointed. She was truly hungry, and on the way here, she noticed that this was the only restaurant nearby. She and Sebastian would face starvation if they couldn't receive any food. 

Sebastian looked at Isabella and asked the owner, "Are the ingredients fresh?"

"They are fresh, delivered this morning. The head chef suddenly fell ill."

"Since the ingredients are fresh, I'll cook." Sebastian handed his coat and briefcase to Isabella. "Hold these."

Both Isabella and the owner were surprised.

"Mr. Landon."

Sebastian had already started rolling up his sleeves. "What, do you think I can't do it?"

Isabella shook her head. She wouldn't dare say Sebastian couldn't do it.

She was just surprised that Sebastian could cook, and she had a little doubt about whether the food he made would be edible.

The owner handed Sebastian a new apron and led them to the kitchen. The kitchen was quite clean, but when Isabella saw the clay stove, she fell silent for a while.

The small restaurant's use of a clay stove was reasonable. But when Isabella saw Sebastian standing in front of the clay stove, it didn't seem so reasonable anymore. Sebastian, in his expensive suit with a spotless white shirt, seemed out of place in this setting.

"Isabella, can you add more fire?" Sebastian turned to ask her.

Isabella nodded. "I can."

After finding a place to put Sebastian's coat and briefcase, Isabella went to the bottom of the clay stove.

Isabella lit the fire, and the stove quickly heated up without a hint of smoke in the room.

"I didn't expect you to know how to do this," Sebastian chuckled.

Isabella also smiled and said, "I've lit many fires like this. I used to grow up in a mud house with Nina."

"A mud house," Sebastian said with a slight smile. "I've also lived in one."

"You've lived in a mud house." Isabella was truly surprised. Sebastian's status, his demeanor, his aura- none of it seemed like he had lived in a mud house.

"Yes. When I was young." Sebastian briefly mentioned it, not delving further.

But Isabella felt that when Sebastian mentioned his childhood, a faint sadness enveloped him.

Next, Isabella witnessed Sebastian's cooking skills firsthand, from chopping vegetables to washing them. He handled every process with ease. Soon, a variety of dishes bursting with colors, aromas, and flavors adorned the table. 

Sebastian stood by the sink, washing his hands, and Isabella brought over the utensils to clean. The sink was rectangular, spacious enough for both of them to stand side by side.

Suddenly, Sebastian turned to look at her, and Isabella instinctively raised her head. Under the sunlight, their eyes met, and Isabella blushed gradually.

"I'll wash the dishes." Isabella put the utensils in the sink to rinse.

"Don't move." Sebastian reached out, lightly wiping her cheek with his finger. "There's some dirt."

Before dinner, Isabella took out her phone and took a picture of the dishes on the table, focusing intently before noticing that Sebastian had approached behind her.

"Impressive."

Isabella sheepishly put away her phone. "You cooked the meal well."

Seeing Sebastian, who usually seemed detached from the mundane world, was a revelation. But now, not only was he so adept in the kitchen, but he also handles the clay stove with ease, She was surprised. And Isabella felt like she was getting to know a whole new side of Sebastian.

After the meal, Isabella and Sebastian went around to other places. When they were driving back, it was already four in the afternoon. Isabella said she wanted to pick up dinner from Nina's house. Sebastian asked for the address and drove straight there. When they arrived downstairs, Isabella unbuckled her seatbelt and said, "Mr. Landon, I'll go up and get it."

"Okay." Sebastian rolled down the window to get some air.

Isabella arrived at Nina's door and knocked for a while, but no one answered. She took out her phone and called Nina.

"Hey, Bella."

"Sis, are you not home?"

"My husband and I are at the hospital." Nina sounded apologetic. "I was just on my way to the hospital to pick up some medicine, so I brought dinner for Zoe Landon and forgot to tell you."

"It's okay." Isabella hung up the phone. When she turned back to go downstairs, she immediately saw Samantha standing next to Sebastian's car. Through the car window, Samantha seemed to be saying something, while Sebastian listened in a casual manner.

Isabella's heart skipped a beat, and she hurried over, "Mr. Landon."

She interrupted Samantha and Sebastian's conversation.

Samantha glanced back at Isabella but didn't say anything, then turned and went into the building.

Isabella watched Samantha leave, feeling a bit uneasy for some reason. When she shifted her gaze back, she found Sebastian quietly looking at her with an inscrutable deep gaze.

Once in the car, Isabella spoke up, "My sister has already taken dinner over."

"Okay." Sebastian drove away from the neighborhood.

Isabella felt his attitude had cooled somewhat, and her sense of unease grew stronger. Unable to contain herself, she asked, "What did Samantha say to you?"

"Nothing," Sebastian replied curtly, suddenly becoming more concise.

Isabella didn't press further, but she felt restless. Within a minute or two, her palms were sweating.

As the traffic light turned red, Sebastian stopped the car and spoke softly, "Isabella."

"Here!" Perhaps she was too nervous. Isabella's reaction was a bit exaggerated.
Sebastian chuckled. "Why so nervous?"

"I'm not." 

"Are you afraid of Samantha?" Sebastian wasn't a fool. Isabella was wary of Samantha, but he also sensed that she seemed a bit afraid of her.

"I'm not afraid," Isabella replied.

Sebastian gave Isabella a deep look but didn't say anything more.

Sebastian parked the car at the hospital, and as they got out, they saw Charlie and Nina. Upon seeing Sebastian, Charlie immediately approached and said, "Mr. Landon, I've heard so much about you."

Sebastian glanced at him and asked, "Who is this?"

"I'm Isabella's brother-in-law." Charlie introduced himself by saying, "Also the sales manager at the W.S. Group. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Landon."
###chapter 63 Almost Hit
Sebastian glanced at Isabella before extending his hand, polite and friendly. "Hello."

"I've heard that Mr. Landon is approachable and down-to-earth. Today, meeting you in person truly lives up to your reputation. No wonder you could start from scratch and build the grand Landon Group so successfully." Charlie was flattered for a moment.

Isabella looked embarrassed and quietly turned her head.

It was only when Nina mentioned leaving that Charlie stopped talking, but he still shamelessly handed a business card to Seb: "Mr. Landon, I heard you acquired the Northhaven property. Our W.S. Group offers great value and excellent service, albeit with a smaller reputation. If we're lucky, it would be our great honor to collaborate with the Landon Group."

Sebastian paused, then took the business card and said, "I will consider it."

"Thank you, Mr. Landon. We'll take our leave now," Charlie said, not forgetting to turn back and greet Isabella. "Bella, Nina, and I are heading back. Come over for dinner this weekend. I will cook your favorite dishes."

Outside the hospital, Charlie's expression soured. He withdrew his hand from Nina's grip, discontentedly reprimanding, "What's wrong with you? I hadn't finished talking to Mr. Landon. Who gave you the right to ask me to leave?"
Nina frowned. "Didn't you see Bella's expression?"

"What's wrong with her expression? She asked for the meal, which we specially brought over to indirectly please Mr. Landon. Is she still unhappy?"

"Bella has only recently joined the company. If you upset Mr. Landon, it will be Bella who suffers. Besides, you're not familiar with Mr. Landon. Loose lips sink ships, and speaking too much may not be beneficial." Nina said.

"What do you know?" Charlie asserted, "This is the way business operates. You must possess the courage to generate income. That's why someone like you will always be just a housewife, never able to achieve anything significant!"

Feeling somewhat inferior, Nina replied, "I don't understand. This is how my life will be, which is why I hope Bella can succeed."

"Look at Isabella, all timid and shy. If she succeeds, I'll write my name backwards!" 

"You!" Nina's eyes reddened, and she felt somewhat angry. She didn't mind what Charlie said about her, but when it came to Isabella, she couldn't tolerate it.

"Enough. Get in the car. Go home!" Charlie opened the car door, sat in the driver's seat, and immediately started boasting to some colleagues on the phone. Listening to their praises, Charlie became even more pleased. However, when he turned his head, he saw Nina still standing outside the car, glaring at him angrily.

"Aren't you getting in the car?" Charlie furrowed his brow impatiently.

At this moment, someone messaged him, [Charlie, after landing such a big deal, are you going to treat us to a drink?] One person initiated the conversation, and others followed suit. 

"Yes, this is a cause for celebration. Charlie, assistant manager position will be within your grasp, right?"

"I vote for Charlie!"

"Charlie, we're here to congratulate you. Where should we go for dinner tonight?"

Charlie's tail was practically wagging with joy. "Sure, my treat. I'll be there soon."

"No, you can't go!" Nina said.

Charlie impatiently looked at her and said, "I'm going to treat my buddies to a drink. Mind your own business."

With that, he stepped on the gas and drove off.

"Charlie!" Unaware of a turning car, Nina took a few steps forward and narrowly avoided a collision. 
The screeching of brakes pierced the air.

Nina froze at the shout, only to find two men in front of her, both looking fierce and intimidating. Richard Cole, the man standing behind Michael, appeared especially challenging to get along with. 

"I'm sorry." Nina tried to get up, but as soon as she exerted force, a sharp pain shot through her knee, causing her to fall back down.

A pair of hands reached out to help her up. "Are you hurt?"

Nina looked up and saw the somewhat intimidating man, Richard. She hesitated, retracted her hand, and supported herself with one foot. "I'm fine."

Richard furrowed his brow, then unexpectedly squatted down, gripping Nina's calf with his large hand.

Nina let out a scream of surprise.

After examining Nina's knee, Richard lifted her up and headed towards the hospital.

Michael, standing behind, was stunned. "Brother Richard!"

Richard slightly turned his head. "Park the car properly first, then come find me."

Entering the medical room, Richard made Nina sit in a chair and said to the doctor, "She's injured. Could you please take a look?"

"Did you register?"

"No."

"Please register first."

Richard frowned, and the atmosphere instantly chilled. With his demeanor, it seemed like he could dismantle the entire medical room.

The doctor, somewhat afraid, swallowed hard and explained, "We have to follow the procedure. Please register first, and I'll attend to her."

"Fine!" Richard turned to Nina and said, "I'll go register."

Nina nodded.

The doctor exhaled a breath of relief as Richard left to register. While tending to Nina's knee, he cautiously asked, "Is he your boyfriend?"

Surprised, Nina shook her head and said, "No."
"Oh, that's great. He doesn't seem like a good-tempered man. You seem quite honest. Be careful not to attract such men. They're hard to handle."

Nina explained, "You've misunderstood. I don't know him."

Soon, Richard returned from registering, and Nina glanced at the registration form, seeing his name written on it: Richard Mille.

Nina's jeans had a rip at the knee. The doctor made the tear larger for easier treatment. The ruin of a perfectly good pair of pants caused Nina to feel somewhat distressed. 
After treating Nina's injury and providing her with medication, Richard lifted her up again to leave.

Charlie was the only man who had ever held Nina.  She blushed at the unfamiliarity and said to Richard, "You can put me down. I can walk."

Ignoring her words, Richard simply glanced at Nina and continued walking, carrying her out of the hospital.

Richard's car was parked outside. When Michael saw him approaching, he quickly opened the back door. Richard then carried Nina into the car.

Richard asked her, "Your address," once the door had closed. 
Nina was momentarily stunned; he was going to take her home.

She waved her hand, saying, "It's not necessary..."

"Address!" With suffocating pressure, Richard furrowed his brow slightly. 

Nina hesitated for a moment before giving the name of the neighborhood next to her house, knowing Richard wasn't someone to mess with. 
As the car drove off, Nina politely said, "Thank you for taking me back. Goodbye."

She turned to open the car door, but it remained locked.

It wasn't until Richard got out of the car that he walked around to her side. Then Michael finally unlocked the door. Richard opened the door and reached out to pick her up.
###chapter 64: What's with the Innocence Act?
Nina took a step back and said, "It's been delivered. I can walk back by myself!"

Richard remained silent, staring at Nina with a gaze that seemed to devour her whole, making Nina feel uneasy. 
"Don't be so polite, big sister!" Michael in front impatiently interjected, "People who are polite to Brother Richard usually don't end well."

Similar to the previous instance, when Brother Richard threatened to sever someone's arm, the person persistently declined, displaying politeness for some time. This ultimately infuriated Brother Richard, leading to the dismemberment of his arm and one leg. 
Nina was speechless.


Nina had only heard that there were no positive consequences for offending people, but this was the first time she had heard that being polite to someone also had negative consequences. However, looking at Richard's demeanor, she realized he wasn't someone to mess with.

As a woman, Nina naturally lacked confidence. If she really angered Richard, she would be the one at a disadvantage.

After mentally preparing herself, Nina remained silent as Richard reached out to embrace her again. A gust of wind blew. Nina, who was only wearing a short-sleeved shirt, shivered.

Richard looked down at Nina and asked, "Are you cold?"

Nina shook her head.

Richard turned to Michael and said, "Take off your jacket."

"No need." Before Nina could finish her sentence, Michael had already swiftly taken off his jacket and draped it over her.

Nina was speechless.

Richard and she walked toward the residential area. "Which building do you live in?"

"A019."

When they reached A019, Nina randomly mentioned another door number. Before leaving with Michael, Richard dropped her off. 

Nina stayed upstairs for ten minutes before taking the elevator down. Not seeing Richard's car, she made her way back home.

As the car left the residential area, Michael couldn't help but speak up: "Brother Richard, I could have just taken her back. It was unnecessary for you to personally escort and carry her. If Ms. Johnson knew this, it could cause trouble."

Richard, sitting in the back, kept his eyes closed. Images of Nina involuntarily appeared in his mind. Upon hearing Michael's words, he opened his eyes, a hint of coldness in his gaze, and said, "Don't say anything to let her know."

"Yes, Brother Richard." Michael fell silent.

Richard withdrew his gaze but caught sight of a fallen medicine bag nearby. Frowning, he said, "Turn back."

"Understood." Michael made a turn at the next intersection and drove a few hundred meters before hitting a red light. As the car slowed to a stop, the pedestrian light turned green. Michael stared at the intersection boredly, then suddenly saw a familiar figure: "Brother Richard!"

"What's the matter?"

Michael pointed ahead. "It's big sister!"

Richard followed his gaze and indeed saw Nina limping across the street.

"Where is she going?"

Seeing Nina cross the street and head towards the opposite residential area, Richard said, "Follow her."

Nina walked back to her residential area, completely unaware that a car had been following her all along. Security guard David Garcia stopped the car at the entrance of the residential area, peering out from the guardhouse and asking, "What's your business here?" 

"Just visiting relatives." Michael rolled down the window, wearing a smile that still seemed suspicious.

"Which building and apartment number?" David looked cautious.

"I forgot."

"In that case, you can't come in."

"Damn, I'm giving you a face!" Michael cursed and seemed ready to get out and confront him.

Suddenly, Richard reached out and patted his shoulder. "Back the car out. I'll go in. You wait outside."

"But Brother Richard."

"Do I need to repeat myself?" Richard's tone shifted slightly.

"I dare not." Michael gritted his teeth, glared fiercely at David, and then backed the car out.

Nina had a leg injury, so she walked slowly. After entering the residential area, she relaxed and sat by a flower bed for a moment. A small dog ran over and nuzzled against her feet. Nina bent down, gently petting the dog.

Meanwhile, Richard stood not far away, quietly looking at Nina. He never expected to encounter Nina here, but she probably wouldn't recognize him.

After a short rest, Nina got up to continue home. She always felt like someone was following her, but whenever she turned around, there was nothing there.

Upon entering her home, Nina changed her shoes, and the doorbell rang. Looking through the peephole and seeing no one, she opened the door, and a bag hanging on the handle fell.

When she picked it up, Nina's spine chilled.

It was the medication the doctor had prescribed earlier.

However, she returned empty-handed, indicating that Richard, the man in question, must have delivered the medication. No wonder she had felt like someone was following her!

Thinking of Richard's face, Nina broke out in a cold sweat, forcefully closed the door, and felt weak in the legs. It seemed that by giving the wrong address on purpose, Richard had found out. But she didn't know if she had offended him or what trouble it might bring.

Alone at home, Nina was terrified and decided to call Charlie.

The phone rang for a long time before he answered. Amidst a noisy background, Charlie's impatient voice came through: "What's up?"

"Charlie, when are you coming back?"

"I'm having drinks with friends. You go ahead and sleep. No need to wait for me!" Charlie hung up before Nina could respond.

Listening to the busy tone, Nina felt extremely disappointed.

Isabella returned to the dorm to find the lights on. When she pushed the door open, she found Samantha inside. 
Samantha, in her pajamas, was sitting on the bed, drying her hair, looking like she had just come out of the shower. Her suitcase was by the bed, with clothes scattered around. It seemed like she had moved back in.

Isabella furrowed her brows, walked past her bed, picked up her pajamas, and headed to the bathroom. Unexpectedly, as she pushed the door open, she came face-to-face with Matthew, who was shirtless.

Isabella was startled.

Samantha walked over, linking arms with Matthew, and said, "Bella, you don't mind if I let my boyfriend stay in the dorm, right?"

Isabella widened her eyes. "Boys aren't allowed in the girls' dorm. Are you crazy?"

"Rules are dead, but people are alive. As long as you help us keep it a secret, the dorm supervisor won't find out," Samantha said. Isabella was speechless about them.

She knew Samantha had thick skin, but she didn't expect it to be so thick.

"I won't keep your secret," Isabella said with a frown. "The girls' dorm is off limits to boys.  If you want to live together, please find somewhere else to stay."

This was a dormitory. What do they think this place was?

Matthew remained silent.

His silence toward Samantha felt more like silent approval. Samantha scoffed, "Isabella, you've had men stay in the dorm before, so why act innocent?"
###chapter 65: You're Filthy
"Samantha, watch your mouth. When did I ever let a man stay in the dorm?" Isabella was a bit annoyed. She hated it when people tried to tarnish her reputation, especially Samantha.

"Did I say something wrong?" Samantha raised an eyebrow, getting more aggressive. "The entire building knew that you let a man stay in the dorm. What are you pretending now?"

Isabella understood. Samantha was referring to Sebastian. But that night, it was clearly Samantha's scheme to frame him. Otherwise, Sebastian wouldn't have brought Jack into the girls' dorm. Later, she had to lock Sebastian out of the dorm for the night because he had missed the curfew. 
Samantha didn't mention her own faults at all. She just kept blaming Isabella.

Isabella showed no interest in explaining the situation to them. She said coldly, "You have ten minutes to leave. If you don't, I'll go tell the dorm auntie!"

Matthew glanced at Isabella but remained silent. He walked to Samantha's bed and started getting dressed.

Upon seeing this, Samantha became disoriented. Feeling frustrated, she walked up to Isabella's desk. "Isabella, there are many boys staying overnight in the girls' dorm every night. As long as you report it, it won't just be me you offend. I suggest you think carefully!"

Isabella remained silent. Samantha was speaking the truth. Although there were rules against guys staying overnight in the dorm, many girls still secretly brought them in every night. She just wanted to drive away Matthew and Samantha for peace of mind, not really intending to report anyone. It wasn't worth offending everyone just for Samantha's sake!

Samantha deduced her intentions and approached Matthew after observing Isabella's silence, expressing in a flirtatious manner, "Matthew, please stay tonight."

Matthew paused, then gently touched Samantha's cheek and said, "I won't leave."

So Matthew stayed. Isabella read for a while, then took her pajamas and towel to the bathroom to freshen up. This time, she brought her keys just in case. Placing her phone and keys on the sink, she turned on the tap.

The sound of water in the bathroom clearly distracted Matthew. 
"Matthew." Samantha slithered into Matthew's arms like a snake, running her fingers in circles around his chest, trying to entice him.

When the water stopped, two minutes later, Isabella opened the bathroom door and walked out. Samantha's bed was right next to the bathroom, a place Isabella had to pass. As soon as she emerged, she saw the two entangled figures. Matthew was only wearing black shorts when he pressed down on Samantha. The scene was very impressive.

Isabella furrowed her brows, walked past without a glance, and drew the curtain after returning to her bed.

Seeing this, Matthew frowned deeply.

"Matthew," said Samantha, who was soft and pliant like the mud beneath him. 
But Matthew suddenly lost interest, reached over to grab her waist, and said, "I'm going to sleep."

He then turned over to the other side, facing away from Samantha.

Disappointed by his sudden change, Samantha was at a loss. This wasn't the first time Matthew had abruptly stopped like this. He hadn't engaged with her since the first time she initiated it. 
She had thought things would finally progress because of his recent enthusiasm, but it turned out otherwise!

Samantha's desires were now ignited. Stopping abruptly left her feeling hot and uncomfortable all over. She wriggled closer to Matthew, her hand slipping under the covers. "Matthew."

The next moment, Matthew caught Samantha's hand and squeezed it firmly. His tone lacked any desire, even carrying a hint of annoyance. "Are you sleeping or not?"

Samantha had to retract her hand.

As the commotion outside quieted down, Isabella picked up her phone, opened her status, and coincidentally saw a post by Vanessa from three minutes ago.

There was no caption, just two pictures. One was a candlelit dinner panorama, and the other showed two hands holding wine glasses.

After just three minutes of posting, there were already a large number of comments below. 
Laura, [I call dibs on being the maid of honor!]

Vanessa replied, [You're the chosen one.]

Colleague Amber, [Such an exquisite dinner, the epitome of romance. It looks like sister Vanessa is going to be happy.]

Colleague Little B, [I recognize those wine glasses. A set costs no less than a fortune. Looks like Sister Vanessa's boyfriend is a handsome and wealthy guy!]

Laura replied to Colleague Little B, [He is definitely a handsome and wealthy guy. Wait for the official announcement; it will surely blow your minds!]

Colleague Little B replied to Laura, [Sister Laura and Sister Vanessa are so close; you must know the inside story. Can you give us a hint?]

Colleague Little C, [I'm curious too. Please, Sister Laura, satisfy our curiosity a bit.]

Laura replied to Colleague Little C, [When the time is right, the announcement will be made. It's going to be a jaw-dropping event!]

Isabella silently read through all the comments, then closed her phone. Despite shutting her eyes, she couldn't fall asleep. She tossed and turned until the late hours of the night. Just as she was drifting off, she felt hands caressing her face. The ticklish sensation felt unreal. At first, she thought she was dreaming until a soft touch on her lips and a strange scent invaded her senses, causing her to abruptly open her eyes and see Matthew!

Isabella's brain paused for two seconds.

Matthew gazed at her. Seeing her awake, he didn't get up but instead gently rubbed her lips with his teeth, trying to part them.

Feeling nauseated, Isabella pushed Matthew away with both hands. As she sat up, she delivered a slap across Matthew's face.

The sound of the slap was particularly crisp and loud.

Matthew touched his cheek with his tongue, leaving a faint red mark on his fair face. When he turned to see Isabella wiping her mouth frantically with tissues, his expression darkened.

Matthew grabbed Isabella's wrist, halting her actions, and stared at her with deep, dark eyes. "Am I filthy?"

Once, even a touch from Isabella's hand would make her sweet for half a day. Now, after a kiss, she found him repulsive. It was a heart-wrenching realization.

Isabella shook off his hand and bluntly nodded, "Yes."

Matthew furrowed his brows.

Isabella added, "You're filthy!"

After a moment of silence, Matthew suddenly chuckled. "So, Isabella, are you not filthy?"

Isabella slapped him again, this time so hard that her palm stung. Matthew had no right to consider her filthy.

Matthew chuckled, his eyes fixed on Isabella. "Samantha told me all about what happened between you and Sebastian. You don't need to glare at me like that. I know Sebastian well. If you hadn't let him touch you, he wouldn't have treated you so special. But, Isabella, don't forget, Sebastian has a girlfriend. You were merely a passing fancy for him. But if you want to be a plaything, you can be mine. Whatever Sebastian gave you, I can give you, and even more."
###chapter 66: Jealousy Shouldn't Lead to Stealing
Isabella slapped Matthew's face, but his smile grew even more conceited. He turned around, grabbed Isabella's hands, and pushed her down onto the bed.

Isabella struggled hard, kicking him with her feet. "Matthew, you jerk!"

"Yes, I'm a jerk!" Matthew gritted his teeth. "Let me show you how much of a jerk I can be!"

With that, he leaned down to kiss her.

"What are you doing?" Samantha's scream came as she threw away the hot water bottle in her hand and rushed over to hit Matthew.

But as Matthew turned to look at her, Samantha's hand froze in mid-air.

Matthew then turned to Isabella. "Isabella, don't provoke Sebastian. He's not someone you can control!"

After saying that, he let go of her hand.

Isabella got up from the bed, raised her hand, and slapped him again.

Matthew furrowed his brows but didn't say anything.

Beside them, Samantha hesitated for a moment, then screamed and lunged at Isabella. "Isabella, you're crazy! How dare you hit my man?"

Samantha attempted to strike Isabella with her beautiful hands, but Matthew caught her hand before it could reach her.
"Matthew!" Samantha stared at him in disbelief, tears welling up in her eyes. Matthew was actually protecting Isabella!

Matthew pulled Samantha away from the dormitory to the car. It wasn't until they reached the car that Samantha shook off his hand and cried, "Matthew, what do you mean?"

Matthew looked impatiently at her.  "What do I mean?"

"What were you doing just now? You deliberately distracted me to be with Isabella. You got hit, and you still protect her!"

"Yes!"

Unexpectedly, he admitted it directly. Samantha was at a loss for words, choked up for a while, and asked in grievance, "Then what am I to you?"

Matthew lowered his head for a moment. "You know how you manipulated me in the beginning. I previously wanted to be responsible to you, but how do you explain Leo Anderson?"

"Leo Anderson." Samantha's eyes flickered, yet she maintained a firm tone. "I've said it before. I don't even know him. He was brought in by Isabella to slander me!"

"Do you believe the things you're saying?" Matthew remained surprisingly calm.

Although Matthew had learned about the situation between Samantha and Leo, he wasn't angry at all. Instead, he felt a sense of relief. He had always felt guilty for what he had done wrong, betraying both Isabella and Samantha. Now that he knew Samantha's true nature, the guilt he felt towards her vanished in an instant.

Samantha wanted to say something more, but Matthew took out a stack of photos from the car and threw them on the hood. "Take a look for yourself."

Samantha walked over and noticed surveillance photos of her and Leo entering and leaving a small hotel. Some photos date back three months!

Looking at these photos, Samantha was speechless for a moment.

Matthew looked at her and said, "Before you try to defend yourself, make sure your backside is clean. Samantha. You're quite something!"

With those words, Matthew gritted his teeth. If it weren't for Samantha's scheme, he and Isabella wouldn't have ended up like this today. He wondered if he still had a chance to reconcile and go back with Isabella.

Samantha shook her head. "The situation with Leo Anderson is now in the past. After being with you, I cut ties with him. Matthew, believe me, I genuinely like you. Every day, I see how good you are to Isabella, and how your eyes are solely on her. I can't help but feel so jealous of her."

"Jealousy shouldn't lead to stealing someone else's things!" Matthew interrupted her. Now that he knew Samantha's true face, even a second glance at her made him uncomfortable.

Samantha reached out and grabbed his sleeve, tears streaming down her face. "Matthew, I know I was wrong. Can you forgive me this time? I kept Leo Anderson's matter from you because I was afraid you would despise and reject me. I truly love you. That's why I did it."

Samantha cried, almost kneeling down to beg Matthew. As long as she could keep Matthew, she was willing to do anything. 
Matthew looked at her quietly for a moment and said, "I'll give you a chance to make amends."

"Make amends?"

"I've ended up in this situation with Isabella because of you. As long as you help me win back Isabella, I'll pay you money as a gesture of apology and reward. Finally, we settle the matter." Matthew's words were calm, as if he were discussing a good business deal with Samantha.

Samantha momentarily lost her composure. "You want to win back Isabella Miller?"

"Yes," Matthew replied directly. "I can't let go of Isabella Miller. If it weren't for you, she and I wouldn't have broken up!"

Samantha shook her head and spoke. "So, you found out about Leo Anderson's matter but didn't rush to expose me. You deliberately stayed with me last night. Everything you're doing is trying to win back Isabella Miller. You're using me to get close to Isabella Miller?"

"Yes."

"No!" Samantha shook her head. "I don't believe it!"

"Whether you believe it or not doesn't matter. I'm giving you a chance."

"I don't want it!" Samantha let out a scream. "I don't want us to break up. I don't want you to go back to Isabella Miller. Matthew, I know you're angry, but I disagree with breaking up. I disagree!"

Matthew gave her one last look and then drove away.

Watching the car get farther and farther away, Samantha clenched her lips. She wouldn't let Isabella take Matthew away!

When Sebastian came downstairs from the building, Vanessa was preparing breakfast.

Seeing him, Vanessa smiled. "Good morning."

Thinking about last night, Sebastian hesitated for a moment. "I'm sorry, last night..."

"You don't need to apologize to me," Vanessa interrupted Sebastian. "I know I'm not good enough, but time will tell. I believe that one day Mr. Landon will genuinely accept me."

Vanessa had carefully arranged everything last night, but Sebastian still didn't touch her.

She didn't know where the problem lay. The atmosphere was right, the mood was set, and she even took a bath and put on seductive lingerie, but Sebastian still rejected her.

Vanessa didn't sleep well all night, thinking about where things went wrong. She also understood that she was replacing Isabella now. If she wanted Sebastian to regain the feeling of that night and willingly touch her, maybe she should focus more on Isabella to find a breakthrough.

After breakfast, as she watched Sebastian's car leave, Vanessa took out her phone and called Samantha.

At that moment, Samantha was going crazy in the dormitory. When her phone rang, she thought it was Matthew calling. Seeing Vanessa's name, Samantha became even more furious. She answered the phone, saying, "Ms. Field, what do you want?"

Vanessa paused for a moment and then said in a calm tone, "Samantha, I'm sorry. I told you a joke that got you ejected. Where are you now? I'll come see you and apologize in person."

Samantha sneered, "Fine, I'm in the dormitory. I also want to ask you in person. Why did you do this?"
###chapter 67 This Is Somewhat Ironic
Half an hour later, Vanessa arrived at the women's dormitory.

Samantha opened the door without being polite to her, and went straight to the point: "I am no longer with the Landon Group now, and I have no more utility value. I wonder why Ms. Field has come. Is there anything going on?"

In a sense, Samantha felt that Vanessa was similar to her, both belonging to the type of people who would shirk responsibility when something went wrong and let others take the blame. She didn't foolishly think that Vanessa had come to apologize sincerely.

Vanessa walked in, closed the door, first looked around this small dorm room, and then smiled. "Although your dorm is small, it is clean and cozy."

Samantha frowned. "Let's get to the point. I'm not in the mood to argue with you at this moment!"

Samantha was previously polite to Vanessa because she was an employee of the Landon Group. Now, she no longer cared about Vanessa's feelings after her expulsion. 

Vanessa walked over and handed her the bag. "I really came to compensate you, sincerely. I didn't expect that a joke I told would lead to your termination.  I feel really uneasy about it. Fortunately, nothing happened to Isabella that night. If something serious had happened, I wouldn't know how to face you."

Samantha glanced at the bag, and her expression softened. "What's this?"

"For the latest season's M.C., I asked a friend to buy it for me. Now I'm giving it to you as compensation." Vanessa smiled generously.

"For me?" Samantha reached out and took it. Inside the bag was an exquisite gift box containing a makeup set. "This must cost over two thousand dollars."

"Over three thousand." Vanessa flicked her hair and said, "It's worth it when given to a friend."

"A friend?" Samantha, taken aback, accepted the gift box. Immediately, Samantha's anger transformed into a smile. She even took Vanessa's hand and said, "Yes, we are friends. Sister Vanessa, I had a quarrel with my boyfriend just now, and I'm not in a good mood. I was a bit harsh in my words. Please don't mind."

Vanessa smiled. "Of course not. A true friend wouldn't be mad at you."

"Can I open it and take a look?" Samantha was a bit impatient, her hand constantly caressing the gift box and her eyes sparkling.

Samantha had never used such high-quality items before. The best skincare products Matthew had given her were only worth a few thousand dollars. This gift was like a priceless treasure to Samantha.

"Of course, it's for you. Feel free to look and it and use it." Vanessa said this while sitting down beside Samantha.

Samantha opened the gift box, took out each item to examine and smell, and carefully put them back in. She was overjoyed.

Vanessa's gaze fell on the bed near the balcony, and she casually asked, "Does anyone else live in your dorm?"

Samantha didn't look up. "That's Isabella's bed."

" Does Isabella live here too?"

"Yes." Samantha replied casually, then took out the perfume, sprayed a bit on her wrist, and sniffed it. "It's my favorite rose scent. Sister Vanessa, I really love this gift you gave me."

After losing a job and receiving such a generous gift in return, Samantha felt like she had gained something.

"It's good that you like it." Vanessa smiled, her gaze shifting to the bathroom door. "Samantha, can I use your bathroom?"

"Of course, feel free to use it." Samantha was completely immersed herself in joy, agreeing to everything Vanessa asked.

Seeing Vanessa enter the bathroom, Samantha quickly took out her phone, checked the authenticity of the makeup set, and also looked up the price on the official website.

Indeed, it was over three thousand dollars!

Even if she sold this set, it could fetch at least two thousand dollars at a low price.

Samantha was so happy that she couldn't stop smiling. She immediately took photos, edited them, added filters, and posted them on all her social media accounts.

When entering the bathroom, Vanessa took photos of all the skincare and bath products inside. After searching online, Vanessa was a bit skeptical. "Such cheap bath and body products?"

Even with expensive perfumes costing thousands of dollars, she still couldn't attract Sebastian. But Isabella managed to win Sebastian over with these cheap goods.

This is somewhat ironic!

However, Vanessa doesn't mind these things. As long as she could win Sebastian over, she would imitate him, even if it meant rolling in the mud. After taking photos, Vanessa sat for a while before bidding farewell.

Instead of going home, she went straight to the supermarket and bought the same bath and body products as Isabella.

The Landon Group.

As soon as Isabella arrived at the Landon Group, Kelsey dragged her to the water cooler.

Kelsey wrote a line on a check, tore it off, and handed it to Isabella, "Here."

Isabella looked down and saw a full twenty thousand dollars!

"Ms. Jose."

Impatiently, Kelsey stuffed the check into her hand and said, "Twenty thousand dollars. You're swapping desks with me."

Isabella was speechless.

What was Kelsey up to?

Regardless of whether Isabella agreed or not, Kelsey turned and walked out of the water cooler.

Isabella watched her enter the CEO's office, thought for a moment, then walked back to her original seat.

Not long after, Sebastian arrived.

Laura whispered, "Mr. Landon looks so energetic. He must have had a great time last night."

"What did Mr. Landon eat?" Colleague Amber looked curious and puzzled.

Laura smiled mysteriously and didn't explain. When she turned around, she saw Isabella and said sarcastically, "Did Mr. Landon kick you out?"

Isabella continued working seriously, but Laura's words, 'Mr. Landon ate well,' kept echoing in her mind. She remembered the status Vanessa posted last night, and she guessed that Vanessa and Sebastian must have had a pleasant night.

And the things Matthew said in the morning kept replaying in Isabella's mind.

Reflecting on this period, Sebastian had been particularly attentive to her. Could it be true, as Matthew said, that Sebastian just wanted to play Isabella? If that was the case, she needed to keep her distance from Sebastian!

Thinking of Sebastian led Isabella to think of Matthew. The thought of Matthew brought back memories of the morning when someone had forcibly kissed her. Even though she had brushed her teeth many times and even made her gums bleed, she still felt unclean in her mouth. Isabella opened her water bottle to take a sip, but her stomach acid surged, so she ended up spitting it out.

Sebastian walked into the office and placed breakfast on Isabella's desk. "I brought you breakfast."

"Thank you, Brother Sebastian," the sweet voice of a girl sounded.

Sebastian paused and turned to see Kelsey's face.

"Why are you here?"

"I swapped positions with Isabella for twenty thousand dollars. From now on, I'll be working with you."

###chapter 68: Threw Up
"Why is that milk?" Kelsey opened the bag and looked inside. Her face was full of disgust. "Brother Sebastian, I hate drinking milk the most!"

Sebastian walked back, reached out, and took the breakfast away. "If you don't like it, don't drink it. Don't force yourself."

Seeing her breakfast taken away, Kelsey frowned unhappily. "Brother Sebastian, is this for Isabella?"

Sebastian didn't answer Kelsey's question. He placed the breakfast on the desk and went to hang up his coat.

"They all say you treat Isabella differently. I didn't believe it at first, but now I do." Kelsey propped her chin up, staring intently at Sebastian's face. "Brother Sebastian, do you really have feelings for Isabella?"

"The workplace's first rule is not to discuss anything other than working with the boss unless the boss brings it up first!" Sebastian warned Kelsey before pressing the intercom.

Laura answered the call, "Mr. Landon."

"Ask Isabella to come in."

"Mr. Landon, Isabella is not at her desk."

Sebastian paused. "Where did she go?"

"I don't know. She was here a moment ago, maybe she went somewhere to slack off."

"When she returns, have her come into the office."

"Alright, Mr. Landon." Laura hung up, and Isabella returned.

"Isabella..." Laura instinctively called out to her.

Isabella stopped and asked, "What's up?"

Laura hesitated, then smiled and said, "Nothing."

She then returned to work. 
She didn't relay Sebastian's words, so Isabella was waiting to be scolded!

After sitting down for a while, Isabella felt her stomach churning again. She took a few sips of hot water to calm it down a bit. But her stomach still felt uneasy.

Just a while ago, Isabella had been in the bathroom throwing up for five minutes, managing to get rid of her breakfast and milk she had eaten earlier. However, she didn't feel any better. Her stomach continued to feel uncomfortable, as if she had eaten something wrong.

Sebastian walked out of the office. "Isabella."

"Mr. Landon." Isabella immediately stood up, thinking he was going to talk about switching seats with Kelsey. She said, "I'm fine sitting here."

Sebastian smirked, his gaze deep and gentle on Isabella's face. "I didn't ask about the seating. Have you had breakfast?"

Isabella nodded. "Yes."

But she threw up again, and now her stomach felt empty and uncomfortable.

"You don't look well." Sebastian looked at Isabella's face. "Feeling unwell?"

"Maybe the breakfast upset my stomach."

"Dr. Finn will be coming over soon. Let him check on you. If there's anything wrong, you can tell me."

Isabella looked up and met Sebastian's calm and gentle eyes. His gaze was always deep and inscrutable. After just two seconds of eye contact, she looked away.

Sebastian knew Isabella had misunderstood, afraid that others would misunderstand her too. So he said, "I'm the boss. If you're not feeling well, tell me, and I'll give you a day off."

That was what he meant.

Isabella felt a bit embarrassed. She had misunderstood and overthought things.

Laura, watching from the side, was angry. She thought Isabella would be scolded, but it didn't happen!

Back in the office, Jack was waiting to report tasks to Sebastian. Kelsey was idle, studying cups and plates at the water cooler.

"Mr. Landon..." Jack started, but Sebastian interrupted.

"Call Marvin Finn over."

"Dr. Finn?" Jack was puzzled. "Mr. Landon, are you feeling unwell?"

"A little."

Jack called Marvin, and upon hearing that Sebastian wasn't feeling well, Marvin quickly grabbed his medical kit and rushed out the door. As he started the car, Marvin asked, "Where are you feeling unwell, Mr. Landon?"

Jack glanced at Sebastian, who was sitting in his office chair, handling business. "Not quite sure."

As far as Jack could tell, Sebastian seemed fine.

After Marvin arrived and examined Sebastian, he found nothing wrong.

"Mr. Landon, where exactly are you feeling unwell?" Marvin asked, puzzled.

"I felt a bit dizzy earlier, but I'm much better now. I probably didn't get enough rest." Sebastian said this, rubbing his temples.

At that moment, Isabella walked in. "Mr. Landon, did you call for me?"

"Dr. Finn is here. If you're not feeling well, let him check on you."

Marvin was speechless.

He seemed to suddenly understand something.

Marvin asked Isabella to sit on the couch and inquired, "Where are you feeling unwell?"

"I feel nauseous," Isabella said. "Probably ate something bad."

"Did you throw up?"

"Yes."

"Any other symptoms besides vomiting?" Marvin asked seriously.

Isabella thought for a moment and shook her head. "No."

Marvin furrowed his brow. "Did you suddenly vomit? Do you have any previous history of similar illnesses? Have you taken any medication recently?"

Isabella shook her head. "It was sudden, and I haven't taken any medication. I've never vomited when I was sick before. So I suspect I ate something wrong."

Marvin stared at Isabella's face for a moment, then said, "Give me your left hand."

Isabella extended her hand, placing it on the armrest of the couch. As soon as Marvin checked her pulse, his expression changed suddenly.

"Dr. Finn, am I okay?"

Isabella had asked the question, but Marvin glanced at Sebastian. That glance carried a lot of meaning.

Sebastian understood his implication and said to Jack and Kelsey, "You two, step out."

Kelsey looked at Isabella strangely. "Why do we have to leave? Is Isabella really ill?"

Marvin coughed. "It's not a serious illness, it's her privacy. I think it's best for you to leave."

Kelsey didn't understand. " I know it's her privacy. But then Brother Sebastian should leave with us too!"

Sebastian calmly said, "As the boss, I have the right to care about the physical and mental health of every employee."

At first listen, Sebastian's reason sounded reasonable, but it was actually quite absurd.

Kelsey didn't see anything wrong and could only follow Jack out.

Once the door closed, Sebastian asked, "Tell me, what's wrong with her?"

At this moment, Sebastian's expression also became serious because he knew Marvin was not one to exaggerate. If he asked Jack and Kelsey to leave, it meant Isabella was really in trouble!

Isabella also became nervous, with her gaze locked on Marvin.

Marvin looked at Sebastian, then at Isabella. "It's nothing major, and she's pregnant."

"That's good."

"Pregnant!"
###chapter 69: Pregnant
The office was filled with such silence that it was impossible to hear anything. 

Isabella widened her eyes. "Dr. Finn, what did you say?"

"Based on your pulse, it appears you're pregnant!" 

"Impossible!" Isabella blurted out.

Marvin sensed something amiss. "Why impossible?"

"Because I..." Isabella's words trailed off abruptly because she had taken emergency contraception. It hadn't been 72 hours yet, so it should have been effective. She couldn't be pregnant.

Marvin glanced at Sebastian meaningfully and said, "Even with precautions, it's still possible to get pregnant. Precautions are not completely safe."

"Then taking the pill isn't one hundred percent either?" Isabella's voice started to tremble. It was precisely because of this fear that she took the pill, but she never thought she would still end up pregnant!

Marvin looked at Sebastian again and said, "Normally, taking the pill should prevent pregnancy. What brand of pill did you take?"

Isabella shook her head.

She just randomly took one of Nina's pills without paying attention to the brand.

"Does the brand matter?"

"It helps to some extent, but it's not crucial. Generally, if it's a generic pill, there's a possibility that the effectiveness isn't as strong. Another possibility is that the pill has expired." Marvin's gaze shifted between Sebastian and Isabella. "If you still have the pill, I can take a look at it."

Isabella shook her head again. She already felt uncomfortable in her stomach. Her face was now even paler. "Dr. Finn, are you sure?"

"I can't be completely certain just by feeling your pulse. If you're worried, you can buy a pregnancy test stick or go to the hospital for a blood test." Marvin didn't want to make any definitive statements.

"Okay." Isabella nodded, then turned to Sebastian and said, "Mr. Landon, I'd like to take a leave."

"Do you need me to accompany you?" Sebastian asked.

Isabella shook her head and walked away.

As she left, Marvin couldn't hold back: "Mr. Landon, aren't you going with her?"

Sebastian, with an impassive look in his eyes, said, "You heard her. She doesn't need me."

"This is a big deal." Marvin hesitated, then said, "Mr. Landon, even if you don't take precautions, you shouldn't rely on pills all the time. Taking pills is harmful to her body."

Sebastian was taken aback, then chuckled. "You think it's mine?"

"Isn't it?"

Sebastian waved his hand, unwilling to explain further. "You can go."

Marvin was speechless.

Isabella went straight to the hospital because she was afraid that the pregnancy test stick might be inaccurate, so she opted for a blood test, which would provide a reliable result.

She had her blood drawn and had to wait for fifteen minutes.

During those fifteen minutes, Isabella sat on a chair, her mind in a whirl.

She was actually pregnant!

Pregnant with Sebastian's child!

The fifteen minutes passed quickly, and Isabella received the report. She didn't dare look at it and handed it directly to the doctor.

The doctor glanced at it and said, "You're pregnant."

Isabella felt her head spin for a moment. Even though she had been prepared, she still found it hard to believe. "Doctor, are you sure?"

"Of course, I'm sure. Your HCG levels are high. When was your last menstrual period?" The doctor looked at Isabella and understood instantly. "You don't intend to keep it?"

Isabella was still reeling from the previous question when she faced this one. 
To keep or not to keep.

Isabella hadn't even thought about this question!

The doctor handed the report to Isabella and said softly, "Maybe you should go back and discuss it with the child's father. If you decide to keep it, make sure to supplement your nutrition promptly and have regular check-ups. If you decide not to keep it, come to the hospital as soon as possible for the procedure. The mother's body can sustain more damage the longer the pregnancy continues." 

Isabella took the report and said, "Thank you, doctor."

Isabella walked out of the hospital in a daze and took a taxi to Nina's house. She was preoccupied and didn't even notice Matthew following her.

Seeing her arrive, Nina was both surprised and happy. She washed some fruit for Isabella.

Isabella sniffed and noticed that the smell of Chinese medicine in the room was stronger than last time. "Sis, are you still taking Chinese medicine?"

"Yes, my mother-in-law said I have to take it for at least a month before we can try to conceive, which can increase the chances."

In Nina's eyes, Isabella saw desire. "Sis, do you like children?"

"I do." Nina answered without hesitation and with mixed emotions. "Maybe it's because I'm getting older. I used to find children noisy and troublesome, but since we started trying to conceive, I've found myself liking kids more and more. I'm hoping these medicines will work and help me have a child."

Isabella fell into thought. She actually liked children too, and if she could, she would want to keep this child.

"Bella?" Nina shook her hand, "What's wrong with you? You look distracted. Is something wrong?"

"Nothing." Isabella smiled and shook her head, changing the subject. "Sis, I remember you used to take birth control pills."

"Yes, I did. I didn't want children back then. I wanted to earn money. But it's been a long time since I took those pills. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over a year now, but those pills have long expired. I wouldn't have remembered if you hadn't mentioned it. I'll throw them all away later."

Isabella was speechless.

Indeed, the birth control pills had expired.

"I wonder if it's because I took too many pills in the past. Now that I want to, I can't get pregnant." Nina patted Isabella's hand, "You don't know, when I went to the hospital for a check-up, I met many who couldn't conceive. Some had congenital issues, but most were young and just didn't take care of their bodies, either by taking too many pills or having too many abortions, which now makes it difficult for them to conceive. It's really pitiful."

"Can abortions also lead to infertility?" Isabella was surprised to hear this from Nina, as she had no knowledge in this area.

"Of course. Abortions cause significant trauma to a woman's body."

Passing by a pharmacy, Isabella hesitated for a moment before going in to buy folic acid tablets.

Back in the dorm, Isabella poured a glass of water, intending to take a folic acid tablet, when a hand reached out from the side, accurately grabbing her wrist.

Isabella turned in surprise. "Matthew?"

With a cold expression, Matthew took the folic acid tablet from her hand and threw it directly into the trash. "This child cannot stay!"

Isabella was shocked. "How did you know?"

"I saw you at the hospital." Matthew held her shoulders and said, "Isabella, abort this child. I'll go with you!"
###chapter 70: Don't Let Him Know
Isabella was stunned for a moment before she reacted and broke free from Matthew's grasp. "Why?" she asked.

"Because this child will ruin you!" Matthew gritted his teeth. "If Sebastian finds out, he will never allow you to stay!"

"I won't let him know!" Isabella declared. "This child is in my belly, and he is mine. Besides me, no one can decide his fate!"

"Are you crazy?" Matthew looked at her in confusion. "Do you have feelings for Seb?"

Isabella hesitated, unconsciously tightening her grip on the cup.

Spending time with Sebastian gave her the impression that he was kind, gentle, and approachable. He treated her well, but Isabella also knew her boundaries. Sebastian was Vanessa's fiancÃ©, and she couldn't interfere in someone else's relationship.

Suddenly, Matthew embraced Isabella from behind. "Bella, get rid of this child. If you want a child, I'll give you one. I've broken up with Samantha. It was her plan. We can reconcile and go back to how we used to be. I will continue to treat you well."

Isabella felt her stomach churning intensely, pushed him away, and rushed to the bathroom.

Matthew followed, patting her back and handing her a towel.

With red eyes, Isabella glanced at him. "Matthew, do you think we can go back to how we were before?"

"We can!" Matthew took a step forward, holding her hand. "As long as you agree, we can go back to how we were."

"But both of us are no longer clean!" Isabella closed her eyes and withdrew her hand. "I hope you can help me keep the child a secret. Even if you don't keep it, it's okay. I won't force you."

"Bella!"

Isabella opened the door to the dorm room without looking at him. "Please leave!"

Deep furrows appeared on Matthew's forehead. He eventually left the dorm room.

Isabella closed the door, feeling weak in the knees. She wasn't sure if Matthew would reveal the secret, but she was too distraught to think about it now.

As the day's work ended, Sebastian returned home when night had fallen.

He sat in the car for a moment, took out his phone, opened Isabella's WhatsApp, looked at her profile picture, and then exited. He wanted to ask her how she was doing, but felt it was too forward.

At this moment, the child's father should be with her.

Ultimately, Sebastian exited the WhatsApp interface, put on his coat, and entered the house.

Zoe was still in the hospital, making the house unusually quiet. Vanessa was probably already asleep, with only the warm wall lamp illuminating the room.

Sebastian went upstairs, took a shower, and then noticed a lump in the bedding, as if someone were there. He furrowed his brows and walked over, lifting the covers, only to find Vanessa curled up in his bed.

Tonight, Vanessa wore a silk camisole nightgown, the hem of which barely covered her thighs.  In addition to her seductive sleeping posture, she still had a captivating allure. 

"Mr. Landon, you're back." Vanessa opened her eyes, lazily stretching her body, revealing an enticing neckline. As Vanessa moved, the hem of her dress shifted upward, creating a tantalizing effect.

Sebastian, seeing this scene, only furrowed his brows. "What are you doing here?"

Vanessa, taken aback, propped herself up on her arms.  "I was waiting for you to come back, but I fell asleep."

She stood up, arms outstretched towards Sebastian. "Mr. Landon, are you interested tonight?"

A familiar faint fragrance wafted around, and Sebastian caught Vanessa's wrist and looked at her. "What's that scent on you?"

Vanessa looked innocent. "I just changed my body wash. Do you like it?"

Sebastian sniffed the scent, and Isabella's face flashed in his mind. "It's nice."

Vanessa leaned in, her fingers brushing his cheek. "So, Mr. Landon, are you up for it?"

As Sebastian smelled the fragrance and thought of Isabella, he felt a slight reaction.

Vanessa noticed him, was secretly pleased, and leaned in to kiss his lips. But the next moment, Sebastian pushed her away.

"Bring me your body wash."

Seeing her hesitation, Sebastian dropped his coat. "I'll check it myself."

"Mr. Landon."

But Sebastian had already left the room, heading towards the bathroom.

As Vanessa followed, Sebastian entered the bathroom, holding the bottle of body wash with deep eyes...

"Mr. Landon."

Sebastian turned to stare at her. "Why did you suddenly start using this?"

Vanessa bit her lip. "Isabella recommended it to me. She said it's nice, so I bought it to try."

She knew Sebastian had stayed in Isabella's dorm before and probably saw these things. She was unable to hide it, so she brought up Isabella.

Sure enough, when Sebastian heard this, all doubts vanished from his eyes. But he still stared at the bottle of body wash, exuding a displeased aura.

Vanessa cautiously spoke up, "It's actually quite cheap. If you don't like it, I won't use it again."

After a moment of silence, Sebastian put down the body wash. "It's fine."

He then left Vanessa's bedroom. 
Seeing another failure, Vanessa gritted her teeth in frustration. She picked up the bottle of body wash, her mind racing. Sebastian had a reaction earlier, but he still didn't touch her, indicating that this thing was effective. Smelling it caused a reaction, but he still refused to touch her.

Because she wasn't Isabella, the answer was clear! 
Sebastian's physical response was only for Isabella!

No matter what she did, it was all in vain.

Frustrated, Vanessa wanted to talk to someone and called Laura.

After chatting for a while, Vanessa deliberately steered the conversation towards Isabella.

"Isabella didn't come to work today. It seems she took a sick day."

"Sick? What's wrong with Isabella?" Vanessa asked cautiously.

Laura, aware of Vanessa's animosity towards Isabella, didn't hide anything. " I don't know the specifics, but Dr. Finn asked Jack and Kelsey to leave when he treated her. Besides Dr. Finn, only Isabella and Mr. Landon were in the office. After a while, Isabella hurried out and left. Kelsey said it seemed like she ate something wrong and vomited a lot."

Vanessa was shocked. A very bad premonition was surging in her heart. "What did you say? Isabella vomited?"

"Yes, that's what I heard from Kelsey. 
However, based on Isabella's appearance, it didn't appear that she had eaten anything wrong, but rather that more terrible things had happened. Those who were unaware might mistakenly believe that Isabella was suffering from a terminal illness."

Laura continued talking, but Vanessa didn't hear a word, quickly saying before hanging up the phone, "It's late, Laura. You should rest early. Good night." 

The room fell silent, and Vanessa's mind was in turmoil.

After a moment, she calmed down and called Samantha.
###chapter 71 Isabella, She's So Sad.
Sebastian took a cold shower, and the desire slowly subsided. But as he lay on the bed, a faint floral scent seemed to linger in his nose, and Isabella's face involuntarily appeared in his mind.

Isabella was beautiful, with a full forehead and delicate features. And her cheek was only the size of a palm. Despite her 5 feet 9 inch height, she was so thin that it seemed like he could crush her with just one hand.

The next morning, Sebastian suddenly opened his eyes, sat up, and uncovered the blanket. As expected, the bed was wet again!

Sebastian furrowed his brow as he stared at the wet spot. He had never felt desire like this before. Vanessa, with whom he had spent a night, couldn't give him desire like that. But the innocent Isabella had given him that.

The feeling in the dream had been so real. It was as if he had really been with Isabella.

Early in the morning, Isabella was sick again.

When she came out of the bathroom, Samantha was sitting on the bed. Her gaze was fixed on her.

Isabella frowned, passed Samantha's bed, and returned to her own small bed. Drawing the curtain, she took out the bottle of folic acid from her bag, hesitated for a moment, and then popped a pill into her mouth.

Before she could think clearly, she had to take responsibility for the child's health.

As she walked downstairs and looked up, she saw Samantha standing on the balcony, staring at her intently.

Isabella furrowed her brow, quickened her pace, and walked away.

When Isabella's figure disappeared, Samantha turned back to the dormitory and started rummaging through Isabella's bed.

Anxiety surged in Isabella's heart. She opened her bag and glanced at the folic acid tablets. She was wary of Samantha and had guessed that Samantha would search through her things while she was away, so she took the folic acid tablets with her.

Samantha found nothing, which made her somewhat annoyed. Later, Vanessa called and asked about her progress.

Samantha frowned and said, "I didn't find anything. But I feel like Isabella is acting a little strange. Vanessa, do you know anything?"

Vanessa paused and said, "Isabella might be pregnant."

"What?" Samantha immediately thought of something, "No wonder she was so sick in the bathroom in the morning. whose child is she carrying?"

"I don't know," Vanessa said. "I heard it from Laura."

Samantha wasn't naive and quickly guessed, "Could Isabella's child be Mr. Landon's?"

"No!" Vanessa quickly refuted it without thinking.

But the quicker her response, the more suspicious it seemed.

Samantha understood it too well. She said, "Vanessa, rest assured, I won't let Isabella off easily, no matter whose child she's carrying."

After hanging up the phone, Samantha was excited and immediately opened several groups, anonymously spreading the news.

Pregnancy left Isabella feeling drained. She ran to the bathroom several times that morning, unable to stop vomiting.

As lunchtime approached, Isabella lay on her seat to rest. Laura walked over with a stack of documents, "Isabella, organize this. we'll need them in the afternoon."

Gritting her teeth, Isabella said, "Laura, I'm not feeling well today, can I..."

"No!" Laura interrupted her impatiently. "Mr. Landon may indulge you, but we won't. We're all here to work, so stop pretending to be weak."

Laura had been targeting her for more than a day. Isabella knew it was useless to argue with her. Laura was the team leader, and Isabella couldn't refute her on work matters. She had to sit up, although she was feeling dizzy, to deal with the dense text.

"Laura, you're good at making Isabella compromise and comply!"

"That's true. But I wonder if she'll complain to Mr. Landon?"

"What's there to fear?" Laura scoffed. "I'm not afraid, even if she tells Mr. Landon about this!"

A water cup flew toward Laura suddenly.

The cup narrowly missed Laura, but it almost hit her. Laura was startled and screamed.

Kelsey walked over slowly and picked up the cup from the ground, saying, "Sorry, my hand slipped."

Laura stared at her, "What? You clearly did it on purpose!"

Kelsey didn't argue and provocatively said, "If you say so, then I guess it was on purpose."

"You!" Laura wanted to rush up and hit her, but a few colleagues pulled her away.

Kelsey then walked to Isabella's desk and quietly watched her for a while. She finally couldn't bear it and took the documents from her hands. "You're so naive, can't you see that Laura is deliberately making things difficult for you?"

"I know."

Kelsey was surprised, "You know but you still endure it. Are you a masochist?"

Isabella pursed her lips, "You don't understand."

"What do you mean?" Kelsey insisted. "You're a grown adult. Why do you let yourself be bullied for nothing?"

Isabella fell silent for a moment and said, "Have you ever been bullied?"

Kelsey shook her head. "No."

"I have.

"I don't have parents and my only relative is my sister, who raised me. When I was young, I was often bullied."

Kelsey was touched, saying, "If someone bullies you, you should fight back. As long as you fight back, they won't dare to bully you again!"

"I fought back. But every time I did, the teacher would call my parents. My sister would be denounced by other parents. And the teacher would have opinions about me too. Ms. Jose, not every part of this world is fair, and there are places where the light can't reach. Even if you fight back, if you don't have someone strong behind you, you will suffer a lot." Isabella finished, took the documents, and said, "The company is the same way. Laura is the team leader. I need to complete the work she assigns me, as long as it doesn't involve personal safety and privacy."

Kelsey was silent for a while.

When Isabella looked up at Kelsey again, she saw that Kelsey was crying.

Isabella was taken aback and was about to ask Kelsey what was wrong when the office door opened, and Jack and Sebastian walked out.

Jack and Sebastian seemed like they were leaving, but after a few steps, they heard Kelsey crying. They both stopped and looked over.

"What's going on?"

"Isabella, Isabella, she...!" Kelsey choked up.

Jack looked at Isabella in surprise. "Isabella, did you hit Ms. Jose?"

Isabella was speechless.

Sebastian frowned slightly at Jack's response. How could a pregnant woman like Isabella hit Kelsey? It was more likely that Isabella was the one who had gotten hit by Kelsey.

Before Isabella could explain, Kelsey said, "I feel so sorry for Isabella."

Isabella felt a bit embarrassed and handed Kelsey a tissue. "Ms. Jose, please don't cry."
###chapter 72 I'll Raise You and the Kid
In the employee cafeteria.

Jack went to get food, Sebastian handed a tissue to Kelsey. "Tell me, what's wrong with Isabella?"

Kelsey wiped her tears and said, "Isabella said, there are places in this world where the light can't shine. Without someone behind you, even fighting back will make a person suffer a lot. Sebastian, I really feel sorry for her!"

Sebastian frowned, feeling inexplicably distressed. "What else did she say?"

"She said she has no parents, only a sister. She was always bullied when she was young." Kelsey was touched. "She said it so calmly, but I just feel so moved. I have parents who love me, and a brother who always spoils me. Even if I wanted the moon in the sky, my brother would find a way to get it for me. I often act spoiled and temperamental. I really shouldn't. Compared to Isabella, I'm living in paradise."

Sebastian smirked, looking somewhat relieved. "It's great that you think that."

"Oh, right." Kelsey took out a check from her pocket, "Sebastian, I lied to you before. Actually, Isabella didn't ask me for the twenty thousand dollars. She didn't ask me for anything and just agreed to switch seats with me. She's a kind girl. I'm willing to lose to her."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow, "What?"

"Yes." Kelsey took a sip of soup, her emotions stabilizing, "Sebastian, don't deny it. Although I've only been at the company for a few days, I've seen how good you are to Isabella. You like Isabella. Now that she's pregnant, you have to take responsibility for her!"

Sebastian was stunned for a moment, not knowing how to respond.

"Sebastian, you're like my brother. You're both emotionally clueless. When you like someone, you don't even realize it. My brother was like that too, so he missed out on Susan Anderson. If you like Isabella, speak up quickly. Don't wait for her to be taken away by someone else, or you'll end up like my brother."

"If your brother hears you say that, he'll probably cry again." Sebastian was amused by Kelsey's words. But he began to seriously consider this issue.

'Am I in love with Isabella? What do I really feel for Isabella?' Sebastian thought.

Jack walked over, carrying a packaged meal in his hand. "Mr. Landon, here's your meal. It's all light and appetizing dishes as you requested."

Sebastian stood up to take the meal. "You guys go ahead and eat."

Then he left the cafeteria.

Isabella's phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID. It was Matthew.

She didn't answer but just hung up.

Matthew called again.

Isabella still didn't answer. After hanging up, she blocked Matthew's number.

After a few seconds of silence, the office phone on the table rang, she reached out to pick it up. She heard the voice of the front desk staff. "Isabella, someone from the President's Office is looking for you."

"Okay, I'll be right down."

The Landon Group had strict access control, and you can't enter without swiping a card. Nina had come to see Isabella before, so Isabella thought it was Nina again. But when she went downstairs, she found that it was Matthew.

Matthew stood there in casual clothes, looking handsome in the sunlight. When he saw Isabella, he smiled gently, full of tenderness.

Isabella walked up to him, furrowing her brows. "Why are you here?"

"I brought you food." Matthew raised his hand, holding a lunch box and looking at her. "You don't look good, were you so upset that you didn't eat?"

Isabella didn't understand what he was saying and didn't want to be gossiped about. She just coldly said, "I've eaten, you can leave. Don't come to see me again."

She finished speaking and tried to leave, but Matthew held her back.

"What are you doing?" Isabella tried to pull her hand back, but he held it tighter, making it difficult for her to break free. She became the focus of the lobby.

Laura and a few girls were coming back from outside after eating, and they saw the scene as soon as they entered.

"Isn't that Isabella?"

"Who's that guy? He's quite handsome."

"Could he be her boyfriend?"

Laura immediately took out her phone and opened the camera.

Isabella looked around, feeling embarrassed, and whispered, "Matthew, let go of me. We're at the company, so it's not good for you to hold me like this in public!"

Matthew didn't let go. He looked at her and said, "Bella, I've made up my mind. If you want to have that baby, I'll take care of you and the child."

Isabella felt no trace of emotion. She just thought he was crazy, "Matthew, I've told you, my affairs have nothing to do with you!"

She suddenly broke free from Matthew and turned to leave.

But Matthew's voice came from behind her. "I've already posted on the campus network. Now everyone knows you're carrying my child."

His voice was loud, echoing throughout the lobby.

Isabella stopped in her tracks and turned to look at him with a pale face. "Matthew, are you out of your mind?"

Matthew wasn't angry, tenderly saying, "I can't stand by and watch you be wronged. I'll be waiting for you here, Bella."

Isabella thought Matthew was really crazy to run to the company and say such nonsense!

Isabella didn't say anything. She just turned and left.

When she disappeared, Matthew deflated like a balloon losing air. He looked down at the lunch box in his hand, smiling bitterly. "Bella, what should I do to win you back?"

"Hello," said a voice from beside him.

Matthew looked up and saw a stylishly dressed girl. The girl smiled at him. "I'm Laura, I'm in the same department as Isabella. Are you her boyfriend?"

"Yes." Matthew smiled.

Laura pointed to the lunch box in his hand. "Let me take this up to her for you."

Matthew handed it over immediately. "Thank you."

"You're welcome." Laura took it. "It's no trouble at all."

Sebastian's phone rang several times as he rode the elevator up. He opened the group chat and found a video Laura had sent. The thumbnail looked like it was Isabella.

he clicked on it Without hesitation.

"Bella, I've made up my mind. If you want to have the baby, I'll take care of you and the child."

Sebastian furrowed his brow deeply when he saw Matthew's familiar figure.

Could Isabella's boyfriend be his brother Matthew?

Did the child in Isabella's belly belong to Matthew?

When Sebastian walked out of the elevator, he happened to see Laura taking the lunch box to Isabella, loudly saying, "Isabella, your boyfriend is so good to you, he came all this way just to bring you a loving lunch."

The people around her echoed what she said.

"That's right. You have such a handsome and caring boyfriend. Where did you find him?"

"We're so envious of Isabella."

"When are you getting married? Isabella, you have to let us know."

Isabella felt choked when she saw at the lunch box. She picked it up and felt like throwing it in the trash. But as she stood up, she saw Sebastian.
###chapter 73 He Did It on Purpose
Isabella froze, wondering when Sebastian had appeared.

Laura and the others also noticed Sebastian, calling out "Mr. Landon" before dispersing.

Sebastian didn't say much. He just turned and entered the office, closing the door behind him.

Isabella felt inexplicably uncomfortable. She suspected Sebastian had heard those words, but she wanted that. Sebastian had Vanessa, and she couldn't interfere with Sebastian's feelings. Isabella had no intention of telling Sebastian about the child. It would be better for Sebastian to misunderstand the situation, and the distance between her and Sebastian could be maintained.

But she still felt sad.

In the office, Sebastian wasn't feeling great either. He placed the lunch box on the table and leaned back on the sofa to fidget, watching the birds flying by outside the window, Isabella's image filling his mind.

Sebastian understood his own feelings when he recalled Kelsey saying, "You like Isabella..."

But now his feelings didn't matter much. He wouldn't do anything to disrupt Isabella and Matthew, especially now that they were having a child!

In the afternoon, Sebastian took Jack out to discuss business and brought along an assistant.

Jack's gaze first fell on Isabella. Isabella understood, stood up, grabbed her notebook and pen, and put them in her bag.

But before she could take a step, she heard Sebastian say, "Laura."

Isabella paused, and the whole room went quiet for a few seconds.

Sebastian didn't even glance in her direction. He just called out her name and left.

Jack hesitated for a moment, looked at Isabella with some regret, and then followed.

Laura picked up her things, deliberately passing by Isabella's desk, smiling smugly at her.

As the three of them left, whispers filled the office, and the gazes directed at Isabella were filled with curiosity and schadenfreude.

At that moment, Kelsey came out. "Isabella, let's switch seats."

Isabella was puzzled. "Why?"

Kelsey was a rich young lady working as an assistant at the Landon Group and never hid her intentions. The entire office and everyone in the Landon Group knew that. It was hard enough to be in the same room as Sebastian, but in less than three days, Kelsey wanted to move out again.

Kelsey pursed her lips. "It's too much pressure to work under the boss's nose. I can't even slack off a bit. Let's switch back, quickly!"

Isabella wanted to say a few words, but Kelsey was adamant about moving back.

Isabella had no choice but to move back into Sebastian's office.

In the evening, Isabella was leaving the company with her bag, when a voice called out to her. "Isabella."

Isabella was startled and turned to see who it was, surprise filling her eyes, "Emma?"

Emma walked over, taking Isabella's hand and giving her a thorough look. "I haven't seen you in a long time. You've lost weight again, haven't you been eating well?"

Tears welled up in Isabella's eyes as she pulled her hand back. "Emma, Matthew and I have broken up."

Emma sighed. "I know. Matthew told me. He knows he was wrong. I understand your resentment, Bella. But the child is innocent."

It was peak hour as they stood outside the building. Many people were coming and going.

Emma said, "Get in the car. let's find a place to sit and talk."

Isabella bit her lip. When she was dating Matthew, he had taken her to meet Charles and Emma Landon. Although she had only met them once, both Charles and Emma had been very pleased with her. Emma liked her a lot.

After that, Isabella and Emma had spoken a few times over the phone. Emma had even prepared delicious food for her and asked Matthew to deliver it.

At that time, Isabella had naively believed that she and Matthew would continue to be very happy.

They would get married, have children, and grow old together.

There would be no parental objections, only blessings and expectations. Isabella couldn't believe how lucky she had been.

Isabella felt like she had been dreaming until the day she pushed open the dormitory door and saw that scene, shattering the unreal dream.

Emma had come to see her on purpose, probably because Matthew had said something to her. Isabella felt it was necessary to clarify things, so she got into Emma's car.

The driver took them to a high-end restaurant, where Emma held Isabella's hand and walked in, telling the waiter she had reserved a table.

As they were led to their table, Isabella was surprised to see that Matthew was already seated there. It seemed like he had been waiting for her and Emma for quite some time.

When Matthew saw Isabella and Emma approaching, he put down his phone, stood up, and pulled out two chairs.

Isabella deliberately chose a seat farthest away from him, while Emma sat close to her.

"Bella, what do you like to eat? I'm buying." Emma handed the menu to Isabella affectionately.

Isabella shook her head. "Emma, I didn't come here to eat. I..."

"Isabella!" Matthew interrupted her. "Let's eat first. We can discuss whatever you have to say after dinner."

Isabella ignored Matthew and turned to Emma. "Emma, I don't know what Matthew told you, but I came here to make things clear. Matthew and I have broken up, and the child in my belly is not his. My baby has no relationship to him. I'm sorry, Emma."

Emma glanced at Matthew, full of doubt. "But Matthew told me the child is his."

"It's not his!"

Emma looked at Matthew, then at Isabella, unsure whom to believe.

Matthew looked at Isabella and calmly said, "Bella, then tell Mom, whose child is in your belly?"

Isabella bit her lip, looking at Matthew.

He was doing this on purpose!

He knew this was a secret that couldn't be revealed!

When Emma saw this, she believed what Matthew had told her-that Isabella was refusing to forgive him, so she was deliberately denying the child's existence. The atmosphere at the table became tense. Emma smiled and changed that topic. "Let's not talk about this for now, we're all hungry. Let's eat first."

Emma ordered a table full of food, but Isabella had no appetite. She stood up. "Emma, I should go back."

Emma held her back. "Bella, just think of it as accompanying me for a meal."

After all, Emma was an elder. Since she had lowered herself like this for just one meal, Isabella didn't want to offend Emma. After hesitating, she sat back down.

"Have some more." Emma served Isabella more food, quickly filling her bowl.

Matthew had been silently peeling shrimp. His long fingers were getting dirty, but he didn't seem to mind. After he was done, he offered the shrimp meat to Isabella.

Isabella usually liked shrimp, but due to her pregnancy, the smell of shrimp made her nauseous at that moment.

Without waiting for Emma to ask, Isabella covered her mouth and hurried to the restroom.

Matthew stood up. "Mom, I'll go check on her."

Emma nodded. "Go quickly."
###chapter 74 After All, He is the Child's Father
Isabella finished vomiting. Matthew was waiting outside.

He handed her a wet tissue. "Wipe yourself down."

Isabella didn't take the tissue from him. "Matthew, how can you deceive your mother like this? How can you bear it?"

Matthew frowned. "Bella, I'm doing everything for you. Now that everyone knows about your pregnancy, do you really intend to bear the stigma for this child?"

"What does it have to do with you?"

"Of course it has something to do with me!" Matthew stood in front of Isabella. "I know everything is my fault. If I hadn't made a mistake and fallen for Samantha's trap, you wouldn't have been taken advantage of by Sebastian when you were sad and upset!"

Matthew gritted his teeth. His hands involuntarily clenched at his side. "What's done is done. No matter how much I say, it's useless. Bella, I won't blame you or look down on you. Bella, give me and yourself a chance. I know you still care about me. let's start over, everything will be as like it was before."

As Matthew spoke, he reached out to hold Isabella's hand.

Isabella panicked and dodged. "Matthew, I'll say it one last time, we can't be together!"

After Isabella finished speaking, she walked past him.

Suddenly, someone grabbed her arm, and Matthew pulled her over, pressing her against the wall.

Matthew acted quickly, holding her hands and then kissing her lips.

Isabella was stunned for a few seconds, then struggled hard.

At that moment, another voice suddenly came from beside her. "Mr. Landon."

Isabella's heart ached and she forgot to struggle.

Matthew took the opportunity to let go of Isabella's hands and hugged her tightly.

The corridor was dimly lit. From Sebastian's perspective, Matthew and Isabella were kissing passionately.

Laura stood beside Sebastian, casually glancing at the scene, covering her mouth in shock. "It's so hot, why does that person look so much like..."

"Are you deliberately showing me this?" Sebastian interrupted her words indifferently, his eyes scrutinizing Laura.

Laura was taken aback. "Mr. Landon, you have the wrong idea."

Sebastian obviously had no patience to listen to her explanation. "If this happens again, you can resign."

With those words, Sebastian walked away.

Laura breathed a sigh of relief, glanced at Isabella, and then left.

As Isabella heard the footsteps receding, her heart sank slowly.

Matthew's kiss was passionate and intense, but Isabella kept her lips tightly closed, refusing to give him a chance.

Finally, Matthew let her go.

Matthew's heart clenched when he saw the tears on her face. He reached out to wipe her tears. "Don't cry."

Isabella pushed away his hand and ran out.

Matthew furrowed his brow, calmed his emotions slightly, and walked out.

When he returned to the table, he saw Emma sitting there alone.

"Where's Isabella?"

Emma shook her head. "She hasn't come back."

When Emma saw Matthew's expression, she asked with concern, "Did you two fight again?"

"Yes." Matthew sat down, his gaze falling on Isabella's bag on the seat.

Emma advised, "Matthew, like I said, you really did something wrong this time. It's understandable that Bella is angry with you. Buy her something and try to persuade her to listen. I believe that Bella still cares about you and will definitely make up with you."

"Okay."

Isabella realized she had forgotten her bag after coming out of the restaurant. She turned back, and a car stopped in front of her. The car window rolled down, revealing Sebastian's face. He unlocked the door. His voice sounded a bit heavy as he said, "Are you going back to school?"

Isabella nodded. "Yes."

"Get in, I'll take you back."

Isabella shook her head. "No need."

"Get in!" Sebastian's voice grew a bit more stern. He sounded somewhat displeased.

Isabella's heart clenched, and she hesitated, but she opened the car door and got in.

The car accelerated. Isabella held onto the seat belt tightly, pressing herself against the seat, watching the night scene passing by outside the window. Her heart almost jumped out of her throat.

At this moment, Sebastian glanced at Isabella. When he saw her pale face and nervous expression, he felt a pang in his heart as he realized that he was speeding.

Sebastian slowly reduced his speed, drove off the highway at the intersection ahead, and headed towards Harvard University.

The car stopped in front of the women's dormitory building. Sebastian turned off the engine and turned to look at Isabella. "I'm sorry."

Sebastian didn't expect himself to lose control, since he was usually calm and steady. He had left after seeing Isabella and Matthew kissing in the restaurant and sat in the car for a while, not knowing where to go. He didn't want to go home, because Vanessa would surely be waiting for him in sexy lingerie, and he didn't want to go to Moon Club to see Zaire and others. He didn't want to be alone either, since he would feel even more bored that way.

Amidst his confusion, Isabella had appeared on the street. When he saw her, Sebastian felt like she was seeing a light.

He had gone up to her almost without thinking.

Sebastian realized that the shy and timid Isabella seemed to have a fatal attraction to him.

He couldn't help but be drawn to Isabella. Even thinking of her made him feel warm inside.

But when he remembered that Isabella belonged to Matthew, he felt extremely frustrated and restless.

Sebastian had never experienced such complex and unfamiliar emotions.

Isabella took a deep breath, calmly saying, "Thank you for taking me back, Mr. Landon. I'll go up now."

She opened the car door, but a large hand suddenly held her arm.

Sebastian's palm was warm. Isabella turned back in surprise. "Mr. Landon?"

"Isabella." Sebastian looked at her eagerly and he cleared his throat and said with some difficulty, "I seem to be sick."

The interior of the car was dim. Isabella felt a faint layer of sadness enveloping Sebastian when he said those words.

Isabella was about to say something, but Sebastian let go of her arm. He lowered his gaze, forced a bitter smile, and said, "Maybe I should see a doctor."

Isabella looked at Sebastian, wanting to say something. But she didn't know how to say it.

She felt uncomfortable too.

Sebastian's kindness to her during these days had been clear to her. But she had never thought of him in a romantic way, yet Sebastian's behavior had just made her feel that maybe Sebastian liked her.

Isabella's hand unconsciously touched her abdomen, and the doctor's words echoed in her ears.

"You should go back and talk to the child's father."

The child's father.

At this moment, Isabella's emotions were in turmoil, and she wanted to tell Sebastian about the child. She was already conflicted about whether to keep the child, so perhaps she should ask Sebastian about it. After all, he was the child's father.

Isabella bit her lip and said, "Mr. Landon."

The car phone suddenly rang, and Vanessa's name flashed on the screen.
###chapter 75 She's Different
When Isabella saw Vanessa's name, it was as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water over her head, instantly sobering her up.

What was she doing? She had just thought about telling Sebastian about the child.

Sebastian was a man with a fiancÃ©e. What was she thinking?

Sebastian noticed that Isabella didn't look right, so he reached out to decline Vanessa's call. "What did you want to say?"

Isabella shook her head. "It's nothing, Mr. Landon, I should go back to the dorm."

"Alright." Sebastian furrowed his brows as he watched Isabella get out of the car and leave, feeling a sense of emptiness. Isabelle's expression kept appearing in his mind, and he felt that Isabella seemed like she wanted to tell him something.

The phone rang again, interrupting Sebastian's thoughts.

He pressed the answer button, and Vanessa said, "Mr. Landon, it's late, why aren't you back yet?"

"What's up?" Sebastian looked out the car window. Isabella's figure had long disappeared, and all he could see was the empty staircase.

"It's nothing special, I was just worried about you, so I called to check on you." Vanessa's voice was filled with shyness.

Sebastian withdrew his gaze. "I'll be late, you go to sleep first, there's no need to wait for me."

"Alright." Vanessa paused, then added, "Be careful on the way home, stay safe."

"Okay."

After hanging up, Vanessa immediately called Samantha.

"Vanessa." Samantha had just answered the phone when the dorm door opened, and Isabella came in.

"Samantha, is Isabella in the dorm?" Vanessa asked.

Samantha glanced at Isabella, who seemed burdened with something and walked straight past her without even looking at her.

Samantha's gaze followed Isabella as she moved. "She just got back."

"Did she come back alone?"

"Yes." Samantha remembered something, paused, and said, "Wait a moment."

She took the phone and stood up, heading to the balcony.

When she looked down, she saw a black car parked downstairs. Samantha seemed to have discovered an earth-shattering secret and hurriedly reported to Vanessa, "Vanessa, I saw Mr. Landon's car downstairs at the dormitory, he must have brought her back..."

Before Samantha could finish her sentence, someone suddenly snatched away her phone.

Samantha was startled. She turned back to see Isabella and fell silent.

Isabella took her phone, glanced at it, and then hung up.

"What are you doing, Isabella? How dare you snatch my phone and hang up my call!" Samantha finally reacted and quickly took back her phone.

Isabella looked at her calmly. "Samantha, are you watching me for Vanessa?"

Samantha felt guilty for a moment. "So what if I am? If you haven't done anything wrong, why are you scared that I'm watching you fear?"

"Were you the one who posted about my pregnancy in the alumni group?"

Samantha's eyes flickered. "Just tell me whether you're pregnant or not!"

"Yes, I'm pregnant." Isabella no longer hid it.

"Is it Mr. Landon's child?" Samantha asked tentatively.

"No!" Isabella shook her head, placing her hand on her abdomen. "It's Matthew's!"

Samantha widened her eyes, pupils contracting. "You're making this up!"

"Matthew has posted about it on the campus network, you've seen it, right? If it's not his child, do you think he would rush to claim it?"

Samantha was speechless.

If the child was Sebastian's, then Matthew would definitely not want Isabella anymore. But if the child was Matthew's, then Matthew would have to break up with her and claim the child in her womb instantly. All those unreasonable behaviors suddenly made sense!

Samantha realized, "So he suddenly wanted to break up with me because of this?"

She stared at Isabella's belly, jealousy flashing in her eyes. "You're carrying Matthew's child?!"

"Yes." Isabella glanced behind her.

Samantha's attention was completely on Isabella's belly. There might have been a chance between her and Matthew before, but now that Isabella was pregnant, she had no chance at all!

She shook her head. "You can't have this child!"

"It's not up to you whether she has the child or not!" said Matthew.

Samantha suddenly turned around. "Matthew, why are you here?"

Matthew's gaze swept past Samantha's face, as if even a second's pause would hurt his eyes. He walked straight to Isabella, handed her the bag, and spoke very gently. "You left in a hurry."

Isabella took the bag and turned it over. She noticed that the bottle of folic acid was different from before.

She looked at Matthew.

Matthew calmly explained, "The one you bought wasn't good, so I changed it. You can take it with peace of mind."

He was acting like a father.

Isabella frowned. "Who said you could rummage through my bag?"

"I didn't. The folic acid pills fell out when I picked it up," Matthew said. He took out a bank card and handed it to her. "This is my supplementary card, the password is your birthday. Keep it."

"No need." Isabella rejected it without even looking at it.

She had always been self-reliant. Isabella had never taken a penny from Matthew even when they had been together before. Besides, Isabella had never thought about rekindling her relationship with Matthew, let alone spending his money.

Even though Isabella didn't care about the card, Samantha couldn't help staring at it. Samantha recognized that card. She had asked Matthew for it many times, but he had never been willing to give it to her!

Samantha had longed for it, but Isabella didn't care about it at all!

Samantha gritted her teeth resentfully. "Matthew, how can you treat me like this?"

Matthew looked back at her with an indifferent gaze. "I don't owe you anything."

The wind on the balcony was a bit chilly. Isabella didn't want to be bothered with Samantha and Matthew's entanglement and went back to the dorm. Once she was inside, Isabella considerately closed the balcony door.

Matthew furrowed his brows deeply when he saw that.

"Matthew." As soon as Isabella left, Samantha felt more at ease. She lowered her posture and softly pleaded, "Matthew, don't you want me anymore?"

"Samantha, our relationship was a mistake from the beginning."

"Yes, I schemed against you at first, but can you honestly say that you never thought about marrying me later on? You didn't refuse when we went to look at engagement rings, and you even carefully chose a style. You clearly wanted to spend a lifetime with me!"

Matthew fell silent for a few seconds. "Yes. I did intend to marry you at first, but you're dirty. I won't marry a dirty woman. My parents wouldn't agree either!"

"Is Isabella clean then? She's clearly been with Sebastian too!"

"Shut up!" Matthew suddenly turned stern.

Samantha was taken aback, then smiled. "See, you clearly care."

"I said shut up!" Matthew's eyes held suppressed anger.

Samantha bit her lip, approached Matthew, and softly said, "I won't say anything more, Matthew. If you want to reconcile with Isabella, it's fine. I can be there for you anytime as long as you want me."

"I don't need you." Matthew pushed her away.

Then he turned and walked away.
###chapter 76 Sour Boy and Spicy Girl
In the next few days, Sebastian went on a business trip.

Jack naturally followed him everywhere. But this time, Laura also went along because of work requirements. Because of this, Laura boasted a lot in the office before leaving.

The spacious CEO office seemed to belong to Isabella alone. It felt somewhat empty and quiet. Without Laura causing trouble, Isabella's work became much easier. She had regular working hours and a comfortable daily routine.

She was still experiencing some nausea, but it wasn't as severe as before. Apart from some morning sickness, she just felt a bit queasy the rest of the time.

To ensure the baby's nutrition, Isabella now had her meals on time. She also made sure to have a balanced diet. In just a week, she visibly gained some weight.

At meal times, Kelsey would usually come to see her.

"Isabella, let's go eat," she would say.

This had been happening every day recently. Since Kelsey had let go of her obsession with Sebastian, she had developed a love for the meals at the Landon Group's employee cafeteria. In her words, "Obsessions don't disappear, they just shift."

Her obsession with Sebastian had turned into an obsession with the cafeteria food. She would always drag Isabella along to eat with her.

Kelsey was quite excited as she looked at the food. "The cafeteria food is getting better and better."

Isabella, however, focused on the prices listed next to the food. "Do you remember how much the ribs we had the day before yesterday cost?"

"I think it was $10?" Kelsey replied.

Isabella shook her head. "It was $7."

"Right," Kelsey recalled. "You even remarked that the cafeteria food was getting tastier!"

"Look at today's prices!"

"The ribs are $5 per serving, what a deal!" With that, Kelsey ordered two servings.

Kelsey paid first. When it was Isabella's turn, the lady serving the food said, "This is all that's left. Why don't I give you a discount?"

Before Isabella could respond, Kelsey quickly said, "Sure, thank you."

In the end, Isabella's portion of sweet and sour ribs only cost $2.

As Isabella looked at the plate full of ribs, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

"What's wrong, Isabella?" Kelsey asked as she noticed her staring at the food.

Isabella raised her head. "Do you think these ribs could be from a sick pig?"

In the past, getting such a large portion of ribs for $2 would have made her ecstatic. But now, she had to consider the well-being of her child before eating anything. If it was meat from a sick pig, it wouldn't be good for the baby's development.

Kelsey was taken aback, then chuckled. "So that's what you're worried about. Don't worry, these pork ribs are not from sick pigs. They are top-quality pork ribs. Go ahead and eat!"

Isabella was skeptical. "How do you know?"

Kelsey thought for a moment and said, "Look, the Landon Group is a big company. They wouldn't compromise on food quality. And even if you don't trust the cafeteria, you have to trust Sebastian. He is very particular about food, and if the cafeteria dared to deceive him, they would have been in trouble long ago!"

That made sense.

Isabella couldn't find a reason to argue, so she took a bite of the ribs. Both the texture and taste were excellent. And it didn't taste like meat from a sick pig, so she felt a bit relieved.

Kelsey quietly breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that.

After dinner, Kelsey sneaked off to the water cooler to make a call, "Sebastian, you're really over the top. $2 for a portion of ribs almost scared Isabella away from the food!"

"Are you saying she didn't eat lunch?" said Sebastian.

"She did eat, but you need to be a bit more sensible if you want to enhance her nutrition. $2 for a portion of ribs? Even I wouldn't dare to eat that. It's a good thing I was there today, otherwise Isabella wouldn't have dared to eat even half a piece."

"I see, I'll have Jack take care of it later." Sebastian paused, then couldn't help but ask, "How's her appetite these days? Is the nausea severe?"

"It's pretty good. I noticed she always carries some sour plums in her bag. My mom used to say sour sons and spicy daughters, could Isabella be having a boy?"

"Sour plums?" Sebastian seemed to catch that part. "Alright, I got it."

Then he hung up the phone.

Kelsey rolled her eyes. "He got it? I mentioned the term, why isn't he happy?"

Sebastian held the phone, the words "sour sons and spicy daughters" echoing in his ears. How could he be happy? The child wasn't his!

The view outside was pleasant, but Sebastian couldn't appreciate it. His mind kept wandering back to Isabella. He had stayed away for a week, and he had dreamt of Isabella for five nights.

Sebastian seriously doubted the effectiveness of Marvin's "prescription" to him. Distance hadn't lessened his feelings. In fact, he was starting to miss her terribly.

He had followed Marvin's advice and flown out for a business trip. However, the effect was minimal. His longing for Isabella was becoming almost unbearable.

"Mr. Landon, this is the revised contract, please review it." Jack placed the document in front of Sebastian.

Sebastian glanced at it and closed the file. "Jack, tell the cafeteria not to reduce the prices of the meals too drastically."

"Understood."

"Also, the weather has been getting colder recently, and everyone's been working hard, so make sure the water cooler is stocked with some sour plums and nuts which should be nutritious and free of additives."

"Got it."

"Furthermore, have the finance department double-check the salaries and issue them by tonight."

Jack was puzzled. "But Mr. Landon, we usually pay salaries on the 15th. It's only the 8th today."

"From now on, we'll pay employee salaries on the 8th!"

Jack was very confused. Although he didn't understand why Sebastian was doing this, he agreed and made the necessary arrangements.

Isabella received her salary before she left work, but she thought it was a mistake.

When she inquired about it, she found out that everyone had been paid.

Someone asked the finance department about it and was told that the company had changed its policy. From now on, salaries would be paid around the 8th of each month. They would even be advanced on holidays.

"Mr. Landon is really awesome!"

"Mr. Landon is amazing!"

"We can go shopping tonight."

"I haven't eaten well in half a month, we'll feast tonight!"

The office was filled with a harmonious atmosphere. Everyone was smiling.

Isabella was also very happy. She had been eating well lately, and it wasn't just her meals. She was also buying appetizing snacks. 

With her check-up approaching, her pockets were almost empty. She had been worried, but the timely arrival of her salary was a relief. Isabella immediately booked her prenatal check-up  three days later. She had planned to buy some snacks after work, but when she went to the water cooler, she found a lot more snacks available.
###chapter 77 Sebastian's Heartfelt Return
Several six-tiered shelves had been placed against the wall, and each shelf was adorned with colorful baskets filled with various snacks. Among them was Isabella's favorite sour plum. The setup resembled a well-stocked mini supermarket.

Isabella peeled a sour plum and popped it into her mouth. The tangy sweetness immediately spread across her taste buds, pushing away any feelings of nausea, making her feeling much more comfortable.

"Looks like I don't need to buy snacks anymore!" Isabella muttered.

The Landon Group had unknowingly saved her some money, bringing a smile to Isabella's face and lifting her spirits.

At this moment, the surveillance camera above her flickered, capturing Isabella on screen, while Sebastian, miles away, couldn't help but smile as he watched her.

"Mr. Landon." Laura approached him. "It's time to leave."

Sebastian turned off his phone and got up to depart.

It was nine o'clock in the evening. 

After the social engagement, Sebastian returned to the car, loosening his collar, exuding a sense of weariness.

"Where's Laura?" Sebastian noticed her absence.

Jack replied, "She went to the duty-free store next door. She made a big deal and treated herself to some high-quality skincare products as a reward."

With that, Jack started the car.

From the backseat, Sebastian said, "Stop the car, let's go check it out too."

"Alright."

The two men entered the duty-free store, catching Laura just as she was about to pay.

Laura was taken aback when she saw them. "Mr. Landon, Jack, what brings you here?"

"Mr. Landon wanted to take a look..." Sebastian had already stepped into a specific section before Jack finished his sentence.

Sebastian was dazzled by the array of skincare products as he stood in front of the display. He casually picked up a brown essence bottle, examining the words on the label.

"Mr. Landon." Laura approached him. "Are you looking for men's or women's products? I have some knowledge about these brands, would you like me to recommend something?"

"Women's products."

Laura nodded. "What kind of skin type are we talking about?"

Isabella's face flashed through Sebastian's mind. "She looks fair and flawless. I'm not sure about her skin type."

Assuming he was referring to Vanessa, Laura suggested, "It's probably normal skin, for skin like that, hydration is key. You should probably stick to basic skincare. This brown set should be suitable."

Sebastian glanced at the ingredient list, asking, "Is it suitable for pregnant women?"

"Pregnant?" Laura was surprised. 'Vanessa is pregnant already, so soon.'

A hint of jealousy flashed in Laura's eyes, then she pointed to a nearby counter. "You should get that set, although it's a bit pricey."

Sebastian walked over to take a look. The set was priced at around fifteen thousand dollars.

It looked quite refreshing with its light blue bottle and semi-transparent design.

In the end, Sebastian chose the fifteen-thousand-dollar set. When the staff heard it was a gift, they brought out an exquisite packaging box, the elaborate presentation sparking Laura's jealousy once again.

Back at the hotel, Laura immediately called Vanessa.

Sebastian wanted to surprise Vanessa, so she would spill the beans about the surprise gift in advance, hoping it would help soothe her feelings of imbalance, she thought.

Vanessa was delighted when she learned that Sebastian had bought her a gift, especially since it was from a prestigious brand.

Laura couldn't help but express her jealousy since she was unhappy with the situation. "Vanessa, you're so lucky to have a child so soon."

Vanessa was taken aback. "What?"

"Vanessa, are we really friends?" Laura's growing sense of unease was palpable as she held the phone.

"Of course. You've always been my best friend, Laura."

"If that's the case, why didn't you tell me about your pregnancy?"

Vanessa was puzzled. "Who told you I was pregnant?"

Laura scoffed. "Stop lying. Mr. Landon bought you skincare products for pregnant women today. Why would he do that if you weren't pregnant?"

At this point, Vanessa understood what was going on and realized that the skincare set was meant for Isabella.

The doorbell rang.

Laura said, "Someone's at the door. Jack probably wants to see me. I'll talk to you later."

Laura ended the call and hurried to open the door.

Jack was standing at the doorstep.

"Jack, what brings you here?"

"I'm here to tell you to get ready, we have a flight in half an hour."

Laura was taken aback. "Where are we going?"

"Back to Lakina."

Even more puzzled, Laura asked, "Wasn't it planned for the day after tomorrow? And it took more than half an hour to get to the airport from here."

Jack simply replied, "Everything has been arranged by Mr. Landon, we just need to follow his lead."

"Alright."

Twenty minutes later, the three entered the elevator.

Jack pressed a button, and Laura casually glanced at the panel, realizing the elevator was going up, not down.

Her confusion deepened.

If they were supposed to go to the airport, why were they going up to the rooftop?

A few minutes later, the elevator reached the rooftop. A gust of wind blew as they walked out. Sebastian and Jack were unfazed in their coats and pants, but Laura, who was wearing a sleeveless emerald green dress, shivered in the wind.

A loud noise overhead signaled the approach of a helicopter.

It wasn't until the helicopter landed in front of them that Laura realized they were chartering a flight back to Lakina overnight!

Laura glanced at Sebastian, and although he remained composed, Laura couldn't shake the feeling that he really wanted to go home.

Only Vanessa could evoke such a response from Sebastian.

Vanessa was truly fortunate!

Early in the morning, Isabella woke up hungry.

When she opened her eyes, she saw a gray sky outside. It was still very early.

But Isabella was already famished.

She got up, washed up, grabbed a thermos, and headed downstairs to the cafeteria for breakfast.

The campus was shrouded in a thin mist in the early morning. It was really quiet around the dormitory area, only a few people were passing by.

As Isabella stepped out of the dormitory building, she spotted a black car parked in the mist. Isabella thought she was mistaken at first, but when she checked the license plate, she realized it was Sebastian's car.

Yet Sebastian was away on a business trip.

According to the plan, Sebastian would not be back for at least two more days. Seeing Sebastian's car here left Isabella puzzled.

As Isabella was wondering about it, the car door opened, revealing a tall and slender figure.

Sebastian was in a suit with slightly tousled hair. He appeared before her as if he had made a great effort to reach her. Despite a hint of weariness in his eyes, a gentle smile graced his lips as he looked at Isabella.
###chapter 78 The Child's Uncle
"Good morning," Sebastian said.

Isabella was stunned. "Mr. Landon?"

The mist swirled around him. Sebastian stood there in a white mist, looking unreal.

Isabella seriously thought she was still dreaming, but when she rubbed her eyes and looked at him again, Sebastian was standing in front of her!

"Mr. Landon?" she called out again, her heart beating uncontrollably.

"It's me," Sebastian replied softly.

God knows why Sebastian hurried back, not wanting to stay a moment longer. God knows he didn't want to go anywhere after getting off the plane, and driving straight to Isabella's dormitory. God knows how relieved and satisfied he felt after seeing Isabella's face. God knows how much he wanted to hug Isabella at this moment, but he had to restrain himself.

"Mr. Landon, you're back?" Isabella's voice gently struck his heart, softening Sebastian's core. "Yes. I just got back," Sebastian responded.

His gaze was intense, leaving Isabella somewhat flustered.

Sebastian glanced at the thermos cup in her hand and broke the silence. "Are you going out for breakfast?"

"Yes," Isabella replied.

"I rushed back. I didn't even have dinner last night." Sebastian rubbed his stomach, sounding somewhat aggrieved.

Isabella paused. "If you don't mind, would you like to have breakfast together?"

Isabella knew she should keep her distance from Sebastian, but she couldn't maintain her indifference any more now that he was here and the conversation had reached this point.

Seb's brow relaxed. "Sure."

They walked side by side toward the cafeteria. Since it was early, there weren't many people in the cafeteria, and it was quiet. Isabella grabbed two trays, handing one to Sebastian.

She walked ahead, with Sebastian following behind.

After breakfast, they found a place to sit down and eat.

Isabella glanced at Sebastian's tray and realized their breakfasts were exactly the same.

She had an egg, half a corn cob, and a cup of milk.

Sebastian had the same.

Isabella seriously suspected it was intentional.

Sebastian noticed Isabella's gaze and explained, "I didn't know what to eat, so I just followed you."

He then looked at the food on Isabella's tray. "Is this enough nutrition for you?"

"I'm eating small meals frequently now. I occasionally have appetizers too. I looked it up online, it's good for the baby," Isabella explained.

As she mentioned the baby, Sebastian's eyes deepened slightly and he nodded. "Yes. You should prioritize the baby now."

After that, they both ate silently and didn't say much.

After the meal, Sebastian said he would take her to the Landon Group.

Isabella paused in front of the car, pointing to a stain on his white shirt. "Mr. Landon, you should go back, take a shower, and change your clothes."

Sebastian glanced down, nonchalantly saying, "I'll just change at the office."

With that, he opened the car door, gesturing for Isabella to get in.

Isabella glanced at the car door but said, "You've been away on a business trip these past few days. Vanessa must be missing you. I'm sure she'd be happy to see you now."

Isabella was reminding Sebastian that he had a fiancÃ©e, Vanessa.

She was also reminding herself to be mindful of their respective positions.

She was deliberately creating distance between them.

A few seconds later, Sebastian closed the car door. "Be careful on your way to the office."

Isabella took a step back, lowering her gaze. "Thank you, Mr. Landon."

Sebastian didn't say anything more. He got into the car and drove away.

Sebastian drove to the Moon Club.

As he pushed open the door to Zaire's regular VIP room, he saw him lying on the bed with a woman, covered only by a thin sheet, barely concealing the quiet erotic scene.

"Mr. Landon, Mr. Jose is still resting," The manager, Daniel Taylor, followed him in, but didn't stop them.

Sebastian didn't even glance around. He sat straight on the sofa, rubbing his temples.

"Mr. Jose." Daniel turned around to find Zaire awake, sitting up from the bed.

Zaire waved him off, and Daniel hurriedly left.

Zaire covered the woman with the sheet, put on his clothes, and walked to the sofa. "You're not supposed to be back from Lakina yet, you were supposed to be there another two or three days, right?"

Sebastian didn't respond. He just kept rubbing his temples, looking quite troubled.

"Business trouble?" Zaire poured a glass of wine and handed it to him.

Sebastian pushed it away.

Zaire drank the wine, then said, "I heard from Kelsey that your assistant is pregnant."

At this point, Sebastian's fingers finally paused. He lifted his head.

Zaire smiled with satisfaction when he saw his reaction. "I knew you were interested in her. When did you manage to get her?"

Sebastian frowned. "Watch your words!"

There was a rogue vibe in Zaire's speech since he had spent a long time in places of debauchery.

"Alright, I'll rephrase it. When did you manage to win over your assistant?" Zaire teased.

Sebastian felt a bit agitated. "It's not what you think."

"What is it then? She's pregnant, and you've been arranging discounts at the cafeteria and providing snacks. How can you be so caring but not do it openly? This isn't like you."

All this information had been relayed to Zaire by Kelsey.

Zaire had initially been worried that Kelsey's unrequited love for Sebastian might lead to extreme actions, but she had unexpectedly let it go.

After that, Zaire had to endure half an hour of Kelsey's daily complaints, all revolving around Isabella and Sebastian.

Zaire was getting tired of it, but he had also caught an important piece of information from those conversations: Sebastian was genuinely serious this time!

"You want me to do it openly?" Sebastian sneered, "Wouldn't that be incest?"

"Incest?" Zaire's eyes lit up at the mention of this taboo topic. Leaning forward with curiosity, he asked, "What do you mean?"

Sebastian glanced at Zaire. "The child isn't mine."

"Then whose is it?"

"It's Matthew's."

Zaire raised an eyebrow. "So you're the child's uncle?"

Sebastian was speechless.

He felt like his heart had been stabbed.

"So, in that case, has Isabella become your sister-in-law?

"Wow, what a thrilling turn of events.

"Even though she's not your child, you're still so concerned about her. There aren't many uncles in the world as caring as you."

Sebastian felt like his heart was being torn apart.

After Sebastian left, Zaire stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, sipping his drink.

'Even Sebastian is fascinated with one person. Susan, why won't you come back?'

Suddenly, a soft body pressed against Zaire's back. Arms wrapped around him at the waist, and a lazy voice murmured, "Mr. Jose, please settle the bill from last night."
###chapter 79 Mr. Landon Gets Angry
Zaire turned around, caressing the woman's chin. "You're so impulsive. If you stay with, you'll have everything."

Miley was fair-skinned and beautiful. Both she and Isabella were university students who had not graduated yet, but she already had the charm of a woman and fascinated him deeply.

Unlike Sebastian, Zaire didn't like gentle waters. He preferred fiery passion.

Zaire hadn't changed partners for a month since he had gotten involved with Miley's flame.

Even he was surprised that he could waste so much time on Miley and not feel bored after being emotionally hurt.

Miley raised her red lips that were full of charm, saying "You're generous, Mr. Jose."

Zaire was delighted at just one sentence from her.

He set down his glass, bent over to pick up Miley, and continued.

When Sebastian returned home, he found that there were guests in the house.

"Sebastian." Matthew stood up from the sofa, calling out to him indifferently.

Sebastian glanced lightly at him, a layer of frost covering his eyes. "Why are you here?"

"I came here with Mom."

As soon as he said that, two people came down the stairs.

"Sebastian, you're back." Vanessa hurried down the stairs, running to Sebastian and reaching out to hug him. She was so excited that she didn't care about the presence of others.

Sebastian pushed her away, his gaze falling on Emma behind her without saying a word.

"Sebastian." Emma walked over, a harmonious smile on her face. "It's been a long time."

Sebastian frowned, indifferent to Emma's greeting. "I have severed ties with the Landon family for a long time. Why are the two of you are here today?"

"Sebastian, I know you may resent me, but that's all in the past. If I've done something wrong, I hope you can forgive me."

"Mrs. Landon, you're being polite. I can't afford to do that." Sebastian's attitude remained stiff. He was not even willing to soften his gaze.

Matthew took a step forward. "Sebastian, Mom misses Grandma, so I brought her to see Grandma. We have no other intentions, don't misunderstand us."

"After you're done, you can leave. I won't see you off." After Sebastian finished speaking, he went upstairs.

He entered the bedroom, hanging up his coat. Vanessa knocked on the door and entered.

"Sebastian."

Sebastian instinctively furrowed his brow when he heard her. "I've told you not to call me that."

Vanessa looked aggrieved. "I call you Mr. Landon in front of outsiders, but is it appropriate for me to call you Mr. Landon in front of family?"

Sebastian glanced at her. "I'm going to see Grandma."

Vanessa watched him leave, pursing her lips in frustration. Then she turned and looked at the suit jacket hanging on the rack, walking over to take the car keys from the pocket.

Zoe had recovered well after she had been discharged from the hospital.

She was even happier when she saw Sebastian return.

After a brief conversation, Zoe steered the conversation back on track. "Matthew and his mother were here, did you run into them?"

"Yes."

"Do you know why they came?"

"Weren't they here to see you?"

"That's secondary. According to Emma, your father's birthday is tomorrow. Matthew intends to take his girlfriend back to see them. She came here to invite me to go back and meet them."

Sebastian furrowed his brow. Isabella and Matthew already had a child, so this meeting with Emma and Charles was surely about discussing marriage. It was no wonder Emma valued it so much and had personally come to invite Zoe there.

When Zoe saw Sebastian was silent, she squeezed his hand and said, "You should bring Vanessa with you and come with me. Let them see that you also have someone by your side."

Sebastian fell silent as he thought of Isabella and said, "Okay."

As Sebastian came out of Zoe's room, he ran into Vanessa.

Vanessa was holding an exquisitely wrapped gift box. It was the set of maternity skincare products he had bought from outside town.

Sebastian's face suddenly turned cold when he saw that. "Who told you to take things without permission?"

Vanessa was taken aback. "Mr. Landon."

"Put it back!" Sebastian took the gift box from her hand and turned to walk downstairs.

When he reached the car, he opened the trunk and started to toss the gift box in. But he saw another gift box in the trunk, which made him a pause.

He turned around to see Vanessa standing at the door, tears swirling in her eyes. "Mr. Landon, I bought that."

Sebastian closed the trunk, walked up to her, and asked, "Why did you buy this?"

"My skincare products ran out."

"I asked you, why did you buy this? It's for pregnant women!" Sebastian realized something and looked at her stomach. "Are you pregnant?"

Vanessa was stunned.

She had bought that set of skincare products solely to make herself feel better. If Sebastian wouldn't buy it for her, she would buy it herself. Why should Isabella have something she didn't have, especially when she was Sebastian's fiancÃ©e!

But when Sebastian asked that question, Vanessa immediately thought of the child in Isabella's belly. If she had been the one in the tent that night, she would be the one pregnant now. If she had a child, she could win Sebastian's heart.

She could buy whatever Sebastian bought for Isabella.

But the child was something she couldn't have.

When Sebastian saw that Vanessa was silent, he took out his phone to call Marvin.

Vanessa had to speak up. "No, I'm not pregnant. I heard from a friend that this skincare set is gentle and non-irritating, so I wanted to try it out. I didn't know you bought it too. Did you buy it for me?"

"No." Sebastian visibly breathed a sigh of relief. "That's for a friend."

"Really?" Disappointment flickered in Vanessa's eyes.

Sebastian handed her back the gift box. "Get some rest."

With that, he walked past her.

Vanessa watched his retreating figure and gritted her teeth in frustration, realizing she needed to speed up her plans.

During lunch break, Jack asked Isabella to go downstairs to get some documents.

But the elevator went to the basement garage on the second underground floor.

"Jack, weren't we supposed to get some documents?"

"The documents are in the car," Jack said as he walked to the car. He opened the trunk and took out a beautifully packaged gift box, handing it to her.

The box had a logo on it. When Isabella saw it, she was stunned. "What's this?"

"It's a gift from a partner. I don't need to use it since I'm a man, so I'm giving it to you."

Isabella handed the box back. "This gift is too valuable, I can't accept it."

Jack scratched his head, a little troubled. "If you don't accept it, I'll be in trouble."

"What?" Isabella didn't understand the meaning of his words.

Jack explained, "If you don't accept such a valuable gift, I'll have bad luck."

"Huh?" Isabella didn't understand the meaning of his words.
Jack explained, "If you don't accept such a valuable item, I'll have to throw it away. Wouldn't that be a waste? I'd be punished by the heavens."
Isabella was speechless.
###chapter 80 Fear She Doesn't Want It
Isabella was speechless. She felt that Jack was acting strangely and his reasons were quite far-fetched.

However, since Jack sincerely seemed to want to give it to her, she couldn't ignore Jack's kindness and reached out to accept it, saying, "I'll take it then, thank you, Jack."

Jack breathed a sigh of relief. "You're welcome."

He then said to her, "You go up first. I have something to do."

"Okay." Isabella nodded and walked toward the elevator with the gift box in her arms.

Jack watched her figure disappear around the corner and turned back to walk toward the car. The window rolled down, revealing Sebastian's face.

"Mr. Landon, the item has been delivered according to your instructions." Jack wondered, "But why didn't you deliver it yourself?"

It was a valuable item. Since he had given it to Isabella in his name, it would have wasted Sebastian's goodwill.

Sebastian frowned. "I was afraid she wouldn't want it."

Jack was taken aback.

Many people would want it, but Sebastian couldn't care about them. Yet when it came to Isabella, he feared she wouldn't want it.

He had never seen Sebastian so lacking in confidence. It seemed that in Sebastian's eyes, Isabella was truly special.

"Let's go." Sebastian closed the car window.

Jack also got into the car and drove away from the underground garage.

Neither of them noticed Isabella standing at the corner, holding the box.

Isabella hadn't left. She had been hiding there all along and overheard Jack and Sebastian's conversation.

Something felt off to her. This skincare set was very expensive, and Jack was just an assistant manager. What kind of partner would be so generous and give away a $15,000 skincare set just like that?

If it was Sebastian, then everything would make sense.

Isabelle heard him say, "I was afraid she wouldn't want it." Isabella bit her lip, and suddenly everything became clear. Perhaps all the recent unusual occurrences at the company had been orchestrated by Sebastian.

Isabella took out her phone, opened her social media, and found Vanessa's status from last night.

"Thank you to Mr. Landon for his kindness."

There were two pictures, one of the beautifully packaged unopened gift box, and the other of the opened box displaying a set of exquisite skincare products.

It was exactly the same as what Isabella was holding in her hands.

Clearly, Sebastian had prepared two of the same gifts.

Isabella bit her lip, feeling a bit confused.

She would never want this gift box no matter what, so when she returned to the office, she placed it on Sebastian's desk. She gave it back. 

But because of this incident, Isabella was distracted the entire afternoon.

In the evening, Miley suddenly called her, saying she was in the hospital. She asked if Isabella could come over.

Isabella bought some fruits and hurried over. When she entered, she saw Miley leaning on the hospital bed, a hint of paleness on her delicate face.

"Isabella, you're here." Miley squeezed out a smile, pure and beautiful, tinged with a sickly beauty.

Isabella placed the fruits on the bedside table. "What's wrong with you?"

"I had a minor surgery, but it's a bit scary being alone in the hospital. And I don't have many friends. I called you over so suddenly, hope I'm not bothering you?" Miley, now makeup-free, looked refreshing without her usual charm.

Isabella shook her head. "It's fine. I just finished work."

With that, she took out an orange and peeled it for Miley.

Miley looked at her. "Why aren't you asking what surgery I had?"

Isabella was taken aback. "That's private."

Miley smiled. "It's not a big deal. I just had an abortion and lost a child."

She was smiling, but a hint of sadness flickered in her eyes.

"Abortion?" Isabella, now pregnant herself, was sensitive about anything related to children. "What happened to you?"

A tinge of self-blame flashed in Miley's eyes as she lowered her gaze and softly said, "I didn't know at first, so took a lot of medication. The doctor said with such a large dose, it was best to terminate for the sake of the child."

Isabella's mind went blank, "You couldn't keep it even with medication?"

"It's not a certainty," Miley said. "But for safety, it was better not to."

Miley then looked at Isabella's belly. "You must be a few months along now, right?"

"Yes." Isabella subconsciously protected her abdomen, feeling worried. She had taken expired birth control pills, and no one could guarantee those pills wouldn't affect the baby.

After that, she had been hospitalized for a drip and had applied medicine to the external wound.

Isabella had no experience in this area, and hearing Miley's words made her increasingly anxious.

So when she came out of Miley's place, she made an appointment, and consulted the doctor.
The doctor, looked concerned after listening to her long explanation. But no one could guarantee anything. The doctor just told Isabella that if she didn't want it, she should consider having an abortion soon. If she decided to keep it, the earliest prenatal screening would have to be between three to four months. If there was a risk of deformity at that time, an abortion would be necessary.
The doctor explained the differences and risks of the two procedures to her, and also suggested that if she couldn't make a decision, she should go back and discuss it with her family.
How could Isabella dare to tell Nina about this?
Besides, Nina was not having an easy time herself. Isabella was a grown up and didn't want Nina to worry anymore.
But she felt really helpless facing this situation alone.
On the way back, she searched online for a lot of information, but couldn't find any answers, which only added to her anxiety.

Matthew was waiting for her when she returned to the dorm.

Isabella tried to lift her spirits and said, "I told you not to come see me anymore."

Matthew ignored her. He turned and handed her some washed fruits. "I bought you some fruits, all cleaned. It's good to have fruits and supplements during pregnancy. I'll buy them for you every day from now on."

Isabella brushed his hand aside, hung up her bag and coat, then drew the curtain and crawled into bed.

She couldn't be bothered with him.

Matthew pulled back the curtain, stood by the bed, and said, "You don't look well, what's wrong?"

He reached out to hold Isabella's hand, but she evaded him.

"I'm tired and I want to rest. Please leave." Isabella turned over, facing away from him.

Matthew set down the fruits and sat on a stool. "I'll stay with you."

Isabella sat up abruptly, her eyes moist as she stared at him. "I told you to leave me alone. I want to be alone, can't you stop bothering me all the time? Do you realize how embarrassing it is for you to do this, Matthew?"

Matthew was stunned.

There was a moment of silence in the room.

Matthew stood up and said, "I know you're not in a good mood. And mood swings during pregnancy are normal. I won't argue with you. I've already talked to my parents, and I'll take you to meet them tomorrow."

Isabella shook her head. "I'm not going."

Isabella lay back down, wrapping herself up like a cocoon.

Matthew stared at her back for a while, then said in a deep voice, "You will go."

Isabella closed her eyes, not wanting to say another word to him.

"Rest well, I'll come pick you up early tomorrow." Matthew left.
###chapter 81 A Way Out
Matthew's words didn't bother Isabella at all.

She fell asleep in no time, perhaps because she was thinking about her situation so much.

When she woke up, it was the next morning.

Samantha's bed was empty. Since she had broken up with Matthew, she didn't come back often, which made Isabella feel more at ease.

Isabella got out of bed to freshen up. Since she had gone to sleep without showering last night, she felt sticky and dirty. She grabbed some clothes and headed to the bathroom for a shower.

As she came out of the bathroom, there was a knock on the dormitory door.

She walked over to open the door. It was Matthew.

Isabella held the doorknob, not intending to let him in. "Why are you here again?" she asked.

Matthew was dressed in a dark blue casual outfit. A few stray strands of hair fell over his forehead. Despite the sunlight shining behind him, Isabella no longer felt any attraction toward him.

His gaze swept over Isabella's hair cap. His eyes were gentle yet ambiguous. "Have you taken a shower?" he asked.

Isabella started to close the door, but Matthew stopped her with his hand.

"I've come to bring you some clothes," he said, lifting the bag in his hand.

"I have clothes to wear, I don't need you to bring me any," Isabella replied without even looking at the bag.

She used her foot and hands to push the door to close it firmly. After quickly locking the door and completely isolating Matthew outside, she finally relaxed and went to blow-dry her hair.

Halfway through drying her hair, she saw Matthew in the mirror.

Isabella was so startled that she dropped the hairdryer, which landed in the sink. She turned around in shock and stared at Matthew. "How did you get in?"

She was sure she had locked the door!

Before she could say anything more, she noticed the key in Matthew's hand.

Isabella's scalp tightened. "How did you get the key to our dorm?"

"This?" Matthew opened his palm. "Samantha gave it to me."

Isabella reached out to grab it, but Matthew avoided her easily.

"I've put the clothes on the table. Change into them, I'll wait for you outside," he said before leaving.

After she was done blow-drying her hair, Isabella saw a gift box on the table. Inside was a dark blue casual outfit identical to Matthew's. It was clearly a couple's outfit.

Isabella tossed the clothes into a bag, ready to head toward the door. Just then, her phone rang.

It was Nina.

Isabella calmed her emotions slightly and answered the phone. "Hello, sis."

"Bella, your brother-in-law and I have already set off. Are you there?" Nina asked.

Isabella was taken aback. "Set off? Where are you going?"

"Charlie said you were going to surprise us today." Nina sat in the car, holding the phone and looking at Charlie beside her, asking softly, "What's going on?"

Charlie gestured for her to put the call on speakerphone.

Nina did so and held the phone to his lips.

Charlie spoke on the phone as he drove. "Bella, Matthew contacted me a couple of days ago."

Isabella was stunned.

No wonder Matthew had been so confident that she would come. He had gone behind her back to see Charlie!

Isabella knew Charlie too well. Matthew must have shown Charlie that he was an important person or offered Charlie enough benefits to use Nina to pressure her.

"Bella, your sister has been worried about you since you moved out. I wanted to surprise her too, so I didn't tell her about this. I planned to let you tell her in person when we all meet," Charlie explained.

Isabella gritted her teeth. "Fine, you guys go ahead, I'll be there ."

A few minutes later, Isabella opened the dormitory door.

Matthew was outside, looking down at his phone. When he saw the door open, he put away his phone, stood up straight, and looked toward her.

His gaze swept down Isabella. "Why aren't you wearing the outfit I bought you?"

Isabella handed him the bag. "I don't like it, you can have it back."

Matthew frowned but accepted it.

As they walked toward the car, Isabella noticed Matthew reaching out a hand to hold hers.

She dodged it.

Isabella quietly opened her phone, called Samantha and asked, "Matthew, are you sure you want me to go to your house and meet your parents?"

"Absolutely," Matthew affirmed. "Bella, don't you remember our agreement from the beginning? We said we would get married after graduation. We're graduating in a month, so we'll meet my parents now, set the engagement for a month, and then get married. It might seem rushed, but I'll take care of everything. Our wedding will be perfect, I promise. You might not be sure about this now, but I have a way to make you marry me willingly and happily."

Isabella felt uneasy and turned to him. "Did you go see Charlie?"

"I did. Bella, I know that you care very much about your sister."

"Despicable!" Isabella cursed.

Matthew just smiled lightly. "Don't worry, as long as you behave, I promise Charlie will treat your sister well."

"What did you promise Charlie?" Isabella clenched her fists.

Matthew pursed his lips. "That's between him and me. Just know that if you behave, Charlie's crisis will be averted. Otherwise, Charlie will face a disaster, and your sister will be affected."

"Do you think I'll bow down to your threats?" Isabella tightened her fists.

Matthew stopped the car at a red light, turned to face Isabella's angry eyes, and said, "Bella, this isn't a threat. I'm giving them a way out just because of you."

Isabella looked at Matthew, feeling that the person in front of her was unfamiliar.

She used to think of Matthew as gentle and sunny, someone who exuded warmth. That was what she had liked most about him, but ever since he got involved with Samantha, the image of Matthew she had in her mind had started to deteriorate.

And now, he was shrouded in darkness.

Isabella couldn't understand him now. She found it frightening.

As they approached the mansion area where the Landon family resided, Isabella saw Charlie's car from a distance. Charlie and Nina were standing beside it.

Matthew drove over, and Charlie immediately came forward to greet them.

"Matthew, Bella, you're here," Charlie said with a flattering smile on his face. It made Isabella feel physically uncomfortable.

Matthew glanced at Isabella through the rearview mirror, and politely asked Charlie, "Why aren't you going in?"

Charlie pointed to the security booth, looking embarrassed. "We couldn't specify the exact house number, so we were stopped outside."
###chapter 82 A Happy Event
It turned out that they had been stopped outside the door!

It was obvious that Matthew looked down on Charlie, so he had only given him the address of the mansion area without telling him the house number.

"My mistake." Matthew looked apologetic. "I only sent you a location. I forgot to tell you the house number."

Charlie waved his hand. "It's okay, we just arrived not long ago anyway. We'll just go in together with you."

Matthew nodded. "Shall we go in together?"

"Sure." Charlie nodded and bowed. "You go in first, we'll follow behind you."

Isabella glanced around as the car drove into the mansion area.

"What are you looking for?" Matthew's voice came faintly.

At this moment, the car had entered the mansion area covered by greenery on both sides of the road.

Isabella withdrew her gaze. "Nothing."

Matthew drove the car skillfully. "Oh, I almost forgot to tell you that my brother will also be here today."

Isabella was startled. "Mr. Landon?"

"Yes." Matthew raised his eyes and looked at her through the rearview mirror. "So you better not say that the child is not mine. Don't make him suspicious."

Isabella bit her lip in silence.

She originally intended to explain things to Charles and Emma, but if Sebastian was present, she really couldn't speak her mind!

Since they were all here, she thought it was useless to dwell on it. She had to take it step by step.

When they arrived at the Landon family house, Isabella sent the location to Samantha, specifically marking the house number of the Landon family home, fearing that Samantha might not be able to get in later.

Samantha didn't reply.

lsabella didn't know if Samantha would come.

"Bella." Nina walked over.

Isabella quickly put away her phone and put a smile on her face. "Sis."

Nina saw everything. "Bella, when did you start dating and why didn't I know anything about it?"

"We've been dating for over a year," Isabella said. "But we broke up in between."

"Are you back together now?" Nina asked. "What caused the breakup in the middle, and how did you reconcile? You usually can't hide anything from me, but you managed to keep your boyfriend a secret for over a year!"

Isabella was about to reply when a black car drove into the Landon family's courtyard and stopped not far from them.

Isabella's heart sank when she saw the car.

She thought Matthew had just teasing been her. She hadn't expected Sebastian to actually come!

And Sebastian wasn't alone. He was accompanied by Vanessa and Zoe.

"Zoe?" Nina was slightly surprised when she saw Zoe.

Isabella and Nina walked up together.

"Nina, Bella, what a coincidence, you're here too?" Zoe was very happy when she saw Isabella and Nina. Vanessa had been supporting her, but she let go of Vanessa's hand and held Isabella and Nina with both hands.

Vanessa's expression changed slightly, but she quickly put on a smile. She stood behind Zoe and said, "Grandma, you don't know it yet, but Isabella is Matthew's girlfriend."

"What?!" Zoe was shocked and disbelieving. "When did this happen? why didn't I know anything?"

Nina smiled bitterly. "I was kept in the dark too."

"Sis." Isabella felt guilty.

Isabella hadn't intended to keep it a secret. She just wanted to wait until the relationship was stable before mentioning it. But before she could say anything, she had caught Matthew having sex with Samantha. At that time, Nina was having a hard time on a regular basis, and she didn't want to cause her more trouble because of that. Isabella just thought that she would never have anything to do with Matthew again.

She didn't know that Matthew would make things so complicated today. He hadn't even given her a chance to explain.

"Great!" Zoe smiled. "I really like Bella and I liked her from the first time we met. She's very pleasing to the eye. I once thought that if Bella could be my granddaughter-in-law, that would be great. Now my wish has finally come true."

As Zoe spoke, she subconsciously glanced at Sebastian. Zoe still had some regrets in her heart. She liked Bella and hoped Bella could be with Sebastian.

But fate was something that could not be resisted.

Sebastian now had Vanessa. Bella and Matthew were also a good match. That was satisfactory.

Vanessa smiled again. "Grandma, there's more happy news."

"What is it?" 

Vanessa smiled and looked at Isabella.

For something like pregnancy, it would be more meaningful if Isabella said it herself.

At this moment, Emma and Matthew came out.

"Mom," Emma called out, then glanced at Sebastian. She warmly took Vanessa's hand. "Vanessa is here too."

Matthew then introduced everyone. "This is my grandma, my brother and Vanessa."

"We shouldn't stand around outside, everyone,. Tea and snacks are ready, so let's all go in and sit down." Emma took on the role of a gracious hostess and warmly invited everyone in.

As everyone walked toward the house, there was suddenly a rustling in the nearby bushes, and a person crawled out from inside like a monkey, quickly running to Zoe.

"Ah..." Since Zoe was older, she couldn't help but be frightened.

The sudden movement scared her. She grew pale.

Vanessa hurried forward to protect Zoe. Everyone stepped back and finally looked at the person who had crawled out.

It was a child, named Thomas Martinez, who was about seven or eight years old. He was pulling something out of the bushes at the moment, and he suddenly joyfully pulled out a large green caterpillar. Thomas lifted the caterpillar by its tail, and the caterpillar twisted into various shapes on his finger while he stared at it with shining eyes.

It was truly creepy, especially for someone like Isabella who was naturally afraid of soft-bodied creatures. Just a small insect was enough to make her scream for a long time, let alone a brightly colored large caterpillar.

But what Thomas did next was even more unsettling. He suddenly opened his mouth and threw the large caterpillar into it. As he chewed a few times with his cheeks bulging, it seemed like caterpillar juice was flowing from the corners of his mouth.

"Ew!" Isabella felt her stomach churning. She covered her mouth and dry heaved.

"Bella." Nina reached out to support her.

Matthew walked over, reached out to shield her, and handed Isabella a handkerchief to cover her mouth and nose. "Let me take you to the bathroom."

Nina let go. Matthew took Isabella's arm and led her into the house.

Nina frowned deeply when she saw that.

Isabella's stomach was churning badly. She vomited up her breakfast and a lot of bitter water.

Matthew stood by, frowning and patting her back to calm her, feeling extremely distressed.

After Isabella finished vomiting, he helped her to the sink to rinse her mouth and wash her hands.

"Sir." A servant brought a bowl of sugar water over.

"Give it to me." Matthew took it and blew on the edge before handing it to Isabella.
###chapter 83 My Brother is Watching
Isabella waved her hand. "I don't want to drink, thank you."

She felt a bit nauseous as she finished her sentence,.

Her mind was filled with images of Thomas twisting a distorted large green caterpillar and throwing it into his mouth.

Isabella closed her eyes and asked, "Whose child was that?"

"It's a maid's kid. Her name is Karen Martinez." Matthew paused. "What's wrong?"

Suppressing the urge to vomit, Isabella asked, "He looks like he's about seven or eight years old, why is he like that?"

"Karen took some medication back then, which affected the child's development. Thomas was born with an intellectual disability and some neurological issues."

"Bella, what's wrong with you?" Matthew reached out to support her. "Why is your face so pale?"

Isabella shook her head and couldn't help but ask, "Didn't Karen go for a check-up back then to see if it was a deformity?"

"They said that she did go for a check-up, but nothing was found. Sometimes, even check-ups are not one hundred percent accurate and there are quite a few misdiagnoses."

Isabella bit her lip, unsure how to describe her current feelings.

If Karen Martinez had known that he would be born like this, it would have been better not to have him at all. Unfortunately, fate played tricks on people. Karen had no choice, and neither did Thomas.

Isabella stood by the window, watching Thomas playing in the nearby grass.

"Have a glass of water." Matthew appeared by her side.

Isabella took the glass. "Thank you."

Matthew glanced outside for a moment, then turned back to Isabella. "Karen once tried to send the child to an orphanage, but the environment there was poor. It was full of disabled children. She couldn't bear to part with her child, so she brought him back and raised him by her side. Karen was an elderly person in the family, and my mother had sympathy for her and felt sorry for her, so she allowed her to bring the child to work. Usually, the child plays alone in the yard, and we've all gotten used to it. Don't it mind too much, it's very sad."

Isabella was touched by Matthew's words, and her tone softened. "Emma is a good person."

"What about me?" Matthew lowered his gaze to her. "Am I a good person?"

Isabella avoided his gaze. "Matthew, we can't go back."

"We can." Matthew held Isabella's shoulder, turning her to face him, "Bella, I was terribly wrong before. I missed out, so I realized how important you are to me. I will cherish you even more in the future. Bella, can you give me a chance?"

Isabella remained silent.

Matthew continued, "You and Nina have already endured enough hardships in the first half of your lives. Let me shield you from the storms in the second half, okay?

"I will treat you well, and I will be a good husband and father.

"I know you've always wanted a peaceful and stable life. As long as you're with me, I will give you everything."

"Matthew, I..." Isabella was about to say something when Matthew suddenly embraced her.

He held her tightly. "Bella..."

Isabella tried to push him away, but at that moment, Matthew whispered softly in her ear, "My brother is watching."

Isabella froze.

Matthew frowned disapprovingly as he sensed her stiffness, then gently stroked her back. "Bella, I'll treat you well. We'll have a happy family. You don't want the child to be born without a father, do you?"

Isabella hesitated for a moment, thinking of Sebastian's presence. She did not push Matthew away.

"Mr. Landon?" Charlie suddenly appeared from somewhere, breaking the silence.

Isabella took the opportunity to push Matthew away, but he grabbed her hand and held it in his palm.

Matthew led Isabella toward Sebastian and Charlie. "Sebastian, Mr. Charlie."

Charlie smiled. "Are you still calling me Mr. Charlie? After this meal, you should start thinking of me as your brother-in-law."

"Okay." Matthew nodded and casually said, "Brother-in-law."

"Great." Charlie was ecstatic and trembling with excitement.

He was thrilled that he would be related to the Landon family.

After the excitement settled, Charlie realized, "Matthew, Mr. Landon is your brother. You all have the Landon surname. I thought it was a coincidence, but you're actually a family. Once Bella crosses the threshold, we'll all be family with Mr. Landon."

Sebastian gave Charlie a cold glance. "Who said we'll be family?"

Charlie was dumbfounded.

As he was about to speak, Matthew said, "You are still my brother."

Charlie was puzzled.

He looked at Sebastian, then at Matthew. It turned out that Sebastian and Matthew were not addressing him, but the atmosphere between the two brothers was very tense.

Sebastian looked away, noticing Matthew and Isabella's intertwined fingers. He furrowed his brow irritably.

Matthew tightened his grip on Isabella's hand, as if afraid she would slip away. But his gaze remained fixed on Sebastian's face. "Sebastian, Bella is at your company. She'll need your care."

Isabella whispered, "I'll take care of myself, there's no need to trouble Mr. Landon."

Sebastian furrowed his brows harshly. Compared to Matthew's provocation, Isabella's words were more cutting.

"Sebastian." Vanessa's voice rang out as she walked over, naturally standing by his side and linking her arm with his. "Bella, Matthew, you're here. Emma just said you go to somewhere to talk privately."

Silence fell.

No one responded to Vanessa's words, and the atmosphere became slightly awkward.

Charlie seized the opportunity to say. "So, you're Mr. Landon's fiancÃ©e. You look like a perfect match."

Vanessa smiled. "Hello, you can call me Ms. Field."

"Ms. Field." Charlie quickly extended his hand, flattering her. "Please take care of me in the future."

Vanessa smiled faintly, "We're all family. It's natural to offer help mutually."

Before anyone could say more, Sebastian's gaze swept over them, frosty and displeased.

Vanessa stiffened, quickly retracting her hand and re-linking it with his arm. "Emma's calling us to dinner, let's go."

Sebastian's phone rang, he glanced at it, then pulled his arm away from Vanessa. "I have something to attend to. I need to leave. You all enjoy your meal."

"Sebastian!" Vanessa hurried after him.

As they walked away, Isabella pulled her hand back from Matthew's grasp and turned to leave.

Only Charlie and Matthew remained at the scene.

Charlie said, "Matthew, I brought Nina over as you instructed. What about the contract?"

"Don't worry, I've already arranged everything," Matthew said.

Charlie's face lit up. He patted his shoulder. "Matthew, you're a reliable man. Thank you."

Matthew glanced at Charlie, brushed off where he had been touched, and coldly said, "Once things are settled between Bella and me. I'll give you another contract. When Bella and I get married, there will be generous gifts. We will rely on you even more in the future, Brother-in-law."

Charlie dropped open in surprise and joy. He hastily responded, "Of course."
###chapter 84 Not His
At the entrance of the suburban area.

Samantha rushed over, but the security guard, Anthony Thomas, stopped her outside.

"I've said it many times. I'm Mr. Landon's girlfriend!"

Anthony looked disdainful, "Sorry, madam, we called the Landon family. But they said Mr. Landon's girlfriend is currently with the Landon family!"

"Let me in!" Samantha tried to push her way in.

Anthony pushed her out. Due to the excessive force, Samantha stumbled and fell to the ground.

"You!" Samantha was furious.

Anthony said, "I'm sorry. You can't go in without the Landon family's permission."

Just then, a car drove up.

Anthony immediately opened the parking barrier.

But because Samantha was sitting in the middle of the road, the car couldn't pass and had to stop in front of her.

The car window rolled down. Anthony walked over. "Sorry, Mr. Landon, we'll handle it right away."

Another security guard walked up to Samantha, trying to help her up from the ground.

Samantha saw this as an opportunity and refused to get up. "Unless you let me in, I'll sit here today and see who dares to touch me!"

"What's going on?" Sebastian asked as he leaned out.

"She's here to see Mr. Matthew. She's claiming to be his girlfriend. But we've already called and confirmed that Mr. Matthew's girlfriend is currently visiting the Landon family. She's lying." 

Sebastian glanced forward, raising an eyebrow. "Her?"

Anthony hurriedly asked, "Do you know her?"

Sebastian smiled lightly, a hint of playfulness in his dark eyes behind the sunglasses. "Let her in."

Anthony hesitated. "But..."

"I know her. She is Mr. Matthew's girlfriend."

"But the Landon family said Mr. Matthew's girlfriend is inside."

"It's normal for there to be some misunderstanding between a young couple. If they clear it up, and if Matthew Landon finds out you've embarrassed his girlfriend at the door, do you think he'll forgive you?"

After a moment of thought, Anthony realized it might be true.

They couldn't afford to offend any household in this suburban area.

It was better to let her in since it might cause trouble later. Perhaps Mr. Matthew would even be grateful to them.

So, Anthony allowed Samantha to enter.

Samantha hurried to see Matthew. She left in a hurry and didn't even notice who was in the car.

Sebastian drove the car out of the suburban area but didn't go far, stopping by the road to smoke.

At the Landon family, a group of people had just sat down when Samantha burst in.

"Matthew, you owe me an explanation!" Samantha said as she entered, then collapsed on the ground, sobbing.

"Why are you here?" Matthew stood up abruptly and immediately instructed the servants to take Samantha away.

Samantha struggled fiercely, almost scratching every servant who came near her.

The servants of the Landon family had all never seen such a scene before and were too scared to approach her.

Emma asked Matthew, "What's going on?"

"I'll handle it right away, Mom." Matthew said. He walked over to Samantha, grabbed her arm, and dragged her out.

"Matthew Landon, you can't treat me like this!" Samantha screamed, her voice echoing through the entire restaurant.

But Matthew ignored her screams. He dragged her out as if she was trash.

He quickly dragged Samantha to the entrance. She clung to the door frame, shouting, "Matthew Landon, I'm pregnant!"

Matthew froze.

The whole room fell silent.

Nina's first reaction was to turn back. She looked at Isabella, full of concern.

But Isabella just smiled at Nina, indicating that she wasn't worried. After all, she had brought Samantha here.

Emma was astonished, while Charles Landon stood up abruptly, feeling like he had been utterly disgraced.

Samantha broke free from Matthew's grasp and crawled to Charles and Emma, banging her head on the ground, "Charles, Emma. I'm Samantha. I'm Matthew's girlfriend. Isabella and Matthew have broken up, and I'm carrying the flesh and blood of the Landon family in my belly!"

Emma could hardly believe it. Her worldview crumbled instantly.

Charles didn't even look at Samantha. He just stared at Matthew coldly. "How will you explain this?"

Before Matthew could say anything, Samantha pulled out a pregnancy test report. "This is the report I just got from the hospital!"

No one took her report.

A few seconds later, Matthew walked over, took the report, and examined it carefully. His pupils contracted suddenly when he read it.

When Samantha saw his expression, she said, "That is a report from Regional Medical. If you're not convinced, you can call a doctor to come and test my blood right away!"

Regional Medical was the best hospital in Lakina.

Samantha had been well-prepared since she had brought the report here.

Matthew clenched the report as he stared at Samantha, his teeth almost grinding. Suddenly, he realized something and looked up at Isabella.

Isabella sat there quietly, with calm and indifferent expression on her face. She seemed at peace, exuding a sense of relief.

Emma was the quickest to react. She instructed the servants to call the family doctor and turned to Isabella. "Bella, don't worry. We need to verify everything."

Isabella stood up. "Emma, Samantha is telling the truth. Matthew and I actually broke up a long time ago. He's been dating Samantha, so of course Samantha would have his child."

Emma was speechless as she looked at her belly. "But you're pregnant too."

Isabella bit her lip, "This child is not Matthew's."

"What?!" Emma couldn't sit still. She was very shocked. She stood up too.

"I'm sorry Emma. I should have explained this to you last time." Isabella looked guilty, but her voice was calm but firm.

Emma turned to Matthew, seemingly seeking confirmation.

Matthew stood there looking as if the soul had been sucked out of him, exuding a sense of desolation and failure.

Actions spoke louder than words. Matthew's silence gave everyone the answer.

The family doctor arrived quickly, and Samantha was taken in for examination.

Isabella didn't want to know the results because she had done what she needed to do. As she left the Landon family, she felt relieved.

"Isabella!" Vanessa caught up with her.
###chapter 85 A Kindness
"Isabella, did you say that on purpose?" Vanessa looked at her in concern. "You were trying to help Samantha and Matthew, so you deliberately said the child isn't Matthew's, right?"

Isabella shook her head. "No. I spoke the truth."

Vanessa glanced at her belly. "Then whose child is this?"

"It doesn't matter."

Vanessa looked at her. "What do you mean?"

"Nothing." Isabella shook her head and walked over when she saw Charlie and Nina coming out of the house.

"Sis."

As soon as Charlie saw Isabella, he frowned and said, "Bella, what are you up to? Why did you say the child wasn't Matthew's? Do you know what you've missed out on? This is the Landon family we're talking about. I really don't know what you're thinking, wasting such a good opportunity."

Nina grabbed Isabella's hand and asked, "Bella, what's going on?"

Isabella said, "I was with Matthew, but we broke up a long time ago. What I said is the truth."

"Then tell us, what's the deal with this child?"

"This child is mine alone!"

"Yours alone?" Charlie chuckled. "You, a girl, got yourself pregnant?"

Isabella remained silent, biting her lip.

Vanessa stood nearby, feeling both nervous and scared as she saw Isabella's tight-lipped expression.

She had initially thought that if Isabella married Matthew, the truth about the child would never be known. But now that the situation had turned out like this, she was truly worried.

Nothing in this world can remain without a trace, especially considering Sebastian's feelings for Isabella. They worked in the same company, in the same office, and saw each other every day. Vanessa was truly afraid that if Sebastian know the truth about the child, she would be in trouble.

"Speak up!" Charlie shouted.

"What are you doing?" Nina hurried to protect Isabella. "I believe Bella. If she doesn't want to talk, she doesn't have to. Let's go home."

With that, she tried to lead Isabella towards the car.

But the car door didn't budge. Nina turned to Charlie. "Unlock the car."

Charlie sneered. "Everything's messed up, and you still want a ride in my car? Do you know that I lost a million-dollar contract because of her?"

Nina had no idea what was going on. "What do you mean?"

Isabella calmly said, "Charlie Wilson, I don't know what agreement you reached with Matthew, but Matthew and I will never be together. You better find another way out soon!"

"Another way out?" Charlie gritted his teeth. "I found a way out, but you've blocked it. I'm really fed up with you. You're a jinx. You keep dragging me down!"

"Charlie Wilson!" Nina's eyes reddened as she scolded, "What are you saying?"

"Isabella Miller, if I don't succeed, neither you nor your sister will escape!" He got into the car after threatening them.

Once inside, he yelled at Nina, "What are you standing there for? Is being burdened by her not enough? Aren't you getting in the car?"

Nina was frustrated. "You go ahead. I'm not going back today!"

"You said it!" Charlie started the car. "Don't ever come back!"

With that, he stepped on the gas and drove off.

"Sis."

"Don't worry about me. I'll stay with you today." Nina's eyes were red, tears were almost falling.

Sebastian sat in the car, watching Charlie's car drive out with only Charlie inside and no one else.

He furrowed his brow and called Jack.

"Hello, Mr. Landon."

"How is the lunch appointment with Mr. Williams this afternoon?"

Jack was puzzled. "Mr. Landon, when did you say you wanted to have lunch with Mr. Williams this afternoon?"

"I just did."

Jack hesitated, feeling that Mr. Landon had been increasingly moody lately. "I'll arrange it right away."

"This collaboration was discussed with Isabella, so bring her along."

"Understood, Mr. Landon."

After hanging up, Jack immediately called Isabella.

At that moment, Isabella and Nina had just walked out of the villa area.

"Hello, Jack?"

"Isabella, do you have time this afternoon?"

"Yes. What's up?"

"Well, we have a lunch appointment with Mr. Williams this afternoon. If you're free, come along. After all, this deal will directly affect your year-end bonus."

Isabella wanted to make an excuse, as she wasn't in the mood for socializing right now. But Jack's words cut off her thoughts. "Okay."

"Sis, I'm heading back to the office. I have a social engagement this afternoon." Isabella held Nina's hand, looking at Nina's teary eyes uneasily, "Don't quarrel with your husband because of me."

Nina and Charlie needed to live their days well, and Isabella didn't want to interfere.

"Bella, are you really not going to tell me about the child?" Nina asked.

Isabella lowered her head. "It was an accident."

"Who's the child's father, does he know?"

Isabella shook her head. "He doesn't know, and I don't plan on telling him."

"It really isn't Matthew?"

"It's not him."

Nina was still worried. "What are you going to do now? Are you really going to have the child?"

Isabella hesitated. "I don't know."

She had initially wanted to keep the child, but there were too many uncertainties, especially with what happened with Miley and Thomas. She was truly afraid that if her child was born, they would face a similar situation.

Nina held her hand and said, "I'll support you whatever decision you make. But Bella, you know that bringing the child into this world won't bring them happiness, so not having the child could also be a kindness."

Isabella's eyelashes trembled.

Nina was always the one who understood her the best.

She was moved with just a few words.

Isabella and Nina had been bullied because they had lost their parents at a young age. It had been tough for them to grow up together. They had been lucky since they had not developed any psychological scars.

She had been drawn to Matthew precisely because she was someone who lacked warmth and craved love deep down. She had hoped that his light could shine on her.

Isabella truly didn't have the ability to provide the child with a happy and complete family. If the child was born, they might face the same bullying she did.

If that was the case, she truly believed it would be better not to have the child.

"Sis, I understand. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now. I need some time to think."

"Okay." Nina let go of her hand, patting her shoulder. "Take your time to think. Don't be afraid. At least you have me."

"Sis." Isabella was exhausted.

She had been on edge since becoming pregnant. Now, she felt completely relaxed. She dropped the disguise finally, feeling physically and mentally drained, unable to help but bury herself in Nina's embrace, seeking warmth.

Sebastian watched the scene from his car nearby, feeling a tug at his heart.
###chapter 86 Brother Richard Changed

Isabella was holding Nina when a familiar car came into view.

Â 

When the car window rolled down, only to see Sebastian sat inside, looking at her. "Mr. Williams is ready. It's time to go."

Â 

"Mr. Landon?" Isabella was surprised. "Didn't you leave already?"

Â 

"Just passing by," Sebastian brushed it off. "Get in. We can't park here for long."

Â 

Isabella hesitated for a moment. "Okay."

Â 

After the car drove off, Nina stood on the roadside, wiping away tears.Â She took a moment, then started walking along the sidewalk, planning to find a bus stop and take bus back.

Â 

At the entrance of the villa area, a car slowly drove out.

Â 

"Brother Richard, it's that lady," Michael exclaimed excitedly.

Â 

In the back seat, Richard looked towards the roadside, his deep gaze capturing Nina's figure walking along.

Â 

"This lady lives in Green Valley Community. Why is she here?" Michael was full of gossip.

Â 

"Drive, stop gossiping,"Â said Richard.

Â 

"Okay." Michael cautiously checked the rearview mirror.Â "Should we go say hello?"

Â 

Richard gave him a displeased look. "Say one more word, and I'll kick you out of the car."

Â 

Michael finally shut up.Â But he didn't drive away, just slowly followingÂ behind Nina at a distance.

Â 

Richard glanced at the documents in his hand for a moment, then looked out the window. His gaze fell on Nina, who seemed lost in thought. She didn't even seem to notice the car behind her.

Â 

"Is sheÂ deaf? The horn is almost in her face, and she doesn't react?Â Is she old and hard of hearing?Â Is she planning to walk back? It's over twenty miles from here to Green Valley Community!Â This area is all upscale, with no bus stops or subway stations nearby. SheÂ is really tough."Â Michael kept on chattering.

Â 

Richard finally kicked the seat in annoyance, "Drive over there."

Â 

Michael rubbed his nose, chuckling. "Brother Richard, you said you weren't interested in her?"

Richard gave Michael a sideways glance.

Â 

Michael was about to step on the gas to catch up, but he was too late.

Â 

Â 

Another car had already slowly stopped by the roadside, blocking Nina's figure.Â And about a minute later, Nina got into that car and drove away.

Â 

"Oh man! We missed our chance." Michael couldn't help but tease Richard.Â "Just one step short, just one step. Man, Brother Richard, you're usually so decisive, why do you get all sappy around this lady?"

Â 

A minute later, Michael was kicked out of the car.Â Then the car sped away.

Â 

Michael got up from the ground, dusted off his clothes, and grinned.Â "Brother Richard, you're finally ready to make a change."

Â 

The car Nina got into was Zoe and Vanessa's.

Â 

"Nina, where do you live? I'll have the driver take you back." Zoe felt guilty in front of Nina after what happened.

Â 

After all, it was ultimately Matthew's fault.

Â 

"No need, Mr. Zoe. Just drop me off at the bus stop. I'll take the bus back,"Â said Nina.

Â 

"How can that be okay?" Zoe thought for a moment.Â "I remember you came with your husband. Where is he? Did he leave you stranded on the street? There isn't even a bus stop around here."

Â 

When Charlie was mentioned, Nina felt awkward.Â She didn't want to say much to outsiders, so she just said, "He had some urgent matters at work, so I let him go first."

Â 

Zoe, who had lived for most of her life, could see through things easily. Although Nina said so, she could tell that Charlie wasn't treating her well.

Â 

After a moment of contemplation, sheÂ realized that the couple mightÂ have a conflictÂ after today's events.

Â 

Sending Nina back now might lead to an argument between them.

Â 

After some thought, Zoe said, "Nina, I have an awkward request. I don't know if you can agree."

Â 

"Go ahead,"Â Nina said.

Â 

"I have a picky palate. Sebastian brought in a few nutritionists,Â butÂ the food they made didn't suit my taste. When I saw you today, I remembered the meals you made. If you're free, could you come to my house and cook a simple dinner for me? Just a few home-cooked dishes would be enough to satisfy myÂ cravings."Â Zoe's request was sincere.

Â 

However,Â Nina glanced at Vanessa. "Is that convenient?"

Â 

Before Vanessa could speak, Zoe interjected, "It's fine. There's nothing inconvenient as long as you agree."

Â 

"Okay." Nina thought about it. It was meaninglessÂ going back now, so she agreed.

Â 

Night fell in the blink of an eye.

Â 

Isabella and Mr. Williams finished dinner and came out. It was already dark outside.

Â 

Mr. Williams had some drinks, and Jack was responsible for taking him back.

Â 

Sebastian also had some drinks, so driving naturally fell to Isabella.

Â 

Isabella drove, with Sebastian sitting in the passenger seat, half asleep. The night breeze seeped in through the window, bringing a chill. After a few seconds, large raindrops started pelting in from outside. The rain came down hard and fast as if someone were pouring water from a bucket, and within moments, Isabella's arm was soaked.

Â 

Anxious to close the window, Isabella pressed a button on the unfamiliar car, causing the entire dashboard to light up.

Â 

"Press the green button." Suddenly, Sebastian's voice sounded.Â When Isabella turned around, she saw him approaching.

Â 

"Ahh!" In her panic, Isabella wasn't even sure what she did.

Â 

Crash!

Â 

The car veered sharply to the left, shooting off the asphalt and plowing through the lawn before coming to a halt after hitting a large tree.

Â 

Moments later, white smoke billowed from under the hood.

Â 

Isabella gripped the steering wheel tightly, still in shock.

Â 

Sebastian remained calm, patting her shoulder.Â "See if it can still start."

Â 

Isabella was too stunned to react for several seconds before trying to start the car a few times but to no avail.

Â 

The rain outside grew heavier, the sound of raindrops hitting the roof becoming louder.

Â 

Sebastian took off his coat.Â "I'll go check outside."

Â 

Before Isabella could react, he had already opened the car door and walked around to the front to inspect.

Â 

It was pitch black outside, and the car's headlights had been knocked out. Worried, Isabella turned on her phone's flashlight andÂ alsoÂ got out of the car.

Â 

She walked over and stood behind Sebastian, using her phone to light the way.

Â 

Sebastian was taken aback.Â "Why did you get out?"

Â 

Without answering, Isabella asked him, "How is it?"

Â 

"It's stuck. We need to call a tow truck." Sebastian stood up. "Wait in the car."

Â 

 ###chapter 87 Let Me Hug You

After getting into the car, Sebastian called for a tow truck.

Â 

OnceÂ he hung up,Â Isabella asked, "What did they say?"

Â 

"It's a bit far.Â It will take at least forty minutes to get here," Sebastian said, turning to look at her, then frowned.

Â 

The light inside the car was on, and Isabella was soaked through, water dripping from her hair. She had worn a white T-shirt under a plaid shirt jacket, both now drenched, making her look thoroughly bedraggled.

Â 

Sebastian took out a dry towel from the storage compartment and handed it to her.Â "Dry yourself off. Don't catch a cold."

Â 

"Thank you, Mr. Landon." Isabella hesitated for a moment and took it.Â She wiped her hair with the towel while Sebastian kept looking at his phone.

Â 

The wet shirt jacket sticking to her body was uncomfortable, so Isabella took it off, leaving her in a thin white T-shirt.

Â 

Suddenly, Sebastian sneezed.

Â 

Isabella turned to look atÂ Sebastian, whoÂ had been out of the car longer than her, soÂ he was more severely wet.

Â 

After wiping herself a few times, Isabella wrung out the towel and offered it to him, saying,Â "Mr. Landon, you should dry off too."

Â 

Only then did Sebastian look up at her.Â "I'm fine."

Â 

Feeling guilty since it was she who had driven the car off the road and caused them both to be stranded, Isabella couldn't bear the thought of Sebastian catching cold because of her.

Â 

Seeing that Sebastian wouldn't take the towel and water was still dripping from his cheeks, Isabella steeled herself and directly started to wipe his face for him.

Â 

The momentÂ whenÂ the towel touched Sebastian's face, both of them froze.

Â 

Especially Sebastian, whose pupils contracted as if fireworks burst momentarily.

Â 

Isabella felt something was wrong as she wiped.Â Sebastian's gaze towards her was off, very off!

Â 

She wanted to pull her hand back, but it was too late.

Â 

Sebastian suddenly grabbed her wrist, his another hand came to support her waist, effortlessly lifting her and laying her across his lap.

Â 

"Mr. Landon!" Isabella exclaimed, trying to get up. But in the confined space of the car, she hit her head on the ceiling as she tried to sit up, which left her dazed.

Â 

Sebastian raised his hand to rub her head gently, pressing his whole body against hers.Â "Isabella, don't move. Just let me hold you for a while."

Â 

This was something he had wanted to do for a long time, but he usually restrained himself.

Â 

Perhaps the current atmosphere was too tempting, and he couldn't control himself, so he acted.

Â 

Isabella turned to look at Sebastian in surprise, thinking he was out of his mind.Â So sheÂ reminded him, "Mr. Landon, I'm Isabella."

Â 

Sebastian stared at her intently. "I know. Isabella."

Â 

Sebastian's large hand was already on her lower abdomen, gently and firmly caressing her skin through the thin fabric.

Â 

Isabella trembled all over, pressing his hand, her voice trembling.Â "Mr. Landon."

Â 

Little did she know that her voice was even more alluring to Sebastian.

Â 

He had only wanted to hug IsabellaÂ andÂ touch her subtly.Â But now the desire grew stronger, and he was no longer satisfied with just that.

Â 

"Isabella." Sebastian cleared his throat, staring at Isabella's pink lips, his breathing becoming difficult.

Â 

The atmosphere in the car seemed to ignite, and Isabella felt her once cold heart warming up.

Â 

She had no resistance to Sebastian's teasing, but she still maintained a bit of rationality. SheÂ softly pleaded with tears, "Mr. Landon, I'm Isabella.Â I'm Isabella..."

Â 

Isabella's pleas fell on Sebastian's ears, but instead of calming him, they acted as a catalyst.

Â 

Sebastian's rationality was shattered, he held her chin and kissed her recklessly.

Â 

In the Landon family, Nina was busy in the kitchen for a while, and several delicious home-cooked dishes were served on the table.

Â 

Zoe took a few bites and immediately smiled.Â "It was delicious.Â Vanessa, do you want to try?"

Â 

"Sure, Grandma always talks about it.Â I also want to taste Ms. Miller's cooking," Vanessa said, using a fork to taste a few dishes.

Â 

In fact, the dishes looked decent, but they were just home-cooked dishes.Â She could make them too. But Zoe always said Nina's cooking was excellent, so Vanessa was curious to see what the fuss was about.

Â 

"How is it?Â Isn't it delicious?" Zoe eagerly awaited Vanessa's praise.

Â 

Vanessa smiled and gave a somewhat insincere compliment.Â "It's pretty good."

Â 

But compared to these home-cooked dishes, Vanessa preferred high-end Western cuisine and desserts. Nina's cooking skills were clearly honed from years of being a housewife, a role that nowadays lacked status and presence in society. Knowing how to cook a few simple stir-fries hardly counts as an impressive skill.

Â 

But Zoe loved it. Although Zoe wasÂ picky, she unexpectedly ate many of them, drank two bowls of soup, and still wanted a third bowl.

Â 

Vanessa stopped her.Â "Grandma, you've eaten enough tonight.Â You can't eat anymore."

Â 

Zoe pouted, looking quite unhappy, "I want just a little more. The food tonight is just to my taste."

Â 

"No!" Vanessa directly took away her utensils.Â "You forgot what the doctor saidÂ thatÂ your stomach isn't good.Â Eating too much for dinner is not easy to digestÂ and you might get sick."

Â 

Zoe, who was in a good mood, was suddenly stopped.Â HerÂ displeasure was evident on her face.

Â 

Seeing this, Vanessa felt a bit awkward.

Â 

Nina didn't want them to be unhappy over a meal, so she smiled and intervened, "Ms. Field is right.Â She's just thinking about your health. You've eaten quite a lot tonight."

Â 

"But it's because your cooking is so good. Ever since you brought me food last time, I haven't had a proper meal. Finally, I had a good appetite tonight and wanted to eat more, but I was stopped. I'm not full yet,"Â said Zoe.

Â 

Nina glanced at Vanessa in distress and said, "If you ever want to eat my cooking again, you canÂ give me a call and I'll come over to cook for you."

Â 

Zoe was delighted.Â "Really?"

Â 

"Yes,"Â Nina replied.

Â 

"Will it interfere with your work?"Â asked Zoe.

Â 

"I don't have a job.Â I'm just at home every day, feeling quite bored."

Â 

ZoeÂ said, "Well, that's great. I'll fire the nutritionist at home and hire you to cook for me."

Â 

'Zoe really does whatever she wants.'Â Vanessa, standing beside them, was wide-eyed.Â She asked, "Isn't that bad?"

Â 

Zoe tugged at Nina'sÂ sleeve and whispered, "Do you know how much a nutritionist makesÂ per month?"

Â 

Nina shook her head.

Â 

Zoe held out a finger and gestured to her.

Â 

"A thousandÂ dollars?"Â asked Nina.

Â 

Zoe chuckled.Â "It's ten thousandÂ dollars."

Â 

"Ten thousandÂ dollars!" Nina was shocked by this number.Â 'Being a nutritionist is so lucrative!'

Â 

###chapter 88 Tracked

To be honest, upon hearing this number, Nina couldn't help but feel excited.

Â 

She used to leave early and return late for work, and the most she could earn in a month was just over four thousand dollars. During slow business periods, she sometimes only made a thousandÂ dollars, barely making ends meet.

Â 

Although Nina didn't earn much, she felt secure with money in her pocket.

Â 

This sense of security disappeared as soon as she stopped working.

Â 

Charlie didn't contribute any income.Â For the past few months, all the household expenses were covered by her money. Seeing only outflow and no inflow, she felt increasingly insecure.

Â 

Now, with such a high-paying job opportunity in front of her, it was hard for Nina not to be moved.

Â 

Seeing Nina's reaction, Zoe seized the opportunity.Â "Are you willing to come?"

Â 

Vanessa interjected, "Grandma, please don't make it difficult for Ms. Miller. After all, she has a family and a husband. How could she come so far every day to cook for you? If you don't like the current nutritionist, I can find another one for you."

Â 

Having one Isabella was already enough to give Vanessa headaches; if Nina were added to the mix, she couldn't even imagine what life would be like.

Â 

After a moment of thought, Zoe said, "That's not a problem. I'll have a light breakfast.Â Nina, you can come over after finishing your morning chores. You'll be in charge of lunch and dinner. As for transportation,Â I'll have a driver pick you up, ensuringÂ yourÂ safety. Does that work for you?"

Â 

Nina was touched by Zoe's kindness. She wasn't naive and could see that Zoe didn't lack nutritionists; Zoe simply enjoyed her cooking. Moreover, Zoe had noticed her financial difficulties and wanted to help her out.

Â 

"Grandma, Ms. Miller only knows how to cook some home-style dishes. I'm worried about the nutritional value," Vanessa interjected.

Â 

"In our younger days, we ate worse than this. As long as the meat and vegetables are balanced, there shouldn't be a problem with nutrition," Zoe interrupted Vanessa, indicating that she was about to have Nina come over to cook for her.

Â 

After some thought, Nina said, "I need to discuss this with my husband ."

Â 

"Sure," Zoe nodded.Â "There should be discussions between spouses. Go talk to him, and I'll wait for your message."

Â 

"Okay,"Â said Nina.

Â 

After the meal, Zoe had the driver take Nina back.

Â 

Feeling like she had already troubled others enough, Nina declined the offer of a ride and walked out of the villa area, using a mobile app to call a car.

Â 

Just as she stepped out and stood by the roadside for less than a minute, a car approached slowly, signaling and pulling over.

Â 

Nina checked the license plate, opened the door, and got in.

Â 

The driver in front asked, "Did you call a car?"

Â 

His voice was deep, and Nina found it somewhat familiar. She replied, looking ahead.

Â 

The car interior was dim, with only the streetlights casting a faint glow through the windows. The driver wore a black mask and cap, and even his clothes were black. His gloved hands on the steering wheel were also black.

Â 

Noticing Nina's gaze, the driver lifted his eyes slightly.Â Their eyes briefly met in the rearview mirror. The piercing gaze sent a shiver down Nina's spine.

Â 

She blurted out, "Have we met somewhere before?"

Â 

Richard, with his mask onÂ and his expression hidden, but Nina felt a hint of disdain in his eyes and ice tone.Â "We haven't."

Â 

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Nina said, "Sorry, for a moment your voice sounded familiar."

Â 

Richard glanced at her again and asked, "Where to?"

Â 

"Green Valley Community."Â Nina didn't think much of it, leaning back in her seat, and looking out the window at the passing scenery.Â She was torn about whether to tell Isabella the matter of being a nutritionist for the London family.

Â 

By the time they reached Green Valley Community, Nina had fallen asleep in the back seat.

Â 

Richard turned off the car, opened the window, lit a cigarette, and smoked leisurely. His gaze, however, remained fixed on Nina's face in the rearview mirror, deep and pensive, his thoughts inscrutable.

Â 

Suddenly, a hurried ringtone broke the silence. Richard took out his phone, and immediately switched it to silent mode, but still woke Nina up.

Â 

"Are we there?" Nina rubbed her eyes, unaware of any issues, grabbed her bag, and got out of the car. "Thank you, sir."

Â 

Leaning on the car window, Richard watched Nina walk into the dimly lit corridor.Â He took a final drag of his cigarette, extinguished it, and then got out of the car.

Â 

Just as Nina reached her doorstep, her phone rang.Â "Your order has timed out and has been canceled."

Â 

'The order hasÂ timed out?'Â She was confused.Â SheÂ opened the ride-hailing app. To her horror, she felt her blood run cold.

Â 

The car she had just taken had been canceled, so who had just brought her back?

Â 

She checked the details page, carefully examining the license plate number several times, feeling a moment of confusion.Â She had misread the license plate number.

Â 

She had misread the license plate number "YI2625" as "Y12625".Â One was the letter "i", the other was the number "Â 1".

Â 

The mistake was too absurd!

Â 

Nina then remembered Richard's gaze earlier, which seemed familiar.

Â 

A fierce face flashed through Nina's mind.Â She broke out in a cold sweat. 'Was it him??'

Â 

It was the Richard who had almost hit her last time, then brought her home and left the medicine hanging on the doorknob.

Â 

Nina's hair stood on end, and suddenly she heard footsteps behind her, rapidly approaching.

Â 

Quickly grabbing a broom leaning against the door, as the person approached, NinaÂ turned around and began to wildly strikeÂ that personÂ with the broom, shouting frantically.

Â 

The person being hit also shouted, dodging while grabbing the broom, "Nina, what are you doing?"

Â 

Nina, coming back to her senses from the frenzy, stared wide-eyed.Â "Charlie, is that you?"

Â 

Charlie, unkindlyÂ dropped the broom heavily on the ground.Â "If it's not me, then who else could it be?"

Â 

The corridor was brightly lit, casting a pale reflection on Nina's face. Overcome with fear, her legs went weak, and she almost lost her balance, stumbling to the side and bumping into Charlie.

Â 

Charlie immediately gave her a disdainful look and asked, "What are you doing, trying to give someone a heart attack?"

Â 

Glancing at the pitch-black hallway, although she couldn't see anything, she felt as if there were eyes staring at her. That eerie feeling crept up on her again, and she grabbed Charlie's arm, her voice trembling.Â "Charlie, I think I'm being followed."

Â 

Charlie was opening the door, and her sudden movement made him impatient.Â So heÂ shook off her hand.Â "What nonsense are you talking about? Who would follow a married woman like you?"

Â 

He walked inside after opening the door and, seeing Nina still standing there staring at the entrance to the stairwell, frowned impatiently and said, "Are you coming in or not? If not, I'm closing the door."

Â 

Nina had to avert her gaze and enter the house.

Â 

Â 

###chapter 89 Self-Deprecation

After locking the door, the temperature inside the house calmed Nina's heart a bit.

Â 

Charlie had changed his shoes and walked into the living room. Nina noticed his legÂ and asked, "What happened to your leg?"

Â 

"Don't mention it." Charlie sat on the sofa, lifted his foot, and placed it on the coffee table. "I got bumped downstairs just now and fell into a flowerbed. I've twisted my ankle. Hurry up and come take a look, grab a bottle of topical ointment, and rub it in for me. It's killing me!"

Â 

Nina took the ointment and squatted down to massage Charlie's ankle.

Â 

"Where did you go this afternoon?" Charlie asked, "Why are you only back now?"

Â 

Nina then mentioned her visit to the Landon family, where Zoe invited her to work as a nutritionist.

Â 

Before she could finish, Charlie interjected, "Go.Â Ten thousand dollars a month, plus a private car service, why wouldn't you go?"

Â 

"Did you agree to it?"Â asked Nina.

Â 

"What's there to disagree about? It's ten thousand dollars, who wouldn't go for the money?"Â sad Charlie.

Â 

Nina knew that Charlie was as money-obsessed as she was; after all, they were both from the working class and understood the importance of money. But hearing him say this still made her feel a bit uncomfortable. "Didn't you say before that I should stay at home and focus on preparing for pregnancy because I'm in poor health?"

Â 

Charlie waved his hand.Â "Preparing for pregnancy and working as a nutritionist at the Landon family are two different things.Â They don't conflict."

Â 

"Do I need to inform Bella about this? After all, Sebastian is her boss. Going to his house as a nutritionist might cause her some trouble."Â Nina had some concerns.

Â 

"Are you crazy? What's there to tell her about this kind of thing? Can she offer you ten thousand dollars a month?" Charlie stared, "What trouble could there be? You do your thing, and she does hers."

Â 

Nina fell silent.Â Deep down, she still felt like she should tell Isabella about this.

Â 

Seemingly understanding Nina's thoughts, Charlie threatened, "Let me tell you, there is no need to disclose everything to Isabella. If she really cared about us, she wouldn't have let us go to the Landon family and endure such humiliation for no reason."

Â 

Nina frowned.Â "That was your decision to go."

Â 

"I went for her sake, thinking she could marry into wealth and have a worry-free life for the rest of her days. Who knew she would be so foolish, giving up a good life just like that, and causing me to lose my contract too." Charlie ranted, "I'm telling you, I'm not done with her over this."

Â 

Seeing Charlie so angry, Nina compromised.Â "Okay, I'll listen to you.Â I won't tell her for now."

Â 

"Not just for now, never tell her anything again." Charlie rolled his eyes.Â "What a mess!"

Â 

At that moment, Isabella and Sebastian were still trapped in the car.

Â 

Half an hour had passed, but the rescue team had yet to arrive.

Â 

Isabella curled up in Sebastian's arms, feeling that time had never been so long and unbearable in her life.

Â 

Her heart was beating fast. Her mind was still fuzzy, and the thought of Sebastian pressing and kissing her moments ago made her hair stand on end.

Â 

Not only her, but Sebastian's heart was also pounding intensely. Both of them were drenched, yet they could still feel each other's warmth.

Â 

A beam of light shone down as the rescue team arrived.

Â 

Sebastian reached out, pulled down Isabella's dress, then opened the car door and carried her out.

Â 

The rain was still pouring outside. Isabella wanted to get down and walk, but Sebastian didn't give her the chance. He carried her straight into the rescue vehicle that had come to pick them up.

Â 

After placing her in a seat, Sebastian went back.

Â 

When he returned, he had two more bags in his hands.

Â 

From one of the bags, heÂ took out a scarf and wrapped it around Isabella.

Â 

Isabella recognized it as the first scarf Sebastian had given her as compensation. She had initially refused it.

Â 

Unexpectedly, Sebastian had kept it and even stored it in the trunk all this time.

Â 

The other bag contained a set of skincare products for pregnant women.Â "This was originally meant for you. Since you guessed it was from me, don't return it."

Â 

Isabella's heart raced.Â "Mr. Landon."

Â 

"Still calling me Mr. Landon?" Sebastian reached out and caressed her cheek, his eyes burning.Â "After kissing and touching, you think I can't bear this responsibility?"

Â 

Isabella was completely bewildered. Wrapped in the scarf, she looked like a wounded kitten, gazing at him with watery eyes.Â "Mr. Landon, what do you mean?"

Â 

"Literal meaning." Sebastian ran his fingers through her hair.Â "Don't burden yourself mentally. Since I've done it, I'll take responsibility."

Â 

"What about Vanessa?" Isabella asked.

Â 

Sebastian furrowed his brow, "I'll handle her."

Â 

The car started.

Â 

Sebastian reached out to touch Isabella's hair, hooked his arm around her shoulder, and pulled her into his embrace.

Â 

Isabella stiffened, then pushed him away, saying firmly, "Mr. Landon, I have a child."

Â 

"You still want to marry Matthew Landon?" Sebastian frowned.

Â 

Isabella felt a pang in her heart.Â Not becauseÂ he mentionedÂ Matthew, but because she was lying to Sebastian at that moment.Â "After all, he is the child's father."

Â 

Sebastian stared at her for a few seconds, then burst out laughing in frustration.Â "Isabella Miller, what should I say about you?"

Â 

'Stubborn as a mule.'Â Sebastian wanted to scold her, but he couldn't bring himself to say a word of reproach to her.

Â 

Isabella looked at her knees and spoke words that went against her heart.Â "Unless Mr. Landon can accept it."

Â 

"Accept what?"Â Sebastian asked.

Â 

Isabella paused, met his gaze, and said, "Accept being a stepfather."

Â 

"Isabella Miller!" Sebastian's face darkened for a moment.Â "I can accept you having a child with someone else, except for Matthew Landon."

Â 

Emma and Matthew were already enough for Sebastian to handle. He wouldn't even think about letting Matthew's child call him dad in the future.

Â 

Isabella nodded slightly, her voice soft.Â "Then there's nothing more to say."

Â 

Sebastian gritted his teeth.Â "At this point, are you still willing to have the child?"

Â 

"Yes." Isabella was stubborn.Â "After all, he is a life."

Â 

Sebastian turned his head in frustration, refusing to look at her.Â After a while, his deep voice came. "Never belittle yourself at any time."

Â 

Isabella's heart clenched. She bit her lip heavily, and remained silent with her head bowed.

Â 

She and Sebastian were destined to be like this.

Â 

No matter what, Isabella couldn't ruin Sebastian and Vanessa's engagement.

Â 

The first time was an accident; she couldn't control it. Moreover, at that time, she wasn't aware of the relationship between Vanessa and Sebastian.

Â 

It was a mistake, but indeed an unintentional one, which she could somewhat justify to her conscience.

Â 

If she were to make the same mistake again, she would truly be devaluing and degrading herself without any bottom line.

Â 

When the car arrived at her dormitory building, Isabella got out, and Sebastian didn't immediately leave but sat in the car, quietly watching her go upstairs.

Â 

It wasn't until Isabella entered the dormitory that she heard the engine start, the sound fading away.

Â 

In truth, Sebastian was a genuinely good man. Despite his cold demeanor, he was warmer and more considerate than Matthew. Even when angry, he wouldn't abandon her and leave, nor would he throw a tantrum.

Â 

HeÂ wasÂ indeed a man of great character.

Â 

Isabella's fingers caressed her abdomen as she murmured, "Baby, if he didn't have Vanessa, maybe I could have accepted my mistake. But now, baby, don't blame me. I really can't give you a good life, and I'm afraid you'll end up like those children in the orphanage, so I can only..."

Â 

SheÂ closed her eyes, unable to speak the rest of her thoughts, letting the tears fall silently.

###chapter 90 Surgery

The next day was Sunday, the day Isabella went for her check-up.

Â 

Seeing that it was still early, she decided to visit Miley on the way.

Â 

Just as she was about to push the door open, someone came out from inside, almost colliding with her.

Â 

When Isabella looked closely, she was somewhat surprised.Â "Mr. Jose?"

Â 

Seeing Zaire here, Isabella was both surprised and somehow found it reasonable. She had heard Miley mention that Zaire was the largest shareholder of Moon Club.Â Since Miley worked at Moon Club, in a sense, Zaire was Miley's boss.

Â 

Zaire's phone kept ringing.Â He gestured towards it, indicating he needed to take the call.

Â 

Isabella stepped aside to let him out.Â Once he was far enough, she knocked on the door and entered the hospital room.

Â 

Miley was sitting on the hospital bed, her complexion looking rosier, but her eyes were slightly red as if she had been crying.

Â 

"Are you feeling any better?" Isabella placed the fruits on the bedside table and asked.

Â 

Miley nodded.Â "Much better. What brings you here so early in the morning?"

Â 

"I have a check-up today." Isabella paused and said, "I'm planning to terminate this pregnancyÂ like you before. But I'm a bit nervousÂ and wanted to ask if there's anything I need to prepare for, whether the surgery is done under general anesthesia, if it's painful, roughly how much it costs, and if my family needs to sign anything during the procedure."

Â 

Miley was taken aback for a moment, her gaze scanning Isabella's belly. She said,Â "Are you considering terminating the pregnancy because of Samantha's situation?"

Â 

Yesterday evening, Samantha posted a status, happily announcing to everyone that she had reconciled with Matthew and even shared a pregnancy test report.

Â 

Now, the entire Harvar University knew that Matthew was a scoundrel. Not only was his ex-girlfriend Isabella pregnant, but his current girlfriend Samantha was also expecting.

Â 

This dramatic turn of events could fill two hundred episodes of a TV drama.

Â 

Isabella shook her head.Â "It has nothing to do with them. I didn't know I was pregnant, and I took medication and injections during this time. I've thought about it for a long time, and I need to be Â responsible for the child."

Â 

Miley nodded in understanding.Â "I see. But have you really thought it through?"

Â 

"I have,"Â said Isabella.

Â 

Ten minutes later, Zaire returned after finishing his call.

Â 

As Isabella stood up to leave, Zaire walked over and asked, "Are you going to leave?"

Â 

"Yes." Isabella politely nodded at him.Â "Goodbye, Mr. Jose. Bye, Miley."

Â 

"Bye." Miley waved at her with a smile on her face.

Â 

As Isabella left, Zaire's face came into Miley's view.Â Her smile instantly faded.

Â 

Zaire chuckled.Â "You smile so sweetly at Isabella, how about a smile for me?"

Â 

"I can't bring myself to smile at you."Â Miley lay down, turned her back, and muttered softly, "Men are all the same."

Â 

Zaire raised his hand to his forehead.Â "Why am I being dragged into this again? I just managed to make you feel better a moment ago. Did Isabella say something to you?"

Â 

"What can Isabella tell me?" Miley couldn't help but defend Isabella.Â "It's you men who only care about enjoying yourselves but don't care about the consequences."

Â 

Bending down, Zaire's large hand slipped under the blanket.Â "Alright, I'll take care of you now."

Â 

He was skillful, and in no time, Miley was breathless and completely yielding.

Â 

Zaire took off his coat, got up, and pressed her down on the bed to kiss her.

Â 

Miley pushed him away.Â "This is a hospital."

Â 

"What's there to be afraid of?" Zaire smirked, pulling open her hospital gown.Â "This is more exciting."

Â 

"But I just had surgery,"Â said Miley.

Â 

Zaire's breath was heavy.Â "I'll just kiss you, nothing more."

Â 

Later on...

Â 

Zaire asked, "You seem to get along well with Isabella.Â She came to the hospital so early to see you."

Â 

Miley leaned against him, her long hair cascading down.Â "She's here for surgery."

Â 

"What surgery?"Â asked Zaire.

Â 

"Similar to mine." Miley's eyes flickered slightly, and the corners of her eyes became a bit moist. After a while, she murmured, "Neither of us is a good mother."

Â 

"Abortion surgery?" Zaire picked up his phone and sent a text to Sebastian.

Â 

"Have you made up your mind?" the doctor asked.

Â 

Isabella nodded.Â "Yes."

Â 

"Alright, then I'll schedule the surgery for you,"Â said the doctor.

Â 

Isabella asked urgently, "Can it be done today?"

Â 

The doctor was surprised.Â "Why the rush?"

Â 

"I don't want to stay in the hospital after the surgery. I have to work tomorrow,"Â said Isabella.

Â 

The doctor frowned at her words.Â "Although it's a minor surgery, post-operative rest and care are crucial. Young lady, what's more important to you, work or your health?"

Â 

Isabella hesitated for a moment and replied, "For me, work is more important."

Â 

The doctor sighed and shook his head, commenting, "I've seen too many young ladies like you, who consider themselves young and neglect their health. When they grow older, they'll suffer for it."

Â 

Despite saying that, the doctor still gave her a series of instructions,Â such as avoiding drafts, not touching cold water for at least half a month, keeping her feet warm, and refraining from consuming cold drinks.

Â 

Isabella was deeply moved and noted everything down.

Â 

The surgery was scheduled for three hours later. During this time, Isabella completed all the preoperative examinations and then went to wait outside the designated operating room.

Â 

A nurse handed her a set of surgical clothes and pointed to the nearby changing room.Â "You can change in there."

Â 

"Thank you." Isabella took the clothes and headed towards the changing room.

Â 

Suddenly, out of the corner of her eye, she saw a figure approaching. Before Isabella could react, a large hand reached out, grabbed her arm, and pulled her over.

Â 

Isabella bumped into the person and turned in surprise.Â "Mr. Landon?"

Â 

She must be hallucinating, seeing Sebastian there.

Â 

Sebastian glanced at the surgical clothes in her handÂ with a cold expression.Â "What are you up to?"

Â 

Isabella was taken aback, her arm soreÂ because ofÂ Sebastian's grip. She could feel that Sebastian was angry at this moment. The pain brought her back to realityÂ andÂ this wasn't a dream but real life.

Â 

Sebastian seemed impatient to hear her explanation, took the surgical clothes away, handed them to Jack who followed, and then dragged Isabella into the elevator.

Â 

It wasn't until the elevator doors closed that Isabella realized.Â "Mr. Landon, where are you taking me?"

Â 

Sebastian looked at her.Â "Taking you to wake up."

Â 

The elevator descended about three or four floors.Â When the doors opened, Sebastian pulled her out.

Â 

As soon as they stepped out of the elevator, Isabella heard the sound of a baby crying.

Â 

Isabella was puzzledÂ thatÂ they had arrived at the neonatal department.

Â 

Sebastian was strong, almost dragging Isabella along.Â TheyÂ finally stopped at the entrance to the nursery.

Â 

Through the glass, she could see individual baby cribs, each containing a baby. They were so small, so adorable,Â and well-behaved.Â Isabella's heart softened as she saw the scene.

Â 

###chapter 91 Outrageous Listening

"Isabella." Sebastian's voice came from beside her.Â "In life, one will face many choices. I just hopeÂ you won't regretÂ the decisions you make ."

Â 

Tears welled up in Isabella's eyes as she touched the glass, looking at the vibrant little lives inside the incubators as if seeing the child in her own belly.

Â 

To be honest, she had been looking forward to it and had considered giving birth.

Â 

But there were too many uncertainties.Â The more she thought about it, the more afraid she became, gradually losing her confidence.

Â 

"Isabella." Sebastian took a step closer to her, wanting to hug her. But he held back, his hands clenched into fists at his sides.

Â 

Isabella took a few deep breaths and turned her head.Â "Thank you, Mr. Landon."

Â 

Sebastian's actions were like a rope, pulling her back from the edge of the cliff.

Â 

Subconsciously, she didn't want to abort this child. From the moment when the doctor scheduled the surgery, she felt entangled and self-blamed.

Â 

Her sense of responsibility was too heavy.Â If she really aborted this child, she would truly regret it.

Â 

Seeing Isabella come to her decision, Sebastian's tense emotions eased slightly "I apologize for my actions and words last night. If you made this decision because of that, I feel guilty."

Â 

Isabella shook her head.Â "Don't say that. If it weren't for you, I might have already entered the operating room. When I came out of the operating room, I might really regret it."

Â 

Sebastian looked at her, his eyes filled with complexity.

Â 

He was clearly bothered by the fact that Isabella was carrying Matthew's child and would have preferred she terminate the pregnancy. Doing so would also sever the bond between her and Matthew, ensuring Isabella could never return to Matthew's side. Yet, when he learned that Isabella was undergoing the procedure at the hospital, he rushed over regardless to stop it.Â He couldn't explain the reason.

Â 

He might simply feel that Isabella really wanted this child, so he didn't want her to regret it. There might also be some unclear reasons involved.

Â 

Just the thought of Isabella aborting the child made Sebastian feel unbearable, and there was even a faint sense of heartacheÂ for him.

Â 

After leaving the hospital, Sebastian and Jack left.

Â 

This time, Sebastian didn't say anything about giving Isabella a ride.

Â 

"Mr. Landon, do we really not need to give Isabella a ride?" Jack glanced at the rearview mirror and asked.

Â 

Sebastian looked out the car window.Â "No need."

Â 

Jack asked, "Are you feeling unwell?"

Â 

Sebastian coughed.Â "Just a cold, it's nothing."

Â 

"Are we going back to the company?"

Â 

Sebastian fell silent for a moment and said, "Back home."

Â 

"Okay."Â Jack drove the car back to Azure Wave Garden. As soon as Sebastian entered the house, he smelled the aroma of food. Unlike usual, the smell was more like home-cooked food.

Â 

"Mr. Landon." Vanessa walked over.Â "I was about to call you, lunch is almost ready."

Â 

Sebastian glanced towards the dining room.Â "Did you change the nutritionist?"

Â 

"Yes." A hint of grievance appeared on Vanessa's face.Â "I hired a nutritionist for Grandma, but she didn't like it and insisted on hiring one without a certificate."

Â 

"Where did you find someone without a certificate?" Sebastian usually paid the most attention to Zoe's diet and lifestyle and spared no expense in hiring nutritionists based solely on their qualifications. That was why Vanessa went all out to hire those foreign chefs, only for Nina to end up benefiting from it.

Â 

While Vanessa and Sebastian were talking, Nina, wearing an apron, came out and exchanged a glance with Sebastian.

Â 

Nina felt a little embarrassed.Â "Mr. Landon."

Â 

"Is it you?" Sebastian was somewhat surprised. He never expected that Zoe's new nutritionist would be Nina.

Â 

"The meal is ready.Â I'll go call Zoe downstairs for dinner." Nina nodded to the two and went upstairs.

Â 

Seeing Sebastian frown in silence, Vanessa said, "I couldn't persuade Grandma. Mr. Landon, maybe you can try. Grandma will definitely listen to you."

Â 

"Persuade?" Sebastian looked indifferent.Â "Since Grandma rarely likes to eat home-cooked food, just let her stay."Â Vanessa was speechlessÂ about his response.

Â 

"I'm a bit tired.Â I won't eat." Sebastian left this sentence and went upstairs to rest.

Â 

Watching him leave, Vanessa murmured, "Mr. Landon, I know you're keeping Nina because of Isabella."

Â 

The next day, Sebastian didn't come to the company all day.

Â 

Isabella asked Jack and found out that Sebastian was sick.

Â 

Thinking back to yesterday at the hospital, Isabella felt that he didn't look quite right, and he was coughing. So heÂ probably caughtÂ a cold because ofÂ getting rained on the night before.

Â 

Ten minutes before the end of the workday, Jack suddenly shouted in the group chat, "Everyone, nowÂ come with me to Mr. Landon's house."

Â 

Everyone in the group was responding, except Isabella, who hadn't replied.

Â 

After a while, Jack went directly to her.Â "Isabella, did you see the group message?"

Â 

Isabella pretended not to know.Â "Sorry, I didn't see it."

Â 

JackÂ said, "Now grab the documents and come with me to Mr. Landon's house."

Â 

"What's going on?" Isabella stood up.Â "Why do we need to go there?"

Â 

"To report on work," Jack said.Â "It's Mr. Landon's order.Â We just have to follow."

Â 

"Okay."Â Isabella found it odd; Sebastian was indeed a workaholic, but it seemed like he had never had employees go to his house before.

Â 

However, having been there for only a short time, perhaps it had happened before and she just wasn't aware of it.

Â 

Isabella followed everyone to the Landon familyÂ as night fell. The lights of Azure Wave Garden were on, creating a dreamlike illusion.

Â 

"Mr. Landon's house is so beautiful!"

Â 

"Like a castle!"

Â 

"If I could live in a house like this in my lifetime, I could die a happy person."

Â 

Laura stood by, laughing.Â "A friendly reminder, if you see something shocking later, don't scream."

Â 

"What kind of shocking scene?"

Â 

"Could it be that Mr. Landon has a beautiful wife?"

Â 

"Who's so lucky to marry Mr. Landon."

Â 

"I'm jealous."

Â 

LauraÂ had a jealous look in her eyes and said sarcastically,Â "You'll see when the time comes. I'm just giving you a heads up, hoping you won't get too excited."

Â 

After some discussion, they passed through the courtyard and arrived at the entrance.

Â 

Jack rang the doorbell, and a voice faintly came from inside.Â "Coming."

Â 

"This voice sounds somewhat familiar."

Â 

"I think so too."

Â 

"Could it be someone we know?"

Â 

Everyone looked at Laura.

Â 

But she still had a mysterious expression and didn't bother to explainÂ itÂ to everyone.

Â 

Kelsey, who had been silent, couldn't hold back anymore.Â "It's Vanessa!"

Â 

"Vanessa!"

Â 

"Vanessa with Mr. Landon, really?"

Â 

"This sounds outrageous."

Â 

Kelsey laughed.Â "I also think it's quite outrageous."

Â 

Laura glared at her discontentedly.Â "It's normal for you to find it outrageous.Â After all, Mr. Landon didn't choose you."

Â 

Kelsey sneered, "Whether he chooses me or not doesn't matter. Even if I don't marry Brother Sebastian, I can find a good man to marry in the future. Unlike some people who are always stuck like a puddle of mud against the wall. Just because you wear fake goods, you think you can mix into high society?"

Â 

"You!"

Â 

At this moment, the door opened,Â revealing a familiar face to everyone.

Â 

Indeed, it was Vanessa.

###chapter 92 Take the Medicine

As the door opened, dozens of people outside fell silent.

Â 

Vanessa stood at the door, dressed in a designer outfit, her long hair tied in a low ponytail hanging behind her head.Â She woreÂ slippers, exuding the air of a hostess.Â "Everyone, don't just stand outside, come in."

Â 

Only then did someone said, "Vanessa, so your wealthy and handsome fiancÃ© you mentioned turned out to be Mr. Landon!"

Â 

Immediately, questions arose.

Â 

"No wonderÂ Laura said not to scream.Â I really want to scream now."

Â 

"Vanessa and Mr. Landon, oh my God, I can't believe it."

Â 

"Who could have imagined this? Vanessa isÂ soÂ amazingÂ thatÂ she even captured Mr. Landon."

Â 

"Vanessa gave up her career for Mr. Landon, so did she settle down peacefully like this?"

Â 

Envy filled the air, especially among the female colleagues.Â They lookedÂ at Vanessa with eyes full of jealousy.

Â 

Laura was also envious. She and Vanessa joined the company around the same time, with similar business capabilities. The only aspect where one could outshine the other was probably in looks and figures.

Â 

Vanessa's figure was nothing special, and her looks were quite average.

Â 

On the other hand, Laura had a great figure, and a pretty face.Â And she dared to dress boldly, giving her a seductive aura.

Â 

Generally speaking, women like Laura were more likely to attract men's attention and interest.

Â 

But it was precisely thatÂ Laura wasÂ lost to Vanessa.

Â 

Feeling already unbalanced, seeing everyone surrounding Vanessa at this moment made Laura even more upset.

Â 

Kelsey lightly bumped Isabella's shoulder and whispered, "Look at Vanessa, she's so smug."

Â 

Isabella glanced towards Vanessa, seeing her beaming with joy.Â Indeed this was her moment of triumph.

Â 

"Isabella, you should make a move.Â Sebastian clearly has feelings for you, how can you miss this opportunity?" Kelsey lamented for Isabella.

Â 

Kelsey even thought that if Isabella were standing at the door at this moment, she would genuinely offer a few words of blessing.Â But she didn't want to give Vanessa a blessing anymore.

Â 

Isabella whispered, "Ms. Jose, there's nothing between Mr. Landon and me.Â Please don't spread rumors."

Â 

Kelsey looked at her.Â "Are you really naive or just pretending? How can you not see that Sebastian is interested in you?"

Â 

Isabella pursed her lips, not daring to delve further into this topic.Â So sheÂ changed her shoes to enter the room.

Â 

Sebastian was in the study.Â After everyone entered, they saw him sitting at the desk. Perhaps due to being at home, he wasn't wearing a shirt. He had on a light gray round-neck home outfit and black pants. The light poured down around him, giving him a soft glow.

Â 

HisÂ study was spacious.Â Even with so many people inside, it didn't feel crowded.

Â 

Everyone found their seats and the meeting began.

Â 

Isabella sat farthest away.Â It seemed like Sebastian didn't even notice her, focusing solely on discussing work matters.

Â 

Kelsey sat next to Isabella.Â For the first hour of the meeting, she was sneakily taking photos of Sebastian with her phone and even sent a few to Isabella.

Â 

Isabella looked at the handsome photos of Sebastian on her phone screen, feeling helpless.

Â 

Kelsey gestured to her and whispered, "No need to thank me."

Â 

Isabella was speechless.

Â 

In the second hour, Kelsey started to doze off.

Â 

Kelsey's actions left Isabella puzzled.

Â 

A soft cough came from Sebastian.

Â 

Isabella couldn't help but look over, unsure if it was the lighting, Sebastian's face still appeared slightly flushed, with a hint of fatigue in his eyes.

Â 

As the meeting neared its end, Vanessa knocked on the door and entered, holding a cup in her hand.Â "Is the meeting over? I made some cold medicine for you."

Â 

Sebastian lowered his gaze, tapping his fingers on the table.Â "Leave it there."

Â 

Vanessa walked over.Â Instead of leaving it, she directly handed the cup to Sebastian in front of everyone.Â "Medicine should be taken while it's hot."

Â 

Sebastian paused, then reached out and drank the entire cup of medicine.

Â 

Vanessa smiled with satisfaction, took the empty cup, and said, "I won't disturb you any longer. Come down for dinner after the meeting."

Â 

The sweet interaction between the two left everyone dumbfounded.

Â 

Isabella lowered her eyes, looking at the documents in her hand.Â But she couldn't focus on a single word.

Â 

After the meeting, everyone began to leave the study.

Â 

Isabella saw Kelsey still asleep and nudged her.

Â 

Kelsey suddenly stood up.Â "Is it over?"

Â 

Isabella chuckled.Â "You finally woke up."

Â 

Kelsey stretched lazily.Â "My legs are numb."

Â 

Before she could finish her sentence, her balance shifted, and she almost fell to the side.

Â 

Jack happened to pass by and instinctively reached out to support her.

Â 

Kelsey immediately screamed, "Where are you touching, Jack?"

Â 

Jack was speechless.

Â 

Isabella hadn't noticed before.Â But upon hearing Kelsey's outburst, her gaze fell on Jack's hand.

Â 

The situation was sudden. Jack probably hadn't realized it either, and his hand landed right on Kelsey's chest as she stumbled forward.

Â 

"What's going on?"

Â 

Several girls who had already left heard the commotion and hurried back.

Â 

And so, this scene turned into a major embarrassment for Kelsey.

Â 

Straightening up, Kelsey raised her hand and slapped Jack across the face.Â "Pervert!"

Â 

After uttering this word, she turned and ran out.

Â 

Isabella said, "Jack, Ms. Jose is just like that.Â Don't take it to heart."

Â 

Jack frowned, his gaze cold as he glanced at the girls watching the scene at the door.Â "Have you seen enough?"

Â 

The girls shivered and quickly left.

Â 

"I'll go check on Ms. Jose." Feeling it was inappropriate to stay any longer, Isabella found an excuse and left as well.

Â 

In the study, only Jack and Sebastian remained.

Â 

"Does it hurt?" Sebastian walked over,Â andÂ glanced at Jack's cheek, a hint of schadenfreude in his eyes.

Â 

Jack touched his cheek.Â "Mr. Landon, you're teasing me."

Â 

Sebastian said, "Go have your meal."

Â 

"What about you?"Â asked Jack.

Â 

"I'm feeling a bit unwellÂ andÂ I'll go rest."Â Upon saying that,Â Sebastian left the study.

Â 

Isabella searched downstairs but couldn't find Kelsey.

Â 

Suddenly, she heard the sound of a car engine coming from the yard and rushed out to see Kelsey driving away.

Â 

The people who had been quietly discussing the recent events fell silent as they saw Jack coming downstairs.

Â 

"Ms. Jose left in a huff.Â I hope nothing's wrong," Isabella expressed her concern.

Â 

Jack pausedÂ and took out his car keys.Â "I'll go check on her. You all go ahead and eat."

Â 

With that, he left Azure Wave Garden.

Â 

At that moment, Vanessa's voice rang out.Â "The food is ready.Â Everyone, please go to theÂ dining room."

###chapter 93 His Shirt

Isabella walked into the restaurant and unexpectedly saw Nina.Â "Sis?"

Â 

Nina, who was serving food, looked at Isabella and a hint of embarrassment flashed across her face.

Â 

"Isabella, is this your sister?"

Â 

"Your sister is a nutritionist?"

Â 

The crowd started gossiping, and Nina felt increasingly embarrassed for Isabella. She quickly finished serving the food and left the restaurant.

Â 

"Nina." Isabella followed her outside.

Â 

As she left, the crowd's gossip grew louder.

Â 

"I never expected Isabella's sister to be a nutritionist."

Â 

"What nutritionist? She's just a cook."

Â 

"These dishes look like regular home-cooked meals. Can you believe Mr. Landon enjoys these?"

Â 

Vanessa listened quietly nearby.Â Only when it was appropriate did she said, "Stop gossiping.Â Isabella comes from a humble background, and her sister is also in a difficult situation. Mr. Landon and I took them in out of pity."

Â 

"I see."

Â 

"So, the careÂ Mr. Landon showedÂ toÂ Isabella before was because ofÂ Vanessa?"

Â 

"Vanessa, you are too kind."

Â 

Laura rolled her eyes and said disdainfully, "I always thought Isabella exuded a sense of inferiority from her bones."

Â 

"Nina." Isabella caught up with Nina and grabbed her hand.

Â 

Nina turned to look at her and whispered, "Why are you here? Go back and eat with everyone."

Â 

Isabella frowned.Â "What are you doing here?"

Â 

Nina had no choice but to explain her situation as a nutritionist, "Bella, I'm sorry.Â I didn't know you were here. I was supposed to go back after making Zoe's dinner, but Ms. Field said we had guests coming over and asked me to help prepare a few dishes. You should head back; I don't want to embarrass you."

Â 

As she spoke, she tried to usher Isabella back.

Â 

"Sis!" Isabella held her hand tightly.Â "What's there to be embarrassed about? You earn your living with your own hands."

Â 

Nina was taken aback.Â "But this is not dignifiedÂ after all."

Â 

"Who says it's not dignified? Your cooking skills are excellent. Maybe you can even study to become a nutritionist, get the certification, and then you'll be a legitimate nutritionist,"Â said Isabella.

Â 

Nina was intrigued by Isabella'sÂ idea.Â "I can cook some home-cooked dishes. I see nutritionists make high-end dishes."

Â 

"Who says you have to make high-end dishes to be a nutritionist? A nutritionist, as the name suggests, just needs to make nutritious food that is good for the body. With your skills, I believe you can do it."

Â 

Nina was excited.Â "I'll spend more time studying and researching."

Â 

IsabellaÂ said, "Good."

Â 

Nina then asked Isabella, "You're not mad at me, are you?"

Â 

"Yes!" Isabella deliberately put on a stern face.Â "Of course,Â I'm mad. You found such a good job, such a big event, and you didn't even tell me."

Â 

Nina was stunned, then smiled and hugged Isabella.

Â 

When Isabella returned to the restaurant, everyone was already eating.

Â 

Most of the dishes on the table were made by the nutritionist, with only a few made by Nina.

Â 

Everyone tacitly avoided the dishes Nina made.

Â 

After sitting down, Isabella specifically chose to eat the dishes made by Nina, causing the others to exchange glances.

Â 

"Here's the soup." Vanessa came in with a large bowl of soup and quickly approached Isabella.Â "Excuse me, Isabella."

Â 

"Sure." Isabella put down her fork and stood up, but accidentally collided with Vanessa.

Â 

Before Isabella could react, she felt something heavy hit her leg, and then her clothes were soaked.

Â 

The soup had spilled all over her.

Â 

Vanessa hurriedly brought a clean towel to wipe her.Â "Are you okay? It's all my fault.Â I was careless."

Â 

Isabella took the towel.Â "It's okay."

Â 

Although Vanessa claimed it was unintentional, Isabella felt otherwise.

Â 

There was plenty of space nearby, but Vanessa chose to stand next to her.

Â 

Vanessa intentionally askedÂ NinaÂ toÂ stay to cook. AndÂ it seemed like she wanted to embarrass Isabella.

Â 

"Fortunately, the soup had cooled down a bit; it's not too hot," Vanessa said, though it was unclear whether she was trying to reassure herself or Isabella.

Â 

Seeing Isabella's soaked clothes, Vanessa said, "Your clothes are all dirty. Let me take you upstairs to clean up."

Â 

With such a large bowl of soup spilled on her, it was indeed a mess, greasy and emitting a strong smell of food. It was necessary to clean up.

Â 

So Isabella got up and followed Vanessa upstairs.

Â 

"You can clean up here, and I'll bring you a change of clothes," Vanessa said.

Â 

Isabella wanted to decline, but Vanessa had already left.

Â 

Two minutes later, Vanessa brought a set of clean clothes.Â "I've put them in the closet for you. Take off your clothes, have a quick shower, and change into these. I'll put your dirty clothes in the wash and have them dried for you. It won't take long."

Â 

Looking at herself in the mirror, Isabella realized she couldn't go out like this. So she nodded in agreement.

Â 

After handing over the dirty clothes to Vanessa, sheÂ closed the bathroom door and quickly rinsed herself off.

Â 

When she put on the clothes Vanessa brought, Isabella realized something was wrong.

Â 

There was only a shirt, and it was too big!

Â 

Isabella checked the size and found it was a men's size.

Â 

Perhaps Vanessa had made a mistake in her haste and grabbed the wrong clothes.

Â 

So, this shirt should belong to Sebastian.

Â 

Isabella held the shirt, unsure of what to do for a moment.

Â 

Â There was a commotion outside the door, followed by a knock. Sebastian's voice came through the door.Â "Who's in there?"

Â 

Isabella was at a loss.Â She was too scared to make a sound.

Â 

"Vanessa?" Sebastian asked.

Â 

Isabella still didn't dare to speak.Â 'How can IÂ explain being here and taking a bath in hisÂ bathroom?'

Â 

Luckily, Sebastian outside the door didn't linger and left when he heard no response.

Â 

As she heard the door close, she thought he must have left.

Â 

Isabella couldn't hesitate any longer, so she put on the oversized men's white shirt and opened the bathroom door. Just as she poked her head out, a figure walked out beside her.

Â 

Sebastian saw her and squinted slightly.Â "Isabella?"

Â 

Isabella froze, wanting to retract her head back into the bathroom. But before she could move, Sebastian reached out and held the door frame.

Â 

Sebastian stood in front of Isabella, looking down at her from a higher vantage point. At this moment, Isabella was slightly bent over because the collar was too large.Â From Sebastian's angle, he could see a pair of well-defined breasts.

Â 

Perhaps due to his already elevated temperature, seeing this scene made Sebastian feel all the blood rushing to his head. He felt his nose heat up, and soon blood started to flow.

Â 

"Mr. Landon," Isabella exclaimed.

Â 

But the next moment, Sebastian grabbed her wrist and pulled her out of the bathroom completely.

Â 

###chapter 94 Leaving the Landon Group

Isabella hit straight into Sebastian's armsÂ suddenly.

Â 

She looked up and unexpectedly met Sebastian's deep, dark eyes, her heart racing. SheÂ tried to struggle, but Sebastian held her wrist tightly, not giving her a chance to escape. His dark eyes trapped her like a net.Â "Isabella, we agreed to go our separate ways. Why are you here again?"

Â 

Sebastian's gaze swept over her, thinking about Isabella's body pressed against his shirt,Â whichÂ stirred his uncontrollable passion.Â "Are you doing this on purpose?"

Â 

"Mr. Landon, you misunderstand. It was Ms. Field who brought me in, I..."Â Before Isabella could finish her sentence, Sebastian pinned her against the wall.Â "I had let you go, but this time you came to me."

Â 

"Mr. Landon!"Â shouted Isabella.

Â 

Sebastian's kiss descended upon her, and sheÂ tried to push him away but he pinched her waist.

Â 

"Mr. Landon." Isabella trembled in his grasp.

Â 

Sebastian was almost being driven mad by her, his impulses reaching their peak. He couldn't hear her pleas.

Â 

No matter how Isabella begged and cried, she ended up under the covers.

Â 

Sebastian's actions were almost frantic, like a restrained beast finally set free, his movements rough. Isabella only felt the pain and heat in the area he had pressed down with his fingers.

Â 

"Mr. Landon!"Â At this point, Isabella knew she couldn't stop Sebastian. When she looked up, she saw a square-shaped condom on the bedside table.

Â 

SheÂ reached for it, handed it to Sebastian, and tremblingly said, "Use this."

Â 

Outside the room, Vanessa listened to the sounds coming from inside, her fingernails digging into her palm.

Â 

Yes, this was all her design.

Â 

She had spiked Sebastian's cold medicine with an aphrodisiac.Â The soup spilled on Isabella was also part of her plan.Â Even the condom on the bedside table was her preparation.

Â 

SheÂ did all this to stir Sebastian's emotions. Once he used that condom, she could get what she had always wanted-his sperm.

Â 

Implanting his sperm in her wouldÂ also allow her to get pregnant.

Â 

Listening to the sounds coming from inside, Vanessa was almost going crazy.

Â 

After a while, she turned and expressionlessly went downstairs.

Â 

"Vanessa." Laura walked over, seeing her alone, and asked, "Where is Isabella?"

Â 

"She left."

Â 

"Left?" Laura was surprised. "Didn't you say you were going to take her upstairs to handle something?"

Â 

"She didn't go. She left first,"Â said Vanessa.

Â 

Although Laura was somewhat suspicious, she didn't say much. "What's wrong with you? You look so pale."

Â 

"Nothing." Vanessa forced a smile, telling herself that it was all worth it. Once she passed this test, she could get what she wanted. Once she got pregnant, she could truly become the mistress of this household.

Â 

All she had to do now wasÂ toÂ wait.

Â 

After everyone finished eating, Vanessa saw them off at the door.

Â 

"Vanessa, goodbye."

Â 

"Vanessa, thank you for your and Mr. Landon's hospitality. Remember to come to the company to see us often. We all miss you."

Â 

"Okay." Vanessa smiled and agreed to each one.

Â 

After everyone left, she couldn't maintain the smile on her face any longer.

Â 

"Ms. Field." Nina came out carrying a canvas bag. "The kitchen is all cleaned up. I'm going back."

Â 

"Got it." Vanessa coldly responded and turned back into the house.

Â 

Nina found her behavior strange but didn't dwell on it. As she walked out of the villa, she called Isabella.Â But no one answered the call.

Â 

"It was weird," Nina said.

Â 

She hadn't seen Isabella since then. Even though Vanessa said she had already gone back, Nina was still worried. She wanted to call Isabella to check on her, but after several attempts, no one answered.

Â 

Just as Nina was about to call a cab to go to Harvar University to check on Isabella, Isabella called back.

Â 

Nina quickly answered the call.Â "Bella, why are you only answering now?"

Â 

"Sis, I'm fine."Â said Isabella.

Â 

"What's wrong with your voice?" Nina could tell something was off with Isabella's voice.

Â 

"I'm fine. I took a nap in the dorm.Â My phone was on silentÂ and IÂ just woke up."

Â 

"I see." Nina breathed a sigh of relief. "Rest well, I'll hang up."

Â 

"Okay."Â After hanging up, Isabella looked back at the sleeping Sebastian, grabbed her coat, and walked out of the room.

Â 

"Isabella." A voice suddenly called out to her.

Â 

Isabella froze in her tracks.

Â 

Vanessa walked up from behind, looking at her flushed face, disheveled hair, and rumpled collar, as if she understood something.Â Her faceÂ wasÂ filled with shock.Â "What's wrong with you?"

Â 

Isabella shook her head, tears falling, feeling incredibly humiliated at that moment.

Â 

She had done that with Sebastian and was caught red-handed by Vanessa.

Â 

"Wait for me hereÂ andÂ don't leave. I'll go in and take a look," Vanessa said as she stepped into the bedroom.

Â 

The bedroom was dimly lit, the bed in disarray, the air filled with the scent of lovemaking.

Â 

Sebastian was sleeping soundly. Vanessa went straight to the trash can, took out the used condom, and put it in a tube she had prepared.

Â 

After sorting everything out, she walked out.

Â 

"Isabella, what did you do with Mr. Landon?" Vanessa's voice turned stern.

Â 

"I'm sorry." Isabella lowered her head, unable to face her.

Â 

"Do you expect me to forgive you for doing such a thing?" Vanessa sneered. "Isabella, I can pretend that nothing happened last night, but you have to promise me one thing."

Â 

Isabella looked up.Â "What is it?"

Â 

"Leave the Landon GroupÂ andÂ never show up in front of Mr. Landon again. This is my final kindness to you."

Â 

Early the next morning, Sebastian woke up from a daze, opened his eyes, and saw Vanessa's face.

Â 

"Sebastian, are you awake?" Vanessa lay naked in his arms, one leg under the blanket resting on his waist, in a very intimate position.

Â 

Sebastian rubbed his slightly sore temples, looking at her with suspicion.Â "Was it you last night?"

Â 

"Of course it was me. Who else could it be?"Â Vanessa rolled over and sat on his waist.Â "When Mr. Landon and I are together, are you still thinking about others?"

Â 

Sebastian looked at her, but the passion from last night was gone.

Â 

He grabbed Vanessa's wrist, moved her aside, and sat up.

Â 

The room was in chaos, tissues filled the trash can, almost overflowing.

Â 

But Sebastian vividly remembered the moans under him being Isabella's, yet today it had turned into Vanessa.Â Perhaps it was all his illusion.

Â 

HisÂ phone rang, it was Jack calling.

Â 

JackÂ said, "Hello, Mr. Landon, something's happened."

###chapter 95  Food Poisoning

An hour later, at the hospital, Sebastian and Vanessa arrived to find Jack already waiting at the entrance.

Â 

Upon seeing Sebastian, Jack greeted him, "Mr. Landon."

Â 

"What's going on?" Vanessa asked, "Why has everyone suddenly fallen ill?"

Â 

Jack's expression was also very serious.Â "I asked the doctor, and he said it's food poisoning."

Â 

Sebastian stopped in his tracks, a look of doubt flashing across his face.Â "Food poisoning?"

Â 

"Yes. The first to show symptoms was Laura Jones, who came to the hospital at one in the morning. I asked her, and she said she hadn't eaten anything else after having dinner at your house last night. The situations of the other people are also basically the same, so now everyone suspects whether the ingredients from last night were not fresh,"Â said Jack.

Â 

"Impossible!" Vanessa immediately said, "All the ingredients for the house were delivered that day. Since we were hosting everyone last night, I personally checked everything several times. The ingredients were very fresh, absolutely no problem there."

Â 

Jack's expression became even more serious.Â "If it's not the ingredients, then there is only one possibility left."

Â 

Sebastian remained silent.

Â 

Â Vanessa askedÂ anxiously, "What possibility?"

Â 

"It's not ruled out that someone poisoned the food,"Â Jack said.

Â 

"Poisoned!" Vanessa exclaimed in shock, "The food last night was prepared by our nutritionist at home. Although I didn't watch the whole process, we usually eat the same things, so there shouldn't be any problems."

Â 

Just as they were speaking, a police car arrived and stopped behind the three of them, and two officers got out of the car.

Â 

Sebastian frowned.Â "Who called the police?"

Â 

"Laura Jones," Jack said.Â "She had already called the police before I arrived."

Â 

After the officers investigated and asked around, the target of this collective poisoning incident was finally directed at last night's dinner.

Â 

"Mr. Landon, can we come to your house to collect evidence and investigate?" asked one officer.

Â 

Before Sebastian could speak, Vanessa said, "Sure, there's still some leftovers from last night in the house."

Â 

Sebastian glanced at her with a frown but didn't say anything.

Â 

The group returned to the Landon family.

Â 

Zoe was sunbathing in the yard, and Nina was busy in the kitchen.

Â 

Suddenly, with so many people coming in, Nina was startled, but quickly eased.Â "Ms. Field, what's going on?"

Â 

Vanessa walked over, stood by Nina's side, and comforted her, "Nina, don't be nervous. The police are just here to check on last night's dinner. I remember there were some leftovers, and I asked you to put them in the fridge, right?"

Â 

"Yes." Nina turned around and brought two plates of food from the fridge.

Â 

After the officers collected evidence, Vanessa asked her to dispose of it.

Â 

Nina felt uneasy but couldn't find anyone to ask. Just then, Jack came down from upstairs, and Nina stopped him.Â "Mr. Jack, what's going on? Is there something wrong with last night's dinner?"

Â 

The police had come to collect evidence, and the two dishes left from last night happened to be ones she had made.

Â 

Because no one liked her cooking, except Isabella, no one had touched the food.

Â 

Isabella had a small appetite and hadn't eaten much.

Â 

ThatÂ was why there was so much left.

Â 

Seeing Nina looking worried, Jack couldn't bear to hide it from her and told her, "Everyone who had dinner here last night ended up in the hospital because of unbearable stomach pain."

Â 

Except for him and Kelsey, as the two of them hadn't stayed for dinner.

Â 

"Stomach pain, is it because of the ingredients?" Nina didn't even think about herself.

Â 

Jack said, "The test results show it's food poisoning."

Â 

"Poisoning?" Nina's face turned pale.Â "Is it that serious?"

Â 

"Yes, quite serious," Jack said.Â "You better be prepared. If they find poison in the leftovers, you will definitely be called in for questioning."

Â 

Upon hearing this, Nina turned even paler.

Â 

Jack had other things to attend to and didn't stay long, so he left.

Â 

Nina took a while to calm down before suddenly remembering something.

Â 

"Bella!" She took out her phone and anxiously dialed Isabella's number.

Â 

Isabella was awakened by the phone ringing.Â "Sis?"

Â 

"Bella, where are you now? Are you okay? Is the child okay?" Nina's voice was trembling.

Â 

Isabella had just woken up and was still a bit groggy.

Â 

She propped herself up on her elbow.Â "I'm fine. What's wrong?"

Â 

Upon hearing that she was okay, Nina's tense heart relaxed.Â "Mr. Jack said that all your colleagues in the department were hospitalized due to food poisoning. They said it was from last night's dinner.Â The police just came to collect evidence. Bella, are you really okay?"

Â 

As Nina spoke, Isabella had already started getting dressed.

Â 

She had been tossed around by Sebastian last night, so she had been lying down until now.

Â 

At this moment, Isabella knew Nina was scared, so she wanted to go and comfort her. But halfway through getting dressed, she remembered that she had promised Vanessa last night never to appear in front of Sebastian again.

Â 

If she went now, she would be breaking her promise.

Â 

"Don't worry for now. Things will definitely be investigated thoroughly. But I'm not able to come over right now,"Â said Isabella.

Â 

"It's okay. Don't worry.Â I'll take care of myself." Nina reassured her.

Â 

Isabella bit her lip.Â "Okay."

Â 

After hanging up the phone, sheÂ still felt uneasy.

Â 

She logged into her email, wrote a resignation letter, and sent it to Jack.

Â 

Then she prepared a few resumes and sent them to a few companies.

Â 

It wasn't until threeÂ o'clockÂ in the afternoon that Isabella suddenly received a call from the police station.

Â 

They said Nina was suspected of poisoning and had been taken in for questioning, asking her to come over.

Â 

Receiving the call, Isabella couldn't think clearly.

Â 

When she first heard about this in the morning, she was also shocked. But after calming down, she figured it was probably due to contaminated ingredients, certainly not something Nina would be involved in.

Â 

This result was unexpected.

Â 

And the accusation was serious, being suspected of poisoning weighed heavily on Isabella's heart.

Â 

Arriving at the police station, Sebastian's car was parked outside.

Â 

Isabella's heart sank,Â she tightened her lips and walked in.

Â 

As soon as she entered the lobby, Isabella saw Sebastian.

Â 

Sebastian was dressed in a deep black suit, his coat draped over his arm, standing there talking to someone. The light from above tilted down, casting a faint white light over him, giving him an air of nobility.

Â 

Isabella hesitated whether to change her path, but Sebastian turned his gaze towards her.

Â 

Sebastian's deep blue eyes, like an invisible net, instantly enveloped Isabella.

Â 

He had finished his conversation with the other person but still stood in place.Â His gaze locked on Isabella, deep emotions flowing in his eyes.

Â 

Isabella wasn't sure if Sebastian was going to settle the score from last night. Perhaps she should pretend to be calm and walk up to him as if nothing had happened.

Â 

But her feet seemed rooted to the spot, unable to move an inch.Â She stood there like a statue.

Â 

It wasn't until Vanessa appeared, affectionately taking Sebastian's hand.Â "Sebastian, I'm fine."

###chapter 96 I'm called Richard

"Okay," Sebastian responded, but his eyes were always on Isabella's side.

Â 

Vanessa followed his gaze, squeezed out a smile,Â and greeted, "Hi, Isabella."

Â 

Isabella lowered her head, calmed her emotions, and then walked over.Â "Mr. Landon, Ms. Field. I'm here to pick up my sister."

Â 

"Your sister?" Vanessa looked uneasy.Â "I'm afraid it won't be over for a while. Everyone got food poisoning fromÂ eating Nina's food, soÂ she must take responsibility for this."

Â 

Isabella's pupils contracted.Â "I believe in my sister.Â She wouldn't poison anyone, and there must be a problem with the ingredients!"

Â 

"I understand your feelings, but the police came to collect evidence. And harmful substances were found in the food made by Nina, she can't escape this,"Â said Vanessa.

Â 

In the face of evidence, no amount of talk seemed pale.

Â 

"But I ate it too, why am I fine?"

Â 

Vanessa looked meaningfully at Sebastian, seeing his gaze still fixed on Isabella's face.Â She felt displeased.Â "Perhaps because she's your sister, so she didn't target you?"

Â 

Isabella was speechless.Â She could see that Vanessa was targeting Nina.

Â 

Of course, Isabella believed that Nina was innocentÂ because she only ate the food made by Nina last night.Â While others didn't even touch a fork, they all ate the food made by another nutritionist.

Â 

Now all the blame was shifted to Nina, it was obvious that Nina was being targeted.

Â 

Unfortunately, Isabella couldn't provide any evidence, no one would believe her.

Â 

At this moment, Jack walked out of theÂ room.Â "Mr. Landon, the bail procedures have been taken care of."

Â 

Isabella was surprised, Sebastian actually arranged bail for Nina.

Â 

"Can I see the paperwork?" Isabella asked.

Â 

Jack glanced at Sebastian first.Â When he had no objections, he handed the bail paper to Isabella.

Â 

Isabella took a look.Â Bail money wasÂ five hundredÂ Dollars.

Â 

She asked, "TheÂ money?"

Â 

"I paid for it," Jack replied.

Â 

Isabella nodded.Â "Thank you, Mr. Jack.Â I'll transfer the money to you later."

Â 

"Okay." Jack knew she was stubborn, so he didn't bother being polite with her.

Â 

"Sebastian, I'm tired.Â Let's go back," Vanessa gently said, pulling Sebastian's arm.

Â 

Sebastian glanced at her, then said to Jack, "You stay and take them back."

Â 

"Alright, Mr. Landon."

Â 

Sebastian withdrew his gaze and then left with Vanessa.

Â 

Sebastian got into the back seat, and Vanessa was about to open the car door to get in.Â ButÂ she heard him say, "Jack's not here.Â You drive."

Â 

"Me?" Vanessa hesitated, her smile somewhat forced.Â "I'm not a driver."

Â 

Sebastian frowned.Â "If you really can't, then wait for them together."

Â 

He meant to go with Isabella and Nina...

Â 

Vanessa was highly suspiciousÂ thatÂ this was just an excuse Sebastian found.Â He couldn't let go of IsabellaÂ andÂ he wanted to be with Isabella.

Â 

"I'll drive." Vanessa had to compromise.

Â 

She closed the back seat doorÂ and walkedÂ to the passenger side. Holding the steering wheel, she took a few deep breaths before opening the car door and getting in.

Â 

As the car left the police station, Vanessa played a soothing tune.

Â 

At this moment, she wanted to find some topics to chat with Sebastian.

Â 

But Sebastian was lazy, he even closed his eyes directly and said, "I'm tired. I'll take a nap. Wake me up when we get home."

Â 

Vanessa was speechless.

Â 

Although Nina was bailed out, the suspicion still lingered.

Â 

Fortunately, theyÂ didn't cause much harm, just mild symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea.

Â 

Everyone stayed in the hospital for a couple of days, got a few IV drips, andÂ finally,Â they were fine.

Â 

But Nina couldn't work as a nutritionist for the Landon family anymore.

Â 

Charlie didn't spare herÂ these days.

Â 

Nina felt guilty and couldn't eat or sleep well.Â Her heart was always heavy.

Â 

In the morning, as she went downstairs to take out the trash, she was almost hit by a car.

Â 

The garbage fell all over the groundÂ whenÂ the car barely stopped in time, just brushing against her knee.

Â 

The car door opened. AÂ manÂ walked over, and a pair of exquisite men's leather shoes caught Nina's eye.

Â 

Before the man could start scolding her, Nina quickly apologized, "I'm sorry."

Â 

"Are you a professional blackmailer?" A deep male voice sounded from above, with a hint of playfulness and teasing.

Â 

Nina was speechless.

Â 

The man squatted down in front of her, grabbed her hands that were picking up trash,Â andÂ furrowed his brows.Â "God gave you such beautiful hands, not for picking up trash."

Â 

Richard's grip was strong and powerful, firmly holding her wrist, exuding a sense of male strength.

Â 

Nina looked up, staring at Richard in front of her.Â "Is it you?"

Â 

It was that Richard who looked fierce as if his gazeÂ aloneÂ could killÂ a people.

Â 

"I'm Richard Cole. Remember that?" Richard suddenly introduced himself, makingÂ Nina a bit stunned.Â Recalling the previous incident, she still felt a bit scared.Â She retracted her hand.Â "I lied to you last time, but it was to protect myself. Are you still bothered by that?"

Â 

Bothered enough that he hadÂ appeared in front of herÂ several timesÂ just to intimidate her.

Â 

Richard stared into her eyes and asked, "Do I look like a bad guy to you?"

Â 

Nina nodded, very sincerely.Â "Definitely not a good person."

Â 

Who would think a good person lookedÂ so fierce?

Â 

She felt that with Richard's appearance, even a grin would make passing children cry.

Â 

Richard frowned.

Â 

When he frowned, he looked even more fierce.Â "You're honest."

Â 

Nina tried to pull her hand back, but Richard held it firmly.Â As he stood up, he also pulled Nina up from the ground.

Â 

Richard's dominance made alarm bells ring in Nina's mind.Â She was about to speak but saw him let go of her hand.Â He squatted down again.

Â 

In Nina's surprised gaze, he picked up the scattered trash on the ground one by one and threw it into the trash can.

Â 

Somehow, Nina's heart softened a bit.Â When she looked at him again, she didn't feel he was that fierce anymore.

Â 

"It's done, you can go now." Richard walked back, still speaking in a cold tone.

Â 

"Your hands are dirty," Nina said.

Â 

Richard opened his hands, indeed very dirty.

Â 

It was kitchen waste, not only dirty but also a bit smelly.

Â 

"Go wash up?" Nina hesitated to speak.

Â 

Richard's eyes flickered.Â "Aren't you afraid I'm a bad person, yet you want to take me home?"

Â 

Nina explained, "Don't get me wrong.Â There's water in the garden outside my house, so you can wash there."

Â 

Although Richard helped her pick up the trash, she wasn't naive enough to relax her guard against him.

Â 

Nina just felt that it was her family's trash that dirtied Richard's hands, and there was no place downstairs to clean up.Â This was what she should do.

Â 

"Let's go." Nina turned and walked into the entrance.

Â 

Richard stood still for a few seconds, then followed.

Â 

Nina's entry garden wasn't large, but she kept it clean. She also had some flowers and plants, and one crabapple tree bloomed the best.

Â 

Nina took out hand soap from the cabinet and placed it on the sink.Â "Use this to wash."

Â 

As Richard turned on the tap, Charlie walked out from the elevator, giving Richard a hostile glance.Â "Who's this?"

 ###chapter 97 Separation

Nina was startled.Â "Aren't you supposed to be at the office?"

Â 

Charlie noticed her nervousness and walked over, grabbing herÂ wrist tightly.Â "What have you been doing at home all day? It turnedÂ outÂ that you've been cheating on me behind my back.Â Nina Miller, do you think I'm dead?"

Â 

Nina blushed at Charlie's words.Â "You're talking nonsense!"

Â 

"I am not. Alright, explain to me, who is this man?"Â asked Charlie.

Â 

Nina opened her mouth, but for a moment, she didn't know where to begin explaining.Â After all, she and Richard were really not familiar.

Â 

"You bitch!" Charlie raised his hand as if to slap Nina.

Â 

Suddenly, a hand intervened, accurately grabbing Charlie's wrist and holding his hand high in the air.

Â 

Richard instinctively shielded Nina behind him, his cold eyes scanning Charlie's thin face with disdain and contempt.

Â 

It seemed as if for Richard, crushing Charlie would be as simple as squishing an ant.

Â 

Charlie was neither as tall nor as strong as Richard.

Â 

The two faced off, with Charlie exerting all his strength but unable to budge Richard .

Â 

Charlie couldn't even pull his hand back; it remained held high by Richard.

Â 

Desperate, Charlie dropped his briefcase and tried to sneak a blow with his other hand.

Â 

Richard's gaze sharpened and with a gentle twist of Charlie's wrist.Â There was a crisp sound.

Â 

Charlie hesitated for a moment, then burst into a painful howl.

Â 

Richard let go.Â Charlie collapsed on the ground like trash, writhing in pain.

Â 

Watching this scene, Nina's heart trembled.

Â 

Richard realized something, turned around, and took a step towards her.

Â 

"Don't come any closer!" Nina's face filled with fear, she stepped back abruptly, her waist hitting the sharp corner of the shoe cabinet, causing a sharp pain.

Â 

Richard, observing her fear, said, "Men who hit women don't deserve sympathy."

Â 

Nina bit her lip.Â "He's my husband, this is our family matter. Sir, please wash your hands and leave immediately."

Â 

Furrowing his brow, Richard's aura of menace was enough to intimidate.

Â 

"If you don't leave now, I will call the police!" Nina threatened.

Â 

After a moment's contemplation, Richard turned and walked away.

Â 

Nina took Charlie to the hospital, where they found out his wrist was dislocated.

Â 

After some medication, Nina and Charlie returned home.

Â 

Once inside, Charlie sat on the shoe-changing bench.Â "Change my shoes."

Â 

Nina hesitated, then walked over and crouched down to help him change his shoes.

Â 

Charlie swaggered into the room, leaned back on the sofa, and propped his feet up on the coffee table.Â "Pour me a glass of water. I'm thirsty."

Â 

Nina frowned in disgust.Â "I just cleaned the coffee table. Can you not put your feet on it?"

Â 

"This is my house.Â I can do whatever I want. It's none of your business!"Â said Charlie.

Â 

"I'm your wife." Nina's eyes turned red.

Â 

Charlie glanced at her, sneering, "You can't even bear a child.Â What kind of wife are you? At best, you're just my accessory. Look at yourself, looking like a ghost, unable to accomplish anything. Besides me, who else would want you? You should be grateful that I don't despise you and give youÂ aÂ shelter. Otherwise, how could you live in such a nice house?Â Why are you still standing there?Â Pour the water!"

Â 

Nina turned and went into the kitchen, pouring herself a few glasses of water first.

Â 

The water was warm, flowing down her throat.Â But it couldn't warm her gradually chilling heart.

Â 

In the living room, Charlie impatiently urged, "Is it ready yet? Do you want me to die of thirst?"

Â 

Nina poured a glass of hot water and walked out of the kitchen.

Â 

Charlie, acting like a lord, lounged on the sofa watching TV. HeÂ glanced at her and complained, "Even pouring a glass of water takes you so long. What else can I expect from you?"

Â 

Nina pursed her lips and handed him the glass.

Â 

Just as Charlie reached out to take it, she suddenly tipped the glass.

Â 

The scalding water spilled all over Charlie, some directly on the back of his hand.

Â 

"Are you crazy, Nina?"

Â 

The cup fell to the ground, shattering.

Â 

Startled by the commotion, Charlie stopped yelling and looked at Nina.

Â 

"Charlie, we're done,"Â said Nina.

Â 

The room fell silent for a few seconds. Charlie stared wide-eyed.Â "What's gotten into you?"

Â 

Without further explanation, Nina turned and went back to the bedroom. SheÂ took out a suitcase from the closet and began packing.

Â 

She had only packed a few changes of clothes when Charlie walked in.

Â 

Seeing Nina's actions, he not only didn't try to stop her but sneered, "Alright, you've grown some backbone. I knew you had someone else outside, otherwise,Â how could you dare to be so arrogant with me? It's that man from this morning, right?Â You deliberately let me see itÂ and deliberately made me angry, then quarreled with me.Â Now you're finding reasons to split up?"

Â 

No matter how Charlie ranted and insulted, Nina remained silent, packing quickly as if eager to escape.

Â 

Charlie paced back and forth at the door, then suddenly rushed in, pressing Nina down on the bed.

Â 

He shouted, "I'm talking to you.Â Are you deaf?"

Â 

Nina struggled, accidentally scratching his face with her fingers, leaving a blood mark on Charlie's face.

Â 

"You are so restless.Â Today I want to see how you can be arrogant with me,"Â shouted Charlie.

Â 

There was a huge disparity in power between men and women. Although Charlie couldn't defeat a burly man like Richard, he had the upper hand against Nina.

Â 

For the next few minutes, Nina was defenseless against Charlie's blows.

Â 

Charlie's fists rained down on her, showing no mercy.

Â 

At first, Nina managed to resist a few times.Â Eventually, she just curled up, completely unable to move.

Â 

After venting his anger, Charlie sat on the bed and lit a cigarette.

Â 

Soon, the room was filled with smoke.

Â 

Charlie gradually calmed down, turned to look at NinaÂ who was still curled up in the corner of the bed, frowned, and said, "Get up.Â Stop pretending to be dead. You said you wanted to leave, then go!"

Â 

But Nina remained motionless.

Â 

After another two minutes, Charlie realized something was wrong when he saw that she hadn't moved at all.

Â 

Hastily stubbing out his cigarette, he walked over and shook Nina.Â "Nina?"

Â 

As he shook her, Nina turned over.

Â 

Her eyes were tightly shut, her face swollen, looking ashenÂ and her breathing weak.

Â 

"Nina!" Charlie quickly picked her up and rushed out of the house.

Â 

Isabella wanted to call Nina to ask about the progress of the food poisoning incident.

Â 

She dialed several times but no one answered.

Â 

Finally, someone picked up.

Â 

To her surprise, it was Charlie's voice.

Â 

"Bella, what's up?"

Â 

Isabella didn't like Charlie, butÂ because ofÂ Nina, she couldn't show her dislike too openly.Â "I'm looking for my sister."

Â 

"She's not here,"Â said Charlie.

Â 

Isabella sensed something was off. Nina never parted with her phone because she was afraid of missing Isabella's calls. Every time Isabella called Nina, Nina would answer immediately.

Â 

She asked, "Where did my sister go?"

Â 

"I'm not sure.Â It seemedÂ like she went out shopping with friends."

Â 

Isabella said, "Okay, I got it."

Â 

After hanging up, she immediately took a taxi to Green Valley Community.

Â 

Â 

 ###chapter 98 Want to Abort the Child

Charlie's lies couldn't fool Isabella.

Â 

In this city, Isabella and Nina depended on each other and hardly had any friends.

Â 

Isabella felt something was wrong and decided to visit Nina.Â However, after pressing the doorbell for a long time, no one came to open the door.

Â 

The house password had been changed, but Nina had informed her in advance, fearing she might not be able to enter if she came over urgently.

Â 

Isabella hesitated for a moment but finally entered the password and went inside.

Â 

A strong medicinal smell filled the room as Isabella walked in barefoot. SheÂ immediately noticed the scattered glass shards in the living room.

Â 

Her heart tightened as she quickly walked to the master bedroom door.

Â 

The scene inside shook Isabella to the core.

Â 

The bedroom was in chaos, the bed messy, a toppled suitcase nearby, and clothes strewn all over.

Â 

There were cigarette ashes and butts scattered on the bed and floor.

Â 

This was clearly a scene of domestic violence. Nina had been beaten again!

Â 

Watching the scene, Isabella's heart ached.

Â 

She took out her phone, takingÂ a few photos and a video.

Â 

Then she left Nina's house and headed straight to the hospital.

Â 

At the hospital,Â Nina slowly woke up and when she saw Charlie, she closed her eyes again.

Â 

Her body ached, but her heart ached even more.

Â 

Charlie held her hand.Â "Nina, you're awake. I've been watching over you for a long time.Â I was really worried about you."

Â 

Nina kept her eyes closed, refusing to acknowledge him.

Â 

"I'm sorry, Nina.Â I'm a jerk.Â I shouldn't have laid a hand on you."Â As Charlie spoke, he slapped himself repeatedly.

Â 

He slapped his face heavilyÂ without mercyÂ and heÂ kept apologizing non-stop.

Â 

It was at this moment that Isabella pushed the door open and entered.

Â 

Seeing the scene, she wrinkled her nose in disgustÂ andÂ pushed Charlie away.Â "Stay away from my sister!"

Â 

Nina opened her eyes.Â "Bella."

Â 

"Sis." Isabella looked at the injuries on Nina's face, her heart aching.Â "I've always saidÂ thatÂ domestic violence is either zero times or countless times!"

Â 

Nina forced a bitter smile, her voice weak.Â "I should have listened to you.Â I was too soft-hearted."

Â 

SheÂ rarely cried in front of Isabella, but now her eyes were red, clearly unable to bear it any longer.

Â 

At that moment, the doctor walked in.

Â 

"Nina, are you feeling better?" the doctor asked at the foot of the bed.

Â 

Nina nodded.Â "A little better."

Â 

The doctor glanced at Charlie, his expression somewhat conflicted.Â "There's something I need to tell you."

Â 

"Please go ahead,"Â Charlie said.

Â 

The doctor paused, then said to Nina, "You're pregnant, did you know?"

Â 

"What?" Nina was thunderstruck, completely dumbfounded.

Â 

Isabella was also stunned.Â She asked the doctor, "What did you say?"

Â 

Charlie beside her,Â also jolted.Â He instantly became vigorous, his eyes gleaming.Â "You mean my wife is pregnant?Â Is sheÂ really pregnant?"

Â 

The doctor looked at Charlie, his expression serious.Â "How could you lay a hand on a woman?"

Â 

Charlie was ecstatic.Â "I'm a jerk.Â But I didn't know she was pregnant. If I had known, I would have taken care of her. I should never have hit her."

Â 

The doctor frowned.Â "Whether she's pregnant or not, as a man, you should never lay a hand on a woman."

Â 

"Yes, I'm a jerk.Â I'll never lay a hand on her again." Charlie promised earnestly.

Â 

He took a few steps towards the hospital bed, trying to get closer to Nina.

Â 

Isabella stared at him warily, not allowing him to approach.

Â 

Charlie awkwardly stopped, smiling.Â "Bella, I really know I was wrong."

Â 

Isabella looked at him coldly.Â "You said the same thing last time!"

Â 

Isabella had long known that Charlie was unreliable. But Nina wouldn't listen to her.

Â 

And now, Nina was pregnant with Charlie's child. She was confused about Nina's future.

Â 

"This time it was out of reason. I lost my temper and that was why I hit you" Charlie looked at Nina.Â "Nina, I was overly suspicious. For the sake of the child, please forgive me this once."

Â 

"Sis!" Isabella, fearing Nina's soft-heartedness, quickly grabbed her hand.

Â 

Nina closed her eyes.Â "I'm tired and bemused now.Â Charlie, you go back first.Â I need to think."

Â 

"Okay, I'll go back and make soup for you. Bella, thank you for staying with Nina," Charlie said before happily leaving.

Â 

Due to Nina's pregnancy, many medications couldn't be used, and even saline couldn't be administered.

Â 

Feeling stifled in the hospital, Isabella suggestedÂ NinaÂ goÂ out for a walk.

Â 

Nina pointed to her face.Â "Look at me now. I'll scare people if I go out."

Â 

Her eyes were filled with exhaustion, not physical exhaustion, but the exhaustion of the soul.

Â 

"Sis, you're not in a good state right now.Â You need to go out for a walk," Isabella said, taking out two things from her bag: aÂ face mask and a baseball cap.Â "This way, others won't see the injuries on your face."

Â 

Unable to resist Isabella, Nina reluctantly followed her outside.

Â 

There was a large shopping mall near the hospital, so theyÂ walked there.

Â 

Shopping could lift one's spirits, and buying things even more so.

Â 

Isabella picked out two dresses from the rack and gestured to Nina.Â "Sis, try these on.Â They should look good on you."

Â 

Nina said she didn't need to, but Isabella still pushed her into the fitting room.

Â 

However, not long after, Nina came out.

Â 

"Why didn't you try them on?"Â asked Isabella.

Â 

Nina was still wearing her own clothes. She hung the two dresses back on the rack, took Isabella's arm, and walked out.Â "They're not suitableÂ for me."

Â 

In fact, it wasn't that they weren't suitable.Â It was just that she glanced at the price tag and couldn't bear to spend the money.

Â 

Understanding her thoughts, Isabella said, "How about I treat you to bubble tea?"

Â 

Nina touched her belly, uncertain.Â "Can I drink bubble tea while pregnant?"

Â 

"You can just drink less," Isabella said, then went to line up.

Â 

Nina sat on a bench nearby, waiting for her.

Â 

But when Isabella turned around with two cups of bubble tea, she found the bench empty.

Â 

Isabella looked around and finally saw Nina's figure in a maternity store.

Â 

She was standing in front of an exquisite cradle, beautifully decorated by the store with a pink canopy, colorful rotating mobiles hanging above, a light pink blanket inside the cradle, a small pillow, and a soft plush toy.

Â 

Isabella walked over.Â "Sis."

Â 

"Bella, isn't this cradle beautiful?"Â asked Nina.

Â 

"Yes." Isabella nodded.Â "If you give me a niece.Â As an aunt, I'll buy her this."

Â 

Nina lowered her gaze, her fingers always touching her abdomen. SheÂ said with a bitter smile, "I can't even provide a complete home for him.Â What right do I have to be a mother?"

Â 

Isabella's eyes sparkled.Â "What do you mean?"

Â 

Nina took a deep breath, raisingÂ her eyes.Â "I want to abort this child."

Â 

 ###chapter 99 No More Smiles

Isabella was somewhat taken aback.

Â 

"You're right.Â From the momentÂ Charlie WilsonÂ laid hands on me, we can't go back. Since we've decided to end it, this child can't stay," Nina said, touching her belly with a pained look.

Â 

Only Nina knew how much she longed for this child. She knew the taste of drinking medicine daily until she threw up; that pain was only understood by her.

Â 

Now that the child was there, she had to abort it.Â The afflictionÂ in her heart, only she could comprehend.

Â 

Isabella felt a dull pain in her heart, reaching out to support Nina. "Whatever decision you make, I support you."

Â 

Not far away, Sebastian and Jack stood together, watching from a distance.

Â 

"Mr. Landon, is that Isabella?" asked Jack.

Â 

Sebastian remained silent, his gaze fixed on Isabella.

Â 

Jack observed, "Should we go say hello?"

Â 

"No need." Sebastian withdrew his gaze.

Â 

Since they were destined to be from different worlds, all he could do was keep his distance.

Â 

"What about Isabella Miller resigning?" Jack informed Sebastian as soon as he received the resignation letter. He knew Sebastian had special feelings for Isabella.

Â 

Without Sebastian's approval, Jack didn't dare to act on his own.

Â 

But this delay had dragged on severalÂ days.

Â 

After a moment of silence, Sebastian said, "Approved."

Â 

Jack's eyes betrayed a hint of regret. "Understood."

Â 

Sebastian gave Isabella one last glance before stepping into the elevator.

Â 

Jack followed.

Â 

Sebastian instructed, "Handle Nina Miller's matter."

Â 

"Okay,"Â said Jack.

Â 

At noon, Charlie brought over a pot of rib soup.

Â 

As he offered a spoonful to Nina, she turned her head away. "Bella, step outside for a moment.Â I need to talk to him."

Â 

"Alright." Isabella walked to the door, closed it behind her, but kept her ears peeled for any sounds inside.

Â 

If Charlie dared to harm Nina, she would definitely rush in, regardless of whether she could handle him, and give Charlie a beating.

Â 

Inside the ward, Charlie scooped up another spoonful of soup and blew on it.Â "I tasted it.Â The seasoning is just right.Â Try a sip."

Â 

Nina pushed his hand away. "I have no appetite."

Â 

CharlieÂ said, "Fine. I'll leave it here. When you feel like it, I'll heat it up for you."

Â 

"Charlie Wilson, let'sÂ get a divorce." Nina's voice was calm.

Â 

Charlie paused, looking at her incredulously. "At this point, are you saying something foolish?"

Â 

"I'm not saying anything foolish." Nina stared into Charlie's eyes.Â "I've thought about it, and I want a divorce."

Â 

"Just because I lost control and hit you?" Charlie's expression turned cold. "Nina, divorce is a big deal. I hope you think it through. After all, becauseÂ you're pregnant, do you really want the child to grow up without a father? Or are you planning to remarry with my child? As long as I'm alive, I will never allow my child to call another man dad."

Â 

Nina pursed her lips. "I know."

Â 

Charlie hurried to hold Nina's hand.Â "You know I didn't mean to hit you. I saw you bringing a man home, soÂ I lost control out of anger. I've thought about it carefully. I shouldn't have laid a hand on you. You don't knowÂ that I've been having a hard time at work lately. Plus, my mom has been pressuring us to have a child. I was in a bad mood, that's why I couldn't control myself. Now that you're pregnant, our relationship has a guarantee. Nina, I promise I won't lay a hand on you again. Once you give birth to our baby, the three of us will live happily together."

Â 

Nina listened quietly as Charlie spoke, then slowly withdrew her hand.

Â 

Then she calmly said, "I know you won't allow me to divorce with the child, so I've made up my mindÂ to get an abortion."

Â 

Charlie widened his eyes.Â "What do you mean? You want to harm this child?Â Nina, you're so heartless!"

Â 

Nina looked away. "Let's part ways amicably."

Â 

"Part ways amicably?" Charlie stood up, staring fiercely at Nina.Â "You say we'll part ways amicably? It's not that easy."

Â 

The calmer Nina appeared the more agitated Charlie became.

Â 

He said, "I'm telling you now.Â If you dare touch my child, you'll never be able to divorce forever!"

Â 

A few minutes later, Charlie stormed out.

Â 

Isabella returned to the room.Â "Did he hurt you?"

Â 

Nina weakly shook her head, her eyes reddening. She said,Â "You've been with me all day, not going to work, won't the boss deduct your pay?"

Â 

Isabella didn't want to add to Nina's worries, so she kept her resignation a secret and simply said, "I've already asked Mr. Landon for a day off. It's fine."

Â 

As soon as she finished speaking, herÂ phone rang.

Â 

"I'll take this call." Isabella took her phone and went to the balcony.

Â 

It was Kelsey on the line, sounding anxious from the start. "Isabella, what happened? Why did you suddenly resign?"

Â 

Isabella had few friends, butÂ her only friend, Samantha, had betrayed her deeply.

Â 

Since then, Isabella no longer believed in friendship.

Â 

In a true sense, Kelsey wasn't really her friend, just a colleague.

Â 

But the fact that Kelsey calledÂ at this moment did touch Isabella.Â "I'm fine.Â I resigned for personal reasonsÂ andÂ it's not convenient to explain."

Â 

"Is it because of the food poisoning incident?" Kelsey asked because that was what everyone in the office had been saying.

Â 

"No,"Â said Isabella.

Â 

"That's good. Are you free tonight? I want to see you,"Â asked Kelsey.

Â 

"Do you have something to discuss?" Isabella primarily wanted to stay with Nina; given Nina's current state, Isabella felt she could only rest easy by staying close.

Â 

"It's nothing special." Kelsey said, "I justÂ want to talk to you aboutÂ something in person."

Â 

"Okay." Isabella agreed and gave her an address close to the hospital.

Â 

At sixÂ o'clockÂ in the evening, Isabella arrived at the agreed restaurant.

Â 

As she entered, Kelsey, already seated, waved cheerfully at her. "Isabella, over here!"

Â 

Isabella walked over quickly.Â "You got here early?"

Â 

"I justÂ got here a couple of minutes ago." Kelsey poured her a glass of warm water.Â "I'm free anyway, so it's no problem waiting for you."

Â 

Isabella took a seat.

Â 

They ordered a few dishes. Kelsey started the conversation.Â "Why did you suddenly resign? Sebastian hasn't been smiling since you left the company."

Â 

Isabella choked at Kelsey's statement.

Â 

Resting her chin on her hand, Kelsey stared at her intently. "Did you resign because ofÂ Seb?"

Â 

"No!"Â Isabella denied.

Â 

Raising an eyebrow, Kelsey asked, "You answered so quicklyÂ without even thinking?"

Â 

Feeling awkward, Isabella replied, "I resigned to find a better job, soÂ it has nothing to do with Mr. Landon."

Â 

"Have you found a better job?"Â asked Kelsey.

Â 

"Not yet."Â Isabella did not conceal the truth.

Â 

"Then that reason doesn't hold up,"Â saidÂ Kelsey.

###chapter 101 Pregnant Woman Jumps off Building

"You promised to arrange for a driver to drive me back; why did you involve Seb?" Before Sebastian could respond, Isabella waved her hands. "No need to trouble Mr. Landon; I'll just take a taxi back." With that, she quickly slipped away.

Â 

Originally, she still held a glimmer of hope, thinking that maybe the taxi from earlier hadn't left yet, and she could catch that taxiÂ back to the hospital.

Â 

But when she ran out, she realized that the yard outside was empty.Â That taxi had long disappeared.

Â 

Isabella opened the ride-hailing appÂ andÂ sent out an order, but after three minutes, no taxis were available.

Â 

That was how it was in wealthy neighborhoods; it was quite inconvenient.

Â 

Isabella started walking down the road and had only gone about a hundred feet when she heard a car behind her.

Â 

Then, the car stopped right in front of her.Â Sebastian was in the car, saying, "Get in."

Â 

Isabella shook her head.Â "No need, Mr. Landon.Â I can hail a cab."

Â 

Sebastian furrowed his brows slightly.Â "Don't overthink it.Â It was Mr. Jose's request. His family driver is off today, and it's not right to trouble the driver to make a round trip just forÂ youÂ along the way."

Â 

With the conversation reaching this point, if Isabella continued to refuse, she would seem overly dramatic.

Â 

After hesitating for a few seconds, Isabella opened the back door and got into the car.

Â 

As soon as she settled in, Sebastian asked, "Going to Harvar University?"

Â 

"No. To the hospital,"Â said Isabella.

Â 

"Okay." Sebastian didn't ask anything else, stepped on the gas, and the car drove forward.

Â 

Music played in the car, Sebastian remained silent throughout the journey, while Isabella kept looking out the window.

Â 

The two didn't exchange a word.

Â 

As the car arrived at the entrance to the hospital ward, a crowd of people could be seen in the distance.

Â 

Police car lights were flashing.

Â 

Isabella's heart inexplicably tightened. As soon as the car stopped, she quickly got out.Â "Mr. Landon, thank you for taking me back. Goodbye."

Â 

Then she hurriedly ran towards the commotion.

Â 

The onlookers were lively, pointing and gesturing upwards.

Â 

The entrance to the hospital department was cordoned off, and paramedics were urgently setting up air cushions.

Â 

Isabella grabbed a middle-aged woman and asked, "What's happening here?"

Â 

The woman pointed to the rooftop.Â "A pregnant woman is about to jump off!"

Â 

"Yes, it seems she was beaten by her husband, coincidentally pregnant, asked for a divorce, and the husband disagreed. She couldn't bear it for a moment."

Â 

'Beaten by her husband, coincidentally pregnant, asked for a divorce but the husband disagreed.'Â Upon hearing this, Isabella's heart sank.Â These characteristics resembled Nina.

Â 

But when she left, Nina seemed quite stable emotionally, so sheÂ didn't think Nina would do something like this.

Â 

She dialed Nina's phone.

Â 

But it rang for a long time, and no one answered.

Â 

A scream erupted from the crowd.Â The figure standing on the edge of the building seemed to sway a couple of times, on the verge of falling.

Â 

"Sis!" Isabella couldn't remain calm, clutching her phone.Â She headed towards the hospital entrance.

Â 

But she was stopped by a police officer at the entrance.Â "What are you doing?Â Don't you know the situation here?"

Â 

"That person upstairs is my sister.Â Let me in.Â I need to see her." Isabella was somewhat agitated.

Â 

"Your sister?" The officer was momentarily puzzled.

Â 

At that moment, a pair of large hands reached out, firmly grasping Isabella's shoulders, providing her with the support she needed, and preventing her from collapsing.

Â 

Isabella turned her head and saw Sebastian.Â He glanced at her, then said to the officer, "Let us go up.Â The person involved only has this one sister, maybe she can persuade her."

Â 

The officer nodded and sent someone to escort them upstairs.

Â 

As the elevator ascended, Isabella kept dialing Nina's phone, but it continued to go unanswered.Â SheÂ was on the verge of breaking down.

Â 

The hospital had a total of 32 floors, and the elevator couldn't go directly to the top floor. It took them up to the 31st floor, and they still had to climb one flight of stairs to get to the top.

Â 

Perhaps due to extreme nervousness and fear, Isabella's legs were trembling so badly that she couldn't take a step, despite holding onto the handrail.

Â 

Sebastian stood beside her for a moment, then bent down directly, carrying her up in his arms.

Â 

Isabella looked at him in surprise, but he didn't meet her gaze, carrying her swiftly.Â He rushed up to the rooftop.

Â 

A gust of cold wind hit them.

Â 

Sebastian set her down and then took off his coat, draping it over Isabella's shoulders.

Â 

"Bella?" Nina and two police officers stood together.Â When Nina saw Isabella, a hint of surprise appeared on her pale face.

Â 

"Sis!" Isabella almost ran over, embracing Nina.Â "Why are you so foolish?Â No matter what, you can't leave me alone."

Â 

SheÂ burst into tears.Â A profound fear enveloped her like a thick shadow, making it hard for her to catch her breath.

Â 

Nina was momentarily stunned, patting her back to comfort her.Â "Is there a misunderstanding? It's not me who was going to jump."

Â 

Tears streamed down Isabella's face.Â "It's really not you?"

Â 

"No."Â Just as Nina was about to explain, a police officer approached her, saying, "HeÂ is very agitated and insists on talking to you."

Â 

At that moment, a familiar voice could be heard not far away.

Â 

"Nina, I'll count to ten.Â If you don't come to see me, I'll jump from here."

Â 

Isabella widened her eyes in shock.Â "Is it Charlie?"Â The person about to jump off the building was actually Charlie!

Â 

"Ten!"

Â 

"Nine!"

Â 

Nina furrowed her brows.Â "I'm coming."

Â 

As she tried to move forward, Isabella quickly grabbed her.Â "Sis."

Â 

Nina patted her hand, reassuring her.Â "The officers will protect me. Don't worry."

Â 

How could Isabella not worry?Â "Sis, you must take care of yourself.Â I can't be without you."

Â 

She wasn't afraid that Charlie would fall, she was afraid that Charlie would go crazy and drag Nina to death with him.

Â 

Nina nodded.Â "Don't worry.Â I'll be fine."Â She turned to Sebastian.Â "Mr. Landon, please take care of my sister Isabella."

Â 

Sebastian nodded.Â "Don't worry."

Â 

The wind on the rooftop was strong, with only those few red-lit words.Â There was no other light shining over.

Â 

Amidst the sound of the wind, Isabella couldn't make out the conversation over there.

Â 

She bit her lip and walked a short distance forward.

Â 

The officer reminded her, "You're standing too close, it's not convenient for us to carry out the rescue."

Â 

Standing there, she could already see Nina and Charlie holding onto the railing.

Â 

"Nina, you finally agreed to see me." Charlie cried.Â "Have you forgiven me?"

Â 

Nina frowned.Â "Come down first."

Â 

CharlieÂ said, "I know I've wronged you.Â I shouldn't have laid a hand on you.Â I'm not a good husband. But Nina, if I have to watch you abort our child, it's better for me to die. If I die, can you at least spare his life and continue our family line?"

Â 

"ItÂ is not the time for this discussion.Â Come down first, and we can sit down and talk properly,"Â said Nina.

Â 

Charlie stood on the edge of the railing, half of his body hanging over the void, only his hands gripping the rusty railing.Â His current situation was undoubtedly dangerous.

Â 

With tears in his eyes, Charlie looked at her.Â "I know I've made a huge mistake. If you won't turn back, I can only atone for my sins with death. When I die, you must live well with the child."

Upon Saying that, Charlie suddenly let go of one hand, with most of his body hanging over the edge.

###chapter 100 Heartbreak

Isabella didn't expect Kelsey to be such a logical genius.

Â 

"Honestly, is it because of the child?" Kelsey looked puzzled.Â "I always thought the child was Sebastian's, but it turnedÂ out it's not his?"

Â 

Isabella replied, "I don't think I ever said the child was Mr. Landon's?"

Â 

So she couldn't understand how Kelsey had come to her conclusion.

Â 

"You didn't say it outright, but the way Sebastian dotes on you and the child was enough for me to suspect," said Kelsey.

Â 

Isabella asked, "Mr. Landon cares about me and the child?"

Â 

KelseyÂ said, "Yes. You might not be aware, but during that time, the cafeteria reduced meal prices, wages were paid early, and extra snacks were added to the water cooler-all of these were specifically arranged by Sebastian for your benefit.Â He knew you were short on money and was afraid you weren't eating well, so he had the cafeteria meals discounted for you. Haven't you noticed that every time you got food, the portions were doubled?

Â 

"ForÂ the early paychecks, do you know how much the finance department complained about that adjustment?Â As for the snacks in the water cooler, because I mentioned that you like sour things, he immediately arranged for them.Â For you, he really didn't think too muchÂ andÂ just did whatever he wanted to do. He onlyÂ cared about whether he was treating you well, but didn't careÂ aboutÂ what others said or thought.

Â 

"Isabella, I've known Sebastian for so many years, and I've never seen him so concerned about any woman. So when you resigned, I immediately went to ask him. I thought he was being wishy-washy about you, but he told me the child wasn't his. Do you know how shocked I was?Â If the child wereÂ his, he would probably have given you the whole world, maybe even some very precious things!"

Â 

Isabella's heart stirred, and her fingers on the table slowly curled up.

Â 

If Sebastian knew the child was his, he would definitely be very happy.

Â 

She knew everything Kelsey said.Â Sebastian was indeed overly good to her, but that couldn't be a reason for her to ruin someone else's relationship.

Â 

One must have boundaries in life, especially since everything was an accident from the beginning. Isabella never thought about making Sebastian responsible.

Â 

The dishes and drinks arrived.

Â 

Kelsey ordered wine for herself and orange juice for Isabella.

Â 

As she spoke, she poured herself wine.

Â 

Seeing more than a dozen empty wine bottles, Isabella reached out to stop her.Â "Don't drink anymore."

Â 

But Kelsey waved her hand.Â "It's fine."Â She thenÂ ordered more from the waiter.

Â 

Isabella looked at her.Â "Are you heartbroken?"

Â 

As if struck by an arrow to her heart, Kelsey paused, burped from the wine, and then slammed the bottle down heavily. "Isabella, am I not pretty enough?"

Â 

"You're quite beautiful," Isabella replied seriously.

Â 

Kelsey directly took off her coat, revealing the black camisole underneath, and pushingÂ up her chest.Â "Is it because my figure isn't good enough?"

Â 

Isabella glanced and blushed a bit.Â "It's quite good."Â She thought Kelsey would be happy with her answers.

Â 

But instead, Kelsey slumped despondently on the table, crying.Â "Then why doesn't heÂ like me?"

Â 

Isabella fell silent.Â "Are you talking about Mr. Landon?"

Â 

Kelsey shook her head.Â "That's in the past."

Â 

"And now?"Â Isabella was somewhat puzzled.

Â 

"He's a jerk!"Â Kelsey had drunk too much, sounding a bit incoherent.Â "He's quite average-looking, average physique, no background. Just because he touched my chest, I asked him to take responsibility. Isn't that reasonable? But he refused me. Why does he have the right to refuse me? It's the first time in my life a man has touched my chest."

Â 

Her loud voiceÂ and her excited state attracted the attention of the nearby diners, who turned to look.

Â 

IsabellaÂ who wasÂ alarmed, covered her mouth.Â "Ms. Jose, please don't say such things."

Â 

After that, Kelsey didn't say anything inappropriateÂ but just cried continuously.

Â 

Isabella couldn't bear to see her so sad, so she asked, "How about I call Jack?"

Â 

Kelsey cried.Â "No, don't call him. I don't want to see him."

Â 

After a moment, Kelsey said, "You call himÂ andÂ tell him I've had too much to drink. Ask him to come pick me up. Let's see what he says."

Â 

Isabella smiled at the insincere Kelsey.

Â 

Under Kelsey's hopeful gaze, Isabella dialed Jack's number and put it on speaker so Kelsey could hear too.

Â 

After a few rings, the call was answered, and Jack's voice came through.Â "Isabella, why are you calling me at this hour?Â Is something wrong?"

Â 

"Well, there's a bit of an issue.Â Do you have time now?"Â asked Isabella.

Â 

"I just left the office. What's up?"

Â 

Isabella continued,Â "Ms. Jose has drank a lotÂ and keeps mentioning you. Can you come and pick her up?"

Â 

There was silence on the other end.Â Kelsey looked eagerly at Isabella's phone, lips pressed tightly.

Â 

Then Jack said, "I'll call Mr. Jose."

Â 

Tears welled up in Kelsey's eyes, she picked up her phone, turned off the speaker, held it to her ear, and said, "Don't bother. Mr. Jack, I'm not drunk.Â I can go back on my own."

Â 

After hanging up, Kelsey slumped in her chair, tears streaming down her face.

Â 

Isabella watched, feeling helpless. At that moment, no words could comfort her, so she could only silently accompany her.

Â 

Later, Kelsey went to the restroom and vomited three times. When Isabella sent KelseyÂ off in the car, she was completely unconscious from the alcohol.

Â 

In this situation, Isabella couldn't just send her back in a taxi, so she had to personally escort her back to the Jose manor.

Â 

Isabella didn't expect to encounter Sebastian there.

Â 

As she and the Jose family's servants helped Kelsey into the house, Sebastian and Zaire happened to come down from upstairs together.

Â 

"How did it come to this?" Zaire, dressed in white, looked gentle and clean. He wrinkled his nose at the smell of alcohol on Kelsey.

Â 

Isabella explained, "Ms. Jose wasÂ in a bad mood and had a few too many drinks."

Â 

Zaire had the servants take Kelsey to her room, then turned to Isabella.Â "I really appreciate youÂ bringingÂ her backÂ personally. How much is the taxi fare?Â I'll reimburse you."

Â 

"No need." Isabella waved her hand.Â "It's not much money. If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave."

Â 

Zaire stopped her.Â "It's late. Since you're a young girl, I'm also worried. I'll have a driver take you home."

Â 

Isabella thought, she didn't have much money left anyway, and the Jose family had plenty of drivers, so she didn't need to be polite with Zaire.Â So she nodded.Â "Thank you ."

Â 

"No trouble at all." Zaire smiled, his hand falling on Sebastian's shoulder.Â "Besides, Mr. Landon is also heading back. So he can take you back."

Â 

Â 

  ###chapter 102 Concern for Me

Screams came from downstairs, one after another.

Â 

"Charlie!" Nina screamed and fell to the ground.Â She was probably scared too.

Â 

Charlie turned to look at her but remained silent.

Â 

After a long pause, Nina said, "Come down. I promise you.Â We won't get rid of this child."

Â 

"Nina, are you really willing to keep our child? Are you willing to give me a chance, to forgive me?" Charlie asked.

Â 

Nina nodded wearily.Â "You come down first."

Â 

"Okay. I'm coming down now," Charlie said as he withdrew his hand.

Â 

The police officers lurking around also moved forward to pull him up.

Â 

But at that moment, the rusty railing suddenly broke with a crisp sound.

Â 

Charlie's hand lost support, and he was thrown out.

Â 

The suddenÂ accidentÂ terrified CharlieÂ but he was lucky becauseÂ the officers caught his arm in time.

Â 

What fell down was just a piece of rust.

Â 

Charlie turned back, looking at the rust that fell.Â He wasÂ relieved that it wasn't him falling, or he would have turned into a puddle of flesh by now.

Â 

After being pulled up by the officers, Charlie staggered to Nina and hugged her, crying loudly.

Â 

After the commotion, everyone returned to the hospital room.

Â 

Nina sat on the bed, trembling despite being covered with a blanket and the room being heated.Â Her faceÂ wasÂ pale and bloodless.

Â 

Charlie poured a cup of hot water attentivelyÂ for her.Â "Nina, here, have some hot water to warm up."

Â 

As the cup was handed to Nina, Isabella brushed it aside.Â "You leave!"

Â 

Charlie was taken aback.Â "Bella, I know I was wrong, but your sister has forgiven me."

Â 

"Who said my sister forgave you?" Isabella's face turned pale with anger.

Â 

Clearly, this was Charlie's tactic.

Â 

Charlie counted on Nina's soft heart.Â NinaÂ couldn't bear to watch himself die in front of her, so he staged this scene.

Â 

Isabella felt sickened for Nina.Â She didn't allow Charlie to get close to Nina and protected her vigilantly.

Â 

Unable to stay longer, Charlie had to leave after a moment.

Â 

As he walked out of the room, Charlie saw Sebastian.Â CharlieÂ approachedÂ himÂ with a smile, took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, and offered one.Â "Mr. Landon, care for a smoke?"

Â 

Sebastian shook his head.

Â 

SeeingÂ CharlieÂ about to light up, Sebastian said, "This is a hospital."

Â 

Charlie was taken aback.

Â 

Sebastian frowned slightly.Â "Smoking is prohibited."

Â 

Charlie took the cigarette out of his mouth and put it back in the pack.Â "I forgot."

Â 

Sebastian looked at him coldly.Â "Did you cause the injuries on Nina's face?"

Â 

Charlie was surprised again, not giving a direct answer but trying to excuse himself.Â "This isn't solely my fault. It's normal for couples to have arguments."

Â 

Sebastian sneered, "Putting someone in the hospital is normal?"

Â 

Charlie could sense that Mr. Landon held a significant grudge against him.Â "I admit I may have been too harsh. But Mr. Landon, as a man, you should understand my situation. Nina stays at home all day, only doing household chores without earning money. I work alone, supporting my wife,Â andÂ paying the mortgage. I wasÂ under a lot of pressure."

Â 

Sebastian watched Charlie's acting expressionlessly, waiting for him to finish before debunking his story. "I remember Nina used to work and earned quite a decent income last year. Why did she suddenly give it up?"

Â 

Charlie choked up.

Â 

Since Sebastian could say these things, it meant he knew quite a bit. He probably even understood the reasons why Nina suddenly stopped working for money.

Â 

The image Charlie tried so hard to maintain had completely crumbled in front of Sebastian.

Â 

Especially since Sebastian was someone he couldn't afford to offend, Charlie gave an awkward laugh and said, "I forgot, how could someone as high and mighty as Mr. Landon ever understand us commoners?"

Â 

As they conversed, Isabella emerged.Â She held a hot water bottle, seemingly going to fetch hot water.

Â 

Upon seeing Charlie, her wariness immediately surfaced.Â "Why are you still here?"

Â 

"I'm leaving soon." Charlie didn't bother to pretend anymore. After being reprimanded by Sebastian, he felt annoyed and left without saying another word.

Â 

Only then did Isabella turn to Sebastian.Â "Mr. Landon, thank you for escorting me back."

Â 

If he wasn't there, Isabella felt she couldn't even make it to the rooftop.

Â 

Strangely, with him around, Isabella felt a sense of security, as if someone had her back even in times of trouble.

Â 

Sebastian walked over, took the hot water bottle from herÂ without saying a word,Â and headed towards the water cooler.

Â 

Isabella hesitated for a moment, then followed.

Â 

By the water cooler, Sebastian was already there, pouring hot water.

Â 

His posture was upright, his shoulders broad, exuding a noble air even while pouring water.

Â 

Isabella approached and whispered, "Let me do it."

Â 

Suddenly, Sebastian turned his head and asked, "Why did you resign?"

Â 

The topic changed too quickly, causing Isabella's mind to blank for a few seconds.

Â 

During those moments, the hot water quickly filled the container. Seeing it about to overflow, Isabella hurriedly reached to turn off the tap.

Â 

But she was a bit late, and some hot water spilled, flowing over Sebastian's hand.

Â 

A visible red burn mark appeared on Sebastian's hand.

Â 

"Let's rinse it with cold water first." Isabella took the hot water bottle and placed it aside, then, in a rush, she grabbed his wrist and led him to the nearby cold water sink.

Â 

Turning on the tap, she continuously rinsedÂ Sebastian's scalded hand with cold water.

Â 

Sebastian's hand remained red.

Â 

"This won't do. I'll go downstairs to buy burn cream." She turned to leave, but Sebastian grabbed her wrist.

Â 

He pulled her back, gazing steadily into her eyes.Â "You concerned about me?"

Â 

Isabella hesitated.Â "Your hand is more important."

Â 

Sebastian didn't release her hand.Â "Answer my previous question first."

Â 

He stared at her intensely as if trying to see through her.

Â 

Isabella avoided his gaze at first, then blinked and said, "It's not concern.Â It's responsibility. You got burnedÂ becauseÂ helping me with the hot water, so I should take responsibility."

Â 

"I was referring to the earlier question!"Â SebÂ said.

Â 

'Why did I suddenly quit my job? How can I answer this question in a way that sounds natural and doesn't raise suspicion?' Isabella was still racking her brains for an answer when the pressure on her wrist suddenly disappeared.

Â 

Sebastian released his grip and said calmly, "Forget it."

Â 

Isabella felt a pang of emptiness inside.

Â 

He turned off the tap and regained his usual calm composure. "I've already approved your resignation report, Isabella. I hope you find happiness. If you encounter any trouble in the future that you can't handle, you can seek Jack's help.Â He might be able to assist you."

Â 

Isabella felt a pang in her heart, nodding, still keeping her head down without looking at him.

Â 

After a moment, Sebastian left.

Â 

Isabella was left alone by the water cooler. She staredÂ at the hot water bottle and was lost in thought for a long time.

 ###chapter 103 Gentle Eyes

That night, Isabella slept on the accompanyingÂ bed.

Â 

She dreamed all night.Â In her dreams, it was all about conversations at the water cooler, the words Sebastian said to her. It was messy.Â She was unable to grasp the main points, entangling her in mental exhaustion.

Â 

Nina leaned over to look at her.Â "Bella?"

Â 

Isabella propped herself up with her hand and sat up.Â "Sis."

Â 

"Do you have something on your mind?" Nina asked with concern.

Â 

Isabella shook her head.Â "No."Â But she still sat on the bed for quite a while.

Â 

It wasn't until Charlie brought breakfast that Isabella got up to wash up in the bathroom.

Â 

When she came out, Charlie was feeding soup to Nina.

Â 

"Bella, I made a bowl of soup for you too. Drink it while it's hot." Charlie smiled.

Â 

Isabella took her coat and wrapped it around herself, indifferently saying, "No need."

Â 

She walked to the bedside and said to Nina, "Sis, I'm going to the company.Â I'll come to see you tonight."

Â 

"Okay, take care,"Â said Nina.

Â 

Isabella would haveÂ several interviews today, but before that, she had to go for a check-up.

Â 

When the doctor called her number, she knocked on the door and entered the examination room.

Â 

Unexpectedly, the previous patient hadn't finished the examination yet. Separated by a curtain, the doctor asked her to wait for a while.

Â 

SheÂ sat down on a chair and waited.

Â 

After a moment, a very familiar voice came from behind the curtain.Â "I should be fine, right?"

Â 

Isabella froze.

Â 

That voice soundedÂ so much like Samantha.

Â 

"Because you had an abortion before, which led to the thinning of the uterine wall. The embryo didn't implant securely at the beginning, and now there's bleeding. The situation is not optimistic,"Â said the doctor.

Â 

"You must save my child. This child is too important to me.Â There must be no mishaps!" Samantha urged anxiously.

Â 

The doctor sighed.Â "I can only do my best."

Â 

As they spoke, the curtain was pulled back, and the doctor and Samantha walked out one after the other.

Â 

Seeing Isabella, Samantha's face turnedÂ pale.Â "Isabella, were you eavesdropping outside just now?"

Â 

Isabella looked at her calmly.Â "Don't worry.Â I didn't hear anything."

Â 

The doctor prescribed medication for Samantha, instructing her to take it on time and come to the hospital immediately if she felt unwell.

Â 

It sounded quite serious.

Â 

Since the last time Isabella saw Samantha at the Landon family, it had been a long time, and Isabella hadn't seen her sinceÂ that time.

Â 

Seeing Samantha dressed in designer clothes, wearing a gold necklace around her neck, and thick gold bracelets on her wrists, she looked very extravagant. It seemed like she was living a comfortable life accepted by Charles and Emma.

Â 

No wonder Samantha was so nervous about this child.Â After all, if anything happened to the child, everything she had now would disappear.

Â 

"Thank you, doctor." Samantha took the prescription and glanced at Isabella before leaving.

Â 

When Isabella finished her check-up and came out, Samantha was still waiting for her outside, holding the prescription.Â "Isabella, I have something to tell you."

Â 

Isabella interrupted her, "I know what you want to say. Don't worry.Â I didn't hear anything inside."

Â 

She tried to leave, but Samantha stopped her.Â "I don't believe you."

Â 

Isabella frowned.Â "Believe it or not.Â It's up to you."

Â 

She rudely shook off Samantha's hand, turned around, and went up the stairs.

Â 

"Isabella, stop!" Samantha called after her.

Â 

Isabella turned around and saw Samantha catching up.

Â 

She quickened her pace and soon left Samantha behind.

Â 

Samantha descended the stairsÂ andÂ looked around, but Isabella's figure was nowhere to be seen.

Â 

This floor happened to be the operating room. Samantha seriously suspected whether Isabella had entered here, so she searched around.

Â 

At this moment, the door of the operating room opened, and medical staff wheeled out a stretcher bed. Samantha casually glanced over and then widened her eyes. "Vanessa?"

Â 

Vanessa had just undergone artificial insemination surgery and was feeling a bit uncomfortable at the moment, adjusting with her eyes closed.

Â 

Samantha's exclamation almost scared VanessaÂ out of her wits.Â "Samantha?"

Â 

"Vanessa, how did you come out of the operating room?" Samantha followed the stretcher bed, even looking back inÂ the direction of the operating room in surprise.

Â 

Vanessa squeezed out a smile.Â "I had a minor surgery."

Â 

"You were alone?" Samantha was surprised.Â "Mr. Landon didn't accompany you?"

Â 

VanessaÂ said, "He's busy with workÂ so I didn't tell him."

Â 

"Okay."Â As the stretcher bed was pushed into the elevator, Samantha thought for a moment and followed inside.

Â 

Vanessa's facial expression seemed uncomfortable.Â "Samantha."

Â 

"Vanessa, how can you be alone in the hospital? It's somewhat inconvenient. I have nothing to do anyway.Â I'll accompany you,"Â said Samantha.

Â 

"No need. It's a minor surgery for me. I'll be able to go home after a few hours of observation. Don't waste your time staying with me here."Â Despite Vanessa's words, she was clearly trying to get Samantha to leave.

Â 

Samantha, however, looked puzzled and asked, "Vanessa, what kind of surgery is this? You don't need to stay in the hospital for anti-inflammatory treatmentÂ andÂ you can go home directly?"

Â 

Before Vanessa could answer, the elevator arrived.

Â 

The door opened, and Samantha saw twoÂ big words, "Reproductive Medicine".

Â 

Vanessa couldn't hide it anymore and had to tell Samantha the truth.

Â 

"Artificial insemination?" Samantha was puzzled.Â "You and Mr. Landon are in your prime, why artificial insemination?"

Â 

"It's because of my body. I had to resort to this method due to some reasons. Samantha, this matter concerns Sebastian's reputation, I hope you won't spread it around."

Â 

"Don't worry.Â I won't tell anyone."Â Samantha promised.

Â 

Although she promised solemnly, Vanessa was still worried.

Â 

After observing in the hospital for a few hours, Vanessa made an excuse for Samantha to take her home.

Â 

After they arrived home, Vanessa took Samantha to the cloakroomÂ andÂ gave her two sets of clothes and a set of jewelry.

Â 

Samantha happily returned to the Landon family with the gifts.

Â 

Emma was gardening.

Â 

"Hi, Emma." Samantha entered and greeted her cheerfully.

Â 

Emma frowned, showing no joy on her face.Â Seeing the bag in Samantha'sÂ hand, she asked, "Did you go shopping again?"

Â 

Samantha hurriedly explained, "No. These were given to me by my sister-in-law."

Â 

"Sister-in-law, you mean Vanessa?"Â Emma asked.

Â 

"Yes." Samantha thought of Vanessa's artificial insemination and said, "It seems like sheÂ is pregnant."

Â 

Emma was somewhat surprised, and her expression softened a bit.Â "That's also a good thing. Sebastian has some opinions about me and Matthew. If you can get along well with Vanessa, it will be a credit to our family."

Â 

SamanthaÂ said, "Rest assured.Â I get along very well with her."

Â 

"Good."

Â 

After going upstairs, Samantha hung up the clothes, put away the jewelry, and then secretly took out the medication prescribed by the doctor and took two pills.

Â 

The pills got stuck in her throat when a knock sounded at the door.

Â 

Samantha opened the doorÂ whenÂ Matthew stood there with a cup of hot milk, he said, "For you."

Â 

"I already had some this morning."

Â 

"This was made by me. Are you sure you don't want it?" Matthew's gaze was gentle, but upon closer inspection, that gentleness didn't reach his eyes.

Â 

"But I really don't like milk."Â Since Samantha became pregnant, she had become quite sensitive to the taste of milk.

Â 

But the doctor said that drinking milk was good for the child.

Â 

For this reason, Matthew arranged for her to have a cup of hot milk with every meal, even before bed.Â He watched her drink it every time.

Â 

Samantha enjoyed this care, but it also made her physically uncomfortable.

###chapter 104 Saving Him

At this moment, Samantha really couldn't drink it, so she said, "Let's put it aside. I'll drink it later."

Â 

Matthew frowned. "If it gets cold, you won't be able to drink it. Don't you want our child to be healthy?"

Â 

Samantha hesitated for a moment, but finally, sheÂ didn't want to disappoint Matthew.

Â 

"Okay." She took the cup with both hands, furrowed her brow, and poured a cup of hot milk down.

Â 

Matthew took the empty cup and looked at it, then raised his eyebrows.Â "Isn't this better?"

Â 

Seeing him smile, Samantha took the opportunity to make a request.Â "Matthew, the weather is so nice today. Let's go out for a walk. You said you'd take me to the park last time, and I've been waiting for a long time."

Â 

"Next time," Matthew said.Â "Today I neededÂ to go to the company with Dad."

Â 

Disappointed, Samantha pursed her lips.Â "Alright, make sure to come back early in the evening then."

Â 

"Okay." Matthew reached outÂ andÂ ruffled her hair.Â "Take a nap in the afternoon. The doctor said getting more sleep is good for the baby's development."

Â 

As soon as he mentioned it, Samantha yawned.Â "I am a bit tired. I don't know what's wrong recently.Â I feel very sleepy."

Â 

She had just gotten up a few hours ago, and now she felt like sleeping again.

Â 

Matthew's eyes softened.Â "Go to sleep first. I'll instruct the maid to bring lunch up for you."

Â 

"Okay." Samantha turned around and went to sleep.

Â 

Matthew watched her climb into bed.Â In no time, SamanthaÂ drifted off to sleep.

Â 

He stood at the door for a moment before closing it and heading downstairs.

Â 

Emma was still in the living room tending to her plant. When she saw him coming downstairs, she asked, "Where's Samantha?"

Â 

"She's sleeping,"Â answered Matthew.

Â 

"Sleeping?" Emma paused, somewhat puzzled.Â "Why is she so sleepy lately?"

Â 

"Pregnant women tend to be a bit like that," Matthew replied nonchalantly.

Â 

He walked to the side, used the empty milk cup to fetch some water, and poured it into the plant's soil.

Â 

The water seeped into the soil and quickly disappeared. However, some tiny white granular objects remained attached to the surface of the soil, unable to sink.

Â 

"What's this?" Emma dipped her gloved handÂ into it, picked some up, and examined it carefully in front of her eyes.

Â 

Matthew glanced at it, a hint of nervousness fleeting across his face.Â "It might be milk residue."

Â 

"Our milk is delivered fresh, how could there be milk residue like this?" Emma, a former chemistry professor, was quick to notice that this wasn't milk residue.

Â 

The color and texture were not quite right.

Â 

Emma dipped her fingers in it, rubbed them together, and then brought them to her nose for a sniff. Her expression changed dramatically in an instant. She turned to look at Matthew. "Tell me the truth, what exactly is this?"

Â 

"It's just milk residue." Matthew took off her gloves, threw them directly into the trash can, and then went into the kitchen to rinse the milk cup several times.

Â 

Emma followed, standing at the doorway, witnessing his series of actions, suddenly understanding.Â "Did you put a sedative in Samantha's milk?"

Â 

Matthew remained composed, after placing the cup back, he wiped his hands.Â "Mom, you're overthinking.Â It's just milk residue."

Â 

Emma rushed over, grabbingÂ his hand.Â "Doing this will harm the child in Samantha's belly."

Â 

Matthew remained calm.Â "Mom, you taught me that if something shouldn't come into this world, then don't let it. I don't like the child in Samantha's bellyÂ andÂ his birth will only be a tragedy.Â I'm saving him."

Â 

"Matthew!" Emma's expression was shocked.Â "When did IÂ teach you these things?"

Â 

Matthew just smiled slightly.Â "YouÂ forgotÂ thatÂ back then when Dad had an affair, the woman outside got pregnant.Â You did the same."

Â 

Emma was suddenly stunned.

Â 

At that time, Matthew was only seven or eight years old.

Â 

When Charles had an affair outside, the woman came with a pregnancy test report.

Â 

Emma arranged for the woman to stay in a villa in the suburbs and had someone take care of her.

Â 

But half a month later, the woman had a miscarriage.

Â 

That time, Matthew watched her put abortion pills in the woman's soup.

Â 

Matthew asked, "Mom, what are you doing?"

Â 

Emma hugged him and said, "Matthew, everyone makes mistakes in this world. Your dad made a mistake this time, that child shouldn't be born. Since it's destined to be a tragedy, it's better not to let the childÂ come into this world. Mom is saving him."

Â 

It had been so long since that incident, Emma had forgotten all about it.

Â 

She never expected that Matthew had kept it in his heart all this time.

Â 

And now, he was imitating it in a way.

Â 

This made Emma feel very frightened.

Â 

Isabella had been interviewing all day.Â When the last one ended, she received a call from Emma.

Â 

EmmaÂ asked if she was available to meet.

Â 

Sensing something from her tone, Isabella said she was available.

Â 

Emma then asked where she was at the moment.

Â 

Isabella gave her the addressÂ and then Emma asked her to wait there, saying she was nearby.

Â 

After a few minutes, Emma's car pulled up where Isabella was waiting.

Â 

Half an hour later, the two sat down at a high-end restaurant.

Â 

"Bella, what do you want to eat?Â Feel free to order, myÂ treat." Emma handed her the menu, smiling, but her eyes constantlyÂ carried a heavy burden.

Â 

"In that case, I won't be polite." Isabella took the menuÂ andÂ ordered a few dishes and two drinks.

Â 

Emma looked at her and smiled.Â "It's only been a few days since we last met, why do you look thinner again? Is work very hard?"

Â 

"It's okay." Isabella didn't mention her job search.Â "You suddenly contacted me.Â Is there something going on?"

Â 

Emma sighed.Â "Bella, I heard that you and Samantha used to be good friends, but things got sour because of Matthew's affair?"

Â 

"Yes. But that's all in the past.Â I've let it goÂ andÂ you don't have to worry about it."

Â 

Emma nodded, still feeling a bit regretful.Â "To be honest, Charles and I both quite like you.Â It's just a pity that Matthew is clueless and made a mistake. Since he made a mistake, we have to take responsibility. Moreover, Samantha is still carrying our family's child in her belly. As long as she's not too bad at heart, Charles and I can accept her."

Â 

Emma ponderedÂ and asked, "Bella, can IÂ ask you for a favor?"

Â 

"Sure, what is it?"Â said Isabella.

Â 

"Do you have time tomorrow? Can you go home to check on Samantha?"Â asked Emma.

Â 

Isabella looked at her in surprise.Â "Even though I've moved on, Samantha and Matthew hurt me first. I can't possibly interact with them again."

Â 

"I understand." Emma looked troubled.

Â 

"Is something wrong?" Isabella's question made Emma's eyes instantly turn red.

Â 

She stood up and came over, taking Isabella's hands in her own, which were cold to the touch. "Bella, please help Matthew. If this continues, I'm really afraid he might do something even more foolish."

Â 

 ###chapter 105 Don't Drink

Â Specifically, Emma didn't say what happened.Â She only said that everything would be clear when Isabella went home.

Â 

Finally, Emma held Isabella's hand tightly.Â "Bella, only you can save Matthew."

Â 

Isabella looked at her pitifully and nodded in agreement.

Â 

The next day was Nina's discharge day.Â The injuries on her body hadn't healed yet, especially the bruises on her face.

Â 

When she went home, sheÂ wore a hat and a mask, avoiding neighbors to greet them directly.

Â 

Upon entering the house, Nina was surprised to find that the layout had changed.

Â 

The previously messy house had been tidied up.

Â 

The windows on the balcony were openÂ andÂ there were flowers on the dining table, diluting the medicinal smell in the air.

Â 

Charlie helped Nina change her shoes and said, "I've thrown away those medicines. We have a child now, and we'll never have to drink those again."

Â 

After changing her shoes, he supported Nina with both hands and guided her to the master bedroom door.Â "I've also tidied up the bedroom.Â Please take a look, my dear."

Â 

The changes in the bedroom were significantÂ andÂ everything looked fresh and new.

Â 

Even the bed sheets and pillowcases were brand new, with prints of Nina's favorite tulips.

Â 

Isabella stood behind them, coldly reminding Charlie, "Don't think that doing these things can make up for the domestic violence against my sister. I've kept the videos and photos; if it happens again, even if the child is born, I will personally strangle him."

Â 

Charlie chuckled.Â "You'reÂ usually gentle.Â I didn't expect youÂ to say such harsh words."

Â 

Nina said, "She's just trying to protect me."

Â 

"Yes." Charlie acted like a eunuch.Â "By the way, Bella will graduate in half a month. She probably can't stay in the university dormitory anymore, so I've prepared a room for you."

Â 

Charlie walked to the room where Isabella used to live, opened the door, and found it neat and clean.

Â 

In addition, there was a new computer desk and a computer inside.

Â 

"I remember Bella always wanted a computer. How about this one? If there's anythingÂ missing, just let meÂ know, and I'll take care of it for you."

Â 

If the previous events didn't cause any ripples,Â Charlie's final statement would stir Nina's heart.

Â 

Charlie knew Nina too well. She was indifferent to many things, but whenever Isabella was involved, she would compromise without hesitation.

Â 

Seeing Nina touched, Isabella knew that Charlie had once again found Nina's weakness.

Â 

"I won't move back in," Isabella said.Â Because sheÂ wouldn't let herself become Nina's weakness again.Â "But I will rent a place closer to you, so I can visit my sister often, and she can come to see me too."

Â 

Nina held her hand, her eyes slightly moist.Â She knew Isabella was backing her up.

Â 

Isabella's phone rang, it was Emma asking when she would arrive.

Â 

Isabella replied that she would be there soon.

Â 

When Isabella arrived at the Landon family, Samantha was sunbathing in the yard.Â The sun shone on her, with her eyes half-closed as if dozing off.

Â 

Whether it was the strong sunlight outside or the fact that she wasn't wearing makeup today. HerÂ face looked very pale.

Â 

Isabella walked over and called out, "Samantha?"

Â 

Samantha looked surprised, her gaze somewhat unfocused upon seeing Isabella.

Â 

After a few seconds, she seemed to snap out of it and stood up abruptly.Â "Isabella, why are you here?Â Are you here to complain?"

Â 

Isabella was a bit speechless.Â " Emma invited me."

Â 

"Why did she invite you over?" Samantha asked anxiously, "Did you say something to her? I warn you.Â Don't talk nonsense!"

Â 

Isabella stared at her face, feeling that something was off.Â "Are you sick?"

Â 

"You're the one who's sick.Â I'm fine," Samantha said, pushing Isabella, "You better leave.Â You're not welcome here."

Â 

"Bella, you're here." Emma came out of the house, holding a plate of exquisite pastries.

Â 

Samantha had to stop and gave Isabella a fierce look.

Â 

Emma placed the pastries on a small table.Â "I forgot to bring the fruit platter. Bella, could you please help me get it?"

Â 

She gestured to Isabella with her eyes as she spoke.

Â 

Isabella nodded.Â "Sure."

Â 

She entered the house.

Â 

A servant was waiting at the door, seemingly ready to guide her.Â "Ms. Miller, the kitchen is over there."

Â 

"Okay." Isabella walked in that direction.

Â 

Upon entering the kitchen, Isabella immediately saw a plate of cut fruits.

Â 

As she walked over to pick it up, she caught a glimpse of another figure in the corner of her eye.

Â 

She took a closer look.Â It was Matthew.

Â 

The Landon family's kitchen was quite large, divided into three sections. Isabella was currently in the second section, while Matthew was in the innermost one.

Â 

There was a distance between them, but Isabella still saw him drop two white pills into a glass of milk before stirring it with a spoon.

Â 

After doing this, Matthew turned around with the milk in hand. The moment he saw Isabella, a complex emotion flickered through his eyes.

Â 

But before Isabella could grasp any details, he had already walked over, a faint smile on his face. "Isabella, why are you here?"

Â 

"Emma invited me." Isabella glanced at the milk in his hand.Â "What's this?"

Â 

"Hot milk. IÂ prepared for Samantha."

Â 

Isabella didn't ask further, but the image of him putting pills in the milk kept replaying in her mind.

Â 

They walked out to the yard together.

Â 

Samantha immediately got up and linked arms with Matthew, glaring at Isabella as if declaring her sovereignty.

Â 

"Milk." Matthew handed the milk to Samantha.Â "Drink it while it's hot."

Â 

Seeing the milk, Samantha's expression was indescribable, and she even looked a bit nauseous.Â "I don't feel like drinking it now."

Â 

Matthew's expression turned cold instantly.Â "Suit yourself."

Â 

Emma said,Â "Bella is pregnant too, so she can have it."

Â 

Matthew frowned.Â "No!"

Â 

Samantha felt secretly pleased. This was the first time Matthew had refused to be nice to Isabella for her sake.Â So Samantha felt really happy now. Â 

Â 

But Emma asked, "Why not? It's just a cup of hot milk."

Â 

"This cup is for Samantha. If Isabella wants some, I'll go make another one for her."

Â 

"Matthew." Samantha leaned on his shoulder, exuding happiness. "You're so kind."

Â 

She was deliberately showing off to Isabella.

Â 

And Isabella frowned, her face serious.

Â 

Samantha felt that Isabella must be very jealous at this moment.

Â 

Matthew comforted Samantha, "Go ahead and drink it before it gets cold."

Â 

With that, he brought the cup to Samantha's lips.

Â 

As Samantha smelled it, she felt nauseous and her face turned even paler.

Â 

Â 

Isabella finally sensed that something was wrong, took a step forward, and said, "Since she doesn't want to drink it, let me taste it."

Â 

She reached out to take the cup, but Matthew wouldn't let go.

Â 

Seeing this, Samantha pretended to be generous and said, "Matthew, it's just a cup of milk. Since I don't want it, let Isabella have it."

Â 

Emma also chimed in, "Bella is a guest.Â Let her have it."

Â 

Matthew slowly let go of the cup.

Â 

As Isabella took the cup in her hand, ready to drink, she heard Matthew suddenly say, "Don't drink it."Â He suddenly knocked the cup off.

###chapter 106 Seeking Death

###chapter 106 One Heart Seeking Death

A crisp sound.The cup fell to the ground, spilling milk and shards of glass everywhere.Samantha was startled, "Matthew."Emma breathed a sigh of relief.Isabella frowned, her suspicions confirmed at this moment.She looked up, her eyes filled The crisp sound of a cup that fell to the ground, spilling milk and shards of glass everywhere.

Â 

Samantha was startled, and then she called out to him, "Matthew."

Â 

Emma breathed a sigh of relief.

Â 

Isabella frowned, her suspicions were confirmed at this moment.

Â 

She looked up, her eyes filled with shock and disbelief as she gazed at Matthew.

Â 

He had actually poisoned Samantha.

Â 

Just then, Samantha suddenly clutched her stomach and slowly collapsed to the ground.

Â 

"Samantha, what's wrong?" Emma asked, worriedly.

Â 

Samatha frantically complained, "Mom, my stomach hurts.Â It hurts so much."

Â 

As she spoke, a pool of blood began to flow from where Samantha was crouching.

Â 

Emma exclaimed in shock, "She's bleeding.Â Matthew, quickly drive Samantha to the hospital.Â HurryÂ up!"

Â 

However, Matthew remained unusually calm, glancing at the blood on the floor and at Samantha, saying, "No need to go to the hospital."

Â 

Emma asked, confused, "What nonsense are you talking about? How can we not go to the hospitalÂ at this moment?"

Â 

While Emma was in a panic, Samantha had already passed out.

Â 

Matthew bent down to pick up Samantha from the ground and carried her straight into the house.

Â 

Before long, the family doctor, Paul White, hurried over with a medical kit.

Â 

Isabella and Emma stood at the doorway, able to hear Samantha's heart-wrenching screams coming from inside the room.

Â 

Samantha complained, "It hurts so much!"

Â 

She desperately called out to him, "Matthew, save me!"

Â 

Samantha cried, "My child, my child!"

Â 

IsabellaÂ who wasÂ also pregnant, listened to these cries, subconsciously placing her hand on her abdomen.

Â 

She dared not imagine how desperate and painful Samantha must be feeling at that moment.

Â 

Samantha screamed for over an hour, her voice growing weaker until it finally faded away.

Â 

The door opened, and MatthewÂ who wasÂ covered in blood, walked out.

Â 

"Matthew!" Emma called out to him as she rushed forward, embracing Matthew and weeping uncontrollably.

Â 

With a vacant look in his eyes, Matthew slowly turned to Isabella's face.

Â 

He said, "I'm sorry.Â Bella, I shouldn't be letting you see such a mess."

Â 

Then, with his eyes rolling back, Matthew collapsed on the spot.

Â 

Three days later, when Isabella visited the Landon family again, she discovered that Samantha was no longer there.

Â 

Without Isabella asking, Emma explained to her, "This incident was a significant blow to both Samantha and Matthew. Samantha found out that Matthew had been putting sedatives in her hot milk, so she was almost going crazy."

Â 

Emma sighed deeply, her eyes swollen, indicating the distress she had been through in these few days.

Â 

Isabella asked, "Have they reconciled?"

Â 

Emma shook her head, and regretfully answered, "That day, I had the servants prepare a table full of food and deliberately kept everyone away to give them space. I hoped they could clear up the misunderstanding, but who knew that shortly after we left, Samantha took a fruit knife and cut Matthew's neck.

Â 

"HisÂ wound was deep, and the table was covered in blood. The doctor said that she had narrowly missed the major artery in his neck. If she had not missed, Matthew would have died on the spot."

Â 

At this point, Emma's face lost all color, and her fingers nervously fidgeted.

Â 

Isabella furrowed her brows while listening, trying to imagine how shocking the scene must have been at that moment.

Â 

However, it was still somewhat beyond her imagination.

Â 

She had known Samantha for quite some time andÂ was aware that Samantha could be ruthlessÂ and mean at times.

Â 

But physically harming someone seemed out of character for Samantha,Â let alone cutting Matthew's neck with a knife,

Â 

Isabella couldn't believe that Samantha would do such a thing.

Â 

"Where is Samantha?" Isabella inquired.

Â 

Emma helplessly explained, "I called Samantha's family, and her brother and sister-in-law have taken her back for recuperation. This incident was all because of Matthew. We can't just stand by.

Â 

"I've already arranged matters with her brother and sister-in-law,Â to send twenty thousand dollarsÂ for themÂ every month. Once Samantha and Matthew stabilize emotionally, we'll make further plans."

Â 

As they spoke, a sudden scream from the maid upstairs interrupted them.

Â 

"Matthew!" Emma suddenly exclaimed, almost reflexively stood up, and rushed upstairs.

Â 

Without much thought, Isabella followed her to the second floor.

Â 

Upon reaching Matthew's room, they saw a maid sitting paralyzed on the floor.

Â 

The door was wide open.Â She looked terrified as she gazed into the room.

Â 

Emma approached, and asked, worriedly, "What's going on?"

Â 

The maid seemed to be in shock, maintaining the same posture without any response.

Â 

Â Emma went straight into the room.

Â 

Isabella lagged behind her, and as she reached the door, she heard Emma's piercing cry from inside, "Matthew, my son!"

Â 

Isabella looked up and saw that the bedroom window was open, letting the wind blow in.

Â 

A rope dangled down, and Matthew hung stiffly from it.Â His bodyÂ wasÂ like a thin sheet of paper, his feet dangled in the air and swayed in the wind.

Â 

Soon, the Landon family's servants arrived upon hearing the commotion.

Â 

After much effort, they managed to get Matthew down from the rope.

Â 

With some emergency measures, Matthew was saved from the brink of death.

Â 

Emma knelt on the floor, holding Matthew, in agony as she helplessly wailed, "Matthew, you foolish child, if something happened to you, how can I go on living?"

Â 

Matthew stared blankly with lifeless eyes at the ceiling.

Â 

There was no hint of anger in his eyes, only emptiness.

Â 

Isabella thought that perhaps Matthew's sudden illness was due to the guilt of causing Samantha and their child's death.

Â 

Now, it seemed that Matthew's condition was even more severe than Emma had described.

Â 

Matthew seemed to have lost the will to live. Seeking death with all his heart.

Â 

If they had been a moment later, Matthew might have been nothing but a cold corpse by now.

Â 

Isabella felt no pity for Matthew because in this whole ordeal, he was not a victim but the perpetrator.

Â 

Yet, seeing the once warm and sunny young manÂ becoming like that, Isabella couldn't help but feel a twinge of emotion.

Â 

Emma called out to Matthew many times while holding him, but he remained unresponsive.

Â 

It was as if the Matthew they had saved was nothing more than a walking corpse.

Â 

His soul seemed to have already departed.

Â 

"Matthew, Matthew, look at Mom," Emma pleaded.

Â 

Matthew stared blankly, seemingly deaf to her calls.

Â 

Isabella couldn't bear to watch any longer and spoke up, "Matthew, everything has come to this because of your actions. If you're capable of doing such things, why can't you bear the consequences? And if you can't bear them, why harm others and yourself in such a way?"

Â 

"Bella," Emma said frustratedly as she sobbed.

Â 

She seemed to want to stop Isabella from speaking further but felt powerless to do so.

Â 

It was Emma's single word 'Bella',Â whichÂ seemed to stir something in Matthew's soul.

Â 

Emma felt him move slightly, and when she looked down, she saw a glimmer of life returning to Matthew's eyes.

Â 

His gaze passed over everyone and settled on Isabella standing at the doorway.

Â 

Locking eyes with Isabella, she continued, "Aunt Emma, let him go. If he truly desires death, then let him doÂ it."

Â 

Emma called out to her in a scolding tone, "Bella."

Â 

Isabella sternly remarked, "He's an adult now. After committing such a mistake, he doesn't need others to console him. You can't watch over himÂ all day. If he truly believes death is the release he seeks, then let's grant him that wish."

Â 

With that, Isabella picked up the rope from the floor and walked over to hand it to Matthew.

Emma almost reflexively stood up and rushed upstairs.Without much thought, Isabella followed her to the second floor.Upon reaching Matthew's room, they saw a maid sitting paralyzed on the floor.The door was wide open, and she looked terrified as she gazed into the room.Emma approached, "What's going on?"The maid seemed to be in shock, maintaining the same posture without any response.Ignoring her, Emma went straight into the room.Isabella lagged behind, and as she reached the door, she heard Emma's piercing cry from inside, "Matthew, my son!"Isabella looked up and saw that the bedroom window was open, letting the wind blow in.A rope dangled down, and Matthew hung stiffly from it, his body like a thin sheet of paper, feet dangling in the air, swaying in the wind.Soon, the Landon family's servants arrived upon hearing the commotion.After much effort, they managed to get Matthew down from the rope.With some emergency measures, Matthew was saved from the brink of death.Emma knelt on the floor, holding Matthew, in agony, "Matthew, you foolish child, if something happened to you, how can I go on living?"Matthew stared blankly with lifeless eyes at the ceiling.There was no hint of anger in his eyes, only emptiness.Isabella thought that perhaps Matthew's sudden illness was due to the guilt of causing Samantha and their child's deaths by his own hands.Now, it seemed that Matthew's condition was even more severe than Emma had described.She watched as Matthew seemed to have lost the will to live.Seeking death with all his heart.If they had been a moment later, Matthew might have been nothing but a cold corpse by now.Isabella felt no pity for Matthew because in this whole ordeal, he was not a victim but the perpetrator.Yet, seeing the once warm and sunny young man in his current state, Isabella couldn't help but feel a twinge of emotion.Emma called out to Matthew many times while holding him, but he remained unresponsive.It was as if the Matthew they had saved was nothing more than a walking corpse.His soul seemed to have already departed."Matthew, Matthew, look at Mom," Emma pleaded.Matthew stared blankly, seemingly deaf to her calls.Isabella couldn't bear to watch any longer and spoke up, "Matthew, everything has come to this because of your actions. If you're capable of doing such things, why can't you bear the consequences? And if you can't bear them, why harm others and yourself in such a way?""Bella," Emma sobbed.She seemed to want to stop Isabella from speaking further but felt powerless to do so.It was Emma's single word, "Bella," that seemed to stir something in Matthew's soul.Emma felt him move slightly, and when she looked down, she saw a glimmer of life returning to Matthew's eyes.His gaze passed over everyone and settled on Isabella standing at the doorway.Locking eyes with Isabella, he continued, "Aunt Emma, let him go. If he truly desires death, then let him have it.""Bella.""He's an adult now. After committing such a mistake, he doesn't need others to console him. You can't watch over him twenty-four hours a day. If he truly believes death is the release he seeks, then let's grant him that wish."With that, Isabella picked up the rope from the floor and walked over to hand it to Matthew.

###chapter 107 Falling Disability

Matthew reached out and slowly took the rope.

Â 

Emma nervously reached for his hand immediately, her voice trembling as she called out to him, "Matthew."

Â 

She was truly afraid.

Â 

These days, Matthew's emotions were very unstable.

Â 

Emma dared not let him go out, even having someone watch him at home.

Â 

The doctor visited several times a day.Â Even a wizard was invited to perform rituals at home.

Â 

ButÂ theyÂ still couldn't prevent Matthew's desire for death.

Â 

Matthew stared at the rope for a moment, then slowly raised his head to look at Isabella.

Â 

His face was very haggard.Â In just a few days,Â he looked like a skeleton wrapped in skin.

Â 

At this moment, Matthew's lips were tightly pressed, and the pain in his eyes surged.

Â 

After a while, Matthew unexpectedly coughed up blood.

Â 

Paul arrived quickly, and Charles hurried back from the company upon hearing the news.

Â 

Emma had been wiping away her tears the whole time.

Â 

Charles furrowed his brow, remaining silent.

Â 

In the spacious mansion, there was a suffocating atmosphere.

Â 

Isabella still remembered her first visit to the Landon family, where Charles was kind, Emma was gentle, and Matthew was cheerful and sunny.

Â 

She truly envied such a harmonious and warm family.

Â 

Therefore, she wasÂ used to longing and anticipation for a future she would have with Matthew.

Â 

Looking at the present situation, she just sighed atÂ the impermanence of life.

Â 

Paul came out, Emma and Charles both approached him and asked worriedly, "How is my son?"

Â 

"There is an injury on his neck, andÂ it was strangled too tightly, so his vocal cords are somewhat damaged. Even if he recovers in the future, his voice may be impaired," Paul explained.

Â 

Emma's body swayed, almost unable to stand while she inquired, "Are you saying he will be mute?"

Â 

"If he receivesÂ treatment, he can still speak, but his pronunciation may not be the same as a normal person's anymore," Paul replied.

Â 

A hint of regret flashed in Isabella's eyes. Matthew had chosen to major in broadcasting, saying that he didn't want to join the family company after graduationÂ and that he just wanted to be a broadcaster.

Â 

The current outcome was quite a harsh punishment for Matthew.

Â 

Charles said, "As long as he's alive, we can handle the rest slowly."

Â 

Paul nodded in agreement, and further explained, "Yes. Currently, there is something more serious than being mute. From my observations these days, Mr. Landon's mental illness is the most troubling. If a person suffered fromÂ psychological trauma,Â he would likely be walking on the edge of a cliff.Â One thought can bring life, and another can bring death."

Â 

"We have consulted several psychologists for himÂ andÂ they all say it's a mental block. But as soon as the name Samantha is mentioned, he goes even more insane," Charles said wearily.Â "We don't know what to do."

Â 

Paul suggested, "Are there any good friends he plays with, preferably someone Mr. Landon values and listens to? Find such friends to accompany him more, console him, maybe it will help."

Â 

Charles shook his head in disappointment.

Â 

Matthew seemed very approachable, but his psychological fortitude was actually quite strong.

Â 

He could maintain politeness towards anyone on a regular basis, but the number of people who could truly get close to him was limited. So,Â Samantha was out of the question.

Â 

Emma and Charles both thought of a person at the same time.

Â 

They exchanged glances and then looked at Isabella together.

Â 

Without them saying a word, Isabella understood their intentions.

Â 

Isabella politely declined, "I'm sorry, Aunt Emma, Uncle Landon.Â I'm afraid I can't take on this responsibility."

Â 

Emma approached and knelt directly in front of Isabella, and begged desperately, "Bella, Aunt Emma begs youÂ and pleaseÂ save Matthew. Only you can save his life now.Â Help Auntie bring him back."

Â 

"Aunt Emma," Isabella said as she moved to assist her.

Â 

At that moment, Charles also walked over.

Â 

Although Charles didn't kneel, he too had red eyes, looking earnestly at Isabella, and pleaded, "Isabella, I know Matthew hurt you firstÂ and we shouldn't even be asking this of you."

Â 

He gritted his teeth, and remarked, "But he's our only son, as long as you can help him, we are willing to give you anything."

Â 

Isabella still shook her head, and adamantly refused them, "I'm sorry.Â I really can't help you."

Â 

Isabella was very pure in her emotions and had pure expectations of others.

Â 

The relationship between her and Matthew had always been a high wall.

Â 

Moreover, she didn't think she played such an important role for Matthew.

Â 

After leaving the Landon family, Isabella tried to contact Samantha.

Â 

But Samantha's number was always unreachable.

Â 

After a rainstorm, the weather suddenly turned cold.

Â 

Isabella had been looking for a job for a week, butÂ she never receivedÂ aÂ response fromÂ the resumes she sent out.

Â 

That day, after an interview, she ran into Charles.

Â 

He had the driver stop the car on the side of the road and called out to Isabella through the lowered window, "Isabella, it's really you."

Â 

"Uncle Landon," Isabella stood by the roadside and politely greeted him.

Â 

"Are you here for an interview?" Charles glanced at the resume in her hand and asked casually.

Â 

Isabella honestly replied, "Yes."

Â 

Charles casually inquired, "How did it go?"

Â 

Isabella shook her head.

Â 

Even if she didn't say anything, Charles could tell from her defeated expression.

Â 

"I'll treat you to tea,Â and I have a few things I want to talk to you about in person," Charles said, opening the topic directly.

Â 

As a superior, Charles's invitation was not to be refused.

Â 

The two sat down at a nearby tea restaurant, and Charles handed the menu to Isabella, "The crumpets here are good.Â Have a try."

Â 

Although he said so, Isabella only ordered a cup of tea.

Â 

Isabella thought there would be some small talk, but Charles went straight to the point, "WhatÂ is the relationship betweenÂ you and the sales director of the W.S Group?"

Â 

Isabella was taken aback, a bad feeling rising in her heart, hesitantly asking, "My brother-in-law, did he come to see you?"

Â 

"He came last week to discuss cooperation with us, saying that there was a contract Matthew had promised him before. He seemed quite anxious, so I had someone inquire.Â It seemedÂ he got into some trouble at the company. If it's not rectified in time, he might be dismissed."

Â 

Isabella remained silent.

Â 

She probably knew the purpose of Charles inviting her for tea.

Â 

"Bella, we really need your help. If you think it over, you can give me a call," Charles urged as he pushed his business card over, "Whether it's Charlie's crisis or your job, I canÂ offerÂ help. I have only one condition,Â I need you toÂ help me persuade Matthew."

Â 

After leaving the tea restaurant, Isabella intended to take a taxi to Nina's house.

Â 

But at that moment, Charlie's call came in first.

Â 

Charlie rarely called her, partly because Isabella didn't pay much attention to him, and partly because Charlie didn't show much concern for her.

Â 

Thinking of Charles's words, Isabella answered the call.

Â 

"Hello, Bella," Charlie spoke quickly, "Do you have someone next to you nowÂ andÂ can we talk?"

Â 

Isabella frowned, and impatiently asked, "What's the matter?"

Â 

"I have a bit of trouble here.Â Can you come over?" Charlie asked.

Â 

Isabella had a bad feeling and said, "I'm busy right now."

Â 

Just as she was about to hang up, she heard Charlie say, "Bella, if you won't help me, I'll have to call Nina!"

Â 

###chapter 108 Forty Thousand Dollars

Isabella paused for a moment.

Â 

Charlie continued, "The reason I didn't call her is because she's pregnant now and can't handle any stress. I had no other choice.Â Otherwise, I wouldn't bother you."

Â 

Although Charlie didn't always speakÂ theÂ truth, these words were real.

Â 

Being considerate of Nina, Isabella still asked, "Where are you?"

Â 

"I am at Easthaven train station. RememberÂ toÂ bring me some food." After saying that, he quickly hung up the phone.

Â 

Isabella was full of doubts, but she still went to the nearby bakery, bought a few pieces of bread, and took a taxi to Easthaven train station.

Â 

When she saw Charlie, she was even more shocked.

Â 

Charlie was wearing shabby clothes, and looked disheveled.

Â 

If he hadn't called out to Isabella, she wouldn't have recognized him.

Â 

As soon as he saw her, Charlie asked, "Where's the food?"

Â 

As soon as Isabella took out the bread, he snatched it away. Anxiously tearing open the packaging, he stuffed it into his mouth.

Â 

Isabella frowned and asked, "What are you doing here?"

Â 

While eating bread, Charlie looked around with his eyes and said in a hushed voice, "They're looking for me!"

Â 

Isabella asked, baffled, "Who?"

Â 

Charlie replied anxiously, "The people from the underground casino."

Â 

"The underground casino?" Alarm bells rang in Isabella's mind. She questioned angrily, "Did you go gambling?"

Â 

"Be quiet." Charlie looked panicked, glanced around, then lowered his voice and said, "Bella, do you have any money? Lend me some.Â I need to getÂ out of town, to hide fromÂ them."

Â 

Instead of answering him, Isabella asked, "How much did you lose?"

Â 

He shamelessly replied, "Forty thousand."

Â 

Isabella gasped, "Forty thousand?"

Â 

Charlie, a laborer like him, couldn't earn back that much money in several lifetimes.

Â 

She thought, 'He must be out of his mind.'

Â 

Charlie glanced at Isabella and said calmly, "Do you think I wanted this? With that meager salary, how could I pay the mortgage and support your sister? Initially, I was winning, but then my luck turned.

Â 

"After two rounds of cards, I unknowingly racked up thatÂ much debt. Also, if you had agreed to Matthew's proposal earlier, I would have resolved this crisis long ago. Matthew had promised me a contract of two hundred thousand.

Â 

"After you two got married, he would give me another twenty thousand in cash. So,Â I turned to that,Â it's all because of your incompetence!"

Â 

HeÂ couldn't understand what Isabella was thinking. The Landon familyÂ had offered such good conditions, that marrying MatthewÂ meant a life of luxury.

Â 

Matthew didn't mind Isabella carrying another man's child, yet she insisted on marrying him.

If heÂ were Isabella, he would have marriedÂ Matthew long ago!

Â 

Isabella was always shocked by Charlie's words, coldly saying, "Even if I were to marry in the future, I would only choose an ordinary person. That way, you wouldn't have the chance to blackmail me!"

Â 

A person like Charlie easily lost forty thousand.

Â 

He had no regard for money.

Â 

What kind of family could withstand his trouble?

Â 

Moreover, even before she agreed to Matthew, Charlie was always scheming.

Â 

If she really married into the Landon family, she might never get rid of Charlie forever.

Â 

Charlie touched his nose, then quickly demanded, "Do you have any money? Give me some first."

Â 

"I don't." Isabella said, "You caused this messÂ soÂ you figure it out."

Â 

She didn't linger and turned to leave.

Â 

But at that moment, several men suddenly rushed over from the side.

Â 

They ran past Isabella, creating a gust of wind.

Â 

Someone yelled out, "Charlie, don't run!"

Â 

The station suddenly became lively.

Â 

With many people coming from all directions, Charlie didn't even get to run twenty feet away before a burly man forcefully pinned him to the ground.

Â 

Then, several people carried him out of the station.

Â 

Isabella witnessed the whole thing, her heart pounding.

Â 

But at this moment, she wasn't worried about Charlie, but rather about Nina.

Â 

What would happen to Nina if something happened to Charlie?

Â 

"Whether it's Charlie's crisis or your job, I can help. I have one condition.Â Help me persuade Matthew," Charles' voice echoed in her ears.

Â 

Isabella took out Charles' business card from her pocket, hesitated for a long time, and finally made the call.

Â 

By evening, Charles drove Isabella to the underground casino to bail someone out.

Â 

Exactly forty thousand.

Â 

Isabella watched as Charles wrote down the numbers on the check, feeling a heavy burden in her heart.

Â 

After handing over the check, they waited for over half an hour before the other party brought the person out.

Â 

Charlie was carried out.

Â 

He had been beaten beyond recognition.

Â 

The man who came out with them, Michael, glanced at Charles and Isabella, asking, "Why didn't his wife come?"

Â 

Isabella looked at Michael suspiciously, and questioned, "How do you know his wife didn't come?"

Â 

Michael smiled, and mockingly answered, "There were only two of you who came, and you're the only woman. I know you're not his wife."

Â 

Isabella found it strange, and asked, "Have you met his wife?"

Â 

Michael casually replied, "Of course."

Â 

"Michael!" Richard called out, dressed in a black trench coat, and walked out from inside.

Â 

Isabella met Richard's gaze for a moment and felt a chill run down her spine.

Â 

Richard not only looked fierce, but his eyes also exuded a murderous intent.

Â 

He was clearly not someone to mess with.

Â 

Isabella avoided his gaze, but Richard scrutinized her for a few more moments.

Â 

Charlie knew Isabella was attractive and feared Richard's interest in her, so he slightly moved in front of Isabella, and impatiently asked, "Can we take him away now?"

Â 

Richard finally withdrew his gaze and calmly said, "Yes."

Â 

He then instructed, "Take him and the stretcher to the car."

Â 

Michael replied obediently, "Yes, Brother Richard."

Â 

Charles had the driver pull the car up to the hospital. After the doctor examined Charlie, they arranged for him to be hospitalized.

Â 

With Charlie in his current state, he couldn't go back to see Nina.

Â 

He had to stay in the hospital for a while until he recovered.

Â 

After everything was settled, Isabella escorted Charles out.

Â 

"Thank you for today, Uncle Landon." Isabella took out a prepared promissory note from her pocket,Â and said, "Here, this is for you."

Â 

Charles just glanced at it and didn't take it. "Bella, help between people should be mutual. I helped you because you can help Matthew. So, there's no need for this. I just hope that this forty thousand I spent is worth it."

Â 

Isabella nodded, and humbly replied, "I understand. I'll go see Matthew early tomorrow."

Â 

Charles sighed in relief, and remarked, "In that case, I'll leave it to you. If Aunt Emma finds out, she'll be overjoyed."

Â 

Isabella smiled.

Â 

After watching Charles leave, Isabella also left the hospital.

Â 

As soon as she got on the bus, her phone rang.

Â 

Seeing Jack's name flashing on the screen, Isabella felt a bit dazed.

Â 

It had been half a month since she left the Landon Group, but itÂ felt like yesterday.

Â 

This was the first call Jack made to her since she left.

Â 

Isabella answered the call and put the phone to her ear, then greeted, "Mr. Jack."

Â 

Jack got straight to the point, and immediately asked, "Isabella, where are you now?"

Â 

Isabella glanced at the hospital building and decided not to tell the truth, "I'm on the bus."

Â 

"Did you just go to the Number One Underground Casino?" Jack asked, concerned.

Â 

###chapter 109: For the Sake of the Child?

"How do you know?" Isabella was taken aback. "Were you there too?"

"Yes, I happened to be there. What were you doing at the casino?"

"It's a long story, but I was there to save someone, not to gamble," Isabella quickly explained.

"You didn't run into any trouble, did you? Do you need help?"

"No, it's all sorted out." Isabella reassured him, then asked with concern, "Mr. Jack, you weren't there to gamble, were you?"

Jack was a good man, earning a handsome salary at the Landon Group, a position many envied. He couldn't fall into the trap of gambling like Charlie.Â Because even the best of men could be ruined by it.

"No, I was there for business."

"Oh, that's good," Isabella replied and felt relieved. "Mr. Jack, why did you suddenly call me? Is there something you need?"

"Nothing special, really. I just happened to see you there and wanted to check on you." Jack's voice was somewhat hesitant, unlike his usual fluent manner at the company.

Isabella seemed to hear the faint sound of a pen scratching on paper and asked, "Is Mr. Landon with you?"

As soon as she spoke, the scratching sound abruptly stopped.

Then it resumed for a couple of seconds.

Jack immediately replied, "No."

The scratching sound started again. Jack asked, "Have you found a new job?"

"Yes, I have." Isabella instinctively felt that if Jack knew, then Sebastian would know too. But She didn't want Sebastian to know, so she lied.

The scratching stopped.Â After a short silence, Jack said, "Congratulations. If you run into any trouble you can't solve, feel free to call me. Mr. Landon has instructed me to look out for you."

Sebastian had said the same thing before at the hospital.

"Thank you," Isabella whispered her gratitude.

The scratching sound resumed.

Jack asked, "Is there anything else you want to say ?"

Isabella was silent for a moment.

She actually wanted to ask how Sebastian was doing.

But she felt it wasn't appropriate to ask.

"No, nothing else."

"Shall I hang up then?"

"Yes. Goodbye, Mr. Jack."

After the call ended, Isabella leaned against the car window and watched the street scenes pass by, her eyes filled with confusion.

Meanwhile, Jack looked across the table at Sebastian and said,Â "Mr. Landon, I've found out that Isabella went to Casino No. 1 tonight because her brother-in-law owed four hundred thousand dollars. She went to save him."

"Four hundred thousand?" Sebastian frowned and asked,Â "Where did she get that much money?"

"It was Mr. Landon who went with her, and he paid with a check."

Sebastian pondered for a couple of seconds and said, "Charles Landon wouldn't pay that money for nothing. He must want something from Isabella."

Sebastian thought, 'What could it be? Isabella has almost nothing except herself.'

Jack hesitated and said, "Could it be for the child?"

Sebastian's lips pressed into a thin line.

Though he didn't want to admit it, this seemed the most reasonable explanation.

Jack observed Sebastian's reaction and said, "The Landon family seems to have a lot going on recently, but none of it involves Isabella. Should I look into it?"

Sebastian was silent for a while, then lowered his eyes and said calmly, "No need."

Just then, his phone rang.

After seeing the name ,Vanessa, Sebastian's recently relaxed brow furrowed again.

The next day, Isabella went to the Landon family early.

The servant led her to the door and then left.

Isabella raised her hand and knocked on the door.Â She asked, "May I come in?"

There was no response from inside.

She waited for a moment and raised her voice. "I'm coming in, okay?"

But there was stillÂ no response.

Isabella took a deep breath, reached out, turned the doorknob, and pushed the door open.

The room was dim, with the curtains tightly drawn to keep out any light. Books and various miscellaneous items were scattered on the floor, making the place look chaotic. In the midst of the chaos, Isabella saw Matthew huddled in a corner.

"Matthew Landon?" she called softly.

Matthew slowly regained a bit of lifeÂ upon hearing her voice.

He lifted his head slowly and looked at Isabella. His desolate eyes became brighter.

Matthew opened his mouth but made no sound.

His voice was already ruined.

The dimness of the room made Isabella feel suffocated.

She put down her bag and walked over to pull open the curtains, letting the sunlight pour in.

Matthew did not stop her but shrank further into the dark corner as the light flooded in.

Isabella did not deliberately try to talk to him.Â Instead, she began tidying up the room.

Soon, the room was clean and bright.

She turned around to find that Matthew was still sitting there, staring at her intently.

Isabella bent down to pick up the dirty bed sheets and said,Â "I'm going downstairs to put these in the washing machine. After they're washed, I'll hang them out to dry. Do you want to come?"

Matthew stared at her but did not respond, like a puppet.

"Then I'll go," Isabella said, not coaxing him, and walked away with the sheets.

As she reached downstairs, a few servants gasped at the sight of her.

Isabella noticed they were looking behind her and stopped to turn around.

She saw Matthew had followed her down. When she stopped, he stopped too.

Ignoring him, Isabella asked the servants, "Excuse me, where is the laundry room?"

A servant pointed in a certain direction.

Isabella walked in that direction with the sheets.

As she moved, Matthew followed.

The commotion in the living room attracted Emma and Charles, who came out from the dining room.

Upon seeing this scene, Emma's eyes immediately reddened.

Charles put an arm around her shoulders and comforted her, "With Isabella here, Matthew will get better. Don't worry too much."

In the following days, Isabella made time every day to visit the Landon family and accompany Matthew.

She didn't talk muchÂ and just helped with cleaning and did whatever she could.

After all, it was four hundred thousand dollars. She couldn't feel at ease without doing something in return.

At first, Matthew just followed her around dumbly.

Gradually, as Isabella worked, he began to help a little.

But Matthew's eyes always had a shadow over them, as if he could never return to his former image.

One day, after hanging out the bedding to dry, Isabella sat on the grass to read a book.

The sunlight was warm on her.

Before long, she felt drowsy and fell asleep.

When Isabella woke up, she found her head resting on Matthew's leg.

Matthew raised his hand, shading her face from the glaring sun.

Isabella was stunned for a second, then quickly sat up.Â "Did I sleep for long?"

She hadn't even woken up when he moved her head onto his leg.

Matthew took out his phone and typed a few words: [Not long.]

Isabella glanced at the time and stood up.Â "I should go."

But Matthew grabbed her hand and handed her the phone. [I had the servant make some nutritious soup for your pregnancy. Drink it before you go.]"

Isabella shook her head and said,Â "No, thank you. I'm not used to it."

[It's for the baby. You're too thin and need the nutrition.]

At that moment, a servant brought over the soup.

Matthew picked it up and scooped some with a spoon, gently bringing it to Isabella's lips.

Isabella stepped back a few paces. For some reason, it reminded her of the day he fed milk to Samantha, whichÂ made her feel scared.

"I really don't like it. I'll go now."

As soon as Isabella turned around, she heard the sound of something breaking behind her, followed by the servant's scream.

###chapter 110: Getting Back Together?

Isabella turned around and saw the bowl of tonic smashed against the wall.

Matthew was grabbing the maid by her hair, pressing her onto the ground, and slamming her head repeatedly.

Matthew's face was filled with rageÂ with fierce eyes, as if he was holding a ball instead of a human head.

Isabella was stunned by the scene, standing there for several minutes, unable to react.

It wasn't until Emma rushed out with a few servants that they managed to restrain the crazed Matthew.

The maid's head was already bleeding profusely.

Isabella even saw a handful of hair in Matthew's hand.

The doctor came and gave Matthew a sedative injection, which finally calmed him down.

Emma closed the door and walked up to the pale-faced Isabella, saying,Â "Bella, what on earth happened? Why did Matthew suddenly go mad?"

Clearly, Matthew's condition had been improving these past few days, and his emotions had stabilized a lot.

Isabella bit her lip.Â "I don't know either. I just said I didn't want to drink the tonic, and then this happened."

Thinking about what had just happened, Isabella still felt a bit scared.

Afterwards, Emma suggested arranging a driver to take her back.

Isabella refused.

She walked along the roadside, thinking about what had just happened, and couldn't help but squat downÂ toÂ vomit.

Behind her came the sound of a car.

A black car pulled up behind her, the door opened, and someone got out, footsteps stopping behind her.

Isabella thought it was the security from the villa area coming to chase her away, so she said without turning her head, "Sorry, I'll leave right away."

But the next second, her arm was grabbedÂ by someone, and she was pulled up.

Isabella stumbled and barely managed to stand, only to see that it was Sebastian.

"What are you doing here?" Sebastian's gaze swept over her pale face as he asked.

Isabella didn't expect to run into him here. After a moment of surprise, she replied, "I just left the Landon family."

Sebastian's face stiffened, his hand gripping her arm stiffened, and then he let go, saying ambiguously, "Have you reconciled with Matthew?"

"No," Isabella instinctively replied.

She looked up and met Sebastian's deep and unreadable eyes.

Isabella's heart skipped a beat.Â She pursed her lips, saying no more.

As they stood there in a stalemate, Sebastian's phone rang.

He answered it.Â Vanessa's voice came through the receiver.Â "Sebastian, have you arrived?"

Sebastian frowned and said,Â "Something came up. I'll have Jack pick you up."

"Alright then."

After hanging up, Sebastian said to Isabella, "You don't look well. Do you need to go to the hospital?"

"No, I'm fine. Thank you for your concern, Mr. Landon."

Isabella turned to leave, but Sebastian grabbed her arm once more.

"Get in the car," he said in a tone that brooked no argument, opening the car door.

Isabella didn't want to get in. She had finally drawn a clear line between them, soÂ getting into his car now didn't seem right.

But just then, another car approached from behind.

Sebastian's car was parked by the roadside.Â There wasÂ clearlyÂ plenty of room to pass, but the other car stopped right behind Sebastian's.

It even honked its horn.

Afraid of being scolded, Isabella had no choice but to get in the car.

Strangely, as soon as she got in, the car behind them stopped honking.

Sebastian glanced at her and said,Â "Buckle up."

Isabella silently fastened her seatbelt.

The car started. Suddenly, a call from Zaire appeared on Sebastian's car display screen.

He casually pressed the answer button, and the call was on speaker. Thus, Zaire's voice echoed throughout the car.Â "So, how do you plan to thank me?"

Sebastian focused on driving, saying, "I don't plan to."

Zaire chuckled, and two honks could be heard from his side.

Almost simultaneously, two honks came from behind them.

Isabella turned around in surprise and saw that the car was still following closely behind Sebastian's.

She slowly realized that the person in the car behind them was Zaire.

Sebastian abruptly hung up the phone.

Then, as they were about to exit the villa area, he signaled a right turn but suddenly swerved left.

By the time Zaire realized it, he had already been left behind. Holding the steering wheel, heÂ laughed and called out, "Well, Sebastian, you really are something!" With that, he drove away leisurely.

Just after their two cars left, another car slowly drove out of the villa area.

Inside the car, Laura was driving, and Vanessa was in the passenger seat.

"What's going on?" Laura asked, full of curiosity.Â "Isabella has already resigned. Why is she here?"

Vanessa frowned, her face still calm, saying,Â "Maybe it was a coincidence."

"Coincidence?" Laura found it hard to believe. "It seemed likeÂ they planned to meet here. Vanessa, didn't you say Mr. Landon was coming to pick you up? Why did he suddenly have something come up, and Isabella just happened to be on his way? Even if it was a coincidence, why would Mr. Landon hold Isabella's hand and pull her into the car? Vanessa, are you sure you've dealt with Isabella?"

Vanessa's face turned uglyÂ upon hearing theseÂ words.

She bit her lip hard and finally said, "I trust Sebastian."

Laura shrugged. "Alright, so where are we going now? Do you want to go home or come to the bar with me?"

Vanessa didn't feel like going home.

Going back would mean facing Zoe.

She was already tired of trying to please Zoe every day.

"Let's go to the bar."

Laura drove to the bar, but after a few drinks, she received a call and left in a hurry.

Vanessa was left alone, drinking at the bar. On her way to the restroom, she stumbled and bumped into Charlie. Charlie immediately started cursing, "Can't you see where you're going?"

Before he could finish, they recognized each other.

"Ms. Field?"Charlie said.

Charlie quickly changed to a fawning expression.Â "What a coincidence, Ms. Field, are you here to have fun too?"

Vanessa frowned, finding Charlie somewhat familiar but couldn't recall where she had seen him before.

She asked, "Who are you?"

"Me? I'm Charlie," he introduced himself.

Vanessa shook her head.Â "You must be mistaken. I don't know you."

Upon sayingÂ that, she tried to leave.

Charlie stepped forward and grabbed her wrist.

Although Vanessa wasn't particularly beautiful, her skin was cool and well-maintained, making it feel quite pleasant.

Charlie felt a surge of excitement as he touched her.

Vanessa, however, found it disgusting and pulled her hand back, saying coldly, "If you touch me again, I'll call for help!"

"No! " Charlie quickly put on a smile. "You don't remember me? It's like family not recognizing family."

"Psycho!" Vanessa didn't want to deal with him.

Seeing her about to leave, Charlie hurriedly said, "I'm Isabella's brother-in-law!"

Vanessa paused, squinting at Charlie, and a smile appeared on her faceÂ slowly.Â "So it's you!"

###chapter 111 Accompanying Her for a Prenatal Checkup

Sebastian drove the car to the hospital. Â Isabella had no choice but to grit her teeth,Â get out of the car and followed him into the hospital.

Â At the registration machine,Â Sebastian extended his hand towards her and said, "Card."

Â Isabella rummaged through her bag for a moment and handed over the medical cardÂ to him.

Â Â Sebastian operated on the screen for a while, then turned to ask her, "Which doctor do you usually see?"

Â There were many people in line behind them, and Isabella didn't want to delay others, so she reached out and tapped a few times on the screen, finding Dr. Johnson.

Â Â After registering, the two of them took the escalator upstairs.

Â Â Seeing that Sebastian didn't seem to have any intention of leaving, Isabella spoke up, "Mr. Landon, thank you for bringing me to the hospital. You can leave me hereÂ andÂ I can go in by myself."

Â Sebastian stopped in his tracks and questioned, "Are you embarrassed to have me accompany you?" Â 

"That's not what I meant."

Â Â Sebastian continued, "Which way?"

Â Isabella had no choice but to lead him to the obstetrics and gynecology department.

Â A sign sayingÂ "No Men Beyond This Point"Â stood at the entrance to the consultation room. Sebastian handed her the card and said, "I'll wait for you outside."

Â "Okay." Isabella took the card and entered the consultation room. Â Because Sebastian was waiting outside, Isabella seemed a bit distracted.

Â Jessica routinely asked, "No unusual symptoms recently, right?"

Â Isabella thought for a moment and said, "Does a small amount of bleeding count?"

Â Jessica paused and looked up at her. "Have you had any intense sexual activity?"

Â Â Isabella's face flushed as she thought of that night. Â She hadn't expected that even when Sebastian was feeling unwell, he could still be so vigorous.

Â The intensity was comparable to their first time in the tentÂ and it was evenÂ more vigorous.Â It was as if Sebastian had been holding back for too long and was finally released.

Â Jessica could tell the answer from her expression and frowned. "Your boyfriend accompany you here earlier?"

Â Â Isabella was taken aback, realizing the doctor had misunderstood. Â Just as she was about to explain, Jessica said, "Call him inÂ andÂ I have a few things to tell him."

Â Isabella looked troubled. "Doctor, he's not my boyfriend."

Â "Not your boyfriend, but he came with you for a prenatal checkup?" Jessica shook her head, looking helpless.Â "You look about the same age as my daughter, so I'm telling you this. You should call him inÂ and I need to ask him."

Â Isabella still refused. "Whatever you need to tell me, just say it to meÂ directly. I'll keep in mind."

Â "No intense sexual activity.Â I've told you this before. You're too soft-hearted. Your boyfriend looks like a successful man,Â so are you unable to make decisions at home? Even if you can't, you both need to take the child's matters seriously," Jessica said, reaching out to press the intercom button in front of her.

Â The other end was connected to the nurse's guidance desk outside. After it was connected, Jessica said, "Mary, please call in Isabella's family member."

Â "Okay, Director."

Â It happened too quickly for Isabella to stop it. Â Soon, there was a knock on the door. Â "Come in." Â The door to the consultation room was pushed open, and SebÂ strode in with a straight and imposing presence. Â 

"Are you Isabella's boyfriend?" Jessica asked directly.

Â Sebastian closed the door, walked over, and stood slightly behind Isabella.

Â Hearing this, he looked down at Isabella. Â Isabella waved her hands repeatedly, eager to clarify her relationship with Sebastian. "No, doctor, he's just my former boss."

Â Â Jessica didn't respond to her, her gaze fixed on Sebastian, waiting for his answer. Â Sebastian didn't answer directly but asked, "Is there something wrong with her?"

Â Jessica didn't waste any more words and got straight to the point. "During the first three months of pregnancy, there should be no intense sexual activity. I remind herÂ of this every time she comes for a checkup."

"Young people are full of vigor, and I understand you desire . But for the sake of the child, it's best not to be too intense during the first and last three months," Jessica said, her words precise and to the point. Â 

"This is no joking matter.Â If not careful, it could lead to a miscarriage. She's already shown signs of bleeding, so you need to be extra cautious."

Upon Jessica's saying,Â Isabella's face turned bright red.Â Sebastian listened with a frown on his face and replied, "Alright, we'll be careful."

Â Jessica then wrote an order for an ultrasound and handed it to them.

Â Â Sebastian took long strides, quickly leaving Isabella far behind.

Â Â Isabella watched his back, sensing a change in his attitude from before.

Â Â Suddenly, Sebastian stopped and turned to look at her. Â When he stopped, Isabella instinctively halted as well.Â Thus, there remained a distance between them, neither too close nor too far. It seemed close enough that if he waited a bit and she hurried a bit, they could walk side by side. But Isabella knew that the distance between her and Sebastian wasÂ somethingÂ that could never be bridged in a lifetime.

In the silent exchange of their gazes, ten seconds passed unnoticed.

Â Â Sebastian suddenly lifted his foot and walked towards her. Â As he got closer, Isabella's heart pounded. Â "Why did you stop?" Sebastian asked, standing in front of her, looking down.

Â His deep, dark eyes fell on Isabella's small face. He couldn't understand why heÂ kept him thinking about her. Â When he couldn't see her, he could manage to endure it, but once they met, Sebastian felt uncontrollable to be near her. Â If it weren't for the fact that Isabella was carrying Matthew's child and had reconciled with Matthew, Sebastian would have suspected that Isabella had cast some spell on him. Â And that was the only explanation for his loss of control.

Â Isabella lowered her head, unable to meet Sebastian's gaze. "I can go for the ultrasound by myself.Â Mr. Landon. You should go back to your work."

Â He asked, "Do you really want to get rid of me that badly?" Â Isabella felt a pang in her heart.Â Â 

She clutched the ultrasound request form tightly, her voice still soft but with a sharp edge. "Men and women should keep their distance, especially since I'm pregnant. Mr. Landon, you should avoid suspicion."

Â Â Sebastian's brows furrowed slightly as he stared at her. "Yes, I should avoid suspicion." Â In name, he was the child's uncle. Â But in reality, Sebastian wanted nothing to do with anyone connected to the Landon family.

Â Hearing Sebastian's words, Isabella thought he was going to leave. Â But after waiting a moment, he was still standing in front of her.

Â Isabella couldn't help but look up at Sebastian. Â As soon as their eyes met, Sebastian suddenly pulled her close. Â Isabella was almost pressed against Sebastian. Â His fingers were so strong, gripping her wrist like steel, that she had no chance to pull away. Â His dark eyes locked onto hers. He asked, "Have you really decided to reconcile with Matthew?"

Â Isabella knew Sebastian had misunderstood. Â She usually disliked being misunderstood, especially about her relationship with Matthew. If it were anyone else, she would have explained. Â But Sebastian was someone she needed to push away, so she pressed her lips together and didn't plan to explain.

Â Sebastian let go of her hand. Â Isabella quickly stepped back, keeping her distance from him.

Â Â Sebastian's face grew darker. "Go for the ultrasound. I'll wait for you in the car."Â He still intended to take her back.

Â Isabella looked up, but before she could say a word, he interrupted her coldly, "I brought you here, so naturally, I should ensure you get back safely!"Â Sebastian's tone left no room for refusal, devoid of the earlier ambiguity.

Â 

###chapter 112 You Don't Want Me

Isabella finished her check-up and came out to find Sebastian's car waiting for her, just as she had expected.

She walked over. As she opened the car door, she caught a faint whiff of smoke inside.

"Have you been smoking?" Isabella asked in surprise.

She had been with the Landon Group for over six months and had never seen Sebastian smoke. He always appeared clean and fresh, never carrying such a strong smell of smoke.

Sebastian paused for a moment. "Yes."

He rolled down the window and turned on the car's air purifier.

In a moment, the faint smell of smoke disappeared.

The car started slowly. After leaving the hospital, he headed straight for Harvard University.

The two of them remained silent throughout the drive.

Sebastian parked the car in front of the girls' dormitory. As Isabella got out, she ran into Patricia Brown, who was taking out the trash.

"Bella's back." Through the car window, Patricia saw Sebastian sitting inside and walked over enthusiastically to greet him, "Mr. Landon, long time no see."

Out of courtesy, Sebastian got out of the car and nodded slightly. "Hello."

Patricia peered into the car, saying, "Your assistant didn't come with you? I asked my niece last time, and she's willing to give it a try. If it's convenient, could you leave me your assistant's contact information?"

A look of helplessness appeared on Sebastian's face and he said, "I'm afraid I can't."

"Why not?"

"He is in a relationship now."

Patricia looked disappointed. "So soon?"

Sebastian glanced at Isabella. "Outstanding people are always sought after. If you hesitate, someone else will snatch them away. It's understandable."

Isabella was speechless.

She felt that Sebastian was implying something.

Isabella went upstairs and ran to the balcony.

Downstairs, Sebastian was still standing by the car, and Patricia was tirelessly discussing her niece's marriage arrangements with him.

Suddenly, Sebastian seemed to sense something and looked up in her direction. Isabella was so startled that she quickly pulled back.

Not sure if he had seen her, Isabella clutched her chest, feeling guilty and breaking out in a cold sweat.

The urgent ringing of her phone interrupted her thoughts. Isabella looked at the screen and saw it was Kelsey calling.

As soon as she answered, she heard Kelsey's sobbing.

"Isabella, I feel so awful right now. My heart is breaking. It really hurts."

Kelsey's words were incoherent, mixed with sobs and occasional swallowing sounds.

Isabella asked, "Have you been drinking again?"

Kelsey seemed unable to hear her, continuing to babble and cry.

"Where are you? I'll come find you right away."

This time, Kelsey heard her.

"Rose Clubhouse." Kelsey stopped crying and earnestly pleaded, "Isabella, can you bring him with you?"

"Jack?"

"Yes. I want to see him, but he keeps avoiding me."

Isabella hesitated for only a second and said, "Alright."

Isabella hurried downstairs just as Sebastian was about to leave.

Seeing her run over, he stepped on the brake.

"Mr. Landon, Ms. Jose is in trouble!" Isabella said almost out of breath.

Sebastian didn't ask for details. "Get in."

"Alright." This time, Isabella didn't show him any courtesy, opening the car door and getting in. She then gave the address, saying, "Rose Clubhouse."

She took out her phone and called Jack.

Jack answered quickly. "Isabella?"

"Jack, are you free right now?"

"What's up?"

"Ms. Jose wants to see you. Can you..."

Before she could finish, Jack interrupted her, "Sorry, I can't."

"But Ms. Jose..."

"There is nothing between Ms. Jose and me. I already apologized to her for what happened last time." Jack's voice was cold.

Isabella found herself at a loss for words.

"Sorry, I can't help you," Jack said before hanging up.

Isabella held her phone, feeling quite bewildered.

She could tell that Jack wasn't usually cold and heartless towards Kelsey.

"Do you need my help?" Sebastian's voice came from the front seat.

Isabella looked up at him, the light slowly returning to her confused eyes. She quickly handed over her phone,saying, "Yes!"

Sebastian glanced at it and said unhurriedly, "Answer one question for me first."

Isabella was speechless.

There were conditions after all.

Sebastian didn't wait for her agreement and asked, "Why did you suddenly resign?"

He had asked this question last time at the hospital.

Isabella felt that Sebastian seemed somewhat fixated on this.

After thinking for a moment, she said, "I felt the Landon Group wasn't suitable for me."

"And have you found a suitable job now?"

"Yes," Isabella replied, nodding lightly.

"But the dormitory supervisor said you've been unemployed for a long time." Sebastian calmly exposed her lie.

Isabella was speechless.

Patricia had only met Sebastian twice, yet she told him everything.

Sebastian glanced at her through the rearview mirror and continued, "She also asked me if you had made some mistakes so that I dismiss you. ."

"Mr. Landon."

"I told her it wasn't that I didn't want you, but that you didn't want me."

Isabella flushed, and she bit her lip. "Mr. Landon, I've answered your question. Can you call Jack now?"

Sebastian casually dialed Jack's number.

Once connected, without any small talk, he said directly, "Go to Rose Clubhouse."

Sebastian was the boss.

Whatever he asked, Jack wouldn't question or refuse.

Jack simply agreed and hung up.

At Rose Clubhouse, when Isabella and Sebastian arrived, they saw Zaire standing at the door of a private room, knocking and saying, "Kelsey, open the door and let me in to talk to you. Be good."

"Mr. Jose, Ms. Miller and Mr. Landon are here," the club manager said, walking over.

Zaire turned around and pulled Isabella over. "You're just in time. Help me persuade her. Kelsey has locked herself inside, and I'm worried she'll do something foolish."

Isabella nodded and stepped forward to knock on the door. " Kelsey, it's Isabella. Can you open the door and let me in?"

There was no response from inside, but a few seconds later, the door clicked open from the inside.

Kelsey stood in the doorway, her long hair disheveled and her makeup smeared from crying, looking quite a mess.

"Finally, you opened the door." Zaire's tense expression relaxed upon seeing she was unharmed.

Kelsey only opened the door a crack, scanning the outside before asking Isabella, "Where is he?"

"Jack is on his way."

As soon as Isabella finished speaking, the elevator dinged.

Everyone turned to see Jack stepping out of the elevator.

And following closely behind him was a woman, Nancy Shaw.

Isabella suddenly recalled Sebastian's earlier refusal to Patricia.

It turned out that when he said Jack had been in a relationship, it wasn't just an excuse.

Jack really was dating with someone.

Isabella looked at Kelsey with concern, fearing she wouldn't be able to accept it..

But Kelsey remained relatively calm, her gaze fixed on Jack and Nancy's clasped hands for a few seconds.

Jack walked over, holding Nancy's hand. "Let me introduce you to my fiancÃ©e, Nancy Shaw."

###chapter 113: Am I a Burden?

Isabella was stunned by the word "fiancÃ©e".

Her gaze once again fell upon the girl named Nancy. She looked much younger than Jack, wearing a brand-new dress, but her hair was styled in two braids. Her face was bare of makeup, and when she smiled, two shallow dimples appeared.

Unlike Kelsey's confidence, Nancy seemed really constrained, her eyes barely daring to meet anyone's gaze.

She stood by Jack, looking very much in need of protection.

"So, this is what you like?" Kelsey's smile was bitter.

Perhaps Kelsey couldn't understand why she had lost to a plain-looking Nancy.

Jack looked at her, his gaze calm. "Ms. Jose, I don't know if I've done something to make you misunderstand. If it's about what happened last time at Mr. Landon's house, I've already apologized to you. I do have a fiancÃ©e, and I hope you won't trouble me anymore."

Kelsey bit her lip lightly. "Am I a burden to you?"

"Causing trouble in someone else's life isn't a burden but harassment," Jack corrected her sternly.

Kelsey was stunned.

Zaire couldn't stand it anymore and pushed Jack. "Jack, can you think before you speak? How is my sister harassing you?"

"Sorry, Mr. Jose." Jack lowered his eyes, but his back remained straight. "Though my words are harsh, they are the truth."

"You!" Zaire was at a loss.

After all, Jack was Sebastian's man, and over the years, Jack had quite a few dealings with Zaire.

If it were anyone else, Zaire would have tied him up and brought him to Kelsey.

But Jack was different.

If Jack didn't want to do something, even if Zaire tied him up, it would be useless.

Moreover, now that Jack had a fiancÃ©e, they couldn't do anything to ruin his relationship.

Feeling sorry for Kelsey, Zaire could only comfort her, "Kelsey, don't be angry. If you like this type, I'll find you one tomorrow, and I'll make sure you're satisfied!"

Kelsey said nothing, just looked at Jack and his fiancÃ©e, her eyes brimming with tears.

"Mr. Jose, if there's nothing else, we'll be leaving now." Jack took Nancy's hand and turned to leave.

Kelsey sniffled, looking at Jack's back, and shouted loudly, "Fine, then my brother will find me someone better!"

"That's my sister!"

These words clearly reached Jack's ears, and he frowned.

Nancy whispered, "Jack, you're hurting me."

Jack lowered his eyes and said softly, "Sorry."

The elevator arrived, and Jack led Nancy inside, disappearing from their sight.

After that day, Kelsey really moved on.

The next day, she started dating.

But she was quite picky, meeting many men but never finding one she liked.

The only one she dated was someone Isabella accompanied her to meet.

That guy had eyebrows and eyes that resembled Jack's. As soon as Isabella saw him, she thought something would happen.

Expectedly, Kelsey took an interest in him. After dinner, they exchanged phone numbers and talked about another date.

For the next week or so, Kelsey shared Isabella daily dates with the guy who looked like Jack .

They either held hands while shopping, fed each other, or watched the sunrise and sunset together.

In short, every photo was filled with three words: happiness and love. Kelsey would post statuses every day, sometimes dozens in a single day. Each caption was sweet.

It seemed lively on the surface, but Isabella felt that Kelsey was going to the other extreme.

Sure enough, after a few days, Kelsey came to find Isabella.

"You don't have a date today?" Isabella asked as she got into the car.

In just a few days, Kelsey's entire style had changed.

Kelsey used to have the elegant style of a young lady, but now, Isabella looked at Kelsey's punk outfit, her short hair, and the colorful hairbands braided into her hair. She found it hard to adapt to her transformation.

"Are you talking about the new date? My brother is still looking for one, so I'm free for now."

Isabella had a certain suspicion in her heart, saying, "What about the guy who looked like Jack?"

"We broke up," Kelsey said nonchalantly.

"Broke up?"

This result didn't really surprise Isabella, as she had seen from the beginning that Kelsey wasn't serious.

What she found unbelievable was another matter. "I remember you posted a status this morning, showing off your love?"

It had only been a little over two hours since Kelsey posted that status.

That wasÂ too fast.

Kelsey smiled and asked, "Bella, you must think I'm awful now?"

Isabella was silent for a moment, then said, "I just thought you two seemed to be getting along well. How did you break up so quickly?"

"Actually, at first, it was going well, but as time went on, it just became very boring."

Isabella blinked and said, "But you guys have only been dating for two weeks, right?"

Kelsey changed the subject. "Let's not talk about these depressing things. I know a new restaurant that just opened. I'll take you there to try it."

Kelsey said she would take Isabella to eat, but instead, she first took Isabella around the mall, buying a lot of things.

When they passed a baby store, Kelsey even said she wanted to buy Isabella a big cradle.

Isabella had to drag her away.

"Didn't you say you were taking me to eat? I'm hungry. Let's go eat." Isabella was really afraid that if Kelsey kept shopping, she would max out several credit cards.

So, the two of them went to the restaurant.

As soon as they sat down, they heard a voice from the next table. "Jack, thank you for bringing me here to eat. This place must be expensive, right?"

Then Jack's voice followed. "Not at all. This is your birthday gift."

Hearing this, Isabella paused.

Kelsey's expression also stiffened, but she continued to look at the menu, not turning a page for a long time.

The voices from the next table continued.

"Wow, what a beautiful necklace. Is this really for me?"

"Yes."

"Thank you, Jack. I love it. Jack, can you help me put it on?"

"Sure."

Jack stood up, and his gaze inadvertently glanced over to their table.

Thus, his eyes met Isabella's.

Isabella hadn't expected to run into Jack and Nancy while having a meal, andÂ they were at the next table.

If it weren't for the high booth between the tables, this awkward situation wouldn't have happened.

Jack was also taken aback for a moment, then his gaze fell on the person opposite Isabella.

"Jack?" Nancy's voice sounded again.

Jack withdrew his gaze and walked over to her, lowering his head to put the necklace on her.

After putting on the necklace, Jack seemed to be planning to return to his seat. But at that moment, Nancy suddenly pulled him, quickly turned to the side, and kissed him on the cheek.

###chapter 114: You Believe Everything She Says

Jack probably didn't expect her to do that and froze for a moment.

Nancy was extremely shy and said, "Jack, thank you for the gift. This is the best birthday I've ever had."

As she spoke, Nancy took out her phone, saying, "I want to take some pictures to show my parents. They will be very happy to see them."

Something flickered in Jack's eyes and he responded, "Ok."

Isabella noticed that Kelsey was almost turning into a fossil and whispered, "Why don't we go somewhere else to eat?"

Kelsey looked up. "Why?"

After a two-second pause, she changed her question. "Why should we?"

Isabella wanted to say thatshe was afraid Kelsey wouldn't be able to eat here comfortably.

Kelsey seemed to read her mind, smiled slightly, and continued to flip through the menu. "We're paying to eat here. I want to eat here. Why should we let them have their way?"

With that, Kelsey waved to order a few dishes.

Perhaps the conversation between Kelsey and Isabella caught Nancy's attention.

Â Nancy first looked back and then stood up.

When she saw Kelsey, her expression turned panicked, as if facing a formidable enemy. "Ms. Jose?"

Kelsey didn't put on airs but smiled at her. "Hi, what a small world."

Nancy's face stiffened.

Facing Kelsey, Nancy was clearly nervous and somewhat dreadful.

Jack said, "Nancy, sit down and eat."

He meant that she didn't need to pay attention to Kelsey.

Nancy glanced at Kelsey again before sitting back down.

Kelsey also turned her head, looking relatively calm.

After a moment of silence, the sound of a video call came from the next table.

Nancy said, "It's my parents calling. Jack, can I sit with you? They haven't seen you in a long time and probably miss you."

"Sure," Jack agreed readily.

Nancy moved over, holding up her phone to greet her family on the other end. "Mom, Dad."

"Nancy, Jack is there too. Today is your birthday. Did you have noodles?"

"Yes, I did. Jack also took me out for dinner and gave me a birthday gift." Nancy lifted the necklace around her neck, saying, "Look, isn't this necklace beautiful?"

"Very beautiful. Jack, with you taking care of Nancy, we are relieved."

Jack said, "Don't worry. I will take good care of Nancy."

"Nancy told us that you're doing well in Lakina, with a house and a car. Jack, you're not young anymore. When will you and Nancy have the wedding? Once you're married, living together will be more proper, and we'll be even more at ease."

At the mention of the wedding, Isabella saw Kelsey's face turn pale.

Kelsey put down her utensils and stood up, saying, "I'm going to the restroom."

After she left, Jack said, "Nancy is still young. We're not in a hurry."

Nancy's parents didn't push for the wedding and started talking about other things.

About a minute or two later, they ended the call.

Nancy put her phone on the table and stood up, saying, "Jack, I'm going to the restroom."

"Okay, go ahead."

Isabella watched Nancy leave. Suddenly a figure appeared in front of her.

It was Jack.

"Isabella, did Kelsey follow us here on purpose?" he asked directly.

Isabella shook her head, saying, "Of course not. We just happened to come here to eat and didn't expect to see you."

Although it did look deliberate, it really wasn't Kelsey's fault this time.

Jack frowned slightly, then called the waiter, paid the bill, and picked up his coat and Nancy's bag.

It seemed that Jack planned to leave immediately once Nancy came out of the restroom.

Seeing this, Isabella couldn't help but speak up, "Jack, you don't have to avoid Kelsey like this. If you're not hiding something, you don't need to avoid her; the more you avoid her, the more it looks like there's a problem."

Jack frowned but said nothing.

At that moment, a sudden scream erupted from the direction of the restroom.

Isabella and Jack looked over simultaneously and saw a female guest running out in a panic.

Jack approached her and asked, "What happened?"

The female guest pointed towards the restroom and said, "There's a fight. Two girls are fighting there."

Before she could finish her sentence, Jack had already rushed towards the restroom.

Isabella hesitated for a few seconds and then quickly followed.

By the time Isabella reached the restroom door, Jack had already kicked it open, and the fight inside had stopped.

Jack shielded Nancy behind him, his gaze coldly fixed on Kelsey, who was leaning against the sink. He demanded icily, "What did you do to Nancy?"

Kelsey's dress was soaked in a large area, but the rest of her was intact.

Nancy, on the other hand, was a mess. Isabella cast a look and was shocked.

Nancy was drenched from head to toe, her hair disheveled, her collar buttons torn off, and there was a noticeable scratch on her neck.

The situation seemed to be clear. Anyone would think Kelsey had bullied Nancy after watching the scene.

But Isabella felt that Kelsey wouldn't go that far.

Hearing Jack's question, Kelsey sneered, "What did I do to her? Why don't you ask her what she did to me?"

Jack was taken aback and turned to look at Nancy.

Nancy looked at Jack with grievance, biting her lip, tears welling up in her eyes. "Jack, I just told Ms. Jose that we are about to get engaged. She suddenly went crazy."

"You're lying!" Kelsey glared, ready to hit her again.

Jack stopped her and said, "What are you doing?"

Kelsey was stunned and pointed at Nancy, saying, "She's lying. I want to tear her mouth apart so she won't dare to slander me again."

"Slander you?" Jack stared at her, his eyes cold. "You're clean and dry, but Nancy is soaked. How dare you say she's slandering you?"

Kelsey gritted her teeth. "Jack, are your eyes just for show? Can't you see I got dirty too?"

"But not as dirty as Nancy!" Jack shook off her hand and issued a stern warning, "Ms. Jose, this is the last time. If it happens again, even if Mr. Jose wants to protect you, I will stand up for Nancy!"

As Kelsey heard this, her body trembled slightly.

Jack, however, ignored her and turned to support Nancy, his voice instantly gentle. "Can you walk?"

Nancy nodded, looking very pitiful.

Jack was about to help Nancy out, but she stopped him, her voice carrying a sob. "Jack, my necklace."

Jack looked at Nancy's neck and saw that the necklace was missing.

Nancy's gaze was fixed on Kelsey.

Jack assumed that Kelsey had taken the necklace. After reassuring Nancy, he walked over to Kelsey.

He extended his hand, expressionless. " Give the necklace back to Nancy."

Kelsey laughed in anger. "You believe everything she says. Jack, are you an idiot?"

Jack ignored her words, still frowned, and repeated coldly, "The necklace!"

###chapter 115 Big Slap
"I didn't take it. That worthless necklace, even my dog wouldn't want it!" Kelsey averted her gaze, as if looking at Jack for another second would hurt her eyes.

Isabella walked over and said, "Jack, considering Ms. Jose's family background, I don't think she would need to steal someone else's necklace."

Jack fell silent.

Indeed, that necklace was very precious to Nancy.

But to Kelsey, it meant nothing at all.

At that moment, Nancy suddenly pointed at Kelsey's pocket and said, "Jack, the necklace is in her pocket."

Everyone was stunned, including Kelsey.

Kelsey seemed to have realized something, and her gaze seemed to kill Nancy.

Jack held Nancy's hand and comforted, "Forget it, if it's lost, I'll buy you a new one."

"But..." Nancy wanted to say something, but Jack's look stopped her.

Isabella understood that Jack didn't want to pursue the matter any further. Whether the necklace was really in Kelsey's pocket or not, he wanted to let it go..

Just as Jack was leading Nancy out of the restroom, two police officers suddenly walked in.

"Who called the police?"

No one spoke.

Isabella's gaze lingered on Kelsey's face for a moment. After seeing her bewildered expression, it was clear she hadn't called the police.

"It was me," Nancy said timidly.

She still clung to Jack's side, looking frail and delicate.

Jack turned to her abruptly, his eyes filled with question and confusion.

Nancy shrank back a little and said, "I just want to get my necklace back."

One of the officers stepped forward and asked, "What's going on?"

Ignoring Jack's intense gaze, Nancy turned to Kelsey and said in a timid voice, "Ms. Jose, I know you don't care about that necklace. You're just jealous of me and Jack. No matter what, please return the necklace to me. It's very important to me!"

"Jealous of you?" Kelsey laughed disdainfully.

But Nancy persisted, "Anyway, please return the necklace to me."

Kelsey had a fiery temper. She was provoked by Nancy and was now fuming with rage. She immediately reached into her pocket.

With just one touch, her expression froze.

Without any hesitation, she glared fiercely at Nancy and pulled her hand out of her pocket.

Kelsey spread out her palm, revealing a broken necklace.

"That's it!" Nancy exclaimed, stepping forward to take it.

Before Nancy's fingers could touch the necklace, Kelsey slapped her across the face.

The crisp sound echoed. Nancy screamed, stumbling and falling to the ground in a disheveled state from Kelsey's slap.

Kelsey threw the necklace at Nancy. "You wretch, how dare you set me up!"

As she spoke, she raised her hand to strike again.

But this time, her slap never landed.

Kelsey turned around to find Jack standing beside her, gripping her wrist with such force that it was almost crushed.

Kelsey's face turned pale, but she still glared at Jack, gritting her teeth. "She framed me. I didn't steal her stuff!"

"That doesn't matter," Jack coldly replied.

"Jack, " Nancy cried out from the ground.

Jack's expression softened slightly as he forcefully released Kelsey and bent down to help Nancy.

As soon as he crouched down, Nancy threw herself into his arms, sobbing uncontrollably.

Kelsey was thrown by Jack's force, her lower back hitting the edge of the sink, making her face even paler.

Isabella supported her. "Are you okay?"

Kelsey didn't answer her. She just stared at the scene where Nancy and Jack huddled together, as if she had lost her soul.

Half an hour later, it was at the police station.

After finishing her statement, Kelsey came out.

Coincidentally, the door next to her also opened, and Jack and Nancy walked out.

Inevitably, they ran into each other again.

Kelsey smirked and walked towards them.

Nancy was so frightened that she kept edging further behind Jack.

Jack shielded her behind him, facing Kelsey coldly. "Ms. Jose, that's enough!"

It seemed that Kelsey's eyes were practically shooting sparks. "I've never been falsely accused in my life. Jack, I'm not done with you!"

"What do you want?" Jack looked at her, his eyes not just cold but also filled with disgust.

Kelsey felt a sharp pain, her heart aching even more, and her words became even harsher. "I'll give you three days to get out of Lakina. As long as you and Nancy are in Lakina, I swear that I won't let you live in peace!"

Jack furrowed his brows tightly, saying nothing.

The sound of hurried footsteps approached.

"Kelsey!" Zaire rushed over, pushing Jack aside and protecting Kelsey.

Seeing that Kelsey was okay, Zaire turned to Jack and questioned, "What's your problem?"

Jack lowered his head and said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Jose."

This apology was an attempt to make amends and to hope thatÂ Zaire wouldn't pursue the matter further.

After all, Jack was Sebastian's subordinate, and Zaire wasn't one to be ruthless.

In fact, Jack's appropriate concession was an attempt to de-escalate the situation.

But Nancy behind him didn't understand his intention. She immediately stepped forward and said, "Jack, this isn't our fault. Why should we apologize?"

As soon as she finished speaking, Nancy felt a gaze fall upon her face.

She turned and met Zaire's eyes.

Nancy's expression changed slightly. She bit her lip and boldly stepped out from behind Jack. "Mr. Jose, just because your family is wealthy doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. This is a society governed by law. Clearly, Ms. Jose is in the wrong. Shouldn't you distinguish right from wrong and make your sister apologize?"

The Nancy who appeared weak in front of Kelsey was now assertive in front of Zaire. As she spoke, she looked Zaire straight, as if she suddenly wasn't afraid of him.

Isabella noticed something was off.

Logically, Zaire was more intimidating than Kelsey. Why wasn't Nancy afraid of Zaire but was afraid of Kelsey?

Zaire let out a mocking laugh. He suddenly took two steps forward, standing in front of Nancy, bending slightly to get close to her face. "It seems Ms. Shaw is used to being poor. Yes, having money does allow one to do whatever he want."

Nancy blinked, a subtle change in her emotions. "I only know that the law treats everyone equally."

Zaire chuckled.

Nancy wanted to say more, but Jack pulled her back, distancing her from Zaire.

"Mr. Jose, this is my fault. No matter how you wantÂ to punish me, I'll accept it." Jack paused, then added, "Ms. Jose just said we have three days to leave Lakina. If you say the same, we'll go back and pack our things immediately."

Zaire glanced at him, his tone somewhat helpless. "Jack, have you lost your senses?"

Then he turned to Kelsey and asked, "Kelsey, have you thought it through? Do you really want them to leave Lakina?"

###chapter 116: Kneel Down

As he posed the question, all eyes turned to Kelsey.

Just now, Kelsey had been sitting on the side, watching the drama unfold.

She saw it clearly that Nancy was nothing but a scheming woman.

And Jack? He was simply a scoundrel.

If they were allowed to leave just like that, it would be too easy on them.

Kelsey couldn't stomach this insult. She looked at Jack and said, "This whole matter started because of you. If you kneel down and apologize to me, considering Sebastian and Isabella, I'll let it go."

Jack hadn't spoken yet when Nancy grabbed his sleeve. "Jack, don't kneel!"

Jack glanced at her, then said to Kelsey, " It's a deal. I hope Ms. Jose will keep your word."

"Of course."

Without hesitation, Jack dropped to one knee first with a thud.

"Jack!" Nancy tugged at him. "You can't kneel!"

"It's okay." Jack turned back, his hand gently caressing her face in a comforting manner.

Nancy shot Kelsey a furious look, then her gaze fell on Zaire's face, lingering for a few seconds before she also knelt down beside Jack with a thud.

"Nancy."

"It's okay, Jack. I'm with you!"

Seeing Jack and Nancy kneeling together on the ground, Kelsey withdrew her gaze, feeling utterly exhausted.

She leaned on Zaire's shoulder, closed her eyes, and said, "Zaire, I'm tired. I want to go home and sleep."

"Alright." Without another word, Zaire scooped Kelsey up and walked out.

As Isabella turned back, she saw Nancy staring at Zaire's retreating figure, curling her lips.

Zaire's car was parked outside, and the man standing beside it, tall and straight as a pine tree, was Sebastian.

Isabella paused for a moment but still walked over.

Kelsey had already been placed in the back seat. Zaire covered her with a blanket, closed the car door, and turned to Isabella, saying, "Isabella, thank you for calling me tonight."

"You're welcome. It was the right thing to do."

"I have another favor to ask."

"Go ahead."

Zaire glanced at Sebastian and said, "I know my sister's character well. She's very stubborn. Tonight's event was a blow to her, and I'm afraid she won't recover easily. She has a bad temper and doesn't have many friends in our circle, but she values you. Could you stay at our house tonight and help console her? Once she's stable tomorrow, I'll have someone take you home."

This wasn't an unreasonable request .

Isabella hesitated for a moment and then agreed.

Seeing her agreement, Zaire patted Sebastian's shoulder and said, "Mr. Landon, I'll need you to drive us back."

Isabella paused as she reached for the car door. Zaire looked over and explained, "I had some drinks. Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked him to drive me here."

Zaire's explanation made Sebastian look over at her as well.

Isabella avoided Sebastian's gaze and quickly got into the back seat.

Kelsey had taken a nap in the car and woke up before they reached home.

Knowing Isabella would spendthe night, she was very happy.

As soon as the car stopped, Kelsey pulled Isabella and rushed into the house.

They almost bumped into someone.

"What are you rushing for?" A gentle middle-aged woman's voice came.

Isabella looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a lake-blue dress standing before her. She had a well-proportioned figure, gentle features, and a kind smile, making her look very approachable.

Kelsey pulled Isabella forward and said, "Mom, let me introduce you. This is Isabella, my good friend."

'So she is Kelsey's mother, Margaret Moore,' Isabella thought.

"So, you're Isabella?" Margaret smiled at Isabella and said, "Kelsey has mentioned you countless times. It's nice to meet you."

Isabella quickly shook hands with Margaret and greeted, "Hello, Mrs. Jose. Sorry for the intrusion."

Kelsey said, "Isabella is staying with me tonight. Come on, Isabella, I'll show you my room."

With that, she hurriedly pulled Isabella upstairs.

Margaret watched them from below, smiling. "Take it easy, you two."

Hearing this, Isabella turned her head. Her gaze met Margaret's for a moment before Kelsey pulled her away.

"Mom." Zaire and Sebastian walked in side by side.

Sebastian greeted politely, "Mrs. Jose."

"Long time no see, Sebastian." Margaret was quite fond of Sebastian and had always hoped he would become her son-in-law. So when Kelsey pursued him fervently, the elder members of the Jose family had tacitly approved.

Unfortunately, Kelsey wasn't that lucky. Despite her long pursuit, she never won Sebastian's heart.

Thinking of this, Margaret couldn't help but feel a bit regretful.

Zaire, sensing something was off, took her hand and asked, "What's wrong, Mom?"

"Nothing," Margaret replied, shaking her head. It wouldn't be appropriate to say anything in front of Sebastian, so she changed the subject. "I've met Isabella. She's such a pretty and polite girl. No wonder Kelsey likes her so much."

"Isn't she? Isabella is quite charming. Not only does Kelsey like her, but others have their eyes on her too."

"Others? Who?"

Zaire smiled mysteriously and glanced at Sebastian.

Margaret sighed and said, "Isabella reminds me of Lisa."

Zaire held Margaret's shoulder, comforting her, "Mom, don't blame yourself for the past. Rest assured, as long as Lisa is alive, we'll find her one day."

"Yes," Margaret nodded and said.

Perhaps she had heard such comfort many times. Or maybe, over the years, she had learned to accept it.

She didn't dwell on her sadness, instead forcing a smile and patting Zaire's shoulder. "It's getting late. You should get some rest too."

"Alright."

As Margaret walked away, the smile on Zaire's face gradually faded. "After all these years, my mom is still the same. "

Sebastian asked, "Still no news?"

Zaire shook his head and said, "Not a single clue."

Isabella was pulled into the room by Kelsey, who showed her all her beautiful clothes and jewelry.

Kelsey asked, "Aren't they pretty?"

Isabella nodded. "Yes, very pretty."

"Pick a few. I'll give them to you."

Isabella was taken aback and shook her head. "No, thank you."

She stared at a set of blue jewelry in front of her, clearly lost in thought.

Kelsey patted her shoulder and asked, "What's wrong? You've been distracted since we came upstairs."

Isabella bit her lip, hesitating. "I don't know why, but when seeing your mom, I felt a sense of familiarity, like I've seen her somewhere before."

"Really?" Kelsey didn't think much of it. "Maybe you really have seen her somewhere."

###chapter 117: Mr. Landon Sleepwalks

Upon Kelsey's saying, Isabella didn't pay much attention to it.

Next, Isabella carefully examined Kelsey's beautiful clothes and jewelry.

After a while, a servant knocked on the door outside the dressing room and said, "Miss, the water in the bathroom is ready for you. Would you like to take a bath now?"

"Of course." Kelsey threw down what she was holding and pulled Isabella into the bathroom.

Her bathroom was very large, and the bathtub was spacious enough for both of them to soak in comfortably.

Moreover, the bathtub had various massage functions, making Isabella feel very relaxed.

After the bath, Kelsey dried Isabella's hair and picked out a silk nightgown for her.

Kelsey also sprayed some expensive perfume on Isabella.

Then the two of them stood in front of the mirror.

"Isabella, you are so beautiful," Kelsey said without hesitation, her eyes almost glued to Isabella.

Isabella, being reserved, felt embarrassed by Kelsey's praise and her direct gaze.Â 

Isabella said,"You are even more beautiful."

"Honestly, with your demeanor, you don't seem like you grew up in a small town. If you dressed up, I would believe you were a princess."

"Stop teasing me."

The two of them held hands and went into the bedroom, lying on Kelsey's big princess bed.

Facing each other, Kelsey giggled, saying, "Oh, I've finally fulfilled my dream."

"What dream?"

Kelsey's hand reached out from under the blanket and pinched Isabella's soft hand. "Actually, I have an older sister named Lisa Jose. But she got lost when she was little. My dad, mom, and brother have been looking for her all these years but haven't found her. Ever since I knew I had a sister, I fantasized every day that she would come back and we would sleep in the same bed, just like you and me now, lying peacefully and talking."

Isabella was surprised and touched. "You will definitely find her!"

"Yes."

Kelsey yawned and closed her eyes. "I'm so sleepy."

Within seconds, Kelsey fell asleep.

Isabella marveled at her ability to sleep, tucked her in, and closed her eyes as well.

The villa area was very quiet, and the sound of the breeze brushing the treetops outside could be heard clearly.

After a while, Isabella opened her eyes again.

She had trouble sleeping in a new bed.

So she couldn't fall asleep.

Isabella lifted the blanket and put on a coat, intending to find a glass of water.

Kelsey's room was very large, but Isabella searched for a long time and couldn't find any drinking water.

So she opened the door and walked out.

The wall lights in the villa were on. When Isabella walked downstairs, she saw a room with its light on and faint sounds coming from inside.

She thought it was a servant of the Jose family who was still busy, and she felt a bit relieved, so she walked quickly over.

"Excuse me..."

Her words got stuck in her throat as the person turned around.

Sebastian was wearing a dark blue pajamas, long pants and long sleeves, with a tangle of black hair over his forehead. He was holding a cup, seemingly drinking water.

"Mr. Landon?" Isabella didn't expect him to be awake so late.

Nor did she expect the coincidence that Sebastian was also downstairs looking for water.

She greeted Sebastian and walked into the kitchen.

But Sebastian didn't respond, as if he didn't see her, continuing to drink water without changing his actions.

Isabella walked in, looked around, and couldn't find a cup.

As a guest in the Jose family, it wouldn't be polite to open their cabinets without permission.

So she had to ask Sebastian, "Mr. Landon, where did you get your cup?"

Sebastian didn't respond.

"Mr. Landon?" Isabella called out, but Sebastian still didn't react. At this moment, Isabella realized something was wrong.

From the moment she entered, Sebastian had maintained the same posture, staring blankly at the wall, his movements appearing very mechanical.

While Isabella was in a daze, Sebastian had already finished drinking.

He walked to the sink, rinsed the cup, and placed it on the counter.

Turning around, he walked out mechanically.

It was only after Sebastian's footsteps had completely faded that Isabella came to her senses. She thought, 'Could he be sleepwalking?'

She turned back, staring at the cup Sebastian had used, swallowing hard.

She had only felt a bit thirsty earlier, but now Isabella felt parched.

'Using Sebastian's cup and then washing it clean and putting it back should be fine, right?' she thought.

As Isabella thought this, she found herself inching closer.

By the time she realized it, she had already picked up the cup and filled it with water.

Looking at the clear water in the cup, Isabella couldn't resist and took several big gulps.

Suddenly, Isabella felt a gaze fall upon her.

She caught a glimpse of a figure standing at the kitchen door, startling her so much that she shivered, and the cup slipped from her hand.

The cup fell to the ground, shattering into pieces.

Panicking, Isabella squatted down to pick up the pieces, but the next second, a hand pulled her up.

Sebastian grabbed her wrist, forcing Isabella to stand on tiptoe, her whole body pressed against his.

They were both only wearing thin silk pajamas.

Even with just a few seconds of contact, Isabella could feel the heat of his skin.

Sebastian seemed to sense something too, lowering his head to look at her.

Meeting his deep gaze, Isabella panicked even more, trying to pull her wrist away and step back.

Upon seeing this, Sebastian's eyes narrowed sharply, and he reached out again.

This time, Sebastian didn't grab Isabella's wrist but instead wrapped one arm around her waist and lifted her legs with the other.

Isabella felt her body lighten as she was lifted into his arms.

Stunned, Isabella clutched the collar of his pajamas, feeling uncertain. "Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian didn't respond.

He carried Isabella, walked through the living room, and went straight upstairs.

"Mr. Landon, where are you taking me?" Isabella tried to jump out of his arms.

But Sebastian's grip on her waist was forceful, and she couldn't muster any strength.

Isabella didn't dare to make too much noise, fearing she would wake the rest of the Jose family. If they saw this scene, she wouldn't be able to explain herself.

Thus, Isabella was carried by Sebastian into a guest room.

After entering, Sebastian placed her on the bed.

Before Isabella could get up, he pressed down on her from behind, his arm like a steel band around her waist, his palm firmly against her lower abdomen.

"Mr. Landon!" Isabella was both embarrassed and scared.

She tried to pry Sebastian's fingers away, but he pulled her back, pressing her tightly against his chest.

Now, she was truly trapped, unable to escape.

After a while, Isabella heard Sebastian's steady and calm breathing behind her.

He had fallen asleep.

Biting her lip, Isabella tried again to pry Sebastian's hand away.

She struggled for a long time, but it was all in vain.

Even in his sleep, Sebastian's arm held her tightly and she couldn't budge an inch.

Isabella's hands grew sore. As she managed to loosen his grip a bit, Sebastian pulled her back into his arms, holding her even tighter.

In the end, her eyelids grew heavy.

Unable to resist the sleepiness, she drifted into a dream.

In the morning, when Sebastian opened his eyes, he felt a dull ache in his arm.

A faint, familiar yet unfamiliar scent filled his nostrils, causing a tightness in his lower body.

Looking down, Sebastian was incredulous to see Isabella curled up in his arms, sleeping soundly. He said, "Isabella?"

###chapter 118: A Familiar Sight

Isabella slept soundly, her breath soft, and her long, thick lashes resting on her eyelids.

Under the covers, Isabella's legs were pressed closely against Sebastian's, and one of her hands lay on Sebastian's neck, as if in an intimate embrace between lovers.

She had her head slightly tilted back, her nostrils flaring, and her rosy lips slightly parted, as if silently inviting Sebastian.

Sebastian had no idea how she had ended up in his bed.

Men are naturally more excitable in the morning, and now, with Isabella so close, Sebastian felt his desire growing uncontrollably.

But he didn't want to wake Isabella.

Because he knew that once she opened her eyes, Isabella would immediately panic and run away.

Sebastian stared at Isabella's lips, his Adam's apple moving with difficulty.

Then he lowered his head and gently brushed her lips.

He pulled away after just a touch.

Seeing that Isabella showed no signs of waking, he leaned in again. This time he lingered longer.

Sebastian thought this might ease his longing, but it only made him hungrier.

Feeling the soft silk fabric under his palm, he hesitated for a moment before boldly slipping his hand under Isabella's nightgown.

Isabella, in her drowsy state, felt someone pecking at her lips.

At first, she thought she was dreaming, but the sensation grew clearer, so she suddenly opened her eyes.

In front of her, it was Sebastian's magnified handsome face.

Isabella's mind went blank for two seconds before she remembered what had happened last night.

She had failed to escape and had fallen asleep in the end.

And she had slept so soundly.

When she woke up, it was almost dawn.

But fortunately, Sebastian was still asleep.

Isabella felt the weight on her chest, and when she looked down, her cheeks burned.

Carefully, Isabella moved Sebastian's hand away, slipped out of his embrace, put on her slippers, and fled.

As soon as the door closed, Sebastian opened his eyes.

He sat up in bed, looked at the tightly closed door, and then raised his left hand.

Recalling the sensation, Sebastian narrowed his eyes.

Isabella had just stepped out of the guest room when she bumped into Zaire, who had messy hair.

"Isabella?" Zaire still in his pajamas, holding a glass of milk, had clearly just woken up.

He looked at Isabella, then at the door behind her, a knowing and gossipy smile spreading across his face. "Wow."

"It's not what you think!" Isabella quickly explained, "I came downstairs for water last night and happened to find Mr. Landon sleepwalking."

Zaire said nothing, just sipping his milk with a mischievous smile, listening to her explanation.

His expression seemed to say, "Go on, I'm listening."

Isabella was speechless.

She felt that no matter what she said now, Zaire wouldn't believe her and she would only dig herself deeper.

"Mr. Jose, it's really not what you think. Could you please not tell Mr. Landon that I came out of his room this morning?"

Zaire raised an eyebrow and said,"Isabella, do you know how many women would love to be associated with Seb? Why are you so eager to distance yourself from him?"

"Others are others, and I am me. Mr. Jose, I'm begging you." Isabella looked at him pitifully.

"Alright." Zaire agreed readily, "Since you helped take care of Kelsey, I promise I won't tell him."

"Thank you so much, Mr. Jose. You're a good man."

Zaire chuckled, saying "If you don't leave now, I won't know how to explain it to him when he wakes up."

Zaire kindly pointed her in the right direction. "Kelsey's room is straight ahead, turn right at the end and then left."

"Thank you, Mr. Jose." Isabella bowed to him and quickly ran off.

Almost as soon as Isabella's figure disappeared around the corner, Sebastian's door opened from the inside.

Zaire looked at Sebastian standing in the doorway and raised an eyebrow, saying "Sleepwalking?"

Sebastian gave him a faint glance, saying "I've been emotionally unstable lately, maybe because of work stress."

Zaire burst out laughing. "That excuse might fool Isabella, but not me. Come on, what happened between you two last night?"

Sebastian was a bit speechless. "Didn't you promise her not to tell me?"

Zaire shrugged. "I only promised not to say that she came out of your room this morning. I'm asking what happened between you two. That's different."

"I don't remember," Sebastian replied.

Zaire squinted and asked, " You slept with Isabella, shouldn't you take responsibility?"

Sebastian was silent for a moment. "You're right."

Zaire felt confused and said,"I've never understood what you see in Vanessa. If it were Isabella, I could get it. Vanessa has been at your company for over a year; if you had feelings for her, you would've made a move long ago. Why wait until now?"

Sebastian suddenly looked up and asked, "What did you just say?"

Zaire was taken aback. "I said if you had feelings for Vanessa, you would've made a move long ago."

"The sentence before that!"

"I've never understood what you see in Vanessa?"

"Not that one!" Sebastian's eyes were almost menacing.

Zaire felt a bit scared standing in front of Sebastian.Â 

"If it were Isabella, I could get it."

"You're right!" Sebastian's eyes lit up, and he gave Zaire a heavy pat on his shoulder. "That's the problem! Why didn't I think of that?"

"What?" Zaire was completely confused, scratching his head. "Have you lost your mind from holding back too much?"

Sebastian smiled at him. "You're right. Maybe I have lost my mind!"

Otherwise, he, Sebastian, wouldn't have missed something so obvious.

Zaire was speechless.

The Jose family's breakfast was sumptuous.

At the dining table, Isabella met Kelsey's father, Steven Jose.

Steven was a businessman, shrewd and authoritative in the outside world, but within the Jose family, he was just a loving father.

He would peel eggs for Kelsey and listen attentively to them, responding to everything they said.

Isabella envied this family atmosphere, her eyes growing warm.

When she turned her head, she found Sebastian also looking at her.

His gaze was equally intense.

Isabella couldn't help but wonder, 'Did Zaire say something to him?'

But when she turned to look at Zaire, he just smiled at her warmly and even winked at her.

Zaire indicated that he had kept his promise and hadn't said anything he shouldn't have.

Suddenly, an extra egg appeared in Isabella's bowl.

Isabella looked up as she saw Margaret withdraw her spoon.

Margaret smiled at Isabella. "You're our guest, so I peeled one for you too."

Isabella was overwhelmed. "Thank you, Mrs. Jose."

An egg brought tears to her eyes .

Zaire laughed. "Isabella, you really are something special. You know, I've never had an egg peeled by my mom."

Margaret looked at Isabella with a very gentle expression. "I don't know why, whenI look at Isabella, I feel a sense of familiarity. It's like I've known her for a long time."

Before she could finish, Kelsey said, "Mom, you and Isabella both said the same thing. Isabella also said that she might see you somewhere before."

As soon as these words were spoken, the entire dining room fell silent.

###chapter 119: The Paternity Test

All eyes were fixed on Isabella's face.

Isabella remained silent.

Margaret and Steven exchanged glances and said, "But the age doesn't seem to match, does it?"

Zaire asked, "Isabella, where are you from?"

"Palovia."

"The location doesn't match either." Zaire looked at his parents, thought for a moment, and asked Isabella, "Did you ever visit Alvia when you were a child?"

Isabella shook her head.

Isabella also realized that the Jose family might think she was Lisa.

She explained, "I have been dependent on my sister since childhood. So Mrs. Jose and I probably just have a natural affinity."

Margaret asked, "Do you have only one sister? No parents?"

Isabella shook her head. "My sister said my father died and my mother left. When she abandoned us, my sister was only seven, and I was still an infant."

"Such a poor child!" Margaret sighed, feeling deeply sorry for Isabella's story. "You must have suffered a lot, haven't you?"

"It's all in the past. Everything is fine now."

Margaret nodded.

Kelsey, who had been listening all along, finally reacted. "Mom, Dad, Zaire, are you suspecting that Isabella is my long-lost sister?"

Zaire rubbed his forehead and said, "Kelsey, you really have a slow reflex."

The topic was almost over, and Kelsey just realized it.

Kelsey looked at Isabella, then at the others, and said, "It's strange, though. When I first saw Isabella, I felt she was special. When I saw her being bullied, I couldn't help but step in to help. Now Mom also says she feels a connection with Isabella, and Isabella says the same. What if she is really my sister.?"

"But the age and the place where your sister went missing don't match," Margaret said, looking at Isabella with regret.

She really liked Isabella.

After all these years, she wondered what would Lisa become...

"My sister was very young when she went missing. Age can be fabricated. Maybe she was taken to a different city after being found." Kelsey said excitedly, abandoning her breakfast and pulling Isabella up to her feet, "I think we should try. What if Isabella really is my sister? We can't miss this chance."

Margaret's eyes sparkled. "You mean?"

"Do a paternity test!" Kelsey said, then directly asked Isabella, "Isabella, would you be willing to do it?"

Isabella found it hard to believe. "I don't think it's possible."

After all, she had her sister Nina. If she had been adopted, Nina would have told her.

She had never heard Nina mention it.

"Whether it's true or not, a blood test will make it clear. The report won't lie, and it will put everyone's mind at ease."

Seeing the eager eyes of the Jose family, Isabella thought that a blood test wasn't a big deal and finally nodded.

After breakfast, a doctor came to draw blood.

But the test would take at least three days.

Isabella bid farewell to the Jose family, and Margaret and Kelsey saw her to the door.

Kelsey's eyes were bright. "Isabella, you should be prepared. If you really are my sister, I'll be bothering you a lot in the future."

Isabella smiled and said, "I don't think it's possible."

Margaret held her hand and said, "Whether you are or not, you're always welcome to visit."

"Thank you, Mrs. Jose."

The sound of a car engine came from behind.

Sebastian drove up behind Isabella. "I'm heading back to the company. Where are you going? I'll give you a ride."

Isabella wanted to say that they were not on the same path, but Kelsey gave her a push on the waist. "Then we'll leave her to you."

With that, Kelsey pulled Margaret back into the house.

Sebastian got out of the car, walked around the front, and came to Isabella, personally opening the car door for her. "It's hard to get a cab here. If you don't want trouble others, you'd better get in."

Isabella thought for a moment and agreed, "Then I'll trouble you, Mr. Landon."

Once in the car, as soon as the engine started, Sebastian asked her, "To Harvar University?"

Isabella hesitated and said, "To the Landon family."

Sebastian's face darkened instantly, and Isabella felt the air in the car grow thin.

Though Sebastian looked displeased, he still drove her to the Landon family.

The car didn't enter the Landon family estate. Isabella got out outside, politely thanked Sebastian, and then walked into the estate.

Sebastian sat in the car, watching her back for a long time. He then took out his phone and called Jack.

"How's the investigation going?"

Jack was silent for a moment and then said, "Sorry, Mr. Landon, give me a bit more time."

"What's wrong with you?" Sebastian frowned and said, "This isn't like you."

The reason Jack had become his special assistant was his efficiency. Tasks Sebastian assigned were usually quickly handled by Jack, which could be concluded those words: high efficiency, high speed.

A female voice came from the other end of the line. "Jack!"

Jack hurriedly said, "Mr. Landon, I'll handle it soon."

Sebastian said calmly, "No need, take care of your matters first. I'll have someone else investigate."

"Yes, Mr. Landon."

After hanging up the phone, Jack quickly walked into the kitchen. "What's wrong?"

Nancy, holding a spatula, looked at the broken bowl on the floor with a face full of fear. "I'm sorry, Jack. I wanted to make you a bowl of macaroni and cheese."

"It's okay." Jack took the spatula from her and comforted, "You go out first and I'll handle this."

Nancy nodded and walked out.

When Jack finished cleaning up and came out, she was already sitting on the sofa watching TV.

Jack took the trash bag to the door, and Nancy followed, hugging him from behind. "Jack, where are we going to play today?"

Jack was taken aback and said, "I have to go to work today."

Nancy hugged him tightly. "But you promised to take me to the amusement park. I've never been there before."

"I'm usually busy with work." Jack comforted, "How about I take you there on the weekend when I'm free?"

"No!" Nancy was upset, her eyes filled with tears. "You promised me!"

"But I really have to work."

Nancy bit her lip. "So you're just going to leave me here alone? Can I go to the office with you? I promise I won't disturb you. I'll just watch from afar."

"That's not possible."

"Why not!" Nancy's eyes were teary. "Are you embarrassed to have me there?"

"That's not what I mean."

"Then I'll go change!" Nancy didn't give Jack a chance to refuse and went to change her clothes.

Jack had no choice but to take Nancy along.

At the Landon Group, Jack left Nancy in the lobby's resting area, found some magazines for her, and gave her a tablet. "Nancy, you can read or play on the tablet here. I'll take you to eat something nice when I get off at noon."

Nancy blinked and looked around the lobby, saying, "It's so beautiful here. Jack, Is this where you work? It's so big and luxurious."

###chapter 120: Radiating Light

"My work area is in the upstairs executive office."

"Executive office?" Nancy, like a child who had stumbled into a new world, was filled with curiosity about everything here. "Executive? I've only seen that term in novels. Jack, are you the executive of this company?"

"No. Mr. Landon is."

"Oh. Then what do you do, Jack? Are you the general manager?" Nancy's questions flowed endlessly.

Jack felt a slight headache but still patiently explained to Nancy, "I am Mr. Landon's assistant."

Nancy's face showed disappointment. "Assistant means doing odd jobs, right? In the novels I've read that the executive assistant is always running around wherever needed. Jack, I didn't expect you to work so hard."

Saying this, Nancy stood on tiptoe and kissed Jack on the cheek.

Jack quickly took two steps back and said sternly, "Nancy, this is at the company. Don't do that!"

Jack wasn't very harsh, but Nancy's eyes reddened. "I'm sorry, Jack. I'm from the countryside and don't know the rules. If you think I'm embarrassing you here, I'll just leave."

She made a move to leave, but Jack pulled her back.

Jack had just coaxed her a few words when Nancy saw Kelsey entering through the main door.

No longer in the disheveled state of last night, Kelsey was now full of vigor.

As she walked through the door, several colleagues greeted her.

"Hi, Kelsey. You look so beautiful today."

"Yes, you're radiating light and full of joy. Is there something good happening?"

Kelsey smiled. "There is something good, but it's not certain yet."

"A few days ago, I saw your status update with a photo of your boyfriend. You two looked so in love. Are you getting married soon?"

"Ah, so happy!"

"Your boyfriend must be very handsome, right?"

"Kelsey's family background is good, and she has high standards. Her partner must be exceptional."

Kelsey also saw Jack and Nancy but only glanced at them before turning her attention back to her colleagues. She clocked in and entered the elevator.

Nancy watched, feeling very jealous. "Jack, Kelsey's dress is so pretty. I want one too."

Jack frowned slightly. "Wait here for me and don't wander around. Once I finish my work, I'll take you to the mall to buy one."

"Really?" Nancy was delighted. "Jack, you're so good to me."

After comforting Nancy, Jack gave a few instructions to the receptionist and then went upstairs.

But what Jack didn't know was that as soon as he left, Nancy stood up and began to wander around the lobby.

The assistants were all busy with their tasks.

Jack, holding a file, asked, "Where is Laura?"

"Jack, Laura had an emergency and took the day off."

"Andy Williams will be coming over soon. Who will receive him?"

After Jack said this, the assistant department fell into a dead silence.

The girls who met Jack's gaze quickly lowered their heads, afraid of being named.

"Amber?"

"Jack, I have documents to work on. So I don't have time."

"Little Amber?"

"I also have a client meeting soon."

The other girls quickly found excuses to avoid the task.

"No one has time, right?" Jack closed the file. "Fine, I'll receive him myself."

Just as he was about to leave, someone stood up from the corner, and a clear voice followed. "I'll go."

Everyone looked over. Jack frowned and said, "Not you."

"Why not me? I'm also a member of the assistant department. Jack, do you have a bias against me, so you ignore me when assigning tasks?" Kelsey said with a mocking smile on her face.

Jack looked at her for a few seconds. "Fine, you do it."

With that, he left.

Kelsey sat down and touched up her makeup.

Several girls immediately gathered around.

"Kelsey, Andy Williams is not a good person. You should be careful."

Kelsey closed her compact. "I'm not afraid."

In the VIP Lounge, Kelsey greeted, "Mr. Williams." She placed a cup of hot tea in front of Andy. "Please have some tea."

From the moment Andy entered, his eyes were constantly on Kelsey. As Kelsey approached, the faint scent of her perfume wafted to his nose. Andy took a deep breath, sniffed, and said, "Ms. Jose, what brand of perfume are you wearing? It smells wonderful."

His lecherous expression was blatantly obvious.

"This one?" Kelsey replied, "It's the latest from v.a, Gardenia in the Rain."

Andy's gaze lingered on Kelsey, tracing her from head to toe. "Hmm, Ms. Jose, what about your dress?"

"This is the new collection from V.L."

"Ms. Jose, you have excellent taste. The perfume you wear and the dress you choose are all high-end brands. It seems Mr. Landon is quite generous with your salary."

Before Kelsey could respond, Jack interjected, "Andy, you might not know, but Ms. Jose is the daughter of the Jose family and Mr. Jose's sister. She's here at the Landon Group not to work but to experience life."

"Oh?" Andy was slightly surprised.

Kelsey disliked Jack's introduction and smiled at Andy, saying, "Jack is mistaken. I am here to work, not to experience life. Andy, please don't treat me as an exception. At the Landon Group, I am just an ordinary employee."

Hearing this, Jack looked at her and lightly frowned.

But Kelsey didn't look at him at all, continuing to smile at Andy.

Andy's gaze shifted between Jack and Kelsey a couple of times before he understood.Â 

Andy said, "In that case, I won't be polite. I think Ms. Jose has excellent taste, befitting the daughter of the Jose family. My wife's birthday is coming up, and I'm at a loss for what to get her. If Ms. Jose has some free time later, would you like to accompany me to pick out a gift?"

"Of course, I'd be honored," Kelsey agreed readily and cheerfully.

In the Landon family, as soon as Isabella entered, the Landon family's servant greeted her, "Ms. Miller, you're finally here."

Seeing the servant's anxious expression, Isabella asked, "How is Matthew?"

"His mood has stabilized, but he hasn't eaten anything since last night, not even a sip of water. Madam is very worried and has been eagerly waiting for you to come."

Isabella glanced upstairs. "I'll go check on him."

"Yes, please."

The servant opened the bedroom door and softly said, "Mr.Landon, Ms. Miller is here."

As soon as the words were spoken, Matthew rushed out of the room.

He stared intently at Isabella and quickly typed a string of words on his phone: [ I'm sorry, Isabella. I lost control yesterday. I deserve to be punished.]

Isabella read the words and said calmly, "It's okay now."

Matthew typed again on his phone: [ Please don't be mad at me. I will try to control my temper in the future and won't force you to do anything you don't want to do. Forgive me, Isabella.]

"You shouldn't apologize to me. You should apologize to that maid," Isabella said. "I think she must have been terribly frightened."

The scenes from that day were still vivid in her mind.

Just thinking about the handful of hair Matthew had grabbed made Isabella's scalp tingle, let alone the maid who had actually lost that hair.

As a bystander, Isabella had been terrified. She couldn't imagine the psychological impact on the maid.

The servant chimed in, "Ms. Miller, you misunderstand Mr.Landon. After he calmed down, he did apologize. Madam also gave the maid a long vacation, with her salary paid as usual during the break. Additionally, Madam gave her some compensation."

"Really?" Hearing this, Isabella felt a bit relieved.

The servant continued, "Mr.London, you haven't eaten all day. Now that Ms. Miller is here, why don't you go downstairs and have something to eat?"

Matthew looked at Isabella.

Isabella said, "You should eat something."

Like an obedient child, Matthew immediately nodded and went downstairs to eat.

###chapter 121 Was She Too Much?

As she descended the stairs, the sound of a car engine came from outside.

Isabella and Matthew had just reached the dining room door when they heard a servant call out, "Mr. Landon?"

Isabella paused in her steps, feeling a slight surprise upon seeing Sebastian.

Although she wasn't clear about the affairs of the Landon family, she had only knew that Sebastian did not have a good relationship with the Landon family.

The last time Sebastian had visited, he had only stayed for a moment before finding an excuse to leave.

He was even more indifferent towards his younger brother, Matthew.

'So why is Sebastian here now?' she thought.

Matthew's expression was also surprised upon seeing Sebastian.

Unable to speak, he typed on his phone:[Sebastian, did you come to see me?]

"See you?" Sebastian glanced at Matthew with indifference, not bothering to hide his disdain.Â  He said,"You're overthinking it. I didn't come to see you."

As he spoke, his gaze fell on Isabella's face, and he asked, as if no one else were present, "Are you ready? Can we go?"

Isabella was speechless.

Matthew also looked down at her.

Suddenly, Isabella felt a tight grip on her hand.

It was Matthew who was holding her wrist.

Matthew looked at Isabella with a pleading gaze, his eyes filled with caution, as if he feared she would run away if he let go.

Sebastian frowned slightly at this scene.

Isabella said, "I need to have a meal with Matthew."

"He's not a child. Does he need someone to accompany him for a meal?" Sebastian's tone was sharp.

"I promised Mr. Landon and Mrs. Landon that I would stay with Matthew during this time," Isabella said, looking into Sebastian's eyes. "Mr. Landon, thank you for bringing me here. I can't leave just yet, so you don't need to worry about me."

Upon hearing this, Matthew's lips curved into a smile. He typed on his phone: [Sebastian, don't worry. I'll take good care of Isabella and make sure she gets home safely. You don't need to worry.]

Sebastian's gaze lingered on Isabella's face for a few seconds before shifting to Matthew.

Isabella told him not to worry, and Matthew told him not to be concerned.

'It feels like I'm meddling,' he thought.

His eyes swept over their clasped hands, and Sebastian felt a pang of discomfort.

"Fine. I guess I was meddling."

With that, Sebastian turned and strode out of the Landon family villa.

As his car drove out of the Landon family villa, his phone rang.

"Mr. Landon, we've found what you were looking for. On the night of the gathering at your house, Isabella was indeed the last to leave. Three cameras in your villa area captured her, and I've sent you the videos."

After hanging up, a few seconds later, several surveillance videos were sent over.

The three videos were from different locations and times.

In the footage from the camera closest to his house, Isabella was running with her hair disheveled.

In the second video, her pace had noticeably slowed, and she appeared somewhat dazed.

The last video was from the entrance of the villa area.

In the footage, Isabella walked slowly, seemingly unwell, stopping to rest every few steps.

After leaving the villa area, she squatted by the roadside for a long time.

It wasn't until a black taxi stopped in front of Isabella that she stood up, got in the car, and disappeared from the camera's view along with the vehicle.

Sebastian watched the three surveillance videos repeatedly.

He remembered that he had been out of control and acted wildly that night.

But the next morning, Vanessa had woken up in his arms, full of energy, with no signs of any marks on her body.

He had never doubted it, simply because it all seemed so reasonable.

At this moment, Isabella's mind was filled with the look in Sebastian's eyes as he left.

She was wondering if she had gone too far.

After all, Sebastian had been quite good to her.

A hand waved in front of her eyes.

Isabella snapped back to reality and saw Matthew's face.

He handed her his phone, which had a line of text on it: [ What's wrong?]

Isabella shook her head, saying, "Nothing."

Seeing that he was almost done eating, Isabella said, "If you don't have anything else to do later, I'll head back first."

Matthew typed on his phone: [Next week's graduation ceremony, I haven't bought my clothes yet. Will you come with me?]

Thinking of the twenty thousand dollars, Isabella had no choice but to nod in agreement.

At the mall, Matthew was picking out clothes and Isabella stood by his side.

The sales assistant, Donna Martin, a young and elegant girl, followed Matthew closely, enthusiastically recommending outfits. Her eyes frequently glanced at Matthew's face.

"I think your fair complexion would look great in this tailcoat suit," Donna said, taking the suit off the rack and looking at Matthew with sparkling eyes.

Matthew glanced at it and then turned to look at Isabella.

He was asking her with his eyesÂ what she thought.

Isabella took a look and said, "I think you'd look more approachable and sunny in something casual."

Matthew smiled, seemingly agreeing with her, and immediately pointed to a beige casual outfit on the rack.

Isabella then nodded.

Matthew asked Donna to take it down and went to the fitting room.

As soon as the fitting room door closed, Donna's expression changed. She turned around and scrutinized Isabella.

Then she smiled and said, "You're really lucky, sis. Your boyfriend is so handsome and rich."

Donna's tone suggested that Isabella was out of her league.

"He's not my boyfriend," Isabella explained calmly.

She ignored Donna's other comments.

Hearing this, Donna's eyes lit up. "Judging by your outfits, you two don't look like a couple. Are you his housekeeper?"

Isabella frowned.

Before she could say anything, Matthew came out of the fitting room.

Donna immediately plastered a smile on her face and showered Matthew with compliments.

But Matthew didn't even glance at Donna. He walked straight to Isabella and slightly spread his arms, showing off the outfit to her.

His eyes were full of anticipation for her praise.

Isabella saw Donna pouting unhappily behind him.

Isabella smiled and said, "It looks good."

She didn't offer any more praise.

Matthew, however, seemed to take it as the highest compliment, his smile spreading like sunshine.

Donna's face turned dark.

The store was beautifully decorated, but the atmosphere made Isabella feel suffocated.

Donna's disdain was written all over her face.

Isabella said to Matthew, "I want to go buy a cup of bubble tea."

Matthew nodded and typed on his phone: [ "You go ahead. I'll come find you after I pay.]

"Okay."

Isabella nodded and breathed a sigh of relief as she walked out of the store.

As soon as she left, Donna immediately approached Matthew, thinking the coast was clear and she could introduce more styles to him, maybe even get his contact information.

"Mr. Landon..." Donna began, but was met with a slap to the face.

With a loud smack, Donna was knocked to the ground.

The other sales assistants in the store, instead of helping,Â but looked on with expressions of satisfaction.

###chapter 122 She Deserved It

Primarily, because the new girl, Donna, had no sense of propriety.

Whenever she saw a male customer who was both handsome and wealthy, Donna would immediately cling to him.

Because of this, she had stolen quite a few clients from her colleagues.

Her colleagues had frequently reported this to the store manager.

However, the men seemed to fall for Donna's tricks, being coaxed into submission. And she brought in substantial revenue for the store and even became the top salesperson for a time.

The store manager was at a loss as to what to do with her.

Unexpectedly, today Donna encountered someone she couldn't handle.

When Matthew slapped her, the other employees secretly cheered.

They all stood at a distance, watching the scene unfold, afraid of being implicated by Donna.

"Mr. Landon," Donna said, covering her face with one hand, her tears brimming as she looked at Matthew.

Matthew's gaze swept coldly over her face, saying, "Who do you think you are, daring to mock my person?"

His voice was somewhat hoarse, and his speech was no longer as fluent as before.

Donna was stunned. "You can talk?"

Earlier, she had seen Matthew communicating by typing on his phone and had assumed he was mute.

She hadn't expected Matthew to be able to speak.

However, his voice didn't quite match his appearance.

At this moment, the store manager arrived upon hearing the commotion.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Landon. This is a new sales associate in our store. If there was any inadequacy in our service, please forgive us."

Seeing this, Matthew decided not to say more.

After all, he had already slapped Donna, which was enough to vent Isabella's anger.

In the end, another employee processed his purchase.

The store manager personally escorted Matthew to the door, apologizing profusely.

Once Matthew left, the store manager breathed a sigh of relief.

Donna immediately burst into tears and said, "Manager, I really didn't do anything. Mr. Landon is just too hard to please!"

The manager was about to say something when her phone rang.

When she saw the number on the screen, the manager's expression immediately became solemn. She carefully answered, "Hello, Mr. Robinson."

After hearing Andrew Robinson's words, the manager turned to look at the tearful Donna with a complex expression.

"Yes, I understand. Don't worry, I will handle it."

After hanging up, the manager walked up to Donna and said, "You're fired."

Donna was stunned. "What?"

"Orders from above. This time, you've really offended someone you shouldn't have." With that, the manager shook her head, sighed, and walked away.

Isabella had just gotten her bubble tea when Matthew approached.

"Did you get everything you need?" Isabella looked at the bag in his hand and asked, "Why didn't you have them deliver it?"

Rich people usually buy a lot and have the store deliver it to their home.

Matthew, however, handed the bag directly to her.

Isabella thought he wanted her to carry it, so she reached out to take it.

Matthew opened the bag, revealing a black velvet dress inside.

Isabella was a bit slow to react, saying, "For me?"

Matthew nodded and pushed the bag into her hands, typing on his phone: [You'll look great in it.]

Isabella waved her hand and said, "I don't need it."

Before she could finish her sentence, Donna came running towards them.

Seeing this, Matthew frowned, his eyes filled with displeasure.

To their surprise, Donna wasn't heading for him this time but ran straight to Isabella.

As soon as she reached Isabella, Donna grabbed her hand and cried, "Miss, I was blind and didn't mean to say those things. I can't lose this job. Please, give me another chance."

Isabella was stunned, completely unable to understand what she was saying. Donna glanced at Matthew and said, "Mr. Landon, I already know I was wrong, and you've already slapped me. My face is all swollen now. Haven't you vented your anger enough?"

Isabella saw that Donna's face was indeed badly swollen.

At this moment, the five finger marks on her cheek were clearly visible.

This was Matthew's doing.

Isabella looked at Matthew in astonishment, only to see him staring at Donna with a grim expression.

No matter how pitifully Donna cried, his eyes remained indifferent.

Seeing that pleading with Matthew was useless, Donna clung tightly to Isabella's hand and said, "Miss, I really know I was wrong. Please forgive me this time. I really can't afford to be fired!"

"Fired?" Isabella looked at Matthew.

In desperation, Donna gritted her teeth and knelt down with a thud, saying, "Is it enough if I kowtow and apologize to you?"

With that, she didn't care about anything else and started banging her head on the ground.

The crowd of onlookers grew larger, pointing and whispering about Isabella and Matthew.

In the end, Donna was dragged away by the mall security.

The crowd gradually dispersed as well.

Isabella's bubble tea had gone cold.

She asked Matthew, "She didn't really say anything about me. Isn't firing her too severe?"

Matthew handed her his phone. [It wasn't me.]

"Then what about the slap mark on her face?"

Matthew didn't deny it and lowered his head to type on his phone.

[She deserved it.]

Isabella shook her head and said ,"First it was the Landon family's maid, and now it's the store's sales associate. Matthew, when did you become so irritable and quick-tempered?"

The Matthew of the past was gentle and kind.

Just standing there, he was like a ray of sunshine, bringing warmth to people.

Now, just looking at Matthew made Isabella feel a chill down her spine.

Seeing the fear in her eyes, Matthew wanted to reach out and hold her hand.

Isabella, however, was so frightened that she took two steps back.

Matthew's hand froze in the air.

"This dress is too expensive. I can't accept it," Isabella said. "I'll return it to the store."

With that, she walked towards the store, leaving Matthew behind.

After returning the dress, Isabella came out of the store to find Matthew waiting outside.

Seeing her, he immediately smiled and handed her his phone, saying: [Shall we go see a movie?]

Isabella shook her head. "I'm a bit tired today."

Matthew typed: [Then let me take you home.]

"There's no need."

As soon as Isabella finished speaking, the smile on Matthew's face gradually faded.

Afraid that he might have an episode, Isabella quickly said, "You promised me you wouldn't force me to do anything I don't want to do!"

Hearing this, Matthew suppressed his emotions and his expression softened. He typed: [Then I'll head back first. Be safe. Text me when you get to your dorm.]

"Okay." Isabella nodded, watching Matthew leave.

It was still early, so Isabella thought about wandering around nearby.

As she took the escalator down, she saw a familiar figure on the upward escalator opposite her.

Upon closer inspection, it was Jack.

And the one who was clinging to Jack was his fiancÃ©e, Nancy.

It looked like they were out shopping. Nancy smiled brightly and chatted excitedly with Jack.

Jack kept his head down, preoccupied with his phone, showing little reaction.

They didn't see Isabella, so she averted her gaze without greeting them.

Just as she walked out of the mall, a car slowly pulled up and stopped in front of her.

###chapter 123  A Poor Imitation

The car window rolled down, revealing Kelsey's face.

"Isabella, what a coincidence! Shopping alone?"

Isabella shook her head. "I'm here with Matthew. What about you?"

"I'm here with Andy to pick out a gift," Kelsey said, opening the car door. "If you don't have other plans, join me. After we're done with Andy's errand, I'll treat you to afternoon tea."

Isabella didn't have many friends, but she got along well with Kelsey.

So, Isabella didn't decline and got into her car.

After helping Andy pick out a gift, they stepped out and ran into Jack and Nancy.

The two seemed to have just finished shopping. Jack carried several bags, all from high-end brands judging by the logos.

Running into them wasn't particularly awkward.

The awkward part was the dress Nancy was wearing.

It was identical to the one Kelsey was wearing today.

The color and the style were exactly the same; Isabella even suspected the size was the same.

But Isabella remembered that when she saw her with Jack previously, she was wearing a different dress.

At that moment, Isabella thought, 'It's not the matching outfits that are awkward, but who looks worse in them.'

Nancy wasn't unattractive, but she always exuded a certain dowdiness. Isabella thought she was better suited to a more casual and simple style.

Kelsey's usual style leaned towards the ladylike. She had been the apple of her family's eye since childhood. It wasn't an exaggeration to say she was treated like a princess in Jose family.

Kelsey's style of clothing looked quite out of place on Nancy.

It wasn't that Nancy looked terrible in it. After all, it was a high-end dress with top-notch tailoring and design. But Nancy wearing it made it seem like she was deliberately imitating Kelsey.

As soon as Kelsey saw Nancy dressed like that, she laughed and said, "Well, Jack. How do you have the time to take your copycat fiancÃ©e out shopping for new clothes?"

Kelsey was openly mocking Nancy as an imitator.

Jack's face gradually darkened.

Nancy, however, laughed mockingly, glaring at Kelsey, and retorted, "Ms. Jose, you come from a wealthy family, but why are you so sharp-tongued? This dress isn't designed exclusively for you. Do you think you're the only one allowed to wear it?"

"This dress isn't designed for me, but do you believe that I can make sure you never wear it again?"

Nancy clearly didn't believe her. "Ms. Jose, such big talk. I'd like to see how you can make me take off this dress and never wear it again."

Kelsey smiled and wasted no words on her, turning her gaze to Jack. "Jack, did you hear that?"

Jack looked at her, frowning the entire time. "Ms. Jose, there's no need to make things difficult for my fiancÃ©e over a dress?"

"Jack, you're exaggerating. It was your fiancÃ©e who provoked me first," Kelsey said with a faint smile. "I hate it when people wear the same thing as me, especially people I dislike. Jack, you know what to do, right?"

Jack pressed his lips together and said nothing.

Behind Kelsey, there was not only the Jose family but also Zaire.

Even Sebastian, when it came down to it, would undoubtedly choose Kelsey.

Jack was nothing in comparison.

Nancy tugged at his hand and said, "Jack, we don't need to be afraid of her." Jack was silent for a moment, then turned to her and said, "Nancy, this dress doesn't suit you. I'll buy you a new one."

With that, he took Nancy's hand and led her into a nearby store.

"Jack!" Nancy pulled away from his hold. "Jack, are you really that afraid of her? We haven't done anything wrong. This dress doesn't belong to her. I like it, and I want to wear it!"

Jack's brow furrowed, his tone deepening. "Nancy, listen to me!"

"No!" Nancy was determined to stand her ground against Kelsey.

Seeing the situation escalating, Jack took out his phone. After a few moments, he said, "I've booked tickets for tonight."

Nancy was taken aback. "To where?"

"Back home."

Nancy's eyes widened in disbelief. She immediately refused, "I don't want to go back home!"

'No way! I've only just made it out of the backwoods, and I've only just stepped into a new world; I can't just go back like this,' Nancy thought.

Jack pressed his lips together. "Either we go home, or you change out of that dress."

Tears welled up in Nancy's eyes. "Jack."

Jack said nothing more and went into the store. He quickly bought a new dress and handed it to Nancy. "Change into this. I'll wait outside."

Nancy took the dress, feeling her face burn as if she had been slapped.

She looked up at Kelsey, who was watching her.

Kelsey didn't mock her; her gaze was indifferent.

As if Kelsey were watching the circus indifferently.

"Fine, I'll change!" Nancy gritted her teeth and went to change.

Jack looked at Kelsey. "Ms. Jose, is this enough?"

Kelsey raised an eyebrow, didn't answer Jack's question, but took Isabella's hand and walked away.

Not long after they left, Nancy came out.

She had changed into the new dress with the one she had taken off in her hand.

"Nancy." Jack walked over.

Just as he was about to take her hand, Nancy threw the dress at him.

Jack was stunned.

Nancy, with red-rimmed eyes, looked at him and said, "Jack, no matter what happened before, you always stood by me, helped me and protected me. But now, I've just arrived at this place and have already been humiliated by Kelsey several times. It's bad enough that I'm humiliated, and you didn't even stand up for me!"

"Nancy..." Jack tried to explain.

But Nancy didn't give him a chance, cutting him off, "From now on, I don't want to have anything to do with you!"

With that, Nancy ran off.

For the next two days, Isabella went to the Landon family as usual to comfort Matthew.

In fact, she didn't need to comfort Matthew much. The Landon family servants always said, "As long as Ms. Miller is here, Mr. Landon is happy."

As her pregnancy progressed, Isabella's nausea had subsided. However, she was now plagued by inexplicable fatigue, which had become increasingly severe in recent days.

She had only been sitting on the sofa for a short while before she fell asleep.

In a daze, Isabella felt as if someone was watching her.

But when she opened her eyes, everything seemed normal.

Rubbing her temples, Isabella slowly got up and realized that her surroundings had changed.

She had fallen asleep on the sofa in the side room, but now she woke up in Matthew's bedroom.

A faint scent lingered in the air, like the smell of lilacs, which was quite soothing. Yet, for some reason, despite that she had just woken up, Isabella still felt incredibly fatigued.

###chapter 124  Don't You Have a Clue?

Isabella emerged from the bedroom, finding the entire villa enveloped in silence.

Â At this hour every day, Matthew would seclude himself in his studio for creation.

Â Once he shut himself in, it would be for several hours and only come out in the evening.

Â Isabella had never set foot in his studio. The servants of the Landon family mentioned that Matthew's studio was his private sanctuary. Not even Charles and Emma were allowed in, let alone anyone else.

She picked up her bag and coat and left the Landon family estate.

Â Just as she stepped out of the gate, a car horn beeped behind her.Â 

Startled, Isabella turned to see a silver-gray car approaching.Â 

The window rolled down, revealing a face she hadn't seen in a long time. 'Who is he ?' Isabella thought.

"Forgot me so soon?" Leo sat in the car, raising an eyebrow and smiling at her. Isabella was at a loss for words. She had indeed forgotten Leo's name, but she still recognized his face.

"What are you doing here?" Leo, still in his car and dressed in a suit, looked nothing like his former rogue self.

"Get in," Leo opened the car door, his expression somewhat grave. "I have something to tell you."

Â Standing under the sun, Isabella felt a bit dizzy. She hesitated for a couple of seconds before bending down to get in.

Â As the car drove off, Leo glanced at her and asked, "You don't look well. Are you sick?"

Isabella shook her head and said, "I'm fine. What do you have to tell me? Is it about Samantha?"Â 

Leo glanced at her again. "You are retty smart. " Isabella's heart skipped a beat. "Do you have news about Samantha?"

Leo furrowed his brows. "About three days ago, I received a call from her."

Â He pulled over to the side of the road and retrieved an old black phone from the deepest part of the glove compartment.

Â After turning it on, Leo found a recorded call and pressed the play button.

"Hello, who is this?"

"Leo, Leo, help me!"

"Samantha?"

"Help me. I'm being held captive. Help me!"

The recording ended.

Samantha's final scream sent chills down Isabella's spine. Â 

Leo, with a furrowed brow, said, "The number belongs to Samantha's hometown. After that, the number couldn't be reached again."

Isabella looked at him. "Do you know about Samantha and Matthew?"

Â "I do," Leo nodded. "From the beginning, I said Matthew wasn't sincere. If Samantha hadn't schemed, how would Matthew have fallen into her trap? Given Matthew's nature, once he realized he was being played, how could he possibly let her off easily?"

A chill ran down Isabella's spine. "Are you saying Matthew is holding her captive?"

Â "I didn't say that and it's your speculation," Leo smiled at her, pausing for a moment. "Isabella, you really don't look well. Let me take you to the hospital."

Just as he was about to start the car, a black car drove up from the side and screeched to a halt in front of Leo's car.

Â The door opened. Sebastian walked over, immediately opening the passenger door and unbuckling Isabella's seatbelt.Â 

She stared at him, momentarily too stunned to react.Â 

Sebastian looked up and met her gaze with his deep, dark eyes. "Are you getting out yourself, or should I carry you?"

Isabella hesitated for just a couple of seconds before Sebastian reached out to pick her up.

Â At the same time, her anther hand was grasped by Leo.

Â Leo smiled at Sebastian. "Mr. Landon, long time no see."

Sebastian ignored him, his gaze fixed on Isabella, with a storm seemingly brewing in his eyes.

Â Leo spoke again, "Mr. Landon, everything should follow the order of arrival. I haven't finished my conversation with Isabella."

Sebastian finally glanced at him. "What, isn't the Anderson family's mess enough for you to handle? You still have time to meddle in others' affairs?" Leo was momentarily speechless.

Sebastian's eyes fell on the hand Leo had on Isabella, his tone devoid of emotion. He said, "Let go!" His voice was filled with danger.Â 

Considering how much their future cooperation depended on Sebastian, Leo hesitated for a moment before finally releasing his grip.

Almost the instant Leo let go, Isabella found herself lifted into the air as Sebastian pulled her out of the car.Â 

"Mr. Landon," Isabella exclaimed softly.

'With cars passing by on the street, if anyone sees us, Sebastian would have a hard time explaining to Vanessa,' Isabella thought.

Sebastian seemed completely unconcerned. With a stern face, he placed Isabella in his car.

Â He shut the door but didn't release her, his hands still gripping her waist, his eyes never leaving her face. He coldly instructed the driver, "Drive!"

The car began to move slowly, and the partition in the middle gradually rose, dividing the space inside.Â 

This made Isabella feel the air grow thinner. She held her breath, not daring to make a sound. While Sebastian continued to stare at her, his gaze intense enough to bore a hole through her.

Â Isabella's face turned red from holding her breath, but he didn't budge.

Finally, Isabella couldn't hold it any longer, saying, "Mr. Landon, if you have something to say, can you let go of me first?"Â 

She tried to push Sebastian away. Sebastian held her and she was practically sitting on his lap, which was an uncomfortably intimate position.

But Sebastian's arms were like iron bands, tightly holding her, giving her no room to struggle.Â 

Isabella, out of options, looked at him with a flushed face. "Mr. Landon, why are you staring at me like this? Did I do something wrong?"

"Don't you have a clue?" Sebastian's words left Isabella speechless. Though Sebastian appeared calm, Isabella felt he was waiting for something.

"If I've done something wrong, please tell me, Mr. Landon," Isabella mustered the courage to say. After staring at him for so long, she found herself less afraid of him.

Sebastian remained silent for a long time before speaking, "Vanessa told me everything about that night."Â 

Isabella's eyelashes fluttered, a hint of guilt flashing in her eyes. She blinked, feigning innocence. "What night? Mr. Landon, I don't understand what you're talking about."

After years of navigating the business world, Sebastian had developed a keen eye.Â 

The fleeting emotion in Isabella's eyes did not escape him.Â 

Sebastian thought he already knew the answer. He just needed to find a way to make Isabella admit it.

With the answer in hand, Sebastian felt a weight lift off his chest.

Â He smirked, freeing one hand to slip under Isabella's shirt, his eyes never leaving her face. "Don't understand? Then let's see if you can remember."

With that, Isabella found herself pressed against the leather seat. Sebastian hovered over her, their noses almost touching, his hot breath washing over her.Â 

His hand didn't stop, his fingers brushing over her abdomen, sending electric shocks through her.

Isabella tensed and widened her eyes. "Mr. Landon."

Â "Didn't you say you don't understand?" Sebastian said, "Then let me help you remember."

###chapter 125  Deceiving Her

Isabella was stunned.

When Sebastian brought up that night, she was confused and suspicious.

That was because she thought Vanessa couldn't have told Sebastian about it.

But if Vanessa didn't tell Sebastian, then Sebastian's current behavior was inexplicable.

If Sebastian didn't know about that night, with his reserved nature, he wouldn't be so blatant in touching her now.

Sebastian's hand moved over Isabella's abdomen, gradually moving upward.

Isabella shivered in fear and said tremblingly, "Mr. Landon, what you're doing is unfair to Vanessa."

Sebastian frowned. "If she could send you to my bed, she should have expected this day."

Isabella was shocked.

'Vanessa sent me to Sebastian's bed?' Isabella thought.Â 

"Isabella, it really was you that night!"

Isabella saw the emotional change in Sebastian, as if someone had cleared the fog. A smile gradually spread across his eyes, and his actions became more urgent and bold.

"It was that feeling." Sebastian's eyes darkened, even showing a hint of joy.

At that moment, Isabella suddenly realized that Sebastian was deceiving her from the beginning.

She struggled in Sebastian's arms. "Mr. Landon, there must be some misunderstanding. I don't know what you're talking about. Please let me go."

Sebastian pinned her hands above her head, his nose gently brushing against hers. "You still not admit it, Isabella?"

Isabella suddenly felt a tightness in her chest. Her mind was buzzing and she almost lost the ability to think.

Sebastian also stopped his hand, his dark eyes gleaming as he looked at her. "You're already reacting."

At this moment, Sebastian was completely different from his usual self. His eyes were filled with a storm, his face full of desire, and his hands were unrelenting.

Isabella was mortified and turned her face away, unable to look at him. She said, "Mr. Landon, that night was a misunderstanding. We didn't do anything. Please let me go."

Her chin tightened as Sebastian turned her face back.

"Isabella, you're really not good at lying."

Isabella's eyes widened, staring at the car roof.

A warm touch came to her lips. It was Sebastian's kiss, domineering and passionate.

"It hurts," Isabella murmured.

Sebastian let go of her, only to find her face pale as paper, with beads of sweat on her forehead.

Isabella clutched her stomach with a painful expression.

Sebastian immediately picked her up, holding her in his arms.

He instructed the driver to go to the hospital while tidying Isabella's clothes and hair.

Sebastian's movements were extremely gentle. Isabella leaned against him, feeling unwell but strangely reassured.

After tidying her clothes, Sebastian's hand rested on her lower abdomen again.

"Does it hurt a lot?" Sebastian's voice came from above.

Isabella bit her lip, not speaking.

Sebastian held her tighter and said, "Sorry, I got too excited."

Isabella's heart raced.

'Sebastian knew it was me that night, so he was excited.

'If he knows the child is his, would he be even more excited?' Isabella thought.

Isabella's mind was filled with thoughts. Sebastian's palm pressed tightly against her lower abdomen, his expression serious.

"Mr. Landon, what are you doing?" Isabella couldn't help but ask.

Sebastian answered earnestly, "Telling him to behave well."

'He could be so childish,' Isabella thought.

Isabella looked up, meeting Sebastian's deep, unfathomable eyes.

"What's wrong?" Sebastian's concern was written all over his face. "Does it hurt badly?"

Isabella shook her head and blushed, saying, "Mr. Landon, can you put me down first?"

"No!" Sebastian refused without thinking. "You can't move now. I'll carry you to see the doctor when we get to the hospital."

Besides, he had finally gotten to hold her, and he was reluctant to let go.

He had imagined this scene many times.

Isabella couldn't persuade Sebastian. And with her stomach aching, she didn't have the energy to argue with him.

So, she went along with Sebastian's wishes, leaning against him with peace of mind.

At the hospital, Sebastian carried her to see Jessica.

After the examination, Jessica sternly asked Sebastian, "Didn't I tell you last time, no strenuous activity!"

Sebastian pondered for a moment and asked seriously, "Does kissing count as strenuous?"

Fortunately, the baby was fine.

Jessica said that Isabella's discomfort was likely due to her being too nervous and excited.

"Nervous and excited?" Sebastian looked at Isabella thoughtfully.

Isabella's face remained flushed. "I didn't feel excited."

Before she finished speaking, Sebastian took her wrist.

Sebastian intended to pull her over, but thinking of the baby, he was much gentler. So he sat closer with her.

"Let's talk."

Isabella didn't know what Sebastian wanted to talk about.

He probably wanted to talk about that night.

So before he could speak, Isabella took the initiative. "Mr. Landon, that night was an accident. I didn't take it seriously, so please don't take it to heart either."

Sebastian looked at her and said, "You seem to be quite carefree."

'It's not that I'm carefree.

'I didn't expect that night to happen either,' Isabella thought.

Besides, Sebastian had a fiancÃ©e. She didn't want to be the one to ruin someone's marriage, so she tried hard to distance herself from him.

But for some reason, the more she tried to distance herself, the more she got involved.

After a moment of silence, Sebastian asked, "Are you planning to marry Matthew?"

Isabella was stunned for a moment and shook her head.

His expression softened slightly. " You still can't let him go?"

Isabella still shook her head.

Her two denials cleared the gloom from Sebastian's face.

He reached out, pulling her onto his lap.

Isabella tried to get down, but Sebastian held her waist.

"Isabella, be with me?"

Isabella looked at Sebastian, her mind blank.

Sebastian tightened his arm and continued, "Leave the Landon family. I'll repay the forty thousand dollars for you."

Isabella was surprised. "You know everything?"

After asking, she felt it was redundant.

Jack saw her that night. For people like them, it was not difficult to inquire about something at the casino.

If Jack knew it, then Sebastian would know too.

"I know everything about you."

Isabella was silent.

She didn't believe Sebastian's words.

For example, Sebastian didn't know about the baby.

Sebastian held Isabella from the side. He liked her scent, faint but always making him feel warm inside. It was as if his wandering heart had finally found a peaceful and gentle harbor.

Sebastian knew Isabella was the woman he wanted.

"Isabella, give me a straightforward answer!" He buried his head in her neck, his breath heating Isabella's skin.

Isabella looked out the window, her eyes a bit dazed.

Undoubtedly, at this moment, she was a bit moved.

She had given her body to Sebastian, and the baby in her belly was also Sebastian's.

If she talked it out with Sebastian, they might really have a good outcome.

Isabella was on the verge of a response when her phone rang.

###chapter 126  Rejection

This was a number without a note. Isabella answered, "Hello."

"Isabella, long time no see. Would you like to meet up for some afternoon tea?"

It was Vanessa.

Hearing her voice, Isabella looked at Sebastian first.

Since the phone wasn't on speaker, Sebastian didn't know it was Vanessa calling.

"Do you need something?" Isabella felt inexplicably guilty.

"I do have something to share with you. I might be pregnant."

Isabella felt as if she had woken from a dream, instantly alert, with a chill rising from the bottom of her heart.

Her hand holding the phone tightened unconsciously. "Really? Congratulations."

"So, do you have time to grab a cup of tea?"

Isabella lowered her eyes. "Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have time."

"Alright. Maybe another time?"

"Yeah."

After hanging up, Isabella's expression wasn't quite right.

Sebastian asked, "Who was on the phone?"

Isabella didn't answer him and no longer avoided his gaze. Her voice returned to calm. "Mr. Landon, don't say such ridiculous things again."

"Isabella."

"No matter how many times you say it, it's impossible between us." Isabella looked out the window. "Mr. Landon, please respect yourself."

Isabella's cold rejection was like a sword, mercilessly wounding Sebastian.

Sebastian clenched his jaw and gripped Isabella's wrist. "Why are you rejecting me?"

Clearly, she didn't want to reconcile with Matthew. Clearly, Isabella had feelings for him.

Sebastian couldn't understand.

Isabella wanted to completely cut off his thoughts and said, "Because I still want the child to acknowledge their heritage."

A sharp glint flashed in Sebastian's eyes. He said, "But you just said you didn't want to link with Matthew anymore. Isabella, isn't this reason too far-fetched?"

"This child isn't Matthew's."

Sebastian furrowed his brows, thought for a moment, and said, "Is it Leo's?"

Isabella was speechless.

She didn't understand why Sebastian's thought process was so peculiar.

But now she wanted to get rid of Sebastian, so this seemed like the best reason.

Isabella didn't deny it, lowered her head, and considered it as tacit agreement

Sebastian's eyes were tightly fixed on her. "Did you have something with Matthew?"

"Yes, I have been with other men as well as Matthew. Mr. Landon, I'm just weak-willed. In other aspects, I'm not as conservative as you think!"

"I didn't fancy Leo before, so I never told him about the child. But today he came to me, and I found that he had changed. I like him now, so I want to use the child to reconcile with him."

"Mr. Landon, we're all adults. You wouldn't have developed different feelings for me just because of that night of sex, would you?"

"If I can't reconcile with Leo, I'll consider being with you, okay?"

"Isabella!" Sebastian gritted his teeth as he called her name. "I told you, never belittle yourself!"

"I'm not belittling myself. I was born this way. Mr. Landon, it's you who has been idealizing me."

Sebastian's gaze was almost murderous.

After a while, he finally let go of her hand and placed Isabella back in her seat.

The warmth on Sebastian's face was gone, leaving only endless coldness. He said, "Isabella, as an adult, you need to be responsible for every word you say and you know that, right?"

Isabella nodded and replied, "I know."

"I won't believe your one-sided words. I will investigate everything you just said. If I find any falsehoods, I won't let you off easily."

Isabella's heart skipped a beat, and she pursed her lips without saying anything.

Sebastian looked at her for a moment and told the driver to pull over. "Get out!"

Isabella was speechless.

She finally understood what extreme passion and extreme indifference meant.

In the hospital, Vanessa was there for a check-up. Today was the day to check if the fertilized egg had implanted.

Unexpectedly, she ran into Isabella and Sebastian at the entrance.

Vanessa watched Sebastian lovingly carry Isabella into the car and saw the car door close. She didn't know what they were doing inside, but she was insanely jealous.

Clearly, she was Sebastian's fiancÃ©e now, but Sebastian never looked at her properly and always had Isabella in his heart.

Even though Isabella had left the Landon Group, it didn't stop him from liking Isabella.

'Did Isabella tell Sebastian about that night?' Vanessa thought.

Vanessa looked at the tightly closed car door and took out her phone to call Isabella.

Vanessa deliberately told Isabella about her pregnancy, partly to test Isabella's reaction and partly to indirectly warn Isabella not to mention that night to Sebastian. She was indeed Sebastian's true fiancÃ©e.

But in reality, Vanessa hadn't had the check-up yet.

The pregnancy was something she made up.

"Ms. Field, your report is ready." The doctor's voice brought Vanessa back to reality.

She immediately asked, "How is it? Did it implant?"

The doctor regretfully told Vanessa, "The implantation failed."

"What!" Vanessa slumped in the chair, unable to recover for a long time.

'Why did it work for Isabella the first time?

'I had carefully planned for so long, but it failed,' Vanessa thought.

"How have you been feeling lately? Have you been drinking?" The doctor tried to find the cause of the failure.

Vanessa snapped back and asked, "Can't drink?"

"You can't, because this is a special period. I told you to be careful with your diet and not to drink alcohol. Did you forget?"

Vanessa looked annoyed.

She didn't just forget.

She had completely forgotten.

That day, as she watched Isabella get into Sebastian's car, she was in a bad mood and thought about relaxing at a bar.

ButÂ  when she saw the alcohol, Vanessa got tempted.

She thought that drinking a little wouldn't hurt, but she ended up drinking a lot.

"So, the reason it didn't work is because I drank?"

"It's hard to say. But generally, drinking is strictly prohibited during the preparation period."

Vanessa was full of regret.

She drank quite a bit that day and even went to the bathroom to throw up several times.

"Your ovulation period is coming soon. If you want to try again, there's still a chance."

Vanessa clenched the report in her hand.

At the Moon Club, Zaire sat on the sofa, holding a wine glass in one hand and resting the other on his knee, watching Sebastian with interest.

Someone who didn't know might think Zaire was eyeing some beauty.

But in fact, sitting opposite him was Sebastian, a straight man.

Finally, Zaire couldn't stand it anymore, pinched his brow, and said, "What's wrong with you? You called me out in the middle of the night, no drinking, no girls, just working?"

About an hour ago, Sebastian suddenly called him, asking him to come to Moon Club.

Zaire's first thought when he got the call was, 'You workaholic finally know how to enjoy life!'

This was the first time Sebastian had asked him to come to Moon Club since Zaire had known him.

So, Zaire picked a flashy shirt and came over excitedly.

But there was no enjoyment.

Sebastian had all his documents moved here. Zaire had been sitting there for nearly an hour, dryly watching him work for an hour.

###chapter 127 Mr. Jose Saved Me

Sebastian ignored him, completely absorbed in his work.

Zaire put down his glass and stood up to leave.

Sebastian finally looked up from the pile of documents. "Where are you going?"

"I'm going to find some fun. If I stay here with you any longer, even if you don't go crazy, I will."

With that, Zaire opened the door.

He happened to run into Leo passing by outside.

Leo, dressed in all black, had a seductive woman in his arms. Seeing Zaire, he paused slightly and greeted him with a smile, "What a coincidence, Zaire."

Zaire once had a passionate love affair with the eldest daughter of the Anderson family, Susan.

Back then, Leo was still a teenager.

He used to admire Zaire quite a bit, following him around all day calling him brother-in-law.

After Zaire and Susan broke up, Leo and Zaire rarely saw each other.

Meeting Leo again, Zaire couldn't help but feel a bit sentimental. He glanced at the woman in Leo's arms and frowned. "What are you doing here?"

"For business," Leo answered seriously.

"How old are you to talk about business?" Zaire thought he was joking.

"I'm already 26."

Zaire murmured, "Yeah, you're already 26. Time flies. I always thought of you as a kid."

As he spoke, he shook his head with a self-deprecating smile.

Leo patted the woman's shoulder, and she sensibly left.

"Zaire, my sister is coming back next week."

Zaire was stunned, a light flashed in his eyes but quickly disappeared. "She's been gone for so many years and it's about time she came back to visit."

Leo was about to say something more when Sebastian's voice came from inside the room.

"Is that Leo? Tell him to come in and I have something to ask him."

Zaire raised an eyebrow, stepped aside, and said to Leo, "Sebastian is in a bad mood today, be careful."

With that, Zaire patted Leo's shoulder and left.

Zaire originally intended to go find some fun.

But after talking to Leo for a few words, he suddenly lost interest.

He found a quiet place, stood by the window, and lit a cigarette.

The blue smoke covered the melancholy in Zaire's eyes. He seemed a bit distracted.

Zaire was about to dial Miley on his phone when the door of the adjacent room opened, and Nancy ran out in a miniskirt.

"You little slut, where you're going?" A drunk man followed closely, reaching out to grab Nancy.

Nancy screamed in fright.

She turned and saw Zaire, then ran over.

"Mr. Jose, save me!"

Nancy cried out, hiding behind Zaire.

Seeing this, the drunk man had to stop. He was too drunk to stand steadily, swaying back and forth in place.Â 

When he saw Zaire, his eyes widened.

Then he rubbed his eyes hard and put on a fawning smile. "Oh, it's Mr. Jose."

He pointed at Nancy behind Zaire and said, "If Mr. Jose likes this woman, I'll do you a favor and give her to you."

As he spoke, the drunk man grinned and lowered his voice, saying, "She's still a virgin, you know."

Zaire frowned, pulled Nancy out from behind him, and pushed her towards the drunk man. "I'm not interested, you enjoy."

With that, he turned to leave.

He pressed the elevator button. Behind him, he heard the drunk man's lecherous laughter and Nancy's cries for help.

"Mr. Jose, I'm Nancy, Jack's fiancÃ©e. Please save me. I beg you."

But no matter how Nancy called out, Zaire acted as if he didn't hear, and went straight into the elevator and went down.

Nancy was dragged back into the room by the drunk man.

When the door closed, the drunk man's hands roamed over her body.

Nancy neither cried nor screamed. She grabbed a bottle from the table and smashed it over the drunk man's head.

With a thud, the drunk man collapsed.

Zaire took the elevator down and waited in the lobby for about five minutes before he saw Jack rushing in.

"Mr. Jose, where's Nancy?" Jack looked anxious.

It was clear that Jack cared a lot about Nancy.

Zaire gave him the room number and used his VIP card to open the VIP elevator.

He and Jack walked in together.

Jack was still panting.

Zaire glanced at Jack and asked, "Does your fiancÃ©e work here?"

Jack froze for a moment, then shook his head. "No."

"Then why is she wearing the uniform here?"

Nancy wore a miniskirt, wearing a small tube top, makeup, and perfume.

She looked completely different from the cowering girl at the police station that day.

At first, Zaire didn't even recognize her as Nancy.

He hadn't intended to get involved, but he had some connection with Jack. After thinking it over, Zaire decided to call Jack.

Jack was also stunned, clearly not knowing why Nancy was here.

The elevator arrived.

Jack rushed out.

Zaire was a little late. When he walked into the room, he saw Nancy crouched in a corner crying, and Jack taking off his jacket to wrap around her before picking her up.

The floor was littered with broken bottles and spilled alcohol.

The drunk man lay in the mess, his head bleeding and unconscious.

Zaire raised an eyebrow slightly, surprised by the outcome.

Over there, Jack was already carrying Nancy over. He paused beside Zaire. "Mr. Jose, thank you for calling me."

Zaire replied indifferently, "No problem."

His eyes fell on Jack's arms.

Nancy's clothes were torn, and she was curled up in Jack's arms with tears streaming down her cheeks, looking very frightened.

When Zaire's gaze fell on her, Nancy lifted her eyelashes and looked back at him.

Zaire curled his lips slightly, as if he could see right through Nancy.

Nancy shivered and shrank further into Jack's arms.

Jack, feeling distressed, quickly carried Nancy away.

At the same time, Leo had been standing for ten minutes, but Sebastian was still working.

Finally, he couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Landon, did you need something?"

Sebastian paused, closed the file in his hand, and his eyes fell on the lipstick mark on Leo's collar. He frowned and asked, "What's going on with you and Isabella?"

He feltÂ really confused now.

Leo didn't answer immediately, thinking it over.

Then he said, "It's just what it is."

Sebastian scrutinized Leo. "What do you think about the child?"

Leo was even more puzzled.

Sebastian saw Leo's confusion. "You don't know?"

Leo's eyes flashed and he replied firmly, "I know."

"Then tell me, what are you going to do?"

Leo was speechless.

Even though Leo was smart and imaginative, he had no clue about what Sebastian was talking about.

'What child?

'What does it have to do with Isabella?

'And what does it have to do with me?

'Child, Isabella, me,' Leo thought.

Leo suddenly realized. "Isabella is pregnant?"

###chapter 128  How Many Men Are There

Sebastian squinted his eyes. "The child isn't yours?"

After so many years in business, if he couldn't tell that Leo was lying, he might as well quit.

'Should I say yes or no?' Leo thought.

While Leo was hesitating, Sebastian already drew a conclusion. "She has another man?"

Sebastian thought apart from Leo, Matthew, and him, Isabella had other men.

Leo was at a loss for words.

After a moment of silence, Leo said, "As far as I know, Isabella isn't a casual person."

"Really?" Sebastian looked cold, satring at Leo sharply. "Do you know her well?"

"Not really well, we've met a few times."

Leo's words sounded harsh to Sebastian.

"A few times?"

"Three or four times."

Sebastian's face turned dark instantly.

'Three or four times.

'Isabella had only been with me once.

'And it was an accident.

'If Isabella had been with Leo three or four times, then she must have been with Matthew even more.

'Isabella, oh Isabella, how many men do you have?' Sebastian thought.

Jack carried Nancy into the car and started the engine, driving away from Moon Club.

"Jack, where are we going?" Nancy asked from the back seat.

"To the hospital, you need to get your injuries treated." Jack's hands gripped the steering wheel, his expression serious.

Nancy said, "I'm fine. I don't want to go to the hospital."

Jack frowned. "Nancy, be good."

"You always tell me to be good, and I did listen to you, but you couldn't protect me." Nancy cried, "I don't want to listen to you anymore!"

She cried hard, reaching for the car door. "Pull over, I want to get out!"

Jack had no choice but to pull over.

He moved from the driver's seat to the back seat to comfort Nancy.

After seeing the tattered clothes on Nancy, Jack's eyes flared with anger. He grabbed Nancy's arm and asked, "Were you forced?"

Nancy was stunned, then shook her head. "No, the man tried to violate me, but I resisted fiercely, so he didn't succeed."

Jack sighed in relief, his voice softening,

"Why were you at that place, wearing their uniform?"

Nancy was less agitated now, but she was still crying, tears streaming down her face as she sobbed. She said, "After our fight, I wandered around aimlessly. I ended up there and saw they were hiring. The pay and benefits seemed good, so I thought I'd give it a try. I didn't expect it to be like this. I'm sorry, Jack."

Hearing this, Jack felt a wave of guilt and said, "I'm sorry, Nancy. I failed to take care of you and I let your parents down."

Nancy shook her head and hugged him. "It's not your fault. It's my moment of foolishness. Jack, I won't argue with you again."

Jack paused, then hugged her back. "Nancy, it's over now."

They hugged for a while until Nancy's emotions finally stabilized.

Then, Jack drove back to their place.

On the way, Nancy fell asleep in the back seat.

When they got home, Jack was reluctant to disturb her sleep, so he carried her inside.

As soon as he put Nancy on the bed, she opened her eyes.

She wrapped her arms around Jack's neck and said, "Jack, don't go. Stay with me."

Jack said, "I have work to do."

"But I'm still scared, can you stay with me a little longer?" Nancy pleaded softly.

Jack had no choice but to sit by her side for a while.

As time passed, Nancy still showed no sign of sleepiness.

Jack checked his watch and said, "I really need to get to work."

Nancy pouted, "Jack, can I play with your phone?"

Jack hesitated.

His phone contained many work files.

He usually didn't let others use it.

Jack took out another phone from the drawer. "You can use this one."

"I don't want that one." Nancy pushed it away and insisted, "I just want to look at your phone. Don't worry. I won't snoop around."

Nancy's eyes were filled with expectation, as if she would be disappointed if Jack refused.

Jack unlocked his phone and handed it to her. "Browse at will, but give it back when you're done."

Jack trusted Nancy, butÂ he was still cautious that she might accidentally access confidential files.

So, he watched over her.

Nancy first checked his social media accounts, then browsed through his private messages.

"So many messages from Mr. Landon?"

Jack said, "I'm Mr. Landon's assistant. My daily job is to solve all problems for Mr. Landon."

"Okay." Nancy nodded.

Then, Nancy tapped on his contact list.

Jack frowned slightly but said nothing.

His phone had thousands of contacts.

Nancy scrolled through them casually, then suddenly exclaimed, "Is this Mr. Jose's number?"

Jack glanced at it. "Yes."

"The Mr. Jose from tonight?"

"Yes." Jack looked at her and asked, "Are you done?"

"Yes." Nancy returned the phone to him. "I just want to make sure you don't have another girlfriend. Now I'm sure that you only have me."

Jack held the phone and looked at her deeply. "It's late and you should rest."

"Okay." This time Nancy was obedient and lay down. "Jack, you should rest early too. Goodnight."

Jack left her room, closed the door, and looked at his phone, frowning slightly.

As soon as he left, Nancy took out her phone and quickly noted down the number for Zaire that she had memorized.

The next day, Isabella bought some fruits to visit Nina.

At Nina's door, she rang the bell.

In no time, the door opened.

"Nina."

Standing before Isabella was a man who was shirtless, wearing slippers, with messy hair, and only a pair of shorts.

The man was very thin and looked much younger than Charlie.

Isabella was stunned for a couple of seconds, then grabbed a broom nearby and asked, "Who are you?"

She looked inside the house and asked, "Where's my sister?"

The man looked her up and down, then smiled, "You must be Isabella. I'm Raymond Wilson, Charlie's brother."

Charlie was from out of town. He stayed in Lakina after college for work.

When Nina married Charlie, Isabella was too young to care about Charlie's family.

She had heard Nina mention it twice, so Isabella only knew that Charlie's father had passed away and he had a mother, but she didn't know he had a brother named Raymond.

Isabella was still doubtful, but Raymond extended his hand. "Nice to meet you."

Isabella tightened her grip on the broom and took a step back. "Where's my sister?"

She still didn't believe Raymond.

###chapter 129  Much Prettier Than You

"Nina and my mom went to the grocery store. Why don't you come in and wait?" Raymond stepped aside, inviting her in.

Isabella ignored him, took out her phone, and dialed Nina's number.

The call was quickly answered, and Nina's voice came through. "Bella?"

"Nina, where are you?"

"I'm at the market." Nina's end was a bit noisy. "What's up?"

"I have nothing to do today, so I came to see you."

"I'll make lunch for you," Nina said, then remembered something. "Oh, by the way, Charlie's mom and brother are in Lakina and I haven't had a chance to tell you. I'm at the grocery store with his mom right now, and his brother Raymond is at home. If you run into him, don't be scared."

Isabella glanced at Raymond, thinking to herself, 'I've already run into him.'

But she didn't say that to Nina, she just said, "Got it."

After hanging up, Raymond asked, "So, did you confirm that I'm not a bad guy?"

Isabella frowned and still ignored him.

She had a prejudice against Charlie, so her first impression of Charlie's brother Raymond wasn't great either.

Isabella put the broom back in its place.

Raymond said, "Come in and wait. I'll get you some tea."

With that, he turned and went into the kitchen to pour some water.

Isabella hesitated for a moment, thinking it didn't look good to wait in the hallway, so she reluctantly stepped inside.

There were several more pairs of shoes on the shoe cabinet, including a pair with muddy soles.

Although the mud had long dried, moving the shoes would cause the dried mud to fall off easily, making a mess of the shoe cabinet.

Isabella searched for a while but couldn't find the pair of plush slippers she had worn before.

At this moment, Raymond came out with the water, asking, "Are you looking for shoes?"

Isabella stood up straight and said, "Yes."

"What kind of shoes? I'll find them for you," Raymond offered eagerly.

Isabella said, "A pair of pink and white plush slippers."

When she moved out, she took everything except for those slippers.

She remembered that last time when she came back, Nina had washed them clean and put them in the shoe cabinet.

Raymond thought for a moment and said, "I know where they are. I'll get them for you."

With that, Raymond went into the guest room.

After a while, he came out with a pair of slippers and placed them by Isabella's feet. "Is it this pair?"

Isabella looked down at the slippers, her delicate eyebrows slowly knitting together.

These slippers were originally rabbit-shaped, with two bunny ears on them.

But now, the bunny ears were gone.

Seeing her expression, Raymond explained, "My mom thought the ears were in the way, so she cut them off."

He handed her the glass of water. " Drink some water?"

Isabella didn't take the glass. She changed into the slippers and neatly placed her sneakers to the side.

The living room was a mess, especially the sofa.

A pillow was haphazardly placed on the sofa, a thin blanket half on the sofa and half on the floor.

In addition, Raymond's jacket and jeans were also on the sofa.

Even worse, a pair of his blue boxer shorts was hanging on the armrest.

At the sight of this, Isabella's brows were deeply furrowed.

Raymond quickly ran past her, stuffing the shorts and jeans into the thin blanket. He rolled up the blanket and tucked it into the corner of the sofa, then threw the pillow on top.

After doing all this, Raymond turned and smiled at Isabella. "Sorry, I was sleeping earlier and didn't have time to tidy up. Have a seat."

Isabella was speechless about his behaviour.

Meanwhile, at the grocery store a thousand feet away from Green Valley Community, Nina hung up the phone and bought two fish and some vegetables.

She was about to buy some strawberries.

But her mother-in-law Deborah grabbed her. "Why are you buying this?"

Deborah glanced at the price, her eyes nearly popping out. She said, " Nobody eats this where we come from, and here it's selling for $80 per pound. It's daylight robbery!"

Nina said, "Mom, strawberries are this price in this season. It's the same everywhere."

Saying that, she took a bag to pick strawberries.

Deborah pulled the bag open and said, "Even if you buy such expensive stuff, it won't give you superpowers. If you want fruit, I saw apples at the store entrance, $10 for 1.35 pounds, much more cost-effective than these strawberries."

Nina took another bag. "It's not for me."

"Is it for Charlie?" Deborah's expression softened a bit. "Then just buy a few to try. Don't buy too much. Making money isn't easy."

Nina wanted to say it wasn't for Charlie.

It was for Isabella.

Isabella loved strawberries.

Every year when strawberries were in season, Nina would secretly buy some.

This was her first time buying them this year.

But seeing Deborah's expression, Nina knew if she told the truth, Deborah would nag endlessly.

So Nina swallowed her words.

As Nina picked big red strawberries and put them in the bag, Deborah took out the large ones and replaced them with small, ugly ones.

In the end, it totaled $35.

Seeing the few strawberries in the bag, Deborah almost argued with the shop owner.

Nina had to pull her out.

All the way, Deborah kept complaining, saying if it weren't for Nina insisting on buying strawberries, she wouldn't have had to argue with the shop owner.Â 

Â And Deborah complained that Nina insisted on buying expensive stuff.

But Nina let her talk, not taking Deborah's words to heart.

At the doorstep, Deborah walked in without changing her shoes, still grumbling about Nina's various faults.

Sitting at the dining table, Isabella came face to face with Deborah.

Deborah finally stopped talking, her eyes scanning Isabella up and down. She said, "who is she?"

Nina changed her shoes and said to Isabella, "Bella, this is Charlie's mom."

Isabella stood up and said lightly, "Auntie."

"Oh my!" Deborah immediately grabbed her hand with a smile on her face,, her eyes gleaming. "My goodness, Nina, your sister looks nothing like you. She's much prettier!"

Deborah's hand was warm and she had an indescribable smell. She held Isabella's hand tightly, leaning in so close that Isabella felt uncomfortable all over.

Isabella pulled her hand back and walked to Nina.

Deborah wanted to step forward, but Nina stopped her. "Mom, have a seat. I'll take Bella to the kitchen to wash some fruit."

With that, Nina led Isabella into the kitchen and closed the glass door.

The sink quickly filled with water, Nina handed a clean strawberry to Isabella.

"The fruit here isn't great. So I bought a few for you to try. Next time, I'll get better ones."

Isabella took a bite of the strawberry. Althought it was sweet, she just couldn't bring herself to be happy.

"Nina, when did Charlie's mom and brother arrive?" she asked gloomily.

###chapter 130  They All Like to Flirt with Men

Nina paused and smiled, "They just arrived a few days ago. His mom heard I was pregnant, so she wanted to come see for herself."

"Are they just staying for a few days and then leaving?" Isabella asked.

"Probably," Nina replied. "They just got here, so it's not polite to ask right away. It feels like I'm rushing them out. Why do you ask?"

Isabella remained silent.

Her impression of Charlie was already bad, and her impression of Deborah was even worse.

Someone like Charlie, Isabella found it hard to believe his family could be any better.

Although Isabella wasn't married, she knew that the relationship between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law could be challenging. Especially since Deborah didn't seem like an easy person to get along with.

'One Charlie is enough.

'Now Deborah and Raymond have arrived as well,' Isabella thought.

She was really worried for Nina.

The two sisters chatted in the kitchen for a bit, and then Deborah pushed the door open and came in.

"Bella, why don't you stay for lunch today? Your sister bought some groceries. Leave the kitchen to us. Bella, you can go sit on the couch, watch TV, and chat with Raymond. Your sister and I'll take care of everything here."

As Deborah spoke, she gently pushed Isabella out of the kitchen.

Raymond was already dressed, wearing jeans and a black T-shirt. Although he was smiling, his eyes were always on Isabella.

He siad, "Isabella, what TV shows do you usually watch? I'll find one for you."

Isabella shook her head and kept her distance. "I don't usually watch TV."

"Then what do you usually like to do?"

"Reading," Isabella replied.

"That's great! I love reading too."

Isabella said nothing.

She had nothing to talk about with Raymond.

First, they weren't familiar with each other.

Second, Raymond was a man, and Isabella was a woman.

Isabella's gaze fell on the kitchen, where she watched Nina's occasional figure, her worry deepening.

In the kitchen, Deborah leaned against the counter with her hands in her pockets and asked, "Nina, how old is your sister?"

Nina paused and replied, "21."

A hint of joy flashed in Deborah's eyes. She said, "That's perfect."

"What's perfect?"

Deborah clicked her tongue in dissatisfaction at Nina's slowness and said, "Raymond is 24 this year, just three years older than Bella. Isn't that perfect?"

Nina wasn't stupid and she saw Deborah's intentions toward Isabella.

Since Deborah was her mother-in-law, and they were family after all, so Nina couldn't speak too harshly. She forced a smile and said, "Mom, you shouldn't think about that. Isabella and Raymond aren't suitable."

Deborah rolled her eyes behind Nina's back and said, "They can have a try."

With that, she walked to the kitchen door, pulled it open, and walked out.

Isabella looked over.

Deborah immediately put on a smiling face. "Bella, we're out of vinegar in the kitchen. Could you go downstairs and buy a bottle?"

Isabella was anxious to get some fresh air because she felt uncomfortable being alone with Raymond.

"Sure."

She stood up and went to the entryway to change her shoes.

As soon as Isabella stepped out, she noticed Raymond following her.

Isabella glanced at him.

Raymond smiled, "My mom asked me to go with you and protect you while I familiarize myself with the area."

Isabella frowned but said nothing.

They went downstairs together, bought a bottle of vinegar from the corner store, and headed back.

As they reached the corner, Raymond suddenly caught up from behind. "Isabella, let me carry that."

He reached out and grabbed Isabella's hand.

Isabella froze and turned to see Raymond's unrestrained smile.

It was a flirtatious smile, mixed with calculation and triumph.

Isabella knew he did it on purpose.

So she quickly pulled her hand back and walked ahead.

Raymond was still lost in the soft touch of her hand, surprised at how smooth it was. Just one grasp had made his heart race.

By the time he snapped out of it, Isabella was already at the entrance of the building.

His smile grew even more audacious as he jogged to catch up. "Isabella, wait for me."

Isabella didn't dare wait for Raymond.

She rushed into the hallway and repeatedly pressed the elevator button.

As soon as the elevator doors opened, she dashed in.

Unexpectedly, she ran into Sebastian's arms.

"Sorry..."

The word sorry stuck in her throat, then Isabella's expression froze.

She looked at Sebastian standing in front of her, feeling like she was dreaming.

"Mr. Landon?"

She felt too unreal.

She actually saw Sebastian in the elevator of Nina's apartment building.

The elevator doors closed and opened again.

Raymond walked in. "Isabella, why are you running so fast? And I'm not going to eat you."

Isabella snapped out of her daze and blinked hard. When she opened her eyes again, Sebastian was still there.

At this moment, he was looking down at her with indifferent black eyes.

"Isabella?" Raymond tugged at her.

When Raymond saw how cold she was to him, but how she was staring at Sebastian, Raymond felt displeased. "Isabella, you should understand my mom's intentions. She wants us to get closer. And she wants me to pursue you."

"If you don't mind, just say so. We can start dating right away."

Isabella didn't expect Raymond to be so direct. It was awkward in front of Sebastian.

"You're overthinking it," Isabella said.

Raymond seemed surprised. "Why? You don't like me?"

Raymond's question left Isabella unsure how to respond.

She didn't understand where Raymond got the confidence to think she would like him after just one meeting.

Raymond's gaze lingered on Isabella's face for a few seconds before shifting to Sebastian.

After sizing Sebastian up, Raymond's eyes grew tired.

Sebastian was indeed tall and handsome, something Raymond could never achieve.

This comparison made Raymond uncomfortable. He asked Isabella, "You like guys like him?"

Isabella was stunned.

Sebastian raised an eyebrow and glanced at Raymond dismissively, like royalty looking down on a commoner.

"No!" Isabella quickly clarified, afraid Sebastian might misunderstand.

Â SheÂ continued, "Raymond, my sister and your brother are married. That's the extent of our relationship. Please don't say things like that again."

Raymond, trying to save face, softened his tone. "Isabella, I know it's sudden since we just met. But I can't believe you don't have any feelings for me. Otherwise, why did you let me hold your hand earlier?"

As Raymond finished speaking, the temperature in the elevator seemed to drop several degrees.

Isabella felt a chill and looked up, meeting Sebastian's unfathomable gaze.

Raymond, feeling smug, said, "I know city women like to play hard to get, but I'm not falling for it. If you're willing, we can just start dating. There's no need for any pretense, and we canÂ just live a stable life like my brother and your sister. That's better than anything else!"

###chapter 131 The Biting Isabella

Raymond's words were something Isabella couldn't respond to.

So she didn't want to respond either.

She had already said everything that needed to be said. Saying more would be pointless.

The elevator quickly reached the floor. As the doors opened, Nina was standing outside.

"Bella." Nina pulled Isabella over, seeing Raymond and Sebastian inside.

Nina paused and said, "You ran into Mr. Landon. I was worried he wouldn't find you."

Isabella felt confused and said, "Mr. Landon was looking for me?"

"Yes, Mr. Landon just came to my house looking for you. I told him you went downstairs to buy vinegar."

After hearing Nina's explanation, Isabella looked at Sebastian.

'So his appearance here isn't a coincidence?

He specifically came to Nina's house to find me,' Isabella thought.

Raymond stood aside, his eyes darting between Isabella and Sebastian, with displeasure and jealousy written all over his face.

Seeing this, Nina thought it was a good opportunity and pushed Isabella forward, saying, "Well, Bella, since Mr. Landon has something to discuss with you, I won't keep you for dinner. Go ahead."

As she spoke, she pushed Isabella back into the elevator.

Raymond also wanted to follow, but Nina held him back. "Raymond, Mom needs the vinegar. Let's go back quickly."

With that, Nina didn't allow Raymond to refuse and dragged him away.

The elevator doors closed.

Isabella took a deep breath, still thinking about how to start the conversation.

Suddenly, her arm was grabbed tightly, and she was pulled straight over by Sebastian.

She looked up and met Sebastian's eyes. "Mr. Landon, you were looking for me?"

Sebastian lowered his gaze, his eyes clearly swirling with displeasure. "How many more of these?"

'What does he mean?' Isabella thought.

Isabella didn't understand Sebastian's words.

Sebastian's grip on her arm tightened even more.

Isabella gasped in pain, her shoulders tensing. She wispered, "It hurts."

The elevator reached the parking garage on the basement level. As the doors opened, Sebastian pulled Isabella out and headed straight for a black car parked there.

Sebastian opened the car door and threw Isabella inside.

Once he got in, he slammed the door and coldly ordered the driver, "Drive!"

As the car left Green Valley Community, Sebastian's grip on her hand did not loosen, but tightened even more.

Isabella's eyes reddened from the pain, but she didn't struggle. She looked at Sebastian's profile and asked, "Mr. Landon, where are you taking me?"

Sebastian just glanced at her without answering. His profile looked very stern and rigid. Moreover, he seemed to be more irritated.

It wasn't until the car entered the hotel parking lot that Isabella started to panic.

Adult men and women came to a hotel in broad daylight. And what could it be for?

"Mr. Landon." Isabella had just opened her mouth when Sebastian pulled her out.

Her heart tightened. As she was pulled out of the car, she grabbed the car door with her other hand.

"Mr. Landon, what exactly do you want from me?"

Sebastian turned his head and glanced at her hand holding the car door, saying,"What do you think?"

If she knew, she wouldn't be asking.

Sebastian continued, "Adult men and women usually go to hotels to have sex, Isabella. Do you really not understand?"

Isabella was stunned. "Mr. Landon, I thought I made it clear before. Please stop bothering me!"

Her words angered Sebastian.

He moved closer and pinned Isabella against the car.

His fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to look up at him.

Sebastian lowered his head, his lips almost brushing against hers. "Anyone else can, but why can't I , Isabella? Have I not given you enough, or do you think I'm too gentlemanly and not exciting enough?"

Sebastian glanced inside the car and smirked, "I get it. You don't want to go up and you want to do it in the car?"

Before Isabella could respond, Sebastian pushed the driver away and shoved her back into the back seat.

The car door closed again.

In the dim car, Isabella looked up to see Sebastian loosening his tie, a faint anger on his face.

His eyes were fixed on Isabella as if he wanted to devour her.

Sebastian moved closer, easily controlling Isabella.

He kissed her lips, holding her fingers, and they gently sank together.

It was unclear how much time had passed, and the atmosphere in the car became heated.

Suddenly, Isabella heard Vanessa's voice outside.

"Huh, is that Sebastian's car?"

Isabella's eyes snapped open.

At that moment, Isabella's clothes were half off and she was straddling Sebastian's lap, engaged in the act.

Isabella's toes curled in shame. Unable to push Sebastian away, she tightly hugged him, lying on his shoulder, panting weakly, "Mr. Landon, stop."

Sebastian seemed not to hear her plea, continuing undisturbed by the outside world.

There was a knock on the door.

Isabella turned her head and saw Vanessa standing outside.

Because the car windows were covered with one-way film, Vanessa couldn't see inside even if she pressed her face against the glass.

"Sebastian?" Vanessa called twice.

Receiving no response, she frowned and reached to pull the car door.

Isabella tensed up instinctively, which only excited Sebastian more.

He bit Isabella's ear and cursed, "Minx!"

His movements became even more aggressive.

Isabella couldn't take it but didn't dare to make a sound.

She was afraid Vanessa would hear.

Isabella could only bite her teeth tightly.

But Sebastian was relentless, and she couldn't hold back, so she bit his shoulder hard.

Sebastian let out a muffled groan because of pain.

But the corners of his mouth curled up in pleasure.

He liked Isabella who bit him.

Vanessa pulled on the car door a couple of times, but it didn't budge.

The car door was locked.

It confirmed that someone was indeed inside.

Vanessa stepped back a couple of steps, her eyes fixed on the car window.

Suddenly, Vanessa's gaze dropped to the car tires.

Her pupils contracted sharply, and she bit her lip hard.

Vanessa saw that the car was rocking slightly.

The car rocked so subtly that she hadn't noticed it before.

Now, stepping back, she saw the car shaking quite a bit.

What the people inside were doing was obvious.

Vanessa pulled out her phone and called Sebastian.

She held the phone to her ear, listening to the ringing inside the car, her eyes still fixed on the car window.

The call only rang for a few seconds before it was hung up.

Vanessa, not giving up, found Isabella's number and called.

A few seconds later, a phone rang inside the car.

Vanessa was devastated.

It really was Isabella.

The woman in Sebastian's car was Isabella.

Isabella's phone had fallen onto the car seat. And Sebastian picked it up, glanced at it, and then hung up.

He turned it off and threw it far away.

Isabella was speechless.

She wanted to turn her head to look at Vanessa outside the car, but Sebastian grabbed the back of her head and kissed her hard.

"Be focus." Sebastian slapped Isabella's leg, his voice deep.

A long time passed before Sebastian finally finished.

But he still held Isabella, sitting for a long time.

Outside the car, Vanessa was long gone.

Isabella clutched her clothes, the blush on her face lingering.

Sebastian lowered his head and kissed her. "I have a villa in the Cuihu District. Do you want to go there to clean up?"

Isabella looked up at him.

###chapter 132  The Creditor

Isabella stared at Sebastian for a long time.

Sebastian lowered his eyes and met her gaze.

His large hand threaded through Isabella's black hair, his fingers pressed against her scalp as he pulled her closer and said, "Do you want to make love again?"

Isabella put her hand on his shoulder. "Mr. Landon, how do you plan to explain that to Vanessa?"

"Explain?" Sebastian frowned and said, "I don't plan to explain."

"Then what are we?"

Sebastian looked at her and said, "Whatever you want us to be."

His hand supported Isabella's waist, pulling her closer. He said,"Isabella, I don't care how many men you've had before. From this moment on, you're mine!"

Sebastian's tone was domineering and left no room for refusal.

Isabella bit her lip and said, "I don't want to!"

"Whether you want to or not, you have to." Sebastian said, "Isabella, I have a thousand ways to make you want to."

Isabella looked at him in shock, her eyelashes trembling slightly.

It was true.

Sebastian had that power and ability.

She was just an ordinary person without the right to resist.

The driver drove the car to the villa in Cuihu District.

Upon arrival, Sebastian carried Isabella out of the car.

The villa, named Oceancloud Manor, was unoccupied, but it seemed that a housekeeping company came to clean regularly, so the house was very clean, and the furniture was brand new.

Sebastian carried her all the way upstairs, placed her in the bathtub, and reached out to undress her.

Isabella covered her neckline and said, "I'll do it myself."

Sebastian looked at her for a few seconds, but didn't insist. So he let go and walked out of the bathroom.

Isabella enjoyed a comfortable bath, but her mind was still in turmoil.

The development of her relationship with Sebastian was far beyond her expectations.

Now, she didn't know what to do.

When Isabella finished bathing, she realized her original clothes were all wet.

Even if they weren't wet, they were dirty from her earlier encounter with Sebastian in the car and couldn't be worn again.

There was a large cabinet in the bathroom. When Isabella opened it, there were not only bathrobes but also several sets of women's pajamas.

There were silk ones and cotton ones.

They were all brand new.

These clothes seemed to have been washed once, emitting a faint fragrance.

Isabella knew these were prepared by Sebastian in advance.

She chose a set of cotton pajamas, put them on, and then opened the door to go out.

"All done?" Sebastian walked over, pulled her into his arms, and gently held her.

He lowered his head and greedily sniffed her scent, saying, "Smells good."

Isabella's cheeks flushed. She slightly pushed him away and said, "Where's the laundry room? My clothes need washing."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow and led her to the walk-in closet.

He turned on the light, and a room full of women's clothing came into view.

Isabella looked at it all in surprise, saying, "Have you hidden women here before?"

Sebastian chuckled, "You're the first."

He led her inside and personally picked out a pure white dress for her, saying,"Do you want me to help you change?"

Isabella took the dress and said, "No need!"

"Then I'll wait outside." Sebastian leaned in, kissed her forehead, and then walked out of the closet, thoughtfully closing the door behind him.

There was a large full-length mirror in the closet.

Isabella turned and looked at herself in the mirror, feeling like everything was a dream.

There was no serventÂ at Oceancloud Manor, so Sebastian called someone to deliver some food.

After eating, Isabella said, "Can I leave now?"

Sebastian glanced at her and took out some items.

"This is my secondary card. Take it and buy whatever you want."

"This is the spare key to the villa. Keep it."

"The villa's password is 109124. Remember it?"

"These are the cars in the garage. You can drive any of them. But they are mostly men's models. If you don't like them, I'll buy you a new one."

Isabella looked at everything and thought,

'This is the extravagance of the wealthy.

'Spending money is like nothing.'

Sebastian continued, "If there is anything else I didn't think of, you can ask me for it."

Isabella said, "What if I say I don't want any of this?"

Sebastian's eyes darkened. "I've already paid off the eighty thousand dollars you owed to the Landon family. Isabella, I'm your creditor now."

'His movement is so fast,' Isabella thought.

"And the child in your belly," Sebastian frowned and said, "I've already asked Leo. And he said the child isn't his."

Isabella was shocked.

"Isabella, I don't care whose child it is, or how many men you've had before. From this moment on, you have to stay away from all men. If you want to have this child, have it, but the father can only be me!" Sebastian's tone was firm. "Understand?"

Isabella was speechless.

He made it so clear. Of course, she understood.

"And tomorrow, go back to work at the Landon Group."

Isabella was even more surprised and said, "But I've already resigned from the Landon Group."

Sebastian looked at her and smirked, "You didn't think you could pay off eighty thousand dollars just by having sex, did you?"

Isabella was speechless.

That's true.

That was eighty thousand dollars.

Sebastian lowered his eyes and thought,' In his heart, he just wants to keep me by his side. As long as I am under his watch, no other man could touch me.'

In the quiet moment, Sebastian's phone rang.

The call was from Zaire. He asked, "Is Isabella with you?"

"Yes."

Zaire laughed. "I knew you two are together. Come to my house for dinner. My mom said so."

After hanging up, Sebastian repeated Zaire's words and added, "The paternity test results are probably out."

Isabella nodded. "Should we go now?"

"What's the rush?" Sebastian reached out, pulling her into his arms and saying, "It's still early. Let's take a nap first."

Isabella was indeed a bit tired, partly because of the pregnancy and partly because of Sebastian.

She had been drowsy when she was taking a bath earlier.

Besides, Sebastian was her creditor now. Whatever he said, she had to comply.

She couldn't refuse him.

But Isabella had oversimplified the matter.

Sebastian's idea of a nap wasn't just sleeping.

Isabella had just laid down when he pulled her over for another round of lovemaking.

Isabella was exhausted from all the activity, while Sebastian, on the other hand, was full of energy

Fortunately, Sebastian didn't go on for too long.

After getting tired, they fell asleep holding each other.

What Isabella didn't know was that if it weren't for her pregnancy, Sebastian wouldn't have ended it so easily.

His energy for tormenting her could have easily doubled.

When Isabella woke up, Sebastian was already awake.

Although he didn't torment her anymore, his hands hadn't been idle.

As soon as she opened her eyes, Sebastian kissed her.

After a long while, Sebastian finally let her go and took her to the bathroom for a shower.

After all this, Isabella's legs were weak.

Sebastian was like a tireless robot, carrying her in and out, and personally dressing her in a cream knit dress, paired with a camel coat, a matching bag, and scarf. Before they left, he also gave her a beret.

He also opened the shoe cabinet and picked out a pair of flat ankle boots for her.

Before leaving, Isabella looked at herself in the mirror.

With Sebastian's styling, Isabella felt like a whole new person.

###chapter 133 Just Once

In the mirror, Sebastian's figure suddenly appeared.

He stood slightly behind Isabella, wrapping one arm around her waist from behind.

He lowered his head, planted a kiss on the top of Isabella's head, and praised her bluntly, "You look great!"

Even though they had been at it all day, Sebastian's compliment still made Isabella blush.

By the time they arrived at the Jose family, it was already dark.

Zaire heard the sound of the car, came out to greet them, and saw the two walking in hand in hand.

His gaze lingered on their intertwined fingers for a moment, raising his eyebrows as if he understood everything.

Isabella panicked and tried to pull her hand back.

But Sebastian seemed to have anticipated her thoughts and held her hand tightly, not giving her a chance to escape.

Zaire glanced at Sebastian. He knew Isabella was shy, so he didn't tease them directly and said with a smile, "We've been waiting for you for a while. Come on in!"

As Zaire turned around, Sebastian spoke up, "Yes, that's right. We're together now!"

Zaire was stunned that he hadn't even asked Sebastian about that.

'He's really bold!' Isabella thought.

Isabella even had the illusion that Sebastian couldn't wait to grab a megaphone and announce their relationship to the world.

Zaire held back his laughter, saying, "Congratulations, wishing you both happiness!"

Isabella blushed.

Sebastian, however, smiled happily. "Thanks for the blessing."

Isabella wanted to find a hole to crawl into.

In the living room of the Jose family, everyone else was there.

There was a sealed envelope in front of Margaret and Steven.

Inside the envelope was the blood test result between them and Isabella.

For the past three days, Margaret had been both hopeful and fearful.

'If Isabella is indeed my daughter, it would be a great thing.

'But what if she isn't?' Margaret thought.

Steven sensed Margaret's emotions and silently held her hand.

The couple exchanged a glance, and Margaret said, "Let Zaire open it."

"Alright." Steven agreed to everything she said.

Zaire looked around and said, "Then I'll open it."

He reached for the envelope and carefully untied the string.

He then took out the report and glanced at it.

After just a couple of looks, Zaire frowned.

"How is it?" Steven asked.

Kelsey couldn't hold back, threw away the pillow, ran over to grab the report, and read out the result word by word. "According to the test, there is no blood relationship between the two parties!"

"So that means Isabella really isn't my sister?" Kelsey was still a bit disappointed.

Steven let out a sigh.

Margaret covered her mouth, tears falling silently.

Isabella wasn't surprised by the result. Because she never thought she would be the Jose family's daughter.

The ages didn't match up.

The real Lisa was several years older than her.

But seeing Margaret so sad, she still felt quite bad.

"What a pity, I really get along well with Isabella," Kelsey pouted.

Her words made Margaret feel even worse.

"Actually, If Isabella is willing, Mom and Dad can adopt her as a goddaughter."

Â Zaire looked at Isabella and said, "Isabella, would you be willing?"

Before Isabella could speak, Kelsey said, "Yes, that's great! Well, when we find my sister, I'll have two sisters, and Mom and Dad will have another daughter. I fully support this!"

Steven and Margaret both liked Isabella a lot. During the three days waiting for the test results, they had fantasized about Isabella being their long-lost daughter.

Now faced with reality, if they could adopt Isabella as a goddaughter, it would be a fulfilling thing.

Steven and Margaret exchanged a glance, increasingly feeling that this was a good idea.

So, they both looked at Isabella.

Isabella said, "Isn't this a bit sudden?"

She wasn't mentally prepared for this.

Besides, for such a big decision, she had to discuss it with Nina and get her approval before responding to the Jose family.

Margaret said, "You're right. It's not a small matter. How about letting your sister's family come over for dinner this weekend at the Jose family. So we can talk in person."

Isabella nodded and agreed.

After dinner, Kelsey pulled Isabella back to her room.

As soon as the door closed, Kelsey eagerly asked, "Are you and Sebastian together?"

Isabella was a bit shy but she didn't deny it.

After all, Sebastian had shown his care for her in front of the Jose family the whole time.

She nodded and responded, "Yes."

Kelsey seemed a bit excited. "How far have you two gone?"

She didn't know how to answer that.

After thinking for a moment, Isabella said, "It's not what you think. He helped me pay off eighty thousand dollars, and now we have a debt relationship."

Kelsey raised an eyebrow. "Isabella, Sebastian is serious about you."

"He's serious about me, but what about Vanessa?"

"Vanessa? She doesn't matter!" Kelsey waved her hand and continued, "I swear that there's nothing real between Sebastian and Vanessa!"

Isabella was silent for a moment and said, "But Vanessa called me the other day and said she's pregnant."

"Impossible!" Kelsey widened her eyes. "Does Sebastian know about this?"

"He should know, right?"

Isabella wasn't sure.

But with such big news, Vanessa had no reason not to tell Sebastian.

Kelsey picked up her phone and dialed Sebastian even though Sebastian was currently in her house, in Zaire's study.

The call was quickly answered.

Kelsey immediately asked, "Sebastian, do you know that Vanessa is pregnant?"

Isabella watched from the side, impressed by Kelsey's straightforwardness.

She didn't even have time to stop her before Kelsey blurted it out.

'How Impressive Kelsey is!' Isabella thought.

There was a two-second silence on the other end before Sebastian's voice came through. "What did you say?"

Kelsey said, "You didn't know? Isabella told me that Vanessa used to call her and tell her that. How could you not know about something important like that?"

After the call ended, Zaire laughed, "So you're going to be a stepdad to Isabella's child. What about Vanessa's child?"

Sebastian frowned. "Vanessa is pregnant?"

"That's what I'm asking you." Zaire smirked, "Don't you know what you've done?"

Sebastian gave him a deep look and said, "I only slept with her once."

That was four months ago during that camping trip.

It was that accident that led to his current relationship with Vanessa.

Zaire said, "Vanessa seems complicated. She didn't even tell you about something as big as being pregnant. You should definitely look into it."

On the other side, after Kelsey hung up the phone, she didn't speak for a long time.

Isabella was also lost in thought.

After a while, Kelsey said, "I see!"

Isabella looked at her and said, "What?"

"Vanessa is lying!"

###chapter 134  He's Not the Only Option

"Vanessa is such a flamboyant person. She would prefer to make the whole world Â know about her relationship with Sebastian. If she was really pregnant, how could she not post a status about it? And how could she not tell Sebastian? If she really had a child, she would have announced it to the world by now, right?"

Kelsey's analysis undeniably made some sense.

But Isabella felt that Vanessa wouldn't go that far.

In Isabella's opinion, Vanessa was Sebastian's fiancÃ©e and had been with him for over a year. Since Sebastian had a strong sexual appetite,Â they were likely intimate quite often.

It wouldn't be too hard for her to get pregnant.

"Anyway, I think there's something fishy about this. Sebastian should look into it!"

Kelsey who was impatient, was about to call Sebastian again as she spoke.

This time, Isabella quickly stopped her. "Don't do that."

Kelsey was puzzled and said,"Isabella, don't you want to know if Vanessa is really pregnant?"

Isabella shook her head and said, "I don't want to."

"Why not?"

Isabella paused for a moment and then said, "Between Mr. Landon and me, it's purely a debt relationship. I don't want to get too involved with him and Vanessa. Whether Vanessa is pregnant or not has nothing to do with me."

"Aren't you afraid that if she is pregnant, Sebastian will leave you?"

Isabella froze.

She asked herself this question in her heart.

Then Isabella shook her head, her eyes showing determination. "No. There are so many men in this world. He's not the only option."

Kelsey was slightly surprised and then gave Isabella a thumbs-up.

Outside the door, Sebastian stood quietly.

He had heard everything Isabella had just said, and his long eyebrows gradually furrowed.

On the way back, Sebastian had a sullen face, a cold aura surrounding him.

Isabella guessed that Sebastian was probably worried about Vanessa being pregnant.

She thought, 'After all, the child in Vanessa's belly is his legitimate child.'

Isabella touched her own belly.

'The child in myr belly is also Sebastian's.

'But this child is destined to be hidden in the shadows like that night,' Isabella thought.

The car drove all the way back to Oceancloud Manor.

Once inside, Sebastian pulled Isabella onto the couch, pressing down on her and kissing her fiercely.

His kiss was different from the gentle and delicate ones during the day. But it was now filled with a kind of intensity that made Isabella almost unable to breathe.

When she was about to suffocate, Sebastian finally let her go.

Just as she caught her breath, he covered her again, sealing her lips.

They moved from the living room to the bedroom.

Half awake, Sebastian held Isabella in his arms, biting her ear and saying fiercely, "Isabella, Â I'll make sure you can't live without me in the future!"

The next morning, when Isabella opened her eyes, she found herself alone in the room.

The whole villa was very quiet.

The doorbell rang.

Isabella went to open the door and found Jack standing outside.

Jack was momentarily surprised to see her, then quickly understood and handed her a bag. "Mr. Landon asked me to bring you breakfast."

He then handed her a set of car keys. "After eating the breakfast, Mr.Landon wants you to drive to the company."

Isabella looked at the new white car parked in the yard.

It was a small, brand-new model, without a license plate, just a temporary tag on the window.

In Isabella's memory, Sebastian's cars were all black, but this white one was quite unique.

"This car?"

Jack responded, "Mr. Landon just bought it. The license plate is still being processed."

Isabella was speechless.

She remembered that Sebastian had said yesterday that if she didn't like any of the cars in his garage, he would buy her a new one.

She hadn't said she didn't like them, yet he had already bought her a new car.

While having breakfast, Isabella checked online and found out that the car was a new model released just last month.

Though small, it was ridiculously expensive.

Isabella counted and found it costed one hundred thousand dollars.

It was such an expensive car. Isabella didn't dare to drive it.

After breakfast, she took a car to the Landon Group.

When Laura and the others saw her, their eyes widened in surprise.

Only Kelsey warmly linked arms with her.

Isabella's old desk was still in Sebastian's office, unchanged from when she left.

Sebastian was not in the office at this moment, and no one assigned her any tasks.

Feeling bored, Isabella casually flipped through the documents on her desk.

Suddenly, the office door was pushed open.

Isabella looked up and saw Vanessa walking in.

She pausedÂ and stood up.

Vanessa walked straight over and, without saying a word, slapped Isabella hard.

Isabella couldn't dodge in time and was hit squarely, losing her balance and falling into the chair.

"Isabella, have you forgotten what you promised me before?" Vanessa glared coldly at Isabella, her eyes almost spitting fire.Â 

And she continued,"I showed you respect, but you chose to be shameless. Don't blame me for this!"

After saying that, Vanessa walked to the office door, opened it, and started shouting.

"Isabella, you schemed to get into Mr. Landon's bed. Now that you've succeeded, are you proud of yourself?"

"I pitied you before and forgave you once. Why can't you respect yourself and stop trying to ruin my relationship with Mr. Landon?"

"Don't you feel ashamed being a mistress?"

Vanessa's shouting echoed throughout the office.

Isabella sat in her chair, staring blankly at the scene, completely unresponsive.

Isabella wanted to say something, but when she opened her mouth, she found she had nothing to say.

'Vanessa is Sebastian's fiancÃ©e.

'No matter how others look at it, I am indeed the mistress ruining their relationship.

'A mistress doesnot deserve respect.

'If I were a bystander, I would also despise someone like me!' Isabella thought.

"Mr. Landon!" Laura's voice interrupted VanessaÂ in time.

Everyone turned and saw Sebastian stepping out of the elevator.

He walked quickly, his face dark. It seemed that he rushed back from the meeting after hearing about the incident in the office .

His gaze swept across the office, and all the gossipers backed off.

"Sebastian." Vanessa wiped away her tears and reached out to grab his arm.

Sebastian avoided her expressionlessly and walked into the office.

Isabella was still sitting there, half of her face swollen, but her eyes remained clear.

Sebastian's heart tightened. He strode over to her and said, "She hit you, and you didn't know to dodge?"

His tone was more pained than reproachful.

Isabella said nothing.

From her perspective, she was indeed in the wrong.

She had done something that couldn't be exposed to light.

Of course, Sebastian had forced her into this too.

"Jack, call Marvin over!" Sebastian looked at her but was giving orders to Jack outside.

"Yes, Mr. Landon," Jack responded and went to make the call.

Vanessa stood at the door, her eyes filled with tears as she looked at Sebastian's back. She said, "Sebastian, you can't treat me like this. I am your fiancÃ©e. You promised to take responsibility for me. You can't go back on your word!"

Sebastian turned, his cold, deep gaze falling on Vanessa's face. He said, "I heard you're pregnant?"

Vanessa was stunned.

###chapter 135  Would You Like To Do It?

Vanessa's eyes flashed with a hint of guilt.

Her tricks might fool Isabella, but they were useless in front of Sebastian.

"Yes, I'm not pregnant!" Vanessa had to admit the truth, and she felt even more regretful.

Â Vanessa thought that if she had been more careful and cautious during her pregnancy preparation period and had not gone to the bar to drink, she might have successfully conceived by now. Then she would have the right to kick Isabella out.

Unfortunately, she failed.

Isabella's eyelashes fluttered slightly, and she was quite surprised to hear this.

She didn't expect Kelsey to be right and Vanessa really wasn't pregnant.

"That's right, I deliberately lied to Isabella, but I did it because you forced me. If you hadn't neglected me during this time, would I have needed to lie?" Vanessa sat on the ground, crying uncontrollably.

"Vanessa." Laura walked over and said, "Mr. Landon, I can't stand it anymore. We all know Vanessa is your fiancÃ©e. Is this really fair for you to treat her like this?"

Sebastian glanced coldly at Vanessa and said, " You didn't tell them?"

When she met his gaze, Vanessa's eyes flickered. "Mr. Landon, so you're breaking up with me for Isabella?"

Sebastian had not returned all night.

Early this morning, he rushed back, closed the study door, and told Vanessa about the breakup.

Sebastian gave Vanessa some money as compensation for the camping night, making a clear break with her.

But she was unwilling to accept it.

She had planned to use the medicine tonight to secure Sebastian once and for all.

But plans couldn't keep up with changes. Just as she left the pharmacy, she received a call from Laura saying Isabella had returned to the Landon Group.

That was why Vanessa hurried over.

In fact, Sebastian had already broken up with her.

But Vanessa couldn't swallow this.

Vanessa thought all of this should have been hers..

Despite all her precautions, she still couldn't guard against Isabella.

Sebastian frowned, very disgusted by Vanessa's behavior. He said, "I'm breaking up with you not for anyone else. Even without Isabella, I would still break up with you today."

"You're lying!" Vanessa cried, "If it weren't for Isabella, how could you neglect me? Sebastian, you said you would take responsibility for me!"

"I take responsibility for you, but who takes responsibility for Isabella?"

Vanessa was stunned, tears still on her face. She said,"What do you mean?"

"On that night for gathering, do you really have no idea what you did?"

Vanessa was dumbfounded.

She didn't know Sebastian already knew about that night.

'It must have been Isabella who told him!' Vanessa thought.

"You know?" Vanessa hurriedly tried to explain, "But that night was an accident. I was also a victim."

"Really?" Sebastian sneered, "Then how do you explain the IVF treatment?"

Vanessa was completely stunned.

'Sebastian even knew about my secret IVF treatment!'

"IVF?" Laura seemed to recall something. "No wonder Samantha said she saw you at the hospital and mentioned you had a secret. So it was IVF?"

Vanessa bit her teeth hard. She knew she shouldn't have trusted Samantha.

Sebastian said, "That night, the person with me was Isabella, but the next day you claimed it was you. I clearly remember there were some condoms on the bedside table that night, but the next day there was nothing in the trash can. Vanessa, did you really think I was too sick to see through your lies?"

As his words fell, the office fell into silence.

Laura looked at Vanessa. Although she didn't know the specifics, Sebastian's words made it easy to piece together the general situation.

Moreover, she also remembered that night when Vanessa spilled soup on Isabella and took her away to clean up. But soon, she only saw Vanessa coming downstairs alone. At that time, she asked, and Vanessa said Isabella had left. Laura didn't think much of it back then, but now it seemed Vanessa's words didn't hold up.

So Vanessa had deliberately set it up, sending Isabella to Sebastian's bed, preparing condoms, and later completing the artificial insemination plan.

If this was true, Vanessa's current predicament wasn't pitiable but rather detestable.

Seeing this, Vanessa shook her head vehemently and said, "It's not like that. I didn't do it."

"Mr. Landon, Dr. Finn is here." Jack stood at the door, with Sebastian's private doctor Marvin behind him.

"Let him in," Sebastian said.

Marvin walked in with a medical kit, and Sebastian asked him to treat Isabella's swollen cheek.

Then Sebastian looked at Jack at the door. "Tell us what you found."

Marvin took out an ointment from the medical kit, applied it to his fingers. When he was about to apply it to Isabella's face,Â he suddenly felt a chill on the back of his neck.

He turned and saw Sebastian standing beside him, glaring at the ointment on his fingers.

Marvin knew Sebastian's temperament well. Since he sensed danger, he didn't dare to move.

Sebastian asked, "Will it be better if she applies this?"

"Her injury is superficial and not too serious."

In short, Isabella had just been slapped.

Vanessa hit hard and Isabella's skin was tender, so Isabella's cheek swelled quickly. But with a cold compress and some ointment, Isabella would soon be fine.

Marvin knew Sebastian was worried about Isabella, but it seemed a bit absurd to call him for that.

Seeing Sebastian watching, Marvin quickly handed over the ointment. "Would you like to do it?"

The ointment transferred from Marvin's fingers to Sebastian's. Sebastian stood beside Isabella, bent down, and gently applied the ointment to her cheek, spreading it with his fingers.

Marvin, with an understanding of the situation, retreated to a safe distance.

At the door, Vanessa and Laura watched with different expressions.

Jack found the photos on his phone and coldly stated, "Ms. Field, these are your medical records and surgery records from the hospital. Also, there Â are also receipts for the medicine and condoms you bought. After investigation, Vanessa mixed aphrodisiac in Mr. Landon's cold medicine that night, then sent Isabella to Mr. Landon's bedroom, falsely claiming Isabella had left. The collective food poisoning incident among colleagues that night was also traced back to the medicine she bought."

"What?" Laura was shocked and somewhat disbelieved, saying, "Wasn't the food poisoning Isabella's sister's doing?"

"I didn't!" Vanessa vehemently denied, "Mr. Landon, even if you want to exonerate Isabella, you can't blame everything on me. The food poisoning was because of Nina's dirty cooking and it had nothing to do with me!"

Jack nodded and said, "I reported this to the police ten minutes ago. I'm sure the police will find the truth."

Vanessa's eyes flashed with guilt, but she said nothing.

At this moment, the elevator door opened, and the company security led two police officers over.

"Who is Vanessa?"

Vanessa sat on the ground with a pale face, biting her lip hard. As if Â she didn't admit it, she could avoid this disaster.

###chapter 136 What About the Child

But it wouldn't change anything whether Vanessa spoke up or not.

In the end, the officers still took Vanessa away.

At the company entrance, as Vanessa was about to get into the police car, Laura and a few other girls who were usually close to her chased after them.

"Vanessa, was it really you who poisoned us that time when we got food poisoning?"

"We've been colleagues and got along well. How could you harm us over your personal issues?"

"We always thought you were a good person, but it turns out you were just pretending!"

"Vanessa, we're really disappointed at you!"

Everyone started accusing her, still furious about what had happened.

After all, who would have thought that someone as nice as Vanessa would secretly poison their food?

Vanessa glanced at them indifferently and said, "Bunch of idiots!"

"You!"

"All you do is suck up to people. How many of you have ever genuinely wished me well? Now that I'm in trouble, you come to kick me when I'm down. Is this what you call friendship? You just haven't been in my shoes. If you were, who among you would be any better than me?" Knowing that things were already settled, Vanessa didn't even bother to pretend anymore and revealed her true colors.

"Vanessa, you're really too outrageous!" Laura said angrily.

If the officers hadn't been there, she would have wanted to slap Vanessa.

Vanessa remained unmoved, just looking at her with a cold smile. "Laura, stop pretending. Ever since I got together with Mr. Landon, you've been jealous of me. Now that you see me like this, you must be really happy inside, right?"

"I have been jealous of you, but I always tried to help you and Mr. Landon."

Vanessa turned her head away and coldly interrupted, "It would be the same even without your help."

Laura gritted her teeth and said, "Vanessa, if you really poisoned us, we will definitely pursue this to the end!"

Vanessa smiled indifferently, as if she didn't care about them at all.

Isabella never thought things would turn out this way.

After Vanessa was taken away, Sebastian asked Marvin and Jack to leave as well and closed the office door.

Sebastian applied ointment to her swollen cheek and said, "Next time if someone hits you, you can hit them back!"

ã€€ã€€Isabella looked up at him.

Sebastian's handsome face was close, his dark eyes filled with concern. Isabella could even see her reflection in his eyes clearly.

ã€€ã€€"Did you hear me?" Sebastian gently brushed the hair from her forehead, his tone softening unconsciously. "With me backing you up, don't be afraid of anything."

"When did you and Vanessa break up?" She asked the question she most wanted to know.

"This morning."

Sebastian paused and then said, "It was just a matter of time. Vanessa and I weren't right for each other. Breaking up was inevitable. Even without you, it would have happened."

Isabella was just a catalyst that made Sebastian realize his true feelings sooner.

Being with Isabella gave Sebastian a feeling that he never had with Vanessa.

If it weren't for that unexpected night during the camping trip, he wouldn't have let Vanessa move into his house, and things wouldn't have developed to this point.

Isabella bit her lip and said, "If you weren't right for each other, why did you get together in the first place?"

Sebastian was silent for a moment and said, "It was an accident."

But he didn't elaborate it.

He reached out and patted Isabella's head, saying, "I have to attend a meeting. I'll come back early in the afternoon to take you home, change clothes, and visit Grandma."

Sebastian got up to leave, but Isabella grabbed his hand.

"Then what should I do now? Aren't you going to give me some tasks?"

Sebastian smiled indulgently and said, "Do whatever you want. If you have nothing to do, go to the inner room and take a nap."

After saying that, Sebastian bent down slightly and kissed her forehead.

Then he left.

Isabella was speechless, because Sebastian was treating her like a pet.

Sebastian kept his promise. He finished his work early in the afternoon and took Isabella back to Cuihu District.

They had planned to take a shower, change clothes, and then visit Zoe.

But before they could shower, Sebastian kept Isabella busy for over two hours.

Isabella had experienced Sebastian's stamina in this regard.

But he seemed tireless every time, with endless endurance.

Finally, Isabella was exhausted, Sebastian carried her into the bathroom.

After putting Isabella in the bathtub, he felt like doing it again.

Isabella was so scared that she kicked him out.

Sebastian looked at her terrified face and just smiled. He kissed her twice, and then left the bathroom.

After all this, it was nearly dark by the time they drove back home.

The lights in the villa were on, but it was very quiet.

Zoe was sitting alone at the dining table, looking very displeased.

When she heard someone come in, she didn't even turn around. She just snorted and turned her head away, not looking at the two people who entered.

"Grandma." Sebastian was the first to call out.

Zoe snorted and said, "How rare is it for you to come back? Glad you still remember me, huh?"

Sebastian smiled helplessly and said, "Come on. See who I brought home for you."

"No. It's just another woman after Vanessa. I'm not interested."

It seemed Zoe was really angry.

Sebastian chuckled and gently pushed Isabella's waist.

Isabella took two steps forward and called out, "Zoe."

Zoe was quiet for a couple of seconds and then suddenly turned around. When she saw Isabella, her cold face instantly melted into a smile. She said, "It's Bella?"

Zoe pulled Isabella's hand and glared at Sebastian, scolding, "You should have told me you were bringing Bella. I was angry for so long!"

"Wasn't I trying to surprise you?" Sebastian pulled out a chair for Isabella to sit down.

Zoe genuinely liked Isabella.

But when Zoe heard that Isabella and Sebastian were officially dating, she was a bit stunned.

Isabella saw a hint of hesitation in Zoe's eyes.

"What's wrong, Grandma?" Sebastian also noticed that Zoe didn't seem as happy as expected.Â 

He cotinued,"Didn't you always talk about Isabella? Now I've brought her back to be your granddaughter-in-law, and you're not happy?"

"I'm happy actually." Zoe said twice.

But both Isabella and Sebastian could tell she seemed to have something on her mind.

After dinner.

Zoe invited Isabella to her bedroom for a chat.

Sebastian wanted to follow, but Zoe shooed him away.

Isabella knew Zoe probably had something to say to her alone.

Once in the bedroom, they sat down, and Zoe held Isabella's hand, looking at her for a moment before speaking with a smile. "I never thought Â you would be the best match for Sebastian in the end."

"The first timeÂ when I saw you at the hospital, I thought if you could be with Sebastian, you might warm his heart. Now that it's come true, I should be happy. But..."

With Zoe's "but", Isabella's heart tightened, and she looked at Zoe.

Zoe asked, "Bella, what about your child?"

###chapter 137  Going Crazy in the Middle of the Night

"Although I'm not an old-fashioned person, I cannot accept my grandson marrying a woman who is carrying another man's child."

"Bella, I just want to ask you one question. Are you ready to spend your life with Sebastian, or are you planning to terminate this pregnancy?"

Zoe looked at Isabella intently, waiting for her answer.

Isabella was silent for a moment.

She pondered about whether she was ready to spend her life with Sebastian.

To be honest, Isabella hadn't made any preparations.

Or rather, everything happened so suddenly that Isabella didn't even have the chance to prepare before being dragged into this complicated relationship with Sebastian.

What kind of feelings did she have for Sebastian?

Perhaps even Isabella herself didn't have an answer.

If Isabella had to find an answer, it would be that Sebastian was the father of her child!

Seeing Isabella remain silent for a long time, Zoe sighed and said, "I can see that Sebastian really loves you. But Bella, your feelings are still very unclear. Can you tell me, do you actually like Sebastian?"

Isabella swallowed with difficulty and said, "I don't know."

Zoe nodded, as if this answer was Â expected. She said, "Today, Emma called me and said that Sebastian helped you pay off eighty thousand dollars. You agreed to be with Sebastian because of that?"

Isabella thought for a moment and nodded.

'Maybe, yes,' she thought.

The child was a necessary condition for her to accept Sebastian, and the eighty thousand dollars was another condition.

With these two conditions combined, she seemed to have no reason to refuse Sebastian.

Zoe gripped her hand tightly and said, "Bella, Sebastian is someone who values relationships deeply. If you've decided to spend your life with him, then be with him wholeheartedly. If you don't have that resolve, I hope you won't hurt him."

Isabella's eyelashes trembled.

She had never thought of hurting Sebastian.

In her life, she had always been the one getting hurt.

When she came out of Zoe's room, she found that Sebastian was waiting outside.

"What did Grandma say to you?" He walked over and held Isabella's hand.

Isabella shook her head and said,"Nothing much, just some family talk."

In the middle of the night, Isabella was awakened by the ringing of a phone.

She answered the call, "Hello."

A frantic voice came from the other end, "Bella, Matthew is missing!"

Isabella's sleepiness vanished. Before she could respond, the doorbell downstairs rang.

Sebastian took the phone, connected to the door camera, and the screen showed the front door. Isabella saw Matthew's figure in the footage.

She told the person on the phone, "Aunt Emma, don't worry. I see him."

Emma was sobbing and couldn't stop crying, "Did he come to you? Where is he? We'll come over right away."

Isabella glanced at Sebastian, "At Sebastian's house."

"Okay, okay, we'll come pick him up right away. Bella, please take care of him for a momet."

"Alright."

After hanging up the phone, Isabella got up.

Sebastian was quicker, draping a coat over her shoulder, taking her hand and going downstairs together.

When they opened the door, Matthew was standing in the wind. He was very dirty, as if he had just come from the studio, covered in paint, even on his face and hair. He was holding an empty picture frame in his hand.

When he saw Isabella, he dropped the frame with a clatter and hugged her tightly.

Sebastian frowned deeply, closed the door, and stood still, quietly watching Matthew and Isabella embrace.

Matthew seemed oblivious to Sebastian, holding Isabella tighter and tighter.

Isabella was almost suffocating, her face turning red, "Matthew, let go."

But Matthew just shook his head.

Suddenly, Isabella felt something wet on her neck and she realized that Matthew was crying like a child while holding her.

Before Isabella could react, she felt a weight lifted off her.

Sebastian grabbed Matthew by the collar and pulled him away from Isabella.

Sebastian tossed Matthew aside like trash and looked at him with disdain, saying, "It's been late at night. What are you doing?"

Matthew ignored Sebastian and reached out to hold Isabella's hand.

But Sebastian reacted quickly, shielding Isabella behind him. In a stern voice, he said, "Don't move!"

Matthew was stunned by Sebastian's fierceness and looked at him.

The two men locked eyes on each other, and an invisible tension filled the air.

When Emma and Charles rushed over, Matthew had calmed down but remained silent, his eyes never leaving Isabella and Sebastian's intertwined hands.

Half an hour.

Sebastian held Isabella's hand for half an hour, making her entire hand go numb.

She wanted to pull her hand back to move it, but whenever she tried, Sebastian would grip it tighter.

At the same time, Sebastian would turn and give her a dissatisfied look.

So Isabella felt speechless.

"Matthew!" Emma rushed into the living room and hugged Matthew tightly, crying, "Why did you come here? You scared me to death!"

Matthew pressed his lips together, not saying a word, his expression unchanged.

Charles followed his gaze to Isabella and Sebastian. When he saw their tightly clasped hands, he frowned.

"Matthew, go back with me, okay?" Emma pleaded.

But Matthew remained unmoved, his eyes fixed on Isabella.

Everyone present understood his meaning.

Emma, teary-eyed and at a loss, turned to Charles for help.

Charles cleared his throat, took a check from his pocket, unfolded it, and placed it on the coffee table, saying, "Here's eighty thousand dollars. We're returning it to you. Isabella is very important to Matthew. Please give her back to us."

Sebastian laughed, "How do you know she's not important to me?"

"Sebastian!" Charles restrained his anger and said "Don't go too far. Matthew is your brother. He's sick right now. Are you really going to compete with him?"

"I'm competing with him?" Sebastian sneered, "You really haven't changed, always unable to tell right from wrong. He's always the one competing with me. When have I ever competed with him? Even if I did, what could you do about it? Beat me until I let go, like when we were kids?"

"You!" Charles was about to lose his temper but was stopped by Emma.

Emma looked at Sebastian, softening her tone, "Sebastian, I'm begging you. Help Matthew. He's really very sick and can't be without Isabella."

Sebastian ignored her, looking away, "Isabella is a person, not an object. You can't just buy her for eighty thousand dollars. You're so confident, but have you ever asked for her opinion?"

###chapter 138  Don't Give Me That

Emma was taken aback and then looked at Isabella, saying, "Bella, after Matthew found out about this, he locked himself in the studio. He smashed the entire studio to pieces. We only found out that he ran out of the studio in the middle of night. Bella, please, have pity on me and help Matthew, okay?"

Charles also looked at Isabella full of anticipation.

Isabella had a soft personality and was the worst at refusing others.

Just as Isabella was about to speak, her wrist was grabbed by Sebastian. He said, "Enough of this. Isabella is not a psychologist, so she can't help Matthew. If you have time, why not find him a psychologist? Eight thousand dollars should be enough."

At this moment, a voice came from the stairs, "Let Matthew move in and live with us!"

Everyone turned around and saw Zoe coming down the stairs.

"Zoe." Emma wiped her tears and went up to her, "Did we make too much noise and wake you up?"

Zoe glanced at her indifferently, then turned to Sebastian and asked, "Sebastian, what do you think?"

Isabella could see that Sebastian didn't want Matthew to stay.

But Sebastian had to listen to Zoe.

In the end, Matthew stayed.

Back in the bedroom, Isabella was pulled over by Sebastian.

She looked up and noticed that Sebastian's expression was very serious.

"What's wrong?" she asked.

"Do you still like Matthew?" Sebastian stared into her eyes and asked.

Isabella shook her head. "No, I don't."

Sebastian's expression softened a bit and said, "Letting him stay was Grandma's idea. Bella, keep your distance from him!"

"Okay." Isabella nodded and obediently agreed.

The next morning, Isabella went downstairs to make breakfast.

She had just put the macaroni and cheese in the pot when a warm chest pressed against her from behind, gently hugging her.

Isabella smiled. Maybe because of her peaceful mind in the morning and the comforting hug, so she didn't resist. She leaned back closer and said, "When I got up, you were still asleep. How did you wake up so quickly?"

The person behind her didn't speak and just tightened the arm around her waist slightly, seemingly displeased with her words.

Isabella was startled and turned her head to look back, only to see Matthew's face.

"Ah!" she screamed and pushed Matthew away forcefully, her waist hitting the edge of the dining table.

Matthew staggered back a few steps, his hand reaching back and accidentally knocking over a bowl on the table.

The bowl shattered on the floor.

Matthew looked at Isabella with dark eyes, then silently squatted down to pick up the broken pieces.

"What happened?" Sebastian's figure appeared at the kitchen door.

As he saw the scene in the kitchen, his expression darkened.

He walked quickly to Isabella, frowning, and asked, "Did he touch you?"

Isabella, afraid that Sebastian would clash with Matthew, quickly shook her head and said, "No, Matthew accidentally broke the bowl. I'm fine."

She tightly clutched Sebastian's sleeve with a slightly pale face.

When seeing the macaroni and cheese in the pot start to boil, Sebastian turned down the heat and then noticed Isabella still looking at Matthew on the floor. He frowned, grabbed her chin, and turned her face away.

Then Sebastian lowered his head and kissed Isabella, ignoring Matthew's presence.

Isabella just felt a tingling in her palm. The next second, Sebastian had pinned her against the dining table, pulling her into his arms and kissing her hard.

Matthew had stopped picking up the pieces at some point, still squatting on the floor, looking up at the scene with a blank expression. He clenched the shards in his hand tighter and tighter, oblivious to the blood dripping from his hands.

After breakfast, Isabella and Sebastian left the villa together, driving to the Landon Group.

As soon as they left, Matthew put down his utensils.

Zoe noticed and asked, "Matthew, aren't you eating?"

Matthew, unable to speak due to a throat injury, just shook his head and went upstairs.

Sebastian's car pulled into the underground parking lot of the Landon Group building. As soon as the car stopped, Sebastian unbuckled his seatbelt and pulled Isabella onto his lap.

Isabella looked puzzled at him.

"Just hold me for a while," Sebastian said.

Isabella was speechless.

Since yesterday, she had fully experienced how clingy Sebastian could be.

No one would have thought that Sebastian, usually a cold and domineering CEO, was such a clingy person in private.

"It's time to go up," Isabella nudged Sebastian. "You have a meeting at eight."

Sebastian glanced at the time dissatisfiedly, saying, "One more minute."

A minute passed, but Sebastian didn't let go. Instead, his hand slipped under Isabella's shirt.

Isabella blushed and pressed down his hand,saying, "Mr. Landon!"

At that moment, a car pulled up next to Sebastian's. After two honks, the window rolled down, revealing Zaire.

Sebastian frowned, withdrew his hand, and adjusted Isabella's shirt before letting her out of the car.

Isabella, blushing, got out and greeted Zaire. "Mr. Jose."

"Ms. Miller, your face is so red." Zaire smirked at Sebastian and said, "Mr. Landon must have turned up the AC too high, making you hot."

Isabella didn't know how to respond. She was shy and couldn't handle teasing, so she said, "I'll head up first."

Then she quickly walked away.

Watching her retreating figure, Zaire laughed, saying, "This Mimosa is quite interesting."

Upon his saying, Zaire felt a chill on the back of his neck.

He turned to see Sebastian's hostile and wary gaze. He paused and then laughed, "Sebastian, you're so jealous now?"

"Is there anything you need?" Sebastian asked coldly, a stark contrast to his earlier warmth with Isabella. He didn't even bother to smile at Zaire.

"Let's talk in your office," Zaire said, starting to walk away.

But Sebastian stopped him and said, "Let's talk here."

Zaire looked around and said, "Here?"

"Yes," Sebastian said seriously.

"We've known each other for years, and this is the first time you've refused me. Didn't I always hang out in your office for hours?"

"That was before. Now I have a girlfriend, and it's not convenient for you to be in my office."

Zaire was speechless.

He stared at Sebastian for a while and said, "Do you know what I want to do right now?"

Sebastian glanced at him and said indifferently, "Do whatever you want. I'm not interested."

"Alright, Sebastian, you've changed. You found a woman and now you're ditching your friends?" Zaire said, feigning heartbreak. "Have you forgotten who stood by you through ups and downs all these years? Have you forgotten who sat with you at every banquet, despite the pressure? I've stayed single all these years for you. Now you have a girlfriend, and you abandon me first?"

Sebastian frowned slightly and said, "I stayed single because I didn't want to be with anyone. But you stayed single because Susan dumped you and you've never gotten over it."

###chapter 139  Isabella and I Forever

Zaire's eyes widened, and he said, "Say that again!"

"I can say it ten times and it's still the same. You're flipping out today because Susan is coming back, right?"

Zaire's expression froze.

Sebastian smirked, "Look at you, acting all worthless. She's coming back, so just get ready."

"Ready for what?"

Sebastian raised an eyebrow and said, "Do you need me to teach you?"

"No need." Zaire's expression turned aggrieved, "I just came here to talk. Since you're busy being in love, I'll leave."

"Take care."

Zaire paused, baring his teeth, "Sebastian, you better stay happy for the rest of your life. If I ever get the chance, I'll gloat over your frustration."

Sebastian laughed, "Don't worry. Isabella and I will last forever."

Sebastian was very busy during the day, while Isabella was bored out of her mind.

After finishing her work, Isabella was about to go to the restroom when the desk phone rang.

She was a small assistant, and almost no one ever called her on the internal line.

The number on the screen was from the company's front desk.

Isabella picked up the phone, and the voice on the other end said, "Isabella, someone is here to see you downstairs."

"Okay."

Isabella found it strange. She hung up the phone and still went straight downstairs without even going to the restroom.

As soon as she exited the elevator, Isabella saw Nina.

She was stunned and quickly ran over, "Sis, what are you doing here?"

Nina's attire was out of place in the upscale building. The receptionist had offered her a cup of milk tea and asked her to wait in the lounge. But Nina was too uneasy and insisted on standing there.

When seeing Isabella, she felt much more at ease, "Bella."

As soon as she spoke, Nina's eyes reddened.

"What happened?" Isabella asked worriedly, "Did Charlie hit you again?"

Nina shook her head and said, "He didn't hit me."

The lobby was crowded, making it inconvenient to talk. Nina also didn't want to affect Isabella's work, so they walked out of the Landon Group building.

Isabella was anxious,saying, "Nina, hurry up and tell me what happened."

Knowing Nina's personality, Isabella knew she wouldn't come to her unless it was something serious. If it were something minor, Nina would have mentioned it over the phone. So her coming directly to the company indicated that it was quite serious.

Seeing no one around, Nina finally said, "I had a huge fight with him yesterday. He didn't come home all night and hasn't answered his phone. Bella, I feel terrible and uncomfortable."

Nina indeed looked unwell.

Isabella said, "I'll take you to the hospital right away."

Nina nodded, feeling completely relieved with Isabella by her side.

At the hospital, the doctor performed a series of tests on Nina.

"Your pregnancy is not very stable. Have you been overworking or emotionally distressed lately?"

Nina asked, "Can emotions affect the baby?"

"Of course. Since you're in the early stages of pregnancy, maintain a positive mindset is crucial. You also need to get plenty of rest. If you feel unwell, come to the hospital immediately. Don't try to tough it out." The doctor gave a lot of instructions.

Nina agreed to everything but seemed distracted as she sat there.

"Sis, did Charlie upset you?" Isabella asked as they left the hospital, pulling out her phone to call Charlie.

Nina stopped her, saying, "Yesterday's issue wasn't entirely his fault."

Nina didn't know how to explain.

But Isabella quickly guessed the crux of the matter. She said, "His mom and brother haven't left yet?"

"No." Nina closed her eyes, "His mom says the city is better than the countryside, with more opportunities and faster money. She's been helping Raymond find a job and plans to stay."

Isabella wasn't surprised by this outcome.

Deborah seemed like a schemer, and Raymond was a eccentric person.

And then there was Charlie.

Just thinking about it gave Nina a headache.

Under Isabella's persistent questioning, Nina finally revealed what happened yesterday.

It turned out Nina had bought a box of kiwis yesterday, which led to Deborah nagging her. Nina, full of pent-up frustration, vented to Charlie.

It was originally a small matter, and Nina would have let it go after a few words.

But Deborah wouldn't let it go and criticized Nina in front of Charlie.

Their argument escalated, and Charlie stormed out, not returning all night.

Deborah, on the other hand, had pulled up a chair and sat outside Nina's bedroom door, nagging non-stop.

Nina was almost driven to a nervous breakdown. With nowhere else to go, she wandered the streets for half a day before going to the Landon Group to find Isabella.

After hearing everything, Isabella's chest heaved with anger. "I'll go back with you and confront them!"

But Nina shook her head, looking exhausted, "I don't want to go back right now."

If she went back, she'd have to listen to Deborah's nagging again.

She was really scared.

With nowhere else to go, Isabella took Nina back to her dorm.

Just as she finished getting hot water, Sebastian called.

He asked where Isabella was.

Isabella had to tell the truth.

Sebastian said he wanted to come over, but Isabella refused, saying she wanted to spend time with Nina.

Nina saw her blush while on the phone and couldn't help but ask, "Who is that?"

"Sebastian."

Nina was surprised, "Why would you call him by his name?"

Isabella hesitated and then told Nina about her and Sebastian.

She also mentioned Sebastian's breakup with Vanessa.

Nina was silent for a while after hearing this. She then suddenly asked, "Bella, be honest with me. Is the baby Sebastian's?"

Isabella was shocked, "Sis, how did you know?!"

"I guessed." Nina's expression was not surprised but rather relieved. "When I asked you before, you wouldn't say who the father was. You'd rather offend the Landon family than involve Matthew. If the baby wasn't Sebastian's, how could you accept him so quickly?"

It wasn't hard to guess. Knowing Isabella's dull personality, if not for the baby, her relationship with Sebastian wouldn't have progressed so quickly.

Isabella felt a bit embarrassed, "Actually, I haven't fully accepted him yet."

Everything was a blur.

Isabella didn't even know how things had progressed to this point and every step was unexpected.

"Sebastian doesn't seem to know about the baby. When do you plan to tell him?"

Isabella shook her head, "I haven't decided yet."

She didn't know how to bring it up.

With Vanessa gone, it would have been easier to tell him.

But Zoe's words from the previous night still echoed in her ears.

Isabella thought, since she wouldn't lose the baby, she could wait until she figured things out before making a decision.

Nina thought for a moment and said, "since he doesn't know about the baby, you don't need to tell him right away."

###chapter 140  Call Me Husband

"Why?" Isabella wondered, "I think if I told him, he would be very happy."

"Bella, I'm worried he might not be sincere. Anyway, the child is his, and he will find out the truth sooner or later. We can use this to test him for a while. If he truly cares for you, then everyone will be happy when the baby is born. If he's not sincere, then there's no need to tell him at all."

Isabella thought about it and found it reasonable, "Okay, I'll listen to you, Nina."

"By the way, Nina ,there's something else I need to discuss with you. Do you know the Jose family?"

Nina thought for a moment and shook her head, "No, I don't know. What's up?"

"Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith want to adopt me as their goddaughter. They also said I should come back and discuss it with you, asking if you have time this weekend because they want to talk to you in person."

"Why so suddenly?" Nina was a bit skeptical. "Is it because of Sebastian?"

Isabella shook her head. "The Jose family's daughter is my colleague. Last time, I stayed at the Jose family's place for a night, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith liked me a lot, so they brought it up. If you don't agree, I'll turn them down."

Nina smiled, "This is a good thing. Why wouldn't I agree? Having one more person to love you, I'm very happy about that."

"Really?"

"Yes. Go ahead and arrange it. I'll meet them this weekend and talk in person."

"Okay."

Nina was in a bad mood, and Isabella didn't feel comfortable leaving her alone.

So she sent Sebastian a message, saying she would stay with Nina.

Sebastian replied: [Okay.]

In the evening, after Isabella and Nina returned from dinner at the cafeteria, they saw a black car parked outside the girls' dormitory.

Isabella was stunned.

Nina noticed her reaction and glanced at her. "Is it Sebastian's car?"

"Yes."

Nina smiled and let go of her hand. "I'll go up first."

With that, she walked away.

Isabella hesitated for a moment before walking over.

As she approached the car, the door opened from the inside, and a hand reached out to grab her wrist, pulling her inside.

Isabella fell into Sebastian's warm embrace. Before she could say anything, Sebastian kissed her.

It was a long time before Sebastian let her go, his fingers lingering on her cheek. "Why didn't you tell me you were coming out?"

"I forgot it," Isabella said, "Why are you here?"

"I have something for you." Sebastian placed her on the seat, then took a box from behind and handed it to her.

Isabella curiously asked, "What's this?"

"Open it and see."

Isabella opened it to find a necklace inside.

Even in the dim light of the car, the necklace's brilliance couldn't be hidden.

Isabella looked at the necklace, and Sebastian looked at her.

"Do you like it?"

Isabella nodded.

No girl disliked jewelry.

"Why do you suddenly give me this?"

Sebastian's gaze swept over her slender neck. "I always felt it was missing something."

Isabella blushed. "Thank you."

"Want me to put it on you?" Although it was a question, Sebastian didn't give Isabella a chance to refuse. His fingers were already lifting the necklace, unclasping it, and he leaned over.

The necklace was slightly cool against her skin.

Isabella leaned on Sebastian's shoulder, her heart pounding.

After putting the necklace on her, Sebastian looked at it for a while and said, "It looks nice."

There was no mirror in the car, so Isabella couldn't see it, but his compliment made her heart warm.

"Aren't you going to thank me?" Sebastian looked at her flushed cheeks, feeling very pleased.

Isabella was taken aback and honestly thanked him, "Thank you, Mr. Landon."

"I have a suggestion," Sebastian suddenly said.

"What is it?" Isabella looked up at him.

"From now on, call me by my name in private."

Sebastian wanted to hear Isabella call his name. It would surely be very comforting.

Isabella looked at his expectant eyes, "Sebastian Landon?"

Sebastian shook his head, "Drop the last name."

"Isn't that inappropriate?"

"What's inappropriate?" Sebastian's gaze locked onto her, and he continued, "Or you can call me something else."

Without thinking, Isabella said, "I choose the latter."

It was better than calling him by his first name directly.

"Then call me hubby."

In just a few seconds, Isabella was stunned.

Sebastian had a gentle smile on his face, but there was no hint of joking in his expression. Instead, he seriously asked her, "What do you say?"

Before Isabella could answer, Sebastian leaned in closer.

"Try calling me hubby."

Isabella blushed and pushed him. "That's not appropriate."

Sebastian's hand caressed her waist through her clothes, his voice growing deeper. "What's inappropriate? Tell me and we can improve it?"

Isabella's hands pressed against the seat, her face red, she stammering, "That's a term for married couples."

They had just confirmed their relationship.

Sebastian wanted her to call himÂ hubby right after confirming their relationship, and Isabella felt it hard to speak.

Sebastian leaned his forehead against hers. "So you're eager to get married and be my wife?"

Isabella was speechless.

That was not what she meant!

Sebastian's hand slipped under Isabella's clothes, he pinching her waist lightly. "Say it!"

Isabella shivered uncontrollably and instinctively called out, "Hubby."

Sebastian seemed greatly satisfied. "Good girl."

Nina stayed in Isabella's dorm for three days.

During these three days, Isabella went to work during the day and returned to the dorm to accompany her at night.

Nina's phone was always off.Â Charlie neither called Isabella to ask about her nor came to the dorm to find her.

Isabella was afraid of making Nina sad, so she didn't mention Charlie at all.

When the weekend arrived, Sebastian came to pick them up for dinner at the Jose family's place.

Nina got up early and used Isabella's makeup to put on a light makeup.

She rarely wore makeup. And Isabella was stunned, "Nina, you're so beautiful."

Nina smiled, "I just don't want to embarrass you."

She had been in low spirits these past few days, and her face had turned quite pale. Since the Jose family was wealthy, Nina didn't want to embarrass Isabella on their first meeting.

After they got ready and went downstairs, Sebastian's car was already waiting.

As they walked over, Sebastian had already gotten out of the car.

"Nina, this is Mr. Landon you met before." Isabella introduced somewhat awkwardly.

Sebastian extended his hand naturally and greeted, "Nina. "

Nina was taken aback.

It wasn't anything else, but Sebastian's presence was too shocking. Nina, who had lived at the bottom of society, wasn't used to being addressed as that by someone like him.

Isabella was also slightly surprised. She turned to look at Sebastian, who was full of sincerity, which moved her deeply.

###chapter 141  Disagreement

As the car moved out of Harvard University, Nina said, "Let's find a place to buy some gifts. It's not appropriate to visit empty-handed for the first time."

Sebastian nodded. "The gifts are already prepared. They're all in the trunk."

Nina looked at him. "How much did they cost? I'll transfer the money to you, Mr. Landon."

"We're family, so there is no need to be so formal, Nina."

Sebastian's words left the car silent for a few seconds.

Isabella looked at Sebastian with admiration.

Sebastian calling her sister sounded even more natural than her.

Nina seemed to think of something, and after a brief moment of distraction, a slight smile finally appeared on her face. "Alright."

When they arrived at the Jose household, Zaire and Kelsey came out to greet them personally.

"Isabella, my mom is cooking herself today," Kelsey said warmly, holding Isabella's arm.

She then looked at Nina. "And this must be Nina. Hi, I'm Kelsey."

"Hello."

Nina noticed that Kelsey was about the same age as Isabella, but their personalities were different. Isabella was introverted, while Kelsey was more flamboyant, like a blooming flower, carefree and unrestrained.

Nina always felt that Isabella was too gentle. It would be good for her to spend more time with someone like Kelsey, who might influence her a bit.

As they walked into the Jose household's living room, Steven had just finished a conference call and came downstairs.

"Dad." Kelsey walked over. "Isabella and Nina are here."

Steven's gaze swept over Isabella's face and then landed on Nina's.

For a moment, Nina's expression froze.

At that moment, Margaret also walked out of the kitchen. "Bella, here you here."

"Aunt Margaret," Isabella greeted politely.

Nina followed the voice and looked at Margaret.

A look of surprise flashed in Nina's eyes, and then she stood there in a daze.

Isabella gently tugged at her sleeve. "Sis, this is Mrs. Smith."

"Mrs. Smith," Nina murmured.

Margaret looked her up and down, smiled, and extended her hand. "I'm Kelsey's mom. You can call me Aunt Margaret, just like Bella does."

Nina didn't respond.

"Nina?" Isabella noticed her unusual behavior and gently reminded her.

Nina finally came to her senses and shook Margaret's hand, her tone distant and unfamiliar, "Mrs. Smith."

Margaret was taken aback.

Isabella also looked at Nina in confusion. Nina's words clearly intended to distance herself from the entire Jose family.

Fortunately, Margaret didn't mind. She smiled and said, "Let's all go to the dining room. Dinner is almost ready."

Everyone headed to the dining room, but Nina held Isabella's hand. "Bella, come out with me for a moment."

In the Jose household courtyard.

"Nina, what's wrong?"

Nina glanced at the Jose household villa, then looked at Isabella with a serious expression. "Isabella, to be honest, why do they suddenly want to adopt you as a goddaughter? What's their real motive?"

Isabella was taken aback. "Mrs. Smith likes me."

"There are so many people and why does she like you specifically? Do you really think you're so adorable? Isabella, have you ever thought about the reason?"

Nina's strong reaction was something Isabella didn't expect.

"Nina, what's wrong? Weren't you happy about this?"

"That's because I hadn't met them yet!"

"You mean Uncle Steven and Aunt Margaret?"

Isabella didn't understand. Steven and Margaret were clearly nice and easygoing. Nina had always been good-tempered, but why did her attitude change so much after meeting them?

Nina bit her lip, her eyes a bit red. "Bella, I don't agree!"

Isabella was shocked.

"Why?" Nina looked into her eyes. "Are you reluctant?"

Nina looked away, gazing into the distance. "If you want to acknowledge this relationship, then you and I will no longer be sisters. From now on, you'll be part of the Jose family and I won't care about you anymore!"

With that, she turned and walked away.

"Sis!" Isabella caught up and grabbed her hand. "Sis, don't say that. In this world, you are my only family. Please don't abandon me."

"Alright!" Nina nodded. "Then let's go back now and make things clear with them!"

Isabella didn't hesitate. "Okay."

When the two of them walked into the Jose household dining room, everyone was already seated and chatting happily.

Margaret had changed her clothes. Seeing Isabella, she smiled brightly, "Bella, come sit by me."

Isabella was about to speak when Nina squeezed her hand tightly.

"Sorry, Mrs. Smith, I have to refuse your kindness," Nina said.

Upon her saying, dining room fell silent for a long time.

Kelsey was the first to react. "Why? We already agreed, so why..."

"Agreed?" Nina looked at Kelsey indifferently, her gaze different from when she looked at her in the courtyard earlier. "May I ask, Ms. Jose, who did you agree with?"

Kelsey was at a loss for words. "Well, you agreed to come today to discuss this in person, didn't you? Why did you change your mind?"

Everyone looked at Nina, not understanding why she suddenly changed her mind.

Nina looked at Margaret. "May I ask, Mrs. Smith, why do you want to adopt Isabella as your goddaughter? We are just ordinary people. Don't you think it'll disgrace you to adopt someone like us? Moreover, we can't offer you any benefits. What's the real reason behind this? I really can't figure it out."

Isabella bit her lip.

Tonight, Nina was unlike her usual gentle self. She seemed to be unapproachable today, and her words were unprecedentedly sharp and harsh.

"Are you implying that we have ulterior motives toward Isabella?" Kelsey couldn't help but retort.

"Kelsey!" Margaret scolded softly, "Ms. Miller is a guest and Isabella's sister. Don't be rude."

Kelsey pouted and thought, ' Fine, for Isabella's sake, I will not argue with Nina.'

Margaret looked at Nina again. Â Being a woman of high status, Margaret remained gentle and refined. Even in the face of Nina's confrontation, Margaret maintained her composure and softly explained, "Ms. Miller, please believe that we have no ulterior motives toward Isabella. I want to adopt her as a goddaughter simply because I like her."

"You like her?" Nina sneered at those words. "There are so many people you might like in this world. Are you going to adopt all of them as goddaughters, Mrs. Smith?"

Margaret was speechless.

Nina's words were quite harsh, and the atmosphere in the dining room became tense and delicate.

Kelsey looked at Nina angrily.

Even Zaire raised his eyes and looked at Nina deeply.

Margaret sighed, her smile tinged with bitterness, "To be honest, Ms. Miller, many years ago, I lost a daughter. We've been searching for her all these years, but we haven't found any trace of her. When I first met Isabella, I felt a strong sense of familiarity. Then we did a DNA test, but Isabella is not my lost daughter. So..."

"So you want to use Isabella to fill the guilt left by your lost daughter? It seems that your lost daughter doesn't mean much to you, Mrs. Smith!"

###chapter 142 Squeeze In

Margaret's eyes reddened. "Ms. Miller."

Nina's eyes were also red, but she tried hard to hold back, channeling all her strength into her hands.

Isabella felt her trembling and a hint of suppressed anger.

But Nina's face was full of cold sarcasm. "Since you can't find your own daughter, so you use someone else's daughter as a replacement. Are you trying to make up for the loss of your daughter or are you trying to cover up the fact that you lost your daughter, Mrs. Smith!"

"Enough!" Steven stood up, looking at Margaret's face, which was pale, his eyes filled with concern.

He walked to Margaret's side, steadied her shoulders with his hands, and looked at Nina. "Ms. Miller, whether you believe it or not, our desire to make Isabella our goddaughter has no ulterior motives. We thought it would be a joyous occasion for everyone, but since you disagree..."

Steven glanced at Isabella's face. "Then I can only say it's a pity. Zaire, see them out!"

Zaire stood up.

"No need to send us out, we will leave," Nina said, pulling Isabella away.

Sebastian patted Zaire's shoulder and got up to follow them out.

Outside the Jose family home, Isabella stopped. "Nina, are you okay?"

Nina sniffed, holding back her tears.

She turned to look at Isabella. "Bella, why did you hide the fact that you did a DNA test with the Jose family?"

"I'm sorry, Nina. I didn't think it was that important, so I didn't tell you."

"Isabella, you really have grown up, haven't you? You didn't tell me anything and did a DNA test with strangers. Do you think that's not important? Or do you just want to be the lost daughter of the Jose family, so you can be their eldest daughter after the test?"

Isabella was stunned. "Sis, I didn't."

As soon as she finished speaking, a hand landed on her shoulder.

Sebastian, who had somehow ended up behind Isabella, put an arm around her and said to Nina, "Isabella is not that kind of person."

"I know." Nina's mood calmed a bit. "Bella, let's end this matter here for today. I'm going home."

"I'll go with you." Isabella took a couple of steps forward.

Nina waved her hand. "I've been staying in your dorm for a few days. It's time for me to go back. You don't need to worry about me."

With that, she walked away.

Watching Nina's retreating figure, Isabella was still worried and wanted to follow, but Sebastian held her shoulder.

"Your sister might not want to hear your explanation right now." Sebastian comforted Isabella. "I think she's quite upset tonight. Let her have some time alone."

Isabella felt he was right, but she still couldn't help but worry.

Sebastian had the driver bring the car over. "Get in. We'll follow her and make sure she gets home safely."

Isabella felt a warmth in her heart. Sebastian always thought things through so thoroughly. "Thank you, Mr. Landon."

Sebastian smiled, "Still calling me Mr. Landon?"

Thinking of Sebastian's earlier suggestion, Isabella blushed and quickly got into the car without responding.

They followed Nina all the way until the taxi dropped her off at Green Valley Community. They watched her enter the building and waited until the hallway lights went out before Sebastian instructed the driver to head home.

Isabella was a bit down. "I've never seen my sister so angry before."

Sebastian was silent for a moment and then said, "She seems to have some issues with Uncle Steven and Aunt Margaret. When she first met Zaire and Kelsey, she seemed quite normal."

Hearing this, Isabella also felt the same.

Everything was harmonious until Margaret appeared.

"Don't think about it." Sebastian reached out and touched Isabella's cheek. "Are you hungry?"

Before Isabella could answer, her stomach growled.

"Yes." Isabella laughed sheepishly.

Sebastian took her hand, his smile gentle. "Let's go to eat something delicious ."

"Okay."

The Jose family.

After Isabella and the others left, the Jose family didn't continue their meal.

Margaret felt unwell and went to rest in her room.

Steven naturally accompanied her.

Downstairs, only Zaire and Kelsey were left.

Thinking about what had happened, Kelsey was quite angry. She said, "I can't believe that Isabella, who has such a good temper, has such a grumpy sister. If she didn't agree, why did she come to our house tonight? And then she said those things. Mom cares the most about our sister andÂ we can't even say a word. But that Nina! Every word she said was like a stab to Mom's heart. If it weren't for Isabella and Sebastian, I really would have torn her apart!"

Kelsey kept ranting, while Zaire remained relatively calm. He had been sitting there, frowning and saying nothing, as if deep in thought.

At that moment, his phone rang.

Just as Zaire reached for his phone, Kelsey grabbed it first.

"Annie, who is this, with such a low-class name?"

Kelsey only had time to see the sender's nickname before Zaire took the phone back.

He flicked her forehead. "Kids should stay out of grown-up matters!"

Kelsey chased after him and said, "Zaire, you're only a few years older than me, so what makes you a grown-up?"

Isabella didn't expect to run into Jack and Nancy while out for a meal right at the restaurant entrance.

Nancy greeted them enthusiastically, "Mr. Landon, Ms. Miller, what a coincidence. You'reÂ also here to eat?"

Because of previous events, Isabella didn't have a good impression of Nancy. Coupled with Kelsey's influence, Isabella didn't feel like responding to Nancy's enthusiasm. Out of politeness, she only nodded slightly.

Nancy then looked at Sebastian, her eyes full of innocence.

Isabella instinctively looked at Sebastian, only to find that he wasn't even looking at Nancy. From the moment they met, he had been looking at Jack, not even reacting to Nancy's greeting.

The four of them exchanged brief greetings and entered the restaurant.

At the front desk, Jack gave the reserved phone number.

Nancy, standing beside him, said, "You need to make a reservation in advance at this restaurant. Jack called a week ago to reserve. Mr. Landon, Ms. Miller, when did you make your reservation?"

Isabella didn't know that dining here required such planning and truthfully said, "We didn't."

The decision to eat here was spontaneous, and Sebastian had chosen the place.

Isabella looked at Sebastian, wondering if he had made a reservation.

Sebastian said, "No reservation."

Nancy laughed, "Then how about you two join us?"

"Nancy!" Jack tugged at her.

Nancy blinked her innocent eyes at him. "Jack, it's lively to have more people eat together, and Mr. Landon is your boss. Having a couple more people is not a big deal. I won't mind."

"No need." Isabella refused.

Jack and Nancy were a couple, and it wouldn't be right for her and Sebastian to intrude.

"Oh, it's no trouble," Nancy interrupted Isabella. "You don't need to be so distant from us."

As she finished speaking, a man in a suit, Joshua Garcia, approached, followed by two waiters.

Nancy glanced at Joshua's name tag and realized he was the restaurant manager.

Joshua walked straight to Sebastian, bowed slightly, and said, "Mr. Landon, I didn't know you were coming. It's my fault for not welcoming you properly."

###chapter 143 He said, "My fiancÃ©e"

Sebastian looked calm, "I brought my fiancÃ©e for a meal."

Joshua was momentarily stunned as his gaze shifted between Nancy and Isabella, trying to guess who Sebastian's fiancÃ©e was.

Sebastian put his arm around Isabella's shoulder and introduced her to Joshua, "This is my fiancÃ©e. Her name is Isabella Miller. From now on, if she comes here to eat, she doesn't need to pay."

Joshua put on a smile. "Of course. The private room you always use is available.Â Mr. Landon, Ms. Miller, please follow me."

Sebastian walked into the elevator with Isabella.

Nancy also tried to follow but was stopped by Jack.

"Where are you going?"

Nancy glanced at the elevator and the doors had already closed.

Feeling slightly awkward, Nancy said, "I was thinking of joining them."

"Our seats are downstairs, so we don't need to take the elevator," Jack told her.

Nancy was stunned for a moment and then looked around the hall.

Actually, this restaurant was very high-end and the hall was also exquisitely decorated. Although it was the hall, there were not many dining tables. Each table was separated by semi-transparent screens, providing enough privacy.

"What about upstairs?" Nancy asked.

"Upstairs is for private rooms."

The waiter led the two to a table, then Jack handed the menu to Nancy.

Nancy opened the menu but was somewhat distracted. "The private rooms must be nicer than downstairs, right?"

"Yes." Jack nodded. "And they are several times more expensive."

Nancy bit her lip and suddenly lost interest.

After ordering, Jack didn't start eating immediately but looked at Nancy. "Weren't you going to take pictures for your status?"

Nancy took a few casual shots. "Done."

But Nancy didn't post the status and she didn't even bother to edit the photos. She put down her phone and started eating.

Jack tried to talk to her, but Nancy only responded indifferently.

Her phone screen lit up suddenly.

She glanced at it casually. Then her eyes lit up, and she grabbed her phone, smiling at the screen.

"Who's messaging you?" Jack asked.

"It's from a friend," Nancy replied casually, fiddling with her phone.

Jack thought she was posting a status. After a couple of minutes, he checked his own phone to see her status.

Jack wanted to like her post, but he refreshed for a long time and still didn't see Nancy's status update.

At this moment, Nancy was sitting across from him, still smiling foolishly at her phone.

Jack frowned, closed the status app, and opened Nancy's WhatsApp profile.

Her WhatsApp profile picture was a photo of herself.

It was a carefully edited photo, very pretty and sweet.

Jack noticed Nancy's new nickname. "Have you changed your nickname?"

Nancy's previous nickname was Purple Starry Sky, a name that she had begged Jack to come up with when she first registered. She had once hugged Jack and told him that she would never change her WhatsApp name for her entire life.

Nancy looked up and explained, "My classmates said my WhatsApp name was too lame, so I changed it into something more trendy. Do you like it, Jack?"

The Nancy in front of him had long forgotten her promise to never change her nickname.

"As long as you like it," Jack said sullenly.

Nancy smiled at him and then continied messaging.

Jack watched Nancy sitting across from him, silently put down his utensils, and said, "I'm going to the restroom."

"Okay." Nancy didn't even look up, her fingers still sliding across the screen as she sent the two photos she had just taken.

Zaire didn't reply.

Nancy asked again, "What are you doing now? Can you send me a picture of your surroundings?"

Zaire still didn't reply.

Nancy waited a few minutes. Just as she sighed in disappointment, Zaire replied.

It was a picture, a casual shot.

The angle was from a garden-like terrace, showing a pair of crossed legs and a delicate coffee table in the lower left corner.

Nancy zoomed in on the picture, took a screenshot, and immediately went on shopping apps to search for the bottle of red wine with foreign labels on the coffee table.

She searched all the shopping apps.

At this time, Jack returned from the restroom.

Nancy handed him the screenshot. "Jack, do you know this brand of red wine?"

Jack took a look. "Yes. It's a private brand from abroad."

"A private brand, so it shouldn't be expensive, right? I couldn't find it on any shopping app."

Jack shook his head. "This kind of wine isn't measured by price. It's like a key among the wealthy. And more often, you can't buy it with money."

Nancy's eyes lit up again. "So it's very precious if it can't be measured by money."

Jack looked at her deeply and asked, "Why did you suddenly ask about this?"

"I saw a friend post it and got curious, so I asked."

Jack remained silent for a long time and said, "Nancy, are you hiding something from me?"

Nancy shuddered, quickly turning off her phone screen. Then she forced a smile and said, "No, nothing."

"Nancy, big cities have both good and bad sides. Aunt and uncle sent you to me, so I will be responsible for you. Whatever you want, just tell me, and I will try my best to fulfill your wishes. But do not touch things you shouldn't. People should have self-awareness and we are all from humble backgrounds, so don't have excessive fantasies."

Nancy pressed her lips and replied insincerely, "Got it."

After hesitating for a while, Jack deleted the two chat screenshots that Zaire had just sent him and replied with a message: [Mr. Jose, I trust Nancy.]

Zaire, who received this message, laughed helplessly.

"Zaire, what are you laughing at?" Kelsey asked curiously from the side.

Zaire put away his phone and said slowly, "There are two things in this world that you can't look at directly."

"I know. One is the sun, and the other is the human heart."

Zaire shook his head.

Kelsey asked humbly, "Then what are they?"

Zaire leaned back in his chair, half-closed his eyes, and looked at the pitch-black night sky, saying with a sense of emotion, "One is when a person is love-struck."

Kelsey thought carefully and agreed, "You're right. A love-struck brain is something everyone should avoid."

Just like Jack who was actually love-struck!

"And the second?"

Zaire smiled slightly, "The secondÂ is that when smart people are love-struck."

After dinner, Isabella decided to call Nina.

But just as she took out her phone, Nina called her first.

She quickly answered, "Nina, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have kept the DNA test thing from you. From now on, I'll tell you everything. Please don't be mad at me, okay?"

Nina sighed, "Silly, I should say sorry to you."

"Nina."

They exchanged a few words, and then Nina said she had something to do and hung up.

After hanging up, Nina wiped her tears and turned to see Deborah standing at the door, looking at her coldly.

###chapter 144  Nina Gets into Trouble

Nina didn't want to say anything more to her and lifted her foot to enter the door.

Deborah sidestepped to block the door and said, "Were you just on the phone with Isabella?"

"Yeah." Nina's tone was laced with fatigue.

"Did you tell Isabella what I mentioned to you before? What did she say? Is she willing to date Raymond?"

Nina frowned and said, "Bella already has a boyfriend. Please don't bring this up again!"

"Stop lying to me!" Deborah didn't believe her and continued, "I asked Charlie. He said Isabella doesn't have a boyfriend, but she's already pregnant. I used to feel like our Raymond is trying to woo your sister, but nowÂ being pregnant out of wedlock isn't exactly something to brag about for her. Even though Raymond didn't go to college, he's considered quite a catch in our town. Many girls want to date him, but I don't think they're good enough. It's only because Raymond likes Isabella and she's your sister that we're willing to compromise. As long as Isabella is willing to abort the child and marry Raymond, we'll accept her."

Deborah's words made Nina laugh.

"If Raymond is so popular in the town, you should go back early. Don't delay Raymond's marriage and then blame it on me!"

After saying this, Nina didn't care how embarrassed Deborah looked. She pushed past her and went straight into the house.

Deborah's face turned ugly with anger and said, "Are you trying to kick me out?"

She was about to follow Nina inside to continue nagging, but Nina had already gone into the bedroom, slammed the door, and locked it .

Deborah pounded on the door loudly.

Nina covered her head with a pillow, but Deborah's incessant nagging and cursing still came through intermittently.

As she thought about everything that happened today, Nina's mood hit rock bottom. And under Deborah's provocation, her tears finally rolled uncontrollably down her face.

Isabella received the call in the middle of the night.

She and Sebastian hurried to the hospital, but Nina was still in the operating room.

Outside the operating room, Charlie and Deborah were waiting.

Seeing Isabella, Deborah immediately smiled, "Bella, you're here."

Isabella shook off her hand and looked at Charlie, saying, "If anything happens to my sister, I'll make sure you pay for it!"

Charlie glanced at Sebastian but said nothing.

Deborah said, "We're family. There's no need to say such harsh things. Nina is carrying our family's bloodline and we don't want anything to happen to her either!"

Isabella was so furious that she was trembling. She glared fiercely at Deborah.

Charlie pulled her aside and said, "Mom, stop saying anything."

Deborah felt wronged and said, "Alright, I'll mind my own business."

As she spoke, she glanced at Isabella and Sebastian.

When the door to the operating room opened, a doctor walked out, saying, "Who is the patient's family?"

"I am!" Charlie walked over. "Doctor, how is my wife?"

"The child may not be able to be saved, and there is a risk of severe bleeding for the adult. This is the informed consent form, please sign it. We need to perform a dilation and curettage procedure on the patient immediately."

"What?" Deborah stood next to Charlie, her face ashen. "My grandchild can't be saved?"

Even at this moment, she only cared about the baby and didn't concern about Nina's condition.

Isabella stepped forward and said to Charlie, "Hurry up and sign it!"

"Oh." Charlie was also scared out of his wits. He snapped out of it and immediately grabbed the pen.

Just as he was about to sign, Deborah stopped him.

"Doctor, is there really no way to save the baby?"

Upon her saying, everyone's eyes turned to her.

The doctor shook his head and said, "The pregnancy was already unstable, and now there's severe bleeding. You brought her in too late. Both the baby and the mother are at high risk. As a doctor, we prioritize saving the mother. As for the baby, they're still young, so they can have another one in the future."

Deborah sighed and looked distressed. "Oh, you don't know how much money and effort I spent to get the medicine for Nina to conceive. Now it's all wasted!"

Isabella couldn't hold back any longer and pushed Deborah aside. "Charlie, sign it!"

Charlie didn't hesitate anymore and quickly signed his name.

Deborah slumped against the wall and sat down on the ground, wailing and pounding her chest. She said, "You can't sign it! You can't sign it! It was so hard for Nina to conceive, and that's a living life!"

"A baby is a life, but isn't my sister a life too?" Isabella practically screamed the words.

She was usually gentle and rarely lost control like this.

Her outburst startled Deborah, who didn't dare to make any more noise.

Meanwhile.

Inside Casino No. 1, the air was thick with smoke and noise.

Michael pushed open the door and walked briskly to one of the gambling tables.

The cards had just been dealt, and all bets were placed.

Sitting at the head of the table, Richard glanced up at him. "What's the matter?"

Michael looked at the table, knowing this game was important to Richard. So he held back and said, "I'll wait until this round is over."

Richard's brows furrowed and he stood up immediately.

"Richard, the cards are about to be revealed. Where are you going?"

Richard walked around the table, leaving behind a single sentence and saying, "I fold."

The table erupted in surprise.

"Fold?"

"With such a good hand, he folded?"

"That's millions in bets!"

"What happened?"

The murmurs of the crowd were left behind by Richard.

He pushed open the door to a private room and stood by the sink to wash his hands.

Michael followed him in. "Richard, you folded such a good set of cards?"

Richard's expression didn't change. He finished washing his hands and slowly dried them with a couple of paper towels, saying, "Did something happen to Nina?"

"Yes."

Richard's fingers paused. He looked up at his reflection in the mirror. "Did her jerk husband do something bad again?"

Michael shook his head and said, "Nina had severe bleeding and was rushed to the hospital."

Richard spun around, his face suddenly stormy. "What did you say?"

"Don't worry. Our people said she was taken to the hospital. Our contacts there are already looking into it. We should have news soon."

The room fell into silence.

Richard turned his back, his hands braced on the edge of the sink, and thought for a moment. "I should go there myself."

Michael tried to stop him. "Richard, even if you go now, you won't be able to see Nina. Her family is all there."

Richard pushed his hand away and strode out. "I won't be at ease until I see her with my own eyes."

The light in the operating room stayed on.

With each passing second, Isabella felt her blood run colder.

Sebastian sat down next to her and gently hugged her. "Nina will be okay. Don't worry."

Looking into his eyes, Isabella felt a bit more at ease and stiffly nodded. "Yeah."

The operating room door opened again, and a nurse came out. "The patient urgently needs a blood transfusion. Are there any direct relatives here?"

###chapter 145  Rare Blood Type

The moment when the door to the operating room opened, Isabella immediately stood up.

Hearing the nurse's words, she quickly rolled up her sleeve. "Take mine. I'm her sister."

The nurse looked at her. "Are you also a rare blood type?"

Isabella was stunned and shook her head blankly. "I'm type B blood. I remember my sister is also type B blood?"

The nurse shook her head and said, "No, the patient's blood type is an extremely rare and precious type. Our hospital's blood bank has always been very scarce of this blood. She is bleeding heavily now and must have a transfusion, or her life will be in danger."

Isabella staggered back two steps, completely bewildered at this moment.

She had never even heard of the rare blood type.

A Â flash of something crossed Sebastian's eyes, and just as he was about to speak, a cold voice sounded from the end of the corridor, "Take mine."

A few people walked over from behind, led by Richard, who was wearing a black robe. Under the cold hospital lights, his fierce-looking face seemed much softened.

Isabella remembered the person, because she had seen Richard at the No. 1 Casino last time. Although she didn't know exactly who he was, he should be some big shot at the casino. Â Richard looked fierce. Even when he looked at people calmly, his eyes always revealed a frightening intensity that left a deep impression on Isabella.

His appearance here was highly unreasonable.

"Are you a rare blood type?" the nurse asked.

"Yes." Richard didn't look at anyone and only asked, "Where do I donate blood?"

"Follow me." The nurse nodded and led him inside.

In the operating room, the air conditioning was on. Richard followed the medical staff's instructions, changed into sterile clothing in the dressing room, lay on a stretcher, and was pushed inside.

He looked up and saw the surgery being performed over there.

Nina was covered in green surgical drapes, exposing only her abdomen and face.

Doctors surrounded her abdomen, performing various debridement procedures. Nina's eyes were closed, she wore an oxygen mask, and her face was as pale as paper, like a dead person.

Even Richard, who was accustomed to seeing deaths and had crawled out from piles of dead bodies, felt his heart being fiercely gripped at this sight.

His stretcher was pushed parallel to Nina's, and the nurse drew the curtain between them, inserting a needle into Richard.

Crimson blood slowly extended through the tube, transfusing bit by bit into Nina's body.

The surgery lasted about three hours.

Richard stayed inside for over an hour. When he came out, his face was somewhat pale.

Michael and the others immediately approached, draping a coat over his shoulders, supporting him.

"Richard, are you okay?"

Richard brushed them off, saying, "It's just a blood donation. It's not going to kill me."

He stood still, his eyes first falling on Charlie's face, pausing for a few seconds.

Charlie was startled by Richard's gaze, feeling his hair stand on end, a chill running up from his feet.

He recognized Rechard!

Richard was the person who had washed his hands in his home's atrium garden last time!

Also, he was the one who had crashed into him and sent him into the community flower bed earlier!

Charlie hadn't paid attention before, but now he realized that the man before was Richard!

And now Richard was here, donating blood to Nina!

Charlie didn't think it was a coincidence.

Could it be that Nina and Richard really had some connection?

Thinking of this, Charlie felt extremely uncomfortable and said, "Sir, thank you for donating blood to my wife and saving her life. May I know your name?"

"Richard's name is not some trash like you deserves to know."

"Richard?" Charlie didn't pay attention at first, but now the name sounded familiar, as if he had heard it somewhere before. Thinking carefully, he suddenly remembered, "You are the Richard of No. 1 Casino!"

As soon as he spoke, a fist came crashing down.

Charlie didn't have time to react and was hit on the nose. His entire nose felt sore and painful, tears streaming down uncontrollably.

"I told you that trash like you doesn't deserve to know Richard's name, and you still dared to say it out loud!" Michael shook his fist, almost spitting on Charlie's face.

"Charlie!" Deborah screamed and rushed forward to protect Charlie. "Charlie, are you okay?"

Michael's punch had made his nose bleed.

Deborah turned back and cursed at Michael, "You bastard, how dare you hit him?"

Deborah's curse made Michael extremely unhappy.

He flexed his wrist and threw another punch, aiming straight at Deborah's face.

Deborah was so frightened that she bent over and covered her face, screaming continuously.

"Help! He's hitting me!"

A nurse walked over. "This is a hospital. Please keep quiet!"

Deborah pointed at Michael. "He hit me!"

The nurse looked around.

Michael had already retracted his fist and stood quietly beside Richard, looking very well-behaved.

Meanwhile, Deborah was still exaggeratingly shouting.

The nurse frowned. "If you don't calm down, I'll have to ask you to leave."

Deborah immediately fell silent.

Michael looked at Charlie and Deborah with disdain and let out a cold sneer.

As for Richard, he stood quietly the whole time.

He didn't stop Michael from hitting anyone, his eyes always cold.

Isabella watched the whole scene and couldn't help but think that sometimes actions speak louder than words!

Seeing Charlie get beaten and Deborah being fooled, Isabella felt a sense of satisfaction.

She stepped forward and bowed to Richard. "Thank you."

Richard, who was very tall, looked down at her, his gaze surprisingly gentle. He said, "My last name is Cole."

Isabella was stunned and quickly said, "Mr. Cole, thank you for generously donating blood to my sister."

Richard nodded slightly. "It's the least I could do."

Isabella was bewildered.

Richard's words seemed out of place here.

After all, they didn't know each other.

Maybe Richard was very familiar with Nina.

Isabella was staring at Richard when she was suddenly pulled back.

As she fell into Sebastian's arms, Sebastian said, "I didn't expect that you also have a rare blood type. Truly remarkable, Mr. Cole."

Richard smiled slightly, "Sometimes rareness doesn't mean good."

Then he looked at Isabella. "When she wakes up, will you tell her?"

His words were vague, making it hard for Isabella to understand.

"Tell her what?"

Richard raised his arm with the needle mark. "I transfused blood to her."

Isabella was speechless.

Most people would say, "Don't tell her it was my blood."

But with Richard, it was different.

It seemed like he was afraid Nina wouldn't know it was his blood.

She nodded. "I will tell my sister the truth."

"That's good." Richard nodded. "I have something to do, so I'll leave now."

With that, Richard and his group left quickly.

Isabella watched Richard's disappearing figure and said, "He's quite interesting."

As she finished speaking, Sebastian's hand on her shoulder tightened abruptly.

###chapter 146 Jealous Seb

Isabella looked up and met Sebastian's slightly displeased eyes.

"Is he interesting?"

Isabella was speechless.

Sebastian was jealous.

Seeing Sebastian's face darkening, Isabella was just about to explain when the operating room door opened, and the medical staff pushed out a stretcher.

"Nina." Isabella hurried forward to tend to Nina.

Sebastian's hand was suddenly empty. He sighed helplessly and followed her.

After the rescue, Nina was out of danger and transferred to a regular ward.

But she was still unconscious.

Isabella stayed by the bedside, not allowing Charlie and Deborah to come near.

Charlie glanced from a distance and sought Sebastian's help. He said, "Mr. Landon, why don't you let Isabella go home? I can stay and take care of Nina."

Deborah quickly pulled him aside and whispered, "You have to work tomorrow. It's too late to take care of her."

"Mom, I'm fine."

"Fine? You're the pillar of our family. If something happens to you, we're doomed. Besides, she's just sleeping now. With so many doctors and nurses around, what could go wrong?"

Deborah and Charlie bickered.

Sebastian couldn't stand it anymore and said, "Yes, you have work tomorrow. It's late and you should go home and rest."

When she saw Sebastian support her, Deborah immediately smiled, "The boss understands you."

Sebastian looked at her indifferently. "Charlie can go home. You stay and take care of her."

Deborah was stunned, not expecting to be addressed. She quickly waved her hand. "I can't. I'm old and not in good health. It's so fortunate that I don't need others to look after me. Plus, this hospital is so advanced. I can't even use the elevator and would get lost as soon as I step out. I'd be a burden if I stayed."

Isabella saw all of Deborah's excuses.

She looked at Nina, feelingÂ sorrowful and grieved.

At this moment, she didn't want to hear their voices anymore and shouted, "Get out!"

Charlie looked at Sebastian.

He wasn't afraid of Isabella or Nina.

But he was most afraid of Sebastian.

After all, no one wasn't afraid of powerful people.

Nina and Isabella were no threat.

But Sebastian was someone he couldn't afford to offend.

Sebastian glanced at him lightly. "Didn't you hear? Do I need to repeat myself?"

Charlie quickly waved his hand. "No need, we're leaving."

With that, he dragged Deborah away.

After they left, Isabella said to Sebastian, "You should go rest too. I'll stay here with my sister."

Sebastian looked at her for a few seconds and then left the ward without a word.

Seeing this, Isabella felt upset.

Although she did tell Sebastian to leave, he left too decisively.

Pulling herself together, Isabella pulled up a chair by the bed and sat down, looking at Nina's pale face. She murmured, "Nina, do you regret your choice now?"

Isabella lay by the bedside, drowsily falling asleep.

Suddenly, she felt herself being lifted. She woke upÂ and saw Sebastian's face.

At that moment, he was holding her.

Instinctively, Isabella wrapped her arms around his neck. "Didn't you go home?"

Sebastian set her down on the sofa. "Who said I went home?"

Then why did he just leave so decisively?

Looking around, Isabella saw a large shopping bag on the table.

When she saw Sebastian taking out towels, a toothbrush, a rinsing cup, and other daily necessities, she was stunned again.

So Sebastian had gone to the supermarket.

Sebastian took a towel to the bathroom and quickly returned.

The towel was already wet. Isabella instinctively reached out to take it.

But Sebastian avoided her hand, stood in front of her, and wiped her face himself.

The warm towel touched Isabella's skin as he gently wiped, his movements full of tenderness.

Seeing Sebastian like this, Isabella accepted his care without hesitation, propping her hands on the edge of the sofa, tilting her face slightly, and closing her eyes to let him wipe.

When the towel left, Isabella suddenly felt something softÂ on her lips.

Isabella opened her eyes. Sebastian had pulled away from her lips and pressed a finger to her lips, his voice hoarse, "Is Richard interesting?"

Isabella blinked.Â 

Hadn't they already got over this topic? Sebastian brought it up again.

"Do you like that type?" Sebastian seemed very concerned about the answer.

Isabella couldn't help but laugh.

Sebastian pinched her chin and asked seriously, "What's so funny? Answer my question. Have you taken a liking to Richard?"

Isabella became curious and said, "What if I have? What would you do?"

Sebastian frowned and thought for a moment, saying, "It would be difficult, but I would try."

"Try what?"

"Try to make him disappear from Lakina."

Sebastian was displeased, even a bit dejected. He said, "So you really like him, just because he has a rare blood type?"

"No." Isabella couldn't bear to tease him anymore. She reached out and hugged his slender waist, pressing her face against his shirt, "I just feel he's a bit different towards my sister. I don't like him."

Sebastian lifted her chin, making her look up at him, "Really?"

Isabella looked into his eyes and sincerely shook her head.

While Isabella was in the bathroom, washing up, Sebastian went to the balcony to make a phone call.

When he returned, Isabella had already taken off her shoes and slipped into the thin blanket on the companion bed.

Sebastian also quickly washed up and then lay down beside her.

The companion bed was small and narrow, which was just enough for the two of them to lie on their sides.

Isabella turned to face him. "Mr. Landon, it must be uncomfortable for you to sleep on such a small bed."

Sebastian reached out and gently stroked her face. "If you know it's uncomfortable for me, shouldn't you give me some compensation?"

Isabella silently looked at him for a moment, then she leaned in and kissed him on the lips.

When she tried to pull away, it was too late. Sebastian clasped her waist, pulling her into his arms, deepening the kiss.

After teasing Isabella for a while, Sebastian finally let her go, but he still held her tightly, his breath spraying on her neck.

The room gradually quieted down. The moonlight outside was hazy, casting a silvery glow.

As Isabella was drifting off to sleep, she heard him call her.

"Bella."

She groggily responded, snuggling into his arms, "What happened?"

Seeing how sleepy she was, Sebastian didn't say anything more. He gently stroked her hair and whispered, "Good night."

###chapter 147  Sweet as Bubbles

Isabella didn't know if she had said goodnight to Sebastian, but after he said goodnight, she fell soundly asleep.

She slept very well.

When she opened her eyes, it was already bright outside the window.

Isabella turned over and found that she was the only one left on the companion bed.

"Bella." Nina's voice came.

Isabella turned her head and saw Nina leaning on the hospital bed, smiling gently at her.

She sat up with a start, "Nina, you're awake?"

Isabella put the quilt into the cabinet, folded the companion bed, and then remembered to ask, "Where's Sebastian?"

Nina said, "He went to the company. The breakfast on the table is what he bought. I've already eaten. You should wash up and eat something."

"Oh." Isabella's face turned red.

While washing up in the bathroom, she sent a message to Sebastian.

Unexpectedly, as soon as her message was sent, Sebastian's call came in.

Isabella answered the phone, "Hello."

"Are you awake, sleepyhead?" Sebastian's deep voice, mixed with a hint of clarity, came through the receiver.

Isabella felt like an electric current ran from her ear straight to her head.

Her cheeks turned flushed. "When did you leave?"

"Just ten minutes ago. Â Do you miss me?"

Sebastian's cheerful tone rose at the end, and Isabella could almost imagine him holding the steering wheel, talking to her while driving, looking ahead with a slight smile on his face.

Although Isabella was too shy to admit it, she did miss him at that moment.

And she couldn't quite control it.

Sebastian chuckled lightly, knowing she was shy, so he didn't tease her further. He said, "Remember to eat breakfast. For lunch..."

"I'll just order takeout for lunch. You focus on work. Don't worry about me." Isabella didn't want to trouble him, and she wasn't a child who needed Sebastian to worry about her meals.

Sebastian respected her. "Okay, make sure to eat well. Don't eat junk food. I'll check the orders tonight."

"Okay." Isabella felt touched inside.

She looked up and saw her reflection in the mirror.

Her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes looked very shy.

Isabella was stunned, never expecting to see such an expression on her face.

Her first love was Matthew, and during their relationship, she felt it was quite sweet.

But compared to now, something seemed missing.

If dating Matthew was like having honey in her mouth, then being with Sebastian was like being immersed in a honey jar. Her whole body, even her soul, felt sweet.

"Shall I hang up?" Sebastian asked.

"Wait." Isabella bit her lip, took a deep breath, and whispered, "I miss you."

Then she heard a sudden screech of brakes and several loud honks from Sebastian's end.

Isabella's heart tightened. "Sebastian, are you okay?"

"Bella, what did you just say? Say it again!" Sebastian's voice was filled with uncontrollable joy.

Isabella found it hard to speak but still repeated, "I miss you."

"Say it again!"

Isabella felt both annoyed and amused. "Are you hard of hearing?"

Sebastian didn't care, half coaxing her, "Bella, I didn't hear it clearly. Can you say it again?"

Isabella bit her lip, unable to look at her reflection in the mirror. "I've already said it twice!"

There was silence for two seconds, and then Sebastian's voice came again. "I'm coming back right now to hear you say it in person!"

"No!" Isabella panicked and quickly compromised.

Saying it over the phone was already overwhelming her.

"I'll say it, okay?" Isabella was really afraid of Sebastian's impulsive actions.

"Okay." Sebastian didn't scare her anymore. "Say it, and I'll listen carefully this time."

Sebastian held his breath.

Isabella lowered her eyes, her another hand squeezing toothpaste.

She squeezed the toothpaste from one end to the other, then back again.

She finally spoke, "I miss you, Sebastian."

"Me, too."

Sebastian was satisfied.

Isabella stayed in the bathroom for forty minutes before coming out.

When she came out, she was flushed and her face was still warm.

She took her breakfast and sat on the stool to eat.

Nina stared at Isabella's face for a long time.

It made Isabella feel very uncomfortable, and Nina finally asked, "Sebastian didn't bully you, right?"

Isabella shook her head. "He's very good."

Upon her saying, Isabella couldn't help but smile.

Nina asked again, "Did you sleep together last night?"

Isabella nodded. "Yeah."

"Did you have sex?"

Isabella's ears turned red. "No, Nina. This is a hospital."

Even if Sebastian was eager to do so, he still knew the limits.

"You're pregnant. Does he know to be careful with sex?" Nina was very worried.

"He knows." Isabella was afraid Nina would misunderstand Sebastian and quickly defended him.

But this was true.

After being together with her, Sebastian indeed had strong desires. The lovemaking process was also quite intense each time, but Sebastian was aware and always careful about Isabella's belly. Despite her belly still being flat and not showing any bulge, he was cautious enough.

Nina looked at Isabella and sighed, "Look at you. Smiling like a fool."

Isabella touched her face. "Really?"

Nina was speechless.

She wanted to get a mirror for Isabella for her smile never faded.

Nina sighed, "I've always said that you are a lucky person."

"Nina, you're lucky too," Isabella said, "You just haven't met the right person."

As Charlie was mentioned, Nina's face turned gloomy.

Nina had just had a miscarriage and was physically traumatized. Isabella didn't want to bring up Charlie's family at this time, so she changed the topic. "Nina, did you always have a rare blood type?"

A complex emotion flashed across Nina's face. "I may not have a princess's life, but I have a princess's blood. With this blood, if something happens, even getting a blood transfusion is a problem."

"Yeah." Thinking of last night, Isabella agreed, "If it weren't for Mr. Cole last night, it would have been really dangerous."

Nina was surprised. "Mr. Cole? Who?"

Isabella was also confused. "Nina, don't you know him? Last night, the hospital's blood bank was in an emergency, and he showed up in time to give you blood. He said his last name was Cole, and the people with him called him Richard."

Nina pictured Richard's face in her mind. "Him!"

###chapter 148 Determined to Divorce

"Do you know him? He seems quite familiar with you."

Nina shook her head.

Seeing Isabella's puzzled look, she then nodded. "I do know him, but not well. Is he also a rare blood type?"

"Yeah. Nina, I remember you used to have type B blood. How did it suddenly become a rare type?"

Nina lowered her eyelids, "I don't really remember."

She rarely got sick and seldom visited the hospital.

For minor illnesses, she wouldn't even check her blood type at the hospital.

If it weren't for this massive bleeding from the miscarriage, Isabella wouldn't have known that Nina had such a rare blood type all along.

As the sisters were talking, the door to the ward opened, and Charlie and Deborah walked in.

Seeing them, Isabella frowned and stood up, blocking them in the front of the bed, "What are you here for?"

"Nina, you're awake." Charlie raised his eyebrows with a hint of joy. "Mom made some soup early this morning, and we brought it over for you."

Deborah smiled broadly as she handed over the insulated container.

Isabella didn't stop them, but she didn't take it either. She looked at Nina. "Nina, are you going to give him another chance this time?"

Last time, the time before that, the current situation were all exactly the same.

Every time Charlie made a mistake, he would act pitiful in front of Nina to seek forgiveness.

Nina was soft-hearted and valued relationships, so she forgave him over and over again.

But this time, Nina almost lost her life.

Isabella thought that Nina wasn't a fool. The sufferingÂ should be enough for her to see the truth.

The room was silent for a few seconds before Nina spoke, "Charlie, let's get a divorce."

"No." Before Charlie could speak, Deborah jumped in. "Nina, couples fight all the time. Don't say things in the heat of the moment."

Nina was very calm. "I'm not saying it in the heat of the moment. I said this last time, but he threatened to jump off a building. I pitied him and gave him another chance for the sake of the child. But now the child is gone!"

"You can always have another child. You're still young. As long as you take care of your body, you won't have trouble conceiving."

Nina replied, "I'm young and can take care of my body. If I try, I can have children in the future."

"That's the spirit!"

"But I don't want to have Charlie's children, nor do I want to have children for your family. If my child takes your surname, they will be trapped in this cage just like me, never able to break free."

Nina couldn't bear to think about it.

If things continued like this, would her child become someone like Charlie or Raymond?

Deborah was dumbfounded.

Nina took a deep breath, placing her hand on her abdomen. "Honestly, now that the child is gone, I feel relieved. Let's get a divorce, Charlie!"

Charlie frowned. "Nina, are you really serious about this?"

"Yes. I've made up my mind."

Charlie nodded. "Alright. But you need to remember thatÂ you won't get anything after the divorce."

Nina said, "Don't worry. I don't want anything."

Charlie sneered, "Fine. Since you've decided, I have nothing more to say. Divorce is big matter. I'll get a lawyer to handle the process to avoid any future entanglements."

"Okay."

With that, Charlie walked out.

Deborah wanted to say more to Nina, but Isabella pushed her out.

"I didn't expect it to go so smoothly!" Isabella said after closing the door.

Nina gave a bitter smile, "Yeah. It was really smooth."

Nina had thought Charlie would cling to her.

Just like last time, when Charlie even threatened to jump off a building.

This time, Charlie surprisingly agreed quickly.

Deborah chased after Charlie all the way to the hospital entrance, grabbing him. "Charlie, what are you thinking? How can you agree to divorce Nina?"

Charlie sneered, "So what if we divorce? Without her, you think I can't live?"

"I didn't mean it. I know you're excellent and won't have trouble finding another woman. But with all the effort you've put into Nina these years, are you just going to let it go to waste?"

Charlie didn't understand. "What do you mean, Mom?"

"I mean, even if you divorce, we can't let Nina benefit from it." Deborah's calculating nature was on full display.

Charlie sneered, "Don't worry. All these years, I've controlled the family finances. Since Nina started preparing for pregnancy, all the money has been with me. She doesn't have a dime."

"Oh, silly boy, that's not what I meant!"

"If not that, then what?"

Deborah clapped her hands, "I mean Isabella!"

Charlie immediately understood and waved off Deborah's idea. "Mom, forget about Isabella and Raymond!"

"Why not? Raymond likes Isabella. Even if you divorce Nina, you must secure Isabella for me!"

Charlie rolled his eyes and said, "Isabella is with Sebastian now. Even if I wanted to do something, I wouldn't dare. Mom, don't worry. Raymond will find a good girl. And after I divorce Nina, I'll bring you a better daughter-in-law. I have to get back to the office now."

With that, Charlie drove off.

Deborah seemed to have more to say, chasing the car for forty feet.

As they left, a black Hummer parked by the roadside lowered its window.

Two people were inside.

Michael, wearing sunglasses, spat, "Richard, can you believe there are such evil people in the world? The mother and the son are both equally vicious."

Richard, sitting in the passenger seat, lazily lifted his eyes. "Isn't that better?"

Michael nodded. "Yeah. The more evil they are, the more blocked their path is. Once Charlie's path is blocked,Â you'll have a chance to get close to Nina, Richard, right?"

As soon as he finished speaking, he got a knock on his head.

Michael clutched his forehead. "Richard, go easy on me."

Richard had already gotten out of the car, slamming the door. "If you say that again, I'll knock your head off!"

"Yes, yes." Michael leaned on the window, speaking in a slick tone, "Next time, I'll call her sister-in-law."

Seeing Richard raise his hand again, Michael quickly retracted his head.

Richard raised an eyebrow. "You follow Charlie and see where he goes."

Michael stuck his head out again, "What about you?"

Richard looked around and said indifferently, "I'll just wander around."

He walked into the inpatient department, and behind him came Michael's voice. "Richard, lying will get you struck by lightning!"

Richard stepped into the elevator, a smile tugging at his face.

'I did have been struck before. But it wasn't by lightning but by a knife!' Richard thought.

###chapter 149  Tough Guy

Isabella saw Richard standing outside when she went to get hot water.

Even though they had met a few times, Isabella was still startled by his gaze.

Richard didn't look scary. In fact, if you looked closely, his features were quite regular. He wasn't particularly handsome but was decently good-looking.

However, he always seemed to carry an aura of menace, and his eyes were intimidating.

Just by standing there, Richard seemed to have a terrible temper!

Normally, if Isabella saw him, she would definitely take a detour.

But last night, Richard had donated blood to Nina. Isabella thought that no matter how fierce Richard appeared, he couldn't be a bad person.

She walked up and greeted him, "Mr. Cole."

Richard nodded gentlemanly. "How is Nina now?"

"My sister is much better now. She's watching TV at the moment." Isabella hesitated for a second and asked, "Would you like to go in and see her?"

Richard glanced at the ward. "Is it convenient?"

"Yes, it is." Isabella nodded.

Richard slightly smiled and pushed the door open to enter the ward.

Seeing the door close, Isabella pondered for a moment and thought she might take a bit longer to fetch the hot water.

Passing by the nurse's station, a young nurse around Isabella's age called out to her, "Isabella, who was that just now? Your brother-in-law?"

Knowing she was misunderstanding, Isabella quickly explained, "No, he's a friend of my sister's."

Although Isabella wasn't sure when Nina had made a friend like Richard, the Richard had stepped up to donate blood for Nina andÂ Nina had said she knew him, which could make him count as a friend of Nina's.

The young nurse looked admiring. "How old is he? Is he single?"

Isabella looked at her. "What do you want to do?"

The young nurse smiled sheepishly, "I saw him standing outside your sister's ward for a long time. I think he's so cool and manly. If it's convenient, could you help me get his contact information?"

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "You like that type? Don't you think he's scary?"

"How can that be called scary? He's just a tough guy!"

Unable to resist the young nurse's enthusiasm, Isabella reluctantly agreed, "I'll ask for you later."

Inside the ward.

As soon as Richard entered, Nina felt the room's light dim a bit.

She was somewhat afraid of Richard.

To be honest, with Richard's look and demeanor, anyone would find him intimidating.

Richard didn't stand on ceremony, walking straight to the bedside, his lowered gaze falling on Nina. "Last night, I thought you were going to die."

After a brief moment of surprise, she laughed.

Richard was really straightforward.

'No one will meet someone and then immediately curse them to die.' Nina thought.

But she didn't seem to mind.

With her laugh, the hostility between Richard's brows dissipated a bit. He casually picked up an apple from the bedside table and sat down.

Nina was about to say there was no fruit knife when she saw him pull out a small sheathed knife from his pocket.

The sheath was beautiful, deep gray with a blue gemstone as an embellishment.

Richard removed the sheath and skillfully twirled the knife between his fingers before holding it steadily in his hand to start peeling the apple.

Richard's series of actions made Nina feel like he was a peacock displaying its feathers.

Realizing this thought wasn't appropriate, Nina couldn't control her ears reddening. She collected her thoughts and said, "Thank you for donating blood to me last night. I didn't expect that you have a rare blood type too."

It was said that people with the same blood type had similar temperaments.

But Nina was kind-hearted and gentle.

No matter what, she didn't seem to be the same type of person as the fierce-looking Richard in front of her.

It was quite surprising that two such different people shared the same rare blood type.

Richard sliced off a piece of apple and brought it to Nina's mouth. "A friend of mine told me this is a kind of bond."

Nina laughed, "Your friend must be quite unreliable. If having the same blood type means a bond, then there are bonds everywhere in this world."

Richard frowned slightly.

Nina felt it was impolite to speak of Richard's friend that way. She took the piece of apple and said, "Actually, it's not entirely unreasonable."

Richard lowered his head and continued peeling the apple, seemingly asking casually, "Ms. Miller, what do you think constitutes a bond?"

Nina thought for a moment and shook her head in confusion. "I don't know."

Once, during her most difficult time, Charlie appeared and brought her a lot of warmth.

At that time, Nina thought she and Charlie were destined for each other.

But now, she realized she was wrong.

She hadn't even figured out her own life, let alone dictate others'.

Richard looked up. "When two people meet again after many years, does that count as a bond?"

Nina nodded. "It should be counted, right?"

Richard smiled and handed her another piece of apple. "Then it's a bond."

Nina was stunned.

Nina felt that his words were directed at her.

"Mr. Cole, have we met before?" Nina asked, "I mean, before coming to Lakina, have we met?"

Richard responded with a question, "Do I look familiar to you?"

Nina shook her head.

No clue at all.

Richard forced a smile. "Then we haven't met."

That counted as an answer.

Isabella lingered in the hot water room for a long time. After getting the hot water, she stayed at the nurse's station for a while.

Finally, she placed the hot water bottle by the door and waited outside for a while before Richard came out.

"Mr. Cole." Isabella stood up straight.

Richard closed the door and nodded at her. "Thank you."

Isabella was taken aback. "Taking care of my sister is my duty."

"Yes." Richard didn't say anything else.

He seemed like incommunicative .

Richard was about to leave.

Isabella remembered Cynthia Young's request and said, "Mr. Cole."

Richard stopped and turned around.

Isabella felt embarrassed. The question turned in her mouth a couple of times before she finally asked, "Are you single?"

Richard looked expressionlessly at the ward and said, "Yes, I'm single."

"Then, is it convenient to leave a contact number?"

"Sure."

Richard's straightforwardness left Isabella feeling incredulous.

She had thought someone as cold as Richard would definitely refuse.

But to her surprise, she easily got his number.

"Anything else?" Richard even thoughtfully asked her, as if he would fulfill any other requests she had.

Isabella shook her head. "No, that's all. Goodbye, Mr. Cole."

"Goodbye." Richard nodded and turned to leave.

Cynthia was ecstatic to get Richard's number.

She hugged Isabella, thanking her profusely.

Isabella returned to the ward and told Nina about it.

Nina laughed after hearing it, "I do think he's not that young anymore. Maybe he doesn't want to date anyone because his intimidating demeanor scares girls away. I know that Cynthia you mentioned. she's a good person."

Thinking of Richard's cold face, Nina felt that someone like him would be better off meeting someone warm and cheerful.

###chapter 150 Maybe Not Be Biological Sisters

Nina didn't give it much thought.

Richard had been waiting all day. The longer he waited, the more frustrated he got.

Even Michael noticed. "Richard, what's up? You've been glued to your phone all day. Did something happen with Nina at the hospital?"

Richard shot him an annoyed look. "You don't know anything!"

Michael grinned. "I've been in eighteen relationships, Richard. Trust me, I know a thing or two. If you need advice, just ask."

Richard scoffed. "Eighteen relationships and got dumped seventeen times?"

Michael was speechless.

After a moment, Richard asked, "If a girl asks you two questions, what does it mean?"

Michael grinned, but Richard's glare wiped it off his face.

Michael got serious. "Depends on the questions."

Richard hesitated. Everyone knew Michael couldn't keep a secret. If he knew, the whole casino would know.

But Richard had been holding it in all day. He finally said, "She asked if I was single and what my phone number is."

Michael got excited. "Nina seems conservative, but I didn't expect her to be so forward!"

Before he could finish, Richard smacked him on the head.

Richard's cold gaze swept over. "Language!"

Michael moved away. "So, did Nina ask you herself?"

"No," Richard paused. "It was Isabella. But I think it was Nina's idea."

Michael nodded. "If she asked those questions, she's interested. Nina's being proactive. What are you waiting for?"

Richard glanced at his phone. "Waiting for her to contact me."

Michael slapped his own head. "Richard, you're usually smart. Why are you clueless about women?"

Richard frowned. "What do you mean?"

Michael tapped the table. "Nina's giving you a chance. You should've stayed and cleared things up. Waiting for her to contact you? Seriously?"

Richard was skeptical. "Is that so?"

Michael said, "Of course! Go to the hospital and find Nina. She'll be happy to see you."

Richard thought about it and felt Michael made sense. After all, men should be proactive in relationships.

But he had no experience and didn't react at the time. He wondered if Nina would be mad now. Thinking about it, Richard got anxious and wished he could fly to Nina.

Just as he stood up, his phone rang. He looked at it, puzzled.

Michael was curious. "What's up?"

Richard smirked. "She messaged me."

Michael asked, "So, still heading to the hospital?"

Richard thought for a moment and shook his head. "Nah, I know her. She's gentle and probably wants to take it slow. I'll just keep in touch for now."

He smiled and started replying to the message.

Michael shook his head.

Later that evening, Zaire and Sebastian showed up at the hospital.

Seeing Zaire, Nina's smile faded. She didn't greet him, just looked away indifferently.

Zaire kept staring at her.

Isabella couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Jose, what are you looking at?"

Zaire smiled. "I heard she's got a rare blood type?"

"Yeah," Isabella said, puzzled. "Why?"

Zaire said, "Don't you know rare blood types are hereditary?"

Isabella was even more confused. "What do you mean?"

Zaire didn't elaborate. He just looked at Nina and asked, "Nina, can I have a word with you?"

Isabella didn't know what Zaire and Nina had to discuss, but she respected Zaire and left the room with Sebastian.

Sebastian brushed Isabella's bangs aside. "You've been in the hospital all day. Aren't you bored?"

Isabella said, "It's okay."

She wanted to eavesdrop but was pulled back by Sebastian. "If you want to know something, just ask me."

Isabella blinked. "Why did Mr. Jose come, and why did he mention the hereditary nature of rare blood types? What does he want with my sister?"

"You have a lot of questions." Sebastian smiled. "Let's take a walk downstairs; I'll answer them one by one."

The park downstairs was beautiful, with lights on at night and many people around the fountain.

Isabella wasn't in the mood to enjoy it; she kept asking Sebastian questions.

Before answering, Sebastian asked her, "Isabella, have you ever felt that you and Nina don't look alike?"

"I don't look like my sister. What's the problem?" Isabella was puzzled.

Sebastian looked at her, a hint of worry in his eyes. "Have you ever thought that you and Nina might not be biological sisters?"

A night breeze blew, carrying water droplets from the fountain, making it feel cool.

Hearing Sebastian's words, Isabella shivered.

"What's wrong?" Sebastian put his arm around her, leading her away from the fountain, protecting her. "Are you cold?"

Isabella shook her head. "What you said gave me goosebumps."

She rubbed her arms, but the sense of loss and fear lingered.

Sebastian led her to a bench, took off his jacket, and draped it over her. He spoke slowly, "You know, Zaire and Kelsey both have rare blood types."

Isabella's eyes widened.

Sebastian held her hand, "Margaret, too."

Isabella blinked, recalling Zaire's words about the hereditary nature of rare blood types.

Her thoughts raced; she began to guess the answer, finding it unbelievable. "Zaire and Kelsey inherited Margaret's rare blood type. Are you saying my sister is the lost daughter of the Jose family, Lisa Jose?"

###chapter 151 I Hug

After saying this, Isabella shivered again. It was absolutely unbelievable! At that moment, she felt like her world was collapsing.

If Nina wasn't her biological sister, then was she an orphan?

Isabella bit her lip and lowered her eyes, trying her best not to let her fear show. But her tightly clenched fingers and trembling body gave her away.

"Bella," Sebastian said, ignoring the crowded park. He picked her up and placed her on his lap. "This is just a guess. Nina's behavior that day was too contradictory, and her age matches up. Now there's also the rare blood type."

Isabella bit her lower lip tightly and finally spoke after a long while. She looked at Sebastian, her eyes full of confusion. "If my sister is Lisa, then who am I?"

When she was a child, she had asked Nina where their parents had gone. Nina would stroke Isabella's head and say their parents were dead.

Then Nina would hug her and pat her back, saying that even without their parents, Nina would always be there for her.

To Isabella, Nina was her only family in the world, the only person she shared blood with! Losing her parents had already made her world dark; now, was she going to lose Nina too?

Seeing Isabella's expression, Sebastian felt heartbroken. He tightened his arms around her. "Whether Nina is Lisa or not, you will always be Isabella. You used to have only Nina, but now you have me and our children."

Isabella sniffled. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't be so emotional."

The news was too sudden; she needed a long time to process it.

Sebastian walked with Isabella around the block; when it was time to return, they headed back.

Just as they reached the hospital entrance, they ran into Zaire.

Isabella's eyes instinctively avoided Zaire.

Sebastian asked, "How did it go?"

Zaire sighed and shook his head. "She denied it and refused to do a test."

He then looked at Isabella. "She is very resistant to me and the entire Jose family. If Isabella could help persuade her, it might work."

Isabella looked up. "Me?"

Zaire said, "Yes! I can tell Nina cares about you."

Isabella was silent. Persuading her wasn't difficult. But she didn't know how to start.

"I know my sister," Isabella said, "She must have her reasons for treating you this way. Can I ask how did Lisa go missing?"

Zaire shook his head. "I don't know much about it either. I just know that all these years, our parents have felt very guilty. Especially my mom; finding Lisa has become an obsession for her."

Sebastian said, "I think Bella is right. You should go back and ask Margaret first. Understand the reason, and then you can address it better."

Zaire hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "Okay."

Because of this matter, both Isabella and Nina had things on their minds.

For the first time, they tacitly agreed not to say or ask anything.

That night, Nina didn't sleep well. Neither did Isabella.

Early the next morning, when Isabella and Nina looked at each other and saw the dark circles under their eyes, they were both stunned.

Nina felt sorry for Isabella. "Bella, if you have something to say, just ask."

Isabella shook her head. "Nina, I'll go get you some hot water to wash your face."

"Bella." Nina wanted to stop her.

However, Isabella ran quickly. Before Nina could say more, she had already run out of the ward.

Isabella didn't want to ask, but she was afraid to. She knew that if she asked, Nina would definitely tell her. However, Isabella was scared.

Lost in thought, Isabella didn't notice when she was getting the hot water, and a large patch of her hand was scalded red. The hot water bottle also fell to the ground.

Fortunately, her feet weren't burned.

Nina got some ointment from the nurse's station and applied it to Isabella's hand, tears streaming down her face.

Seeing her like this, Isabella felt a lump in her throat and said shakily, "Nina."

"Your hand is badly scalded." Nina's voice was also trembling. The more she spoke, the more her tears flowed.

Isabella quickly grabbed some tissues to wipe Nina's tears. However, as she wiped, her own tears started to fall too.

In the end, Isabella and Nina cried together.

When Sebastian returned with breakfast, this was the scene he saw.

Nina quickly wiped away her tears and said to him, "Bella's hand is scalded. Could you..."

Before she could finish, Sebastian had already walked over.

Seeing the burn on Isabella's hand, Sebastian's expression tightened; his eyes showed his distress.

Nina handed him the ointment and went to the bathroom, giving them some space.

Sebastian pulled up a chair and sat beside Isabella, applying the ointment in a somber tone. "I just went out to get breakfast. I could have gotten the hot water. Why were you in such a hurry?"

Isabella sniffled. "I'm fine."

Sebastian looked up at her. "This is fine?"

Isabella said, "It was an accident."

Sebastian frowned. "Steven and Margaret will be here later."

Isabella's eyes widened. "Are they coming to recognize my sister?"

Sebastian knew she was upset. No matter what he said now, it couldn't ease her pain and anxiety. He reached out and hugged her. "Bella, they'll meet your sister whether she is Lisa or not."

Isabella was silent for a long time before nodding heavily.

Isabella hadn't rested well and had things on her mind, looking pale. She barely ate any breakfast, which made Sebastian worry.

Nina also felt sorry for Isabella and said, "Mr. Landon, why don't you take Isabella home for a bath and some rest?"

Isabella looked at Nina anxiously, as if she wanted to say something. But then she remembered that the Jose family would be coming soon; it wouldn't be good for her to be there.

So Isabella swallowed her words.

Sebastian nodded. "That sounds good. We'll come back in the evening and bring you dinner."

"Okay." Nina nodded, still looking worriedly at Isabella. "Mr. Landon, please take good care of Isabella."

Sebastian nodded. "Of course."

As Isabella and Sebastian's car left the hospital, it passed by Zaire's.

Both cars had their windows partially down. Zaire and Sebastian exchanged a silent glance.

Isabella sat in the passenger seat, her eyes downcast, as if she hadn't seen anything.

Sebastian reached out and held Isabella's hand.

The car drove all the way home; by the time they arrived, Isabella had fallen asleep leaning against the seat.

As Sebastian opened the car door and picked her up, Isabella woke up with a start.

"I can walk myself," Isabella said, pushing him.

However, Sebastian didn't let her refuse, wrapping her in his arms and carrying her out of the car.

He looked down at her, his eyes filled with affection. "I'll carry you."

Isabella felt a bit embarrassed but didn't have the energy to argue, so she let him.

Just as they entered the house, they ran into Matthew.

###chapter 152 What Are You Doing?

Matthew's eyes locked onto Isabella, and the pain in them was almost too much to bear.

Since losing his voice, he hadn't uttered a single word. But his eyes still betrayed his feelings for Isabella.

Sebastian narrowed his eyes and stopped. "Can I help you with something?"

Matthew stared at Sebastian for a long moment, then shook his head.

"Don't go out unless you have to. If you hurt someone, I won't tolerate it! This isn't your house." Sebastian's voice was firm. "In my place, you follow my rules. One slip-up, and even if Grandma insists, you're out."

Matthew lowered his eyes and stepped aside without a word.

Sebastian carried Isabella past him.

Upstairs, Sebastian's cold demeanor hadn't faded.

Isabella looked at his stern face and asked, "Are you mad?"

Sebastian placed her on the bed, his tall frame looming over her. "Bella, you're mine now. Keep your distance from Matthew."

His possessiveness was palpable.

Isabella rarely saw this side of him. She was taken aback but nodded. "Okay."

Sebastian's hand caressed her waist, a satisfied look on his face. "You've been so good; don't you deserve a reward?"

In matters of intimacy, Isabella always followed his lead. "What?"

Sebastian smiled and kissed her deeply.

The door was slightly open, and a sliver of light from the hallway shone in. Matthew stood silently at the door, listening. His fists clenched at his sides.

It was unclear how long he stood there before he quietly walked away.

That night, Matthew sat by the window until dawn. As the sun rose, he picked up his phone and dialed a number.

The person on the other end answered cautiously, "Mr. Landon."

Matthew's expression didn't change. "Have her call Sebastian."

here was a hesitation. "Yes."

Isabella was half-asleep when the phone rang. Next to her, the bed shifted as Sebastian went to the balcony to take the call. She turned over and went back to sleep.

"Who is this?" Sebastian answered.

"Mr. Landon, is this Mr. Landon? Help me; please help me. I'm being held captive; I'm about to die. Please save me; save me." The woman's voice was frantic and disjointed.

She kept repeating, "Save me."

Sebastian had a hunch. "Who are you?"

The woman on the other end said, "Samantha, I'm Samantha, Mr. Landon."

Before Samantha could finish, the call was abruptly cut off.

When Sebastian tried to call back, the phone was already off.

He stood on the balcony for a long time, the morning breeze brushing his face. Sebastian gripped his phone, deep in thought.

He dialed Jack. "Look into Samantha."

Jack replied, "Yes, Mr. Landon."

After hanging up, Sebastian returned to the bedroom.

Isabella was still curled up in bed. He lifted the covers and got in. She immediately snuggled up to him, wrapping her arms around his waist and burying her face in his chest.

Sebastian chuckled softly and kissed her forehead.

Jack's call came back quickly. "Since Samantha's miscarriage, she took a long leave from school and went back to her hometown to recuperate. She was originally an orphan, later adopted by the Cook family. After her adoptive parents passed away, she was raised by her brother. It's said her family was very poor, and her brother was harsh on her. When she came to Lakina for college, she couldn't even afford the tuition."

Thinking about the call that morning, Sebastian felt something was off. "Go to her hometown and get the details about her and Matthew."

Jack hesitated. "Do you think Samantha's captivity is connected to Matthew?"

Sebastian didn't answer directly. "Just handle it properly."

Jack replied, "Don't worry, Mr. Landon."

When Isabella woke up, Sebastian was no longer in the bedroom. She washed up and went downstairs for breakfast.

As soon as she entered the dining room, she saw Matthew sitting there, having breakfast.

They exchanged a glance, and Matthew nodded at her.

But Isabella noticed he looked exhausted, especially his bloodshot eyes.

She didn't ask, remembering her promise to Sebastian to keep her distance from Matthew.

A servant brought breakfast. Isabella had just sat down and hadn't taken a bite when Matthew suddenly slid off his chair.

"Matthew?" Isabella stood up in shock and went over to support him.

Matthew's eyes were half-closed, his face pale, and his bloodshot eyes looked even more terrifying.

Isabella felt something was wrong. "I'll call an ambulance."

As soon as she let go, Matthew grabbed her wrist.

He spoke hoarsely, pleading. "Bella, don't go."

Isabella felt the weight on her leg as Matthew leaned against her, weak and frail.

The fact that Matthew could speak surprised Isabella.

"You don't look well," Isabella said, "We should call an ambulance."

Matthew shook his head. "Medicine."

Isabella had spent some time with him at the Landon family and knew he was on medication. However, she didn't know where the medicine was.

Matthew said, "Pocket."

"The medicine is in your pocket?" Isabella knelt down.

Matthew nodded, his eyes completely closed.

Isabella feared he might suddenly die, so she reached into his pocket to get the medicine.

Just as her hand went into Matthew's pocket, Sebastian's cold voice came from behind her. "What are you doing?"

Isabella froze. Before she could react, Sebastian had already walked over, grabbed her arm, and pulled her up without a word.

The force was frightening.

Isabella crashed into Sebastian's chest, while Matthew, losing her support, fell heavily to the ground. He landed face-first.

Whether it was the impact or something else, a few seconds later, blood started to trickle from Matthew's nose.

"Matthew!" Isabella exclaimed, reaching for a tissue to hand to him.

However, as soon as she extended her hand, Sebastian knocked the tissue box to the floor.

The tissue box fell to the ground.

Isabella's wrist went numb; she looked at Sebastian in a daze.

Sebastian also looked down at her, his eyes cold and devoid of any warmth. "Is this what you call keeping your distance from him?"

###chapter 153 He Will Die

Isabella wanted to explain, but when she met Sebastian's gaze, she knew he wouldn't listen.

Sebastian's face darkened even more as she hesitated.

Matthew lay on the floor, coughing up blood, his body convulsing.

The white dining room floor was quickly stained red.

The scene was shocking.

If this continued, Isabella feared Matthew might actually die.

But Sebastian didn't care, not even glancing at Matthew. His eyes were locked on her.

"He'll die!" Isabella said urgently.

Sebastian's face was stone-cold. "Then let him die."

Isabella stared at him, shocked.

Sebastian had always been warm around her, but now there was a coldness in his eyes.

It made her heart tremble.

"If he dies, how will you explain it to Charles and Emma?" she tried to reason.

"No need to explain," Sebastian said coldly. "If he dies here, it's got nothing to do with us."

He grabbed Isabella's arm and led her out of the dining room.

Sebastian really didn't care if Matthew lived or died.

He pressed Isabella onto the sofa, his hands on her shoulders. "Stay here. Don't look at him, don't care about him."

Isabella was stunned. "Sebastian!"

"I have a conference call." With that, Sebastian went upstairs.

Isabella sat on the sofa, feeling like she was on pins and needles.

She hesitated, then took out her phone and called an ambulance. "Hello, I need an ambulance."

After giving the address, they said they'd arrive in twenty minutes.

Isabella sighed in relief.

There was no more movement in the dining room. After a moment, she got up and walked over.

Matthew was still on the floor, having struggled to crawl a bit, leaving a trail of blood.

"Matthew!" Isabella found a bottle of medicine in his pocket.

With trembling hands, she opened it and poured a pill into her palm.

She put the pill into Matthew's mouth.

A moment later, he coughed twice, seeming to catch his breath.

His mouth was full of blood. When he coughed, he swallowed a lot of it.

"I've called an ambulance. They'll be here soon," Isabella said.

"Bella," Matthew managed to say, spitting out blood.

His whole body was shaking; he reached out a hand to her.

Isabella couldn't be as indifferent as Sebastian. After a moment, she took his hand.

Matthew held her hand tightly, a satisfied smile on his lips despite the blood.

It seemed he would be content to die right then.

Isabella's heart tightened. "Matthew, stay awake. The ambulance is coming."

Matthew was shivering. "I'm so cold."

"I'll get you a blanket," Isabella said.

But Matthew held her hand tightly. "Bella, can you hold me?"

Isabella was stunned.

If Sebastian saw that, he'd go ballistic.

Matthew looked so pitiful. "So cold, really cold."

Isabella gritted her teeth. She lifted his head and placed him on her lap.

Just as she did, she felt a chill at the back of her head.

Her heart skipped a beat. She turned around abruptly and saw Sebastian standing at the dining room door, staring at her with a frosty expression.

Isabella opened her mouth to explain.

But Sebastian didn't give her a chance. He turned and left.

Isabella felt a void in her heart, an indescribable discomfort.

The ambulance arrived quickly.

The medical staff lifted Matthew onto a stretcher, finally alerting Zoe.

Seeing Matthew covered in blood, Zoe was terrified. She grabbed Isabella's hand, repeatedly asking what had happened.

Isabella explained while comforting her.

The medical staff asked, "Can a family member come with us to the hospital?"

Zoe hesitated and looked at Isabella.

Isabella said, "Don't worry. I've already notified Emma. They should be here soon."

When she called the ambulance, Isabella had also called Emma to inform her about Matthew's situation.

Almost as soon as she finished speaking, Emma's car arrived.

Emma asked anxiously, "Matthew, how is Matthew?"

"He's already on the ambulance," Isabella said.

"Okay. Thank you, Isabella." Emma thanked her and quickly got on the ambulance.

The ambulance sped away.

Isabella helped Zoe back to her room to rest. Then she changed out of her blood-stained clothes and went to the study.

She hesitated at the door for a long time before raising her hand to knock.

There was no response from inside.

Isabella knocked again and said, "Sebastian, it's me."

Still no response.

Isabella looked at the door in front of her. "Can I come in?" She waited a few seconds. "If you don't say anything, I'll come in."

After saying that, Isabella waited a bit longer.

Seeing no response, she turned the doorknob and pushed the door open.

The study lights were on; there were unfinished documents on the computer.

Isabella looked around but didn't see Sebastian.

She was stunned and quickly walked to the window. She opened it and looked down, only to find that the car in the yard was gone.

Sebastian had left? Isabella felt a wave of disappointment.

She took a deep breath, closed the window, turned off the lights, and left the study. She didn't turn off the computer because of the unfinished documents, just put it to sleep before leaving Sebastian's study.

When she went downstairs, the servants were cleaning up the blood in the dining room.

Isabella walked over and looked at the pool of crimson blood on the floor, frowning slightly.

"What's this?" A servant suddenly picked up a sticky piece of something.

Isabella walked over. "What's wrong?"

The servant said, "Why is there a clot in the blood?"

"A clot?" Isabella was stunned. She put on a glove, took the clot from the servant, and looked at it under the sunlight.

This was the blood Matthew had just coughed up. How could there be a clot?

Human blood is liquid. Even if it coagulates, it shouldn't be this sticky. How long had it been? How could it coagulate so quickly?

Isabella sensed something was wrong. She brought the clot to her nose to smell it but didn't notice anything unusual.

"Ms. Miller, do you still need this?" The servant held a trash can, looking at the clot in her hand.

"No." Isabella threw the glove and the clot into the trash can.

Then she left the dining room and went upstairs.

She didn't go to the study or the master bedroom but went to the guest room where Matthew was staying.

The guest room was simply furnished. When Isabella walked in, she saw a blood bag on the cabinet.

###chapter 154 Does He Really Love You?

It was like someone had put it there on purpose, making sure she wouldn't miss it.

Isabella walked over and picked up the bag of blood plasma.

The plasma was more than half empty, with just a little bit left sloshing around.

Isabella squeezed it casually and found the same clots as downstairs.

So Matthew wasn't coughing up blood; it was this bag of blood plasma?

She had been set up.

Isabella took the half-empty bag and headed to the hospital.

She pushed open the door to the hospital room. Matthew was sitting alone on the bed. His face wasn't as pale as before, but he still looked sickly.

Seeing Isabella, he smiled. "Bella, you're here."

Isabella closed the door and walked over slowly. "You knew I'd come."

Matthew didn't answer her question but said, "Sit."

He took an orange from the bedside table and started peeling it slowly.

Isabella looked at him and asked directly, "You weren't vomiting blood. It was this bag of blood plasma, right?"

Matthew didn't even lift his head. "Yes."

Isabella asked, "You did it on purpose?"

Matthew admitted. "Yes."

Isabella asked, "Why?"

Matthew's fingers paused. After peeling the orange, he started to remove the pith from the segments.

His tone was very calm. "If I said it was to gain your sympathy, would you believe me?"

Isabella said, "No."

Matthew gave a bitter smile. "I knew you wouldn't."

"If it was to gain my sympathy, then you've already achieved your goal. But you deliberately let the blood plasma fall to the ground, making me suspicious, and then led me to your bedroom. You even put the blood plasma in such a conspicuous spot. You wanted me to find it and come to the hospital. Now that I'm here, what do you want?" Isabella asked.

Matthew gave a wry smile. "Bella, you're really smart."

He handed over the cleaned orange segment. "I remember you love oranges but hate the pith. I've cleaned it for you; now you can eat it."

Isabella felt a blockage in her chest. She reached out and knocked the orange segment away. "Matthew, what exactly do you want? Are you trying to drive a wedge between me and Sebastian?"

Matthew looked at the orange on the ground, his heart aching. "Drive a wedge, Bella, do you think Sebastian really loves you?"

Isabella was stunned. She had never thought about it. Or rather, she had never placed the word love between her and Sebastian.

Isabella had always been self-aware. She didn't think that after just a few months of entanglement with Sebastian, there would be any deep feelings.

Isabella always felt that Sebastian's kindness to her was based on sex. She was very clear about this. However, now that Matthew had exposed it, she still felt a bit embarrassed and awkward.

Seeing the sadness in her eyes, Matthew's voice softened. "Bella, I did all this to tell you to stay away from Sebastian. The reason he chose you is because he hates me and my mom."

"No way!" Isabella instinctively retorted.

However, after retorting, she felt a lack of confidence.

She had seen the tension between Sebastian and the Landon family. Although she didn't know the specifics, every time the Landon family was mentioned, a strange hostility would appear in Sebastian's gentle eyes.

Sebastian seemed to hate the Landon family.

Matthew didn't rush to argue but spoke calmly, "Ever since his mom got sick, Sebastian's relationship with Dad went downhill. After she passed away, it got even worse. Then my mom married Dad, I was born, and things really blew up. Since I can remember, he's always ignored us. He went to boarding school and rarely came home. Until that time, on my tenth birthday, he came back. I brought him a cake, and he pushed me away. Later, everyone who ate the cake got food poisoning and ended up in the hospital. He was the only one who didn't eat it."

Isabella was shocked but still instinctively defended Sebastian. "You think Mr. Landon poisoned the cake? He couldn't have done that."

Matthew looked at her, pursed his lips, and said, "It's not a suspicion. Dad checked the surveillance afterward, and Sebastian admitted it. He did poison the cake. Dad was so angry he slapped him, and Sebastian even tried to hit Dad. It was chaos. Dad wanted to call the police, but Mom smoothed things over. After that, he moved out of the Landon family."

Matthew added, "Bella, you say he wouldn't do such a thing because you haven't seen his ruthless side."

Ruthless side.

Isabella's mind flashed back to the morning when Matthew collapsed, spitting blood, and Sebastian said expressionlessly, "Then let him die."

Was that Sebastian's ruthless side?

"Bella, I've known him since we were kids and lived under the same roof. I can't say I know him very well, but I've seen more of him than you have. I did all this to tell you that Sebastian is a ruthless person. His gentleness is just an act. He abandoned Vanessa without hesitation for you. Have you seriously thought about why? Isabella, he chose you to get back at me!"

Isabella suddenly opened her eyes, breathing heavily, her forehead covered in sweat.

It was a dream! She had left Matthew a few hours ago, but his words were still in her mind, lingering.

"Bella?" Nina walked over, leaning down to look at her. "Had a nightmare?"

Isabella nodded and reached out to hold Nina's hand.

Nina sat down beside her, her hand soothingly rubbing Isabella's back. "What kind of nightmare scared you like this?"

Thinking about the content of the dream, Isabella didn't want to say much, so she brushed it off. "Nothing."

Nina looked at her face and sighed. "I know you've always been someone who can't hide things in your heart. Are you overthinking because of my situation?"

Isabella pressed her lips together and finally asked, "Nina, are you really Lisa?"

Isabella didn't have the courage to ask this question before, even avoiding it.

However, what had to be faced, had to be faced. Besides, she wanted to know the truth.

Nina hesitated for a moment, then nodded slowly. "I am."

Seeing Nina's expression, she didn't feel any joy, but rather some resistance.

Isabella asked, "Did you always know you were Lisa?"

Nina gave a bitter smile and shook her head. "It's been so long; how could I remember my name? I only remember the day I was abandoned."

"Abandoned?" Isabella's eyelashes trembled. "Wasn't it that you got separated?"

Nina lowered her eyes, the smile on her lips turning mocking. "Separated was just her excuse. She didn't want me and just left me behind!"

###chapter 155 The Past

"Back in the day, the Jose family wasn't in Lakina; they were in Alvia and not as prominent as they are now. For as long as I can remember, my dad was always away on business, and my mom raised me alone. We had a tough life. Later, my mom got pregnant, and my dad couldn't come back to take care of us. Communication was difficult back then; we mostly relied on letters. My dad's letters came once a month, and my mom would read them over and over, then carefully fold them and place them under her pillow before writing back."

"Life went on like this until one day I came home from school and saw my mom crying. I asked her what was wrong; she said my dad had an accident. That night, my mom didn't sleep at all. The next morning, she said she was worried and wanted to go see my dad. I told her I'd go with her, so she asked me to take time off from school while she waited at home."

"But when I got back, the house was locked. I didn't have a key, so I climbed over the wall and a neighbor told me my mom had sold the house and left."

"I ran to the station after her, but it was too late."

Recalling the past, Nina was in tears. "She left me behind; so even though I know I have parents, I will never look for them. Even if I meet them in a crowd, I will never forgive them!"

Isabella originally wanted to persuade Nina on behalf of the Jose family, but after hearing this, she felt heartbroken.

Margaret abandoned Nina, a seven-year-old child, and sold the house.

Did she ever consider how Nina would survive?

Isabella asked, "How did you end up in Palovia?"

They had grown up in Palovia, relying on each other.

Now it was proven that Nina was Lisa, which meant Isabella was an orphan.

"I wandered in Alvia for a long time, couldn't afford to go to school, and had to beg." Nina gave a bitter smile. "That's how I became a wanderer."

"I was bitten by bugs in the summer and chased by dogs in the winter. I don't even know how I survived those days. The funny thing is, even then, I still held a sliver of hope, thinking they would come back for me. Until that winter when I almost froze to death in the snow, I finally realized in my daze that they didn't want me anymore!"

"After I recovered, I left Alvia. I walked along the highway. I didn't know where I was going; I just knew I wanted to get far away from Alvia and never go back. Before I knew it, I had arrived in Palovia."

Nina turned to her. "I met your parents, Delilah Sullivan and Owen Miller, in Palovia. They took me in."

Isabella's heart trembled, and her eyes welled up with tears. So, she did have parents after all. Isabella wanted to ask something but didn't know where to start.

Nina continued, "At that time, Delilah and Owen ran a small shop. They saw how pitiful I was and took me in. I helped out in their shop, and they treated me very well. Delilah was very pregnant, but Owen's health wasn't good. Not long after, a group of people came, saying Owen owed a huge gambling debt, and they started smashing up the shop without a word."

Nina paused before continuing, "Owen couldn't take it. He collapsed and died on the spot Delilah went into premature labor and was rushed to the hospital. I spent that night waiting outside the operating room."

"The next day, you were born. I held you in my arms, standing by Delilah's bed, and she said to name you Isabella Miller." At this point, Nina suddenly stopped and wiped her tears.

Isabella waited for her to continue, but Nina suddenly changed the subject. "Let's not talk about this, Bella. I should have told you earlier, but the past is full of painful memories. I'll bear them alone. I just want you to grow up happy and joyful."

Isabella grabbed her hand. "What happened after that? You said Dad died and Mom left. So, did she leave after giving birth to me?"

Nina pressed her lips tightly and said nothing.

In her silence, Isabella understood. "She abandoned me like Margaret, didn't she?"

Tears streamed down Isabella's face as she finally felt the pain of being abandoned.

Nina turned and hugged her. "Bella, Delilah might have had her reasons. No matter what, it's all in the past. You still have me. No matter what happens, I will always be with you and never let go of your hand!"

Isabella cried, her heart filled with sorrow, and tears flowed uncontrollably.

Crying and laughing, she hugged Nina tightly, "Thank you, Nina."

The two of them, like branches in the cold winter, leaned on each other, becoming each other's only support.

The Jose Group.

Zaire looked at Sebastian across the table and said, "You've been here for half a day. What's going on? Did you have a fight with Isabella?"

Zaire said, "Isabella is such a good-tempered person. It must be your fault!"

Sebastian finally looked at him with dissatisfaction. "I'm a good-tempered person too. Why don't you say she provoked me?"

Zaire raised an eyebrow. "Isabella provoked you? Would she dare?"

Sebastian frowned and said nothing.

Isabella was indeed soft-hearted and wouldn't dare provoke him.

Sometimes, Isabella even showed fear in her eyes when looking at him.

However, for Matthew, Isabella might dare to do anything!

Zaire poured a glass of juice and placed it in front of Sebastian. "Why can't you just sit down and talk things out? Why do you have to act like a child and come here to hide?"

Sebastian kicked him in the leg. "Who's a child?"

Zaire yelped in pain and laughed. "You are. Do you want me to get you a mirror? Look at yourself. You look like a wronged child."

Sebastian raised his foot again. However, this time, Zaire was prepared and dodged.

Zaire said, "I'm going to find some women. If you want to stay here, go ahead. I'm not keeping you company!"

Sebastian was annoyed. "Where are you going?"

Zaire replied, "Moon Club. Do you want to come with me? I'll get you a couple of beauties. Maybe you'll forget about Isabella once you're having fun. Coming?"

"No!" Sebastian refused without thinking.

Zaire said, "Fine! Stay here then. I'm leaving."

Zaire walked to the door, then stopped and looked back at Sebastian, smiling. "But if you fought because of someone else, staying here is just giving your opponent a chance. A lot can happen in a day."

After saying that, Zaire left.

Sebastian sat quietly for a moment, thinking about Zaire's words, and couldn't stay calm.

He got up and left the Jose Group.

However, just as Sebastian drove away from the Jose Group, Jack called.

Jack said, "Mr. Landon, we've found Samantha. Her situation is worse than we expected."

###chapter 156 Jealousy

Sebastian was driving. "Bring her back."

Jack was quiet for a moment before saying, "It's not that simple, Mr. Landon. Samantha wants to see you. She says it's really important."

Sebastian frowned. "Hand her the phone!"

Jack replied, "She insists on telling you in person."

Sebastian went silent.

Jack added, "She says it's about Ms. Miller."

Sebastian thought for a moment. "Keep an eye on her. I'll be there soon."

"Yes, sir," Jack responded.

Isabella spent the whole day at the hospital.

Sebastian didn't contact her once.

She picked up her phone several times, wanting to text Sebastian, but she couldn't find the words.

"Bella," Nina called out.

Isabella put her phone away and walked over. "Nina, you must be hungry. What do you want to eat? I'll get it for you."

Nina asked, "Hasn't Sebastian been bringing dinner while I've been here?"

Isabella pressed her lips together. Were she and Sebastian having issues? Maybe he wouldn't send dinner tonight.

Nina noticed her mood. "Did you and Sebastian have a fight?"

"Not exactly," Isabella said.

Sebastian didn't argue; he just looked disappointed and left. She didn't even get to explain.

Nina frowned. "Mr. Landon doesn't seem like the type to get mad easily. What happened?"

Isabella was about to answer when the door opened.

Jack had been delivering meals, but today it was Laura.

"Ms. Miller, Mr. Landon asked me to bring this," Laura said, setting down the food and leaving.

Isabella chased after her. "Laura."

Laura turned, still unfriendly. "What do you want? Mr. Landon only asked me to bring dinner. Don't think you can boss me around!"

"You misunderstood," Isabella said. "I just wanted to ask if Mr. Landon is still at the office?"

Laura gave her a strange look. "Mr. Landon hasn't been at the office all day. Didn't you know?"

Isabella was speechless.

After Laura left, Isabella immediately called Sebastian.

She set aside her pride; she was really worried.

But the phone rang a few times and then got hung up.

She called again, but it was still hung up. She stared at her phone, feeling a wave of sadness.

Sebastian wasn't answering.

Was he still mad? Would he ever forgive her?

Isabella didn't call again, but she felt a tightness in her chest, making it hard to breathe.

After dinner, Nina told her to go home.

Isabella lingered for a while but eventually sat down nearby.

Nina looked at her, and Isabella said, "I'm not going back tonight. I'll stay with you."

Nina said, "I don't need you to stay. You're pregnant; it's not good for you to be here too long. I'll worry about you. Go home, be good."

Isabella sat quietly, not moving.

She thought, 'Sebastian won't even answer my calls. I can't bear to go back.'

Even if she did go back, how would she and Sebastian get along?

Not seeing him was already hard enough.

If she saw Sebastian, she was afraid she'd cry the moment she saw him.

At that point, she'd lose all her dignity and pride.

Rather than that, she might as well not go back.

Nina understood what Isabella was thinking and sighed. "Bella, avoiding the problem won't solve it. You have to face it head-on; that's the only way to fix things."

Isabella lowered her head, as if that could shield her from the world's troubles.

But she still couldn't sleep that night.

Maybe it was because the day's events weighed too heavily on her mind. When Isabella closed her eyes, she had strange dreams.

She slept fitfully, finally making it to dawn.

It was still early; Nina was still asleep.

Isabella sat up, put on her coat, and went downstairs to get breakfast.

The hospital was quiet in the early morning. The sky was gray, with the streetlights still on. A gust of wind blew, and Isabella shivered, getting goosebumps.

In the cold mist, she saw a black car driving towards her. It stopped right in front of her.

The car door opened, and Sebastian's familiar figure appeared, breaking through the mist and walking straight to her.

"Why didn't you answer my calls?" Isabella looked at Sebastian, feeling like it wasn't real.

Sebastian saw the dark circles under her eyes, and his anger melted away. He guided her into the car.

The car door closed, shutting out the cold air.

"Are you still mad at me because of Matthew?" Sebastian asked, frowning.

Isabella was stunned. Wasn't Sebastian the one who was angry?

"Is Matthew really that important to you?" Sebastian's chest heaved, and his eyes darkened.

Faced with Sebastian's repeated questions, Isabella felt wronged.

But she wasn't good at arguing, so she avoided his gaze and said, "I couldn't just stand by and do nothing."

If it happened again, Isabella would still make the same choice.

Because she couldn't see someone die in front of her, whether it was Matthew or not.

Sebastian pulled her closer. Isabella stumbled forward, her knee hitting his leg.

Sebastian grabbed her chin and lifted it, making her look into his eyes.

"For Matthew, you're willing to make me angry. Isabella, can you still say you don't care about him?" Sebastian said through gritted teeth.

Isabella clearly cared him a lot!

Sebastian had never been jealous of anyone before. "What's so great about him?"

Isabella was speechless. She didn't know what was so great about Matthew. But Sebastian's anger really scared her.

"Mr. Landon," Isabella said.

Sebastian's eyes flared with anger at her words.

He lowered his head, his gaze lingering on her lips. Afraid she would say something that would hurt his pride, he kissed her.

Sebastian was a good kisser, making Isabella tremble in his arms.

"Bella, call me," Sebastian said, slightly releasing her, his fingers running through her hair.

Isabella called him, "Mr. Landon."

Sebastian lowered his head and kissed her hard. "Call me by my name!"

Isabella couldn't resist and reluctantly complied. "Sebastian Landon."

Sebastian kissed her again, coaxing her. "Not that!"

Isabella's eyes half-opened, seeing his eyes tinged with desire, making her heart tremble. "Sebastian."

"Call me honey!" Sebastian held the back of her head, his nose brushing against hers.

Isabella was stunned. She couldn't say it.

Sebastian stared at her, not wasting any time, and started to unbutton her coat.

Isabella arched her back and tilted her head, exclaiming, "Stop, I'll say it."

Sebastian stopped, his eyes fixed on her.

Isabella felt hot inside. She bit her lip and said, "Honey."

"Yes, I'm here." Sebastian smiled with satisfaction, gently laying her down on the seat and leaning over her.

###chapter 157 I Can't Sleep Alone

Isabella couldn't believe it; she and Sebastian had just made out in the car.

Sebastian did everything but actually go all the way.

Afterward, Sebastian held her close and kissed her ear. "Now can you tell me why you didn't answer my calls."

Isabella's breathing was still uneven. She leaned softly against Sebastian's arm, her voice just as soft. "I didn't. You did."

He flipped the script on her, and he did it so convincingly.

Isabella felt a pang of frustration.

"When did I not answer your calls?" Sebastian looked genuinely puzzled.

Then he remembered and pulled out his phone to check the call log. "Oh, that time. The plane had just taken off, and I had to turn off my phone. Maybe your call came in right when it was disconnected."

"Plane?" Isabella blinked. "Laura said you weren't at the office all day. Were you on a business trip?"

"Not exactly, just handling a small matter." Sebastian's hand brushed her cheek, the anger in his eyes fading a bit. "You ignored my calls just because of this?"

Isabella shook her head. "No."

She pulled out her phone from her pocket. "You never called me."

Isabella unlocked the screen and realized her phone was in airplane mode.

She remembered that she couldn't sleep last night and kept checking her phone. She must have accidentally put it in airplane mode in the middle of the night without noticing.

So, it was all a misunderstanding.

She had been sad and upset all night over this misunderstanding!

Sebastian wrapped one arm around her waist and touched her under-eye area with the other, saying with concern, "Didn't sleep well last night?"

Isabella nodded. "Yeah."

"I didn't sleep well either," Sebastian said, "After meeting that person, I rushed back non-stop."

He took her hand, opened her palm, and pressed it against his cheek. "Look, I'm all worn out."

Isabella glanced at him. "You should go back and rest."

Sebastian rubbed her hand against his face. "I can't sleep alone."

He added, "I've already had Jack send breakfast up to Nina. Shall we go back to sleep?"

Isabella was indeed very tired. Leaning against Sebastian, she felt utterly exhausted and really wanted to rest.

So she nodded. "Okay."

Nina stayed in the hospital for five days.

During this time, no one from the Wilson family came to see her.

However, Steven and Margaret visited a few times, but each time Nina refused to see them.

Margaret had thought about persuading Isabella to help talk to Nina.

However, Isabella refused as well.

Before knowing the truth, Isabella might have said a few words for them.

However, now, besides feeling sorry for Nina, she was also stood by her against a common enemy.

So Isabella only stood by Nina's side; she would never speak for the Jose family!

But she didn't expect that on the day Nina was discharged, Charlie would show up!

When Isabella went downstairs to handle the discharge paperwork, Nina was packing her things in the hospital room.

Hearing the door open, Nina didn't turn around, thinking it was Isabella returning. She smiled and said, "Why so fast?"

Charlie said, "Nina, it's me."

Hearing this voice, Nina stiffened.

When she turned around and saw Charlie, her expression turned cold. "Are you here to take me to get a divorce?"

Charlie took two steps forward and hugged her from behind. "Nina, let's not go through with the divorce, okay?"

Nina was stunned and sneered. "We already agreed on this. Why are you backtracking now, Charlie? Do you really think I can't live without you?"

"No!" Charlie held her tightly. "It's me who can't live without you. Nina, I was confused before, I was out of my mind, and I said those hurtful things. Don't take them to heart. I came here today specifically to take you home. I've already asked Mom to make lunch; she will apologize to you."

Nina broke free from him, turned around, and looked at him coldly. "Charlie, I won't forgive you this time!"

"Nina."

Suddenly, the door to the hospital room was kicked open with a loud noise, startling Charlie.

Nina was also startled. When she saw Richard walking in, she even held her breath for a moment.

"You again?" Charlie's gaze lingered on Richard for a few seconds before turning back to Nina. He questioned, "Nina, who is he?"

"Who he is has nothing to do with you," Nina said, then ignored Charlie and continued packing her things.

"Nina." Charlie approach her again.

Suddenly, a cold gaze swept over him. Charlie looked at Richard and saw that he was holding a finely crafted short knife, slowly stroking the blade.

The knife looked sharp. An ordinary person would handle it with extra care.

However, Richard was stroking the blade with his palm. He didn't seem to fear cutting himself and getting blood everywhere.

Richard slightly lifted his eyelids, his gaze landing directly on Charlie's face.

Meeting his eyes, Charlie instantly felt very small. Charlie knew who Richard was.

Although he had never met Richard in person before, the stories about Richard in the top casino were enough to make anyone shudder.

Now seeing Richard in person, Charlie felt even more that this was not someone he could afford to offend.

At that moment, Charlie froze in place.

Until Richard impatiently frowned and threw a cold glance at him, Richard's thin lips parted, and he slowly uttered two words, "Get out!"

Charlie snapped back to reality, shuddered uncontrollably, and hurriedly left.

Nina turned her head when she heard this.

Richard was stunned and quickly hid the hand holding the knife behind his back.

However, his fierce expression hadn't yet softened; he met Nina's gaze directly.

Their eyes locked for a few seconds.

Richard tugged at his lips, trying to force a smile. Little did he know, his expression looked even fiercer.

Nina glanced at him and quickly looked away, continuing to pack her things.

Richard watched her back and helplessly moved his cheeks a bit.

Isabella finished the discharge paperwork and saw Charlie's figure as she passed by the pedestrian walkway.

Charlie was on the phone, completely unaware that Isabella was approaching.

Isabella stood by the door, listening to his conversation.

"Oh, come on, don't be mad. I did what you said and tried to win her back, but she's so heartless. What can I do? I really tried to win her back. You don't know Nina; when she says it's over, it's over."

"I don't get it. You're with me because you like me, right? Now that I'm getting a divorce, you can be my legal wife. Why are you still urging me to reconcile with her?"

"Fine, whatever you say. I'll try harder, okay? If I manage to reconcile, you better reward me. Darling, I can't wait to pin you down and make love to you."

After that, Charlie's words became too filthy to listen to.

Isabella frowned and quietly walked away.

###chapter 158 Stepping in Front of Him

Isabella burst into the hospital room. "Nina!"

Her voice cut off abruptly because she saw Richard had Nina pinned down on the bed.

When Isabella pushed the door open, both Richard and Nina turned to look at her.

Isabella's mind went blank for a few seconds. "Mr. Cole?"

Richard stood up, pulling Nina with him.

He calmly dusted off his clothes while Nina's face turned crimson with embarrassment. She walked over and pulled Isabella aside. "Be careful; you're pregnant. Did you hurt your stomach?"

Isabella shook her head, still in a daze. Looking at Nina's flushed face, she didn't ask more questions and got straight to the point. "I just ran into Charlie downstairs!"

Nina nodded. "He came to see me."

Isabella asked, "Did he come to ask for a reconciliation?"

Nina was taken aback. "How did you know?"

"I overheard him talking about it on the phone downstairs." Isabella grabbed her hand, her expression serious. "From what I heard, it seems like he has someone else!"

The earlier part of Charlie's conversation could be ignored, but the flirtatious remarks at the end confirmed that Charlie had another woman.

Nina was stunned, and a few images suddenly flashed through her mind. She covered her mouth, feeling nauseous.

"Nina, what's wrong?" Isabella asked nervously.

"Nothing." Nina took a moment to compose herself.

A bottle of water was handed over from the side.

Nina and Isabella both turned to look at Richard, who was offering the water.

"Drink some water to calm down," he said.

"Thank you." Nina took the water and realized the cap was already loosened, making it easy to open.

Nina took a couple of sips, suppressing the nausea, and said, "I suddenly remembered that a few times before, I smelled women's perfume on him."

Nina glanced at Richard, her eyes flickering. "I also found some other things in his bag."

Nina had suspected before, but Charlie's smooth talking had dispelled her doubts.

Although Isabella had only overheard a few phone calls and nothing was confirmed, Nina was now almost certain.

Charlie was definitely capable of such a thing!

Isabella asked, "So what now?"

Nina took a deep breath and calmly said, "Divorce."

Richard, standing nearby, said, "If you can get evidence of Charlie's infidelity, it could help with the division of assets..."

Nina shook her head. "He bought the house. I've contributed a lot over the years; but now, I don't want to pursue it anymore."

All she wanted now was a clean break, nothing else.

Isabella worriedly said, "But from what I heard, he still wants to win you back. I don't know what his intentions are, but it can't be anything good. Nina, you need to be careful."

"Yes." Nina nodded. "I've learned my lesson. I forgave him last time for the sake of the child. Now that the child is gone; don't worry. I won't be soft-hearted again."

"Good." Isabella felt a bit relieved.

Nina then remembered to ask Richard, "Mr. Cole, why did you come today?"

Richard glanced at Nina and said, "It's nothing."

Richard was a mysterious person. Nina owed him a favor and didn't know how to repay it, but she subconsciously felt he wasn't a good person and didn't want to know more about him.

So when Richard said it was nothing, Nina didn't press further.

Sebastian's car was parked downstairs. Isabella and Nina got in and left.

Richard stood there for a while, then took out a cigarette and lit it.

After a while, Michael drove up. "Richard."

Richard nodded, opened the car door, and got in.

As soon as he got in, Michael eagerly asked, "Did you tell Nina about Charlie's affair? How did she react?"

Richard paused and then said, "I didn't tell her."

"You didn't?" Michael was confused. "Why not?"

Richard replied, "She already knows."

"Really? How did she react? Is she going to tear Charlie apart?" Michael was excited, looking forward to the scene.

Richard glanced at him and said, "She didn't react much. She just wants a divorce."

Michael shook his head. "Nina has such a good temper."

Richard smiled, noncommittal.

Yes, Nina had a good temper. So good that she had no temper at all.

If it were him, he would have taken half of Charlie's life!

Michael continued, "Having a good temper is a good thing. Richard, you have a bad temper, so you need to find a woman with a good temper. Only then can you have a harmonious life together."

Richard turned to look out the window, the scenery outside flashing by. In his eternally lonely eyes, a small spark seemed to ignite.

Nina was now in the process of divorcing Charlie, so she couldn't go back to her house.

When they arrived, Sebastian had already told Isabella to invite Nina to stay with them.

However, Nina said she didn't want to disturb them. She had rented a warehouse for work before; it was still available.

Nina had the driver take her to the warehouse, where she tidied up and settled in.

Previously, Nina had stopped her business to prepare for pregnancy, but she still had some inventory left.

With nothing else to do, Nina started organizing and went to work that night.

She sold handmade crafts and little trinkets that girls liked, so she wasn't worried about selling them, even if it meant losing half the price.

However, Nina didn't care about that. She just wanted to sell the items quickly and get some money in hand.

Isabella wanted to stay with Nina, but Sebastian came to pick her up after work, saying he had something important to discuss.

Nina said she didn't need company. So Isabella left.

Isabella thought Sebastian was taking her home; but half an hour later, they arrived at the police station.

Isabella asked in confusion, "Why are we here?"

Sebastian held her hand and led her inside.

As soon as they entered, they saw Charles and Emma standing in the lobby, looking anxious.

Isabella opened her mouth to greet them; but before she could, Charles walked over quickly and raised his hand to slap Sebastian.

"Seb!" Isabella exclaimed, grabbing Sebastian's arm and stepping in front of him.

Charles's slap struck Isabella's cheek hard.

Isabella felt a sharp shock on her cheek. The force was so strong that she didn't feel the pain immediately, and her hair was disheveled.

No one expected Isabella to step in, including Sebastian.

He looked down at Isabella, his eyes filled with emotion.

Emma rushed over and grabbed Charles's arm, saying, "Charles, calm down. Let's talk this out."

She then turned to Isabella. "Bella, are you okay?"

However, before she could touch Isabella, Sebastian pushed her away. "Don't touch her!"

###chapter 159 Does It Still Hurt?

Sebastian cradled Isabella, watching her face and ear swell up, his heart aching.

He shot a cold glare at Charles. "After all these years, you haven't changed. But guess what? I'm not a pushover anymore. I'll pay Matthew back double for this slap!"

"How dare you!" Charles fumed, eyes blazing. "Matthew's your brother, you heartless beast! You sent him to prison. Are you even human?"

Sebastian sneered. "Who's the real monster here? You can hit me, but I can't hit back?"

Charles's face turned crimson with rage. He clutched his chest, staggering back a few steps, wincing in pain.

"Charles, are you okay?" Emma rushed to his side, helping him to a seat. She fumbled in her bag, pulled out a white pill bottle, and gave him two pills.

She gave him some water, soothing his chest and comforting him.

Meanwhile, Sebastian led Isabella to a bench away from the commotion.

Sebastian gently touched her face, his expression dark. "I won't forget this slap."

Isabella saw that cold glint in Sebastian's eyes again, her heart skipped a beat. She grabbed his hand. "Sebastian, why are Charles and Emma here? What did Charles mean by sending to prison?"

"If I told you I sent Matthew to prison, would you hate me?" Sebastian asked, looking at her.

Isabella was even more confused. "You sent Matthew to prison, why?"

Was it just because Matthew staged that scene with fake blood that morning?

Though she was angry, it didn't seem enough to send Matthew to prison, right?

Before Sebastian could answer, the door on the other side opened.

Isabella looked up and saw a girl as thin as a skeleton.

At first, she didn't recognize her.

Until the girl looked over, and their eyes met. Isabella was shocked to realize it was Samantha!

"Samantha!" Isabella called out.

It had been two months since they last saw each other.

Now, Samantha looked nothing like she used to.

Samantha used to be ordinary-looking, but at least she looked human.

Now, she was so thin she was unrecognizable. Her cheekbones were deeply sunken, her eye sockets hollow; even her eyes had lost their luster.

It seemed like she had been tortured.

Isabella suddenly remembered what Leo said last time about Samantha calling him for help.

Samantha might have been undergoing severe torture at that time.

Isabella couldn't imagine what kind of torture could turn a healthy person like Samantha into this in just two months.

Samantha's gaze lingered on Isabella's face for only a second before she looked away. Her sunken eyes seemed a bit abnormal.

Emma had already walked up, choking on her sobs. "Samantha, I know Matthew wronged you; the Landon family wronged you. We shouldn't even have the face to ask for your forgiveness, but now Matthew is also sick, very sick. He can't go to jail. I'm begging you; please forgive him, okay? We can give you whatever you want."

Samantha looked at Emma with fear and unfamiliarity in her eyes, but she remained silent.

When Emma pulled her urgently, she retracted her hand. Her whole body was filled with resistance.

As they were tangled up, another door swung open.

Matthew walked out with a couple of officers.

One of the officers said, "Matthew has confessed. He admitted to bribing Samantha's brother to imprison and torture her."

Emma, who had been pleading nonstop, suddenly let go of Samantha's hand. She stared at Matthew in shock, tears running down her cheeks.

Charles's eyes turned red, but he had to accept the truth.

This could've been handled privately.

But Sebastian had taken legal action from the start. Now, even if the Landon family wanted to settle it with money, it was too late.

With Matthew's full confession, even though the Landon family spent a fortune, they couldn't avoid his one-year prison sentence.

Samantha's brother, as an accomplice and the direct perpetrator, was also sentenced to a year.

On the day of the trial, Samantha was sent to a psychiatric hospital. She had already lost her sanity.

On the day of the sentencing, Emma fainted on the spot. Charles, in front of all the media in Lakina, announced he was cutting all ties with Sebastian.

Isabella never expected things to get this bad. She hadn't slept well for several nights, waking up in the middle of the night to find the bed empty.

The study light stayed on all night. Sebastian would only come back to bed at dawn, lying down beside her.

Isabella turned over and hugged him.

Sebastian stiffened; when he met Isabella's gaze, he felt embarrassed.

He lowered his head, burying his face in her neck, and asked, "Bella, am I wrong?"

Isabella shook her head, speaking softly, "You didn't do anything wrong. If it were me, I would have done the same."

Looking at the whole situation, Samantha was the victim. Matthew's actions towards her were unimaginable.

Sebastian's actions might seem ruthless to the Landon family, but to Samantha, they were a salvation.

"Really?"

Isabella hugged him tighter, "Yes."

Sebastian held her for a while, then let go, his fingers gently caressing Isabella's cheek, "Does it still hurt?"

Isabella was momentarily stunned, realizing he was talking about the slap from Charles.

She shook her head, "It's been so many days, it doesn't hurt anymore."

Seeing his sad expression, Isabella added, "Actually, it didn't hurt much even when it happened. Charles didn't hit that hard."

Sebastian pulled her into his arms again, "Isabella, did you know? You're the first person to stand up for me."

Isabella's heart ached.

Sebastian was a man, and not just any man, but the head of the Landon Group. Before joining the Landon Group, she had heard many impressive rumors about Sebastian.

A man like Sebastian, Isabella always thought he was incredibly strong.

But at this moment, he was showing her his softest side.

Isabella reached out to touch Sebastian's cheek, her tone like coaxing a child, "Mr. Landon, don't be afraid. I'll protect you."

Sebastian chuckled, catching her hand and pressing it to his lips, then holding it tightly in his palm, "You said it, no backing out."

Isabella shook her head, "No backing out."

Sebastian then leaned down to kiss her.

###chapter 160 You're All I Have Left

They snuggled in bed for a bit before getting up to wash up.

While Sebastian was in the bathroom, Isabella headed to the walk-in closet to change. When it was her turn, Sebastian came over and hugged her from behind, his hand gently caressing her belly. "Seems like it's grown a bit more."

"Almost five months now," Isabella replied.

"Time flies," Sebastian said, lowering his eyes to hide his emotions.

This whole mess had completely severed Sebastian's ties with the Landon family.

Even if Matthew got out of prison someday, Charles probably wouldn't forgive Sebastian.

Isabella saw a hint of desolation in Sebastian.

Maybe because he wasn't loved by his parents growing up, Sebastian always had this aura of isolation and loneliness.

It made Isabella's heart ache.

She slowed down her brushing, suddenly wanting to tell Sebastian about the baby.

But Nina and Matthew's words echoed in her ears.

"I'm afraid he's not sincere."

"Do you think he really loves you?"

"He chose you just to get back at me."

Isabella pursed her lips, spat out the foam, and asked, "Sebastian, why did you choose me?"

Sebastian stroked her hair, thinking for a moment before saying, "I don't know."

Isabella was speechless.

Don't know? What kind of answer was that?

She wanted to ask more, but just then Sebastian's phone rang.

He let go of her waist and went out to take the call.

Isabella looked at herself in the mirror, the urge to confess already fading.

Sebastian went to the study to handle some online documents, so Isabella went downstairs first.

Breakfast was already set on the table.

As soon as Isabella walked in, she saw Zoe sitting alone at the table, staring at the food but not eating.

"Mrs. Landon, what's wrong?" Isabella walked over and noticed tears in Zoe's eyes.

Though Zoe was old, she always had a childlike heart. Maybe because she'd been through so much in her youth, she had a peaceful mindset and a sense of acceptance with time.

But today, her expression was different.

Zoe looked at Isabella, blinking back her tears. "How long are you going to keep this from me?"

Isabella's heart skipped a beat.

No one had told Zoe about Matthew, and Sebastian had intended to keep it from her.

But Zoe had found out anyway.

Isabella lowered her eyes, not daring to meet Zoe's gaze.

Zoe sighed. "For so many years, Sebastian has refused to forgive Charles. I know Sebastian holds a grudge, but I didn't expect him to be so ruthless as to personally send Matthew to prison."

Isabella thought carefully before speaking, "Mrs. Landon, this was Matthew's fault."

Zoe looked at her. "Matthew was wrong; but Bella, can you say this had nothing to do with you?"

Isabella was speechless. No matter what, Sebastian's ruthlessness was partly because of her. She couldn't deny it.

Zoe shook her head in disappointment. "Now that Sebastian has completely severed ties with the Landon family, I can't stay here any longer."

She stood up as a driver walked in from the door. "Mrs. Landon, the luggage is all packed. When would you like to leave?"

Zoe waved her hand. "Let's go."

"Mrs. Landon." Isabella stepped forward and grabbed Zoe's hand. "Where are you going?"

Zoe glanced at her, her eyes filled with complex emotions. "It's not convenient for me to stay here. I'll move back to my village. You can have your peace, and I can have mine."

She brushed off Isabella's hand and walked out.

Isabella hesitated for a moment before following her.

As they left the dining room, they saw Sebastian standing outside. It was unclear how long he'd been there, but he didn't ask anything. He just said to Zoe, "I'll take you home."

"No need." Zoe didn't look at Sebastian and walked past him.

"Mrs. Landon." Isabella wanted to stop her but was held back by Sebastian.

Soon, the sound of a car driving away could be heard outside.

Isabella anxiously said, "How could you let Mrs. Landon leave?"

Sebastian smiled bitterly. "I know Grandma best. Once she decides something, no one can change her mind."

He paused and then hugged Isabella. "Isabella, you're all I have left."

Time flew by; two days passed.

During these two days, Isabella successfully attended her graduation ceremony.

Sebastian accompanied her and moved all her things from the dormitory back home.

As they were leaving, Patricia clung to Isabella, wiping away tears. Isabella comforted Patricia, saying she was staying in Lakina and would visit often.

Nina continued to live in the warehouse, selling things at night and looking for work during the day. Without a degree and being older, she couldn't find any decent jobs.

Nina wasn't afraid of hard work. She secretly found a job as a janitor at Moon Club.

She worked at Moon Club during the day and continued selling things at night.

This way, her monthly income was quite decent.

However, the divorce was still being dragged out by Charlie. As long as the divorce wasn't finalized, Nina couldn't feel at ease.

Isabella went to work at the Landon Group and avoided Kelsey whenever she saw her.

However, no matter how much she avoided her, Kelsey eventually cornered her at the water cooler.

Kelsey, hands on her hips, angrily asked, "Isabella, why do you run away when you see me?"

Isabella avoided her gaze. "I don't."

"I know!" Kelsey said, "It's because of Nina, right? That's why you're ignoring me?"

Isabella remained silent.

Kelsey sighed and walked over. "Mom told me everything. Actually, Mom had her reasons. Dad's business was in trouble, and she had to sell the house to help him. She planned to return after giving him the money, but she fainted. At the hospital, she found out she was pregnant. Dad was busy with his business, so Mom had to stay to take care of him..."

Isabella interrupted her, "No matter how hard it was, she shouldn't have abandoned a seven-year-old child! If you were the one abandoned, you wouldn't be saying this so easily. Did you ever think she might die?"

Kelsey was choked up, her eyes turning red. "If it were me, I'd hate her too. I wouldn't forgive her either. But..."

"Ms. Jose," Isabella interrupted again, "You shouldn't be telling me this. You should be telling my sister!"

Isabella tried to leave, but Kelsey grabbed her. "Can you take me to see her tonight? I'll tell her myself."

Isabella pulled her hand back. "Sorry, I can't."

She couldn't bring the Jose family to Nina. She wouldn't allow them to hurt Nina again.

"Isabella." Kelsey stomped her foot and chased after her.

However, as soon as she stepped out, she bumped into Jack.

They exchanged a glance, and before Jack could speak, Kelsey rolled her eyes and walked away.

Jack was speechless.

###chapter 161 Peaceful Years

Isabella refused, but Kelsey still snuck off to see Nina a few times. Isabella had no clue.

Now, Isabella and Sebastian were practically glued together, commuting to and from work every day. Sebastian didn't want to overload her with work, so he only gave her light tasks, worried she'd get bored.

As the months rolled by, Isabella's belly grew, and she felt heavier. Winter made her even sleepier, as she needed naps two or three times a day in addition to going to bed early.

Watching the snow outside, Isabella felt like her life was a dream.

Her phone rang-it was Miley. After Miley's miscarriage, she left Moon Club. Zaire bought her a villa and she's been living there since.

Isabella and Miley were in frequent contact. Miley was prepping for exams and always joked about how she was more well-behaved now.

Miley's dream was to be a teacher, something she couldn't afford before. Now, with a rich guy backing her, she was determined to make it happen.

Isabella admired Miley's guts. She knew what she wanted and went for it without hesitation.

They had just chatted last night, and Isabella knew Miley had her last exam today. Miley was probably calling to unwind.

Isabella picked up, and Miley's excited voice burst through. "Isabella, I finished my exams! I wasn't even this excited about getting into college. Walking out of that exam hall felt amazing!"

Isabella listened quietly. When Miley finished, she said, "Now all we need to do is to wait for the results in a few months."

"Yeah," Miley said, "Got plans tonight? Wanna hang out?"

Isabella hesitated. "I need to ask Sebastian first."

"Of course," Miley laughed. "Gotta check with Mr. Landon; you belong to him now."

Isabella blushed at the tease.

Sebastian came back shortly after. He dropped some documents on the table and wrapped an arm around her waist, glancing out the window. "Watching the snow?"

"Yeah," Isabella said, smoothing a wrinkle on his sleeve, her eyes soft.

She had a natural gentleness that made time feel like it was slowing down.

Sebastian kissed her and said, "Zaire called. There's a gathering tonight. Wanna go meet some friends?"

Isabella thought of Miley's call. "Mr. Jose?"

Sebastian nodded. "Yeah."

Miley would probably be there too. Zaire was helping her out now, and from what Miley said, they were pretty into each other.

Maybe Zaire was throwing the party to celebrate Miley?

Isabella nodded. "I'll message Miley back."

Sebastian patted her head lovingly.

As Isabella texted Miley, Jack knocked and walked in. "Mr. Landon, you wanted to see me?"

Sebastian got to the point. "Got plans tonight?"

Jack nodded. "Nope."

Sebastian said, "Mr. Jose has a gathering at Moon Club tonight and specifically asked for you."

Since Jack and Kelsey had their falling out, Zaire wasn't too fond of Jack either. Jack figured Zaire's invite probably wasn't for anything good.

But Sebastian was his boss, and Zaire likely assumed Jack wouldn't refuse if Sebastian asked him.

After a pause, Jack said, "Mr. Landon, I need to be with my fiancÃ©e tonight."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow and, remembering Zaire's instructions, said, "It's a private gathering. You can bring Nancy along. She doesn't have many friends here, so she might enjoy it. But if she's busy, then forget it."

Jack thought about Nancy's complaints from yesterday and said, "Alright. I'll ask her."

Back in his office, Jack called Nancy.

"Hey, Jack." Nancy's side was noisy, with music playing.

Jack paused. "Where are you?"

"Just wandering around," she said, moving to a quieter spot. "Why are you calling? What's up?"

Jack asked, "Are you free tonight? I want to take you to dinner."

Nancy hesitated. "I ran into an old classmate, and we planned to have dinner tonight."

Jack frowned. "Alright, have dinner with your classmate. Text me your location when you're done. I'll pick you up."

Nancy said, "Okay, thanks."

After hanging up, Jack was lost in thought, but a colleague interrupted with some documents.

When Jack finished his work, he got a notification of a large withdrawal from his account. His additional card had been used to spend $20,000 within the last ten seconds.

Since Nancy moved to Lakina, Jack had given her his additional card. Small expenses didn't notify him, but large ones did.

Nancy liked expensive clothes, bags, and jewelry, but she usually pestered him to buy them together. This time was different.

Jack logged into his mobile banking to check the details. The spending was at a high-end store.

He called the store and found out Nancy had bought a dress and a pair of shoes for $20,000.

Though Jack had doubts, he didn't ask much. Girls loved shopping, and he felt he owed her.

Unexpectedly, the store was diligent. They added his contact and sent an electronic receipt, showing the dress and shoes with prices.

The dress was a low-cut, off-shoulder style. The shoes were crystal high heels, sparkling with a 5-inch heel. Not Nancy's usual style.

The store also sent a voice message, "Mr. Brown, if you have any doubts, do you need us to recover the money or report it to the police?"

Jack thought for a moment and said, "No, thank you."

Winter nights in Lakina were dry and cold. The lights at the entrance of Moon Club were dazzling.

When Isabella got out of the car, a gust of wind made her shiver. Sebastian quickly wrapped her in a warm embrace.

Sebastian asked, "Cold?"

Isabella looked up at him. "A little."

As they were about to enter, a voice suddenly called out, "Seb!"

###chapter 162 So Young

Isabella turned and saw two women stepping out of the car behind her.

One wore a red dress with dramatic makeup. The other, in a black dress, had an elegant simplicity, but her every move exuded a noble presence that others couldn't imitate.

Behind them was Leo, dressed in a suit.

The three walked over. Leo's gaze briefly swept across Isabella's face. When their eyes met, Leo gave a slight nod.

The woman in the black dress greeted Sebastian first. "Sebastian, long time no see."

The woman in the red dress looked at Isabella, sizing her up before her gaze fell on Isabella's slightly rounded stomach. "I've heard Sebastian has a girlfriend, but I didn't expect her to be so young."

Isabella felt a bit at a loss.

Sebastian squeezed her shoulder and said, "This is Susan Anderson."

Before he could say more, the woman in the black dress extended her hand to Isabella. "Hi, I'm Emily Lopez."

Isabella instinctively felt that Emily was easier to get along with than Susan, so she politely shook her hand. "Hi, I'm Isabella."

Emily gave her a gentle smile full of warmth.

At that moment, another car drove up. It was Zaire's Phantom.

After the car stopped, Zaire got out. He seemed casual, but Isabella felt he was more tense and restrained than usual.

Zaire said, "Everyone's here so early? I thought I'd be the first."

Susan's smile softened as she walked up and hugged Zaire.

Zaire stiffened; any remaining casualness vanished instantly.

Susan turned her head slightly, her red lips seemingly brushing against his white collar. "Long time no see, Zaire."

The sound of a camera shutter clicked.

Everyone turned to see Leo taking pictures with his phone.

Leo smiled. "A moment of reunion, capturing a memory for you all."

Susan had already let go and stepped back a couple of steps, creating a slight distance between her and Zaire. But her carefully made-up eyes still stared at him with a faint smile. "You haven't changed much from how I remember."

Zaire scratched his head awkwardly and even blushed a bit. "You've changed."

"I know. I've gotten uglier," Susan said with a smile.

Zaire was taken aback, smiled, but said nothing more.

A waiter took the keys from him to park the car.

Isabella then realized that Miley hadn't come with Zaire.

Isabella, though timid, wasn't foolish. The ambiguous glances between Zaire and Susan were obvious to anyone.

Isabella quietly sent a message to Miley: [Where are you?]

Miley replied quickly: [Moon Club. Did Mr. Landon let you come?]

Isabella sat in the corner, reading the message, and instinctively looked at Zaire on the opposite sofa.

What a coincidence! Miley was also at Moon Club?

Was it a coincidence? Or did Zaire have other plans?

Isabella continued to text: [Where should we meet?]

Miley: [Room V12.]

Isabella's eyelashes fluttered.

They were currently in Room V11.

Isabella looked at Zaire again, her eyes filled with confusion.

It seemed like Zaire had arranged this on purpose.

Zaire was talking to Susan about her life abroad. Noticing Isabella's gaze, Zaire turned his head.

Their eyes met. Zaire jokingly complained to Sebastian, "Am I looking extra handsome today? Why does Mimosa keep staring at me?"

Sebastian glanced at him, handed a peeled orange slice to Isabella, and said, "Relax, Bella has high standards. She wouldn't be interested in someone like you. Even dressed up, you're still the same underneath."

Zaire was both amused and annoyed. "Alright, alright. Do you want me to spill your secrets?"

Sebastian looked up, giving him a cold stare.

Zaire immediately realized he had misspoken and quickly glanced at Isabella.

Before Isabella could ponder over the words, Susan spoke up, "Mimosa?"

Zaire quickly explained, "Isabella is shy; her ears turn red when she speaks, so I nicknamed her Mimosa."

Susan gave him a playful look. "Zaire, after all these years, you still love giving people nicknames? By the way, why isn't Kelsey here today?"

Zaire said, "She had something to do and couldn't make it."

Isabella turned to look at Sebastian.

He was focused on cleaning the orange pith, seemingly not paying attention to their conversation.

About seven minutes later, Jack arrived. He came alone.

After greeting everyone, he sat down nearby.

Just a few minutes later, Miley texted that she had arrived.

Isabella was about to get up to check when she heard a crisp knock on the door.

Zaire smiled. "Let me introduce someone special."

Saying this, he got up to open the door.

Isabella thought it must be Miley at the door.

Although she didn't know why Zaire arranged this, Isabella guessed it had something to do with Susan.

Zaire opened the door; all eyes in the room turned to the entrance.

"Mr. Jose." Before seeing the person, the voice came through.

Isabella immediately recognized who it was and looked at Jack in surprise. He was pursing his lips, staring gloomily at the door.

It was hard to tell if he was surprised or not.

However, his expression was definitely not good.

"Come in," Zaire said, slightly stepping aside.

Then, a red figure flashed in.

"So many people." When her gaze fell on Jack in the corner, Nancy's expression froze.

It seemed she hadn't expected him to be there; her eyes showed visible panic.

However, Nancy just clenched her dress and lowered her eyes.

She didn't seem to want to greet Jack.

It was as if she wanted to pretend not to know him.

Zaire put his arm around Nancy's shoulder. Since she was wearing an off-shoulder dress, Zaire's hand touched her skin directly.

Nancy didn't push him away, letting him hold her.

Susan's eyes narrowed, but she maintained her smile and asked, "Zaire, who is this?"

Zaire didn't rush to introduce her but looked down at Nancy. "Do you want to introduce yourself?"

Nancy raised her head, first looking at Zaire for approval and encouragement. Then she raised her head fully and said, "Hello everyone, I'm Nancy Shaw, a friend of Mr. Jose."

She hesitated slightly before saying the word "friend."

With Zaire's hand on her shoulder, it was easy to guess their relationship.

###chapter 163 He's Playing You

Susan looked like she wanted to say something but held back.

Emily broke the silence. "Ms. Shaw, come sit with us."

With Zaire's nod, Nancy lifted her long skirt and took a seat.

Jack's eyes never left Nancy.

But she didn't glance his way even once.

Isabella was clueless about what was happening. She quietly pinched Sebastian's fingers.

Sebastian leaned in and whispered, "Zaire's setting this up to reveal Nancy's true colors to Jack."

Isabella scanned the room.

Nancy was already chatting with Emily and the others. Zaire handed her a drink.

Nancy's eyes flickered as she said softly, "Mr. Jose, I don't drink."

Zaire raised an eyebrow. "When you're out having fun, not drinking isn't an option. Drink up, and we'll all be friends."

Nancy hesitated.

Jack suddenly stood up.

Startled, Nancy quickly took the glass and downed it in one gulp.

Whether she drank too fast or on purpose, some of the drink trickled from the corner of her mouth, down her chest, and disappeared into her cleavage.

Zaire's eyes shamelessly followed the drop.

Jack felt a surge of anger. He couldn't hold it in any longer. He stepped forward, grabbed Nancy's hand, and started pulling her out.

Zaire didn't stop him; he let go just in time.

He'd done his part; now it was up to Jack.

Nancy was caught off guard as Jack yanked her up and dragged her toward the door. A few seconds later, she realized what was happening and tried to pull her hand back, unwilling to leave with Jack.

The room fell silent as everyone watched Jack and Nancy struggle.

Leo, bored, took out his phone and started filming.

Isabella shot him a look.

Leo smiled and quietly put his phone away.

"Let go of me! Let go!" Nancy struggled.

Unable to break free, she used her long nails to scratch the back of Jack's hand, leaving marks.

Jack turned to her, his eyes tinged with red. "Can't you see? He's playing you!"

Nancy was stunned, feeling a mix of embarrassment and shame. But she still said, "I don't care!"

"You don't care?" Jack's face turned pale with anger. "I didn't bring you to Lakina for you to degrade yourself. If that's what you want, I'd rather you go back!"

"I'm not going back!" Nancy's voice was sharp. "If you can't make it, why can't I find another way out?"

Jack looked at her coldly. "What did you say?"

Things had already gone too far tonight. Nancy probably knew there was no going back with Jack. She said, "Jack, you're just an employee for the Landon Group. You have to answer to others. What can you give me?"

Maybe Jack's gaze was too intense, so Nancy looked away, her chest heaving. "I don't want to live like you. I want to be rich!"

Jack was silent for a few seconds, then laughed. "So you're willing to degrade yourself. Don't you realize why he invited you tonight? It was all for me to see!"

"I told you; I don't care!" Nancy's eyes were red. "I'm willing to pay the price, even if it's my dignity!"

Jack looked at her like she was crazy, his eyes full of incomprehension.

Maybe he had underestimated Nancy's ambition, or maybe he had never truly understood her.

Nancy tried to pull her hand back, but Jack held on tightly.

Helpless, she looked at him. "What do you want?"

Jack said, "Come back with me. I'll call your parents. If they support you in this, then I have nothing more to say."

Nancy shouted, "I'm not going back. Let go, Jack!"

No matter how much Nancy struggled, Jack still dragged her to the door.

He opened the door and came face to face with someone outside.

Miley was about to enter the V12 room when she ran into Kelsey.

After a brief conversation, Miley learned that Zaire had organized a gathering next door.

Kelsey, thinking Miley was invited by Zaire, enthusiastically brought her along.

However, before Kelsey could reach for the door, it opened from the inside.

Jack, pulling Nancy, paused for a second when he saw Kelsey, a look of embarrassment flashing in his eyes. However, he quickly looked away and continued dragging Nancy out.

Kelsey stood at the door, stunned.

Miley, seeing the situation inside the room, smirked and walked in.

Isabella stood up. "Miley."

Miley smiled at Isabella, a knowing look on her face. "Looks like we ran into each other?"

The situation was complicated. Isabella didn't know how to explain it. Besides, with so many people around, it wasn't the right time to speak.

After greeting Isabella, Miley turned to Zaire. Of course, she didn't miss the two new faces.

"Mr. Jose, you have a get-together and didn't invite me. Are you treating me like an outsider?" Miley walked over and sat next to Zaire.

Zaire couldn't muster a smile. He glanced at her without much emotion and asked, "Why are you here?"

"I had plans with Isabella." Miley put down her bag and coat, leaning closer to him. "I booked V12. Mr. Jose and I are really in sync, even booking rooms next to each other."

Zaire looked at her. Miley's makeup was light, and she was dressed conservatively. Compared to the glamorous Susan, she was lacking a bit.

He reached out, stroked Miley's back, and with a playful smile, said, "If I had known, I would have invited you."

Miley laughed. "I should have changed my clothes. That way, I wouldn't embarrass you."

Zaire raised an eyebrow. "You're not embarrassing."

Their eyes were filled with flirtation.

Next to them, Susan picked up a glass of wine and downed it.

Emily pulled her aside and whispered, "Don't drink too much."

Zaire glanced at Susan out of the corner of his eye, lowered his gaze, rubbed his thumb on his knee, and his lips tightened slightly.

No one asked about Miley, and Zaire didn't introduce her, creating a tacit understanding.

Kelsey walked in and greeted old friends. "Susan, Emily."

"Kelsey." Susan pulled her over. "Long time no see. You've grown so much. I remember you're the same age as Leo, right?"

Kelsey said, "He's two years older than me."

"Really?" Susan slapped her forehead. "I must have remembered wrong."

Zaire turned to Kelsey. "I thought you weren't coming."

Kelsey's eyes flickered. She glanced at Isabella and then looked away. "I'm here to see a friend."

"Do you have friends at Moon Club? What kind of friends?" Zaire squinted, worried Kelsey might be led astray.

Just as Kelsey was about to speak, the door opened, and several waiters brought in food.

Among the waiters, Isabella saw Nina.

###chapter 164 Be Careful of Emily

Nina saw Isabella and was taken aback.

Their eyes met for just a second before Nina quickly looked down.

After delivering the food, Nina left with the others.

Isabella couldn't stay calm. She turned to Sebastian and said, "I'm going out for a bit."

"Want me to come with you?" Sebastian asked.

Isabella shook her head.

Nina was waiting for Isabella outside.

Seeing her come out, Nina pulled Isabella into the staff passage.

Once they were alone, Isabella finally asked, "Nina, is this the new job you mentioned?"

"Yeah." Nina avoided eye contact. "Bella, I don't have many skills. I'm just glad they hired me. I thought I'd make some money first and figure out the rest later."

Isabella took her hand. "Why didn't you tell me?"

"I didn't want you to worry," Nina said.

"Not telling me doesn't mean I won't worry." Isabella looked at Nina, her eyes full of concern.

"I'm fine; don't worry about me." Nina was more concerned about her. "Is Sebastian treating you well? Why did he bring you here? You're pregnant; you can't drink alcohol!"

"I didn't." Isabella shook her head. "He's very good to me. When are you and Charlie getting divorced?"

"Soon," Nina said vaguely, "We're already going through the procedures."

Isabella was puzzled. "You don't want anything; what procedures do you need?"

Nina's face turned a bit grim; she revealed the truth. "He's afraid I hid money and insists on having the assets checked before he'll talk about the divorce."

Isabella said angrily, "That's too much! They're being unreasonable!"

"Yeah." Nina gave a bitter smile. "But what can I do? Fortunately, I have nothing, so once everything is checked, he won't have any excuses."

Isabella frowned, but she had a feeling things might not be that simple.

Nina had to work, so they didn't talk much before parting ways.

As Isabella exited the staff passage, she saw Leo smoking by the window.

"Isabella." He stubbed out his cigarette, waved away the lingering smoke, and walked over. "Can I have a word with you?"

Isabella glanced at the private room and nodded. "Sure."

Leo had something on his mind.

Isabella sensed it from the first moment she saw him that evening.

"I went to see Samantha." It seemed like Leo had been holding this in for a long time before he finally said it.

Thinking of Samantha, Isabella felt a bit of pity. "How is she?"

Leo shook his head. "Not well."

Isabella asked, "Is it serious?"

"Yeah." Leo felt a bit guilty. "If I had gone, maybe I could have saved her, and she wouldn't have ended up like this."

For him to feel so guilty about this, Leo must be a really kind person.

Isabella said, "This isn't your fault. In the end, no one expected Matthew to be so ruthless."

Sebastian had said that Samantha had asked him to fly over, saying she had something important to tell him in person.

At that time, Samantha should have been clear-headed.

She told Sebastian she didn't dare return to Lakina because Matthew had warned her that if she dared to come back, he would kill her!

Even though she hated Matthew after her miscarriage, Samantha didn't want to lose the Landon family's support.

It was just a child; she was still young and could have more.

That day, Emma arranged for her and Matthew to dine alone. Samantha had planned to make Matthew happy, but who would've thought he'd pick up a dinner knife and cut his own throat?

It was later blamed on Samantha. But in reality, Matthew cut himself!

Because of this, the Landon family sent Samantha back to her hometown.

Matthew had already bribed Samantha's siblings to confine and abuse her.

This happened a month ago, but every time Isabella thought about it, she still had nightmares.

She couldn't believe Matthew could be so ruthless and decisive.

Ruthless to Samantha. Even more ruthless to himself!

Sebastian brought Samantha back to Lakina; when the plane landed, she was still normal.

Somehow, after arriving at the police station, Samantha lost her mind.

Isabella thought it might be because she saw Matthew and was traumatized.

In the end, Samantha was also a pitiful person.

Leo said, "I'm going to see her tomorrow. Do you have time to come with me?"

He didn't say it outright, but the meaning was clear. Maybe he felt deeply guilty when he was alone with Samantha?

Isabella thought for a moment and nodded. "Okay."

Leo seemed to sigh in relief. He glanced at her belly and asked, "Are you and Sebastian planning to get married?"

Isabella was taken aback and shook her head. "No."

Leo asked, "Then he is?"

Isabella said, "He helped me pay off eighty thousand dollars of debt. Now I owe him."

"So you're just paying him back?" Leo was a bit surprised. "I've known him longer than you. I think he's serious."

Isabella didn't want to discuss this topic, so she said, "It's getting windy and a bit cold. Let's go back to the room."

"Okay." Leo nodded, walking alongside her at a leisurely pace.

When they reached the door of the private room, Isabella reached out to open it.

Leo suddenly called her softly, "Isabella."

"Hmm?" Isabella turned back.

A complex expression flashed in his eyes, and after a moment of hesitation, he finally said, "Be careful of Emily."

Isabella was about to ask what he meant by that.

The door to the private room opened, and Sebastian stood inside, his gaze sweeping over her and Leo. "I was just about to look for you."

He took Isabella's hand. "What took you so long?"

Isabella brushed it off. "Just getting some fresh air outside."

Except for Isabella, everyone else had drunk a bit.

Isabella was drinking juice; there were only fruits in front of her.

After a few rounds of drinks, the atmosphere in the room became a bit heavy.

Isabella looked around and saw that everyone seemed to have something on their mind.

The one who drank the most was Susan.

She suddenly stood up and pointed at Miley. "Miss Harper, shall we have a drink?"

Miley was also a bit tipsy, but she had worked in nightclubs and had built up her tolerance. She was quietly resting on the side when Susan called her out, and she wasn't one to back down. "Sure."

Drunk Susan was even more flamboyant. She opened ten bottles of alcohol, poured herself three glasses, and drank them all. "Your turn, Miss Harper."

Miley sneered lightly. "Using glasses is boring."

She reached for a bottle. "Let's drink straight from the bottle."

Susan was stunned for a moment, seemingly not expecting Miley to be so bold.

Hesitating, Susan looked at Zaire.

Zaire didn't look at her, leaning back on the sofa, legs crossed, fingers playing with a glass.

Seeing this, Susan felt a little sad. Without another word, she raised the bottle and started drinking.

Miley raised an eyebrow and followed suit, drinking unhurriedly.

###chapter 165 I Want a Kiss

After three bottles, it was clear Susan was done for.

Clang! The bottle hit thetable hard, and Susan swayed, almost losing her balance.

Emily grabbed her arm. "Susan, stop drinking."

"I'm fine!" Susan shrugged her off. "It's not every day I get along so well with Miss Harper. Gotta drink up, right, Miss Harper?"

Compared to Susan, Miley was still sober.

She'd had one more bottle than Susan, but her face was just a bit flushed, and her eyes were still clear.

Miley smiled. "Of course. When you drink, you go all out."

Miley and Susan exchanged a glance and kept drinking.

Emily couldn't take it anymore and turned to Zaire. "Can you say something?"

Zaire raised an eyebrow. "Miley."

That one word made both Miley and Susan freeze.

Miley paused, then put down her bottle. "Sorry, Miss Anderson. Mr. Jose is strict; he doesn't let me drink, so I won't."

She walked back to Zaire's side.

Zaire stood up, wrapped his arm around her waist, and held her close. "You've had enough; let's go home."

Miley leaned against him and pouted. "I want a kiss."

Zaire hesitated, then kissed her on the lips.

As he was about to pull away, Miley wrapped her arms around his neck, stood on tiptoe, and kissed him passionately in front of everyone.

Susan stared in shock.

The bottle in her hand fell to the ground, shattering.

"Susan." Emily pulled her to sit down.

Susan lowered her head, no longer flamboyant and carefree, now shrouded in a faint aura of melancholy.

Isabella watched in astonishment, thinking Miley was incredible!

Was Miley reacting to Susan's earlier taunt?

This comeback was really strong.

"Sorry," Zaire said, "We're leaving now."

After they left, Isabella and Sebastian also left.

As soon as they stepped out, they heard Susan's wailing from the private room.

Isabella looked up at Sebastian. "Anderson and Zaire..."

Sebastian said, "They used to date."

Isabella paused, then asked, "What about you and Emily?"

The atmosphere in the elevator became tense.

Sebastian frowned. "There's nothing between us now."

Isabella didn't ask further.

Sebastian's answer was evasive.

She had asked if he and Emily had ever dated.

Sebastian said there was nothing between them now.

Indeed, there was nothing now; just like Zaire and Susan, no matter how passionate it was, it's all in the past.

However, the scary part wasn't that it was over, but that the past still hung around in their heart.

Judging by Zaire's behavior tonight, he definitely hadn't let go of Susan.

Although Sebastian seemed calm, Isabella felt it wasn't that simple.

However, since he didn't want to say more, Isabella didn't want to ask further.

After all, she was nothing.

Even if there was something between Sebastian and Emily, even if they rekindled their relationship, Isabella would just have to pack up and make way for Emily.

Her shoulder felt heavy as Sebastian pulled her closer.

His voice came from above her head. "Did Leo say something to you?"

Isabella shook her head. "No."

He ruffled her hair. "Don't overthink."

Isabella nodded. "Okay."

As they went downstairs and walked out the door, they saw Zaire's car driving past them. The windows were closed, so they couldn't see inside.

Inside the car, Miley and Zaire were passionately kissing, nearly undressed.

Zaire pinched her chin. "You did well tonight."

Miley smiled and straddled his lap. "Mr. Jose, is that Miss Anderson the ex-girlfriend you can't get over?"

"Can't get over?" Zaire sneered, but it was self-mocking. "To me, there are only women who listen and women who don't. Miley, you are a woman who listens."

Miley caressed his cheek. "So Miss Anderson didn't listen to you?"

Zaire's hand roamed her leg. "Smart girl."

Miley leaned closer. "I helped you so much tonight; how will you reward me?"

"What's the rush? Let me enjoy you first." Zaire placed her on the seat and leaned in to kiss her.

In the heat of the moment, Miley pushed him away and took out a condom from her bag. "Put this on."

Ever since that miscarriage, Miley always made Zaire take precautions.

She didn't want to suffer the same pain again!

The next morning, Isabella heard the doorbell as soon as she went downstairs.

She opened the door and saw Jack standing outside.

He was holding a briefcase, looking tired, with bloodshot eyes. His voice was rough. "I'm here to pick up Mr. Landon."

Sebastian was busy with work. Isabella never asked much about it. She stepped aside. "Come in first."

Jack shook his head. "No, I'll wait outside."

Thinking about last night, Isabella asked, "You and Nancy..."

Jack lowered his eyes, his tone emotionless. "We broke up."

Isabella wanted to say something comforting but felt that in such matters, no amount of comfort from others would help. In time, it would be forgotten.

After breakfast, Sebastian kissed Isabella. "I have a business trip to Maple Valley for a few days. I can't take you with me since you're pregnant."

Isabella asked, "So sudden?"

Although he was usually busy, it was the first time he left so abruptly.

Sebastian didn't say more. He just hugged her. "Stay safe at home and wait for me to come back."

Isabella nodded. "Okay."

Isabella had just put the dishes in the dishwasher when Leo arrived.

He was there to take her to the psychiatric hospital.

Isabella changed her shoes and left with him.

At the psychiatric hospital, they met Samantha.

Samantha was holding a stuffed doll, her head down, avoiding eye contact. She sat quietly, muttering something unintelligible. Occasionally, she would scratch her head or pick at her nails.

Fortunately, she was well taken care of and looked clean and tidy.

Leo's phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID, signaled to Isabella, and went out to take the call.

Isabella nodded and watched Leo leave. When she turned back, she found Samantha had raised her head, no longer staring at her toes but directly at Isabella.

Isabella was startled by Samantha's gaze. "Samantha?"

Samantha laughed. However, it was just a silly laugh.

Although she was laughing, her eyes were lifeless.

Samantha's expression, combined with her laughter, was quite eerie.

Just as Isabella was about to say something, Samantha suddenly stood up and rushed over.

###chapter 166 Cutting the Tongue

Her stance was downright terrifying, like some twisted, crawling dark creature that had reached Isabella.

Samantha leaned in close, her breath hot on Isabella's face.

Samantha hissed, her expression almost feral. She gripped Isabella's arms tightly, eyes wide. It seemed like she wanted to say something but couldn't.

After a moment of spine-chilling fear, Isabella realized something was wrong.

She reached out and pried open Samantha's mouth.

Isabella's eyes widened as if an electric current had passed through her body. She sat straight, feeling her entire body go numb and unable to move.

Just then, Leo walked in.

Seeing the situation, he was stunned for a moment, then stepped forward to pull Samantha away. He turned back to Isabella and asked, "Are you okay?"

Isabella couldn't answer; she pointed at Samantha and said, "Her tongue!"

"Tongue?" Leo looked at Samantha in confusion.

Samantha's tongue had been cut off!

They asked the staff at the psychiatric hospital; they said Samantha was like that when she was brought in.

Samantha was taken to a ward and given a sedative; she calmed down.

At this moment, even if they wanted to ask her anything, they couldn't.

Isabella stood in the sunlight but felt a chill all over her body.

Leo walked up behind her and said something she didn't catch.

Isabella felt a wave of dizziness and fainted the next second.

When she woke up, she was in a hospital.

The smell of disinfectant in the hospital was something Isabella had always feared.

However, at this moment, it inexplicably made her feel at ease.

"You're awake?" Leo sat by her bed, a hint of worry in his eyes.

Isabella propped herself up on her arms. "How's Samantha..."

"I just called to check. They said she was traumatized and she's still not herself," Leo said, "I've been there twice; each time she just cowered and didn't react at all."

Isabella thought for a moment.

Earlier, when both she and Leo were there, Samantha had also kept her head down and remained silent.

Samantha's emotional outburst happened after Leo left.

Isabella vividly remembered Samantha's expression at that time. She felt that Samantha was clear-headed then and wanted to say something to her.

Unfortunately, she was too scared at the time and missed the opportunity.

Sebastian said that Samantha was afraid to return to Lakina and insisted that Sebastian go there before she was willing to say those things to him in person.

After that, Sebastian brought Samantha back; she even gave a statement at the police station, which meant that Samantha still had her tongue at that time.

She was later diagnosed with a mental disorder and sent to a psychiatric hospital for treatment.

When Isabella saw Samantha again, Samantha had no tongue.

Who did it? The Landon family? Or Sebastian?

Several people flashed through Isabella's mind, but she couldn't grasp the key point.

"We still need to ask Samantha to find out." Isabella felt like a heavy weight was pressing on her chest, making it hard to breathe.

Leo nodded. "I'll ask. You should stay here. You're pregnant; if anything happens, Sebastian will will never forgive me."

Isabella was fine and stayed in the hospital for a while before Leo took her home.

In the car, Leo told her, "By the way, since what happened with Matthew, Charles has been going after the Landon Group. From what I know, he's already sabotaged several important deals for Sebastian. This time, Sebastian had to fly to Maple Valley on short notice because he had no other choice."

He shook his head, saying, "In some ways, Sebastian and Charles are really quite similar!"

Isabella silently sank into her thoughts.

Leo glanced at her. "You okay?"

Isabella nodded her head.

Leo dropped her off at home but still felt uneasy. "Are you really okay?"

"I'm fine." Isabella smiled and got out of the car.

She had walked a few steps when Leo rolled down the window and said, "If you need anything, just call me."

Isabella waved and went inside.

Leo stayed in the car for a few minutes, looking at the villa with a complex and worried expression.

After a long while, he finally drove away.

In the afternoon, Isabella leaned back in her chair and had a video call with Sebastian.

"It's already past mealtime. Why are you eating now?" Isabella asked with concern.

Sebastian fixed the phone to capture his upper body. "I just finished work."

Thinking about what Leo had said about Charles targeting Sebastian, Isabella felt a bit worried. "No matter how busy you are, you still need to eat on time."

Sebastian said, "I know."

They chatted for a bit.

Isabella suddenly said, "I went to the psychiatric hospital this morning."

Sebastian frowned. "Why did you go there?"

"I went to see Samantha," Isabella admitted.

She hadn't planned to hide this from Sebastian and wanted to see his reaction.

Sebastian's frown deepened. "Why would you want a lunatic? Don't go back there."

Isabella remained silent and didn't respond.

Sebastian sensed something was wrong and asked, "What's the matter?"

Isabella suddenly said, "Sebastian, Samantha's tongue was cut off."

In the video, Sebastian's hand holding the fork paused for a few seconds.

Then Sebastian put down the fork, pushed the lunch box aside, and picked up the phone. "Bella, whatever happens to Samantha has nothing to do with you anymore. Be good and don't go see her again!"

Sebastian's eyes looked at her through the phone.

After a long time, Isabella finally responded, "Okay."

Sebastian said, "Alright, I have to get back to work. I'll call you later."

"Okay." Isabella leaned back in her chair, lost in thought.

She was really afraid that Sebastian was involved in this.

Unconsciously, she slowly fell asleep.

The scene changed; she arrived at the Landon family.

It was quiet all around, not a sound to be heard.

She walked into the Landon family and heard noises coming from the kitchen.

When Isabella walked over, she saw a familiar figure. "Sebastian?"

Sebastian didn't seem to hear her and continued to focus on what he was doing.

Isabella's gaze shifted to his hands.

Sebastian was making a cake.

A small birthday cake was already taking shape, and he was decorating it.

Sebastian's skills were more proficient than Isabella had imagined; the flowers he piped were layered and beautiful.

Just as he finished everything, Sebastian threw away what he was holding and took out a packet of powder from his pocket.

He mixed the powder with cocoa powder and sprinkled it on the cake.

Isabella suddenly realized what it was. "No!"

She reached out to stop him.

However, the scene suddenly changed.

The cake was placed on the table; Matthew put on a birthday hat while everyone sang "Happy Birthday."

"Let's cut the cake."

Matthew cut the first piece of cake and handed it to Sebastian. "Thanks for making the cake, Sebastian. I love it. The first piece is for you."

###chapter 167 Trap

Sebastian took the cake without a word but didn't eat a bite.

The others dug in, especially Matthew, who devoured more than half.

Soon, Matthew's face twisted in pain; the cake plate slipped from his hand, and he clutched his stomach, squatting down in agony.

The ambulance arrived. Charles, Emma, and Matthew were all loaded in one by one.

The ambulance sped off, sirens blaring.

Once the sound of the ambulance faded, everything went eerily quiet again.

Isabella turned and saw Sebastian standing in the shadows, his face cold, a faint, indifferent smile on his lips.

Isabella jolted awake from the nightmare, drenched in cold sweat.

It was already dark; she had slept for hours.

The wind had started to pick up.

Isabella grabbed her phone and saw several missed calls from Nina.

She went back inside, closed the balcony door, and called Nina back.

The phone rang for a long time before someone answered.

"Nina," Isabella said.

A familiar, greasy voice came from the other end. "Bella, it's me."

Isabella froze, a chill running through her. "Charlie?"

Charlie laughed. Isabella could picture his disgusting face.

"Where's Nina?" she demanded. "Give her the phone!"

"Looking for Nina?" Charlie's voice was slow and mocking. "She's asleep. If it's not urgent, I'll have her call you back when she wakes up."

Nina's asleep?

Isabella glanced outside; it was just getting dark, the sunset still faintly visible.

Nina would never go to bed this early; she had been busy selling things lately!

Plus, Nina was in the middle of a divorce with Charlie; she wouldn't be with him!

Isabella started to panic. "Charlie, what did you do to my sister?"

Charlie replied, "Bella, I'm her husband; what could I possibly do to her?"

"Where are you?" Isabella asked.

"At home, where else?" Charlie said.

Isabella hung up, grabbed her car keys, and headed straight for the Wilsons' house.

Before getting out of the car, she took a small knife from the glove compartment and held it tightly.

Deborah opened the door. "Bella, what brings you here?"

Isabella gripped the knife tightly and eyed Deborah warily. "I'm here to see my sister."

"Nina's in the bedroom." Deborah stepped aside. "Come in."

Deborah even got her some shoes.

As Isabella changed her shoes, Deborah closed the door.

"Why are you closing the door?" Isabella stood up and moved to open it.

Deborah grabbed her. "Bella, you hardly ever come by. Come in and sit down."

Isabella snapped, "Don't touch me!"

"Alright, alright!" Deborah raised her hands, startled. "I won't touch you. Don't get excited; be careful."

Isabella glared at Deborah and went to open the door.

At that moment, a hand grabbed Isabella's arm, and a cloth with a strange smell was pressed over her nose and mouth.

The pungent smell overwhelmed her. Isabella's mind went blank, and her body went limp.

In a daze, she heard Deborah's voice. "Hurry, get her to the bed! Your brother is right; once it's done, Isabella will have no choice but to accept it!"

Then, Isabella felt someone tugging at her clothes.

Isabella tried to fight back, but her limbs were weak and unresponsive. In her panic, she blacked out completely.

She didn't know how long she had been unconscious when she woke up.

She heard Nina's sobbing voice. "Bella." She fell into a warm embrace.

Isabella was momentarily stunned. Although she was awake, the sense of weakness still lingered. Her head felt heavy and painful.

She tried to rub her temples, but when she raised her hand, she realized her clothes had been removed. She was only covered by a thin blanket. She froze.

Nina hugged her tighter. "Bella, don't be afraid; I'm here."

Isabella's mind finally cleared. She looked around and realized she was in the guest room of Nina's house.

It used to be her room, then Raymond's.

What happened after she passed out was obvious.

The door was tightly closed; there were sounds outside.

Suddenly, someone burst through the door. Isabella saw several police officers, as well as Zaire and Leo outside.

The door was kicked open by Raymond, who was holding a knife, disheveled, and waving it around. "Stay back, all of you, stay back!"

Deborah screamed in terror.

Charlie said, "Raymond, put the knife down; don't hurt yourself!"

Raymond fell to his knees, crying loudly, "Charlie, I really love Isabella. I will treat her well. Just give me a chance!"

"Yes, give him a chance!" Deborah echoed, running to the door and looking at Nina. "Nina, after all, this is a family matter. Since things have come to this, and Isabella is a girl, can you give Raymond a chance?"

Nina put Isabella down and walked over.

Deborah smiled ingratiatingly at her.

The next second, Nina raised her hand and slapped Deborah hard.

Deborah yelped and fell to the ground.

Before she could cry out, Nina grabbed something from a nearby cabinet and started hitting Deborah with all her might.

"Are you even human? You beast!" Nina, like a madwoman, smashed the stone-carved ashtray onto Deborah's head and body repeatedly.

The room was filled with dull thuds; within a minute, Deborah was bleeding from her head, lying unconscious on the floor.

The police officers in the living room reacted and rushed over to stop her.

They called an ambulance and sent Deborah to the hospital.

Then the police took Raymond and Charlie back to the station.

The station needed someone, so Zaire went along.

On the way, he called Sebastian.

When the call connected, he said gravely, "Sebastian, you need to come back quickly. Something has happened."

Isabella's phone kept ringing.

The call was from Sebastian, but she didn't answer.

She didn't even look at it. She hugged her knees, staring blankly, trembling all over.

Nina helped her get dressed, her voice choked. "Bella, I'll take you home."

Leo came in from outside, smelling of smoke.

He said nothing, walked over, and picked Isabella up in his arms, carrying her out.

Nina wiped her tears and followed.

As they neared home, Isabella suddenly spoke, "I don't want to go home!"

Nina held her. "Bella, what did you say?"

"Don't take me back!" Isabella said.

Leo glanced at her through the rearview mirror. "Okay."

At the hotel, Leo booked a suite.

This time, Isabella didn't let him carry her. She got out of the car and walked into the elevator.

In the suite, Isabella said, "Nina, I want to take a bath."

"Okay." Nina quickly went to run the water.

Leo stopped at the door, closed it, and had the hotel prepare two sets of clean clothes for Isabella.

Then he stood by the window, unknowingly smoking an entire pack of cigarettes.

###chapter 168 Why Not Just Tell Him

Isabella soaked in the bathtub, lost in her thoughts.

Nina, worried she might do something drastic, stayed close by.

After half an hour, Isabella finally broke the silence. "Nina, Raymond didn't do anything to me, did he?"

Isabella had a hunch. There were no marks on her body, and she felt no discomfort. But she needed to hear it to be sure.

Nina shook her head. "No, he didn't. Deborah took off your clothes. Luckily, Leo showed up in time, and you called the cops yourself. Otherwise, who knows what could've happened."

Isabella closed her eyes, a tear slipping down her cheek.

She had called the police on her way there, but she was too worried about Nina at the time, thinking it would be fine if she went up first.

Who could have thought that Deborah and Raymond would do such a despicable thing?

Even though Raymond didn't touch her, the thought of Deborah using her filthy hands to take off her clothes made Isabella feel utterly disgusted.

She had indeed underestimated how evil people could be!

Nina said, "It was Charlie who deceived me. He used the pretext of discussing divorce to tie me up. Bella, I almost got you hurt!"

If Isabella had really been raped by Raymond today, Nina wouldn't have been able to live with herself.

Isabella, with tears on her face, asked, "Charlie didn't do anything to you, did he?"

Nina replied, "No. Fortunately, Zaire came to find me, otherwise, who knows what would have happened."

Actually, Nina didn't tell the truth.

Back then, she was in real danger. Charlie tied her up and locked the warehouse door. Originally, Charlie intended to wait until Raymond succeeded before releasing her. However, later, Charlie even tried to force Nina to have sex with him in the warehouse.

The one who broke in to save her wasn't Zaire, but one of Richard's men. Zaire had also just come to find her.

Nina didn't have time to dwell on the fact that Richard had sent someone to monitor her. She and Zaire talked, and they brought Charlie back to save Isabella.

However, they were still a step too late.

When they arrived, Leo had already brought the police into the house and had Raymond and Deborah under control.

With the situation exposed, Deborah quickly confessed everything, saying she was the one who took off Isabella's clothes.

Raymond, at that time, had only taken off his pants halfway.

Even so, Nina was furious.

How could Isabella be treated so badly by someone like that?

It was already midnight when Isabella finished her bath.

She crawled into bed, and her phone rang again.

Seeing the name "Seb" on the screen, Isabella's nose tingled; she couldn't help but shed tears.

Nina, watching from the side, couldn't bear it and said, "Answer it."

Isabella wiped away her tears before answering the call.

The moment the call connected, Sebastian fell silent on the other end.

Isabella didn't speak either, but her fingers tightened around the phone.

She thought, 'Sebastian must care a lot about this, right?'

Even she felt humiliated, let alone Sebastian.

After a dozen seconds, Sebastian's voice came through, heavy and clearly suppressing a surge of anger. But he was still afraid of scaring her, so he softened his tone as much as possible. "It's okay now. I'm on my way back. You can sleep peacefully, and you'll see me first thing in the morning."

Isabella wanted to say something, but her throat felt like it was stuffed with cotton, and she couldn't speak.

After hanging up, Isabella just kept crying.

Nina felt a pang in her heart. After hesitating for a long time, she finally said, "You're already showing; why not tell him about the baby?"

Isabella looked at her.

Nina explained, "Originally, there was no rush, but after what happened, I don't want there anything else to come between you and Sebastian."

The baby was already a barrier; if this incident made things worse, Nina didn't dare to think about it.

After much thought, she felt the best way to fix things was to tell Sebastian the truth about the baby.

Isabella understood Nina's point, but wouldn't mentioning it now make her seem even more guilty?

Isabella shook her head. "No, I can't tell him now!"

Isabella had never thought of using the baby as a bargaining chip. It could be discussed at any time, but not now! Not when she needed Sebastian's complete trust!

"What will you do then?" Nina asked, worried.

Isabella turned her back to Nina, wrapped in the blanket, and said in a muffled voice, "I need to think it over."

Zaire came by late at night.

Isabella was already asleep.

To avoid waking her, Nina and Zaire went to the outer room to talk.

Nina asked, "How is it? Enough to press charges?"

Zaire said, "Raymond has been detained; the judicial process is underway. Since you and Charlie are still legally married, and he didn't cause you actual harm, it's considered a family issue. After giving his statement, he was released from the police station."

Nina gritted her teeth. "But if it weren't for Charlie, how could Bella have come to the house to find me? If she hadn't gone to the house, she wouldn't have fallen into their trap. This has everything to do with Charlie!"

Letting Charlie go like this was a real shame!

Nina now regretted it every time she thought of Charlie. She should have listened to Bella earlier. If she had divorced Charlie before having a child, none of this would have happened.

Zaire said, "I understand how you feel. But we have no evidence. From start to finish, Charlie just answered a phone call."

Zaire added, "But don't worry, I'll have someone keep an eye on Charlie."

This meant that Charlie better not make any mistakes elsewhere. Otherwise, Charlie wouldn't escape.

"That's all we can do," Nina said.

Zaire asked a few more questions about Isabella. It was very late; he and Leo, being men, were of no use there. The hotel was under the Jose group. Zaire had already spoken to the staff to ensure absolute safety.

Leo and Zaire left the hotel together.

Just as Leo was about to get in the car, Zaire called out to him, "Leo."

Leo turned around.

Zaire didn't speak, just stared at him.

"What's up?" Leo asked.

Zaire asked, "Why were you at Green Valley Community?"

Leo's eyes flickered, and he said, "I followed Isabella there."

"You followed Isabella?" Zaire was a bit surprised and puzzled. "Why?"

Leo said, "We visited Samantha at the psychiatric hospital during the day. After I took Isabella back, she seemed emotionally unstable and looked unwell. I was worried, so after work, I went to check on her. Just as I arrived, I saw her driving out of the neighborhood. So I followed her."

Zaire pondered for a moment and nodded. "Sounds reasonable."

Leo said, "It's the truth."

Zaire gave him a deep look. "I hope Sebastian will believe you when he asks."

After saying that, he got in the car and left.

Leo stood there for a moment before getting in his car and leaving as well.

###chapter 169 He's Back

Zaire's man called. "Mr. Jose, we followed Charlie to Pine Hill Residences like you said."

"Pine Hill Residences?" Zaire mused while driving. "What's he doing there?"

"Not sure. We got the house number. A woman opened the door for him," the subordinate hesitated. "Should we go in and check?"

Zaire pulled over. "Looks like Charlie's got some secrets. This woman might be his mistress, cheating on Nina. If he's meeting her, barging in would be illegal. Just keep an eye on him."

"Okay. One more thing, Mr. Jose. We noticed another group tailing Charlie too."

Zaire remembered the man in black from when he was looking for Nina. He frowned, worry creeping in. "Do you know who they are?"

"No idea."

"Alright. Keep watching and update me."

"Yes, Mr. Jose."

At Pine Hill Residences.

"What are you doing here?" Vanessa, in a nightgown, let Charlie in and quickly locked the door, drawing the curtains tight.

Still uneasy, she checked the balcony.

Charlie hugged her from behind, sniffing her. "Vanessa, you smell so good. Did you take a bath just for me?"

Vanessa frowned but didn't push him away. "How did you find this place?"

They'd been flirting for months, mostly through calls and texts. They met occasionally at bars or hotels, but she never gave him her address. She was shocked he showed up.

"What's wrong?" Charlie's hands roamed over her. "Aren't you happy I came?"

Vanessa finally pushed him away and went inside. Charlie quickly followed.

"You just got out of the police station, right?" Vanessa sat on the couch, eyeing him.

"Yeah," Charlie said. "I didn't even go home. I came straight to you. Vanessa, I've sacrificed a lot for you. My mom's in the hospital, my brother's in jail, and I'm pretty shaken up. You have to comfort me, right?"

Vanessa was furious. "You were being followed; did you know that?"

Charlie stiffened. "What? How is that possible?"

"Go look at the two cars parked downstairs. Pine Hill Residences is a poor neighborhood. Usually, there aren't any cars worth more than ten grand. Those two are worth over thirty grand each."

Charlie ran to check and saw it was true. He was instantly terrified. "Is it Zaire, Richard, or Sebastian?"

Vanessa sneered. "You've made quite a few enemies, haven't you?"

Charlie grabbed her hand. "Vanessa, what do we do? We're being watched! What do we do?"

"What else can we do?" Vanessa pulled her hand away, coldly saying, "Charlie, no matter who sent those people, we can't escape now!"

Charlie's legs went weak. "Vanessa, I did all this for you. You can't abandon me!"

"How could I?" Vanessa wrapped her arms around his neck, her body writhing in his embrace. "You've done so much for me. Am I that heartless?"

Charlie, holding Vanessa, felt a bit comforted. His desire surged, and he started undressing her.

Vanessa gently pushed him back. "Charlie, there's one way to turn this around. Are you willing to do it?"

Charlie, eyes closed, kissed her all over. "What way? Just tell me. I'll do it."

Vanessa's eyes showed a hint of disgust, but she had to endure it. She hugged him tightly and whispered something in his ear.

Charlie was shocked, his eyes wide open. "Doing that would be outrageous!"

"I know, but it's our only way out now. If we don't do it, we'll both die!" Vanessa looked at him affectionately, her fingers drawing circles on his chest. "I promise you, once this is over, we'll get married."

Charlie's eyes showed hesitation. He stared at Vanessa for a while, then suddenly grabbed her butt hard. "Then I want you now!"

Vanessa's eyes flashed, instinctively wanting to refuse. But seeing Charlie's expression, she knew she had teased him too long. If she wanted him to obey, she had to make some sacrifices.

So Vanessa willingly gave herself to Charlie.

From Maple Valley to Lakina, it was a five-hour drive.

Sebastian hadn't slept all night.

Jack placed a cup of coffee in front of him, his expression serious. "Mr. Landon, as soon as we left, Mr. Charles Landon took over the project."

Sebastian drank his coffee, frowning, silent.

Jack checked his phone. "I've looked into it, over the past month, we've lost several big deals. We're looking at losses of at least eight figures. Now, the Northhaven land has been put on hold, and we can't start construction for now."

Sebastian received an email. He opened it, and his face instantly turned cold.

They were photos. All of Isabella's nudes.

Sebastian glanced at them and closed the email. "Find out who sent this. I want answers by tomorrow!"

Jack nodded. "Got it. I'll arrange for someone to investigate right away."

In the morning, a thin mist covered the entire city.

Isabella felt the bed sink slightly. She opened her eyes suddenly and grabbed the person's arm. "Sebastian."

As her vision focused, she saw Nina's face.

Nina said, "Bella, it's me."

Isabella propped herself up on her arms, anxiously looking around, but there was no sign of Sebastian. However, she clearly felt Sebastian had been there, and his cool scent seemed to linger in the air.

Was it her imagination?

Sebastian said he'd be back by dawn, and now it was already bright outside. Hadn't he returned?

"Bella." Nina gently patted her hand. "Sebastian was here. He stayed with you for a while, saw you were sleeping soundly, and didn't wake you."

Isabella felt a bit relieved. "Where is he?"

Nina replied, "He got a call and went out."

As soon as she finished speaking, Isabella threw off the covers and got out of bed.

Nina reached out to support her. "Bella, don't rush."

"Okay." Isabella nodded. She said she wasn't rushing, but her anxiety was almost visible in her eyes.

Isabella said, "I'm going to find him."

Nina seemed to want to say something but ultimately didn't. She nodded. "Okay."

Watching Isabella leave, a trace of worry flashed in Nina's eyes. She wondered if this incident would drive a wedge between Isabella and Sebastian.

###chapter 170  Don't Cry

Sebastian and Zaire stood in the hallway outside the suite.

After a long silence, Zaire asked, "What's your plan?"

Sebastian glanced at him. "Every debt gets paid."

Zaire paused, then asked, "Should we tell Isabella?"

Sebastian frowned, staring into the distance. "Isabella's too kind. I'll handle the dirty work."

"Got it," Zaire nodded.

He turned and saw Isabella approaching.

He quickly coughed, "Isabella."

To Isabella, it seemed like Zaire was signaling Sebastian to wrap up the conversation.

Sebastian paused, put out his cigarette, brushed off the smoke, and walked up to her. His dark eyes locked onto hers. "Awake?"

Sebastian looked exhausted, with a faint smell of tobacco. His eyes seemed burdened with heavy thoughts.

Isabella felt a sudden pain looking at him.

She couldn't meet his gaze and looked down after a few seconds.

She felt ashamed in front of Sebastian.

Zaire broke the awkward silence. "I have to go. See you."

He headed to the elevator and left.

Isabella stared at her toes, struggling to find words, but then Sebastian pulled her into a warm hug.

His arm wrapped around her, his chin resting gently on her head.

"I'm sorry," he said softly.

She looked up, surprised, but only saw his jaw.

"I couldn't protect you," Sebastian's arms tightened around her.

Isabella's nose tingled, and she hugged his waist. "I was too stupid."

If only she had waited for the police, all of this could've been avoided.

"I should be the one apologizing."

Sebastian cupped her face, wiping her tears with his thumb. "Don't cry."

The more he said it, the more she cried.

Sebastian kissed away her tears, his heart aching.

Finally, he held her tightly, sighing, "Bella, you break my heart."

Isabella hugged him tightly, burying her face in his shoulder. "Sebastian, why are you so good to me?"

Sebastian turned, his cheek brushing hers, his hand on the back of her head. "You're mine. If I'm not good to you, who should I be good to?"

Isabella closed her eyes, feeling like she had the whole world.

Nina went to work.

Sebastian hadn't rested all night. He rushed back and spent the morning in video meetings, handling business.

By noon, just as he was about to take a break, Jack walked over. "Mr. Jose sent a message. Charlie's mother passed away."

Isabella looked up, surprised.

Sebastian frowned. "Wasn't she just fainted and not in serious condition?"

Jack shook his head. "Details are unclear. Mr. Jose said the situation's complicated."

Isabella's heart tightened.

Indeed, it was complicated.

With Deborah's death, Nina would definitely be blamed.

After all, Nina hit her!

Sebastian closed his laptop and stood up. "Let's go to the hospital."

Isabella quickly stood up. "I'm coming too."

Worried Sebastian might leave her behind, she didn't even grab her coat and rushed to the door.

Sebastian walked over and told Jack, "Get her coat and hat."

He helped her put them on, adjusting her collar. "Stay calm."

Isabella bit her lip and nodded.

Sebastian took her hand, and they left together.

At the hospital.

When they arrived, Zaire and Leo were already there.

Surprisingly, Susan and Emily were also there.

Seeing Isabella and Sebastian holding hands, Emily's eyes flickered, but she hid it well.

Sebastian glanced around. "Why are they here?"

Leo explained, "My sister wasn't feeling well, so Emily came with her. I ran into Zaire downstairs, asked him a few questions, and came up to see if I could help."

"Help?" Sebastian's gaze was sharp. "Are you sure you're here to help?"

Leo smiled. "I can't do much."

Susan interjected, "What's going on? I heard Isabella had an incident last night. Is she okay?"

Her question was insincere.

Everyone could tell she was being deliberate.

Sebastian looked at her coldly. "Who told you?"

Susan took out her phone and opened a webpage. "Just a few minutes ago, a lot about Isabella was posted online. Didn't you know?"

Isabella quickly took out her phone. When she checked online, she saw her name trending.

She clicked in and saw not only text but also several nude photos.

She scrolled down, and the comments section was full of insults.

As Isabella continued to scroll, Sebastian took her phone away.

"Jack!" His voice was deep.

Jack lowered his head. "Mr. Landon, the IP is very complex. It will take another seven minutes to get the exact address."

"What IP?" Isabella asked.

Jack glanced at her, then looked at Sebastian.

Without Sebastian's permission, he didn't dare to explain.

Sebastian had no intention of explaining. He just instructed Jack, "Handle it immediately!"

"Yes."

At that moment, the door to the ward opened, and Charlie was lying by the bed, crying loudly, "Mom, don't leave me alone, Mom."

No matter how he cried, Deborah's body was already cold. She was eventually taken to the morgue.

Charlie was about to go too, but at the elevator, he turned back and shouted at Isabella, "Isabella, you and Nina killed my mom. I won't let you get away with this!"

Isabella was shocked.

Zaire looked at Charlie coldly. "I asked the doctor. Deborah only had a head injury and was temporarily unconscious. Her vitals were stable. In the morning, a nurse even took her blood pressure, and she was kind of conscious."

Sebastian also stared at Charlie, slowly saying, "So, she shouldn't have died."

Charlie shivered. "What are you talking about? Nina killed my mom! Don't think you can get away with this by saying that. This isn't over!"

###chapter 171 He Seems to Have Changed

Facing big shots like Sebastian and Zaire, Charlie was just a joke.

Charlie's words might scare ordinary people like Isabella.

She started worrying about Nina because of him.

But to Sebastian and Zaire, Charlie's words meant nothing.

Charlie quickly lost his nerve, avoiding eye contact and looking guilty.

"Charlie, you left Pine Hill Residences early and went straight to the hospital. Then, thirty minutes later, the news of your mom's death came out. Could there be a connection?" Zaire speculated casually.

But Charlie's face changed instantly. "Mr. Jose, you can't say that. Nina hurt my mom and she was sent to the hospital. The police were there. How is this my fault? That's ridiculous!"

He was so worked up that his face turned red.

Zaire smiled faintly. "I was just curious. Why are you so defensive?"

Charlie was speechless.

He noticed everyone's expressions were off, especially Sebastian and Zaire, who seemed to see right through him.

Feeling regretful, Charlie knew he shouldn't stay and left.

As soon as he left, Zaire signaled to his subordinate, "Keep an eye on him!"

The subordinate nodded and followed Charlie.

Soon, news came from Moon Club that Nina had been taken by the police.

Isabella was anxious but didn't push Sebastian.

She knew from experience not to be impulsive.

'Like Sebastian taught me, stay calm no matter what,' Isabella thought.

Sebastian took a call and then said, "We're going to the police station."

Isabella nodded, and they left.

Susan muttered, "Isabella and Nina are such trouble!"

Zaire, who was texting, glanced at her.

Susan quickly said, "Zaire, why are you involved? You usually don't meddle."

It seemed like Isabella and Nina's business.

Given Isabella and Sebastian's relationship, Sebastian had to step in if something happened to them.

But why was Zaire so dedicated?

Zaire paused and said, "Nina is my sister."

Susan was shocked.

Even Emily and Leo looked over.

They knew about the missing daughter of the Jose family and that the family had been searching for years.

No one thought she'd be found after all this time.

But she was.

Zaire looked at Susan with a hint of regret.

He shouldn't have told her but couldn't hold back.

Zaire said, "Isabella is with Sebastian, and Nina is part of the Jose family, so don't look down on them."

Then, Zaire left.

Susan wanted to call him back but didn't.

Watching Zaire walk away, Susan knew calling out wouldn't make him stay.

Once he was out of sight, she muttered, disappointed, "He's really changed over the years."

Deborah was dead, and Nina was detained. Sebastian had managed to suppress all the online news.

So much had happened in just two days, making Isabella anxious.

Even though she knew Sebastian and the Jose family would handle it, she still couldn't sleep well.

When she woke up, the bed was already empty.

Isabella put on her slippers and went downstairs. As she reached the staircase, she heard Jack and Sebastian talking quietly.

She couldn't make out their conversation, so she held onto the railing and walked down. When they noticed her, they stopped talking.

"You go handle it," Sebastian said, waving Jack off and walking towards Isabella.

Jack nodded and left.

Worried about Nina, Isabella asked, "Why is Jack here so early? Did something happen?"

Sebastian hugged her. "No."

He didn't mention their conversation, only asking, "Are you hungry?"

Isabella was indeed a bit hungry.

She was in her mid-pregnancy, past the early stages, and had a good appetite.

Because of all the recent stress, she hadn't eaten well in the past two days. Now she was really hungry.

Sebastian took her to the dining room, where a spread of food and snacks awaited.

Since Zoe moved out, they had changed nutritionists several times. Sebastian had been very strict with the nutritionist's requirements to ensure Isabella's health.

Today's dishes were perfect for a pregnant woman.

After eating her fill, Isabella pushed the dishes away.

Sebastian said, "I have to go out for a while. If you need anything, call me."

Isabella nodded but still asked worriedly, "What about my sister..."

"She'll be fine," Sebastian said, patting her head.

Isabella paused and then asked, "Any leads on the photo leak?"

At the hospital, Sebastian had asked Jack to investigate.

When she came downstairs, Isabella vaguely heard something about the IP address Sebastian had mentioned before.

With Jack's efficiency, there should be results by now.

Isabella didn't ask earlier, waiting for Sebastian to tell her.

When Sebastian was about to leave without saying anything, Isabella got anxious and finally asked.

Sebastian paused and said, "It's still under investigation. But there's one thing I need to tell you."

"What is it?"

"Charlie's mistress is Vanessa."

Isabella was stunned, "It's her?"

Her first reaction was shock, but then it all made sense.

"So Vanessa got involved with Charlie to get back at me?"

Sebastian held her shoulders, "This has nothing to do with you. It's Vanessa's own disgrace."

"I need to handle some company matters. Stay home and don't go anywhere. If anything happens, call me. What happened that day must never happen again. Understand?"

Isabella nodded slowly.

After Sebastian left, she sat on the sofa, lost in thought.

Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

###chapter 172  He Did It

Isabella jumped when the doorbell rang, snapping out of her thoughts. She rushed to the door but paused, remembering Sebastian's warning, "That incident must never happen again!"

She pulled her hand back and turned on the video intercom. The screen flickered and showed Leo at the door. Relieved, she opened it.

"It's you," Isabella said.

"Is Sebastian home?" Leo asked.

She shook her head. "Are you looking for him?"

Leo's expression was serious. "I'm here for you."

"Me?" Isabella was puzzled. She had no connection with Leo, so it had to be about Samantha.

Isabella offered, "Do you want to come inside?"

Leo shook his head. "I'll just say it here. When Samantha woke up, I asked her about her tongue. She wanted me to give you this."

He handed her a folded piece of paper. Isabella hesitated, feeling like it was burning her hand.

"What's wrong?" Leo asked.

"Nothing." She took the paper and unfolded it. It was Samantha's handwriting.

After reading it, Isabella's eyes widened, and she stepped back, pale. "Impossible. How could Sebastian cut off Samantha's tongue?"

"I didn't believe it either. But she got very emotional and broke down."

"Isabella, I found out something else."

She looked at him, afraid to ask.

Leo continued, "The person who exposed your photos was Vanessa."

Isabella's heart sank. "But Sebastian said he hadn't found out yet."

Leo shook his head. "I know it's hard to believe. Sebastian isn't heartless. He probably didn't tell you to protect Vanessa."

Isabella was stunned. Leo's words made sense. Vanessa was Sebastian's ex-fiancÃ©e, so it was normal for him to have lingering feelings. But if Sebastian still cared for Vanessa, what did that make her?

The exposed photos were a major shadow in her life. Everyone who knew her probably knew about them now. How could she face anyone?

Isabella felt lost.

"Isabella, you once saved me, so I can't watch you fall apart," Leo said. "If I'm right, Sebastian did this to Samantha to silence her. Matthew is in prison, and Sebastian has already retaliated against the Landon family. Samantha is no longer useful."

"Isabella, I warned you about Emily because she and Sebastian had a thing long ago. When my sister went abroad, Emily followed, and her relationship with Sebastian ended. Emily came back to get back together with Sebastian, so be careful."

"Isabella, break up with Sebastian. I think he's using you to get back at the Landon family. Now that Emily's back, I'm really worried you'll get hurt."

"Enough!" Isabella finally found some strength and cut Leo off. "Stop talking!"

Leo pursed his lips, then suddenly stepped forward, grabbed her arm, and hugged her tightly.

"Isabella, when you've thought it through, call me anytime. I'll help you."

Before she could push him away, Leo had already opened the door and left.

Isabella stood there for a few seconds before her legs gave out, and she sat on the floor.

She sat quietly for a moment, then with trembling hands, took out her phone and dialed Sebastian.

"Hello."

The call connected, but Isabella couldn't find the words.

"Isabella?" Sebastian's voice was tense. "What's wrong?"

"I'm fine," she said, shaking her head. "Just wanted to ask what you're doing and when you'll be back."

"I'm still busy. I'll be home late tonight. You go to sleep first. Be good."

"Okay." Isabella nodded, but tears streamed down her face.

She looked down and saw her hand was wet with tears.

Isabella sat on the floor for a long time before getting up and going upstairs.

She curled up in bed, holding Seb's pillow. She inhaled his scent but still felt extremely anxious.

Outside the villa, Sebastian sat in his car, staring at the faint light from the second-floor window, his brows furrowed deeply.

"It's hard to believe without seeing it," Zaire, sitting in the passenger seat, said.

Waiting here was Zaire's idea.

"Are you going to go down and ask her?" Zaire asked.

Sebastian withdrew his gaze. "Ask what?"

"Why did Leo come to see her? What did he say to her for so long?"

Sebastian gripped his phone tightly. "She seemed like she wanted to say something earlier."

For some reason, Isabella didn't say it. Maybe she didn't trust him enough? Or did she feel he wasn't someone she could rely on?

Sebastian wanted to know but was more afraid of scaring Isabella.

"Let her be. When she wants to talk, she will. If she doesn't want to, I won't force her."

Zaire was silent for a few seconds. He knew Sebastian didn't want to talk about it anymore, so he changed the subject. "Do you need my help with Leo?"

Sebastian said, "No need. In the end, he's just being used. The real enemy is Charles!"

Finding out about Leo's issues wasn't difficult. Leo used to be a playboy. Then he suddenly became ambitious and succeeded in a few projects but still couldn't earn Henry Anderson's approval. Henry always looked down on Leo, thinking he only knew some sneaky tactics. All the Anderson family's hopes were placed on the eldest son, Kevin Anderson. It meant that no matter how well Leo did, he wouldn't be valued.

Perhaps out of desperation, Leo started taking extreme measures. He even made deals with Charles.

Zaire nodded. "Have you decided what to do?"

Seb's brows furrowed deeply. "A confrontation between us was inevitable. But it's time to settle it. I don't care what happens to me."

He turned his gaze back to the room with the light on the second floor. "But I won't allow Isabella to be hurt anymore!"

###chapter 173 Confessing Love to Each Other

Isabella had another nightmare.

She dreamt Vanessa, in a wedding dress, took Sebastian's arm, and they walked down the red carpet into the chapel.

Vanessa and Sebastian exchanged rings and kissed in front of the priest.

"No!"

Isabella suddenly waved her hand, but her fingers touched a warm, firm chest.

She opened her eyes to find it was already light outside.

Sebastian had returned and was lying beside her, sound asleep.

Even in his sleep, his hand was tightly wrapped around her waist, as if afraid she would disappear, and they were closely pressed together.

Waking up from a nightmare to find Sebastian by her side made Isabella feel like the happiest person in the world.

Seeing Sebastian still asleep, Isabella didn't wake him.

She quietly watched him for a while, then gently traced his eyebrows and eyes with her finger.

Suddenly, her finger was caught by his hand.

Startled, Isabella exclaimed, "You're awake?" She felt both embarrassed and caught in the act.

Sebastian kissed her fingertip, his voice husky, "You woke me up by touching me."

Isabella felt embarrassed. "Sorry, go back to sleep. I won't bother you anymore."

"No way,?" Sebastian guided her finger back to his eyebrows and eyes, closed his eyes again, and said with enjoyment, "Keep touching. Don't stop."

Isabella was speechless.

Sebastian had already let go of her hand.

Looking at his eyebrows and eyes, Isabella felt a sense of peace.

She pursed her lips and once again reached out to touch his eyebrows and eyes. Her fingers traced down his nose and continued downward.

Sebastian enjoyed that. When Isabella's fingers reached his lips, she noticed that the corners of his mouth had already turned up slightly.

Her fingers trembled, and she saw him open his eyes again.

Sebastian looked at her deeply and said, "Bella, you have a magical touch."

With that, he grabbed her wrist and guided her hand under the covers.

When he led her hand to his genitals, Isabella's face instantly turned red.

She curled her fingers, feeling exposed under Sebastian's gaze.

But Sebastian wouldn't let her escape and directly kissed her lips.

After their intimacy, Isabella leaned against his chest, panting.

Sebastian had a satisfied look on his face, with one hand slowly combing through her long hair gently.

Isabella's breathing gradually steadied, and she looked up to meet Sebastian's brown eyes.

She blinked and said, "I..."

Unexpectedly, Sebastian also spoke at the same time, "You..."

They both started speaking simultaneously and then stopped, smiling at each other.

Sebastian lowered his head and kissed her on the forehead. "You go first."

Isabella bit her lip and said, "Last night, Leo came to see me."

Sebastian's eyebrows moved, surprised that she would tell him directly. He patiently listened, waiting for her to continue.

"He told me that Samantha's tongue was cut off by you."

Sebastian frowned, "He said that?"

Isabella hugged him and moved closer. "Did you do it?"

Sebastian laughed, saying, "You're asking me because you don't believe what he said?"

"Yes." She nodded, then shook her head. "Partly. But I trust you more than Samantha and Leo."

Isabella's sincere gaze warmed Sebastian's heart.

His fingers paused in her hair, and Sebastian's palm cupped the back of her head. He turned her over and pressed her down, looking at her intently. "Really?"

Isabella nodded. "Really!"

She didn't know how much this trust meant to Sebastian.

Sebastian smiled happily.

He pecked her lips repeatedly, like a kid with a new toy.

Isabella finally interrupted him, "I was sad for a long time last night because of this. After thinking it over, I decided to ask you directly."

"What if I say I didn't do it?"

Isabella blinked. "Then I will believe you."

Sebastian kissed her again. "Bella, with your trust, I wouldn't be afraid even if the whole world turned against me!"

Isabella hugged him tightly. "No one would turn against someone as good as you."

After a pause, she added, "I won't allow it!"

Her ears turned red. She had never said anything so cheesy in her life, but she didn't regret it. This was what she wanted to say to Sebastian.

"I know things have been chaotic lately, and so much has happened. It's definitely not a coincidence. Even if you don't tell me everything, I can figure out some of it. I had my doubts, but in the end, I still chose to believe you."

Every word Isabella said warmed Sebastian's heart.

Isabella shyly glanced at Sebastian, and his intense gaze made her lower her eyes. "I just want to tell you that no matter what happens, I will always be on your side."

He lifted her chin and kissed her deeply.

After releasing her, Sebastian's eyes were moist. "Bella, why do you trust me so much?"

Isabella's eyes flickered, and her fingers gently touched her rounded belly.

'Because Sebastian is the father of the child!' Isabella thought.

Because she knew he was a good person!

Or maybe there were other reasons.

Or maybe there were no reasons at all.

Just because he was Sebastian!

Sebastian stared at her for a moment, then suddenly smiled. "I know."

Isabella's heart skipped a beat. "You know?"

Did he know about the child?

Sebastian's hand brushed her nose. "Bella is in love with me."

Isabella's eyes widened, but she couldn't refute it.

She was in love with Sebastian!

She seemed to have already fallen in love with Sebastian.

Only by falling in love with Sebastian would she trust him unconditionally!

Would she want to be his support, even though she was weak herself!

This was a feeling she had never experienced before!

A peculiar feeling grew in Isabella's heart.

Sebastian was overjoyed.

He kissed her until her lips were swollen, not knowing how to express his happiness.

In the end, Sebastian just held her tightly, whispering his love in her ear.

"Bella, I love you."

Listening to his confession, Isabella felt her heart swell.

Sebastian said that once this matter was completely resolved, they would get married.

In the heat of the moment, Isabella wanted to tell him about the child, but she felt he was already too excited today.

If she mentioned the child, she feared he would be overly excited!

And things were too complicated now; he must have a lot to deal with. Telling him now would only distract him.

At any time, Isabella didn't want to be a burden to Sebastian. So she turned all her words into a kiss, wrapping her arms around his neck and kissing him.

Sebastian was pleasantly surprised and deepened the kiss, holding her waist tightly.

###chapter 174  Rotten Fish and Shrimp

After Nina spent three days in the detention center, Charlie had already hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit.

When Isabella and Sebastian went to pick up Nina, they saw Zaire's car at the entrance.

Inside, they found Kelsey and Margaret waiting.

"Isabella, Sebastian, you're here."

"Yeah," Isabella nodded, exchanging a glance with Margaret. "Margaret," she greeted politely.

Margaret's eyes were wet as she responded.

Sebastian said, "You guys got here early."

"We just arrived. My dad and brother are handling the bail and paperwork. My mom and I are waiting for my sister."

Isabella didn't expect the whole Jose family to be there.

Hearing Kelsey call Nina her sister warmed Isabella's heart.

Though Nina never said it, Isabella knew Nina longed for family affection and warmth.

Soon, Zaire and Steven returned after completing the bail procedures.

A minute or two later, the door opened, and Nina came out.

"Nina!"

Isabella and Kelsey called out at the same time, then shared a knowing smile.

Seeing so many people, Nina was stunned for a moment and said, a bit embarrassed, "Why are you all here?"

Kelsey stepped forward, holding her hand. "We're here to pick you up. Mom and Dad got up early and urged me several times!"

Nina was still a bit uncomfortable with Kelsey's affection but didn't push her away like before.

Nina's acceptance seemed to encourage the Jose family.

Margaret secretly wiped her tears, and Steven looked pleased.

Zaire said, "This isn't the place to talk. Let's go home. Mom had the housekeeper prepare a lot of dishes this morning."

Everyone looked at Nina, worried she wouldn't want to go.

Especially Margaret, who now had eyes full of unease.

Seeing Nina not answering, Margaret quickly said, "We don't have to go home. We can book a restaurant too."

"Let's go."

Margaret looked at Nina in surprise.

Nina met her gaze for a few seconds, then looked away. "Since all the food is prepared, it would be a waste if I didn't go."

Margaret smiled through her tears. "Alright, let's go home."

"Let's go, Nina. Let's go home," Kelsey said, holding Nina's arm tightly.

Nina held her hand in return, and Kelsey looked at her with surprise and joy.

Nina didn't look at her, took a few steps forward, and extended her other hand to Isabella.

They walked out hand in hand.

Seeing this, Margaret couldn't hold back her tears.

Steven walked over, put his arm around her shoulder, and whispered, "It's okay. Don't let the kids see you crying."

Margaret nodded, wiped away her tears, put on a smile, and followed them out.

As soon as they walked out of the police station, they ran into two officers escorting Charlie.

Charlie was talking as he walked.

His face was red and swollen, his suit tattered, and he was covered in animal feces. The stench was strong enough to smell from a distance.

If it weren't for his voice, Isabella and Nina wouldn't have recognized the disheveled man in front of them as Charlie!

"Officer, listen to me, I didn't steal anything. I was framed," Charlie pleaded.

He turned his head and saw Nina, stunned.

Nina stood in front of a black Maybach, the car door open, with everyone gathered around her.

"Nina?" Charlie started to walk over, but Zaire blocked him. "Get lost!" he said coldly.

Charlie shivered, took a step back, but insisted, "Nina, you set me up, didn't you?"

Nina frowned. "I don't know what you're talking about."

Kelsey chimed in, "Sister, don't talk to this scumbag, or you'll end up smelling too!"

Nina nodded, got into the car.

Charlie, still stunned, asked Kelsey, "She's your sister?"

Kelsey ignored him, pinched her nose, and told the officers, "This guy is bad news! Look into him thoroughly; you'll find a lot of dirt!"

She made a vomiting gesture and got into the car.

Charlie fumed as everyone else got into their cars.

Three luxury cars drove away.

Charlie watched, filled with jealousy. "Nina was just someone I tossed aside, but now she's with the Jose family, riding in a car I've never even been in!"

He replayed the scene in his mind.

He had seen Kelsey before and knew she was Zaire's sister, the Jose family's daughter.

She was always arrogant. How could a rich girl like Kelsey recognize Nina as her sister?

Charlie knew a bit about Nina's past. She had told him she was abandoned by her parents.

Could she be the Jose family's daughter?

Charlie shook his head. "That's impossible. How could Nina be the Jose family's daughter?"

He dismissed the thought.

"Who did you say roughed you up?" an officer asked as they took him to the interrogation room.

Charlie scratched his head. "It was Richard Cole, the owner of Casino One!"

In the car, Kelsey asked, "Nina, you haven't divorced that douchebag yet?"

Talking about it gave Nina a headache. "No."

They were in the process of getting a divorce, but Charlie had dragged it out.

"Do you still have feelings for him?"

Nina laughed. "No."

When Isabella first advised her to get a divorce, Nina was reluctant.

But after everything that happened, her marriage to Charlie was long dead.

"Then why not get it over with sooner?"

Margaret didn't ask any questions, but her eyes were always on Nina.

Margaret wanted to ask too but was afraid Nina would reject her.

###chapter 175  Die Together

Nina paused and said, "It's over."

It was tough, but she wasn't hesitating anymore.

Kelsey was right. Charlie was a jerk, and she needed to stay away from him.

"Bella?" Nina noticed Isabella was quiet, deep in thought. Worried, she asked, "What's up? You okay?"

Isabella shook her head. "No. Nina, did you see what happened to Charlie?"

"Yeah, I did," Nina sighed. "Honestly, it was satisfying."

Kelsey chimed in, "Whoever put that jerk in his place deserves some good luck!"

Kelsey's words made Nina think about what Charlie had said earlier.

"Nina, you set me up, didn't you?"

Why would he say that?

Did someone secretly get revenge for her?

The Jose family? Unlikely.

Sebastian? Isabella didn't seem to know either.

Then who?

Nina thought about it and Richard's face popped into her mind.

Her heart skipped a beat, and her fingers curled up.

Was it Richard?

At the Jose family home, the servants had set the table early, and the food was already served.

Isabella looked at the spread. It was even more lavish than last time.

"We didn't know what you and Bella like, so we made a bit of everything. Come, sit and eat," Margaret said.

Everyone took their seats.

Nina pulled Isabella to sit down, and Kelsey joined them. "I'll sit next to Nina."

Isabella noticed Margaret wanted to sit closer to Nina, so she let go of Nina's hand. "I'll sit with Sebastian."

Nina didn't say anything.

After Nina sat down, Margaret nervously asked, "Can I sit here?"

This was Margaret's home, yet she seemed so reserved.

Nina pursed her lips and stood up to pull out the chair for her. "Please, have a seat."

"Okay," Margaret said repeatedly.

Nina's small gesture made Margaret's eyes well up with tears.

The meal was harmonious.

After the meal, the men went upstairs to the study to talk.

Kelsey took Nina and Isabella for a tour around the villa.

When they reached a room, Kelsey stopped and said, "Nina, you open this door."

Nina looked at her suspiciously. "Why?"

Kelsey just pushed Nina forward. "You'll see."

Nina hesitated but eventually turned the doorknob. The room came into view.

It was a bright bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows on one wall. The curtains fluttered, bringing in the scent of flowers. The room was clean and fresh, with a wooden table holding a vase of lilies. Dolls were scattered around, adding a girlish touch. A nearby cabinet held books ranging from classic literature to children's picture books.

Kelsey opened the closet, revealing girls' clothes arranged from small to large, all with new tags. Shoes, socks, and accessories were neatly organized.

"Look here," Kelsey said, opening the window.

Sunlight flooded the balcony, overlooking the garden. The breeze carried the scent of flowers.

"This is your room," Kelsey said. "It has been waiting for you since we moved in. Mom bought a doll every year for your birthday. She also buys new dresses and shoes every year. These books are from kindergarten to college. Even now, Mom sometimes goes to the bookstore by herself, picks out good books, and places them on your shelf."

Nina lowered her eyes. "No matter what she does, it can't make up for abandoning me back then."

"Mom never abandoned you," Kelsey said, her eyes red.

She wanted to say more, but Margaret's voice came from the door, "Kelsey!"

"Mom, let me say it."

Margaret shook her head and said to Isabella, "Bella, can you and Kelsey step out for a moment? I want to talk to Lisa alone."

Isabella nodded and pulled Kelsey out of the room.

"Mrs. Jose, I should leave now," Nina said.

"Lisa," Margaret grabbed her hand, almost pleading, "Don't go. Please don't go, okay?"

Nina turned slightly away. "Mrs. Jose, your daughter Lisa died the day you abandoned her. Maybe she starved, froze, or was beaten to death for stealing food."

Nina pointed to the table. "She can't use any of this. Maybe you should put a photo of her there.."

"Lisa," Margaret cried, her heart breaking. But she never let go of Nina's hand.

"I know you hate me and you should. But Lisa, can you listen to what I have to say?"

Nina remained silent.

Margaret, crying, said, "I got a letter from your father back then. He was framed in business, lost all his money, and was kidnapped! I sold the house and took the money to save him."

"Then why didn't you take me with you?" Nina turned, her eyes filled with tears. "You said you'd let me take a leave from school and then take me to find Dad! I took the leave, but you left. You abandoned me and left me all alone."

Margaret shook her head desperately. "It's not like that. I didn't abandon you or not want you. I went to find your dad, ready to die if necessary. I thought if things went wrong, I'd die with him. But Lisa, you're my daughter, you were so young. How could I let you die?"

"What if I wanted to die with you?" Nina cried out in anguish.

Margaret was stunned.

###chapter 176  Won't Abandon Her

Margaret was stunned, tears silently streaming down her face.

"I'd rather die with you than stay there alone. Every night, I curled up next to trash heaps, digging through garbage cans for food, chased by dogs, and bullied by other homeless people! Do you know how helpless I felt? How much I wanted you to hold me?"

Nina shook her head, her voice trembling, tears flowing uncontrollably. "You wouldn't understand! Even so, I waited for you in Alvia for half a year, but you never came back!"

"No!" Margaret cried bitterly. "I asked Olivia Taylor to take care of you. Didn't she get my letter? Or was she delayed?"

Margaret panicked. "Lisa, believe me. I didn't abandon you. I sent a letter to Olivia asking her to take care of you! I really didn't know."

Nina wiped her tears, her tone calm. "Mrs. Jose, from the moment I left Alvia, Lisa was already dead. I'm Nina now, and my only family is Isabella."

"No!" Margaret screamed in agony.

Nina looked at her. "I'm grateful for your help. Today, I came to repay your kindness and Mr. Jose's. From now on, we go our separate ways."

She tried to pull her hand back, but Margaret clung tightly to her arm. "Lisa, don't do this to me. I beg you."

Nina stopped, looking at her calmly. "If I go back to the Jose family now, Isabella will end up just like I was when I was abandoned. I promised her I'd be her family for life. Even if I die, I won't leave her behind."

Margaret was stunned.

At that moment, Nina pulled her hand back, opened the door, and walked out without hesitation.

"Lisa!" Margaret's cries echoed from the room.

Nina paused for a moment, wiped away her tears, and walked away quickly.

Isabella and Kelsey were waiting at the staircase.

Kelsey kept stretching her neck. "It's been so long. I wonder how Mom and Nina are doing."

Isabella waited quietly, looking down at the potted plant in the corner, not saying a word.

"Isabella?" Kelsey poked her shoulder. "What's wrong?"

Isabella looked at her and shook her head.

"Are you reluctant to part with Nina?" Kelsey asked directly.

A flash of sadness crossed Isabella's eyes. She shook her head, denying it.

"Oh, don't be shy. I know you don't want to part with her. How would you feel about having more family, like me as a sister?"

Isabella blinked. "What do you mean?"

"Oh, I mean..."

Suddenly, a shout interrupted Kelsey's words.

"Mom!" Kelsey turned quickly and saw Nina walking out.

She hurried to meet her, asking, "Nina, where's Mom?"

"In the room." Nina's face was still streaked with tears.

Kelsey felt something was wrong and quickly ran to find Margaret.

Isabella was also startled by the shout and wanted to follow, but Nina grabbed her wrist.

"Let's go." Nina pulled her downstairs.

"Nina," Isabella called, but Nina didn't respond. She just held Isabella's hand, walked downstairs, and left the Jose Mansion.

Since then, Nina never went back to the Jose family.

Kelsey mentioned a few times to Isabella that Margaret fell ill after that day.

Isabella knew what Kelsey meant. She wanted her to tell Nina.

So after work, Isabella found an excuse to invite Nina to dinner.

Isabella ordered a few spicy dishes, but Nina took the menu. "Considering your condition, it's better to eat less spicy food."

Then she added two light dishes and a nourishing soup.

Isabella touched her round belly. "They say if you crave sour food, you're having a boy. I loved sour food early on, but now I can't get enough of spicy food. I wonder if it's a girl or a boy."

"Whether it's a girl or a boy, it's your baby, right?" Nina said with amusement. "By the way, I've been learning to knit. You're six months along now. As your kid's aunt, I need to start preparing. I've picked out a few colors. Take a look."

Isabella turned off her phone. "As long as you choose it, I'll like it. My baby will love it too!"

"Then I'll choose?"

Isabella nodded. Seeing Nina in a good mood, she hesitated and said, "I heard Margaret is sick. Should we go see her?"

Nina's fingers paused, but she stayed calm. "No need."

Isabella added, "Kelsey said she's quite seriously ill."

"Bella!" Nina put down her fork and looked at her. "I don't want to talk about this. Can we talk about something else?"

Isabella bit her lip. "Nina, do you really not want to acknowledge them?"

"No!" Nina answered firmly and decisively.

"Why?"

Nina sighed, picking up her fork again. "Why does there have to be a reason? I've been on my own for so many years. Suddenly having so many family members, I don't like it."

She gave Isabella a lot of food.

But Isabella didn't touch her fork. She just looked at Nina and said after a long time, "Nina, you're doing this for me!"

Nina stiffened and smiled. "Don't be so self-centered. I'm not doing it for you. I just don't want to acknowledge them."

Isabella held her hand. "Nina, go back to the Jose family!"

Nina looked at her in a daze.

Isabella said, "I know you don't want to leave me, but going back to the Jose family doesn't mean abandoning me. Whether you're Nina or Lisa, you'll always be my sister! That won't change. You don't have to worry about me. I have Sebastian now, and in a few months, our baby will be born. I'm not alone anymore."

Nina was moved. "Bella."

"You did it for me, and I'll do it for you. I'm really happy that you found your family. You should go back!"

Nina was silent for a long time.

Her emotions changed several times.

Nina finally showed a hint of a smile. Just as she was about to say something, a gust of wind passed, and a tall, imposing figure stood by their table.

Isabella turned and saw Richard's fierce face.

"Mr. Cole?" Nina spoke.

The next second, Richard grabbed her and dragged her out.

###chapter 177 Entering the Hotel

Everything happened so fast that by the time Isabella reacted, Nina was already being dragged out of the restaurant.

"Nina!" Isabella shouted, grabbing her coat and bag, and ran after them.

Outside, it was freezing. It had just rained, and the temperature was super low.

Richard pulled Nina to the car, opened the door, and pointed at Cynthia inside. "What's this about?"

Nina was stunned.

"Nina," Isabella called, rushing over. She was shocked to see who was in the car.

It was Cynthia, the nurse from the hospital who had asked for Richard's number earlier.

"Hi," Cynthia greeted, looking very fashionable but clearly drunk, her cheeks flushed and hiccupping.

Nina finally spoke, "Mr. Cole, what's going on?"

Richard, still gripping Nina's arm, stared coldly. "Answer my question first. What's this about?"

Nina was confused. "What do you mean? I don't get it."

"Her!" Richard pointed at Cynthia. "Why is she here where we were supposed to meet?"

Nina was baffled and sensed danger. "Mr. Cole, I think you're mistaken. I never agreed to meet you, and I don't know what you're talking about."

"You don't understand?" Richard laughed angrily, reaching into his pocket.

"Nina!" Isabella, scared, rushed to hug Nina.

Richard was taken aback.

He saw Isabella and Nina hugging, their eyes filled with fear, as if he was pulling out aÂ  gun.

Richard was both angry and amused, his fierce face twisting even more.

Isabella and Nina were terrified.

Then Richard pulled out his phone, and they both sighed in relief.

Richard had calmed down. He unlocked his phone, opened WhatsApp, and showed it to Nina. "Haven't you been chatting with me?"

Isabella glanced at the chat history.

The messages were bold, full of hints and direct affection.

Nina looked at the profile picture and shook her head. "That's not me!"

"What did you say?" Richard's eyebrows shot up, his face turning cold again.

Isabella quickly said, "I get it! Mr. Cole, did you think this was my sister's WhatsApp?"

Richard retorted, "Isn't it?"

Nina steadied Isabella and explained, "Mr. Cole, this isn't my WhatsApp."

Richard looked suspicious.

Isabella pointed at Cynthia in the car. "Last time, I got the number from her, so the WhatsApp you added was hers, and it was her chatting with you."

Richard was speechless.

So, the person he had been chatting with wasn't Nina!

In the car, Cynthia was getting impatient. She waved at Richard. "Mr. Cole, why aren't you getting in? Weren't you going to show me your rose garden?"

Richard rubbed his head in frustration and instructed the driver, "Take her back."

"Yes."

The car drove away, but Richard stayed.

He turned to Nina and said, "You add me, or should I add you?"

Nina was confused.

Richard didn't waste time. He pulled out his phone and handed it to her to enter her contacts.

Nina was about to refuse when Isabella quickly took the phone and entered her number, adding Richard on WhatsApp.

"Done," Isabella said, handing the phone back to Nina.

Nina looked at her, speechless.

Nina thought, 'I'll just delete him later.'

But Richard glared at her.

He put his phone back in his pocket and said, "In my life, I'm the only one who deletes others."

Nina didn't believe it. "You've never been deleted by someone?"

"Yes," he said. "But those people are already six feet under."

After a pause, Richard smirked, "I buried them myself."

Nina tightened her grip on Isabella's hand. "We should go back."

But Isabella pulled her hand away and said, "Nina, Sebastian is coming to pick me up soon. You and Mr. Cole still have things to discuss, so I won't disturb you. Have a good chat!"

Isabella even made a cheering gesture!

Nina was speechless.

Richard walked to the roadside and opened the door of a black Range Rover. "Ms. Miller, don't make me use force."

Nina wanted to run, but he grabbed her wrist. "Ms. Miller, you're not making this easy, are you?"

Nina was momentarily dazed as he pulled her into the car.

Before she could refuse, the car drove away.

Isabella watched the car drive off, exhaled, and smiled.

She could tell Richard liked Nina.

Oddly, she felt that a strong and domineering man like Richard was a good match for Nina.

Isabella was very cold on the street. She was supposed to have dinner with Nina tonight, so she hadn't arranged for Sebastian to pick her up.

But she could go find Sebastian.

She hailed a cab and headed to the Landon Group building.

As soon as the cab arrived, Isabella saw Sebastian's car coming out of the parking lot.

She quickly told the driver, "Please follow that car."

Sebastian's car sped to a five-star hotel.

Isabella's cab was a step slower. When she arrived, she saw Sebastian walking into the hotel with a woman.

The woman's hand was hooked around his arm.

Isabella took a few steps forward but suddenly stopped.

She turned back to the cab, gave her home address, and had the driver take her back.

Isabella took a shower, lying on the bed, her mind filled with the image of Sebastian and the woman entering the hotel.

She trusted Sebastian.

Sebastian had also said he loved her.

So, she must have misunderstood Sebastian.

Thinking this, Isabella felt much more at ease.

Her phone beeped twice.

Isabella quickly picked up her phone and saw a message from Leo. A trace of disappointment flashed in her eyes.

She opened the chat, and Leo had sent a few photos.

In the photos, Sebastian was holding the woman's waist as they entered a hotel suite.

This time, Isabella saw the woman's face clearly.

Isabella felt a buzzing in her head, instantly wide awake. She sat up abruptly.

"Emily!"

###chapter 178 Performance

Sebastian didn't get back until 2 a.m.

Isabella heard a car pull up, slipped on her shoes, and rushed downstairs.

The kitchen lights were on. By the door, there wea a pair of men's leather shoes and a pair of women's high heels.

Isabella's heart sank. She saw Sebastian leaning against the table with a glass of water, talking to Emily.

Emily noticed Isabella and stepped back. "Isabella, Sebastian drank too much. I drove him back."

Isabella stayed silent, noticing Emily's dress was the same one she'd seen at the hotel earlier.

"It's late. I should go," Emily said, grabbing her bag and leaving.

Sebastian didn't react, just kept drinking his water.

Once the door closed, Isabella walked into the kitchen.

Standing in front of Sebastian, she smelled the alcohol. "Why did you drink so much?"

She reached for the glass, but Sebastian grabbed her chin and kissed her.

His kiss was intense, pushing her back against the table. The edge dug into her waist, causing pain.

Isabella started crying, and Sebastian finally let go.

Seeing her tears, Sebastian was surprised. "Why are you crying?"

Isabella pushed him away and went upstairs.

Sebastian followed, throwing his jacket on the sofa. "Isabella, I'm really tired. Don't make a fuss."

She stood up, crying, "Am I making a fuss? I saw you both go into the hotel. Sebastian, what did you do?"

Sebastian's eyes flashed, and he smashed a vase.

The crash was loud.

Downstairs, Emily heard the noise and smirked before walking away.

The room was a mess.

Isabella stood there, stunned.

Sebastian checked the balcony, then closed the window and drew the curtains. He turned off the lights and gently pulled Isabella into his arms.

"Did I scare you?" His voice was gentle now.

Tears still hung at Isabella's eyes. She nodded, "Yes."

Sebastian wiped her tears. "Should I be gentler next time?"

Isabella shook her head. "No! If it doesn't look real, they won't believe it."

She glanced back. "Is she really gone?"

"She's gone, but others are still watching." Sebastian led her to the bathroom, wrung out a towel, and wiped her face. "Deborah's death is suspicious. Charlie was in a rush to cremate her, but we stopped him. The body is now set for an autopsy, so we should have answers soon. Don't worry about Nina; Zaire will help. The Jose family won't just stand by and let her be falsely accused and jailed. Zaire will also handle her divorce with Charlie."

"Okay."

"I'll be busy for a while and spending more time with Emily. No matter what Leo says, don't believe him. If he asks you out, let me know right away, okay?"

"Okay."

"In the second drawer of the study, there's an envelope. If Emma comes to you, give it to her."

Isabella's eyelashes fluttered. "What's in it?"

Sebastian paused. "It's evidence that could send me to prison."

Isabella was shocked. "What?"

"It's fake!" Sebastian gripped her shoulders. "But it looks real. They'll believe it. Just give it to Emma when she comes. Don't worry about anything else."

Isabella placed her hand on his. "You won't get in trouble, right?"

"No," Sebastian shook his head.

But Isabella was still doubtful. "Will Emma really come to me?"

"She will," Sebastian said confidently.

The next morning, Isabella saw Emily in the dining room.

Emily was dressed in a sharp professional suit.

Emily smiled. "Good morning, Ms. Miller."

Isabella ignored her and looked at Sebastian, who was eating. "Why is she here?"

Sebastian's expression was indifferent. "You're further along in your pregnancy. Starting today, you don't need to go to the company. Emily will take your place."

Isabella bit her lip. "I don't agree!"

With a loud clang, Sebastian slammed his utensils down. "Isabella, the Landon Group is not yours to control."

Isabella's eyes reddened, and her tone softened. "Sebastian, you promised me."

Sebastian interrupted impatiently, "I'll keep my promises to you. But stay out of my business with Emily."

He stood up and walked over.

When he reached Isabella's side, Sebastian paused. "Isabella, remember your place."

With that, he walked out of the dining room.

Emily followed a step behind. She said to Isabella, "Ms. Miller, don't misunderstand. There's nothing going on between Sebastian and me."

Tears welled up in Isabella's eyes, filled with jealousy. "I doubt there's anything innocent between you two either."

"Believe what you want." Emily smiled and left.

The car drove away.

Inside, Sebastian leaned against the back seat, supporting his temple with one hand. His mind was filled with the image of Isabella from earlier.

He was heartbroken.

He had to restrain himself from going back to hug her.

Since this act had started, they couldn't stop. They had to see it through.

But Sebastian couldn't stand seeing Isabella suffer. It was more painful than anything he had ever experienced.

Especially since he was the one causing her pain.

"Sebastian," Emily's voice sounded in his ear.

Sebastian opened his eyes, and Emily's face came into view.

Emily handed him a handkerchief. "There's something on the corner of your mouth."

Sebastian took it. "Thanks."

Seeing his troubled expression, Emily said, "Did Ms. Miller misunderstand what happened last night? She might not listen to me, but if you explain, I'm sure she'll believe you."

Sebastian sneered. "Why would I explain to a doormat?"

"Doormat?" Emily was puzzled.

Sebastian looked away, staring out the window, his voice cold. "I chose her because Matthew cares about her, and the Landon family values her. Do you think I'd be interested in a pregnant woman otherwise?"

###chapter 179 Praising My Husband

Emily was a bit taken aback. "Is she really pregnant?"

"It's just a bastard!" Sebastian snapped, clearly annoyed.

Emily was surprised. Even if Sebastian didn't like Isabella, she didn't think he'd say something so harsh.

Sebastian scoffed. "She probably doesn't even know who the father is!"

Sebastian was a stickler for cleanliness, especially in relationships.

From what Emily knew, the baby wasn't Matthew's or Sebastian's.

So, Isabella must've been with other men too.

No wonder Sebastian was upset.

Emily dismissed her doubts, clutching her handkerchief. "Sebastian, you don't have to pretend in front of me."

Sebastian's eyes narrowed. "Pretend?"

"Yeah. I know you're using me."

Sebastian was caught off guard.

He didn't expect Emily to figure it out.

So, all the drama with Isabella was pointless?

Not entirely, since Charles's people were watching the villa.

Last night's and this morning's act would be reported to Charles.

But Emily knowing still surprised him.

Emily smiled. "Actually, Charles met with me before you did."

Sebastian frowned. "He wanted to make a deal?"

"Yep." Emily nodded. "Charles was furious about Matthew's imprisonment. He said he wanted to take back everything he gave you and make you pay. He wanted me to ruin your relationship with Isabella. If I succeeded, he'd have you marry me and make me the young mistress of the Landon family."

Sebastian laughed. "He's really full of of himself. He never gave me anything."

Sebastian had built the Landon Group from scratch.

In fact, Charles had tried to sabotage him early on.

Now, Charles claimed he wanted to take back what he never gave.

Besides his life, Charles hadn't given him anything!

"Charles is a control freak. Sebastian, I shouldn't have gotten involved between you and Ms. Miller, but I couldn't help it. I refused Charles. I was afraid he'd find someone else, so I came to you."

"I was going to tell you, but last night at the hotel, I saw Ms. Miller."

"I knew you were acting, so I played along. This morning, when you asked me to be your assistant, replacing Ms. Miller, I agreed."

"I don't know what you're planning, but I'm on your side."

"As long as I can protect you, I'm happy."

Emily's words were heartfelt, and even Sebastian, who'd seen a lot, was moved.

He said softly, "Thank you, Emily."

"You're welcome." Emily smiled.

She glanced out the window. "Pull over up ahead. I called a car, and it's on its way. You should go back and comfort Ms. Miller. What you said was pretty harsh."

"Okay."

Sebastian had the driver pull over, then headed back home.

Isabella was having breakfast when she heard the car and froze.

Isabella jumped up and ran to the window. She saw Sebastian getting out of the car, looking cold as he walked into the house.

She rushed to the door. "Why are you back?"

Before she could finish, Sebastian pulled her into a tight hug.

Isabella was stunned and tried to push him away. "Where's Miss Lopez?"

"She went to the company on her own."

Isabella was shocked. "How could you let her go alone? We just had a fight, and now you're back. She'll get suspicious!"

Seeing her panic, Sebastian laughed.

"Oh, come on! You need to go," Isabella insisted, pushing him.

Sebastian suddenly picked her up and placed her on a cabinet. It was three feet high, and Isabella, being pregnant, was scared and clung to his hand.

Sebastian raised an eyebrow and smiled. "Not pushing me away now?"

Isabella looked nervous. "Put me down, it's too high."

Sebastian held her securely. "Calm down and listen to me."

Isabella blinked and met his calm eyes, feeling a bit more at ease.

Sebastian said, "Emily knows we're acting."

Isabella's heart skipped a beat. "How does she know? Was our act for nothing? What do we do now?"

Sebastian stroked her back gently. "Listen to me."

Isabella looked at him anxiously.

"Charles approached Emily for cooperation, but she refused. She's willing to go along with our act now, so we don't have to try so hard in front of her, just enough for Charles to see."

Isabella was confused. "So she's helping us?"

"Yes."

Isabella sighed in relief, feeling a bit embarrassed. "Then what I said to her earlier was really too much."

"It's okay." Sebastian squeezed her fingers, comforting her. "She didn't take it to heart. She even asked me to come back and be with you."

Isabella was touched. "Miss Lopez is really a good person. Put me down, it's too high."

Sebastian smirked. "Call me 'husband.'"

Isabella blushed but said, "Husband."

Sebastian pushed further. "Praise your husband."

Isabella was speechless.

"I'm not good at praising people."

Sebastian asked, "Are you sure?"

Before Isabella could answer, he pretended to let go. "Should I let go?"

Isabella quickly grabbed his hand. "Don't let go. I'll fall!"

"Then hurry up and praise me."

Isabella, on the verge of tears, mustered her courage and said, "Husband, you're so handsome."

Sebastian shook his head. "Too half-hearted. Say 'Husband is great, husband is awesome, and I love husband to death.' Say it three times, and I'll let you down."

Isabella sighed. "You might as well kill me."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow and pretended to let go.

Isabella knew he wouldn't really let go. It was just a playful game between them.

Though embarrassed, she played along and said it three times.

"Husband is great. Husband is awesome. I love husband to death."

After that, Sebastian let her down.

But he didn't let go of her. He pressed her against the door and kissed her passionately.

###chapter 180  Luring the Snake Out of Its Hole 1

Two days later, the hospital reported that Deborah's death was not natural. After a few days in the morgue, her body showed unusual dark purple livor mortis. The autopsy revealed she died from asphyxiation.

All fingers pointed at Charlie.

Isabella was eating when she heard the news. She felt sick and threw up everything she had eaten. She couldn't believe Charlie would kill his own mother, Deborah!

Nina's divorce was finalized, and Sebastian produced the $80,000 IOU that Charlie owed Casino No. 1. With infidelity, Deborah's murder, and gambling debts, Charlie was in deep trouble.

But when the police arrived, Charlie had already fled! Vanessa was missing too.

Zaire's people had been watching Vanessa for over two weeks but still lost her.

That evening, everyone gathered to discuss.

"With Charlie and Vanessa missing, we can't be sure they won't retaliate. Nina and Isabella are in the most danger," Zaire said. "I've increased security around Nina. Charles and Sebastian have arranged security around Isabella's villa. Don't worry."

"But for safety, it's best if you don't go out."

Nina stood up slowly. "I know Charlie. He's scared and won't come out. You can protect us for a while, but not forever. As long as Charlie isn't caught, the danger will always be there."

Everyone fell silent. They couldn't guard forever. Charlie wouldn't come out while things were tense. If he stayed hidden, he'd always be a threat.

Sebastian said, "I agree with Nina."

Zaire frowned. "I agree too, but Charlie knows the whole city is after him. He won't fall for a trap."

"He will!" Nina said firmly. "I have a way to lure him out!"

It snowed all night, and the temperature dropped. The weather forecast warned of the first cold wave of the year.

The basement was freezing. Vanessa, dressed thinly and wrapped in a man's coat, was still cold.

Footsteps approached, and the lock turned. Vanessa looked at the door, hoping it wasn't Charlie.

The key turned, and Charlie walked in. Vanessa slumped down.

"Damn, it's really coming down out there!" Charlie cursed, taking off his snow-covered hat. He pulled a sweet potato from his pocket and tossed it to Vanessa. "Eat."

Vanessa picked it up and frowned. "Sweet potato again? I'm sick of eating it every day!"

Charlie glared at her. "You know our situation. Be grateful you have anything to eat. I risked getting caught to buy this. If I get caught, it's over!"

Vanessa threw the sweet potato aside in anger. "If you hadn't dragged me here, I wouldn't be suffering like this!"

She had a new place lined up after her lease at Pine Hill Residences ended. It was spacious, bright, with heating, hot water, and a bustling mall downstairs. But before she could move, Charlie dragged her here.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. She tried to leave, but the door was locked.

Charlie caught up, grabbed her collar, and slapped her. Vanessa stumbled and fell, her coat slipping off to reveal her thin, bruised body. She was only wearing pajamas when Charlie dragged her out in the middle of the night.

She had asked to go back several times. Charlie had killed someone, but what did that have to do with her? She didn't want to stay in this dirty, smelly basement with him!

At first, Charlie coaxed her gently. Later, he got impatient and started hitting her. Once he started, he didn't stop. After hitting her, he'd apologize and slap himself.

Vanessa had seen Charlie's terrifying side and learned to be obedient. She tried to pick the lock a few times when he went out for food, but he always caught her. He locked three locks from the outside, so she couldn't escape unless he allowed it.

Being locked in this dark place for days had taken a toll on Vanessa's mental state, and she finally broke down. Charlie didn't coddle her, punching her a few times. When she was silent, he picked her up and threw her on the bed. He picked up the sweet potato, wiped it off, and handed it to her again. "Eat. As long as you're willing to share my hardships, I won't let you starve."

Vanessa hugged her knees, her body aching, unable to cry. When the sweet potato touched her lips, she turned her face away. Charlie grabbed her face and shoved the sweet potato into her mouth. Her struggle was futile, and she ended up with a mouthful of sweet potato.

At that moment, a news bulletin appeared on the TV. "Breaking entertainment news: the Jose Group has found their long-lost daughter and will hold a banquet for her in three days. The grand event is already being meticulously prepared."

Vanessa stared at the TV, eyes wide in disbelief. She pushed Charlie's hand away, unable to speak with her mouth full of sweet potato. She pointed at the TV, making muffled sounds and tearing up from choking.

"What is it? Why are you so surprised?" Charlie turned around.

The news was still on. The host was revealing some details, and Charlie was staring at the small screen. Even though the face in the photo was pixelated, he recognized it immediately. It was Nina!

###chapter 181 Luring the Snake Out of Its Hole 2

Three days later.

The Jose family.

As night fell, the grand family reunion banquet was about to start.

Isabella, who was pregnant, wore a custom-made dress. Nina's dress was specially prepared by Margaret.

When Nina put on the white, flowing dress, she instantly looked radiant.

"Nina, you look stunning!" Kelsey said, echoing Isabella's thoughts.

Nina always had an elegant air, but years of hardship had dulled her shine. In this dress, her hidden pride and beauty resurfaced.

Nina looked at herself in the mirror, wearing the exquisite dress and delicate makeup, with the light above her making her look like a princess.

"It's just a performance. Do I really need to be this dressed up?" Nina asked, nervously pinching the hem of her dress.

"We thought the same," Kelsey replied. "But Mom insisted you look your best tonight. You don't even know this dress is actually..."

"Kelsey!" Margaret interrupted, walking in just in time.

Kelsey bit her tongue, remembering her promise to Margaret.

Even without Kelsey saying it, Nina guessed the dress was not only expensive but also carried the family's heartfelt intentions.

The fabric was light and soft, but it made her heart feel heavy.

Margaret took the comb from the makeup artist and gently styled Nina's hair, each stroke filled with love.

Nina realized Isabella and Kelsey had slipped away, leaving her alone with Margaret.

She sat quietly, looking at herself and Margaret in the mirror.

"All done," Margaret said, showing Nina her hair through a hand mirror. "Do you like it?"

Nina turned slightly and said sincerely, "It's beautiful. Thank you."

Margaret smiled. "As long as you like it. I've dreamed of this moment for twenty years. Your hair was always so nice when you were a child. I'm glad to style it again."

Nina felt a pang of sadness. "You've lost a lot of weight."

Margaret smiled. "Losing weight is good. At my age, many people want to lose weight but can't."

Nina smiled back. "You look beautiful no matter what."

A servant knocked and entered. "Mrs. Jose, Mr. Jose said it's almost time. Please come downstairs with Ms. Jose."

"Alright." Margaret wanted to take Nina's hand but hesitated, fearing it might upset her. Her hand froze mid-air before she pulled it back.

Seeing this, Nina reached out and grabbed her hand.

Margaret was stunned.

Nina, feeling pity, lowered her gaze and said, "My heels are too high. I'm afraid of falling. It's safer to hold onto you."

Margaret smiled and nodded. "Alright."

Nina and Margaret walked down the stairs hand in hand.

Cameras flashed non-stop, capturing every moment of their synchronized steps.

The Jose family's banquet was grand, with all the media in Lakina invited, and influencers live-streaming the event.

This was also to ensure Charlie could see it in real-time.

The goal was to make Charlie see the Nina he abandoned living a princess-like life, driving him mad with jealousy and desperation, even risking showing up.

For the guests' safety, Zaire and Sebastian had set up comprehensive security.

They had people surrounding the Jose estate, with layers of security around the entire villa area.

No one knew if Charlie would show up, but if he did, he wouldn't get away!

Isabella, being pregnant, wasn't allowed by Sebastian to go downstairs, so she stayed on the second floor with Kelsey.

They stood by the railing, looking down at the crowd below.

Isabella's gaze followed Nina as she walked across the red carpet, up to the stage, and stood between Steven and Margaret.

Then, Steven began to speak.

The crowd below was bustling, and Isabella thought that if Charlie came, it would be hard to spot him among so many people.

Kelsey, feeling restless, said, "I'm going to get something to drink. Want anything?"

Isabella nodded. "Juice, please."

"OK." Kelsey made a gesture. "I'll bring you a piece of cake too."

Isabella watched her lift her dress and run off, chuckling to herself.

After Steven finished speaking, he and Margaret presented a set of jewelry to Nina.

When the box was opened, the crowd gasped.

"Wow, isn't that the 'Luna Luxe' set Mrs. Jose bought for two hundred million dollars back then?"

"Two hundred million dollars, my God!"

"Mrs. Jose said she would save this set for her daughter. Was it prepared for her?"

"It seems so. Things are more valuable when regained."

"Ms. Jose went through some hardships, but now she's finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel."

Charlie stood in the crowd, listening to the discussions around him, a sharp glint in his eyes.

He had been lurking for ten minutes, witnessing Nina's descent from upstairs.

The jewelry set made him grip the short knife in his hand tightly.

Who would have thought that the Nina, now treasured by the Jose family, was the woman he had discarded?

When he worked at the W.S Group, he had tried to curry favor with people of status, hoping to marry a wealthy woman.

Who knew the woman he casually discarded was the wealthy person he could never win over!

If things hadn't changed, if he and Nina hadn't ended up like this, he would now be the son-in-law of the Jose family, wearing a custom suit, standing with Nina, and receiving admiration.

All of this should have been his!

A look of resentment flashed in Charlie's eyes. At that moment, he saw Kelsey walking by.

He adjusted his mask and followed her.

Meanwhile, in the monitoring room, Jack noticed something unusual. He walked out while calling Kelsey.

"Sorry, the number you dialed is temporarily unavailable."

How could he forget?

Kelsey had blocked him a long time ago!

###chapter 182  Losing the Big for the Small

Jack had just run out when he bumped into Zaire.

"Mr. Jose, Charlie's here!"

"Where?"

"In Area B," Jack said, adding, "You should call Ms. Jose quickly, Charlie's right behind her!"

"Kelsey?" Zaire frowned, hesitated, then quickly dialed Kelsey.

The call connected.

"Kelsey, stay calm. Don't look back. Charlie's behind you!"

"What?" But it was Isabella's voice.

Kelsey had left her handbag behind when she went to get the cake.

Hearing this, Isabella stood up, looked downstairs, but couldn't find Kelsey.

"I can't find her," Isabella said, almost in tears.

Zaire tried to calm her, "Stay put. We've got everything set up. Just don't move."

"Okay, I won't move!" Isabella said.

After hanging up, she still anxiously looked downstairs.

Nina, who was downstairs, noticed Isabella's distress and texted her: [Did Charlie show up?]

Isabella replied, "Yes, Kelsey went to get the cake, and Charlie's behind her! Zaire and Jack are on their way. Be careful, Nina."

"Got it!"

Nina turned to Margaret. "I need to rest for a bit."

Margaret nodded. "Okay, I'll go with you."

"No need," Nina said, pushing her away. "I can go myself."

Without waiting for a response, she left.

Kelsey picked up two pieces of cake, two glasses of wine, and a cup of juice for Isabella. As she turned around, she saw Charlie.

Charlie was in disguise, wearing a mask, a wig, and a security uniform. Kelsey didn't recognize him but noticed his fierce look and glanced at him twice.

Suddenly, Charlie pressed a knife against Kelsey's stomach. She was stunned. Seeing the knife, her hand shook, and the tray fell.

At that moment, Zaire, Sebastian, and a group of people blocked the entrance.

Before Kelsey could react, Charlie grabbed her, pressing the knife to her neck.

"Charlie, you can't escape!" Zaire said coldly. "Let go of my sister, and I might let you die quickly!"

"Charlie?" Kelsey trembled with fear.

Seeing so many people, Charlie realized he was trapped. He gripped the knife tighter, dragging Kelsey backward, shouting, "Get back! All of you, get back!"

Kelsey felt a sharp pain in her neck, warm blood trickling down.

The knife had cut her skin, and bright red blood flowed.

Kelsey had never seen such a scene before. Besides, Charlie was a monster who had even killed his own mother, Deborah. Terrified, sheÂ screamed, "Zaire, save me."

The more she screamed, the more satisfied Charlie was. As long as Kelsey was in pain, the Jose family wouldn't dare to act rashly.

The more Kelsey screamed, the better Charlie's chances of escaping.

Sure enough, Zaire and the others didn't dare to come closer.

"Charlie, let go of my sister, and I'll give you a way out!"

Charlie sneered, not buying it.

By now, he had backed up to the window. The room had floor-to-ceiling windows, and it was on the first floor. If he got out, he could escape.

He glanced outside. The yard was dimly lit, but still dark enough to hide.

He worried that even if he got out, he wouldn't make it past the Jose family's yard.

He hesitated, thinking there might be people waiting to ambush him outside.

"Haha, I'm not that stupid!" Charlie sneered. "Call Nina. I want to see her, or I'll kill Kelsey! My life isn't worth much, but taking Kelsey with me would be worth it!"

"Charlie!" Suddenly, Nina's voice came from outside the window.

Charlie turned and saw her standing on the lawn.

She stood alone in the yard, looking at him. "Didn't you want to see me? I'm right here."

Charlie was uncertain. He needed to get out of the room first before figuring out how to leave the yard.

Staying here wouldn't help him.

Thinking this, he dragged Kelsey out through the balcony door.

As he expected, bodyguards were lurking on both sides.

Charlie tightened his grip on Kelsey's neck, shouting, "Don't come any closer, or I'll kill her!"

Nina calmly waved her hand, telling the bodyguards, "Back off."

The bodyguards silently retreated.

Sebastian and Zaire walked out, standing nearby, watching.

Zaire scanned the big tree outside the yard, where their men were hidden.

If the timing was right, a crossbow arrow could hit Charlie, paralyzing him instantly.

But Charlie was cautious. He probably noticed the tree, so he kept Kelsey in front of him, moving forward step by step.

He was very careful. Even when he reached Nina, he only showed half his face.

"Nina!" Kelsey cried, her makeup smeared, and a thin cut on her neck.

Nina looked at Charlie. "Charlie, let Kelsey go, and I'll be your hostage!"

Charlie's eyes fell on Nina, scrutinizing her. "I didn't expect you to be a Jose. We've been married for years, and you hid it so well. You've really made me suffer!"

"Charlie, I never hid anything on purpose. You ended up like this because of your own actions."

"My own fault? I did all this for you!" Charlie glared at her. "I'll count to three, and you walk over to me."

"One!"

"Two!"

Nina didn't hesitate and walked towards him.

Before he could count to three, she was already in front of him.

Charlie looked at Nina and found her unfamiliar.

He didn't expect Nina to have such a stunning side.

Compared to Vanessa, Nina was simply perfect.

And he had lost so much for so little.

###chapter 183 Blocking the Knife

"Let her free," Nina demanded.

"You want her free? Fine, but you do exactly what I say," Charlie replied with a sinister grin.

Nina nodded. "Our issues shouldn't involve others. Just tell me what to do."

Her compliance took Charlie back to the old days.

He was a small-town kid who made it to college, bringing pride to his family. Everyone adored him, and the whole village envied him. This made Charlie used to getting his way.

After graduation, he stayed in Lakina, got a decent job, and married Nina. Over time, he felt she didn't measure up, and his temper worsened. Nina tolerated him for a long time.

Charlie loved feeling in control.

"Take off your clothes!" he ordered.

Nina frowned. "Here?"

Though there were no guests, Zaire's men were everywhere.

Charlie wanted to humiliate her.

"Yes, right here. Take them off!" Charlie's excitement grew, and he tightened his grip on Kelsey, making it hard for her to breathe.

Kelsey gasped, "Nina, don't listen to him. He just wants to humiliate you. Don't do it."

"Shut up!" Charlie's grip tightened.

Kelsey's feet left the ground, her face turning red from suffocation, and she struggled.

Nina's heart raced. "I'll do it, just don't strangle her!"

Charlie chuckled, loosening his grip slightly but still holding Kelsey's neck. "Hurry up!"

Nina started unbuttoning her evening gown.

"Faster!" Charlie urged.

Nina quickened her pace.

As she undid the last button, Charlie's malice peaked.

Suddenly, a gust of wind brushed past Nina's ear.

A muffled sound of a blade piercing flesh followed.

Charlie screamed, clutching his eye.

A small, precise arrow had struck his eyeball, blood gushing out.

Kelsey, stunned, broke free and ran to Nina.

Nina stared in shock, overwhelmed.

The arrow had just missed her ear.

She turned and saw a tall figure emerge from the shadows.

It was Richard, dressed in black, followed by Michael.

Richard tossed the crossbow to Michael and strode towards her.

At that moment, Nina felt the world go silent.

It was as if all sound and sensation had faded, leaving only Richard's tall, dark figure approaching her.

"Stay back!" Charlie's voice was shrill.

He saw people rushing in, gripped his short knife tightly, and suddenly turned to stab Nina.

"Nina!"

"Mom!"

Nina saw a figure step in front of her.

Charlie's knife plunged into the figure's body.

Charlie let out a beast-like roar, glaring at Nina over the figure.

The next second, Charlie was subdued.

The figure collapsed in front of Nina.

"Mom!" Kelsey screamed, dropping to the ground and hugging Margaret, crying.

Chaos erupted.

Richard reached Nina, draped his coat over her shoulders, and held her firmly.

Nina's legs were weak; without Richard's support, she might have fallen.

She watched as people emerged from the shadows, saw Margaret lying on the ground with a knife in her chest, the blade fully embedded in her body, leaving only the handle visible.

Charlie was pinned to the ground, an arrow sticking out of his eye, blood gushing out. He struggled like a trapped beast, his face twisted, his other eye fixed on Nina. "Nina, even if I die, I'll crawl out of hell to find you!"

Richard looked at him coldly, a hint of murderous intent in his eyes.

Charlie was taken away.

Zaire rushed Margaret to the hospital.

The party ended abruptly, and the Jose family went to the hospital. Sebastian and Isabella stayed behind to wrap things up.

By the time they saw off all the guests, it was early morning.

When Isabella and Sebastian arrived at the hospital, the surgery was still ongoing.

Charlie's knife had struck Margaret's heart, putting her in critical condition.

Nina stood there in a daze, the blood on her dress long dried. She still wore Richard's coat.

Richard stood a few steps away, watching Nina.

After a while, Michael came out of the elevator and walked up to Richard. They exchanged a look, and Richard walked to a quiet corner with him.

Michael spoke first, "There's a problem at the casino that needs your attention."

Richard frowned slightly. "Got it."

He told Michael to go ahead and then returned to the surgery room, walking up to Nina. "I need to go back and handle something. I'll come find you when I'm done."

Nina's eyes were vacant, as if she hadn't heard him. She didn't even blink.

Seeing her like this made Richard's heart ache.

Zaire walked over. "Mr. Cole, thank you for your help tonight. If you have matters to attend to, please go ahead. I'll take care of her."

Richard nodded. "Thank you."

Zaire replied, "It's my duty. She's my sister."

Richard glanced at Nina again, said nothing, and turned to leave.

After about another hour, the surgery finally ended.

When the door opened, Nina stumbled forward.

Margaret lay on the bed, medical tubes attached to her body, her face as pale as death.

At that moment, Nina's legs gave out, and she couldn't take another step.

"Doctor, how's my mom?" Kelsey's eyes were swollen from crying.

"The surgery was successful, but the patient is still not out of danger. She's still in a coma, and the next 72 hours are critical. We'll monitor her closely. It all depends on whether she can make it through these 72 hours."

Kelsey leaned on the bed. "Mom will make it. She's the best."

She pulled Nina over. "Nina, talk to Mom. She cares about you more than anyone. If she hears your voice, she'll wake up sooner!"

Nina opened her mouth but couldn't say a word.

###chapter 184 Jealousy

After Margaret was admitted, the Jose family stayed by her side.

Zaire turned to Sebastian and Isabella, saying, "It's late, and Isabella's pregnant. You should go home and get some rest."

Sebastian looked at Isabella, noticing her tired, red eyes. "We'll go home first," he said, putting his arm around her. "Call me if anything happens."

"Okay," Zaire replied, giving Sebastian a firm pat on the shoulder. They exchanged a look.

As Isabella and Sebastian left the hospital, they saw Jack rushing over.

"Mr. Landon, we resolved the situation with Charlie. His eye is almost blind. The police and I found where he and Vanessa were hiding. Vanessa's in custody now. We'll wait for the police to finish their investigation."

Sebastian nodded. "Thanks. Get some rest."

Jack glanced at the hospital, hesitated, and asked, "How's Mrs. Jose?"

"The surgery went well, but we need to see if she gets through the critical period."

"Okay," Jack nodded. "Mrs. Jose is a good person; she'll be fine."

Despite his words, Jack stayed put, clearly still worried.

Sebastian and Isabella exchanged a look. Sebastian said, "If you're worried, go up and keep an eye on things for me. Isabella shouldn't stay here too long. We'll head back. You can help out if anything happens."

"Alright!" Jack replied and ran back into the hospital.

Isabella watched him go, feeling relieved for Kelsey.

On the way back, Isabella fell asleep.

When they arrived home, Sebastian looked at her sleeping face, reluctant to wake her. But considering the lurking danger, he had no choice but to gently shake her shoulder and softly called, "Bella?"

Isabella opened her eyes. "Are we home?"

"Yes," Sebastian said, withdrawing his hand. "You go inside first. I'll wait outside for a bit."

Isabella nodded. "I'll go in first then."

"Okay."

They got out of the car separately.

Isabella went inside first. As she changed her shoes at the door, she sighed, thinking, 'That was exhausting.'

The next morning, as Isabella came downstairs, she heard dishes breaking in the kitchen.

She hurried over. "Sebastian?"

But she saw Emily in an apron, with Sebastian in front of her, their hands touching.

Emily quickly pulled her hand back and explained, "I broke the dishes and cut my hand by accident. Ms. Miller, don't misunderstand."

Isabella didn't say anything. She found the first aid kit and placed it on the dining table. "You should treat it quickly to avoid infection."

"No need."

"Bella means well," Sebastian said, opening the first aid kit. "I'll help you."

Emily waved her hand. "I can do it myself."

Isabella saw the long cut on Emily's hand, with blood-soaked tissue wrapped around it. "It's okay. Let him help you."

Sebastian gave Isabella a meaningful look. He pulled out a chair and said to Emily, "Sit down. I'll take care of it."

"Then I won't be polite," Emily smiled and sat down.

Sebastian cleaned Emily's wound with disinfectant and cotton swabs, applied hemostatic powder, and wrapped it with gauze.

Isabella guided him the whole time, even making sure the gauze looked nice. She tied a neat bow herself.

"All done," she said.

Sebastian looked at it and praised, "Our Bella is really skillful."

Embarrassed, Isabella quickly pushed his hand away.

Emily noticed their playful banter and lowered her eyes slightly.

During breakfast, Isabella asked, "Miss Lopez, why are you still wearing an apron?"

Emily replied, "I wanted to make breakfast. Sebastian used to love my cookies, but I haven't cooked in a while. I messed up and even broke a dish. It's embarrassing."

"I love cookies too. Can you make them, Miss Lopez?" Isabella asked eagerly. "I'd love to try them next time."

Emily's smile stiffened slightly.

Isabella turned to Sebastian. "You love cookies?"

Sebastian looked at her calmly. "I used to."

"Not anymore?" Isabella asked, blinking at him with curiosity.

Sebastian chuckled. "Tastes change. If you like them, I'll have the nutritionist make some for you. No need to trouble Emily."

Isabella said, "My sister used to make cookies for me. It's been a long time since I had any."

Sebastian immediately called the nutritionist to make a batch for her.

Isabella ate them happily.

After breakfast, Isabella noticed Emily hadn't eaten anything.

Isabella and Sebastian had finished their meal, and she had even had extra cookies. But Emily's plate was untouched.

Emily smiled. "I have a habit of drinking milk in the morning. I already had some before coming here, so I'm not very hungry."

"Oh," Isabella nodded.

Emily stood up. "We should head to the office."

Isabella smiled and waved. "Bye-bye."

Sebastian walked to the door but stopped. He said to Emily, "Wait for me outside."

Emily glanced at Isabella, nodded, and went out.

Sebastian came back and pinched Isabella's cheek. "Jealous?"

Isabella blinked. "No."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "You've been talking a lot this morning and being overly friendly to Emily. You think I can't tell?"

Isabella pouted. "I'm not jealous. I just felt uncomfortable seeing you two so close in the kitchen."

Sebastian, amused and exasperated, said, "I just touched her hand. That's close? If it bothers you, I won't touch her anymore, okay?"

"No!" Isabella bit her lip. "If you don't touch her, the act won't be convincing."

Sebastian put his arm around her waist. "But I'm more afraid of you being upset."

Sebastian's gentle words felt like a soothing touch on her heart. Isabella's heart fluttered, and she suddenly felt her actions were childish and silly.

She lowered her eyes. "It's my fault."

Sebastian pressed his thumb against her lips. "I was wrong. Why are you blaming yourself?"

Sebastian picked Isabella up, carried her to the living room, and placed her on the sofa. Kneeling on one knee on the carpet, Sebastian took Isabella's hand and kissed it. "If you want to go to the hospital, I'll have Jack come get you."

"Okay," Isabella nodded and pulled her hand back. "You should go now. Don't keep Emily waiting."

###chapter 185  Can't Afford to Offend

Sebastian nodded. "Got a social event tonight, so I'll be back late. Don't wait up."

He ruffled Isabella's hair, his eyes full of affection.

Isabella's heart melted. "Okay."

Outside, Emily had been waiting for over ten minutes, lost in thought.

When Sebastian finally came out, she smiled. "Sebastian."

"Let's go," he said, walking briskly.

Emily noticed a smile in his eyes she hadn't seen before.

Isabella had the nutritionist prepare some food for the hospital.

When Jack arrived to pick her up, he looked exhausted, having stayed at the hospital all night.

Isabella saw not just physical fatigue but emotional strain in his eyes.

In the car, she asked, "What's wrong? Is Margaret's condition bad?"

Jack shook his head. "No."

"Then what is it?"

After a pause, Jack said, "Ms. Jose seems to really dislike me."

Isabella was speechless. She wanted to scold him. Kelsey had liked him so much before, but he always ignored her for Nancy. Kelsey, being pampered, couldn't like someone who disregarded her feelings.

Jack didn't say more, and neither did Isabella. It was their business, not hers to interfere.

At the hospital, Jack went up with her.

"Isabella," Kelsey called out, looking more mature overnight.

She gave Jack a brief, indifferent glance, as if he were a stranger.

Jack handed her a bag. "I got you some clothes from your family."

Kelsey took it and thanked him coldly, then pulled Isabella to the ward.

"Isabella, please talk to Nina. She hasn't slept, eaten, or drunk anything. If this keeps up, she'll collapse before mom gets better," Kelsey said, worried.

Isabella saw Nina's alarming condition and shook her head. "I know my sister. If Margaret doesn't wake up, she won't eat."

Just like when Isabella had a high fever as a child, Nina stayed by her side without eating or drinking for three days.

Now, the knife Margaret took for Nina might have shattered her heart. Forcing her to eat wouldn't help.

"What do we do then?" Kelsey asked, eyes red with worry.

Everyone had tried to persuade Nina, but nothing worked.

Isabella thought for a moment and then said, "Maybe Mr. Cole can help."

"Richard?" Kelsey asked, skeptical. "What's his deal with Nina?"

"Friends," Isabella replied. She knew Richard liked Nina, but since Nina hadn't admitted it, she kept quiet.

Kelsey was doubtful. "If you can't persuade her, can Mr. Cole really do it?"

Isabella shook her head. She wasn't sure, but had a gut feeling Richard could help.

Richard showed up in the evening. Nina hadn't moved from Margaret's bedside all day.

When Richard entered the ward, his presence was commanding. He walked up to Nina and pulled her up, steadying her when she stumbled.

"Come with me to get something to eat," he said, not giving her a chance to refuse.

Nina tried to resist, but Richard's strength was too much for her. He paused at the door, addressing everyone in the ward. "I'm taking her for a meal. I'll bring her back soon."

Everyone nodded.

Nina had no choice.

Downstairs, Richard chose a quiet restaurant nearby. He pulled out a chair and pressed Nina down into it.

As soon as he let go, Nina stood up. "I don't want to eat. I want to go back."

Richard grabbed her wrist and pressed her down again. "I haven't had dinner yet."

"Then you eat here."

"You eat with me," Richard insisted. "Nina, you know the consequences of refusing me."

Nina froze, recalling the image of Charlie's eye being shot out with an arrow.

Seeing her hesitate, Richard let go and sat across from her, ordering a few dishes.

He handed her a fork. "Eat."

Nina put down the fork. "I'm sorry, Mr. Cole. I really can't eat."

Richard stared at her, but she didn't pick it up again. "You asked me to have a meal with you, so I will. First, you've been kind to me. For such a small request, I have no reason to refuse. Second, I understand who you are and I can't afford to offend you."

Richard was amused. "Since you know you can't afford to offend me, how dare you show me disrespect?"

Nina looked away. "My mom is in the hospital, her life hanging by a thread. I really can't smile. If you don't like my attitude, I can leave."

Richard was speechless. He irritably squeezed the fork in his hand. "I understand how you feel, so I'll let it slide this time."

He moved his chair and sat right next to her.

###chapter 186  The Verdict

Richard's cold presence surrounded Nina.

He was way too close!

His bent leg touched hers, trapping her between him and the glass.

Just as Nina was about to move, he brought a piece of beef to her lips.

"Open your mouth," Richard ordered, holding a fork.

Nina froze.

Before she could react, he pinched her chin, causing her to open her mouth slightly. He shoved the beef in.

Nina frowned.

As soon as she tasted the beef, he warned, "Spit it out, and I'll pull Mrs. Jose's oxygen tube right now."

Nina stared at him, shocked.

"Don't believe me? Try it," he challenged.

Nina knew he meant it. Richard was ruthless. He had shot out Charlie's eyeball. Killing her would be easy.

She chewed and swallowed the beef.

Richard's tense expression eased a bit, and he offered another piece.

Their interaction had drawn attention.

"I'll eat by myself," Nina said.

Richard didn't respond, just moved his chair back across the table.

Not far away, Kelsey and Isabella had seen everything.

Kelsey exhaled. "Mr. Cole really knows how to handle Nina."

Isabella smiled, taking Kelsey's hand. "Let's head back."

"Yeah, let's go."

They almost bumped into someone as they turned.

It was Michael, Richard's subordinate.

Unlike Richard, Michael had fair skin and sharp features, with a mischievous glint in his eyes.

He crossed his arms, smirking at them. "Following Richard, huh? It's you two."

Kelsey had seen Michael before but didn't know his name.

"What's your name?" she asked, curious.

Michael looked at her disdainfully. "Why should I tell you?"

Kelsey rolled her eyes. "Forget it. Let's go, Bella."

As they walked away, Michael raised an eyebrow, amused. "Interesting."

Later that night, Nina was dozing by the hospital bed when she felt someone touch her hair.

She looked up to see Margaret watching her with the gentlest gaze.

Nina sat up, grabbing Margaret's hand. "Mom?"

Margaret was stunned.

The heart monitor beeped, showing a fast heart rate.

Zaire woke up and called the doctor.

Kelsey and Steven also woke up.

The doctor said Margaret was just emotional, causing her heart rate to spike.

Margaret waking up meant she was out of the critical period.

"Mom," Kelsey cried, rushing over.

Steven and Zaire, too embarrassed to cry, had wet eyes.

Margaret held Kelsey's hand and reached out to Nina.

Nina wiped her tears and took her hand. "Mom, I'm sorry."

A tear slid down Margaret's cheek.

Nina finally mended the rift with the Jose family.

Margaret stayed in the hospital for over a week, with Nina and Kelsey by her side.

When Margaret was discharged, Nina officially moved in with the Jose family.

Seeing this, Isabella felt more touched than sad. She was at peace with Nina reconnecting with her past.

The court's verdict came: Nina and Charlie divorced. Charlie's car and house were confiscated to cover his $80,000 debt.

Raymond got three years in prison.

Charlie was sentenced to death.

Surprisingly, Charlie took all the blame at the last moment.

Vanessa spent five days in detention and came out looking gaunt.

Back at Pine Hill Residences, she soaked in the tub, scrubbing herself thoroughly.

After her bath, she went downstairs to eat. Her phone was filled with news about Charlie, making her nauseous.

She lost her appetite and left the restaurant, still feeling sick.

Holding her chest, she remembered something and headed to the pharmacy.

As expected.

Vanessa stared at the positive pregnancy test, bewildered.

She was pregnant!

It must have happened during those days in the basement with Charlie.

She hadn't taken any precautions.

Vanessa suddenly realized why Charlie took all the blame. He must have known she was pregnant!

She threw the test stick away and pounded her stomach. "I don't want your child! Go to hell!"

But no matter how much she pounded, nothing happened.

She bought two boxes of abortion pills and took them all at once.

In the afternoon, her experienced intense abdominal pain.

Vanessa didn't care and lay on the bed, waiting for the baby to be expelled.

After a nap, the bed was clean, and her pain was gone. The baby was still there!

Unable to stand it, Vanessa grabbed her bag and took a cab to the hospital.

It was too late, and the doctor told her to come back the next day for the procedure.

Vanessa spent the night at a bar, drinking heavily.

The next day, she showed up at the hospital reeking of alcohol.

The doctor shook his head, gave her the surgery consent form, and told her to pay and prepare.

Vanessa staggered out and saw Sebastian at the payment kiosk.

###chapter 187  Climbing Over the Wall at Midnight

Vanessa paused. From a distance, she saw Sebastian paying the fee. He grabbed some forms and headed to the ultrasound room.

Driven by curiosity, Vanessa followed him.

She hid in a corner and watched Sebastian waiting outside the ultrasound room, checking his watch.

Soon, the door opened, and Isabella, in maternity clothes, walked out.

Sebastian immediately went to support her.

They picked up the ultrasound images and smiled at the baby on the screen. Sebastian even took out his phone and snapped a few photos.

As they got closer, Vanessa quickly hid.

Isabella asked, "Why are you taking pictures?"

"To remember this moment," Sebastian said proudly. "And to make Zaire jealous."

Isabella laughed. "What if Zaire jokes that the baby isn't yours?"

"Who cares? Once the baby is born, I'm the dad. If I'm not the biological father, then who is?" Sebastian shrugged and sent the photos to Zaire.

Zaire called right away. "Sebastian, that's too much!"

Sebastian, holding Isabella, smiled. "Don't be too upset. After my baby is born, you can be the godfather."

Zaire replied, "I'll take that seriously! If it's a boy, I'll take him out for fun. If it's a girl..."

Sebastian cut him off, "I already regret it!"

"You..." Zaire tried to continue.

Sebastian didn't want to argue and hung up.

They got on the escalator. Sebastian had one arm around Isabella's waist and gently touched her belly with the other, his eyes full of love.

Isabella looked at him, feeling emotional. "Sebastian, do you really not care where this baby came from?"

Sebastian frowned. "Isabella, once the baby is born, don't tell the baby I'm not the father! Kids are sensitive, and it could hurt them. It would create a rift between us."

Isabella chuckled. "There won't be any rift between you two."

'Because you are the biological father!' Isabella thought.

This made her even more determined not to tell Sebastian the truth for now.

"What are you laughing at?" Sebastian sensed something was off and squinted at her.

"Nothing." Isabella immediately stopped smiling. "It's nothing."

Vanessa stood not far away, watching them leave, her eyes filled with jealousy.

She looked down at the forms in her hand, then threw them in the trash and left the hospital.

Vanessa touched her belly, thinking about other things.

After a while, she smirked. "Fine, Charlie, you win. I'll have this baby. I promise I'll raise him well. Maybe he'll be useful in the future!"

Vanessa walked out of the hospital, and a car stopped in front of her.

Three days later, it was the day of Charlie's execution.

According to the rules, he could say goodbye to his family for five minutes before going to the firing squad location.

But Deborah was already dead, and Raymond was in prison.

Charlie was now left with nothing. Even though he was about to die, no one came to say goodbye.

Charlie sat there, his head drooping. In just a few days, he had become a shell of his former self.

Five minutes flew by, and Charlie was taken to the execution ground.

From that moment, Charlie was gone.

That night, Isabella stayed at the Jose family home.

After chatting with Nina for a bit, she fell into a deep sleep.

Nina, however, couldn't sleep. The later it got, the more awake she felt.

Even though Charlie was dead, she didn't feel any relief.

Since forgiving Margaret, Nina believed no hatred was unsolvable.

Besides, she had once truly liked Charlie.

She had thought she would spend her life with him.

But she never imagined Charlie would end up like this.

A dull thud came from outside the floor-to-ceiling window, like something heavy had fallen.

Then, Nina saw a figure appear.

It was pitch black outside, with only dim moonlight. She couldn't make out his face or clothes.

But somehow, Nina knew it was Richard at first glance!

Nina didn't move.

The room was dark, and Richard couldn't see if she was awake. She thought he might leave after a while.

Suddenly, her phone lit up, illuminating her open eyes.

Nina quickly picked up the phone and saw 'Richard' flashing on the screen, her heart racing.

She was completely exposed.

Afraid of waking Isabella, she hung up. She put on a coat and opened the glass door.

Before she could speak, Richard grabbed her wrist and pulled her over.

Richard smelled of alcohol. He dragged her to the railing and jumped down.

The sudden drop made Nina scream in fear. She clung to Richard's clothes, her whole body pressed against him.

Richard glanced down at her, a faint smile on his lips.

He held her waist and easily leaped over the Jose manor, landing on the road outside.

A car was parked by the roadside. Richard opened the passenger door and shoved Nina inside.

Before she could react, he got into the driver's seat, started the car, and drove away.

The night was vast.

The car sped down the road, heading further into the wilderness.

Even with the car heater was on, Nina felt a chill of fear.

She turned to look at Richard.

Since getting in the car, Richard had been focused on driving, not saying a word.

Seeing Richard pressing the gas pedal with no intention of stopping, Nina finally asked, "Where are you taking me?"

Richard glanced at her briefly and asked, "Scared?"

Nina couldn't quite describe her emotions.

When Richard asked, she didn't feel scared anymore.

Maybe because she knew Richard wouldn't hurt her.

But if she wasn't scared, it didn't seem right either.

After all, Richard looked quite dangerous, and he liked to do things unconventionally, like climbing through windows in the middle of the night to abduct her.

Who knew what he was up to?

Nina didn't speak because she didn't have an answer.

Richard chuckled softly. "Don't worry. I'm in a good mood today. I won't kill you."

Nina's eyelashes trembled.

###chapter 188 Be Your Man

Did Richard sound human?

"Richard talks about killing people like it's as easy as squashing a bug," Nina thought.

"Why so quiet?" Richard asked, clearly interested.

Nina shrank back, feeling a bit intimidated. "Nothing to say."

Richard just smiled and stayed silent.

The car sped along and finally stopped at a dock in the suburbs.

Before getting out, Nina saw a yacht at the pier.

Richard draped his coat over her shoulders and led her onto the yacht.

Nina's grip tightened. "You're not planning to sell me, are you?"

Richard paused. "Even if I wanted to, someone would have to buy."

Nina took a moment to process. Did he mean she wasn't worth anything?

Before she could think more, Richard had already pulled her onto the yacht.

The yacht started and slowly left the shore.

Nina stood on the deck, watching the shore fade away, feeling a mix of panic and fear.

As the boat sailed farther, it slowed down.

Richard let go of her hand. "Wait here," he said, heading into the cabin.

With the yacht slowing down, the sea breeze became gentler. The city's lights shimmered in the distance.

Listening to the sea and the wind, Nina's heart began to calm.

She grabbed the railing and leaned over. The sea below was pitch black.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed her collar and yanked her back.

Nina felt a tightness around her neck, let go of the railing, and fell to the ground.

She looked at Richard, speechless. "What are you doing?"

Richard frowned, looking dark. "I should ask you that. What are you doing?"

"I wasn't doing anything."

Richard stared at her. "I just took you out to sea. Is that such a big deal?"

Nina was stunned.

Richard continued, "Do you know how cold this water is? How deep it is? Even if you don't drown, do you think you can swim back?"

He was angry, not just scolding.

He had never seen anyone as foolish as Nina.

It took Nina a while to react. "You thought I was going to jump?"

Her question caught Richard off guard.

Nina stood up, finding it funny.

Her laughter drifted in the sea breeze, clear and pleasant.

Richard's frown relaxed a bit. He handed her a small porcelain jar.

"What's this?" Nina asked.

"Charlie's ashes," Richard said.

"What!" Nina was startled, her hand shook, and the jar fell.

With a crash, it shattered, spilling a cloud of white powder.

The sea breeze blew it away.

Nina stepped aside, worried the ashes might get on her.

In no time, the wind had almost blown away all the ashes.

"You!" Nina glared at Richard.

Bringing Charlie's ashes here was terrifying!

Richard hadn't expected such a strong reaction. He was momentarily stunned by her actions.

Then he smirked. "He's dead and turned to ashes. Are you still afraid of him?"

Nina was speechless. 'Afraid of him? No, I was afraid of you!'

Richard glanced at the ashes on the ground and said calmly, "Remember when Charlie said if he died, he'd come back from hell to find you?"

Nina was stunned. Of course, she remembered. But she never believed it. Charlie's words were just his final desperate threats.

But Richard seemed to believe it.

"I made this jar myself," Richard said. "It's rough, but the priest said it can calm souls. The patterns were drawn by the priest too. He said if this jar is thrown into the sea, you'll be safe forever."

Richard looked at the ashes on the ground. "But your way is better."

He kicked the fragments and ashes into the sea.

"Now he's completely gone. Even if he could come back, he wouldn't have the power to harm you."

Nina was stunned by Richard's words. She had seen superstitious people, but never someone who believed so deeply.

Maybe it was the sea breeze, but her eyes stung a bit. She blinked and said, "You don't seem like someone who would believe in this."

"Yeah, I don't," Richard nodded. "But for you, I'm willing to believe once."

Nina felt a mix of emotions.

Richard approached her, eyes fixed on her. "Since I started doing business, I knew to eliminate all threats. Even if Charlie's dead, I can't leave any potential dangers."

Nina was frightened by the fierceness in his eyes. The closer Richard got, the more suffocated she felt.

She instinctively took a step back.

Noticing her movement, Richard's eyes tightened. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her close. "You understand why I'm doing this, right?"

Nina shook her head. "I don't understand."

"Nina!"

She avoided Richard's intense gaze, lowered her head, and said, "Mr. Cole, I've always been grateful for what you did last time. In a way, you saved my life."

Richard's grip tightened. "I don't want to be your savior. I want to be your man!"

Nina's heart skipped a beat, and a strong sense of unease and fear grew inside her.

She quickly pulled her hand back. "Mr. Cole, I don't know if I did something to make you misunderstand. If I did, I apologize. I feel nothing but profound gratitude and utmost respect for you."

Richard took a step closer. "I do!"

Nina quickly stepped back. "That's your personal business. Don't push it on me!"

Richard quietly stared at her for a moment, then asked, "So you don't like me?"

###chapter 189  Between Us, It's Just Beginning

Nina didn't hesitate. "Yeah, I don't like you!"

"I don't believe it!" Richard snapped, gritting his teeth. "Say it to my face!"

Nina looked him in the eye. "Mr. Cole, I really don't like you!"

They stared at each other for a moment, the sound of the sea and waves filling the silence.

Suddenly, Richard lunged forward, grabbed Nina, and pinned her against the railing, kissing her forcefully.

Nina struggled, but Richard was too strong, holding her hands with one of his, his body like steel, making it impossible for her to move.

His kiss was as forceful and domineering as he was.

Nina stopped struggling and let him kiss her, but she didn't respond.

When Richard finally let go, he saw the determination in her eyes and was shocked. Realizing what he'd done, he abruptly released her.

Nina stood up straight, fixing her clothes. "Mr. Cole, consider this kiss as repaying your debt. We're even now."

Richard gritted his teeth. "You don't get it. I repay both kindness and hatred. I saved your life with my blood, so now you owe me yours. Either stay with me, or I take your life!"

He grabbed her neck with his left hand, lifting her off the ground.

Nina's breathing weakened, her neck feeling like it might snap.

She didn't struggle, just closed her eyes.

Richard looked at her, almost grinding his teeth to pieces.

In the end, he couldn't kill her.

He let go.

Nina fell to the ground, clutching her chest and gasping for air.

Richard stood over her. "Nina, this is just the beginning for us!"

Nina's heart tightened. When she looked up, he had already walked into the cabin.

After Charlie's incident, things seemed calm.

But Isabella knew a bigger storm was coming for her and Sebastian.

One day, she thought of Vanessa.

Since Charlie died, Vanessa had disappeared.

Thinking of Vanessa made Isabella uneasy.

She told Sebastian about her worries.

Sebastian had Jack investigate Vanessa's whereabouts. They found she had left Lakina and returned home.

Jack's friends found out Vanessa had a job and a boyfriend, and they were planning to get married.

Hearing this, Isabella felt a bit relieved.

"Looks like Vanessa wants a normal life."

Sebastian pulled her close, his fingers brushing through her hair. "That's the smart choice. If Vanessa tries anything, I won't spare her!"

Isabella nodded. "Emma hasn't come to see me. Do you think she will?"

Sebastian said, "She'll come soon."

Isabella had been seeing a lot of news about Sebastian and Charles's business battles lately. Even though it was just numbers, she could imagine the dangers involved. Sebastian's retaliations had hit the Landon family hard, and the father-son relationship between him and Charles seemed completely ruined.

"Sebastian," Emily walked in with some documents. Seeing the two being close, she looked away. "There's a problem in Northhaven. We might need to go there immediately."

Isabella knew they had business to discuss, so she got up from Sebastian's lap. "I'll go upstairs and watch TV. You two talk."

Sebastian squeezed her hand. "Don't watch too long."

"Okay."

Isabella had just gone upstairs when Kelsey called.

"Isabella, are you home?"

"Yeah, I am."

"Great, I'm just passing by. I'll come over to chat."

"Okay."

Not even a minute after hanging up, Kelsey's car drove into the yard.

Isabella saw from upstairs and smiled. "You really were just passing by."

Emily opened the door.

Kelsey was surprised to see her. "Emily, what are you doing here?"

Emily didn't say much, just let her in.

After changing shoes and entering, Kelsey saw Sebastian sitting in the living room, frowning at a pile of documents.

"Sebastian, I'm here to see Isabella," Kelsey said.

Sebastian looked up. "She's upstairs."

"Okay." Kelsey nodded, her eyes darting between him and Emily before heading upstairs.

As soon as Kelsey reached the second floor, she heard Emily's voice.

"Sebastian, look at this."

Kelsey paused and looked back.

Sebastian was sitting on the sofa, and Emily, holding documents, was squatting in front of him. From Kelsey's angle, they seemed quite close.

Kelsey pursed her lips and ran to find Isabella.

"Isabella!"

Isabella was startled. "Why are you out of breath?"

Kelsey grabbed her hand. "Come with me."

Isabella didn't have time to ask before being dragged out of the room.

Kelsey pulled her to the staircase, and they squatted there. Kelsey pointed downstairs. "Look."

Isabella saw Sebastian and Emily sitting on the sofa, discussing business.

"What's wrong?" Isabella looked for a while and didn't find anything strange.

Kelsey said, "What's with Emily? Why is she at your house and so close to Sebastian?"

"She's an employee of the Landon Group now. I'm pregnant, so I can't go to the company. Emily went instead."

Kelsey blinked.

Because of family matters, Kelsey had taken half a month off and hadn't been to the Landon Group, so she didn't know about Emily.

Now that she knew, she was quite surprised. "You actually agreed?"

Isabella nodded. "Yeah. Why wouldn't I?"

Kelsey pulled her back to the bedroom. "Isabella, do you know that Emily..."

"What about her?"

Kelsey sighed, her tone slowing down. "Back when I was in high school, my brother and Sebastian were in college. Emily was two years ahead of me. She was Susan's relative, raised by the Anderson family. Calling her a relative sounds nice. In the Anderson family, except for Susan and Kevin, no one else is treated well. If Leo, a legitimate son, is treated like that, how do you think Emily is treated? She was basically Susan's follower."

###chapter 190 Be Careful

"Emily follows Susan everywhere. It's been like that since they were kids. In school, Emily would get lunch for her and even tie her shoelaces. She was like a nanny. When Susan was going to study abroad, Henry didn't want her to go alone, so he sent Emily with her."

Hearing this, Isabella thought of Susan's arrogance and said, "Emily's got it rough."

"That's not the whole story," Kelsey said. "When they were applying to colleges, Emily didn't get in, but Susan, who always had bad grades, got into a top university. At the Anderson family banquet, everyone drank a lot and stayed over. Someone saw Emily coming out of Sebastian's room in the middle of the night, and rumors started."

Kelsey watched Isabella's reaction. "My brother asked Sebastian about it, but he didn't confirm or deny anything. One Christmas, I saw Sebastian and Emily walking together with friends. Since then, people said they were a couple."

"And then?" Isabella was intrigued.

"Then Susan went abroad, and Emily went with her."

"That's it?"

"That's it."

Isabella said, "That doesn't prove anything. If Sebastian doesn't admit it, it didn't happen."

"True," Kelsey said, worried. "But aren't you afraid old feelings might come back?"

Isabella was surprised, then laughed. "I never thought about that."

Seeing Emily and Sebastian together had made her uneasy and jealous. But she had realized they hadn't done anything wrong. She trusted Sebastian and didn't think Emily was that bad. Gradually, she stopped worrying.

Maybe because of recent experiences, Isabella stayed calm hearing Kelsey's stories.

"Anyway, keep an eye out," Kelsey advised, still uneasy.

Because of Kelsey's words, Isabella felt a bit suspicious when she saw Sebastian.

That night, after they were intimate, Sebastian held her as they fell asleep. But Isabella couldn't sleep.

She finally spoke up. "Sebastian?"

Sebastian, half-asleep, responded groggily.

"Kelsey told me some things about you and Emily."

Sebastian's breathing was heavy. Just when Isabella thought he was asleep, Sebastian moved and kissed her hair lightly. "If you want to know something, ask me directly. I'll tell you everything."

Isabella lifted her head. "You'll tell me everything?"

"Yes." Sebastian looked at her tenderly.

Isabella said, "Now that you say that, I don't want to ask anymore."

"Why?" Sebastian held her tighter, his cheek brushing her ear, tickling her. "Not interested in my past?"

Isabella said, "I was curious after hearing Kelsey. But since you're so straightforward, I believe there's nothing between you and Emily."

Sebastian chuckled. "But I still want to tell you."

Isabella wrapped her arms around his neck. "I'd love to listen."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Didn't you say you didn't want to ask?"

"Whether I want to ask is one thing. Whether you want to tell is another. The best relationships are where you share without being asked."

Sebastian chuckled. "Didn't know you were a philosopher, Bella."

Isabella nudged him. "Come on, spill it."

"Alright." Sebastian's eyes softened. He ran his fingers through her hair and began recounting the past.

It was Susan's graduation banquet. The place was packed, and the air reeked of alcohol. Young Sebastian was in a foul mood after a big argument with Charles and had a few too many drinks.

A servant took him upstairs to rest, and he ran into Susan and Emily at the corner. Susan was furious, kicking and cursing at Emily, even tearing her dress. Emily just stood there, head down, silent.

Sebastian didn't want to get involved, but he saw a bit of himself in Emily. So he stepped in.

"Sebastian?" Susan stopped immediately, her anger replaced by a sweet demeanor. The dispute ended just like that.

Sebastian went to his room to rest later. In the middle of the night, he felt someone crawl into his bed-a cold, trembling body. Startled, he pushed the person away and turned on the lights. Emily stood up shakily from the floor, crying.

She revealed that Susan had taken her grades. Emily was the one who got into the top university, but Susan took credit, ruining Emily's chance to escape. Emily started undressing, begging Sebastian to take her away, willing to trade her body for it.

Sebastian refused and kicked her out of the room.

"So you didn't deny the rumors to protect Emily?" Isabella asked.

Sebastian shook his head. "I didn't confirm or deny anything. If it happened, it happened. She needed a shield, and it wasn't a big deal for me, so I let them think what they wanted."

Isabella looked at him with admiration. "You're too good, Mr. Landon."

Sebastian lowered his head, nibbling on her lips. "It was nothing. I was just afraid telling you would make you uncomfortable. There's nothing between me and her."

"I know," Isabella nodded. "I believe you."

"Good."

With her doubts cleared, Isabella finally felt at ease. "Alright, let's sleep."

Sebastian turned over, holding her chin and shaking it gently. "I can't sleep now."

Isabella opened her eyes. "Hmm?"

Feeling the change in his lower body, Isabella's eyes widened. "Didn't we just do it?"

Sebastian laughed and pecked her lips. "You know your husband's stamina."

With that, he pulled the blanket over their heads.

Under the blanket, Isabella's voice pleaded, "Sebastian, stop."

###chapter 191 The World is a Circle

In no time, Isabella was over seven months pregnant.

As Isabella's belly grew like a balloon, Sebastian got busier and busier.

Sebastian left early this morning.

Isabella had just finished breakfast when Nina showed up.

They had planned to go to the mall to check out baby stuff today.

On a whim, Isabella had chatted with Miley and decided to turn a room into a nursery.

Sebastian was too busy to care, so Isabella took charge.

She wanted her child to be the happiest in the world.

She'd make sure her baby felt secure and protected.

Maybe it was her maternal instinct; Isabella loved everything at the baby store.

The baby products were small, cute, and just her style.

She was having a blast, but Nina seemed uneasy. "How's Sebastian treating you lately?"

"Great. We're doing fine," Isabella replied.

Nina pulled her aside, looking serious. "But he doesn't even have time to shop with you. I've been the one going to your check-ups! Is he really that busy? He wasn't before."

"There's a lot going on at work. I get it," Isabella said, then dragged Nina to look at cradles.

"I don't want to look," Nina said.

Nina wandered off to check out mother care products instead.

In the end, Isabella picked out a basket of baby stuff.

Nina got two baskets of mother care items.

"You're only thinking about the baby. What about you? The baby will have someone to care for him, but you need care too."

Isabella clung to Nina's arm, rubbing her shoulder. "As long as I have you, I'm cared for."

Nina couldn't resist Isabella's charm. Whenever Isabella acted cute, all her anger vanished.

"That'll be twelve thousand dollars," the cashier said.

"I'll pay," Nina insisted.

As Miss Jose, she didn't need to work and had no money worries.

Despite her frugal upbringing, Nina never skimped when it came to Isabella.

Even if it were one hundred and twenty thousand dollars, she'd pay without hesitation.

After Isabella filled out the address, the store staff packed everything for home delivery.

"Oh, having a rich sister is really nice," Isabella sighed as they left the store.

Nina retorted, "So I'm only nice when I'm rich, and not nice when I'm not?"

"Of course not. You're a good sister whether you're rich or not," Isabella said. "I'll never forget you. I love you the most."

Nina cringed, "So cheesy."

As they joked, Nina suddenly looked up and froze. "Is that Sebastian?"

Isabella was startled too.

When she looked up, she saw two figures disappearing around the corner on the fourth floor.

Even from a glance, she could tell it was Sebastian and Emily.

Before Isabella could say anything, Nina was already pulling her towards the escalator. "Let's go check it out."

Isabella quickly stopped her. "Nina, it's not Sebastian. You must've seen wrong. He has a meeting today. How could he be here now?"

"Really?" Nina was skeptical but let it go.

Worried about running into them again, Isabella pulled Nina in the opposite direction.

But after half a lap, they still ran into Sebastian and Emily.

And this time, it was face-to-face.

Emily was holding a designer bag, and her clothes had changed from earlier.

The four of them stood there, and Isabella was stunned.

How could she forget?

'The world is round! And so is this mall!'"Isabella thought.

"Isabella?" Emily was surprised, then smiled. "What a coincidence, are you shopping?"

Isabella forced a smile. "Yes."

Nina turned to her, her gaze saying, "You can still smile?"

Isabella was speechless.

In this situation, she didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Sebastian walked over and took Isabella's hand. "What did you buy?"

"Oh, some mother and baby products, a cradle, and some toys," Isabella said, noticing Nina's displeased expression and not daring to say more.

Emily walked over and extended her hand to Nina. "Hello, Nina. I'm Emily. I was at the Jose family reunion dinner last time, but something unexpected happened, and I didn't get a chance to greet you."

Nina didn't extend her hand, just looked at Sebastian. "Isabella said you had work today, so she asked me to come with her to pick out baby products. I didn't expect to run into you here. Quite a coincidence."

Emily awkwardly withdrew her hand and stood aside.

Sebastian explained, "We just finished a meeting, and Ms. Lopez's clothes got dirty. We passed by here, so I accompanied her to buy a new set."

Isabella nodded quickly. "I understand. It's fine."

As soon as she finished speaking, Nina shot her a sharp look.

Isabella quickly shut up.

Emily's phone rang. She answered it, said a few words, then hung up and said to Sebastian, "Mr. Landon, we have a lunch appointment in half an hour. We should go."

"Okay," Sebastian nodded.

Before he could say anything, Isabella urged him. "You should go. Don't be late."

Sebastian and Emily left.

Nina turned to Isabella, who was still waving. "Are you stupid?"

"Huh?"

"Can't you see that woman is interested in Sebastian?"

Isabella scratched her head. "Nina, I know about their situation. Don't misunderstand."

Nina shook her head. "Bella, I've been around. I'm only a few years older than you, but I've worked for many years and I'm good at reading people. That Emily's look is very suspicious."

Isabella asked, "What about Sebastian? Is he suspicious?"

Nina hesitated. "He's not, but he can't resist if Emily keeps pestering him. Men are all the same."

"Okay, I know what I'm doing."

Back home, Isabella started setting up the nursery.

Since she didn't know if the baby was a boy or a girl, she chose neutral-colored baby products, mostly white and black. She didn't buy any pink or blue items.

Halfway through setting up, the doorbell rang.

Isabella went downstairs to open the door and was stunned to see who was standing there.

"Aunt Emma?"

###chapter 192  He Is a Demon on Earth

Sebastian was right; Emma really showed up.

Even though she was ready, Isabella still felt a bit nervous and couldn't quite believe it.

Her grip on the doorknob tightened.

Emma, holding a fancy bag and looking as elegant as ever, seemed to have moved on from Matthew's imprisonment.

"Isabella, long time no see."

Isabella suddenly wanted to shut the door on her.

But she remembered Sebastian's instructions and held back.

"Aunt Emma." She forced a stiff smile. "What brings you here?"

"I've been meaning to visit but never got the chance." Emma's face was calm. "Not inviting me in?"

Isabella snapped out of it. "Oh, please come in."

She let Emma in, poured her a glass of water, and brought out some snacks.

Emma said, "Don't trouble yourself. Sit and chat with me?"

Isabella nodded and sat down.

Emma's eyes went to her belly. "You're almost eight months along, right?"

Isabella was surprised Emma remembered. She protectively placed her hand over her belly. "Yes, almost eight months."

"Time flies." Emma sighed.

Isabella tried to steer the conversation. "What brings you here today?"

Emma handed her the bag. "A gift for you and the baby."

"Thank you." Isabella accepted it, softly thanking her.

Suddenly, Emma grabbed her hand tightly, startling her.

"Bella, is the baby Sebastian's?"

Panic flashed through Isabella. She shook her head. "No, it's not his."

Emma smiled. "Can he really accept and treat this child as his own?"

Isabella didn't know how to answer.

She believed Sebastian could, but Emma's question threw her off.

Her silence seemed like an admission to Emma.

"Bella, do you know Sebastian has a woman on the side?"

Isabella knew.

Sebastian had been seen with Emily, but she knew it was all an act.

In front of Emma, she had to play along.

So Isabella pretended to be shocked. "Impossible! I know you hate him and me. But Aunt Emma, I believe in Sebastian. He wouldn't betray me!"

"Really?" Emma sneered. "Then come with me and see."

"See what?"

"See the evidence of his affair!"

Isabella panicked and shook her head. "I believe in Sebastian! No matter what you say, I won't believe it."

Emma looked at her. "Isabella, you say you believe him, but you won't come with me. How much is your belief worth?"

Isabella stayed silent.

She couldn't let Emma sway her.

She was just waiting for the right moment to give Emma the envelope in the study drawer, as Sebastian instructed.

As long as everything went according to plan, there'd be no problem.

No matter what Emma said, Isabella had to stick to one principle: believe in Sebastian!

Isabella stood up. "You should leave."

Emma stood up too. She didn't push the evidence angle but said, "Open the gift. You'll like it."

Isabella hesitated, eyeing the gift box on the coffee table.

It felt like it might explode the moment she opened it.

But she doubted Emma would go that far.

After a pause, Isabella pulled the ribbon. The box opened like a flower, revealing a tablet.

The screen was on, showing a video.

No, it was live surveillance footage!

The timestamp in the corner ticked away, showing it was live.

The camera faced a round bed covered in rose petals, with flickering candles nearby.

A few seconds later, there was a sound.

A man and a woman, kissing, entered the frame.

Isabella recognized them: Sebastian and Emily.

They were wearing the same clothes she saw them in at the mall that morning.

As they kissed and moved to the bed, their clothes came off.

Sebastian pushed Emily onto the bed, his face clearly visible to the camera. It was definitely Sebastian!

Then, things got explicit.

Every frame felt like a stab to Isabella's heart.

If it was an act, it was too convincing.

Under her gaze, Sebastian and Emily were already fully engaged.

"Do you see?" Emma's voice cut in. "This is the Sebastian you believe in!"

Isabella stood there, speechless.

Emma walked over, lightly resting her fingers on Isabella's shoulder. "Bella, you don't understand Sebastian at all. I used to think he was a good person too, but he's a master of deception. Underneath, he's rotten. Sebastian grew up in hatred. How could he be healthy?"

"He hates his father, hates me, hates Matthew. This hatred festers. He even hates our pets and plants. Anything related to us, he wants to destroy. Bella, because of your connection to Matthew, Sebastian will do anything to take you away. Hurting Matthew hurts me and his father," she further explained.

"This is his revenge! Bella, you shouldn't be caught in this. I don't want to see you fall into the abyss." the middle-aged woman pleaded. "Leave Sebastian! He's a demon, not worth your love. I'm begging you!"

Emma's words cut deep.

Isabella suddenly pushed Emma away, covered her ears, and screamed, "Stop it!"

The footage on the tablet continued.

Isabella looked away but could still hear the sounds.

She looked at Emma. "Didn't you say you'd take me to see the evidence? I don't believe this. I want to see it in person!"

Emma immediately agreed. "Alright, I'll take you there right now!"

###chapter 193  He Is Indeed Here

The car cruised down the road with Isabella and Emma in the back seat.

Emma handed Isabella a cup of water. "Bella, if this turns out to be true, what will you do?"

Isabella had no idea.

She didn't know what to do.

Honestly, she didn't believe Emma at all.

Or the surveillance footage on the tablet.

'Anything can be faked,' Isabella thought.

She knew Emma had bad intentions but still got in the car to expose her lies.

But if the footage was real, then what?

Isabella's mind was a mess.

"Can I make a call?" Isabella asked, pulling out her phone.

Emma nodded. "Go ahead."

Isabella unlocked her phone, found Sebastian's number, and her hand shook as she dialed.

She didn't want Emma to see her emotions, so she put the phone to her ear and looked out the window.

The wait felt endless.

"Sorry, the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."

Isabella hung up and tried again.

Same result.

Sebastian's phone was always unanswered.

By now, the car had entered an estate.

The place was lit up, with luxury cars everywhere.

Isabella immediately spotted Sebastian's car parked across.

Her heart skipped a beat. Was he really here?

"Let's go," Emma said.

Isabella hesitated but followed.

They took the elevator upstairs.

The corridor lighting was dim, making Isabella feel uneasy.

After stepping out of the elevator, she stopped.

Emma walked to a door and used a room card. After two beeps, the lock turned.

Emma didn't open the door but looked at Isabella. "Bella, push this door open to see the truth. It's your choice. If you want to know, open it. If not, I'll take you back."

Isabella stood still for a long time.

Emma waited patiently.

Suddenly, Isabella shook her head and stepped back.

Emma's eyes widened. "Isabella!"

Isabella chose to back out!

She didn't have the courage to open the door.

She wanted to run!

Isabella turned and frantically pressed the elevator button.

Emma didn't stop her, just sighed and shook her head.

The elevator finally arrived, and Isabella rushed in as soon as the doors opened.

"Bella?" The person inside was about to step out and was surprised to see her.

Isabella froze at the voice. She looked up and saw Nina. "Nina?"

Nina stepped out, concerned. "What's wrong? You look so pale."

Isabella shook her head. "I'm not feeling well. I want to go back."

"But..." Nina started to say but then saw Emma.

Nina was stunned. "Mrs. Landon?"

She didn't understand why Isabella and Emma were together.

Just as Nina was about to ask, the door suddenly opened from the inside.

Emily, wearing just a camisole, walked out. When she saw everyone in the corridor, she froze.

She stood there for a few seconds, then quickly stepped back and slammed the door shut.

Nina was stunned too.

She turned sharply to Isabella, her eyes full of emotion.

Isabella's body swayed. The moment Emily appeared, her mind went blank.

Her legs felt weak, and she could barely stand.

Nina supported her, gritting her teeth. "What the hell is going on?"

Isabella couldn't answer.

Emma said, "Sebastian and Emily are meeting here secretly. I brought Bella because I couldn't stand seeing her deceived."

Nina's eyes widened. "You mean Sebastian is in that room too?"

She immediately denied it, "That's impossible. Sebastian isn't like that!"

Just then, the door of the next room opened, and a disheveled man walked out.

It was Zaire!

Zaire opened the door and was stunned to see Nina and Isabella.

Then, a woman hugged his waist from behind. "Zaire, don't leave me."

It was Susan!

Both were disheveled, and Susan was in her underwear.

Zaire's shirt was slightly open, with scratch marks all over his body.

Susan had marks on her neck and chest.

Zaire pulled Susan's hand away and walked out quickly. "Nina, Isabella, you..."

When Zaire saw Emma, he stopped abruptly.

A trace of hostility appeared in Zaire's eyes. "It's you?"

"Zaire, what the hell is going on?" Nina was so anxious her eyes turned red. Seeing him and Susan like this, she could almost imagine what was happening in the next room with Emily and Sebastian.

Nina turned to Isabella. "Bella, you stay here. I'll check for you."

She let go of Isabella's hand, but Isabella grabbed her again.

Isabella said, "I'll go myself."

She took a step towards the closed door.

Isabella took the room card from Emma and unlocked the door.

She bit her lip and gently pushed it open.

She walked in.

Emily had put on her clothes, but her hair was still messy.

Sebastian was lying on the bed, his upper body bare, covered by a blanket.

When Isabella walked in, Sebastian was already awake. He propped himself up on his arm. When he saw Emily and everything in the room, his heart sank.

"Bella." Sebastian reached out to grab Isabella's hand.

Isabella stepped back, avoiding him.

She looked around: the round bed, rose petals on the sheets, and candles on the nightstand.

Everything matched the surveillance footage.

"Bella, listen to me." Sebastian tried to get up, but dizziness hit him, making him fall back heavily.

Isabella's heart tightened, and she instinctively wanted to step forward.

But before she could move, Emily had already gone over.

Emily supported Sebastian, looking guilty. "I'm sorry, Isabella. I don't know why this happened."

Sebastian pushed her away, angry. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

"Sebastian." Emily looked hurt and scared, biting her lip hard.

At that moment, Sebastian noticed the bloodstains on the sheets.

Isabella saw them too.

A small patch of blood was already dried and solidified.

###chapter 194  Bleeding

Sebastian stared at Emily, shocked. "You!"

Emily blushed, avoiding his eyes. "It's my first time."

Sebastian had a pounding headache, holding his temples, unable to remember anything.

Isabella turned and walked out of the room.

"Bella," Nina called, approaching her.

When Isabella had entered earlier, no one followed her in.

Seeing her come out now, Nina immediately asked, "Is Sebastian inside?"

Isabella shook her head, looking pale. She tightly grasped Nina's hand, feeling dizzy.

"Nina, I feel awful."

Nina saw how bad Isabella looked and got scared. She supported her with both hands. "Where do you feel awful? Can you stand?"

"Stomach pain," Isabella said, then fainted.

Nina, being a woman, couldn't hold her up.

Luckily, Zaire reacted quickly and caught Isabella in time.

Susan suddenly screamed, pointing to where Isabella had been standing. "Blood, she's bleeding!"

Nina was stunned. Looking down, she saw a pool of blood on the carpet and blood streaks between Isabella's legs.

Zaire hurriedly carried her downstairs.

Emma was already waiting by the car, the door open. She said, "Take my car!"

Zaire knew she had ulterior motives, so he started walking forward.

Nina grabbed him. "Where are you going?"

Zaire explained, "Nina, my car is up ahead."

Nina looked ahead. The parking lot was large and long. Zaire said it was up ahead, but Nina couldn't see his car.

She could wait, but Isabella couldn't!

Nina said, "We'll take Mrs. Landon's car!"

"Nina!"

"Hurry!" Nina's eyes were already red.

She wouldn't let anything happen to Isabella or the baby!

Zaire gritted his teeth and put Isabella in Emma's car.

With him accompanying, Emma wouldn't dare do anything.

But as soon as he put Isabella down, Nina pulled him. "You get out."

Zaire explained, "I'll go with you!"

Nina, with a cold face, said, "You go drag Sebastian to the hospital for me. He's the father; he needs to be there!"

Isabella's condition was not looking good. Although she was eight months along, bleeding was never a good sign.

At a time like this, Sebastian indeed needed to be there.

"Okay." Zaire nodded and got out of the car.

He exchanged a glance with Emma, frowning. "Mrs. Landon, you should know how important Isabella is!"

Emma also frowned, coldly saying, "The one who did the disgraceful thing was Sebastian. The one who wronged Isabella was also him. You should be saying this to him!"

With that, Emma got in the car and instructed the driver, "Drive to the hospital, quickly!"

The car sped away, the red taillights quickly disappearing at the end of the winding road.

Zaire stared into the night, gritted his teeth, and turned to stride upstairs.

The room was still a mess. Sebastian had put on his clothes but couldn't muster any strength.

"Sebastian," Emily reached out to support him.

"Get away!" Sebastian pushed her away harshly, feeling uncomfortable and nauseous.

Seeing him angry, Emily didn't dare approach again.

Susan stood at the door, watching the scene with a smile. "Congrats, Emily, your dream came true."

Emily, full of resentment, walked up and slapped Susan.

Susan was stunned, covering her cheek. "Emily, are you crazy?"

"Susan, why harm Sebastian?"

"What nonsense are you talking about?"

"Do you dare say tonight wasn't your plan? If you hadn't spiked the drinks, how could this happen?" Emily's words were sharp.

Sebastian's eyes, filled with anger, locked onto Susan.

Susan was about to speak when Zaire returned, having heard Emily. He gave Susan a reproachful look but said nothing, walking past her.

"Zaire," Susan grabbed his arm. "Don't listen to her. I didn't do it."

Zaire glanced sideways. "Whether you did or not, I'll find out."

He coldly pulled his hand back and helped Sebastian to the bathroom, using cold water to ease his discomfort.

Sebastian grabbed his arm. "Where's Bella?"

"Sent to the hospital." Zaire turned off the shower. "Feel better now?"

"Yeah." Sebastian, soaking wet, grabbed his car keys and strode out.

"Zaire," Susan tried to follow, but Zaire's glare stopped her.

"Don't follow!" His eyes were full of anger, so Susan didn't dare move.

Watching them take the elevator down, Susan, full of anger, slapped Emily.

"I told you to stop talking nonsense!"

Emily, holding her face, sneered. "Whether I'm talking nonsense, Zaire will find out. Susan, if I were you, I'd destroy the evidence immediately. Otherwise, when Zaire finds out, you won't be able to explain yourself."

"You dare talk nonsense again, I'll tear your mouth apart!" Susan screamed and lunged.

But this time, Emily fought back, grabbing Susan's hand mid-air.

Susan was stunned, her eyes wide. How did Emily become so unfamiliar?

"Susan, this is the last time. If you hit me again, I'll return it tenfold!" Emily said, then harshly pushed her hand away and walked off.

Susan was scared. Although she hadn't planed what happend today, she felt it would be pinned on her.

She thought it over and called Leo.

"Hello," Leo's voice was lazy.

"Leo, I don't care where you are. Be here in ten minutes!"

"What's wrong? What happened?"

"Don't ask! Just come!"

Leo was silent for a moment, then said, "Sorry, I'm busy. I can't help you."

Susan was stunned, then her anger surged. "Leo!"

Leo hung up. When Susan called again, he didn't answer.

Susan didn't understand what was going on tonight. First, Emily, who had never resisted, fought back. Then Leo, who had always cleaned up her messes, refused!

Susan was like a headless chicken, panicking. Just then, a call came in.

Seeing the caller ID, Susan's eyes welled up. Answering the call, she was already crying, "Help me!"

###chapter 195 Accident

Isabella was sweating buckets from the pain in the car.

"Bella, Bella," Nina kept calling, her voice shaky.

Inside the car, there was a faint floral scent in the air.

Nina sniffed it and felt dizzy and nauseous.

After a bit, she couldn't hold back and asked, "Mrs. Landon, what incense is that?"

Emma replied, "Just regular . Why?"

"It stinks," Nina said, reaching to open the window for fresh air.

Suddenly, blinding headlights flashed ahead, and a deafening horn blared.

The next second, there was a loud crash.

Nina felt the world flip, something heavy hit her head, and she blacked out.

The car stopped by the roadside.

"Mrs. Landon!" The driver was still in shock.

Emma held a wooden stick; she had seized the chance of the driver's abrupt turn and brake to strike Nina on the neck.

Emma tossed the stick and firmly told the driver, "Quick, stage the scene!"

Zaire drove away from the estate.

Sebastian sat in the passenger seat, soaking wet, staring ahead. "How could you let Bella get in her car?"

"I had no choice," Zaire said. "Don't worry. Emma can't cause much trouble. Plus, Nina's there; nothing will happen."

Zaire made sense, but Sebastian still felt a burning anger.

"We must find out what happened tonight!" Sebastian said sternly.

"We will," Zaire paused, then asked, "Sebastian, did you..."

"No!" Sebastian cut him off. "I didn't touch Emily!"

Zaire glanced at him. "Are you sure?"

'In that situation, people lose their minds!' Zaire thought.

Even he had touched Susan.

And Sebastian's reaction to the drugs was much stronger.

It was hard to believe Sebastian wouldn't lose control.

Sebastian met his gaze, eyes like ice. "I know my body. If I had touched a woman, wouldn't I know?"

If Sebastian had touched Emily, the drug's effects wouldn't be so severe. Even now, he felt terrible.

"But," Zaire started.

Sebastian coldly said, "I'm not you; I have no feelings for Emily!"

Zaire shut his mouth.

He had feelings for Susan, so the drugs had affected him easily.

If it had been someone else, would he have still succumbed?

Sebastian had no feelings for Emily, so even in extreme unconsciousness, he couldn't have done anything to her.

As they talked, the car turned a sharp corner. A few hundred feet ahead, a bright fire appeared.

Both of their pupils contracted, and Sebastian sat up straight, tense like a drawn bow, the firelight reflecting in his eyes.

"It's the Landon family's car!" As they got closer, Zaire recognized it.

He slammed on the brakes, bringing the car to a screeching halt by the roadside, the tires almost smoking.

Before the car fully stopped, Sebastian had already jumped out.

Sebastian stumbled, his knee hitting the gravel hard.

Gritting his teeth, Sebastian got to his feet and walked towards the road.

The car fire was raging, making it hard to get close. A few people were lying on the ground nearby.

Emma sat up from the ground, covered in injuries, staring blankly at the burning car.

Next to her lay the still-unconscious Nina.

Suddenly, Sebastian grabbed Emma by the collar and lifted her. "Where's Bella?"

Emma looked at him, then smiled and pointed at the burning car.

Sebastian followed her finger and saw a human-like figure in the flames.

He was stunned.

He dropped Emma and walked towards the car.

Zaire grabbed him from behind. "Sebastian, calm down. If you go now, you'll die!"

Sebastian gritted his teeth, shook off Zaire's hand, and kept moving forward.

"Sebastian!" Zaire held him back tightly.

Ambulances and fire trucks could be heard approaching.

Nina was carried into an ambulance.

"Zaire, let go of me!" Sebastian's hands were tense, his eyes bloodshot, leaning forward, ready to rush into the flames.

Sebastian had lost his usual composure.

Zaire couldn't let go; it would be sending Sebastian to his death!

Firefighters had just opened the hose when a massive explosion rocked the area.

Zaire tried to pull Sebastian down, but Sebastian stood firm, unblinking.

In the explosion's light, Sebastian thought he saw Isabella in the flames, walking forward.

"Bella!" Sebastian shouted.

She seemed to hear him, turned, smiled, and waved.

Then she fell into the fire.

Sebastian reached out, veins bulging, face filled with grief.

"Bella!" Sebastian screamed, spat out blood, and collapsed.

"Sebastian!"

Emily, who had just arrived, saw this and her heart skipped a beat. She looked at the fire, her fingers clenching tightly.

Emma was placed on a stretcher. As she was pushed past Emily, their eyes met, and Emily's gaze deepened.

Isabella woke up from the pain.

She opened her eyes, the bright light stinging.

She tried to raise her hands to shield her eyes but found her hands and feet tied.

A voice beside her said, "Ms. Miller, you're in danger. We've got consent from your family for a C-section."

C-section, a term Isabella had heard often since becoming pregnant.

She knew it was a standard procedure.

Isabella nodded and fell unconscious again.

She woke up from a bed.

However, she were neither in a hospital nor at home with Sebastian.

It was an unfamiliar place, with the splash of waves faintly heard through the half-drawn curtains.

Isabella saw a photo of Matthew on the wall.

Her heart skipped a beat, and she tried to sit up, pulling at the wound on her belly, breaking out in a cold sweat. She managed to sit halfway up before falling back heavily.

She almost fainted from the pain again.

###chapter 196  Where is the Child?

Isabella lay on the pillow, struggling to breathe, feeling like she was in hell from the pain.

The door opened, and a masked woman pushed in a food cart.

She moved slowly, eyes downcast. Even at the bedside, she didn't look at Isabella.

But Isabella knew her right away.

"Samantha?"

Samantha didn't react. She just placed the food and water on the bedside table, moving like a robot.

Isabella grabbed her arm. "Samantha, is it you?"

No response.

"Where am I? Why are you here? What happened? Where's my child?"

Isabella had a million questions, but Samantha acted like she couldn't hear, ignoring her completely.

After setting the food and water, Samantha sat down and started feeding Isabella.

She was like a machine, no emotion at all.

Isabella turned her head away.

How could she eat now?

"Samantha, say something." Then Isabella remembered Samantha's tongue had been cut out. She was mute.

"You can't talk, but you can gesture or write it down for me." Isabella looked at her hopefully.

But Samantha just kept feeding her, eyes empty, like a doll.

After a few minutes, seeing Isabella wouldn't eat, Samantha put the food away and pushed the cart out.

"Samantha!"

No matter how many times Isabella called, Samantha never stopped or looked back.

The door closed, leaving Isabella alone in the big, empty room.

It was eerily quiet.

Isabella's hand moved to her abdomen, now empty, with only a deep scar left.

Her child, where was her child?

Hospital.

When Nina woke up, she saw Margaret and Kelsey.

"Nina."

"Nina, you're finally awake!"

Nina felt groggy. "What happened to me? Why am I in the hospital?"

Margaret and Kelsey exchanged a sad, complicated look.

Nina suddenly remembered Isabella and last night. "Where's Bella? How is she? Did she have the baby? Boy or girl?"

Margaret's eyes filled with tears.

She turned away to wipe them.

Kelsey choked up. "Nina."

"What is it?" Nina felt a deep unease. "Did something happen to the baby?"

Kelsey shook her head but couldn't speak.

"Then what? Does Sebastian not like the baby?"

Kelsey shook her head, voice breaking. "Nina, that was three days ago."

"Three days ago?" Nina was stunned. "It was just last night!"

"It really has been three days. You've been unconscious for three days!" Kelsey's tears fell, and she quickly wiped them away. "The doctor said you had a concussion and almost didn't wake up!"

Nina frowned. "Really?"

But she didn't care about herself. She was only worried about Isabella. She grabbed Kelsey's hand. "How is Bella?"

Kelsey avoided her gaze, just crying harder.

"Why are you crying?" Nina's voice rose. "Did something happen to Bella?"

Kelsey bit her lip. "Isabella, she..."

Just then, the door opened.

Zaire walked in. He'd been waiting outside, listening. He knew Margaret and Kelsey couldn't say it, so he had to.

Zaire walked to the bedside. "Nina, brace yourself."

Nina forced a smile. "Why are you all so serious? If the baby is gone, it's gone. I just want Bella to be safe!"

Zaire, who never avoided anyone's gaze, couldn't look at Nina now. He lowered his head. "Isabella is dead."

Nina froze, sitting there in shock, silent for a long time.

"Nina." Kelsey hugged her, crying harder.

Nina pushed her away, speaking calmly. "I don't believe it. You must be lying. Bella must have asked you to trick me. It's some kind of surprise, right? Bella loves surprising me."

She got out of bed. "Where is she? I want to see her and the baby."

"Nina, you're still in treatment."

Ignoring this, Nina pulled out her IV, not caring about the bleeding, and walked out.

"Nina, you haven't put on your shoes!" Kelsey grabbed the shoes and chased after her.

As soon as Nina stepped out, two bodyguards stopped her. Zaire had arranged for them, fearing she'd run off.

When Nina struggled, Zaire walked over. "Nina, put on your shoes first. I'll take you to see her."

The elevator descended to the third basement level. When the doors opened, a chilling cold air hit them.

The word "Morgue" glowed in a ghastly red, sending shivers down their spines.

Nina had done many jobs, including working as a hospital attendant. She was most afraid of the morgue.

But today, she felt no fear.

At the door, Jack was standing guard. "Mr. Jose."

Zaire glanced inside. "Is Sebastian still in there?"

Jack nodded, the gesture heavy with meaning.

For three days and nights, Sebastian had stayed with Isabella's body, refusing to leave.

Zaire pushed the door open, and Nina walked in.

It was very cold inside, with drafts and cold mist everywhere.

The empty room was lit by a single lamp, focusing on the stretcher bed in the center.

The stretcher bed was empty, the white shroud on the floor, stained with blood.

Nina's gaze fell on the right-hand corner.

In that dark corner sat Sebastian, head drooping, shoulders hunched, holding a charred corpse, like an immovable stone statue.

Sebastian sat there, as if the world's troubles no longer concerned him.

Zaire walked over and softly called, "Sebastian?"

Sebastian didn't move.

When Zaire reached out to take the body, Sebastian tightened his arms, growling hoarsely, "Get away!"

He held the body even tighter, as if it were the most precious treasure in the world, refusing to let go.

###chapter 197  Bracelet

Seeing his longtime friend act like this, Zaire's heart ached as if pierced by a knife.

He no longer touched the charred corpse but said to Sebastian, "Nina is here. She wants to see Isabella."

Sebastian seemed to relax slightly and began to sob quietly.

With a thud, Nina fell to her knees, looking at the charred corpse in Sebastian's arms, shaking her head. "How could this happen? How could this happen?"

"Nina." Kelsey held her, and their cries echoed throughout the room.

Nina pushed her away and crawled forward to the charred corpse.

Nina was too pained to cry. At this moment, Nina only felt as if someone had taken an axe and split her insides in half.

That kind of despair was something she had never experienced in her life.

Nina sat dazed for a while, then suddenly seemed to remember something. She got up and grabbed the charred corpse's hands to look at them.

"Nina, what are you looking for?" Zaire noticed her strange actions.

Nina said, "I'm looking for the bracelet. This isn't Bella. This absolutely isn't Bella. Bella wore a bracelet on her wrist, and this one doesn't have it!"

"Bracelet?" Zaire was puzzled. "What bracelet?"

In fact, he wanted to say, "even if she wore a bracelet, with such a big explosion and such high temperatures, the body was almost burned to ashes, let alone the bracelet."

"When Bella was a child, she had a severe illness. All the doctors said she couldn't be cured, and Bella was barely breathing. I carried her on my back, kneeling and praying all the way from the foot of the mountain to the top, and got a bracelet. The priest said that the bracelet could ward off evil. Besides, it was made of a special material that wouldn't melt in high temperatures. Bella has worn it on her wrist all these years and never took it off. This can't be Bella's body!"

The more Nina spoke, the more agitated she became. "This isn't Isabella! Sebastian, do you hear me?"

"Bracelet?" Sebastian slowly raised his head, but his eyes were lifeless and hollow. "What kind of bracelet?"

"Crystal, Bella wore it for years, and there are faint red threads on it."

Sebastian's heart was struck hard. "That bracelet is Isabella's?"

"Yes!" Nina's eyes widened. "Have you seen it?"

Sebastian didn't answer her but shouted loudly, "Jack!"

The door opened, and Jack walked in. "Mr. Landon."

"Go to the company and bring me the bracelet from the second drawer of my desk!"

"Yes!" Jack took the order and left.

Nina understood. "Bella's bracelet is with you?"

Tears streamed down Sebastian's face. "It turns out it was Isabella's. It was hers all along. I always thought it was Vanessa's!"

Jack returned quickly.

"Mr. Landon, the bracelet."

Jack handed the bracelet over, and Sebastian reached out to take it but missed Jack's hand.

Jack was stunned.

Everyone else was also taken aback.

Sebastian seemed unaware, groping around after missing. "Jack?"

Jack's hand was clearly in front of Sebastian, but Sebastian seemed unable to see it and continued to fumble around.

Zaire was shocked. He raised his hand and waved it in front of Sebastian's eyes.

Sebastian had no reaction, not even blinking.

"Jack! Where are you?" Sebastian was getting angry.

"Mr. Landon, here." Jack quickly handed it over.

Sebastian touched the bracelet, and the anger on his face faded.

He felt the bracelet and handed it to Nina. "Is this it?"

Nina took a look. "Yes, this is it! Bella wasn't wearing it? How did it end up with you?"

Sebastian's expression was serious. "Are you sure? Is this definitely Bella's?"

Nina took the bracelet from his palm, examined it carefully, and said firmly, "No mistake, Bella's name is engraved on the bead in the middle. There's no mistake!"

Sebastian froze completely.

Jack also understood. "If this bead is Isabella's, then she was the woman who crawled into Mr. Landon's tent that night during the camping trip."

"That means Vanessa was impersonating her!"

"That means." Jack's eyes flickered, looking at the belly of the charred corpse with shock.

Sebastian laughed, and as he laughed, he began to cry.

In the end, he was so hysterical that it was hard to tell if he was crying or laughing.

"Mr. Landon."

"Sebastian."

Everyone was worried about Sebastian's state.

"It was her. It really was her. How foolish I was to only realize it now!"

Kelsey and Zaire were both confused. They didn't know what Sebastian was talking about or what the bracelet meant.

Zaire asked, "What is going on?"

Sebastian didn't answer him but looked up and asked Nina, "Nina, the child in Bella's belly is mine, right?"

Nina's tears streamed down. "Yes!"

She choked up, "There were a few times she planned to tell you. At first, I was worried you weren't sincere with her, so I told her to wait. Later, Bella told me she realized you really liked the child. Even knowing the child wasn't yours, you had no prejudice. At that time, I advised her to tell you about the child. But she said she wanted to wait until the child was born to tell you. She said you would be very happy then. But..."

Thinking back to the past, who would have thought Sebastian would learn the truth at the moment of Isabella's death!

Life was too bitter, filled with more regret and sorrow than joy.

"Bella, Bella!"

Sebastian's cries were heart-wrenching, and finally, he spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted.

This time, Sebastian was unconscious for seven days.

Despite the doctors' constant attention, his vitality remained fragile.

Emily stood by the bedside, looking at the emaciated Sebastian, tears streaming down.

"Sebastian, I know you hate me, but you can't just die like this. You have to get better. Don't you hate me? Then why don't you get up and take your revenge on me?"

The doctor standing nearby shook his head and sighed. "All his vital signs are good, but he has completely lost the will to live. In other words, he doesn't want to live or wake up."

Emily fell to her knees. "Doctor, I beg you. Please save him. I beg you!"

"We will do our best, but..." The doctor glanced back at the emaciated Sebastian on the bed. Who would have thought that Sebastian was once the man who built the Landon Group from scratch?

"But what?" The door to the ward opened, and an elderly voice sounded.

Emily looked at the suddenly appearing Zoe and immediately went to support her. "Zoe, you're finally here!"

###chapter 198  Fool

"Sebastian, my grandson!" Zoe trembled as she walked in. She could hardly recognize him.

"Zoe, Sebastian always listened to you. Please, get him to wake up!" Emily sobbed.

Zoe held Sebastian's hand, her voice shaking. "Sebastian, I'm back. I'm sorry for being mad and leaving you alone. Please wake up. I can't go on if you don't."

Isabella's death hit everyone hard.

After the morgue, Nina got sick too.

Luckily, the Jose family took care of her, so it wasn't too bad.

But she couldn't eat, which broke Margaret's heart.

Margaret sat by her bed, holding a bowl. "Nina, I know you don't feel like eating, but you have to. It's been three days."

Nina stared blankly at the ceiling, too drained to cry anymore.

Seeing her like this, Margaret felt awful. She wiped her tears and said, "Bella wouldn't want to see you like this, Nina."

Everyone tried to console her-Margaret, Steven, Zaire, and Kelsey-but Nina wouldn't listen.

She had fainted from hunger several times. The doctor warned she might die or become disabled if this continued.

Kelsey remembered when Margaret was hurt, Nina also refused to eat until Isabella got Richard involved.

Since Nina returned to the Jose family, Richard hadn't shown up, even after Isabella's death shook the city.

Kelsey felt something was off, so she decided to find Richard at the Number One Casino.

But she didn't know where it was, so she called Zaire.

Steven and Zaire were both businessmen but very different. Steven played it safe and honest, avoiding anything shady. Zaire, young and ambitious, took risks and had underground connections.

The Number One Casino was famous in Lakina, and Zaire surely knew about it.

But Zaire was busy investigating the car accident, so Kelsey had to call him.

"Hey, Zaire, got a minute? I need to go to the Number One Casino."

Zaire thought it was a prank. He checked the caller ID and saw it was Kelsey. "You serious?"

"Yes, I am!" Kelsey said. "Nina's life is at risk. I need to find Richard."

Zaire knew about the last incident, so he didn't argue with Kelsey. He just said, "That's not a place you should go. I'll send someone to find Richard. You stay home."

"But Zaire, what if they can't find him?"

Kelsey knew Richard was the leader of the casino. Not just anyone could meet him.

"What if they hit a wall with his underlings? I'm still worried. I'd better go myself!"

Maybe Zaire thought she had a point, or maybe he was afraid she'd sneak off to the casino.

After a moment, he said, "Wait at home. I'll send someone to pick you up and take you to the Number One Casino."

Kelsey waited at home for half an hour. When she heard a car outside, she grabbed her bag and ran out.

"Jack?" Kelsey paused but walked over.

"Mr. Jose asked me to take you to the Number One Casino." Jack opened the car door for her.

"Thanks." Kelsey didn't say much. Saving Nina was urgent. She needed to get to the casino and see Richard.

The Number One Casino.

Kelsey didn't expect the famous casino's entrance to be a bar.

She had been to this bar before!

In broad daylight, the bar was closed, with only a few lights on and hardly anyone around.

It felt deserted.

Jack led her through the bar's lobby and hallway, pushed open a door at the end, and exited into a quiet, narrow alley.

"Are we out of the bar already?" Kelsey looked around. "Are you sure this is the way?"

"Yes." Jack responded, striding ahead.

Kelsey stared at his back, thinking Jack was really a blockhead. Not only was his mind wooden, but he was also physically wooden. Walking with her, he didn't know to be a gentleman and wait for her.

The alley had just had snow, and the ground was a bit slippery. Kelsey wasn't paying attention and twisted her ankle, falling to the ground.

She cried out in surprise.

Her hand pressed into the snow, cold as ice.

Jack walked back. "What happened?"

"Nothing." Kelsey replied irritably. She propped herself up and stood, brushing the snow off her clothes.

"Really nothing?" Jack saw she seemed fine and didn't take it to heart.

"Yes." Kelsey nodded and took a step forward.

As soon as she took a step, she felt a sharp pain in her ankle.

Kelsey looked up, wanting to call Jack and tell him she was hurt.

But when she looked up, she saw Jack had already walked several steps ahead.

His stride was as large and hurried as before.

Jack didn't show any concern or accommodation towards her.

"Idiot!" Kelsey gritted her teeth and cursed at his back, then endured the pain and followed.

Finally reaching the end, Jack raised his hand and knocked on the door three times.

After a moment, someone opened the door, and inside stood dozens of strong bodyguards.

At a glance, it was intimidating.

The leader seemed to recognize Jack and quickly said, "Mr. Brown, what brings you here today?"

Jack said, "Looking for Richard. Is he here?"

"Richard?" The leader's eyes flashed with an unclear emotion and shook his head. "Richard hasn't been in Lakina lately. What do you need him for?"

Jack was about to ask when Kelsey hurried over and asked, "Where did he go? Did he say when he'd be back?"

###chapter 199 Extremely Boring

"He didn't say," the man replied, eyeing Kelsey before bowing. "You must be the one Michael mentioned, Richard's girlfriend?"

Kelsey blushed.

Before she could respond, Jack frowned and snapped, "What nonsense! This is the young lady from the Jose family."

"Oh, sorry," the man said, scratching his head. "I just noticed how concerned she seemed about Richard and assumed..."

Jack's face darkened even more.

Kelsey ignored Jack and explained, "Mr. Cole is a friend of my sister. She's in trouble, and I need his help. Is he really not here?"

"He's really not here, but if it's urgent, I can take you to Michael. He might know when Richard will be back." The man seemed eager to help, maybe out of respect for Jack or Kelsey's mention of a friend.

Kelsey nodded. "Alright, thank you."

Jack looked like he wanted to say something, but Kelsey walked in without acknowledging him.

Jack pursed his lips and followed.

They passed through two more courtyards. When they opened the third door, a loud noise hit them.

The place was packed with gambling tables on both floors.

The casino was buzzing with shouts, sighs, and screams under a huge crystal chandelier.

It was Kelsey's first time in a casino, and she found it fascinating. She glanced at a table and saw chips piled high.

She'd seen those colorful chips in movies. The stakes here could ruin someone!

"Open!" someone shouted excitedly, revealing the cards.

Some people laughed, others groaned in frustration.

Kelsey wanted to watch more, but Jack pulled her arm. "Ms. Jose, this isn't for you!"

Kelsey looked at Jack's stern face and found it amusing. "I'm just looking."

Jack insisted, "You shouldn't be looking either!"

Kelsey raised an eyebrow. "Jack, my eyes are my own. Whether I look or not is up to me. My family doesn't control me, so why should you?"

"Ms. Jose, I promised Mr. Jose to bring you here safely. If something happens, I can't explain it to him."

Jack spoke politely but seriously, like an old-fashioned elder.

"You're really boring!" Kelsey said and walked away.

They went upstairs, through the noise, and into a private room.

The room was luxurious, with a plush carpet.

The atmosphere was different from outside.

Outside was chaotic and noisy.

Inside, it was quiet, with a long table surrounded by wealthy businessmen from Lakina.

Kelsey recognized some faces, including Parker, who was close to her father. She didn't know Parker's full name.

"Parker," Kelsey called out, but her eyes landed on the person next to him.

Next to Parker was a young woman with heavy makeup, a miniskirt, and bare shoulders. She had a red wig and glittering gold eyeshadow, half-leaning in Parker's arms with a charming smile.

Despite the thick makeup, Kelsey immediately recognized her as Nancy!

Kelsey glanced at Jack and felt a bit sorry for him. 'Poor Jack, so clueless,' she thought.

But Jack didn't even look at Nancy. Instead, he met Kelsey's eyes and then looked elsewhere. "That's Michael," he said.

Jack was so calm, it was hard to tell if he really didn't see Nancy, was pretending not to, or just didn't recognize her.

The man who brought them over had already approached Michael, bent down, and whispered, "Michael, Miss Jose is here to see Richard."

Michael raised an eyebrow, tilting his head slightly. His gaze swept over Jack's face and then slowly fell on Kelsey's.

'Is it him?' Kelsey thought, recognizing him.

Wasn't he the one she and Isabella had seen when they spied on Nina and Richard having dinner together?

At that time, Kelsey had asked his name, but Michael didn't say. Later, Isabella mentioned he was Richard's subordinate, and Kelsey assumed he was a thug.

Now, Michael was slouched at the gambling table, one hand on the back of his chair. His black leather jacket was open, revealing a black T-shirt underneath. A long silver chain with a cross pendant hung around his neck, almost reaching his abdomen.

As Michael moved, the cross reflected a cold light under the lamp.

"Do you know him?" Jack asked.

Kelsey didn't answer and walked over.

Michael had already looked away and continued playing cards.

Seeing Kelsey approach, he frowned in displeasure.

There were rules in a casino, especially during a game. Interruptions weren't allowed.

If Kelsey broke the rules, he wouldn't care about her identity; he'd deal with her according to the rules!

Michael made up his mind, but to his surprise, Kelsey just stood aside, waiting silently.

Knowing the rules in the place as well, Jack wanted to remind her, but Kelsey was already behaving well.

He gave Kelsey a curious look.

But Kelsey's attention was on the gambling table. She seemed very interested in everything about the casino!

Jack sensed danger, his fingers slowly clenching at his side.

Once this was over, he had to get Kelsey out of here immediately. If she picked up bad habits, he wouldn't be able to explain it to Zaire.

The game continued.

Across the table, Nancy stared at Jack, her eyes filled with panic.

But then she remembered she had already broken up with Jack!

He couldn't control her anymore!

Now, whoever she was with, Jack had no right to interfere!

So, Jack hadn't interfered, not even glancing in her direction since he entered.

Nancy noticed that Jack's gaze seemed to drift towards Kelsey.

Nancy felt a bit uncomfortable. Was Jack with Kelsey now?

###chapter 200  Rubbing Salt into the Wound

"Show your cards."

"Mr. Peterson wins," Michael said, revealing his hand with a smile despite losing. "You've got some luck, Mr. Peterson."

The dealer pushed all the chips to Parker.

Parker grinned. "Thanks to Michael."

Michael replied, "No need for formalities. We're all friends, and Richard gave the go-ahead."

Michael glanced at Nancy beside Parker, teasing, "Mr. Peterson, you've got good luck and a good eye."

"Not at all. Nancy, say hi to Michael."

Nancy stood up and sweetly said, "Michael."

"Nancy?" Michael said with a hint of playfulness, "Nice name"

In the room, all the men wore long sleeves and pants, except Nancy, who wore very little. Her outfit barely covered her, drawing a lot of attention.

As she stood, all eyes were on her.

Nancy seemed shy, lowering her head but sneaking glances at Jack to see his reaction.

Jack showed no reaction.

Michael smiled, stood up, and said, "I have to go."

With that, Michael left.

Kelsey and Jack followed.

As they exited, Kelsey saw Nancy's angry eyes fixed on Jack.

Kelsey looked at Jack. "Didn't you recognize her?"

"What?" Jack asked.

"That Nancy inside, isn't she your fiancÃ©e?" Kelsey bluntly said, "You used to protect her so much, but now you see her with another man and stay indifferent?"

Jack pressed his lips tightly, saying nothing.

Kelsey couldn't resist. "I thought you were deeply in love, but you're just like those men, heartless and cold."

Jack stayed silent.

He felt a lump in his chest, unable to swallow it down.

Why did Kelsey's words sting so much?

"Ms. Jose, it's unethical to kick someone when they're down."

Kelsey sneered. "Haven't you lectured me as well?"

Rolling her eyes, Kelsey quickened her pace, leaving Jack behind.

Jack was speechless.

They moved to another private room.

Michael had someone bring tea and snacks. He sat, lighting a cigarette.

"Go ahead! What do you need from Richard?"

Kelsey stepped forward. "When will Mr. Cole be back?"

Michael eyed her through the smoke. "He didn't specify. What's so urgent?"

"It's Nina," Kelsey said.

"Nina?" Michael paused.

Remembering Richard's instructions, he asked, "What's wrong with her?"

"Nina's depressed, not eating, barely alive. I want Mr. Cole to visit her." Kelsey looked anxious and worried, her eyes moistening.

Michael was silent for a moment, then said, "Depression is a mental illness. Richard isn't a doctor. Even if he goes, Nina might not listen."

"She will!" Kelsey insisted. "Last time, no one could get through to her, but Mr. Cole did."

Michael took a long drag on his cigarette and exhaled. "Nina's not young anymore, yet she still acts so dramatic. She hits a minor bump and goes on a hunger strike. What's the point? Richard cares deeply for her, but she doesn't seem to care about his feelings."

Kelsey was taken aback. "What do you mean?"

"Nothing," Michael said, waving his hand and putting out the cigarette. "Richard isn't in Lakina right now. I don't know when he'll be back, and I can't contact him during his trips. I'll let him know as soon as I can reach him or when he returns. But..."

Michael paused, then continued, "Ms. Jose, tell Nina that if she wants Richard to care for her, she should care for him too. Relationships go both ways."

Kelsey was puzzled. "What's wrong with Mr. Cole? He's so strong. Does he need others to care for him?"

Michael laughed. "Just because someone is strong doesn't mean they don't need care."

Michael looked away. "Take care! The casino is busy, so I won't see you off."

With that, Kelsey and Jack were shown out.

Kelsey was a bit skeptical. "Jack, do you think Mr. Cole is really not in Lakina?"

Jack shrugged. "Richard's identity is special. He does go out periodically. I don't think Michael would lie."

Kelsey had nothing more to say.

As they walked out, they saw Nancy, draped in fur, standing in the cold wind.

Nancy was alone; Parker was nowhere to be seen.

"Jack," Nancy called, blocking their path.

Kelsey raised an eyebrow and instinctively stepped aside to leave.

But Jack suddenly grabbed her hand.

Kelsey was stunned.

Nancy also paused, looking at him holding Kelsey's hand, her lips pressed tightly.

Nancy looked at Jack expectantly. "Jack, I have something important to tell you."

Jack looked at Nancy, conflicted.

After a moment, he let go of Kelsey's hand. "Ms. Jose, please wait for me outside."

Kelsey stared into his eyes, then smirked and walked away.

That smile felt like a brand, searing into Jack's heart.

Jack felt a bit uncomfortable.

"Jack, are you still mad at me?" Nancy reached out to grab his hand.

But as soon as her fingers touched him, Jack pulled away.

"What's the matter?" Jack asked directly.

Nancy looked hurt. "Jack, why didn't you return my calls or messages? Do you hate me that much?"

Jack's voice was calm. "Didn't you say it yourself? From now on, we have no relationship. If that's the case, there's no need to stay in touch."

Nancy shook her head. "That's not what I meant."

"Then what do you mean?"

"Jack, please don't be mad at me, okay? We've grown up together, and I've always seen you as a brother. It was my parents who insisted you take care of me for life to repay their kindness. It's my fault; I should have made it clear to you earlier."

###chapter 201 Is This How You Ask for Help?

"It's not too late to clear things up," Jack said calmly, eyeing the hickey on her neck. "Nancy, Lakina's wealth can be blinding. You deserve a happy life, and I won't stop you. But don't get lost in luxury; you might never find your way out."

"Jack." Nancy grabbed his hand as he turned to leave. "Can you accept me as a sister?"

Jack paused, then pulled his hand away. "I've already sent money to your parents. We're even now."

With that, Jack walked off.

Nancy bit her lip, a hint of frustration in her eyes.

Just then, someone approached. "Ms. Shaw, please come with me."

Nancy nodded, wiped her tears, and forced a smile.

She followed the person, climbing upward.

Through layers of noise, Nancy opened the door to the lounge.

Michael stood by the window, tall and striking in black.

"Michael, I've brought her," the subordinate said before leaving and closing the door.

Michael turned, his gaze landing on Nancy.

In her high heels, Nancy walked over. "Michael."

Michael smiled. "Mr. Peterson sent you to me?"

Nancy bit her lip. "I have nothing to do with Mr. Peterson. I begged him to bring me here. I wanted to see you, Michael."

Michael raised an eyebrow, eyes dangerous. "What do you want, Ms. Shaw?"

Nancy felt uneasy under his gaze. She knew Michael wasn't an ordinary man.

But the more dangerous he was, the more she wanted to get close.

To stand at the top, she had to throw away her dignity. Otherwise, she'd end up like Jack, working for others forever.

Nancy approached, placing her left hand on Michael's shoulder, eyes seductive. "From now on, I belong to you, Michael."

Michael raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean? I don't understand."

Nancy bit her lip, took off her fur coat, and guided Michael's hand inside her clothes.

Michael's hand touched her skin but then gripped her waist tightly.

Nancy looked up, eyes misty with tears. "Michael, it hurts."

Michael smiled faintly, fingers digging harder. "It's not your first time. What's there to hurt?"

Nancy was stunned.

The next second, Michael pushed her away.

Nancy stumbled back, staring at him. "Michael?"

"Don't call me!" Michael frowned. "It's disgusting."

Nancy was speechless.

Michael was blunt, not giving her any face, making her feel awkward.

He walked to the desk, opened a drawer, took out a stack of cash, and threw it on the table. "Take this and get out!"

Nancy glanced at it. Twenty thousand dollars.

She didn't understand.

If Michael wasn't interested, why give her twenty thousand dollars?

Even if the casino had a lot of money, it wasn't to be wasted like this.

Twenty thousand dollars seemed like a lot, but compared to what she wanted, it was just a drop in the bucket.

Nancy stood still. "Michael?"

Michael's cold gaze swept over her. "Call me that again, and I'll cut out your tongue!"

Nancy didn't dare call him again. She knew he meant it.

Michael looked at her impatiently. "Take the money and change your name!"

Nancy asked, "Why?"

"Because you're not worthy of that name!" Michael snapped. "Don't call yourself Nancy anymore. If I hear it, you know the consequences!"

Nancy was speechless.

When Jack came out, he found his car gone. Kelsey had driven it back without waiting for him! He sighed and hailed a cab.

Kelsey had just returned home and saw several doctors in the house.

Margaret cried, "Kelsey, Nina has fainted."

"What?" Kelsey's face turned pale. She ran upstairs to see Nina.

Nina had passed out. The doctors tested her and found her body's indicators were not up to standard. Even with a feeding tube, Nina had no will to live.

"She wants to die!" Margaret sobbed.

"Have you informed Dad and Zaire?" Kelsey asked.

Margaret shook her head. "We've done our best. It's a problem of her will!"

Kelsey gritted her teeth. "Mom, take care of Nina. I'll be back soon!"

She left the house and drove back to Casino One.

The people at the door were surprised to see Kelsey return.

Kelsey barged in. Michael wasn't in the office, but Nancy was there, holding twenty thousand dollars, sitting in a daze.

Kelsey's gaze swept over her and the fur coat on the floor, feeling a wave of disgust.

"Where's Michael?" Kelsey asked.

Nancy didn't speak. She picked up the fur coat and the money, walking out.

Kelsey grabbed her. "I asked you! Where's Michael?"

Nancy sneered. "What? Ms. Jose, someone so pure and clean, also needs to see Michael?"

Kelsey ignored her and started searching the office. She looked around but didn't find anyone.

Nancy suddenly looked towards the door.

"Why haven't you left?" Michael walked in, his cold eyes sweeping over her.

Nancy said, "I'm leaving now."

Then she slowly walked out, waiting for Kelsey to be kicked out too.

"Ms. Jose, why are you back?" Michael's voice rang out.

Kelsey saw him and rushed over, grabbing his hands. "Nina is dying! Michael, I'm begging you! Help me contact Mr. Cole!"

Michael was taken aback. He gazed down at Kelsey's hands clasping his own, a wave of emotion disturbing his typically composed heart.

He turned his hand to hold Kelsey's, pulling her into his arms. "Ms. Jose, what do you have to offer?"

Kelsey paused, feeling Michael's hand on her waist. In anger, she pushed him away and slapped him across the face.

The slap was crisp and loud.

Nancy, who had reached the door, turned back at the sound, shocked by the scene. She felt a bit of schadenfreude.

Kelsey dared to hit Michael! She was done for!

Michael used his tongue to push against his cheek, his eyes sweeping over Kelsey, half-smiling. "Is this how you ask for help, Ms. Jose?"

###chapter 202  Locked in the Dungeon

Kelsey was stunned for a moment. She came for help, so how did it turn into a fight? But thinking it over, it was Michael's fault!

"Who told you to touch me?" Kelsey snapped.

Michael sneered. "What, I can't even touch you? Are you that special?"

"You!" Kelsey was seething. She felt humiliated-she had always been pampered and protected by her family. With Zaire and Steven around, no one had ever dared to treat her with such disrespect.

Kelsey wasn't weak. Even facing Michael, she wasn't scared. She didn't regret slapping him earlier; she felt she should've slapped him more.

Michael deserved it for his foul mouth!

As soon as Michael finished speaking, Kelsey raised her hand again. But this time, Michael grabbed her wrist. The slap didn't land.

"What, you want more?" Michael laughed angrily. No one besides Richard had ever dared to hit him like this!

"I'll teach you to watch your mouth!" Kelsey not only hit him but also cursed him! How could Michael tolerate that?

Michael tightly gripped Kelsey's hand. Her hand was soft and slender, feeling very delicate. Looking at Kelsey's defiant face, Michael felt a sense of conquest growing inside him. He wanted to see Kelsey cry, to hear her beg him. That would be a different kind of pleasure.

"Fine, very fine," Michael sneered, throwing Kelsey to the ground. "Guards!"

Two burly men immediately walked in. "Michael."

Michael pointed at Kelsey on the ground. "Lock Ms. Jose in the dungeon!"

Nancy's eyes flashed with satisfaction as she quickened her pace and left.

Kelsey stared in disbelief. "Michael, you dare!"

Michael smiled. "You'll find out soon enough."

Kelsey was lifted by the two burly men and dragged out. Even though she struggled with all her might, it was no use.

"Michael, if you dare mistreat me, Zaire will kill you!" Kelsey threatened.

By this time, Kelsey had already been dragged to the door.

"Wait!" Michael's voice suddenly rang out. The burly men stopped.

Michael walked over, stopping in front of Kelsey. "Ms. Jose, if you're scared, just beg for mercy. I'll let you go for the sake of Mr. Jose and Mr. Landon."

Kelsey gritted her teeth. "You pervert!"

Michael was speechless. He waved his hand. "Take her away. And call Mr. Jose, tell him I'm hosting Ms. Jose for a few days."

Kelsey was speechless.

Zaire had gone to the hospital, and Sebastian was still in a coma. Zoe and Emily were by Sebastian's bedside.

When Zaire received Michael's call, he was stunned for a moment. "What do you mean?"

Michael on the other end said, "Ms. Jose was out of line. Since Mr. Jose can't discipline her, I'll do it for you."

"Michael, if anything happens to Kelsey, I will flatten Casino One if I have to," Zaire said.

Michael laughed. "Ms. Jose came to ask for my help, slapped me twice, and now she's in my hands. Shouldn't you be speaking more politely? Or is this how the Jose family usually asks for help?"

Zaire knew Michael's character. Michael wouldn't trouble Kelsey for no reason. Zaire knew Kelsey's temper very well; it was probably a moment of impulse.

Zaire knew Michael wouldn't really harm Kelsey.

Lately, things had been chaotic. Zaire was juggling the Jose Group, helping with the Landon Group, dealing with Charles, and investigating the car accident. He was already overwhelmed. Handling Michael and Richard now would be too much.

"Hasn't Richard come back yet?" Zaire knew about the tension between Richard and Nina, which meant Michael wouldn't dare harm Kelsey.

"Not yet," Michael replied. "I've delivered my message. I'll send Ms. Jose back in five days."

With that, Michael hung up. Zaire looked at his phone and shook his head helplessly.

Isabella had been bedridden for three days. The first two days, she couldn't move at all. Samantha brought her meals, turned her over, and pressed her abdomen. Occasionally, she opened the curtains for fresh air. Isabella hadn't seen anyone else. Even the IV fluids were changed by Samantha.

By the third day, Isabella could sit up but trying to walk felt like stepping on knives. Determined to recover, she gritted her teeth and walked slowly by the bed.

As night fell, Samantha brought her meal again, moving like a robot without any extra actions or expressions. Isabella watched her set the table. When Samantha turned to leave, Isabella grabbed her, stood up, and pressed a pulled-out needle against Samantha's neck.

Samantha was startled, fear finally showing on her usually numb face. Isabella saw this and said, "Samantha, you can hear me, right?"

Samantha didn't respond. Isabella pricked her neck with the needle. Samantha flinched in pain.

"I know you can't speak right now," Isabella said. "I'll ask, and if I'm right, you nod. If I'm wrong, you shake your head. Otherwise, I'll stick this needle into your artery!"

Samantha nodded cooperatively.

"Are we still in Lakina?" Isabella asked. Samantha nodded.

"What about my child? Are they safe?" Isabella asked. Samantha nodded again. Isabella was overjoyed. Her child was her biggest concern. As long as the child was safe, she could relax.

"Who is keeping me here?" Isabella continued. Samantha looked at the wall. Following her gaze, Isabella saw a photo of Matthew.

"Is it Emma and Charles?" Isabella asked. Samantha nodded.

"They plan to keep me here to threaten Sebastian?" Isabella asked.

Just as Samantha was about to respond, footsteps sounded from the doorway. The doorknob turned, and someone pushed the door open.

###chapter 203  You Are Already Dead

Isabella was shocked to see a third person there. She stared wide-eyed at the door.

"Leo?"

Leo glanced at the restrained Samantha and said calmly, "Isabella, put the needle down."

Isabella tightened her grip on Samantha and threatened, "Leo, I always knew you were trouble. Let me out, or I'll stab Samantha!"

Leo sneered. "If you think stabbing Samantha will help, go ahead."

He made it sound like Samantha was just a stray cat, not a person.

Samantha bit her lip, looking at Leo.

Isabella was stunned by his coldness. "Leo, if Samantha dies, how will you explain it?"

Leo glanced out the window. "The sharks outside are hungry."

Samantha shivered, her legs going weak.

Isabella was taken aback by Leo's heartlessness. She hadn't expected him to be so cold.

Just earlier, Leo had seemed very caring towards Samantha.

Leo looked at Isabella and frowned. "Isabella, put the needle down. Your hand is bleeding!"

Isabella looked down and saw blood gushing from her hand.

The bleeding wasn't fast, but it had already stained Samantha's clothes red.

While Isabella was in a daze, Leo walked over, controlled her hand, and released Samantha.

Leo removed the needle from Isabella's hand, threw it in the trash, and pressed a cotton swab on the wound.

The bleeding slowly stopped.

Leo turned to Samantha. "Go get the doctor."

Samantha nodded and left.

"Leo!" Isabella glared at him. "Why are you working with Emma and Charles to hurt us?"

Leo glanced at her, then looked away. "I have no choice."

"Why?"

"Isabella, I won't explain. Even if I did, you wouldn't understand. Just know I don't intend to hurt you. I'm just getting a little benefit from this."

Leo spoke lightly, but Isabella imagined the worst.

"If I go missing, Sebastian will look for me! You can't hide me here forever."

"We can try," Leo replied firmly. "Besides, Isabella, you're not missing. To the world, you're already dead."

Isabella was shocked. "What?"

Leo showed her a news article on his phone.

[The Landon Group's Future Wife Ms. Miller Dies in Car Accident on Bay Avenue: Was Eight Months Pregnant.]

The article was detailed and convincing.

Isabella wanted to see more, but Leo took the phone away.

Isabella reached for it. "Give it to me!"

Leo smashed the phone against the windowsill, then controlled Isabella's hands and pressed her onto the hospital bed.

His actions pulled at Isabella's wound, causing her forehead to sweat, and she almost couldn't catch her breath.

Leo loosened his grip a bit. "Isabella, you're already 'dead.' Emma promised that if you stay put, they won't hurt you again."

Isabella shook her head. "Leo, this is illegal detention!"

"Isabella, be good," Leo said, caressing her cheek. "When this is over, I'll send you abroad and take care of you and your child."

"You're dreaming!" Isabella snapped. "I'd rather die than be manipulated by you."

Leo's expression darkened, but he still stared at her face. "Still thinking about Sebastian? Remember what you saw before the accident? Sebastian and Emily together! Now that you're 'dead,' Sebastian is heartbroken, but how long will that last?"

Isabella was stunned, tears falling silently.

"Emily is almost always with Sebastian now. It won't be long before you hear about their wedding," Leo continued.

"Impossible!" Isabella shook her head. She still believed in Sebastian.

Leo sighed. "Isabella, I'll protect you no matter what."

He reached out, gently touching the corner of her lips.

Isabella, pale and trembling from her recent surgery, looked like a withered flower.

Leo felt a pang of pity and leaned down to kiss her.

"Isabella," he whispered.

Isabella bit his lip.

Leo straightened up in pain, covering his lip, but laughed. "You've finally learned to bite."

Just then, Samantha brought the doctor in.

The doctor reinserted the needle into Isabella's hand.

"Samantha will take care of you," Leo said. "A C-section is draining, so get your IV. And don't think about escaping; there's no way out."

Isabella looked out the window, silent.

Leo stared at her until his phone rang, then turned to leave.

Samantha followed him out, handing him his coat.

"Thank you," Leo said, taking it. He turned to leave but was stopped by Samantha.

She looked at him expectantly.

Leo and Samantha locked eyes for a few seconds. "Take good care of her. If anything happens to her, you won't survive either."

The light in Samantha's eyes dimmed, and she let go of his hand.

Leo's gaze held no affection for her now.

Samantha had seen everything that happened earlier. She wanted to win Leo back.

After everything, she realized she had real feelings for him.

When she was with Leo, she had been genuinely happy, without any scheming.

She thought, she loved Leo.

Otherwise, she wouldn't have had an affair with him while dating Matthew.

'The heart can lie, but the body cannot,' Samantha thought.

But now it seemed Leo had fallen for Isabella.

###chapter 204  Bitten by a Rat

Jack went to the Jose residence to pick up his car.

He'd waited two days, hoping Kelsey would return it.

But after two days, still no car.

'With Kelsey's temper, she won't budge,' Jack thought.

So, he decided to get it himself.

When he got there, his car wasn't in the yard.

A servant told him Kelsey had taken it again and hadn't been back for two days.

Jack's heart sank. "She hasn't been back for two days, and Mr. Jose isn't worried?"

The servant replied, "Mr. Jose said Ms. Jose is at Casino One and will be back in a few days."

"Casino One, again?"

Seeing Jack's worry, the servant tried to reassure him, "Mr. Brown, don't worry. Mr. Jose said Ms. Jose is fine, just playing for a few days."

Jack's face grew more serious.

He remembered how into gambling Kelsey was and felt uneasy.

He left the Jose family and found himself outside Casino One.

How did he end up here?

He was worried about Kelsey, but if Zaire wasn't, why should he be?

With Zaire's connections, no one at the casino would mess with Kelsey.

He had no reason to worry.

Jack started the car, ready to leave.

Just then, someone knocked on his window.

He rolled it down and saw Nancy.

She'd probably just left the casino, wrapped in a man's coat. "Jack, is that you?"

"Yeah," Jack replied.

"Are you here to find Ms. Jose?"

Jack was stunned. "Have you seen her?"

Nancy nodded, "Yes. She came back shortly after you left. I saw her..."

"What happened to her?" Jack asked, his tone anxious.

Nancy's eyes flickered, and she changed the story, "I saw her go into Michael's office. They were hugging and kissing."

Before she finished, Jack was out of the car, slamming the door.

He approached Nancy, staring into her eyes. "Nancy, lying is easy, but clearing a name is hard. You better be telling the truth!"

A hint of guilt flashed in Nancy's eyes, but she insisted, "I'm telling the truth. If you don't believe me, ask around. And Jack, even if Michael and Ms. Jose are dating, why are you so upset?"

Jack was speechless.

His reaction was over the top.

Especially when he heard about Michael and Kelsey hugging and kissing, he wanted to rush over and break them apart.

"Jack, do you like Ms. Jose?" Nancy probed.

"No!" Jack replied firmly.

Nancy said, "Right. Ms. Jose chased you shamelessly before, and you didn't want her. If you change your mind now, she might think you're not worth it."

Jack's cold gaze fixed on Nancy.

Nancy smiled, "Jack, don't take it personally. I'm just looking out for you. People like Ms. Jose are in a different league."

A sports car pulled up, and Nancy swayed her hips as she got in.

The car sped off.

Jack stood there for a while, then glanced at the casino before leaving.

Nancy was right.

He had no place beside Kelsey.

He was just a nobody.

Climbing up? He'd never even considered it.

Inside the casino.

Michael had just sat down at the table when his subordinate rushed over. "Michael."

Michael glared. "Can't you see I just started? Mess up my hand, and I'll kill you!"

Michael's temper was infamous at Casino One.

Richard might be the leader, but Michael did the dirty work.

Breaking limbs, killing people-that was Michael's job.

Like when Charlie owed a huge debt, and Isabella came to pay it off, Michael had beatn Charlie half to death with spiked gloves.

No one dared to cross Michael.

A single look from him silenced his subordinate.

After Michael finished his hand, dominating the table, more than twenty minutes had passed.

In a good mood, Michael turned and kicked his subordinate. "What's got you so red-faced?"

The subordinate quickly said, "It's Ms. Jose. She was bitten by a rat in the dungeon and passed out."

Michael's eyes narrowed. "Who let the rats in?"

The subordinate lowered his head, not daring to speak.

Kelsey had a sharp tongue.

Even locked in the dungeon, she cursed Michael and his ancestors.

Michael couldn't hear it, but the guards could.

Some, unaware of Kelsey's identity, decided to teach her a lesson.

So, they had let a few rats in.

Kelsey, terrified, screamed and jumped around.

"They just wanted to scare her, but she got bitten."

Michael suddenly stood up and kicked a chair. "Did I tell you to touch her?"

The subordinate fell silent.

When Michael arrived at the dungeon, several men were surrounding Kelsey, touching her.

"This woman is quite pretty."

"She looks innocent, but her body is something else."

"Let me have a feel."

Just as one man reached out, Michael kicked him in the back.

The kick sent him flying into the wall, and he fell to the ground, spitting blood.

Everyone froze, quickly backing away.

As they moved aside, Michael saw Kelsey lying on the ground.

She was unconscious, her collar slightly open, revealing some of her chest.

Her body and face were dirty, and she looked lifeless.

###chapter 205  Blockhead

Michael saw red. He whipped out the dagger from his sleeve and stabbed the guy who'd been messing with Kelsey.

A scream pierced the dungeon.

Michael yanked the knife out, blood spraying everywhere.

He glared at the men in the corner. "Chop them up and feed them to the dogs!"

"Michael."

They all dropped to their knees, begging for mercy.

Michael ignored them. He sheathed his dagger, walked over to Kelsey, and picked her up.

She was so thin and light, it was easy.

Her head rested against his chest, her usual arrogance gone, replaced by a softness that tugged at his heart.

Michael carried her out of the dungeon.

The doctor came and gave Kelsey an antidote.

Michael watched her fever rise, pacing anxiously. "Didn't you give her the shot? Why isn't her fever going down?"

The doctor trembled. "The antidote takes time. Please be patient."

"How can I not be anxious? Do you know who she is? If she dies here, Zaire will flip the number one casino upside down!"

A subordinate said, "Even if something happens, the Jose family wouldn't dare act rashly."

Michael was silent.

'What is the Jose family?' he thought. 'Zaire's got guts, but he's not fool enough to jeopardize the entire family's legacy. If Kelsey dies here, we'd just end up as sworn enemies. But behind the city's number one casino stands Bruno Black, a power the JosÃ© family can't hope to challenge.'

But why was he still so anxious?

His heart felt like it was on fire, his mind filled with Kelsey's face, tormenting him. Only by staying with her could he feel a bit more at ease.

In the latter half of the night, Kelsey's fever began to drop.

But the real discomfort started after the fever broke.

Sweat poured from her body, soaking her clothes quickly.

Michael had her clothes changed twice, but each time, within half an hour, they were soaked again.

Worried about her discomfort, he had her clothes changed again.

This went on until dawn before her condition slightly improved.

The doctor advised giving her plenty of water, so Michael strictly followed the schedule, giving her water at regular intervals.

He sat by the bed, holding her up, letting her lean against him, and brought the cup to her lips.

After drinking, her eyelashes fluttered.

Michael watched her nervously. "Kelsey?"

Maybe hearing his call, she slowly opened her eyes.

Seeing her confused gaze, Michael's usually cold heart seemed to soften.

"Awake?" he asked.

Kelsey felt dizzy. She saw Michael's face, but when she closed her eyes, she saw Jack's.

'Maybe when people are sick, their mind gets fuzzy,' she thought.

So it was easy for her to mix up the two.

Lost in her delirium, she mistook Michael's strong presence for Jack's familiar comfort. In her daze, she murmured, "You blockhead, have you finally come around?" Her voice was barely audible, a soft whisper, yet it held a mix of teasing and longing.

Michael didn't like that nickname; it sounded dumb.

If anyone else had called him that, he'd be furious.

But seeing Kelsey's tired face, he let it slide. She was sick, after all.

As Kelsey's breathing deepened, Michael gently placed her head on the pillow.

Just as he was about to pull his hand away, Kelsey grabbed his arm.

Michael froze. Her eyes were closed, still in a daze, but she held on tight, murmuring, "Don't go."

His heart softened, and he sat down. "Okay, I won't go."

She didn't say anything more.

Michael sat on the floor, letting her hold his arm. He quietly watched her sleep, eventually smiling. "You look so cute when you're asleep."

Kelsey didn't know how long she'd slept.

When she opened her eyes, she saw Michael's face.

Their noses were almost touching, and their lips were just a breath away.

She blinked, her long lashes brushing against his brows.

Michael moved slightly.

At that moment, footsteps sounded outside the door, along with voices.

"Mr. Brown, Michael is resting. You can't go in, Mr. Brown."

The door was kicked open. Jack walked in and saw them.

Michael was sitting on the floor, leaning on the bed, while Kelsey was sleeping on her side. From his angle, it looked like they were kissing.

Jack froze.

He looked away and said coldly, "Ms. Jose!"

Like a spell breaking, Kelsey jolted awake.

She sat up and raised her hand to slap Michael.

He stopped her in time.

"Kelsey, who taught you this bad habit of hitting people?"

She struggled. "Let go!"

Michael stood up, dusting off his clothes, and said shamelessly, "No. What can you do about it?"

She really couldn't do anything to him.

Michael was ruthless and cruel. Not only had he locked her in the dungeon, but he had also let rats bite her!

She had almost died there!

"Let go!" Kelsey gritted her teeth.

Michael looked at her flushed face and smiled.

Anyone else would have learned their lesson by now. They'd fear him for years. But Kelsey was different.

She grew braver with each setback, not only unafraid of him but even daring to fight him.

It seemed the casino's dungeon hadn't tamed her!

Michael refused to let go, a mischievous smile on his lips.

Jack couldn't stand it anymore and stepped forward. "Michael, let go of her!"

Michael raised an eyebrow.

"Blockhead!" Kelsey shouted.

Michael was stunned, realizing she wasn't calling him but Jack earlier!

Remembering how she had called out "Blockhead, don't go" so many times in her fevered state last night, Michael felt like his heart was a mess.

He let go, and Kelsey got up and ran to Jack.

She didn't even have time to put on her shoes.

Her bare feet on the cold floor looked pitiful.

Michael bent down, picked up her shoes, and handed them over.

"Thank you." Jack took them and knelt to help Kelsey put them on.

###chapter 206  Fed to the Dogs

Kelsey was caught off guard.

Jack patted her foot and said, "Lift it."

She did, and Jack gently slipped the shoe onto her cold ankle.

His touch was soft. Kelsey looked down at him, feeling like he was a loyal servant at her feet. It was a strange sensation, like taming a wild beast.

Kelsey stared at Jack, while Michael stood nearby, glaring. She ignored Michael, making him more uncomfortable.

"All done," Jack said, standing up.

Kelsey staggered back, and Jack instinctively supported her waist. Their eyes met, emotions flaring.

Michael's anger boiled over. "Someone, show them out!" he barked, storming off.

At the door, Kelsey called out, "Michael!"

He frowned, wanting to keep walking but stopping anyway.

"Has Mr. Cole returned?" she asked, still worried after being locked up for two days.

Michael replied coldly, "Richard has already seen Nina. Don't worry."

"That's good," Kelsey sighed in relief. If Richard had visited, Nina would be saved.

Michael paused. "The No. 1 Casino is chaotic. Don't come here again."

Kelsey stiffened. When she looked up, Michael was gone.

Jack took Kelsey out of the casino. She felt lightheaded, having just recovered and not eaten.

She walked slower and slower, almost out of breath.

Jack, ahead by a dozen steps, stopped and turned back. He picked her up.

Kelsey, unprepared, stared at him blankly.

Jack shifted uncomfortably, his gaze finding anywhere else to settle but on Kelsey. "Ms. Jose, please don't misunderstand me. I know you've just recovered and might have trouble walking. If it's alright with you, I can carry you out," he offered, trying to mask his nervousness.

Kelsey looked up at him, her eyes narrowing slightly. "And what if I do mind?"

Jack paused, then put her down. Once she was steady, he stepped back. "If you mind, then I won't carry you."

Kelsey was speechless.

"Jack, do you know you're like a block of wood?"

Jack looked at her seriously. "I know. Ms. Jose, I was born this way. If you don't like it, I can stay away from you."

Kelsey, both amused and annoyed, asked, "What if I like it? Would you come closer to me?"

Jack's eyes swirled with emotion.

Kelsey waited, thinking she had been clear. If Jack had feelings for her, he'd know what to do next.

Jack pressed his lips together, conflicted. After a while, he said, "I wouldn't."

Kelsey trembled with anger, feeling her passion was wasted.

Kelsey gritted her teeth and walked back to the car.

Noticing her thin clothing, Jack turned on the heater. "Is the temperature okay?" he asked.

Kelsey leaned back in the rear seat, eyes closed, too lazy to respond. She had hoped Jack would come to his senses and confess.

Jack sensed her displeasure. As he drove, he occasionally glanced at her through the rearview mirror. The drive was silent.

They arrived at the Jose family estate. As soon as the car stopped, Kelsey opened the back door and stormed into the house, slamming the door behind her.

Richard had returned late the previous night. The moment he turned on his phone, he received a text from Michael about Nina's situation. Immediately after landing, he scaled the wall and climbed through the window into Nina's room.

It was late, and Margaret was with two doctors by Nina's side. Hearing a noise on the balcony, they turned to see Richard walk in. If Margaret hadn't met him before, she might have screamed.

"How is she?" Richard asked, ignoring their stares and going straight to Nina's bedside, his eyes full of concern.

Margaret's expression softened. "Not good. She refuses to eat or drink and is now unconscious, with no will to live."

Richard said, "Margaret, could you all leave for a moment? I'll stay with her alone."

Margaret hesitated. Nina was now the Jose family's young lady. Although divorced, she was currently single. For a man like Richard to scale walls and request to be alone with her at night was questionable. If word got out, it would be frowned upon.

Seeing her concern, Richard said, "Margaret, compared to her life, do you think anything else is more important?"

Margaret was speechless. Indeed, nothing was more important than Nina being alive and well. She had spent years in guilt and self-reproach for losing Nina. Finally, she had found her, but Nina hated her deeply. She had nearly lost her life to earn Nina's forgiveness. Losing Nina again would be unbearable.

"Right now, nothing is more important than her coming back to life," Margaret said, placing all her hopes on Richard. "Mr. Cole, if you can wake Nina, the Jose family will do everything to repay you."

Richard smiled confidently. "Mrs. Jose, do you mean what you say?"

Margaret nodded solemnly. "If I say it, I will do it."

"Good," Richard nodded. "As long as Nina wakes up and regains the will to live, I will ask Mrs. Jose for something."

"What is it?" Margaret asked.

"I'll tell you when Nina wakes up."

Margaret nodded. "Alright! As long as Nina wakes up, everything is negotiable."

###chapter 207  Are You Moved?

Margaret left the bedroom with the others.

"Mrs. Jose, are you really going to hand Ms. Jose over to Mr. Cole?"

Margaret glanced at the closed bedroom door. "Isabella and Kelsey trust him, so why shouldn't I? If Nina gets better, I don't care if he's the devil himself."

Richard sat by the bed, his eyes on Nina's face.

The night was deep and quiet.

Richard took off his coat, locked the doors, and drew the curtains. He lay down beside Nina.

He gently held her. "Nina, you can't die without my permission. Do you hear me?"

"I want you to wake up. If you die, I'll make sure the whole Jose family joins you. I mean it!" Richard spoke slowly, feeling a sense of peace.

This moment of warmth was what he had longed for.

The days of running around had left him exhausted.

He held Nina, closed his eyes, and fell asleep.

Nina found herself trapped in a dream, an endless expanse of ice and snow stretching out in every direction. It was a barren wasteland, the stark whiteness blinding and unrelenting. She wandered aimlessly, her footsteps crunching in the frozen silence, each step a reminder of how isolated she felt.

Just when the cold seemed unbearable, a sudden warmth enveloped her. It started as a gentle glow, spreading through her like a comforting embrace. The harsh winter landscape began to melt away, replaced by a lush, vibrant spring. Flowers blossomed beneath her feet, and the sweet scent of blooming life filled the air. Trees, once barren, now bore blossoms, creating a canopy of hope above her.

Nina opened her eyes to see Richard's face.

He looked gentle and composed, not his usual fierce self. His high brow bone gave his eyes a deep-set look. Now, as he slept, the harshness was gone.

"Richard?" she said hoarsely.

Her voice was soft.

But Richard's eyes suddenly opened, focusing on her.

"Awake?" He brushed her hair aside. "Looks like threats work."

Nina was speechless.

She hadn't heard any threats; she just woke up naturally.

"What do you want to eat? I'll make it," Richard said.

Nina shook her head, grabbing his collar. "They said Bella is dead. I don't believe it."

"If you don't believe it, I'll investigate," Richard said, holding her hand. "But first, you need to eat."

Nina shook her head. "I can't eat."

She was worried about Isabella.

Now, she was so hungry she felt numb.

"If you die, I'll make the whole Jose family join you. Nina, you know I mean it!" Richard said, lifting her chin and staring at her.

Nina was still lying in his arms, with his arm under her head. She had to tilt her head up, while Richard leaned in close.

Charlie had never made her feel this way.

For a moment, Nina panicked.

She wanted to look away, but Richard wouldn't let her.

He pinched her chin and kissed her.

Nina's eyes widened in disbelief.

The kiss was brief; he stayed on her lips for a few seconds before pulling away.

Richard got out of bed, putting on his coat. "I'll make some food. Wait here for me."

Before Nina could say anything, Richard had already slipped out the door.

Nina was left speechless.

She bit her lip, tasting Richard's lingering flavor.

Sitting there in a daze, her heart was in turmoil.

Maybe because Richard had promised to help, Nina suddenly felt hopeful.

She didn't believe Isabella was dead!

Since Richard promised to help, she'd live well until Isabella's death was confirmed.

If Isabella wasn't really dead and came back to find Nina gone, she'd be heartbroken.

Nina had promised to take care of Isabella for life; she couldn't leave her first.

If Isabella was confirmed dead, she'd handle her affairs before joining her.

For now, Isabella's fake corpse was still in the hospital morgue, and there were many things Nina needed to do.

Nina sat on the bed for a while, then got up to get dressed.

Just as she was about to wash up, Kelsey knocked and came in.

Kelsey poked her head in. "Nina, you're up?"

She quickly entered and helped Nina.

Nina said, "I'm fine."

Kelsey looked at her with a subtle expression. "Seems like Mr. Cole is the key. As soon as he came back, you got better."

Nina frowned. "That's not true. He's not a doctor; what can he do?"

"Mr. Cole may not be a doctor, but he's more effective than one. The doctors couldn't cure you, but as soon as he came back, you woke up."

Nina was speechless.

She remembered the dream she had last night.

It was strange. She had felt trapped in the dream for so long, unable to find an exit.

Could it really be a coincidence that she recovered as soon as Richard arrived?

When did he become so important?

Nina couldn't figure it out, so she shook her head and stopped thinking about it.

Kelsey handed her a phone. "Nina, check this out."

It was a video.

The setting was the Jose residence kitchen, and a tall figure was standing by the stove, clearly making breakfast.

"Mr. Cole is making breakfast himself," Kelsey said, watching Nina's expression, "Are you touched?"

Nina pushed the phone away. "I'm not touched."

"Really?" Kelsey didn't believe it. "If a man made breakfast for me, I'd be so touched. I'd go anywhere with him."

Nina poked Kelsey's forehead. "Get rid of that romantic mindset, or you'll get kidnapped someday!"

Kelsey laughed. "I'm just kidding."

As they were talking, Richard came up with breakfast.

Kelsey wisely slipped away, leaving them alone.

"Eat." Richard placed the plate on the table.

Nina tidied up and walked over.

She looked at the breakfast, a bit dumbfounded.

"This is your breakfast?"

It was a bowl of soup.

It looked fine, a light and clear soup.

For Nina, who hadn't eaten in days, it did seem appetizing.

"Yes." Richard picked up the bowl, blew on the spoon to cool it a bit, and brought it to her lips. "Open your mouth."

Nina felt embarrassed. "I can do it myself."

Richard didn't speak, just gave her a warning look.

Nina, thinking she still needed Richard's help, compromised.

She put her hand down and accepted his feeding.

"Is it bland?" Richard's eyes showed a hint of nervousness.

Nina said, "Not bland."

"Too salty?"

"Just right." Nina, finding his spoon-feeding too slow, picked up the bowl and gulped it down.

Richard was speechless.

###chapter 208  Stealing the Body

Nina put down the bowl and got straight to it, "When are you going to help me find Isabella?"

Richard raised an eyebrow. "What's the hurry?"

Nina looked nervous. "You promised to help me, so you can't back out now."

Richard smirked, "And if I do, what can you do about it?"

Nina knew she couldn't do much.

But this was urgent. The Jose family had been searching for ages with no luck. She hoped Richard's connections could uncover what they couldn't.

Desperate, she grabbed Richard's hand. "You have to help me!"

Her sudden move made Richard pause.

He glanced at her hand on his, a playful look in his eyes. "Why should I help you?"

The look in Richard's eyes was clear. Nina knew what he wanted.

After a moment, she leaned in and kissed him lightly before pulling away.

Richard stared at her but said nothing.

Nina said, "That's a down payment. If you help me find the truth, I'll give you whatever you want!"

Richard smirked. "Alright, you said it yourself!"

"Yes."

Zaire had been investigating the car accident.

But everything seemed perfect.

The two charred bodies from that night were the Landon family's driver and a pregnant woman.

Everything matched.

Even if Richard's people investigated, they'd find the same.

The police had already closed the case.

Several rains had washed over the scene, leaving only some porcelain fragments in the grass.

Still, Richard took his people there personally.

As soon as Richard left, the hospital called, saying Sebastian was going to cremate the body.

When Nina and Zaire arrived, the body was already being pushed into the cremation furnace.

"Stop!" Nina rushed over and pushed the staff away.

She blocked the furnace. "Who told you to do this?"

"It was me!" An elderly voice said.

Emily supported Zoe as they walked in.

Zoe had lost a lot of weight, her hair now completely white, looking much less gentle than before.

It took Nina a moment to recognize her, "Zoe?"

"Nina, since Bella is gone, she should be laid to rest. Keeping her in the morgue is too harsh."

Nina found this absurd. "Zoe, is this your idea or Sebastian's? I'm Isabella's sister, and only I have the right to decide."

Zoe was so angry she couldn't catch her breath.

Suddenly, Zoe threw away her cane and knelt. "Nina, I'm begging you. Let Bella go."

Zoe, always calm, doing this startled Nina.

Emily tried to help Zoe up but couldn't.

Emily explained, "Since Sebastian hasn't woken up, Zoe was worried and brought a priest. The priest said..."

"Said what?"

"The priest said Sebastian hasn't woken up because Isabella's spirit is haunting him, so..."

"Nonsense!" Nina snapped, "Even if Bella became a ghost, she wouldn't harm Sebastian!"

Isabella was too kind; even as a ghost, she'd be a good one!

Emily fell silent.

Zoe kept crying on the ground, refusing to get up.

As the standoff continued, the door suddenly opened, and Jack walked in supporting someone.

"Sebastian!" Emily exclaimed, "You're awake?"

Emily rushed over and hugged Sebastian, crying uncontrollably, "Sebastian, you're finally awake. Thank goodness!"

This scene was jarring to Nina.

Nina turned away coldly and said to Zoe, "Zoe, now that Sebastian is awake, can you let Isabella go?"

"Sebastian, Sebastian," Zoe cried uncontrollably.

Sebastian stared blankly ahead, his eyes empty. He pushed Emily away and reached out. "Where's Bella? Where's Bella?"

"Mr. Landon." Jack supported him and led him to the cremation furnace. "Mr. Landon, Isabella is in the furnace."

Sebastian's hands groped over the furnace, gritting his teeth. "Whoever dares to burn Bella, I'll make sure they die here! Bella, I'm here! Don't be afraid! I won't let anyone hurt you."

With Jack's help, the body was pulled out.

Sebastian hugged the charred body desperately and ordered, "Jack, quick! Take Bella home."

"Yes."

Just as Jack was about to move, Zaire stopped him.

Nina's tone was calm. "Mr. Landon, please put Isabella down!"

Sebastian raised his head, his vision unfocused due to blindness. "Nina, I promised Bella I would protect her."

Nina's voice trembled, her hands clenched into fists. "If it weren't for you and Emily, would Bella have been so agitated? If she hadn't caught you in the act, would this have happened? Sebastian, you killed her! What right do you have to act now?"

Sebastian was stunned.

He sat there holding the body, as if something had shattered him completely.

Nina looked away, choking up. "She's dead now, it's too late to say anything. You and Bella weren't married, so it doesn't count. I am her only family. Mr. Landon, please stop bothering us and let Bella rest in peace!"

Sebastian shook his head. "No."

Nina directly took Isabella's body back.

Perhaps Nina's words had shattered his heart, so Sebastian hesitated and eventually let go.

Indeed.

He had no reason to hold on.

He didn't deserve it!

After Nina and the others took the body away, Sebastian fell unconscious again.

The night was calm.

Isabella got up from the bed and walked to the door.

The door was locked from the outside. She twisted the handle a few times, but it didn't budge.

Isabella looked around. Her only escape route was the open window for ventilation.

Standing by the window, Isabella looked down.

If she jumped from here, she'd be shattered to pieces!

The sea breeze blew, making Isabella's breath catch.

She hesitated for a second, then grabbed the window frame and climbed up.

###chapter 209 The Prejudice of Hatred

A strong sea breeze blew in, making Isabella stumble and almost fall out the window.

She grabbed the window frame with both hands to steady herself.

Just then, the door burst open, and Samantha ran in.

Seeing her, Isabella yelled, "Don't move!"

Samantha froze but still tried to get closer.

"If you take one more step, I'll jump!" Isabella clutched the window, her upper body leaning out.

It looked like she could fall any second.

Samantha didn't dare move, just stared wide-eyed.

Isabella said, "Get someone in charge here. You have ten minutes!"

Samantha nodded, hesitated, then ran off, probably to get help.

A few minutes later, Samantha came back with a large writing board. She wrote a message and showed it to Isabella.

[I called Leo. He's on his way. Don't do anything rash!]

Isabella glanced at the photo of Matthew on the wall and said, "Call Charles. I want to see him!"

Samantha was stunned.

Isabella suddenly let go with one hand, hanging precariously.

Samantha's face turned pale with anxiety. She quickly went to notify Charles.

Another strong sea breeze blew in, making Isabella sway.

She grabbed the window with both hands and looked down, her heart pounding.

Isabella didn't really intend to jump. She just wanted to force Charles to show up.

She couldn't stay locked up here.

Whether it worked or not, she had to try something.

Leo arrived quickly.

He rushed in, still in a suit, with unsteady steps and five clear finger marks on his face.

Seeing Isabella crouched on the window, he frowned and said, "Isabella, get down!"

"Leo, don't come any closer!" Isabella shouted.

Leo took two steps forward and then stopped abruptly.

He pressed his temple, looking pained. After a moment, he spoke again, "Isabella, if you slip and fall, you'll be shattered to pieces."

Isabella sneered. "Didn't you say I was already dead? Even if I jump now, it would just be dying again. Leo, I'm not afraid."

Seeing her determination, Leo was at a loss for words.

The sea breeze blew from behind Isabella, lifting her long hair. Behind her was the endless night, like the entrance to another world.

Indeed, if Isabella let go, she'd fall into another world.

"No!" Leo's heart tightened.

He was genuinely afraid she'd let go.

"Isabella, tell me what you want, and I'll give it to you. Just come down first, okay?" Leo coaxed gently.

Samantha stood by his side, looking at Leo with a complex expression.

Even when Leo was in love with Samantha, he had never been this cautious.

Isabella shook her head. "What I want, you can't give me. Leo. You're just Charles's lapdog!"

Leo gritted his teeth, sneering. "Yeah, you're right! And what about Sebastian? He's just like me. He got close to you just to get back at Charles and sent Matthew to prison."

"Shut up! Don't talk about him like that!"

Footsteps echoed from the door.

Isabella's eyes shifted as Charles walked in.

She hadn't seen Charles since Matthew's trial. It had only been a few months, but it felt like a lifetime.

Charles's hair had turned white. He still stood tall, but his eyes were cold.

"Isabella, don't you think about your child?" Charles's gaze was icy. "I believe you have the guts to jump, but do you have the guts to leave your child motherless?"

Isabella's eyes welled up. "Charles, I know you hate me and Sebastian because of Matthew. But Matthew's fate was his own doing. Don't make more mistakes."

"Mistakes?" Charles sneered. "What's right and wrong? It's all perspective. You side with Sebastian, so he's right! But have you ever thought about Matthew's side, or mine and Emma's? Even if Matthew was wrong, it wasn't Sebastian's place to judge him. Do you really think Sebastian loves you? You're just a pawn to get back at me!"

Isabella was confused. "Matthew paid for his actions. He only got a year in prison. Charles, Matthew is your child, and so is Sebastian!"

"I don't have a child like Sebastian!" Charles roared, eyes blazing. "Sebastian and his mother are heartless. If I'd known he'd turn out like this, I'd have strangled him at birth to stop him from causing harm!"

Isabella shook her head in disbelief, her mind reeling from the venom in his words. How could any father say such a thing? This wasn't favoritism; it was sheer, unadulterated prejudice. The intensity of Charles's hatred for Sebastian was almost tangible, making the air in the room feel heavy and charged.

She couldn't imagine the depth of Sebastian's pain if he ever heard his father's cruel wish. The thought alone was enough to make her heart ache.

Suddenly, a baby's cry came from the doorway.

Isabella's body trembled, and she looked toward the door.

Emma walked in, holding a swaddled baby.

"Bella, didn't you always want to see your child? I brought her here." Emma showed the baby's face to Isabella.

Isabella saw the tiny, tender face in the light-colored swaddle.

The baby was so small, eyes closed, mouth open, crying loudly. Her arms, bound in the swaddle, waved and struggled, searching for something.

Isabella's heart softened.

"Bella, come hold her."

Isabella bit her lip, not moving.

Charles said, "Isabella, if you die, I'll make sure this child goes with you!"

###chapter 210  The Child is Crying

'My child is still so young, only a few days old. How can I take the child to her death with me?' Isabella thought.

"Bella, the baby hasn't been named yet," Emma said. "Hold her and give her a name."

Isabella felt a sharp pain in her heart and tears streamed down her face. She jumped down from the windowsill and walked over.

Emma handed the baby to her. Isabella's eyes were glued to the baby's face.

Just as Isabella was about to take the baby, she felt a heavy blow to the back of her neck.Â Her mind buzzed, and she blacked out.

Leo reached out to catch her. "Isabella?"

He looked up, his eyes cold as he stared at Charles, who was retracting his hand.

"Isabella's just passed out, Mr. Anderson. No need to worry," Charles said calmly.

Leo picked Isabella up and placed her back on the bed. His fingers gently brushed her cheek, his eyes full of pain. "Leave the baby with her."

Charles nodded. "Mr. Anderson, I thought the same."

He gave Emma a look, and Emma handed the baby to Samantha.

Charles then instructed her,"Take good care of them. If anything happens to IsabellaÂ or the baby, your life will be over."

Samantha shivered, lowered her head, and carefully took the baby.

Isabella slept through the entire night. In her daze, she seemed to hear the sound of a baby crying. The sound seemed to be right next to her ear, yet also far away.

A vision of the baby's tender face flashed in Isabella's mind, and she suddenly woke up. She sat up straight in bed. "My baby!"

Samantha quickly handed the baby over.

Isabella stared at the baby for a second. Then she reacted, reaching out to take the swaddled baby and hold her tightly in her arms.

"Is this my baby?" Isabella asked Samantha.

Samantha nodded.

A trace of doubt crossed Isabella's mind. She hadn't seen the baby since giving birth. It was clear that Charles wanted to use the baby to control her.

But why was Charles willing to return the baby to her now? Was Charles afraid she would really jump, so he brought the baby back?

Isabella's mind was racing. The baby in her arms made a soft sound.

The child was still very young and couldn't yet speak, but the cooing sounds she made were the most enchanting melodies to Isabella.

As Isabella remembered Emma's words, she gave the baby a name, Stella Landon.

Isabella gently touched Stella's round cheeks, a tender smile appearing on her lips. "Sweetie."

It was late at night. Isabella stood by the window, holding the baby, and looked up at the crescent moon in the sky. She whispered, "Sebastian, this is our daughter. I named her Stella Landon, and her nickname is Sweetie. Do you think it sounds nice?"

Sebastian woke up from a nightmare. All he saw was darkness. He raised his hand, but he still couldn't see anything.

He was blind. Sebastian could accept this fact. But he couldn't accept that Isabella was dead.

These days, Sebastian's heart ached, whether he was awake or asleep.

He threw off the covers and tried to get out of bed, but because he couldn't see, he fell straight to the floor.

The door opened, and hurried footsteps approached. A soft hand supported his arm.

Sebastian grabbed the hand tightly, his empty eyes staring at the person. "Bella?"

The person stiffened and said, "It's me, Emily."

Sebastian was stunned. His senses had become dull. Maybe it was because he had just woken up, or maybe it was because of his blindness.

Otherwise, how could he not have smelled the difference between Emily and Isabella? Sebastian let go of her hand in despair.

"I'll help you up," Emily said.

Sebastian pulled his hand back and said coldly, "No need. You can go."

He stood up from the floor and groped his way forward.

Since losing his sight, Sebastian couldn't even tell where he was going. He had only taken two steps when Emily exclaimed, "Be careful."

Sebastian's knee hit the edge of the coffee table hard, and he fell to the ground.

"Sebastian!" Emily rushed over. "Where are you going? Let me help you."

"No!" Sebastian pushed her away, gritting his teeth as he stood up. Ignoring the pain in his knee, he continued to feel his way forward.

Emily thought Sebastian was trying to leave, but he was heading in the wrong direction.

She couldn't help but say, "Sebastian, you're going the wrong way. The door is over there."

But Sebastian seemed not to hear her, continuing to feel his way forward.

From the bed to the floor-to-ceiling window, a distance of just a few steps took Sebastian several minutes.

When his fingers finally touched the window, Sebastian's face lit up with joy. He opened the door and walked out.

Despite tripping over the clutter on the balcony multiple times, he never stopped, heading straight for the railing.

"Sebastian!" Emily rushed over and hugged his waist. "Sebastian, don't do anything rash! Isabella's death was an accident. You still have Zoe to take care of. Isabella wouldn't want to see you like this!"

Sebastian didn't move, standing still like a statue.

Emily cried for a while before realizing something was wrong.

Sebastian was looking up at the sky, his body tense like a stone.

Emily glanced up at the sky. "Sebastian, what are you looking at?"

Sebastian suddenly let out a soft laugh, as if talking to himself or to Emily. "Did you hear that?"

Emily held her breath and listened for a while but heard nothing. She couldn't help but ask, "Hear what?"

"The baby is crying."

Emily was stunned. Sebastian's simple words gave her goosebumps.

She grasped Sebastian's hand tightly and looked around.

The villa was surrounded by greenery, and it was very quiet, even during the day.

There was no sound of a baby crying!

"Sebastian, you're confused." Emily tried to pull him back inside, but Sebastian stood still, not moving an inch.

Emily had no choice but to stand quietly beside him.

Sebastian stood on the balcony for two hours, maintaining his posture of looking up at the sky, sometimes crying, sometimes laughing.

The breeze blew, and Emily felt a chill all over.

Two hours later, Sebastian fainted from the cold.

When the doctor arrived, Emily's unease grew.

She quietly went to the bathroom and made a phone call.

When the call connected, Emily immediately asked, "Is the baby dead?"

The person on the other end hesitated for a long time before saying, "It seems not."

Emily frowned. "What about Isabella?"

"Not sure."

Emily narrowed her eyes. "Looks like I've been played!"

At the Jose family, Nina had just entered the room when she smelled a familiar scent in the air.

A tall figure appeared at the door, snatched the doorknob from her hand, locked the door, and pulled her into an embrace.

The whole movement was done in one fluid motion.

###chapter 211 Might as Well Kill You

Richard lowered his head and kissed her lips.

Nina stiffened for a moment, but when she remembered she needed something from Richard, she willingly raised her arms, embraced him, and reciprocated his kiss.

They kissed all the way from the doorway to the bed.

Nina was pressed into the soft covers and suddenly felt a tightness in her chest. She opened her eyes abruptly. "Mr. Cole!"

Richard's hand stopped, his dark eyes deeply gazing at Nina.

"Did you find anything?" Nina asked.

"I did." Richard said.

Nina's heart leaped with joy, her eyes brightening."Is there really a problem?"

"There is." Richard replied.

"That's great! I knew it." Nina was so excited that she grabbed Richard's sleeve. "Where is Bella? Are she and the child okay?"

Richard said, "I haven't found that much yet. The only thing I can confirm is that the car accident was deliberate, which leaves many questions unanswered."

"What about Bella?"

Richard looked at her. "Do you think I'm so powerful that I can find out so quickly?"

Nina was taken aback. She thought about how Zaire had been investigating for so long without finding anything, but Richard had already found clues as soon as he got involved. "I'm sorry. I'm just anxious."

Richard smirked. "You worry about the wrong things!" His hand moved.

Nina immediately felt a current run through her body. Through her clothes, she pressed his hand, her face flushing with embarrassment. "Mr. Cole, you haven't found Bella for me yet. This shouldn't be happening."

Richard was indifferent. Even though Nina was pressing his hand, his fingers could still move.

He pinched gently, and Nina couldn't help but tremble and get a bit angry. "Mr. Cole!"

Richard stopped, withdrew his hand, and kissed her lightly. "You're already divorced, why are you still so sensitive?"

Nina was speechless. He was acting as if he was losing out by touching her.

Nina turned her head away, feeling slightly uncomfortable because of Richard's words."I'm not only divorced, but I've also had a miscarriage. I'm worthless now. If you despise me, you don't have to force yourself to do anything!"

Richard was silent. He turned Nina's face toward him, his deep gaze sweeping over her face inch by inch. This tough man was now full of tenderness, and even his voice softened unconsciously. "Sorry, I don't know what to say, and I made you unhappy."

Nina lowered her eyes and didn't look at him. "You're telling the truth. Mr. Cole, I know I have nothing. I'm grateful that you're willing to help me. If you have any requests, I'll do my best to fulfill them. There's no need to force yourself to do anything with me."

"I'm not forcing myself to do anything." Richard's thumb caressed her face.

His fingers were rough, and had thick and hard calluses. Although Nina's skin wasn't particularly delicate, it was much better compared to Richard. Therefore, when his thumb brushed, Nina felt a slight pain.

She grabbed Richard's hand and noticed many small scars on the back of his hand and fingers.

"What are these?" Nina was shocked.

The scars looked old and varied in size, like a pile of centipedes covering Richard's entire hand.

Nina didn't dare count how many there were!

A trace of inferiority flashed in Richard's eyes. He clenched his hand into a fist. "Just some old scars."

Nina opened her mouth but didn't ask any more questions.

She knew about Richard's connection with the top casino and that he wasn't a good person. She privately wanted to stay away from such a dangerous figure.

Staying away meant not asking about him, not talking to him, and not understanding him.

She had always done this with Richard.

But right now, Nina couldn't help but want to ask about the origin of those scars.

In the blink of an eye, two weeks passed.

While Richard and Zaire were investigating the car accident, Charles started causing trouble for the Landon Group. In just half a month, he had taken over half of the Landon Group's assets. Rumors about the Landon Group going bankrupt were everywhere, and internal personnel were in disarray, with many resigning.

Zaire see to find Sebastian in the evening. He parked the car, didn't turn off the engine, and rushed into the house.

Emily was carrying a meal upstairs when she saw him and paused. "Zaire, why are you here?"

Zaire glanced at her. "I'm looking for Sebastian."

"Sebastian is upstairs..."

Before she could finish, Zaire was already striding upstairs.

Emily was stunned for a moment before quickly following.

Zaire kicked open the bedroom door, strode to the corner, and yanked up the figure sitting on the floor. "Sebastian, have you had enough of being down? Do you still want the Landon Group?"

Sebastian was limp and just let Zaire pull him up. No matter what Zaire said, Sebastian didn't react at all.

"Sebastian!"

Zaire roared in anger and punched Sebastian in the face.

The punch was so hard that Zaire's hand hurt. But Sebastian didn't make a sound.

"Living like this is no different from being dead. If that's the case, I'll just beat you to death today and give you a quick end!" Zaire got angrier as he spoke, punching Sebastian again and again. Sebastian didn't cry out in pain or even try to dodge.

Emily rushed over and pulled Zaire back. "Enough!"

She shielded Sebastian in her arms. "Zaire, he's already turned out like this. Just let him go!"

"Let him go?" Zaire sneered. "I'd love to let him go, but can he let himself go?"

Emily was silent.

Since Isabella "died," Sebastian was no longer the Sebastian he used to be.

Emily always thought time was a healer that could cure all wounds.

But now it seemed that time was a medicine, but not necessarily a good one. It could also be poison.

Some wounds couldn't fade with time. When a person lost the will to live, every second they lived might be torture. Sebastian was like that.

Emily was deeply shocked. She hadn't realized Sebastian loved Isabella so deeply.

Suddenly, Zaire grabbed Sebastian's collar again, pulling him up and dragging him out.

Emily snapped back to reality and chased after them. "Zaire, where are you taking him?"

Zaire said nothing and quickly dragged Sebastian downstairs. In a few steps, they were outside. He opened the car door, shoved Sebastian into the passenger seat, buckled the seatbelt, then got in himself and sped off.

When Emily ran out, she could only see the taillights disappearing at the end of the road.

The car sped onto the highway, the accelerator pressed to the floor, the scenery outside blurring to the extreme.

Zaire gripped the steering wheel tightly, his jaw clenched.

In contrast, Sebastian sat quietly in the passenger seat, his face showing no panic, only relief.

Zaire glanced at him, gritted his teeth, and drove onto the ramp. He slammed on the brakes, causing the tires to smoke.

###chapter 212 Zero IQ

Sebastian was violently thrown forward by the inertia of the car, only to be yanked back by the seatbelt and slammed heavily into the seat.

Gasping for breath and nearly driven to madness, Zaire exclaimed,"Are you really trying to get yourself killed?"

Sebastian smirked. "What's the point of living like this?"

Zaire was at his wit's end. He punched the steering wheel."You may want to die, but I don't want to lose my life!"

Sebastian's lips tightened. "Take me to the hospital. I want to be with her in the morgue."

Zaire sneered. "What, you're deeply attached to a stranger's corpse?"

Sebastian remained silent, seemingly not processing the situation.

Zaire said, "Isabella might not be dead."

As he said that, he stared intently at Sebastian's face.

Indeed, within mere seconds, a subtle expression emerged on Sebastian's deathly pale face.

Sebastian slowly turned his head, his lifeless eyes fixed on Zaire. "Was the car accident staged by Charles? Then Bella isn't dead, and the body in the hospital isn't hers. So Where is Bella? Is she okay?"

Zaire raised his hand to his forehead, finally letting out a sigh of relief. "I thought you'd lost your mind."

The fact that Sebastian could analyze the situation in such a short time showed that his mind was still intact.

Sebastian grabbed his hand, his face slightly flushed with tension. "What did you find out?"

Zaire rolled his eyes. "I'm too lazy to tell you. Weren't you going to the hospital to hold that charred body? I'll take you there right now."

With that, he made a move to start the car.

"Zaire!" Sebastian growled, " What did you find out?" He was genuinely angry.

Zaire shook his head internally. All of Sebastian's composure crumbled when it came to Isabella.

'Love really is a killer. I vow to be a rational man, never to be trapped by love!' Zaire thought.

Men trapped by love were very pitiful!

Pulling his thoughts back, Zaire said, "Richard found some traces of evidence at the accident scene, enough to prove it was staged. According to his assessment, the accident wasn't severe enough to rupture the fuel tank, let alone cause such a big explosion and fire. He's submitted the evidence to the relevant authorities, but verification will take some time."

Sebastian frowned deeply, leaning back in his seat, his mind racing. "They saved Bella for ulterior motives, so they found a sacrificial substitute; Bella is still alive." His tone was now very certain.

Sebastian knew Charles too well. This car accident was just a test by Charles.

It had been effective enough that he had been seen in a lot of pain after losing Isabella; they wouldn't let Isabella die so easily.

After all, if they held a trump card, they could deliver a fatal blow at a critical moment!

Zaire nodded in agreement. "So I guess Charles has more tricks up his sleeve. Sebastian, you can't keep being so down."

Sebastian didn't respond to this, remaining silent for a long time before letting out a low laugh.

Isabella wasn't dead. His world was lit up again

Zaire knew Sebastian was saved when he saw him laugh.

Zaire started the car. "I'll take you home."

"No!" Sebastian interrupted him, "Take me to the hospital."

Zaire was stunned. "What, do you still want to go back and cry over that charred body?"

"Since I need to act, I have to play the whole part," Sebastian said. "If I don't act convincingly, how will Charles believe it?"

Zaire raised an eyebrow and cursed. "You really are something!"

Emily sat quietly, coldly watching the elegant woman across from her.

The woman placed a cup of freshly brewed tea in front of Emily and said, "Miss Lopez, try it. This is new tea from this year, and it tastes quite good."

Emily glanced at the tea in the cup and said indifferently, "I don't know how to appreciate tea, Mrs. Landon. You're too kind."

Emma looked at her and smiled. She didn't stand on ceremony with Emily and took a small sip of tea herself, curling her lips in satisfaction. " It really is new tea, with a freshness that old tea lacks."

Putting down the teacup, Emma continued, "Living and appreciating tea are actually the same. Miss Lopez, do you understand this principle?"

"Mrs. Landon, I came to see you today to ask why Isabella is still alive." Emily didn't want to beat around the bush and asked, "We agreed that Isabella would die in that fire. Mrs. Landon, you broke your promise."

Facing Emily's question, Emma just smiled faintly. "This brings me to my second point. To live comfortably in this world, you must have something in your hands. This car accident had a significant impact on Sebastian, and since you're by his side every day, you must see it more clearly than anyone. Do you know? The old Sebastian had no weaknesses. That's why he dared to take risks and build the Landon Group at such a young age. Now that he has a weakness, we just need to lift a finger to bring him down."

Emily stood up abruptly. "Are you saying you want to take over Landon Group?"

Emma glanced at her. "How can there be two Landon Groups in Lakina?"

"You've gone too far!" Emily said. "Sebastian is now blind and is living in pain every day. His future is bleak. Isn't that enough?"

"It's not enough, of course!" Emma gripped the teacup tightly. "Since he sent Matthew to prison, I want to kill him a thousand times!"

Emily shook her head, knowing that reasoning with Emma was futile.

She said seriously, "Mrs. Landon, we agreed that I want Isabella dead!"

Emma smiled faintly. "Miss Lopez, to be blunt, you're just a pawn in our game. Do you really think you can negotiate with me? Cooperation means both parties are equally capable. Miss Lopez, what have you contributed to this game?"

Emily was at a loss for words.

She really hadn't contributed much.

Even though she successfully drugged Sebastian, he had never touched her!

Emma looked away and continued brewing tea. "Tea loses its flavor after two brews. It's tasteless, but a pity to discard. Miss Lopez, if you don't do something soon, you'll end up discarded and out of the game."

Emily was shaken and clenched her fists. "My original intention remains the same. I can give up everything; I just want Sebastian!"

Emma nodded, her gaze appreciative. "Young people should dare to think and act. Now is when Sebastian is most vulnerable. You might be able to replace Isabella and become an indispensable part of his life."

Emily was still pondering the meaning of her words when she heard Emma say, "Do what you want to do. Hesitation will only make you lose opportunities. It's better to take a risk than to regret it later."

###chapter 213  Cremation

As soon as Emily came out, she received a call from Zoe.

"Emily, where are you?"

Emily replied, "Zoe, I'm out shopping. What's up?"

"Hurry to the hospital! Sebastian went to the morgue again!"

Emily frowned."Okay, Zoe. Don't worry. I'll be there right away."

After hanging up, Emily headed straight to the hospital morgue.

As she reached the entrance, she saw several cars driving past.

The cars in front were all from the Jose family.

The last car, however, was Sebastian's.

The window was half-open, and Emily saw that Jack was driving.

Without thinking much, she quickly turned around and followed them.

The convoy drove all the way to the funeral home.

The Jose family members got out one by one, and Jack helped Sebastian out, following the others inside.

Emily quickly parked her car and walked in the same direction.

Inside, she saw the Jose family members circling a flower bed in mourning.

In the center, surrounded by flowers, was the charred body that had been in the hospital morgue for over half a month.

Emily was stunned. Was this a memorial service?

Were they going to cremate the body?

But Nina hadn't wanted to cremate it, right?

Why the sudden change?

Before Emily could finish her thought, she saw Jack helping Sebastian walk over.

At that moment, a funeral home staff member came over and moved the charred body onto a stretcher, seemingly to take it to the crematorium.

"Bella, Bella!" Sebastian's voice echoed in the empty hall, each cry filled with immense sorrow.

Jack helped him over, and Sebastian staggered and fell onto the charred body.

Sebastian hugged the body tightly, his body slightly bent, trembling uncontrollably.

Nina stood watching silently, her eyes vacant, as though her spirit had reached the pinnacle of desolation, without shedding a single tear.

The men from the Jose family remained relatively calm.

Margaret and Kelsey were crying bitterly. But they only wiped their tears silently without making a sound, perhaps to avoid making Sebastian more upset.

Next to Zaire stood a woman in black.

Emily had seen her once before, her name seemed to be Miley, and her eyes were swollen from crying.

Zaire raised a hand, putting it around Miley's shoulder, silently comforting her.

The entire hall was silent, filled with an overwhelming atmosphere of sorrow.

It wasn't until Sebastian said his final goodbye to the charred body that Jack and Zaire came over to pull him away.

The staff pushed the stretcher toward the crematorium.

"Bella!" Sebastian's hoarse voice erupted as he suddenly broke free from Zaire and Jack's grip, aimlessly rushing forward.

Unfortunately, he stumbled and hit his forehead directly on the corner of the stretcher with a loud bang.

The sound made everyone's hearts skip a beat.

"Mr. Landon!" Jack's voice trembled.

Everyone watched the scene, frozen in shock.

"Bella." Sebastian, with blood streaming from his head, propped himself up and climbed onto the stretcher.

In front of everyone, he hugged the charred body as if it were the most precious thing in the world, handling it with extreme care.

"Mr. Landon."

His back was to Emily, so she couldn't see Sebastian's expression, but she heard him say slowly, "I want to go with Bella. Please burn me with her."

"Mr. Landon!" Jack's eyes widened in disbelief.

Sebastian slowly closed his eyes.

His figure was resolute, as if he truly intended to turn to ashes with "Isabella."

"Sebastian!" said an elderly voice, and Zoe, leaning on a cane, walked in shakily.

When she saw the scene in the middle of the hall, she almost lost her breath.

Emily quickly went over to support her. "Zoe."

Zoe walked to the stretcher, tears streaming down her face. "Sebastian, you can't leave me. "

No matter how much she cried and pleaded, Sebastian showed no reaction.

Jack said, "Mr. Landon seems to have fainted."

Zoe was startled and quickly said, "Hurry, take Sebastian back!"

"Yes, Mrs. Landon." Jack didn't dare delay and quickly carried Sebastian out.

Zoe bowed three times to "Isabella" and said to the charred body, "Bella, I'll apologize to you in person when I join you. Rest in peace."

Emily also bowed slightly, but her mind was preoccupied with another matter.

She supported Zoe as they walked out. At the door, Emily suddenly looked back.

The room was still filled with sorrow, with no sign of anything unusual.

In the car, Zoe asked Jack to drive home.

Zoe was overcome with emotion when she thought about the charred body, and she couldn't control herself and cried all the way home.

"Emily, if it weren't for your timely intervention, Sebastian would have been lost to us." Zoe said.

Emily shook her head. "Zoe, I just didn't want Sebastian to act impulsively and do something he'd regret."

Emily had seen it clearly. If Zoe hadn't come, no one in the Jose family would have stopped Sebastian from following through with his plan.

Fortunately, Emily had sensed something was wrong and notified Zoe in time. Otherwise, Luke might not have listened to her in that situation.

Zoe had arrived just in time, and the whole incident ended without any major mishaps.

But for some reason, Emily still felt something was off.

She thought about it carefully but couldn't pinpoint what it was.

Inside the funeral home.

Nina looked away as the charred body was pushed into the crematorium.

Even though she knew it wasn't Isabella, it was still two lives.

Who knew how heartless the Landon family had become to find someone else to take the fall!

Those had been two living lives!

Nina couldn't bear it.

She turned to Zaire and asked, "Why was Sebastian here?"

This wasn't part of their plan.

Richard had said that they could only make Charles lower his guard by cremating the body .

Otherwise, Isabella might remain hidden.

Nina also thought it was time to let the person rest in peace.

So, after the police collected evidence from the body, she agreed to cremate it.

Nina didn't inform Sebastian.

Whether the body was Isabella's or not, she wouldn't inform Sebastian.

It wasn't necessary.

But Sebastian still came.

This puzzled Nina. After she thought it over, she realized that the only person who could have informed Sebastian was Zaire.

Zaire didn't hide it and said, "I told him."

Nina frowned. "Did you tell him about the car accident too?"

Remembering Sebastian's instructions, Zaire shook his head. "No."

Nina nodded. "This is about my family. He doesn't need to know!"

Zaire hesitated but still wanted to speak for Sebastian, "Nina, about that night..."

Before he could finish, Nina suddenly walked toward the door.

###chapter 214 Wait

Zaire was taken aback, thinking Nina was angry. But when he saw Richard walking in from the doorway, he instantly breathed a sigh of relief.

For some reason, Zaire was a bit afraid of Nina. Zaire used to be the oldest in the family, and Kelsey was the youngest. Although Kelsey was a bit spoiled and mischievous, and sometimes even Steven and Margaret couldn't handle her, he, as the older brother, could still manage her.

Now that Nina was back, he had become the second child, and he felt quite concerned about Nina, since he was afraid that she might be unhappy or ignore him.

"What brings you here?" Nina asked, walking up to Richard.

Richard glanced over, made eye contact with Zaire, and nodded slightly. Then he answered Nina, "I was worried, so I came to check on you."

"What are you worried about?" Nina immediately became tense. "Has the Landon family done anything?"

Richard said, "Look at you! You've become very tense."

Nina exhaled. "I can't be at ease until we find Bella."

"There has been some progress, so relax a bit," Richard comforted her.

"Okay."

Sebastian locked himself in his room after waking up.

Worried that Sebastian might do something rash, Zoe assigned two servants to guard the door.

At lunchtime, Zoe looked at the table full of delicious food but had no appetite at all.

"Zoe, you should at least eat something." Emily filled a bowl of soup and placed it in front of Zoe.

Zoe shook her head but suddenly noticed a bruise on the back of Emily's hand.

"What happened to you?" Zoe asked, grabbing her wrist.

"It's nothing." Emily smiled and pulled her hand back.

At this moment, a servant nearby interjected, "Mrs. Landon, Miss Lopez personally made this soup. She said you haven't been eating well these days, so she made some appetizing soup herself. Miss Lopez even burned her hand in the process."

"Stop talking!" Emily interrupted.

The servant lowered her head and said no more.

Zoe looked at her with a complex expression. "Emily, you've really had a hard time."

Zoe had lived a long life and had seen everything.

So Emily's little tricks couldn't fool Zoe.

Zoe also understood that Emily was trying to please her for Sebastian's sake.

"Emily, you and I both know how Sebastian feels about Isabella. Although I like you and hope you can stay by Sebastian's side, you saw what happened today. Isabella is gone, and I'm afraid Sebastian won't be into anyone. You're a good girl, and I can't take advantage your feelings to make you stay with Sebastian who is heartbroken. You've worked hard during this time, and I've prepared a small gift for you as a token of my gratitude. Pack your things, and I'll have the driver take you home this afternoon."

Emily shook her head and knelt down with a thud.

Zoe was shocked.

Emily leaned on her knees and said, "Zoe, I'm willing to stay with Sebastian.I know Sebastian is reluctant to open his heart, but I don't regret it, nor will I complain. I just ask you not to send me away. No matter what happens to Sebastian, I just want to stay by his side. Even if I get nothing, I'm willing to be with him!"

"But this is unfair to you. You're still young; there's no need for this."

Emily started to kowtow. "Zoe, please don't send me away, please."

Zoe sighed and was about to speak when Emily suddenly covered her mouth and nose and rushed into the bathroom.

The sound of dry heaving came from the bathroom. Zoe was stunned.

Zoe quickly got up and walked over. When she watched Emily dry heave in front of the sink, a suspicion slowly grew in her heart.

After Emily finished, Zoe asked, "Emily, are you..."

Emily lowered her eyes in embarrassment.Â "Zoe, I'm pregnant with Sebastian's child."

"What?" Zoe was both shocked and delighted. She grabbed Emily's hand tightly."Are you serious? When did this happen between you and Sebastian?"

Emily said, "It was the night Isabella had the car accident. Sebastian and I were an accident. Emma brought Isabella over and caught us. Actually, I'm alsoÂ  responsible for Isabella's accident. If we hadn't fallen into a trap, Isabella wouldn't have had the accident."

Zoe shook her head."You can't be blamed for this. It's wonderful that you're pregnant!"

Emily lowered her head. "But I don't plan to keep this child."

"Why?" Zoe's face stiffened, and she became tense. "Why don't you want it? Don't you like Sebastian? Don't you want his child?"

Emily shook her head. "No! Zoe, I like Sebastian a lot, and I'm so happy to be pregnant with his child. But I'm afraid Sebastian won't want this child."

"Don't worry! I'll take care of it."

"Zoe..."

"As long as I'm here, Sebastian won't abandon you and the child."

Emily nodded, tears welling up in her eyes. "Thank you, Zoe."

That night, Zoe went to see Sebastian.

She said, "I need you to marry Emily."

Sebastian stiffened and said decisively, "I won't marry her!"

"Are you out of your mind? Do you know that Emily is pregnant?" Emily asked.

Sebastian did not react.

"I asked her, and she said the child is yours. Sebastian, the dead are gone, but the living must go on. Can you really bear to abandon this child? Can you really bear to see me leave this world with regret?"

Sebastian finally looked up, but his voice was still cold. "Grandma, I never touched Emily. The child is not mine."

Zoe was stunned. "How is that possible?"

"I can assure you that Emily is not pregnant. If you don't believe me, you can call Marvin over."

Zoe hesitated for a moment, "Okay, Emily said she was pregnant, but since you said she wasn't, let's have Marvin check."

One phone call later, Marvin arrived quickly.

After the examination, he said, "Mrs. Landon, Mr. Landon, Miss Lopez is not pregnant."

Zoe was greatly shocked and looked at Emily in disappointment.

Emily bit her lip and knelt down again with a thud. "I'm sorry, Zoe. I was afraid you'd send me away, so I lied. I'm sorry."

Sebastian said emotionlessly, "Jack."

"Mr. Landon."

"Take Miss Lopez home."

"Alright."

Jack responded and walked up to Emily. "Miss Lopez, please follow me."

"Zoe!" Emily cried out.

A trace of conflict flashed in Zoe's eyes, and she hurriedly stood up. "Wait!"

"Grandma!" Sebastian's voice deepened.

Sebastian's attitude was firm. If Zoe insisted on keeping Emily, he would move out!

###chapter 215  Last Words

"Sebastian, Emily loves you just as much as Isabella did. Can't you just..."

"No way!" Sebastian stood up. " Do you have to keep her here?"

Zoe hesitated for a moment and said, "What if I say yes?"

"Jack, pack up! We're moving out."

"Sebastian!" Zoe trembled with anger.

Sebastian remained resolute. "If you insist on keeping her, then I will leave."

With that,Â Sebastian went upstairs. He had only taken a couple of steps when he heard Emily's startled cry from behind, "Zoe!"

"Zoe has been consumed by anxiety and hasn't shown any improvement despite taking medication." Marvin said gravely. "Mr. Landon, you must brace yourself."

Sebastian's body shook, and he stumbled back a couple of steps. "Zoe has always been healthy. How could this happen so suddenly...?"

Emily said, "Ever since your accident, Zoe has suffered several blows. Sebastian, you have no idea that while you were in agony over Isabella, Zoe was in a lot of pain too!"

Sebastian pressed his lips together, his face turning pale.

Zoe never recovered from her illness.

As Zoe's condition worsened day by day, Sebastian's anxiety reached its peak.

That night, Emily suddenly knocked urgently on his door."Sebastian, Zoe is not going to make it. She wants to see you one last time!"

When Sebastian rushed to the side of the bed, Zoe was barely hanging on. "Sebastian."

"Grandma!" Sebastian knelt by the bed, holding Zoe's wrinkled hand, sobbing uncontrollably.

"Sebastian, I think I have to go. I won't be able to take care of you anymore."

Sebastian shook his head but couldn't say a word.

"Emily," Zoe called.

"Zoe." Emily walked over.

Zoe took her hand and placed it on Sebastian's hand.

"Sebastian, do you understand what I mean?"

Sebastian lowered his head and remained silent.

Emily cried, "Zoe, don't say that. You will definitely get better."

"Sebastian." Zoe tried to sit up, but even a slight movement exhausted her.

Zoe struggled, her face ashen, but she held on, waiting for Sebastian's response.

"How ungrateful!" A voice suddenly scolded from the doorway. Charles and Emma walked in.

"Zoe!" Emma cried out.

Charles stood by the bed, looking at Zoe. "Mom, don't worry. Sebastian is my son. Since I neglected to discipline him when he was young, which led to his current behavior, I will take good care of him. I heard your last wish. Don't worry! I will handle their marriage."

Zoe nodded, finally exhaling her last breath and closing her eyes.

"Mom!"

"Zoe!"

The room was filled with cries of sorrow.

Sebastian knelt on the ground, feeling as if he were in an ice cellar, his whole body cold.

A thunderclap roared. Isabella woke up from her dream, instinctively hugging the child in her arms. But her hands only grasped a cold piece of clothing.

Isabella sat up abruptly, realizing that the child who had been lying in her arms was gone.

Another thunderclap flashed outside the window.

Such thunder was rare in winter.

The room was dark, and when the lightning briefly illuminated the room, Isabella saw someone sitting on the sofa.

She stumbled over. "Leo, where is my child?"

Leo stood up, walked to her, and reached out to hug her.

Isabella pushed him away forcefully. "Give me back my child!"

"Isabella!" Leo hugged her again.

This time, he held her tightly.

No matter how much Isabella struggled, he didn't let go.

"Isabella, come with me, I'll take you away, okay?"

"We'll go abroad and find a secluded place to live, just you and me, okay?"

Isabella smelled the alcohol on him and said coldly, "Are you crazy?"

"Yes, I am crazy!" Leo gripped her shoulders, looking down at Isabella. "Isabella, come with me. I will treat you well!"

"Leo, I will never go with you, even if I die!"

"What about the child?" Leo said, "Don't you care if the child lives or dies?"

Isabella froze, tears welling up in her eyes. "Leo, the child is innocent. She's so young. How can you be so heartless? I'm begging you, give me back my child. You can lock me up for as long as you want and I promise I won't escape. I just want my child, okay?"

Leo gritted his teeth."Would you do anything for the child?"

Isabella nodded without hesitation. "I would!"

"What if I asked you to marry me?"

Isabella froze, tears streaming down her face. "What did you say?"

Leo held her shoulders, enunciating each word. "Marry me. I promise the child will be fine. Would you agree to that?"

Isabella shook her head.

"You won't?" Leo's eyes darkened, and his hands that were on Isabella's shoulders gradually loosened.

He took a few steps back. "If that's the case, then I can't guarantee anything."

With that, Leo walked away decisively.

Isabella felt a void in her heart. Without thinking, she reached out and grabbed Leo's wrist.

Leo stopped and looked back at her.

Isabella's face was tear-streaked, and her eyes were filled with obvious conflict.Â "If we get married, will the child come back to me?"

Leo shook his head. "The child is with Charles. Isabella, he wants us to do this. You have no choice, and neither do I. You're right, I'm just a tool he's using to get back at Sebastian, and so are you. Charles has gone mad with revenge. If we don't do as he says, I'm afraid you'll never see the child again in this lifetime!"

Isabella cried uncontrollably.

Before she had seen Sweetie, she might have been able to die without hesitation.

But these past few days, her heart had been softened by Sweetie lying in her arms every day.

Now, just thinking about Sweetie made her heart ache.

Isabella understood why they had returned the child to her for a few days.

They knew that as long as she was attached to Sweetie, she would obediently comply.

Leo hugged her, his arms tight around Isabella's shoulders. "Isabella, let's get married. I will get the Anderson group, and you can protect your child. We each get what we need."

Isabella closed her eyes in despair and finally nodded.

A flash of joy appeared in Leo's eyes. "You agree?"

Tears streamed down Isabella's face as she grabbed Leo's hand. "Leo, don't hurt the child. She's still so young."

Leo hugged her again. "Don't worry! Charles promised me that as long as we get married and you sever ties with Sebastian, after two years, he will return the child to you."

###chapter 216 FiancÃ©

Three days later, it was "Isabella"'s funeral.

The night before, Richard brought news.

"We've found Isabella!"

Nina jumped up and walked over, her legs inexplicably weak.

She grabbed Richard's hand, her palm cold. "Where is she?"

Richard supported her and said, "In a villa under Charles's name."

"Charles's villa?" Zaire was puzzled. "But I already checked all the villas under his and Emma's names, including those under Matthew's name. I found nothing."

"We were looking in the wrong direction," Richard said. "We were checking properties under the names of the living, but we forgot that even the deceased have assets that haven't been transferred yet."

"The deceased?" Zaire was even more confused. "What do you mean?"

"My people found that there was still a villa under the name of Sebastian's deceased mother. It's a seaside villa on the outskirts of the city." Richard said.

Zaire really had to hand it to Richard.

Zaire had checked all the properties of everyone close to Charles, even his secretary and butler. He just hadn't thought to check Sebastian's mother!

Nina couldn't make sense of it and didn't want to. She only cared about one thing. "Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get Bella."

Everyone else stood up as well.

Richard held her hand and said, "I've already made arrangements. You just stay home and wait."

He couldn't bear to let Nina put herself in danger.

Nina shook her head. "Let me go. If I stay home, I'll be miserable."

Zaire said, "Let her go. I'll go with her. Sebastian can't come out now, so I'll have Jack bring some people along. If we run into any trouble, we won't be helpless."

Richard hesitated.

Nina squeezed his hand, looking at him with urgency and hope.

"Alright." Richard finally nodded.

Kelsey immediately jumped in. "I want to go too!"

Zaire was a bit annoyed. "Kelsey, you stay home with Mom and Dad and wait for news from us!"

"No way!" Kelsey wouldn't listen to him and immediately turned to Nina for help. "Nina, I want to go get Bella too!"

Nina hesitated for only two seconds before nodding in agreement.

"Nina is the best!" Kelsey said, making a face at Zaire to show her displeasure.

Zaire was speechless.

In the end, he was the one who was left out.

Nina almost ignored Richard. She thought she should ask his opinion.Â "Is it okay?"

"Mr. Cole will definitely listen to you," Kelsey said, winking at Richard.

Richard smiled. "Of course."

A large group of people set off.

When they arrived at the villa, everything was quiet.

The lights were bright inside the villa.

Michael went up and rang the doorbell. The people hiding around were ready to rush in.

A few seconds later, the door opened.

Just as everyone was about to rush in, Michael made a gesture to stop them.

The sea breeze howled past, and at that moment, dozens of eyes in the yard were all focused on the person inside the door.

"Bella!" Nina shouted, her voice overwhelmed by the wind.

"Nina." Isabella walked out from inside.

Isabella was very thin, her swollen belly gone. The wind wasn't strong, but it seemed like it could blow her away.

Nina hurried over and hugged her. "Bella, you're alive! That's great!"

Isabella shook her head. "I'm sorry I made you worry."

"It's okay. It's okay." Nina let go of her, her eyes falling on Isabella's belly. "You..."

"The baby is gone," Isabella said flatly, her eyes downcast, looking very sad.

Nina choked up, forcing her tears back. "It's okay. You're still young. You'll have more children in the future. "

Isabella nodded.

While Nina and Isabella were talking, Michael had already led his people into the villa.

Soon, they brought Leo out.

Michael kicked him, and Leo knelt on one knee.

"Richard," Michael looked at Richard, waiting for his orders.

Richard glanced at Leo and said calmly, "Mr. Kevin Anderson gave me a sum of money to make sure I take care of Mr. Leo Anderson. Michael, personally escort Mr. Anderson to his final end."

Michael smirked. "This is my specialty. Mr. Anderson, do you have any last words?"

Leo looked at Richard and sneered. "How much did Kevin Anderson give you? I'll pay triple!"

Michael laughed out loud. "Everyone knows that Mr. Kevin Anderson is the future heir of the Anderson group. Mr. Kevin Anderson owns the Anderson group. What do you have, Mr. Leo Anderson?"

Leo said nothing and just looked at Richard.

Richard raised an eyebrow. "Mr. Anderson, our services aren't cheap."

Leo lifted his chin. "I can afford it."

Michael laughed wildly.

Kelsey couldn't help but look at Michael. She thought that Michael, who was dressed in black and standing in the night, exuded a menacing aura that made people inexplicably afraid.

"Mr. Anderson, if those are your last words, I'll make sure to pass them on," Michael said, dragging Leo away.

"Wait!"

Everyone looked at Isabella, not understanding what she wanted to say.

Isabella glanced at Leo and said, "Let him go!"

Michael raised an eyebrow and looked at Richard. He would only obeyÂ  Richard.

Richard, however, looked at Nina. He would only obey Nina.

Nina, worried, looked at Isabella and said in a low voice, "Bella, Michael and the others are just trying to scare Leo. They won't kill anyone. Leo and Charles have already committed a crime by imprisoning you here. We'll hand him over to the police for investigation!"

Isabella shook her head. "Nina, Leo didn't imprison me. I came here willingly with him!"

Nina was stunned. "Bella, what are you talking about? How could you have come here willingly? Do you know how chaotic things are outside? Do you know they faked a car accident and used a decoy? Everyone outside thinks you're dead!"

"I know," Isabella nodded. "Nina, the person who died in the car was a servant of the Landon family, not me. I was never in any danger. I was just here recuperating."

"Bella?" Nina looked at Isabella, feeling that the Isabella in front of her seemed unfamiliar.

Isabella walked up to Leo, stopped, looked around at everyone in the yard, took a deep breath, and said, "Let me formally introduce you all. This is Leo, my fiancÃ©."

The entire place fell silent.

And Sebastian, who had just walked in from outside the yard, was dumbfounded.

###chapter 217 Don't Leave Me

"Bella." After a brief moment of shock, Nina walked over and pulled Isabella aside. "You don't need to be afraid. You're safe now. They can't threaten you anymore."

Isabella shook her head. "Nina, no one is threatening me. I'm telling the truth."

Nina was stunned.

She then realized Isabella was serious.

Isabella really intended to marry Leo!

"Sebastian," Kelsey suddenly called out.

Isabella's face stiffened. At that moment, she didn't dare turn her head in that direction.

Sebastian had arrived.

"Mr. Landon." Jack supported Sebastian and walked up to Isabella.

Sebastian reached out and touched Isabella's fingers, holding them tightly in his palm. "Bella?"

Isabella looked at Sebastian's empty eyes, feeling a sharp pain in her heart. She tried hard to endure it and said calmly, "Sebastian, I heard you're getting married. Congratulations."

"I won't marry anyone except for you." Sebastian tightened his grip on her hand and hugged her. "You're alive! That's wonderful!"

Days of longing surged like a flood. Isabella slowly raised her hand, wanting to hug the wounded Sebastian in front of her.

Isabella looked up, her gaze passing over the crowd, and saw Charles and Emma standing there.

When their eyes met, Sweetie's innocent face flashed in her mind, and she seemed to hear the fragile cries of a baby.

Isabella's hand froze in mid-air, then her fingers clenched one by one. She used her fist to push Sebastian away.

"Bella." Sebastian reached out, still wanting to hug her.

Isabella quickly stepped back, avoiding his hand.

Sebastian grabbed at the air, anxiously grasping around but completely missing her. He stumbled and fell to the ground.

"Bella, Bella." Sebastian looked around in confusion, groping on the ground.

Isabella couldn't bear to look at him any longer. She turned her gaze away and said coldly, "I'm getting married to Leo. Mr. Landon, congratulations."

Sebastian suddenly stopped. He looked up sharply in Isabella's direction. "Impossible!"

"Nothing is impossible!" Isabella linked her arm with Leo's. "Three days from now, Leo and I will have our wedding. You're all welcome to attend."

With that, she took Leo's arm and started to leave.

"Isabella!" Sebastian shouted, his voice wrought with anguish. "Don't go. Don't leave me again."

Isabella paused. She took a deep breath and suddenly let go of Leo's hand.

Leo's expression tightened, and he grabbed her wrist in return.

Isabella gave Leo a slight smile. "I need to say a proper goodbye to Sebastian, don't I?"

Leo hesitated for a moment, then let go of her hand.

Isabella turned around and walked back to Sebastian step by step.

She reached out and held Sebastian's hand.

"Bella!" Sebastian gripped her hand tightly, almost breaking her bones.

Isabella winced in pain but didn't pull away. She let him hold her and said calmly, "Mr. Landon, our child is gone."

Sebastian was stunned and he looked like he was in pain.

Isabella's heart felt like it had been slashed, but she remained calm on the surface, even a bit indifferent. "Mr. Landon, I witnessed you and Emily in bed together. Whether you made love or not, my child is gone because of you. I hated you the moment I lost the child."

After Isabella spoke, Sebastian could hardly breathe and couldn't speak.

He just stared at her with his blind eyes.

Isabella's voice continued, filled with unprecedented determination and coldness. "Do you know? I really wish it was you who had died!"

Sebastian was speechless.

"Our relationship was a mistake from the beginning, destined to end badly. Now that the child is gone, our bond is completely severed. Mr. Landon, take care of yourself."

Isabella pulled her hand back. This time, Sebastian seemed to want to hold on but didn't, because he knew he no longer had the right.

Then Isabella left with Leo.

Nina was stunned for a moment and then followed.

Richard also went after them.

In just a short moment, the courtyard that had been full of people was now almost empty.

"Mr. Landon." Jack reached out to help Sebastian.

Sebastian suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

He clutched his heart and fell to the ground, heartbroken.

As Isabella was about to get into the car, Nina caught up.

Isabella paused. "Nina."

Nina glanced at Leo and said, "Bella, no matter what you decide, I support you."

"Thank you."

"Even if you want to marry Leo, you shouldn't leave your family home. I'm your only family now. Since you haven't married yet, you have to come back with me."

Isabella was about to refuse, because she thought Leo and Charles wouldn't let her go back.

Before Isabella spoke, Leo said, "Nina is right. I didn't think it through."

Isabella looked at him in surprise.

Leo said, "You go back with Nina. I'll handle things at home. In three days, I'll come to marry you in grand style!"

Nina took Isabella's hand and brought her to her side. She was extremely wary of Leo. "Don't worry. As long as Bella is willing to marry you, I'll make sure she has a grand wedding!"

Leo smiled. "Thank you, Nina."

The ride was silent.

The car arrived at the Jose family home.

Nina took Isabella upstairs.

After closing the door, Nina locked it for extra security.

Then, Nina pushed Isabella to sit on the bed and started searching her.

Isabella asked, "Nina, what are you looking for?"

"I'm looking for a bug." Nina said, then covered her mouth, afraid of revealing too much.

Isabella held her hand. "Stop looking. I don't have any bugs on me."

Nina stopped but still looked at her in confusion. "Bella, I don't believe a single word you said tonight! Are they threatening you?"

Isabella looked at Nina and pressed her lips together. "No."

"I don't believe it!"

"Believe it or not, everything I said tonight is true!"

Nina looked at Isabella for a long time, finally seeming to accept the fact, though still a bit reluctant. "Have you really decided to marry Leo?"

"Yes."

"What about Sebastian?"

Isabella's heart ached, rendering her speechless.

###chapter 218 Choosing a Wedding Dress

"Bella." Nina held her hand, "you can fool everyone else, but you can't fool me! You still love Sebastian, and clearly..."

"Enough!" Isabella suddenly stood up and walked to the window. "Don't mention Sebastian again. I hate him. He killed my child. I will never forgive him in this lifetime!"

"Bella..."

"Nina, I'm very tired. I want to rest." Isabella raised her hand to her forehead.

She was truly exhausted.

Lying was exhausting.

Saying those hateful words hurt Sebastian, but it didn't make her feel any better either.

Nina didn't want to push Isabella any further and let her rest.

Kelsey had been eavesdropping outside the room for a while. When she heard Isabella say she would never forgive Sebastian, her heart sank.

The room fell into silence. Kelsey straightened up. As she turned her head, she nearly collided with someone.

Startled out of her wits, she focused her eyes and exclaimed, "Michael?"

Michael crossed his arms over his chest, a teasing smile on his lips. "I didn't expect you to enjoy eavesdropping on others, Ms. Jose."

A guilty look flashed across Kelsey's face. "Nonsense! I was looking for something here. When did you see me eavesdropping?"

Michael pointed to his eyes. "I just saw you."

Kelsey pouted. "You don't understand."

"What do I not understand?" Michael pressed.

He was naturally competitive and never admitted defeat. The more someone else said he didn't understand, the more he wanted to prove he did!

Kelsey looked at him and asked, "You say you understand. So tell me, what should Isabella and Sebastian do?"

Michael thought for a moment and said, "Cut ties completely, find their own happiness, and become strangers."

Kelsey jumped in frustration. "Nonsense!"

Michael's face fell. "How dare you insult me!"

Kelsey covered her mouth and stepped back.

How could she forget that Michael couldn't take a joke?

Michael stared at her with a smile. "One will remarry, and the other will find a new partner. Won't they be able to find their own happiness then? Later, one will be someone else's wife, and the other someone else's husband. Won't they become strangers then? How am I wrong?"

Kelsey lowered her hand and said, "I still don't believe this is true."

"Do you know Isabella well?" Michael asked.

Kelsey was at a loss for words and glared at Michael angrily. "Do you have to be so sharp-tongued?"

Every word of Michael's had hit the mark, leaving her unable to refute him.

Michael raised an eyebrow. "It's not that I'm sharp-tongued; it's that you're not being thorough."

Kelsey was unconvinced. "Anyway, I won't just watch this tragedy unfold."

She had to do something!

Michael looked at her. "I advise you not to get involved."

"Who are you to tell me that?" Kelsey raised her head and walked away.

Michael was speechless.

The next day.

The police came to take Isabella's statement.

The police had already asked the Landon family about the person who had died in the car and were told it was the driver's daughter.

They hadn't known she was there because she had been hiding in the trunk that night.

Afterward, the driver died.

The pregnant female corpse that was found in the car had been mistaken for Isabella because, besides the driver, no one knew about the girl's existence.

Just yesterday, the driver's wife had come forward and revealed the truth.

What was initially a setup wasÂ turned into an accident, and the Landon family was completely cleared of any involvement.

"Ms. Miller, were you held captive by Leo? Did he restrict your freedom?"

Isabella shook her head. "He didn't. I stayed in that villa voluntarily. He never restricted my freedom."

"Can you tell us why you chose to stay there? Did you know that because of your disappearance, there were rumors that you were dead?"

Isabella paused and said, "After the car accident, I had a miscarriage. I stayed in the villa to recuperate and was unaware of what was happening outside. I originally planned to reappear once I felt better physically and emotionally. I'm sorry for causing so much trouble, but this really has nothing to do with Leo. He is my fiancÃ©, and our wedding is approaching. I hope the police can find out the truth and clear Leo of any suspicion, so it won't affect our wedding."

"Alright." The officer nodded. "We will definitely get to the bottom of this, Ms. Miller. Thank you for your cooperation."

Isabella nodded. "I did what I had to do."

Isabella stood on the steps, watching the police car leave.

Another car came into view, slowly driving into the Jose family's yard.

"Bella." Leo walked over and took her hand. "The winy is strong outside. Why are you wearing so little?"

As he spoke, he took off his coat and draped it over Isabella's shoulders.

Isabella looked at him, not knowing what to say.

Leo said, "Our wedding is in two days. I came to take you to pick out your wedding dress."

Isabella looked around to make sure no one was around, then lowered her voice and said, "I want to see Sweetie."

Leo squeezed her hand. "I'll take you to her."

He led her down the steps.

"Bella." Nina hurried over, giving Leo a wary look. "Where are you going?"

"I'm taking Bella to pick out her wedding dress," Leo explained.

Nina didn't trust him and looked at Isabella for confirmation.

Nina was still uneasy even after she saw Isabella nod. "I'll go with you."

"Sure." Leo readily agreed. "You can help us pick a dress."

Nina got into the car as well.

As soon as the car left the Jose family, Michael, who was hiding in the shadows, immediately took out his phone and called Richard. "Richard, Leo has taken Nina and Isabella away."

"Follow them. I'll be there soon."

"Okay." Michael had just gotten into his car when the passenger door opened, and someone climbed in.

Michael looked at Kelsey, who quickly fastened her seatbelt, and raised an eyebrow.

Kelsey ignored his expression and pointed ahead. "Hurry up, or we'll lose them!"

Michael couldn't be bothered to argue with her and started the car.

At the bridal shop, wedding dresses were everywhere, which made the shop seem dreamy and surreal.

Isabella randomly picked two dresses and went to the fitting room.

The fitting room was large, and two attendants helped her into the heavy wedding dress. Isabella stood in front of the mirror, looking a bit dazed.

Nina stood behind her, her expression also complicated. "It's beautiful."

The attendant asked, "Do you need help matching shoes?"

Isabella turned to Nina and said, "Nina, I want you to help me pick out two pairs of shoes."

In their hometown, there was a tradition that the bride's wedding shoes had to be chosen by the person closest to her.

When Nina and Charlie had gotten married, Isabella had picked out the shoes.

Now it was Isabella's turn, and Nina had to help her choose.

"Alright." Nina nodded. "I'll go take a look. Wait here for me."

"Okay."

After Nina left, Isabella sent the two attendants away.

She lifted the heavy skirt and went next door to find Leo.

But when she pushed the door open, she saw Sebastian.

###chapter 219 No More

Isabella was stunned.

She thought she was seeing things, but after rubbing her eyes hard, Sebastian was still sitting there.

Sebastian was dressed in a black suit with a black bow tie and was sitting quietly as if waiting for someone.

It is said that when one lost their sight, their hearing became sharper. When Isabella pushed the door open, he heard the sound and turned his head, asking emotionlessly, "Are you ready?"

Isabella was speechless.

Sebastian slowly stood up, holding a black cane.

He groped his way forward until the cane touched the hem of Isabella's wedding dress, then stopped.

Sebastian retracted the cane slightly, his expression indifferent. "Since I can't see anyway, it doesn't matter how beautiful you look. Once you've chosen a dress, go and report back."

Isabella knew that Sebastian had mistaken her for someone else.

At this moment, the two stood face to face.

She could see Sebastian, but Sebastian couldn't see her.

Their reflections were visible in the full-length mirror beside them.

As Isabella gazed at the reflections of Sebastian and herself in the mirror, her thoughts turned to her daughter, Sweetie, and a pang of sorrow filled her heart.

She didn't speak, reaching out to grab Sebastian's hand.

Sebastian's fingers stiffened, and he quickly pulled his hand back, angrily saying, "What are you doing?"

Isabella didn't speak and stubbornly reached out again, grabbing Sebastian's hand and placing it on her wedding dress.

Sebastian couldn't see, so she wanted him to feel it.

This was her first time wearing a wedding dress, and Isabella really wanted Sebastian to see it.

She only wanted to wear it for Sebastian.

Sebastian's fingers slid over the wedding dress, and for a moment, he seemed to see Isabella standing in front of him in the dress.

His heart stirred, and he reached out to grab Isabella.

Isabella took a step back, and at the same time, another white figure brushed past her and was caught by Sebastian.

Isabella looked at Emily, who had suddenly appeared, with astonishment, deeply suspecting that everything had been meticulously orchestrated by her.

"Bella?" Sebastian hugged Emily, his trembling fingers reaching for her face.

Emily didn't respond, holding Sebastian's face in her hands and kissing him in front of Isabella.

Sebastian was shocked.

Isabella was also stunned.

Their kiss was reflected in the full-length mirror and in Isabella's eyes. A chill ran down her spine.

Just as Isabella was about to rush over and pull Emily away, Leo appeared.

"Bella, what are you doing here? I've been looking for you." Leo's voice stopped abruptly when he saw Sebastian and Emily, his expression becoming complicated.

"Bella?" Sebastian pushed Emily away and stumbled toward Isabella.

Unable to see, Sebastian heavily knocked over a nearby flower stand. With a crash, the stand and the flower pots fell on Sebastian.

Isabella was alarmed and wanted to help Sebastian, but Leo grasped her wrist firmly.

Then she turned back, and Leo silently shook his head at Isabella.

At that moment, Emily had already helped Sebastian up, asking with concern, "Sebastian, are you okay?"

Sebastian completely ignored Emily, not caring about the dirt on him, and continued to reach forward.

He finally touched a pair of soft hands, gripping them tightly. "Bella, Bella."

Although he couldn't see, Sebastian touched the texture of the wedding dress, and he smiled. "You're wearing a wedding dress? You must look beautiful."

Isabella felt a pang in her heart and stood still stiffly. She couldn't bear to push him away but didn't know what to do.

At this moment, the dressing room door opened, and Charles and Emma walked in.

"Godfather, godmother." Leo's voice brought Isabella back to reality.

She was surprised at what Leo had called them.

Seeing Isabella's puzzled look, Leo explained, "I forgot to tell you, Charles and Aunt Emma have agreed to make me their godson. Bella, at our wedding, godfather and godmother will be the witnesses. Are you happy?"

Even though the wedding was approaching, Isabella couldn't feel any joy.

Emma walked over, looking Isabella up and down. "You look beautiful in a wedding dress."

She then looked at Emily, generously praising her. "You look beautiful too, Emily. No wonder people say a girl looks most beautiful moment on her wedding day.I'm genuinely happy for you two now that I've seen you."

"Thank you, Emma." Emily sweetly replied, never missing a chance to please Emma.

After all, once she married Sebastian, Emma would be her mother-in-law.

It would benefit Emily to have a good relationship with Emma.

Isabella stood there, still not speaking.

Sebastian was still holding her hand , and Isabella felt some pain, perhaps because he was holding it too tightly.

Leo glanced at Isabella and said with a smile, "After we get married, we'll be a family."

As he spoke, Leo secretly pinched Isabella's arm.

Isabella knew Leo was reminding her to keep her distance from Sebastian. She took a deep breath, suppressing her discomfort, and tried to pull her hand back.

But Sebastian held on tightly, and she couldn't pull away.

Isabella had to speak. "Sebastian, Emily is here, it's not appropriate for you to hold me like this."

Sebastian stood there in a daze.

"Are you really going to marry him?" Sebastian asked.

His expression was so hurt that Isabella couldn't bear to look at him. She lowered her eyes and replied softly, "Yes."

Sebastian pulled her hard, causing Isabella to take a few steps forward, almost bumping into him.

IsabellaÂ looked up, meeting Sebastian's empty eyes, feeling a sharp pain in her heart, unable to speak.

"What about me?" Sebastian stared at her, gritting his teeth."Isabella, are you really going to leave me?"

Isabella nodded her head and replied. "Yes, I am."

Sebastian's grip on her fingers tightened abruptly as his another hand clasped the back of her head, drawing her into a sudden kiss.

Sebastian's kiss was passionate and urgent, filled with a fierce intensity but also a hidden tenderness.

Isabella's heart ached and felt like it was being twisted. She was forced to tilt her head, accepting Sebastian's kiss, and her hands clutched his lapels. She hung on him like a fragile doll hanging on him.

Kelsey and Michael walked in, witnessing the scene.

Nina finished selecting her shoes and joined them coincidentally. She was stunned by the scene.

Emily clenched the hem of her wedding dress, unsure of what expression to make.

Leo, coming to his senses, stepped forward to separate Isabella and Sebastian.

Leo pushed Isabella aside and raised his fist, aiming it at Sebastian's face.

"No!" Isabella gasped in alarm, watching helplessly as Leo's fist descended, her breath catching painfully.

###chapter 220 A Bold Guess

At the critical moment, Michael dashed over and counterattacked Leo.

Michael's punch was not light; it made Leo stagger sideways a few steps before barely regaining his balance. However, blood was already trickling from the corner of Leo's mouth, and a red mark was left on his cheek.

Leo spat out a mouthful of blood and walked over to take Isabella's hand. "Let's go!"

"Bella!" Sebastian reached out to seize her, but his hand closed around emptiness.

Michael raised his hand to support Sebastian and whispered, "Mr. Landon, I think Miss Lopez is just fine."

With that, Michael handed Sebastian over to Emily and turned back to Kelsey.

Kelsey stared blankly at Michael, her mind filled with the image of him dashing over to punch Leo.

She wasn't one for girlish fantasies, but she had to admit that Michael looked incredibly cool at that moment.

"Are you still watching?" Michael paused and met her gaze. "Not leaving yet?"

Kelsey guiltily averted her eyes and followed him.

"Sebastian," Charles took a step forward and said in a deep voice. "Emma has picked a few good dates. You should choose one to marry Emily."

"No need to choose." Sebastian straightened up, his face returning to its cold demeanor. He turned around and said, "In two days."

"Two days later?" Emily looked at him in surprise. "But in two days, it's Isabella and Leo's big day."

"Precisely because it's a good day, we'll set it for two days later," Sebastian replied, facing Charles. "Didn't you just take Leo as your godson? Since we're all family, it'll be more convenient to have the weddings together."

Charles pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement. "Alright."

Isabella picked out a wedding dress without much enthusiasm. Leo then suggested they go ring shopping.

Inside the jewelry store, the clerk presented a selection of diamond rings and various luxurious jewelry pieces.

Isabella's mind was entirely on Sweetie, and she had no interest in choosing these. She pointed to a couple of items to get it over with and then asked Leo, "When will you take me to see Sweetie?"

Leo glanced at her. "No rush."

"I'm in a rush!" Isabella stood up. "Take me to see her. As long as I see she's safe, I'll be at ease."

Leo put down the ring, grabbed her hand, and walked out. "Follow me."

In the mall's nursing room, Leo let go of her hand. "I'll wait outside."

Isabella was stunned. "Sweetie is inside?"

"Yes."

Isabella didn't hesitate and pushed open the door.

As soon as she walked in, she saw Samantha holding Sweetie in her arms.

Isabella immediately scooped up Sweetie, and the moment she held her, her heart, which had felt so empty, was completely filled. It was as if she had the whole world in her arms.

Children changed so quickly. It had only been a few days, but Isabella felt Sweetie had grown a lot. Sweetie, likely well-fed, was awake with her eyes wide open, quietly leaning against Isabella.

Isabella held Sweetie tightly, her gaze fixed on the little one's face, reluctant to look away for even a second.

She wished time could freeze at this very moment and never move forward.

Ten minutes passed quickly. Leo knocked on the door, and Samantha was about to take Sweetie away.

"Wait," Isabella said.

She held Sweetie tightly, lowered her head, and placed a gentle kiss on Sweetie's brow.

Then she handed Sweetie to Samantha. "Samantha, please! You must take good care of her."

Samantha nodded.

At that moment, there was a commotion outside.

When Isabella opened the door, she saw Michael and a few others pushing Leo aside and rushing into the nursing room.

Isabella was shocked and immediately followed.

She was afraid Michael and his men might be rough and hurt Sweetie.

But when the door to the nursing room was pushed open, it was empty.

She stood frozen, confused. Just a minute ago, she and Samantha had been there. She hadn't seen Samantha leave, and now, the room was completely vacant. How could someone-especially a baby-just disappear?

She was still puzzled when she saw Michael walk in, look around, and then open a cabinet against the wall.

Inside the cabinet, there was a hole!

Michael shot up from his seat. "Quick! Block the exits next door!"

But it was too late.

By the time Michael and the others burst into the maternity room, Samantha had already whisked Sweetie away, darting out of the adjoining room.

"Seal off the mall immediately!" Michael ordered his men.

Isabella, however, said, "No!"

Michael looked at her in confusion.

Isabella's face was pale, and she said in a trembling voice, "Michael, the person you're looking for isn't here!"

Michael understood that she no longer wished to search.

After all the time they had wasted, it was highly likely that Sweetie had already slipped out of the mall.

Continuing this chase would not only be fruitless but could also provoke Charles' wrath.

With Sweetie in Charles's hands, Isabella was terrified of what might happen next.

Michael pressed his lips together and asked, "Are you sure?"

Isabella nodded. She walked over and took Leo's arm, her voice hoarse. "Let's go."

When Sebastian got home, he took a bowl of soup from Emily, drank it, and then lay down.

"I'm tired. I want to sleep for a while. You can go." Sebastian said.

Emily looked at him. "Sebastian, are we really getting married in two days?"

Sebastian closed his eyes and said without much emotion, "Isn't this what you've always wanted?"

Emily didn't say anything.

It was true; this was what she had longed for. But Sebastian had been resistant until now, and suddenly agreeing-especially with the added twist of a joint wedding with Isabella-left her feeling uneasy. She feared something might go awry.

Noticing her silence, Sebastian added, "If you're having second thoughts, I can always find someone else."

"No!" Emily said, "I want to! I really want to. Sebastian, I know you can't let go of Isabella, but I can't let go of you either. As long as you need me, I'll always be by your side."

Sebastian said tiredly, "Go out."

"Okay." Emily tucked him in before leaving.

Outside, Emily's footsteps faded away, and a gust of wind blew through the window, bringing in a strange scent.

Sebastian opened his eyes and sat up straight. "Jack."

Jack stepped out from the shadows. "Mr. Landon."

"How did it go?" Sebastian asked as he got up.

Jack hesitated for a moment and then recounted everything he had seen and heard while following Michael to the mall.

Sebastian's expression grew serious. "You mean they were blocking someone in the nursing room?"

"Yes." Jack looked at him. "Mr. Landon, I have a bold guess. Could it be..."

"Yes!" Sebastian interrupted, excitement lighting up his face. "You must be onto something. The baby is alive! She's still out there, under Charles's control! That's why Bella is going along with everything, marrying Leo, saying those things to me!

"Bella had no choice. She didn't mean it. She's indeed protecting our child!

"I knew it. I knew it!" Sebastian was overjoyed.

Jack was speechless.

In this world, only Isabella could make Sebastian lose his mind in an instant.

And only Isabella could make Sebastian regain his sanity just as quickly!

###chapter 221 Listening to You

Jack said, "After they left, I immediately checked the surveillance footage outside the nursing room. As expected, it was tampered with. I've already arranged for a covert citywide search."

"No!" Sebastian raised his hand. "No searches!"

He analyzed, "Charles won't harm the child because he needs the child to control Isabella and torment me. He wants to turn me into a lapdog. Bella and the child are his best cards. If we search now, it will only alert Charles, and Bella and the child might get hurt."

Jack nodded. "You're right, but what should we do next? The wedding is in two days. Are you really going to let Isabella marry Leo?"

"The wedding?" Sebastian sneered. "The wedding will go on, but who marries whom is up to me."

"Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian pondered for a moment before quietly instructing Jack.

Nina had been waiting in the bridal shop for a while when Richard arrived.

"Everyone's gone?" Seeing her alone, Richard asked.

"Yeah." Nina stood up. "Michael said you'd be coming over to talk to me about something, so I've been waiting here for you. What is it?"

Richard said, "Can you help me pick out a suit?"

"For what?"

"For Isabella's wedding in two days. I don't have anything decent to wear, and I trust your taste." Richard naturally took Nina's hand and led her to the suit section.

The shop was filled with staff, and their hand-holding drew quite a bit of attention. Nina tried to pull her hand away a few times, but Richard held on firmly.

Seeing she couldn't pull away, Nina temporarily gave up.

In the suit section, she carefully selected two suits.

"These two look pretty good." Nina said.

Richard glanced at them casually. "Let me try them on."

His gaze was so piercing and intense that it caused Nina to blush.

"Go ahead and try them on." She took the opportunity to pull her hand back and handed him the suits.

Richard smiled. "Wait here for me."

Then he went into the fitting room.

Nina wandered around for a bit, and soon Richard came out in the suit.

As soon as he appeared, several female clerks gasped in admiration.

"So handsome."

Richard ignored the women with girlish fantasies. His eyes scanned the store, and upon spotting Nina, he walked straight to her.

"How do I look?" he asked.

Nina was speechless.

It was clear from the staff's reaction that the suit looked good. Even though she tried not to be swayed like the other women, Nina couldn't deny that Richard looked striking.

Richard's appearance was far from the refined, gentlemanly look of Sebastian or Zaire. His rough edges and commanding presence hinted at his tough experiences in life, making him seem imposing even when he was being gentle.

Nina had never paid much attention to what Richard usually wore; she only knew he was always dressed in black. As for the fabric or material, she couldn't say.

Richard stood there in a sharply tailored dark suit paired with a sleek black shirt, with no tie in sight. His relaxed demeanor contrasted starkly with the bright overhead lights, which cast a cool glow on his rugged features, emphasizing a subtly aloof charm. Yet, the warmth in his gaze was unmistakable as it fixed on Nina.

"You look good." Nina glanced at him and then looked away.

Richard smiled. "Should I take both?"

Nina thought the suits in the store were expensive, each costing around ten thousand dollars. She knew Richard wasn't short on money, but she still felt it was unnecessary.

"One suit is enough for the wedding. I don't see you wearing suits often, so buying two would be a waste." Nina suggested.

Richard paused and said, "You have a point. I'll listen to you."His serious tone sent ripples of warmth through her.

"To sweeten the deal, I picked out two dresses for you. Want to give them a whirl?" He gestured, and a shop assistant wheeled over a rack showcasing two elegant gowns.

For Isabella's wedding, Nina had planned to dress up anyway. Seeing Richard's enthusiasm, she obediently tried on the dresses.

Richard had good taste; both dresses suited her well.

Most importantly, they were styles Nina liked.

"I'll take them off and pay for them," Nina said.

"Okay." Richard nodded in agreement.

However, when she came out after changing, Richard was already at the cashier signing the receipt.

"I said I'd pay," Nina whispered.

Richard signed his name on the receipt and turned to her with a smile. "What's mine is yours.

"If you feel bad, just treat me to a meal," Richard suggested, seizing the moment.

Nina said, "I still need to buy something for Bella."

"I'll help you with that first, and then you can treat me to dinner." Richard said.Â 

Richard had it all planned out, leaving Nina with no reason to refuse.

Leo took Isabella back to the Jose family's residence.

"I'm leaving now." Isabella reached for the car door.

"Wait." Leo grabbed her wrist.

Isabella turned back. "What is it?"

Leo flashed a playful smile and pointed to his cheek. "How about a kiss before you go?"

Isabella thought he was joking.

But Leo's expression was serious as he met her gaze. "Isabella, we're about to get married. Soon, you'll be my legal wife. Besides, I took a hit today for you. Just think of this as a little comfort-one kiss?"

Isabella stared at him for a while. "I'm sorry. I..."

"It's okay." Leo interrupted her with a smile, "Everything takes time. I know you still can't let go of Sebastian. It's okay, we have plenty of time. I believe one day, I'll win you over."

Isabella listened to his words without any emotional response.

She knew Leo wasn't exactly a saint.

Throughout all of this, he had played both the hero and the villain.

Sure, he might have grievances against Charles, but he was deeply involved in the mess, and he stood to gain from it.

In the past few days, news about the Anderson group's turmoil had been nonstop. With Charles' help, Kevin had made several irreparable mistakes and had been ousted from the Anderson group. Meanwhile, Leo had gained control of half of the Anderson group's power.

Leo must have done a lot to achieve this.

She would never fall for Leo.

Her temporary compliance was only to protect Sweetie and Sebastian.

Leo stared at her for a while before letting go. "Go on."

Isabella nodded and got out of the car.

Watching Isabella enter the house, Leo let out a bitter laugh.

Just as he was about to drive away, his phone buzzed with a message.

He glanced at it, his expression hardening slightly, and replied: [I'll be there right away.]

###chapter 222 Gone

Inside the somewhat shabby rental apartment, everything had been turned upside down.

Samantha sat amidst the chaos, her expression somewhat bewildered, with traces of tears still visible on her face. Leo came in. "Where's the child?"

Samantha picked up a writing board from the floor and wrote on it. "Sent away."

Leo grabbed her wrist, his face fierce. "Where to?"

Samantha shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes.

Since Sweetie was born, she had been the one caring for the child. The bond they had formed over day and night had made Sweetie deeply precious to her. The sudden disappearance of the child was tearing her apart.

Leo let go of her and dialed Charles' number.

He immediately questioned, "Mr. Landon, where did you take the child?"

Charles replied emotionlessly, "That's not for you to ask."

"Bring the child back!" Leo gritted his teeth. "You promised not to touch the child!"

"Leo, do you think I can't see through you? If I let Samantha keep the child, were you planning to secretly send them away?"

Leo was stunned.

He had indeed considered this plan, but he had never mentioned it to anyone and thought he had kept it hidden. Charles had seen right through him.

Charles sneered. "Do you think I don't know your game? I thought you were playing for the Anderson group, but it turns out you've got real feelings for Isabella. Leo, if you want to succeed, you need to let go of your emotions. Your feelings for Isabella will only hold you back. If I don't exploit your weakness, and you end up having a change of heart and return the child, helping her and Sebastian, everything I've done will be for nothing."

"The child is innocent!"A sudden wave of helplessness surged within Leo's heart.

"Don't worry. As long as you and Isabella's matter is settled, the two-year period won't change." Charles said.

Leo gritted his teeth. "Fine!"

He hung up the phone, and Samantha came over, using the writing board to ask: [Are you really going to marry Isabella?]

Leo glanced at it and said indifferently, "Yes."

He was about to leave when Samantha grabbed him, hugging him tightly from behind.

Leo paused.

He understood that Samantha was trying to keep him.

He hesitated, then pried her hands off."Samantha, I'll give you some money. You should leave."

Samantha looked confused, shaking her head as she clutched his hand.

"Lakina is in turmoil now, and I'm already involved and can't get out. But you can still leave. If you can go, just go. Leave Lakina, go far away, and never come back." Leo said.

Samantha cried and shook her head, holding onto him with both hands, refusing to let go.

Leo looked at her, forcefully pried her hands off, and left a bank card. "This card contains three hundred thousand dollars, enough for you to settle in a city."

After saying that, Leo left quickly.

By the time Samantha chased after him, he had already driven away.

Late that night, the Landon family phone rang suddenly, waking Charles and Emma from their sleep.

Charles reached for his glasses with one hand and grabbed the phone with the other. Seeing the caller ID, he pressed to answer.

The voice on the other end was urgent. "Mr. Landon, the child is missing!"

"What did you say!" Charles was instantly wide awake. He stood up abruptly, pacing back and forth by the bed. "Explain clearly! Didn't I tell you to keep a close watch?"

"Everything was going fine. We took the child on a cruise, and several of us took turns watching over her. But suddenly, the cruise hit some rough seas, and the stroller tipped over. By the time we managed to right the stroller, it was empty."

Charles gritted his teeth. "Then hurry and investigate!"

"Yes." The other end responded urgently.

Charles hung up, his face a mask of worry as he started pacing by the edge of the bed, hands clasped behind his back, clearly rattled.

Emma asked, "What's wrong?"

Charles stopped, looking straight at her. "The child is missing!"

"What?" Emma was also shocked. "How could that happen? Have they searched everywhere?"

"They're already on it," Charles replied, glancing at the clock on the bedside table. "The decision to send the child away was sudden. Besides you and me, only a handful of trusted confidants knew-Leo and Samantha were caught off guard too. Who could have leaked this?"

Emma remained silent.

Charles pondered for a moment but couldn't figure it out. Seeing Emma standing there quietly, he felt a bit sorry and patted her shoulder. "It's chilly out. You shouldn't just stand there."

Emma flinched at his touch, taken aback.

Charles paused."What's wrong?"

"Nothing." Emma shook her head, but her face was unnatural. "I'm just worried about the child. Do you think it could be someone Sebastian arranged?"

Charles frowned.

That was indeed possible!

He had just received the call and immediately thought of Sebastian.

If Sweetie had been taken by Sebastian, their entire plan could go up in flames.

After all, Sweetie was their only leverage, both to control Isabella and to make Sebastian obedient.

"Arrange a lunch tomorrow, I'll test him face-to-face. Then we will find out."

Emma nodded. "Okay, I'll arrange it."

Charles thought, 'If Sweetie were in Sebastian's hands, with Sebastian's temper, he definitely wouldn't be manipulated anymore.'

As he dialed the number, unease gnawed at him.

Finally, Emily called back, saying Sebastian had agreed to come over for lunch.

But halfway through his relief, he tensed up again.

Even with the lunch set, he still couldn't confirm whether Sweetie was in Sebastian's possession.

Overthinking wasn't going to help; he needed to confront Sebastian directly to get the answers he sought.

When Emily and Sebastian set off, Leo also went to the Jose family's residence to pick up Isabella.

The two cars arrived almost simultaneously, and they met in the yard.

Emily supported Sebastian, smiling and greeting them. "Leo, Isabella, you're here too."

Leo nodded, politely calling, "Emily."

Emily responded warmly, her gaze slowly turning to Isabella.

It seemed she was waiting for Isabella to call her.

Isabella's gaze calmly swept over Emily's face, then moved away indifferently.

She made no move to speak.

Emily felt slightly awkward, but her smile remained unchanged. "Let's go in. Charles and Emma must be waiting."

Since they had arrived first, and Sebastian had vision issues, Isabella and Leo were trailing behind them.

As they ascended the steps, Sebastian suddenly pushed Emily's hand away.

His white cane wobbled, and Sebastian lost his balance, his knee slamming hard against the edge of the step.

###chapter 223  Injured

"Sebastian!" Emily exclaimed in shock.

Isabella's heart skipped a beat. In that instant, she watched Sebastian fall.

Instinctively, Isabella reached out her hands, trying to catch him.

But they were a few steps apart, and before Isabella could reach out, Sebastian had already hit the ground.

Sebastian staggered, supporting himself with his hands on the ground, unable to stand up for a long time.

That fall must have been pretty hard.

"Sebastian, Sebastian, are you okay?" Emily's voice choked with emotion, and tears welled up in her eyes.

Charles and Emma came out upon hearing the commotion. Several people helped Sebastian into the house and called for a doctor.

Isabella stood there, feeling numb all over.

It wasn't until Leo held her hand and gently asked, "Are you okay?" that Isabella regained some awareness. She shook her head and let him lead her inside.

Sebastian sat on the sofa with his trouser leg rolled up, revealing a knee that was horribly bruised and bleeding, with the blood trickling down his legs and soaking into his black socks. Despite this, he sat upright, one hand resting on his knee, while Emily, beside him, looked tearful. Sebastian, however, was expressionless, as if nothing had happened.

"The doctor's here!"

A servant led the doctor in, who turned out to be Sebastian's private physician, Marvin.

Jack followed behind and explained, "We happened to be nearby and heard from the Landon family's servant that Mr. Landon had fallen, so we came to check. Marvin is Mr. Landon's private doctor; he'll take good care of him."

Charles gave Jack a meaningful look, not believing the excuse.

Jack, being Sebastian's trusted confidant, likely felt uneasy about today's meal and had specifically brought Marvin along with him.

There were few coincidences in this world, and most were intentional.

However, Charles didn't expose Jack or stop Marvin.

Charles just watched coldly from the side. When his gaze swept over Sebastian's injured knee, his brow furrowed slightly.

Emma caught this subtle expression.

Her face darkened, and she silently looked away.

Marvin examined Sebastian and said, "The injury is quite severe. I need to check if there's any bone damage. So it is best to move Mr. Landon to a room."

Charles pointed to a servant and said, "Take them to the guest room."

"Yes, sir."

Marvin and Jack helped Sebastian up from the sofa.

Emily wanted to help but was stopped by Jack. "Miss Lopez, please go back and get a clean set of clothes for Mr. Landon."

The blood from Sebastian's injury had already stained his trousers. Even though the suit was dark, the faint but unmistakable scent of blood lingered. For someone like Sebastian, who was obsessed with cleanliness, wearing these blood-soaked pants was almost unbearable-like a form of torment far worse than physical pain.

"Okay, I'll go get them now. Jack, Dr. Finn, please take good care of Sebastian."

Jack and Marvin supported Sebastian as they went upstairs.

Isabella stood there, but her heart was with them.

"Bella?" Leo squeezed her fingers.

Isabella snapped back to reality but was clearly distracted.

Emma walked over, took Isabella's hand, and said, "Bella, why don't you come to the kitchen with me to check on the food?"

"Okay." Isabella pulled her hand out of Leo's grasp.

Leo felt an emptiness in his palm, accompanied by a void in his heart.

He was about to follow when Charles said, "Leo, come with me."

With that, Charles headed upstairs.

Leo paused for a moment, watching Isabella's figure disappear at the kitchen doorway before he turned to follow Charles.

"Bella, how are things with Leo?" Emma asked tentatively.

"Pretty good." Isabella knew Emma wasn't sincerely asking, so she answered perfunctorily.

After all that had happened, any remaining illusions Isabella had about Emma were completely shattered.

Isabella had never understood how someone as gentle as Matthew could be capable of such cruel acts toward Samantha. Now, she finally saw the truth.

The so-called warm family atmosphere of the Landon family was just a facade.

When children were born, their personalities were most heavily influenced by their parents. Isabella began to suspect that the Landon family's outward warmth masked deeper, hidden darkness and secrets. This might explain why Matthew, who appeared so gentle and sunny, harbored such a sinister and malevolent nature inside.

Considering the way Charles and Emma had imprisoned her, taken Sweetie away, and used it as leverage to force her into marrying Leo, all to torment Sebastian, it was clear that this couple was anything but benevolent.

"Bella, don't blame Charles and me." Emma sighed.

Isabella pressed her lips together and said nothing.

She thought, 'Not blame them?

'How can I not?

'The harm they caused me and Sebastian is irreparable.

'And Sweetie is so innocent.'

Sweetie was taken away at birth, separated by miles.

Thinking of Sweetie made Isabella's heart ache unbearably.

Emma reached out and held Isabella's hand. "Bella."

Emma's grip was tight, her fingers wrapping around Isabella's. It was unclear whether she was offering comfort to Isabella or seeking solace for herself.

The touch of Emma's hand sent a shiver down Isabella's spine.

She stiffened, pulled her hand away, and took two steps back. "Emma, I need to use the restroom."

Emma nodded. "Go ahead."

Isabella left the kitchen.

She had been to the Landon family house a few times and knew where the first-floor restroom was.

After hesitation, she went upstairs instead.

As if guided by an unseen force, she found herself at the guest room door.

There was no sound from inside, as if no one was there.

Isabella hesitated, then turned the doorknob and pushed the door open slightly.

The room was dark, with the curtains drawn tightly, but it was empty.

She thought, 'Not here?'

Isabella's heart tightened. Without thinking, she pushed the door open.

As soon as she stepped inside, a hand reached out from behind the door, grabbing her arm and pulling her in.

Isabella opened her mouth to scream, but another hand covered it, muffling her cries.

She panicked, but in the next moment, she smelled a familiar, cool scent.

It was Sebastian!

Isabella froze and stopped struggling.

The door closed, and the hand over her mouth was removed, as was the one holding her arm.

Sebastian reached out and hugged her.

Isabella said nothing.

Perhaps it was because the past days had been too harrowing, or maybe it had been too long since Sebastian had held her like this. The sense of security she felt now was something she had longed for a long time.

Isabella hesitated for a long time before slowly raising her hands to hug Sebastian's waist.

###chapter 224  Bundle of Joy

"Bella." Sebastian's voice sounded in her ear.

Isabella woke up as if from a dream, suddenly opened her eyes, and pushed him away.

Sebastian staggered a few steps, perhaps because of his injured knee, he lost his balance and fell to the ground with a thud.

Two figures emerged from the shadows: Marvin and Jack.

It turned out that the two had been hiding in the dark corner all along, but Isabella hadn't noticed!

Marvin and Jack reached out to help Sebastian, one on each side.

"Mr. Landon!"

Marvin glanced at Isabella and clicked his tongue. "Ms. Miller, you really are heartless."

Isabella's heart tightened, and her throat felt blocked, unable to speak.

"Marvin!" Sebastian's voice cut through the room, dark and commanding. "Don't you dare talk about her like that!"

Marvin was speechless but had to comply with Sebastian. "Alright, alright, I won't say it, okay? Mr. Landon, at least get up from the ground first."

Even with Marvin and Jack's help, they couldn't pull Sebastian up.

Sebastian still sat on the ground, exposing his injured knee, facing Isabella.

He refused Marvin and Jack's assistance, reaching out to Isabella with longing eyes. "Bella."

Isabella wanted to go over, but she didn't dare.

This was the Landon family.

No one knew if there were cameras in the room that would record all their actions.

Isabella hesitated for a few seconds, then turned to open the door and leave.

"Bella, don't leave me!" Sebastian suddenly stood up from the ground, rushed over, and hugged Isabella from behind.

Isabella's hand was on the doorknob, but she felt as if all her strength had been drained in an instant. She stood there, paralyzed, unable to turn the handle.

Sebastian held her tightly, his arms like steel bands around her. He buried his head in her neck, his voice fragile. "Don't leave me, please."

Isabella felt a sudden wetness on her neck, causing her entire body to shudder.

Sebastian was actually crying!

Isabella froze completely, losing the last bit of her rationality.

Jack and Marvin exchanged a glance and discreetly departed.

Sebastian held Isabella's shoulders, turned her around, and pressed her against the door.

With a click, the door was locked.

Isabella looked at the handsome face so close to hers and finally whispered, "Sebastian, are you crazy?"

Hearing Isabella's words, Sebastian wasn't angry; instead, he smiled with relief.

He couldn't see, so he could only touch Isabella's cheek with his hand.

Fortunately, Isabella's appearance was already etched in his heart, so even though he couldn't see now, he still remembered her face.

"Bella, is our child a boy or a girl?"

Isabella's eyes widened in shock. "How did you know?"

Sebastian's hand brushed past Isabella's ear. "I'm just blind, not stupid."

Sebastian held Isabella's fingers, intertwining them with his. "Bella, is it a boy or a girl?"

The mention of Sweetie made Isabella's eyes well up. Especially with Sebastian asking, she felt an extra pang of guilt.

As a mother, she had lost Sweetie right after birth!

She thought there couldn't be a worse mother than her in this world!

Isabella sniffed, her eyelashes trembling. "It's a girl."

As soon as the words left her lips, tears began to fall.

Sebastian bent slightly, his forehead against Isabella's, gently wiping her tears with his thumb, softly comforting her, "Don't cry, Bella. Don't cry."

He smiled through his tears, "A daughter is wonderful. She'll be my little bundle of joy."

Isabella's tears continued to fall, her voice trembling as she said, "Even though she's not biologically yours, you're still this happy?"

"Who said she's not my biological child?" Sebastian pressed against her. "Nina told me, the person at the campsite that night was you!"

Isabella was stunned. "Nina told you?"

"Yes." Sebastian's voice trembled with excitement and joy. "Bella, do you know how happy I am? I'm so stupid! The clues were always there, but I never suspected you. Instead, I believed Vanessa's words and was deceived by her until now!"

"I'm so damn stupid!" Sebastian said.

Isabella raised her hand to cover his mouth, not wanting to hear Sebastian curse himself.

Sebastian held her hand and kissed it lightly. "Don't worry. I will find our daughter."

Somehow, his words brought a measure of calm to Isabella's racing heart.

She wiped away her tears and said, "I've already named our daughter. Her full name is Stella Landon and her nickname is Sweetie."

"Nice name!" At this moment, Sebastian was like a child, blindly admiring Isabella. No matter what she said, he would agree and praise her.

"Sebastian, to protect the child, I have to marry Leo." Isabella regained her rationality, thinking this was a good opportunity to explain everything to Sebastian.

As soon as she finished speaking, Sebastian leaned in and kissed her hard.

Isabella tried to push him away, but he pressed harder, leaving her no room to resist.

It wasn't until she was almost suffocating that Sebastian let her go, gasping. "Bella, you can only marry me in this lifetime!"

"Sebastian!" Isabella's eyes widened. "I just want to protect the child, I believe you feel the same way as I do!"

"I'm not like you!" Sebastian kissed her again, this time gently. "Only children make choices; I want both you and the child!"

"But..."Isabella wanted to say something more, but suddenly footsteps sounded outside the door.

Then, Leo's voice came.

"Have you seen Isabella?"

Hearing this voice, Isabella almost froze.

She clutched Sebastian's clothes tightly, whispering, "Leo is here!"

Sebastian remained calm, listening intently.

In the hallway, a Landon family servant informed Leo, "It seems Ms. Miller went into the guest room."

"Really?" Leo glanced at the closed door. "Got it. Thanks."

With that, he walked over.

Finally, Leo stopped at the door.

Just a thin wall separated Isabella's racing heart from discovery. Her face was a mask of terror, and she was tensed to the point of rigidity.

Feeling her unease, Sebastian gently stroked her back. " Don't be afraid."

Isabella's eyes widened.

If they were discovered, she, Sebastian, and Sweetie would all be doomed!

She thought, 'Now that Leo is standing at the door, how can I not be afraid?'

Seeing Isabella unable to relax, Sebastian sighed softly. He pinched her chin and kissed her again.

Isabella's whole body was tense to the extreme.

Sebastian, however, was unaffected, deepening the kiss.

Suddenly, there was a sharp knock on the door. Isabella pressed her back against the door panel, feeling the vibrations as if they were an extension of her own trembling.

###chapter 225 Split in Half

The knocking on the door continued.

Isabella, pressed against the door by Sebastian, felt her strength ebbing away. Her mind screamed to push him off, but her limbs refused to cooperate.

Sebastian's hand had somehow slipped under her clothes, his fingertips lightly brushing Isabella's skin, making her shiver uncontrollably.

Isabella felt herself melting into him, her body more sensitive than it had been before giving birth. She could only rely on Sebastian for support.

Just when Isabella thought Sebastian wouldn't let her go, the weight pressing on her suddenly disappeared.

Isabella opened her eyes in surprise, thinking it was over.

But as soon as she saw Sebastian's face clearly, he kissed her again.

This time, it was even more intense than before.

Isabella struggled to keep up, her breaths coming in broken gasps.

The knocking on the door outside had stopped at some point.

Leo stood quietly at the door, his hand still raised in mid-air, maintaining the knocking posture. When he heard the sounds coming from behind the door, his hand froze in mid-air, unable to drop.

Charles's voice came from behind. "Leo, why are you standing here?"

Leo paused, naturally retracting his hand. "I was going to check on Sebastian."

Charles raised an eyebrow, glancing at the closed door. "Want to go in together?"

"Better not." Leo shook his head."I don't want to get beaten up."

"Go find Isabella. I'm afraid she'll get bored being alone." Charles said.

"Okay." Leo nodded and turned to leave.

Once Leo was out of sight, Charles walked over and turned the doorknob.

Surprisingly, the door wasn't locked and opened easily.

Charles walked in, Sebastian was lying on the bed, and Jack was standing by the bed, watching Marvin examine Sebastian's leg injury.

"Mr. Landon," Jack turned his head and greeted.

Charles glanced around the room, his gaze pausing for a few seconds on the floor-to-ceiling curtains by the balcony, then casually moved away, asking Jack, "How is it?"

Marvin stood up and replied, "Luckily, no bones are broken. But Mr. Landon's injury is still serious. He needs to be taken care of carefully. No walking for at least half a month to avoid aggravating the injury."

Charles nodded. "Emily will take good care of him."

Surface wounds were easy to handle. Marvin quickly bandaged Sebastian's wound, and Jack helped Sebastian sit up.

Charles said, "You guys go out first."

Marvin and Jack didn't respond but looked at Sebastian in unison.

After all, Sebastian was their boss, and they only listened to him!

When Sebastian nodded, Marvin and Jack left the room.

The door closed, leaving only Charles and Sebastian in the room.

Isabella hid behind the curtains, feeling like a thief.

She had never felt so thrilled in her life!

Feeling Charles approaching, Isabella held her breath nervously, her fingers tightly gripping the curtains.

Just as Charles was about to take another step forward, Sebastian spoke calmly, "Where's my mom's photo?"

Charles halted in his tracks.

"You used to stand by my mother's bedside, promising her that you would honor her in our home before she took her final breath. But you broke that promise, Charles Landon!"

"Is that how you address me?" Charles turned around, looking coldly at Sebastian. There was no fatherly love in his eyes, only coldness and disdain. "The thing I regret most in my life is giving you life, having you as my son!"

"My mom gave birth to me, not you!" Sebastian roared.

Sebastian suddenly stood up, raising a fist to punch Charles.

But Sebastian was blind and limited in movement. Although he swung his fist with all his might, Charles easily dodged it.

Failing to hit Charles, Sebastian stumbled a few steps, almost losing his balance.

Sebastian tried to get up, but Charles stepped directly on his hand.

The hard leather shoe pressed heavily on Sebastian's hand, crushing not only his hand but also his dignity.

Charles stood tall and imposing, looking down at Sebastian with a superior sneer. "Sebastian, you bear the Landon name, a name I gave you. Your life, your everything is thanks to me. In this world, sons listen to their fathers."

Sebastian knelt on one knee, letting out a series of cold laughs. "Listen to you?"

At first, he just chuckled.

Then, Sebastian's laughter grew louder.

The entire room was filled with his laughter.

"Stop laughing!" Charles finally snapped, his voice cold.

"Hahaha," Sebastian seemed not to hear his scolding, laughing even harder.

Charles's teeth clenched, his anger boiling over. He pressed down harder on Sebastian's hand, as if trying to crush not just his hand but his very essence. The more Sebastian laughed, the harder Charles pressed.

But even so, it couldn't quell the resentment in Charles' heart.

As he looked at Sebastian, his mind was flooded with another face. Unlike Sebastian's harsh features, the face in his memory was gentle and beautiful, especially the eyes-soft and full of affection, capable of drawing someone in with just one look.

From behind the curtains, Isabella watched with a pained expression, her teeth clenched tightly.

She didn't expect Charles to be so cruel to his own son, Sebastian!

Charles suddenly withdrew his foot.

Isabella breathed a sigh of relief, only to see Charles return and throw something on the ground.

With a clatter, the object hit the ground.

The thing touched Sebastian's hand. Although he couldn't see, he seemed to sense it and instantly stopped laughing.

Sebastian reached out and held the object in his arms, his fingers stroking it, his expression gradually tightening.

Isabella saw clearly that it was a photo frame.

She couldn't see what was written on it, but from Sebastian's reaction, she could guess that it was likely a photo frame of his mother, Anna Scott!

"Keep laughing?" Charles sneered, a malicious satisfaction in his voice. "Why the sudden silence? Can't you laugh now?"

Sebastian held the frame close to his chest, as if clutching a living being.

With a crack, the photo frame broke in half.

Sebastian froze!

Charles was momentarily stunned.

Without warning, Sebastian sprang to his feet and swung a punch at Charles.

This time, Charles didn't dodge and took the hit squarely.

He staggered a few steps, barely standing, half of his face numb.

Before Charles could react, Sebastian charged at him again, hitting him with the photo frame, shouting, "Get out! Get out!"

###chapter 226 Who Did It

Charles furrowed his brows, looking at Sebastian who was already insane. He hesitated for a moment before finally opening the door and stepping out.

As soon as Charles came out, half of a picture frame flew out and hit him squarely on the back.

With a clang, it fell to the ground.

Jack and Marvin rushed in, pinned Sebastian down, and tried to calm him.

Charles bent down to pick up the half of the picture frame from the ground, glanced at it, and his expression turned cold.

He looked up at the scene in the room, his gaze sweeping over the curtains, then left with the half picture frame.

Jack closed the door. When Isabella emerged from behind the curtains, she saw Marvin injecting something into Sebastian.

"What is that?" Isabella asked.

"Sedative," Marvin replied without looking up, efficiently pushing the remaining half of the syringe in.

After receiving a sedative, Sebastian gradually calmed down, though his face remained etched with pain. Lying flat on the bed, he clutched the broken frame in his hand, his blind eyes wide open. Silent tears trickled from the corners of his eyes.

Jack, unable to bear the sight, turned to Isabella and offered an explanation. "Since you 'died,' Mr. Landon has been like this. His moods have been all over the place, and at one point, he even tried to end his own life. We had no choice but to sedate him. He was improving after your return, but something just set him off again."

Jack couldn't bear to watch and turned to explain to Isabella, "Since you disappeared, Mr. Landon has been like this. His emotions are often unstable, and he even attempted suicide at one point. We had no choice but to give him sedatives. He was indeed getting better after you came back, but I don't know what Charles did to provoke him just now."

"I know!" Isabella interrupted, her eyes welling up.

She had witnessed everything just now; Charles was truly despicable!

Sebastian was right; Charles didn't deserve to be a father at all!

"You guys go out first," Isabella said, "I want to stay with him."

Jack nodded but didn't forget to remind her, "Five minutes, okay? I'm afraid if it's too long, they'll get suspicious."

"Okay." Isabella nodded gently.

She walked over, sat by the bed, and held Sebastian's hand. "Sebastian."

Sebastian closed his eyes. "I'm sorry."

Isabella shook her head, tears uncontrollably rolling down. "It's not your fault, Sebastian. I saw everything. Charles doesn't deserve to be your father!"

Sebastian wore a cold smile. "He said he regretted having me, but Bella, do you know? I regret being born into this world. How am I any different from the orphans in the orphanage?"

Isabella tightened her grip on his hand. "I didn't know before, but I won't let it happen again. You have me and Sweetie."

Sebastian smiled. "Yes, I have you and Sweetie."

Perhaps the sedative was taking effect; he mumbled a couple of sentences and then fell into a deep sleep.

Isabella sat quietly for a moment, then took the half picture frame from his hand.

Isabella turned the broken edge of the frame over and frowned.

The break was a very neat, straight line, with no rough edges, looking more like it had been pre-cut with a knife and then broken with force.

Isabella's heart tightened.

She thought, 'Who did this?

'Charles or Emma?'

The Landon family living room was quiet. Isabella had just come down the stairs when she bumped into Leo.

Isabella's face stiffened.

Leo walked over and took her hand. "Where did you go?"

Isabella hesitated and lied, "Looking for you."

Leo smiled at this. "Why didn't you call me? Wouldn't that have been easier?"

"I didn't think of it." Isabella wasn't good at lying. Leo's gaze was fixed on her lips, which were still numb from Sebastian's intense kiss, probably quite noticeable.

Isabella bit her lip, afraid of being found out.

Footsteps sounded behind her, and Isabella instinctively wanted to turn around, but Leo suddenly pulled her.

She took two uncontrollable steps forward and pressed against Leo.

Leo wrapped one arm around Isabella's waist and cupped the back of her neck with his other hand, lowering his head for a kiss.

Isabella, startled, recoiled and managed to avoid his kiss. However, his hand still rested on her neck, leaving them so close that their breaths mingled. From behind, it looked very intimate.

Emma deliberately cleared her throat.

Isabella came to her senses and pushed Leo, who let go in response to her push.

Emma walked over, her gaze scrutinizing their faces. When she saw Isabella's slightly swollen lips, she nodded in satisfaction. "I was just wondering where Bella went. Turns out you were with Leo."

Leo held Isabella's hand. "Sorry to make you catch us at an inconvenient moment."

"What's there to be sorry about? I was young once too, and you two are about to get married. It's nothing." Emma said.

At this moment, Emily returned with some clothes.

Watching her hurriedly go upstairs, Isabella frowned in thought.

Isabella and Leo sat downstairs for a while, but Emily didn't come down anymore.

As it was almost time for dinner, even Emma was nowhere to be seen.

Isabella felt uneasy, as if something was about to happen.

Leo handed her a peeled orange segment.

Isabella took it but held it in her hand, murmuring, "Thank you."

Leo glanced at her. "What are you thinking about?"

"Nothing." Isabella replied.

Just then, a servant came to call them for dinner.

Soon, Sebastian and Emily came down.

As soon as they sat down, Charles also came down.

Isabella looked behind him but didn't see Emma.

"Everyone, sit down and eat," Charles said.

Emily asked, "Where's Emma?"

"Oh, she's not feeling well and is resting in her room," Charles replied expressionlessly.

"Not feeling well?" Emily put down her fork and was about to get up. "I'll go check on her."

"No need" Charles interrupted Emily, "Emma is already asleep. Let her rest; don't disturb her."

Since he said so, Emily couldn't insist and sat back down.

Isabella's gaze remained fixed on Charles, her suspicion palpable. Maybe her stare was too intense because Charles eventually looked over.

Their eyes met, and Isabella didn't shy away. She simply furrowed her brow slightly.

Charles coolly averted his gaze and didn't look at her again.

During dinner, Charles and Leo discussed the Northhaven project.

Isabella paused; she remembered that land belonged to Sebastian.

She had even gone to inspect it with Sebastian, and he had cooked a meal for her in a restaurant there.

###chapter 227 Jerks Only Love Leftovers

After that meal, Isabella felt that Sebastian wasn't so unapproachable.

Isabella was aware that Charles had been causing trouble covertly, stealing a significant amount of business from the Landon Group. She didn't know the specifics, but now it seemed that the Northhaven land had also become Charles' possession.

Although Isabella didn't know what Sebastian wanted with that land, the fact that Sebastian personally went to inspect it showed that he valued it highly.

Now that Charles had taken it, Sebastian must be frustrated.

Isabella looked at Sebastian with concern.

Because he was blind, Sebastian couldn't see her gaze.

While Charles and Leo were talking, Sebastian just sat quietly, eating whatever Emily fed him.

He was obedient, like a lifeless puppet.

Perhaps it was telepathy; Sebastian suddenly turned his head and looked in Isabella's direction.

Although he couldn't see anything, Sebastian smiled at her.

That smile made Isabella's heartache. Sebastian was telling her not to worry, and he was fine.

"Sebastian," Emily called out to him, holding food up to his lips.

As the food touched his lips, Sebastian opened his mouth but accidentally brushed against Emily's finger.

Emily blushed, her cheeks quickly turning a deep red. She nervously pressed her lips together.

Before the blush could fully bloom, Sebastian leaned forward and spat the food out of his mouth in one swift motion. He hadn't even chewed it.

It was clear he was unsettled by the contact with Emily's finger.

Emily was stunned and asked, "What's wrong? Is it not to your taste?"

Sebastian took a napkin to wipe his mouth and said indifferently, "Please don't feed me with your hands next time. It's dirty!"

In front of everyone, Sebastian embarrassed her.

Emily felt her face burning with embarrassment.

After that, she never fed Sebastian again.

Charles withdrew his gaze and said, "In two days, it's your wedding. Tonight, I've arranged for you to go to Springfield Hot Springs. I've already made arrangements there and cleared the place, because I know young people nowadays have pre-wedding anxiety. After dinner, the four of you can head over there, soak in the hot springs, and relax."

Leo nodded.

Emily had no objections either.

Isabella and Sebastian didn't need to express their opinions, since they were already arranged to go anyway.

Isabella stood up. "I'm going to the restroom."

Charles immediately arranged for someone to take her.

In the restroom, Isabella said to the servant, "My period just started. Could you please get me a sanitary pad?"

The servant was taken aback, nodded, and left.

Isabella closed the restroom door, crossed the hall, and went upstairs.

She reached the master bedroom and knocked on the door. "Emma, are you in there?"

No one responded.

Isabella waited for a moment and then reached for the doorknob.

But just as her fingers touched the handle and she was about to turn it, a voice suddenly came from behind. "Isabella!"

Isabella was startled and quickly turned around to see Charles, who had appeared out of nowhere.

She was shocked, a flash of panic crossing her face, but Isabella quickly smiled, "Charles, I came up to check on Emma."

Charles walked over, scrutinizing her and saying with a tone full of authority. "Isabella, I know exactly what you're up to."

Isabella frowned.

Charles went on to say, "A touch of cleverness is commendable; however, excessive wit or misapplied intelligence can be detrimental."

"Charles, the photo frame was cut!" Isabella said.

Charles glanced at her, his eyes filled with malice. "What are you trying to say?"

"I just want to know if it was you or Emma who did it!" Isabella came to find Emma to confirm this.

Charles was silent for a moment and then said, "What's the difference?"

Isabella was taken aback, then laughed. "Right. I forgot, you and Emma are interdependant. Whether it was you or her, you all want to harm Sebastian. Indeed, there's no difference!"

Charles frowned in displeasure. "For Leo's sake, I won't argue with you. Isabella, if anyone in this game disobeys, I can't guarantee your daughter's life!"

Isabella gritted her teeth and sneered. "If I were you, I wouldn't use a baby as a shield. After all, if word gets out, it would be laughable!"

"You!" Charles was infuriated.

But Isabella didn't give him a chance to speak further and walked away.

Charles watched her leave, snorted coldly, and entered the bedroom.

Locking the door, Charles walked step by step to the bed.

Emma lay on the bed, eyes open but looking weak.

She spoke, her voice also weak. "Charles, I was wrong. Please forgive me this time. I won't dare again."

Charles stood by the bed, looking at her expressionlessly. "Did you hear what was just said?"

Emma nodded weakly. The drug was still affecting her, and she could only blink to show she had heard.

Charles said, "Isabella was wrong about one thing. In everything, you and I are interdependant. But not when it comes to Anna!"

Emma's eyes were wide open, but she said nothing.

Charles' cold gaze fell on her. "Emma, since you dare ruin Anna's photos, you'll have to face the consequences. Spend these next couple of days in bed reflecting on your actions. You can come out on the wedding day."

"Charles," Emma called weakly.

But Charles didn't look back and left the bedroom.

The sound of the door locking echoed, and the footsteps faded away.

Emma closed her eyes in despair.

Regarding these two weddings, the Landon family made a big splash. The news went viral in just half a day.

According to tradition, the best man and maid of honor must be unmarried.

Isabella didn't have many friends, so she called Miley and Kelsey.

For convenience, Miley temporarily stayed at the Jose family's residenceÂ for the next two days.

The place had plenty of rooms. Margaret specifically had a room cleared for Isabella and another room for storing items.

When Isabella came back to pack, Miley had just come out of Zaire's room.

Miley's lips were a bit red, and her hair was slightly messy. She straightened her collar and walked over. "Bella, where are you going?"

"Springfield Hot Springs." Isabella looked at Miley's reddened eyes. "Are you and Zaire back together?"

A while ago, Miley and Zaire had a falling out over Susan.

Isabella didn't know the details. Miley had complained to her a few times on WhatsApp.

###chapter 228 Springfield Hot Springs

Miley tossed her hair back with a playful gesture. "It's just about needs and wants, really. What's the big deal?"

Just then, Zaire appeared.

In stark contrast to Miley's slightly tousled look, Zaire was impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, exuding an air of sophistication.

"What are you two gossiping about?" Zaire asked as he approached.

Miley raised an eyebrow but didn't respond to him. Instead, she took Isabella's hand and asked, "Why are you and Leo going to Springfield Hot Springs ?"

Isabella shook her head. "Sebastian and Emily are coming too. Charles arranged it."

"Charles must be up to something again," Zaire said, "You four going sounds boring. Springfield Hot Springs has so many hot springs, so why not go together?"

Isabella said, "I don't mind. Charles said the place has already been cleared out." In fact, Charles had implied that everything had been arranged. If they wanted to mess around, it wouldn't work.

Isabella didn't know what Charles had planned for tonight, but as Zaire said, Charles was definitely up to no good.

She was actually quite nervous, afraid something might happen.

Zaire said, "That's simple. Just tell Nina to discuss the matter with Richard."

They talked as they went downstairs.

Coincidentally, they ran into Nina and Richard coming back together.

They were carrying bags full of things for Isabella.

Richard was true to his word. He had pushed aside all his tasks, devoting himself entirely to assisting her in selecting the items.

Their relationship had also warmed up over the past two days.

As they entered, Nina accidentally tripped. Richard's reflexes were quick; he reached out and steadied her by the waist.

Their eyes met, and Richard's gaze lingered. Nina looked at him for a few seconds before looking away.

"Nina," Isabella called out.

Nina looked over. When she saw the gazes of Isabella, Zaire, and Miley, her face involuntarily flushed for a moment.

Nina put the bags down. "Bella, I bought you some things. See if you like them."

Nina had been on a shopping spree, buying up everything imaginable.

The items had piled up in one entire room.

Every day, Nina would check what was missing and immediately rush out to buy more.

From lavish jewelry to everyday socks and towels, Nina bought everything she could think of and more. If there were something she couldn't immediately recall, she'd search online or consult Margaret.

Isabella looked at the mountain of items, bewildered by how Nina had managed to choose so much.

She held Nina's hand. "That's enough. It's already a lot."

Zaire said, "They're going to Springfield Hot Springs tonight. Nina, do you want to go?"

"Springfield Hot Springs?" Nina was surprised, "Why go so far?"

"Charles arranged it."

Nina got nervous. "What's he up to do?"

Isabella shook her head, not wanting Nina to worry too much. "Maybe it's a good intention?"

After she said that, the room fell silent for a few seconds.

Given the situation, no one believed Charles had good intentions.

"Springfield Hot Springs is Charles's territory. If he has something planned, Isabella and the others will be trapped." Zaire turned to Richard. "Richard, can you do something?"

The Jose family couldn't challenge Charles, but Richard was different.

With Richard's status and means, getting into Springfield Hot Springs would be a piece of cake.

Richard didn't answer immediately. He first exchanged a glance with Zaire, then turned his gaze towards Nina.

Everyone knew Richard only listened to Nina now.

Zaire caught on quickly and asked, "Nina, are you in?"

Under normal circumstances, Nina would certainly avoid getting involved in such matters. However, given the current crisis, Nina couldn't help but feel concerned.

She turned to Richard. "Is it doable?"

Richard smiled but didn't answer.

Zaire raised an eyebrow and said, "I'll go pack my clothes."

As he left, he pulled Miley along with him.

Isabella's phone rang. It was Leo asking if she had packed her things.

Nina and Richard took the bags to the room.

As Nina was checking the items, Richard pulled her by the waist.

"Thinking of soaking in the hot springs?" Richard's voice was low, his embrace firm as though he wanted to merge with her.

Richard always hugged her tightly, as if he wanted to merge her into his body.

Nina nodded. "Yes. Can you manage it?"

"Yes."

Richard didn't elaborate, making Nina anxious.

Nina turned to face him. "Is it convenient?"

Richard looked at her deeply. "Whether it's convenient depends on you."

Richard's intentions were always clear in his eyes, never hidden.

Nina stood on tiptoe and pressed her lips to his.

Richard kept his eyes open, watching her.

As they locked eyes, Nina could even see her own reflection in his gaze.

His eyes, like him, were intense and commanding.

Nina closed her eyes, focusing all her attention on the kiss.

She could feel subtle changes in Richard's body. His arms tightened around her waist, and his form grew rigid like steel.

Just as Nina thought the kiss had lasted long enough, Richard suddenly lifted her by the waist.

Startled, Nina's eyes flew open to find herself being held against the door by Richard, who supported her with one hand.

He leaned in, deepening the kiss with a fierce intensity.

--

Isabella and the others arrived at Springfield Hot Springs first, greeted by the hotel manager who led them to their room.

The room was exquisite.

With the floor-to-ceiling curtains drawn back, a lush, green mountain view stretched out before them.

Isabella stood by the window for a moment, and Leo hugged her from behind.

Isabella stiffened and was about to push him away when she heard a click.

She turned to see Leo had let go and was looking at a photo he had just taken on his phone.

"This angle is great," Leo said, posting a status. "It's enough to report back."

Before Isabella could say anything, footsteps sounded outside.

The hotel manager's voice came through the door. "This is your room. Please rest. If you need anything, let me know."

Charles had already cleared the area in advance. When they arrived, the hotel was eerily quiet. The only people who could be staying at this hour were Emily and Sebastian.

What surprised her was that their rooms were right next to each other, separated by only a thin wall.

But knowing Nina and Richard were coming made Isabella feel a bit more at ease.

She hadn't told Leo about it, fearing it would alert Charles.

But even when Isabella went to the hot springs, she didn't see Richard and the others.

'Can it be that they can't get in?' Isabella pondered.

###chapter 229 How Do Your Lives Stack up Against That

The water in the hot spring pool was clear. Leo had already entered the water, while Isabella stood on the shore, looking around.

The water rippled as Leo stood in the pool, reaching out his hand. "Bella?"

Isabella hesitated for a moment but eventually extended her hand.

She stood on the steps in the water, the warm water covering her calves.

Leo reached out to take the towel wrapped around her, but Isabella shrank back.

Leo laughed. "You don't plan to soak like this, do you?"

Isabella was wearing a swimsuit underneath and had draped a large bath towel over herself when she left the room. Only her legs were exposed.

"What's wrong with soaking like this?" Isabella retorted, clutching the corner of the towel even tighter, her eyes filled with wariness as she gazed at Leo.

Marriage was a reluctant decision for her, and she certainly didn't plan to do anything more with him.

"Fine." Leo withdrew his hand. "As long as you're happy."

The hot spring was surrounded by trees, and as night fell, the small night lights in the roadside bushes lit up. The surrounding light was dim, enveloping the rare tranquility.

The warm water made the body feel soft.

Isabella, who hadn't rested well since giving birth, began to sweat lightly within half an hour.

The water rippled as Leo approached.

Isabella's eyes widened, instantly becoming alert.

But Leo only handed her a cup of steaming coffee. "It was just brewed. Drink some to sweat it out."

"Thank you." Isabella indeed felt very thirsty, but she was afraid of falling into a trap. So, although she took the cup, she didn't drink it and just held it in her hand.

Leo glanced at her, then poured himself a few cups and drank them down. He leaned back and gazed at the dim forest, asking, "Isabella, do you know what Charles has planned for us tonight?"

Isabella was startled and looked at him in confusion.

Leo smiled and continued, "This seemingly deserted hotel is actually full of eyes. From the moment we entered the hotel, countless photos have been taken of us. Even our every move here in the hot spring is being captured."

Isabella felt a pang of unease. She glanced around but saw only the tranquil darkness of the night.

Yet, it felt as though there were hidden eyes watching her, creating an unsettling feeling despite their invisibility.

"Stop looking," Leo said, "You won't find them."

Isabella withdrew her gaze. "Charles' spies?"

He shook his head. "It's the city's media and paparazzi, the kind that specializes in secretly photographing the secrets of the wealthy."

Isabella began to understand that this was to create a buzz for them.

Surely by tomorrow morning, the news of the two newlywed couples soaking in Springfield Hot Springs, accompanied by various explicit photos, would be all over the city.

"Charles is really putting in a lot of effort," Isabella said coldly, then looked at Leo. "Why are you telling me this?"

Leo's expression was somewhat helpless. "If I don't tell you, you'll keep overthinking and keep your distance from me. Isabella, I don't want you to keep your distance from me."

He suddenly reached out and grabbed Isabella's wrist. Using the buoyancy of the water, he easily pulled Isabella over.

Leo lowered his head, his wet fingers touching Isabella's cheek, and said hoarsely, "Bella, if you refuse tonight, Sebastian will be dragged into this too. It's over between you two. Can't you at least consider me? I swear, I'll treat you right!"

"Leo, let go!" Isabella struggled.

The water churned around them.

It was then that Isabella noticed Leo's flushed face and heavy breathing, his gaze filled with a predatory intensity.

Leo looked like a hungry wolf, staring intently at Isabella. He wrapped his arm around Isabella's waist, pressing her against the pool, and leaned in to kiss her.

"Leo!" Isabella kicked him with all her might, but instead of pushing him away, she only made the water splash more.

In a pavilion on the second floor not far away, two paparazzi were watching intently through a black camera.

"Isn't this crazy?" one of them said.

"Live streaming, no less. This is way more exciting than those edited videos," replied the other.

"If this goes live tomorrow, it'll cause a sensation in the entire city!"

"Entire city? If this airs, it'll be a nationwide!"

"Quick, take the shot!"

Suddenly, a foot came flying from behind.

The two paparazzi each took a kick and were knocked to the ground.

"Ouch!"

"Who was that?"

The paparazzi turned to see Michael standing there, his face instantly shifting from aggression to a forced smile. "Michael, what a surprise!"

"Michael, what a coincidence. You're here for the hot springs too?"

Michael sat down, dusting off his black clothes."Do I look like I'm here to soak in the hot springs?"

Not at all!

Michael was dressed head to toe, completely out of place for a relaxing soak. Besides, Charles had mentioned that aside from the four newlyweds, everyone else at Springfield Hot Springs tonight was paparazzi.

Michael worked underground, answering to Richard, with no known ties to Charles or the Jose family. His presence here was certainly unexpected.

Michael settled into a chair and glanced at the camera. "So, what are you filming?"

The two paparazzi exchanged nervous glances, forcing smiles. "Just catching some gossip."

Michael chuckled. "Do you know Richard has a deal here tonight?"

"No, we didn't know!"

They only knew there was big gossip tonight, nothing else.

Michael said nothing, merely cast a dismissive glance at the two of them, and tapped his fingers lightly on the table.

Those two taps felt like two heavy hammers on the paparazzi's hearts.

Michael, Richard, and the First Casino-everyone knew their clout, though ordinary folks might not grasp the full scope. But for paparazzi, the hierarchy was clear.

In Lakina, there wasn't a high society figure they wouldn't dare to photograph or cross.

Except for the First Casino. The First Casino was untouchable.

After all, when it came to life-threatening matters, who would risk their own life?

The two paparazzi understood instantly and were about to leave with the camera. "Michael, we'll leave right away."

"Wait!" Michael said, "Leave the camera, and you can go!"

The paparazzi, holding their cameras, looked conflicted. "Michael, you know, for us, we can lose anything, but not our cameras."

Michael's smile turned menacing. "And how do your lives stack up against that?"

The paparazzi were speechless.

When the two paparazzi left the pavilion, their faces were full of sorrow.

Kelsey was waiting nearby and ran up after they left.

Michael was checking the contents of the camera. Hearing footsteps, he put the camera away and raised an eyebrow at Kelsey. "Kelsey?"

"Did you intercept it?" Kelsey was only interested in the camera in his hand and reached out to grab it.

Michael moved his hand to the side, causing Kelsey to miss and lose her balance, falling straight into Michael's arms.

###chapter 230 Give Me an Answer

"Ms. Jose, is this how you usually throw yourself at people?" Michael's taunting voice came from above.

Kelsey felt a flush of embarrassment. She tried to pull away, but Michael tugged her closer.

She ended up sprawled across his lap, looking up at him. "What do you want?"

Michael leaned in close to her face, grinning. "What am I doing? How about making love with you?"

Kelsey was stunned for a couple of seconds by his crude words. As a lady raised in a wealthy family, the most vulgar thing she had ever heard was something like 'damn.'

Seeing her flushed cheeks, Michael laughed even harder. He pulled Kelsey's hand, bringing her even closer. "Well, yes or no? Give me an answer."

Kelsey finally snapped out of it. She broke free from his grip and stood up abruptly, raising her hand to slap him.

Michael quickly caught her hand. In an instant, he stood up and cornered Kelsey.

Kelsey was forced to step back, and in her anger, she raised another hand to strike.

Once again, Michael caught her hand.

Both of her hands were now held by Michael, and she was backed up against the railing, her waist pressing against it.

Michael leaned in. "Yes or no?"

Kelsey was at a loss for words.

At that moment, she finally realized that Michael wasn't joking.

He was seriously asking her this question and was very persistent about getting an answer.

Kelsey was bewildered. "Do you even know what you're saying?"

Michael smiled. "Of course I do."

He turned his head, his lips brushing against Kelsey's cheek, stopping at her ear. "Actually, the first time I saw you, I wanted to do this. Having sex with me feels great. So, do you want to try?"

Kelsey couldn't believe what she was hearing. She cursed, "Michael, you are so shameless !"

Michael didn't seem to care and smiled. "If you don't answer, I'll think you agreed."

As he spoke, he freed one hand and started to slip it under her clothes.

Kelsey screamed and stomped her foot in panic. "Michael, if you touch me, I'll cut off your hand!"

Michael's low laugh sent shivers down her spine. "Threatening me, huh? I can make sure you won't be getting out of bed for three days. Believe me?"

With that, he lowered his head and sucked on her neck.

A tingling sensation spread from her neck, making Kelsey stiffen as she felt all the blood in her body rush to that spot.

At that moment, another figure hurried into Kelsey's wide-eyed view.

"Jack, Jack, help me!" Kelsey shouted, her voice trembling.

The next second, the weight on her body disappeared as Michael was pulled away by Jack, who threw a punch at Michael.

Michael's skills were superior to Jack's.

Jack's punch missed as Michael dodged, and Michael retaliated with a blow of his own.

Jack winced in pain, bending slightly, the veins on his forehead bulging.

"Jack!" Kelsey called out, running over to support him. "Are you okay?"

Jack was in too much pain to speak.

Kelsey's eyes welled up as she glared at Michael. "Michael, you've crossed the line!"

Michael smiled slightly, seemingly indifferent. "Think about my question and give me an answer."

With that, he walked away.

Kelsey called after Michael, "No need to think. Even if you were the last man on earth, I wouldn't have sex with you!"

Michael paused, nodded, and his face turned icy. "In that case, stop leading me on!"

With that, he walked away briskly.

"You!" Kelsey was so angry that she wanted to chase after him and demand an explanation.

She thought, 'When have I ever led Michael on?

'It's Michael's own indecency, isn't it?'

Jack grabbed her. "Let it go."

Seeing Jack's pale face, Kelsey had no choice but to give up. "Are you okay?"

"Yeah." Jack replied.

Kelsey noticed Jack didn't look well. "Wait here. I'll go find a doctor."

As she turned to leave, Jack grabbed her hand.

"Don't go." Jack's slightly hoarse voice reached her ears.

Kelsey was stunned and looked back at Jack. "What did you say?"

She thought, 'Is Jack asking me to stay?'

That gentle tone was so unlike Jack's usual aloofness.

Kelsey was taken aback and couldn't quite process if she had actually heard those words from Jack, or if she was just imagining things.

She stared at Jack, dumbfounded, until Jack awkwardly averted his eyes, licked his lips, and added in an even more uncomfortable manner, "I mean, I'm fine, no need for a doctor."

Kelsey found it amusing.

She never expected that the usually decisive Jack, who always followed Sebastian, could be so sheepish.

Holding back her laughter, Kelsey replied seriously, "Oh."

After a pause, she added, "If you're fine, then why are you holding my hand?"

Jack was speechless.

As if Kelsey's comment had just registered, Jack slowly loosened his grip, muttering, "Sorry."

Kelsey glared at Jack, feeling both amused and annoyed.

She thought, 'IÂ only said that on purpose. I didn't mean Jack can't hold her hand.

'Why did Jack let go so easily?'

After resting for a few minutes, Jack straightened up. "I'm fine now. Let's go."

Before he could finish, he met Kelsey's angry eyes and froze.

"What's wrong?" Jack asked sincerely.

But his concern didn't make Kelsey happy. Instead, she rolled her eyes, seemingly exasperated with him.

"Blockhead!" she snapped, and turned on her heel, heading downstairs.

Jack was speechless.

By the poolside, Isabella had already pushed Leo away and emerged dripping from the water, running towards the hotel.

As she exited the elevator, she ran into Nina.

"Nina." Seeing Nina, Isabella calmed down instantly.

Nina held out a dry towel and quickly replaced the wet one Isabella had been wearing as if she was already aware of everything that had happened at the hot spring.

"Nina, Sebastian and Emily?"

Nina held her hand to comfort her, "They're fine. Don't worry."

Isabella nodded.

Nina handed her a room key. "Go back and rest."

"Okay." Isabella nodded.

She definitely couldn't go back to the room Charles had arranged. Holding the room key, Isabella opened the door to another room.

As she stepped inside, before she could insert the key card to turn on the lights, she was pulled into an embrace.

The familiar scent filled her senses, and Isabella, momentarily stunned, then reached out to hug Sebastian tightly.

Sebastian embraced her for a moment, his warmth seemingly transferring to Isabella, who belatedly realized that her own body was becoming warm as well.

Sebastian kissed her deeply as they intertwined their breaths in the dark, empty room, merging into one another.

Leo returned to his room with a key card. The bed was noticeably lumpy, and a woman's voice could be heard faintly from under the covers.

She seemed to be in extreme discomfort, writhing slightly beneath the blanket.

Leo stood still for a moment, then removed his bathrobe and walked step by step towards the bed.

###chapter 231 Am I Crazy?

Â Leo bent down, hugging the human-shaped figure through the blanket, his voice hoarse. "Sorry, Bella, there was something in that pool."

Something that stirs emotions!

The woman under the blanket squirmed even more, making muffled sounds.

Leo said, "Bella, tonight you are mine, and Sebastian is with Emily. Charles said that as long as tonight goes well, the wedding the day after tomorrow will go smoothly. He has promised me that once we are married, he will send the child back.

"Bella, for the sake of the child, you are willing, right?"

"Mmm-mmm." The muffled figure under the blanket seemed to respond in some way.

Leo's eyes flickered with a hint of reluctance. He didn't want to resort to these methods, but his earlier attempt in the hot springs had failed. Perhaps using this approach to keep Isabella with him wasn't such a bad idea.

At least after tonight, Isabella would truly belong to him!

Then Leo reached out to pull down the blanket directly.

Just as Leo was about to lean in for a kiss, he froze when he saw the woman's face clearly.

He turned on the room's main light.

The light illuminated everything in the room.

The woman under the blanket, with her hands and feet tied and her mouth taped shut, was actually Emily!

Emily's eyes widened as she struggled, desperately trying to say something.

Leo tore the tape off her mouth. "What are you doing here?"

"Hurry, go find Sebastian and Isabella, hurry!" Emily shouted urgently!

Leo was jolted, suddenly realizing the gravity of the situation.

Emily had been sent to his bed, so it was obvious who Isabella was with now!

Leo grabbed a bathrobe and put it on as he walked to the door. As soon as he opened it, a crowd of people rushed in.

Before he could see who they were, he heard the sound of cameras clicking.

"What's going on?" Emily poked her head out from the bed.

In an instant, all the cameras turned towards her, snapping away in a frenzy.

Emily stood there in stunned silence before letting out a scream.

Her disheveled state was captured in full, with her tied up, it all looked like some scandalous affair.

A couple on the verge of marriage caught up in a steamy rendezvous during a hot springs trip.

This would make headlines for weeks!

"Stop taking pictures!" No matter how much Emily shouted, no one listened to her. The camera flashes were almost blinding her.

"Leo!" Emily couldn't take it anymore. She was completely at their mercy with her hands and feet tied. What infuriated her more was that Leo was just standing there, doing nothing!

"Stop them!" Emily shouted.

After a moment, Leo finally spoke, "Have you taken enough pictures?"

The media's cameras gradually quieted down.

Leo's gaze swept over everyone, his face angry. "This is a misunderstanding. None of the photos taken today are allowed to be released!"

The paparazzi exchanged glances, clearly taken aback.

"Mr. Anderson, we received a tip from Mr. Landon that there would be explosive news tonight. So we were waiting here, and Mr. Landon didn't lie. This is indeed big news. Now that we've taken the photos, you say we can't release them? Mr. Anderson, you should at least respect our profession!"

"Exactly! You did something scandalous, but now you won't let us report it?"

"No!" Emily shouted, "It's not what it looks like. Can't you see my hands and feet are tied? We were set up."

Someone laughed. "Miss Lopez, if Sebastian knew you were into this kind of thing, would he still want you?"

Emily was stunned.

"Yeah," someone echoed, "Even if we believe in your innocence, will Sebastian believe you when he finds out?"

Emily's face drained of color, her nails digging painfully into her palms. She knew that, at this point, the damage was likely irreparable.

Leo rubbed his temples and said, "Name your price. How much to delete the photos?"

The paparazzi looked at each other but said nothing.

Leo said, "I know how much you can make from a photo or a news story. You're just working for your company. How about this? Name a price, and I'll buy the photos. You'll make a quick buck, much faster than your salary."

Emily, hearing this, regained some hope. "Yes, pay them!"

As long as they bought the photos, the news wouldn't spread.

The paparazzi thought for a moment, possibly thinking it was a good deal, and asked, "How much are you offering, Mr. Anderson?"

Leo glanced around, roughly estimating there were about a dozen of them. He frowned and thought for a moment, then said, "One million dollars each. That's my best offer."

Emily breathed a sigh of relief.

One million dollars was a lot for a paparazzo.

She thought no paparazzo here would refuse that amount!

To her surprise, the paparazzi were stunned and then laughed.

"One million dollars? Mr. Anderson, these photos of you and Miss Lopez are worth far more than that!"

"Seriously? We thought Mr. Anderson was actually serious about this. But a million bucks? That's what you'd give a homeless person!"

Emily was stunned again, thinking, 'Have the paparazzi become so avaricious nowadays?

'One million dollars isn't enough?'

She looked at Leo.

Leo frowned, clearly displeased. "How much do you want?"

The laughter gradually stopped.

"Mr. Anderson, considering you just took over the Anderson Group, we're talking at least a hundred million dollars each," one of them declared.

"Yeah, one hundred million dollars each."

Leo snorted in disbelief. "Am I crazy, or are you guys off your rocker?"

One hundred million dollars each? They really dared to ask!

The paparazzi, however, were dead serious. "We're not joking. Besides, other bidders are offering us much more. Just think-if we hold out for a better offer, we not only get a huge payday but also get to break the story. It's a win-win!"

Leo's expression turned cold. "Is it Sebastian or Zaire?"

He couldn't believe that either of them would be foolish enough to offer more than a million dollars.

"It's me!"

A voice came from the crowd.

Emily's body trembled uncontrollably when she heard the voice.

She slowly lifted her gaze to the figure standing at the doorway, instantly feeling a heavy, dark shadow loom over her. Her mind raced, flashing through scenes like a movie reel.

Leo looked at the newcomer, a mocking smile on his face. "Kevin?"

Yes, it was Kevin, the eldest son of the Anderson family.

Without a word, Kevin walked up and kicked Leo.

Kevin, wearing leather shoes, delivered a fierce kick to Leo's abdomen, causing excruciating pain.

###chapter 232 Forever the Illegitimate Child

Leo crouched down in pain, cold sweat dripping from his forehead.

"You bastard!" Kevin sneered coldly. "Do you think that by taking over the Anderson Group with Charles' help, you can establish yourself in Lakina?"

A flurry of camera flashes went off, capturing Kevin's kick in full view of the media.

"In front of me, you'll always be a bastard!" Kevin pointed at Leo and raised his voice."Everyone, take a good look. Even if he used some tricks to take over the Anderson Group, Leo is still just a bastard. In the Anderson family, he'll always be a disgrace. Today, I'm going to clean up the family for my father!"

As Kevin lifted his foot for another strike, the paparazzi quickly raised their cameras, eager to capture every thrilling moment.

In the world of high society scandals, aside from affairs, nothing was more exhilarating than a family feud.

Any drama between Leo and Kevin was pure gold for the entertainment media. With such juicy material practically served up on a silver platter, there was no way they'd miss their chance.

But this time, Kevin's kick missed its mark.

Leo sidestepped with surprising agility, dodging the strike before Kevin could react. Seizing the opportunity, Leo swung his leg around and landed a solid kick to Kevin's lower back.

A collective gasp erupted from the crowd.

The paparazzi stumbled backward, along with Kevin, who was sent crashing out the door.

Before anyone could process what had happened, the door slammed shut with a resounding thud.

Kevin clumsily got up from the ground, holding his waist. "You all saw that, right? I trust I don't need to instruct you on tomorrow's headline."

The commotion at the door gradually subsided.

Leo put on his clothes, glanced at the display screen on the door, then grabbed his coat and prepared to leave.

At that moment, Emily rushed over from behind and hugged him tightly.

Leo was taken aback. "What are you doing?"

"Leo." Emily's voice trembled. "Sincethings have come to this point, should we..."

Leo pried her fingers off and stared at her face, mocking, "What are you thinking? You want me to touch you?"

"I know. I don't want to touch you either, but given the current situation, if things go wrong, do you think Charles will still help us?" Emily clutched his sleeve, her breathing slightly rapid. "Leo, I hate Kevin and Susan as much as you do. I hate everyone in the Anderson family. Our goal is the same. We all want to takerevenge and escape from their control!"

Leo stared at her for a few seconds. "Who said I'm like you?"

Emily was stunned.

Leo pulled his coat from her grasp and said calmly, "If it were a year ago, I might have slept with you just to disgust Kevin. But now, I want more than revenge; I want to stand tall and proud!"

"Leo." Emily called.

"Sorry, I can't help you."

With that, Leo strode out of the room.

As soon as Leo stepped out, he was apprehended by Richard's men.

He wanted to find Isabella, but it was impossible.

Instead, he was locked up in a small dark room for the entire night.

In the middle of the night, Isabella woke up.

She sat up abruptly, startling Sebastian beside her.

"What's wrong?" Sebastian sat up as well, wrapping his arms around her.

Isabella clutched his arm and said urgently, "Listen!"

"To what?" Sebastian asked.

"It sounds like Sweetie is crying." Isabella replied.

Sebastian remained silent.

Isabella shook his arm. "Did you hear it? It's right outside!"

Sebastian shook his head. He heard nothing.

Outside the window was a forest. Apart from the rustling of leaves in the breeze, there was nothing. Certainly no sound of a baby crying.

"I'll go check," Isabella said, putting on her slippers and hurriedly opening the door.

The moment the door swung open, the baby's cries abruptly ceased.

As the hallway lights spilled into the room, Isabella's sense of reality felt like it had been yanked out of a dream. The stark contrast left her with a profound sense of sadness, an emotion that was almost too complex to articulate.

Sebastian groped his way over and hugged her. "Bella?"

Isabella started to cry. "I really heard Sweetie crying, Sebastian, you have to believe me!"

Sebastian held her tightly, gently patting her back to comfort her, "I believe you."

Footsteps approached.

Jack arrived with two others, looking puzzled at the scene. "Mr. Landon, what happened?"

Sebastian instructed, "Immediately conduct a thorough search of the entire hotel. Don't miss a single corner!"

Jack was a bit confused. "What are we looking for?"

"A child!"

"Alright!" Jack immediately became serious, not daring to waste a moment, and quickly set about making arrangements.

Isabella and Sebastian waited in the room for an hour.

When Jack returned, he brought disappointing news."The entire hotel has been thoroughly searched, but no trace of a child was found."

Isabella closed her eyes, frustrated.

"Search again!" Sebastian demanded.

Jack hesitated but said, "But we've already searched every detail."

"Search again, more thoroughly!" Sebastian interrupted him, "Don't overlook any corners!"

Jack nodded in agreement.

As he turned to leave, Isabella stopped him. "Wait! No need to search anymore."

Jack paused and looked at Sebastian.

Sebastian was silent for a moment, then said, "Search one more time, the last time!"

Jack left.

Isabella felt sad deeply. "Sebastian, maybe I was just hallucinating."

It wasn't the first time. Ever since Sweetie had been with her for a few days and then taken away, Isabella had often had trouble sleeping, frequently feeling as if Sweetie was right beside her.

But every time Isabella opened her eyes, there was nothing.

The harshness of reality kept breaking her down, leaving her struggling to distinguish between dreams and waking life. It was like the moment she doubted if it was all just a dream, she still felt compelled to search.

And the result was always disheartening.

Sebastian held her hand and said softly, "Whether it's a hallucination or not, we have to search! What if?"

Yes.

What if?

What if it wasn't a hallucination?

Sebastian would rather take a chance than give up and miss something.

"I'm sorry, Bella. I failed to protect you both," Sebastian said through gritted teeth.

Isabella sensed a hint of danger and turned to him. "What are you planning to do?"

Sebastian just smiled gently and hugged her. "Bella, do you believe me? If I see the child, I'll recognize her at first sight!"

Isabella pictured Sweetie in her mind, her lips curling into a gentle smile. "Sebastian, she's really adorable. She is so small and well-behaved."

"Mr. Landon!" Jack burst in, his voice shaky. "We found a child!"

###chapter 233 The Abandoned Kid

In another suite of the hotel, the room was filled with people.

When Isabella and Sebastian hurried in, all eyes turned towards them.

Isabella's gaze was drawn to the blood-stained swaddle on the table.Her steps faltered, a wave of urgency making her want to rush over to the blanket, but her legs felt leaden, refusing to move.

"Bella," Nina stepped forward and took her hand. "I checked; it's indeed a girl. But..."

Because Isabella had already broken free from her hand and hurried towards the swaddle.

The baby girl in the swaddle let out a cry, hoarse and weak.

Isabella took one look, and her expression froze slightly.

Nina stood beside her and asked, "Is it?"

Isabella shook her head. "No."

With just one look, Isabella recognized that the baby girl in the swaddle was not her Sweetie.

It wasn't just that this baby was too small; the bloodstains, the dirt, and the umbilical cord still attached all told her that this baby had been born very recently. Sweetie, on the other hand, had been born nearly a month ago.

Nina had tried to mention earlier that this child looked freshly born, which didn't match with Isabella's timeline. But despite several searches, this was the first time they had found this baby.

Sebastian, holding Isabella's hand tightly, could not see the baby but could hear its cries. The sound, coupled with his thoughts of Sweetie, made his heart ache intensely. He had been waiting for Isabella to say, "This is our daughter, Sweetie," so he could reach out and take the baby. But when Isabella's response was a firm "no," the anticipation in his eyes seemed to extinguish.

Isabella felt as if Sebastian's grip was about to crush her hand. His strength was overwhelming. She turned her head away, unable to meet his gaze, tears streaming silently down her face.

Sebastian was slightly stunned, realizing his grip was too tight. He loosened his hold a bit and pulled Isabella into his arms. Facing the direction of the baby, he asked, "Where was she found?"

"The back mountain," Jack replied, "in the woods outside."

Sebastian pursed his lips. "So Bella wasn't hearing things, as our room is close to the back mountain."

Jack added, "We've already sent someone to check the surveillance. We should have results soon."

Before he finished speaking, hurried footsteps came from outside, and Michael walked in.

"No need to look, the child is hers."

Everyone's eyes turned toward the door as a young woman walked in, soaked to the bone. She wore a loose, dark-colored dress that was clearly maternity wear. Bloodstains marred her calves and shoes, and though the deep color of the dress masked any blood on it, she reeked of raw, iron-like blood.

The girl looked young, around twenty, with a pale face. One of her hands remained pressed against her abdomen, and with each step she took, she wavered, as if she might collapse at any moment.

Michael's voice was extremely cold. "Unmarried but pregnant, abandoning the child. These two charges together are quite serious."

The woman crumpled to the floor, her cries laced with a profound sense of helplessness.

Her soft sobs filled the room, mingling with the baby's cries from the table, creating an oppressive atmosphere that seemed to tear at Isabella's wounds all over again.

Isabella pushed Sebastian away and walked towards the girl, her eyes red. "Are you abandoning this child?"

The woman looked up in surprise, her eyes reflecting a complex swirl of emotions. Despite the turmoil in her gaze, Isabella could see clearly that this mother had not yet reached the point of being able to completely abandon her child.

"If you really don't want her, I'll find a good family for her. You can pretend you never gave birth to this child, and she will never know that her biological mother had abandoned her from birth."

The girl's lips trembled as if she wanted to say something. She looked at the swaddle on the table with reluctance, then closed her eyes in despair.

Isabella stood up. "Jack, please take this child away, the farther the better."

"Yes."

Jack stepped forward and had just picked up the swaddle when a scream was heard. The girl who had been sitting on the ground suddenly stood up and staggered towards the child. She snatched the swaddle from Jack's hands, took a few steps back, and cried heart-wrenchingly but held the baby tightly.

Seeing this, they breathed a sigh of relief.

Isabella held back her tears, took off her coat, and draped it over the girl's shoulders. "Since you can't bear to part with her, raise her well. I know the process will be difficult, but to the child, you are her whole world. If even you don't want her, that would be her greatest sorrow."

The girl looked at Isabella, tears streaming down her face, and finally said, with a hoarse voice, "Thank you."

Isabella arranged for someone to take the girl home and gave her some money. Then the matter was settled.

Nina returned to her bedroom, unable to hold back her tears.

There was a knock on the door. Nina went to open it and saw Richard standing outside.

Nina held the doorknob. "It's so late. Is there something you need?"

Richard saw her red eyes, his brow furrowed, and he pushed the door open and walked in. With Nina's strength, she couldn't stop him, so she let him into the room.

Richard closed the door and hugged her. "Why are you crying?"

"It's nothing." Nina's hands pressed against his chest. "It's late. If there's nothing else, you should go back to your room and rest."

Richard stared at her. "Which room? Don't you know I only booked one room?"

Nina knew what he meant and lowered her eyes. "Then let me get ready."

Richard had agreed to help, and she should repay him. Nina was a married woman. Richard's intentions towards her were never hidden. Tonight's events truly owe much to Richard; without him, they wouldn't have even gotten into the hotel.

Richard let go. "Alright. I'll wait for you in bed."

Even though she was mentally prepared, Nina still felt uneasy hearing his words.

Nina turned and went into the bathroom.

After taking a few deep breaths, Nina took off her clothes piece by piece. She quickly took a shower, put on a bathrobe, and walked out.

The lights in the room had been adjusted, emitting a warm glow. Richard was leaning on the bed, playing on his phone. Hearing the sound, he looked up, gazing at Nina.

Nina felt a bit awkward and walked over.

She sat on the edge of the bed, silent for a few seconds, and began to take off her bathrobe.

###chapter 234 Too Ruthless

First, Nina untied her belt, then she grasped the lapels of her robe, but she seemed to freeze, unable to move.

Richard looked at her, amused. "Why aren't you continuing?"

Nina gritted her teeth and took off the bathrobe.

The room was heated, but standing naked in front of Richard made her feel like she was in a cold abyss. Nina lifted a corner of the blanket and slipped under it.

She lay on top of Richard, waiting for him to make a move.

But Richard didn't move. Instead, he looked down at Nina. "Is that it?"

Nina worked up her courage and reached out to unbutton his shirt.

Richard suddenly reached out and grabbed her wrist.

Nina was startled and looked up at him.

They stared at each other in silence for a moment.

Richard teased. "First time?"

Nina blushed with embarrassment. She retorted, "You know it's not my first time."

"Then why are you acting like it is?" Richard studied her expression with interest.

Nina turned her face away. "I'm not used to being with strangers."

Richard chuckled, his hand slipping under the blanket. "You'll get used to it after a few times."

A surge of electricity seemed to run through Nina's body, making her tense up from Richard's touch. She had only intended to complete a task. After her last disgusting marriage, she had lost all interest in sex, and the thought of it made her fearful and repulsed.

But Richard was incredibly patient, guiding her step by step until they both reached the peak of pleasure.

Emily dialed Emma's number. As soon as the call connected, she trembled and said, "Emma, help me."

There was a long silence on the other end, followed by a deep male voice. "Useless!"

Emily's body jolted as she forced herself to speak through gritted teeth, "Charles, Richard brought them in. Leo and I got played! Charles, I'm in so much pain, it feels like I'm burning alive. Help me!"

The call was abruptly cut off.

Emily stared at her phone, despair washing over her.

The drug's effects were too intense. Even after soaking in cold water for over an hour, she felt no relief. Her mind was consumed by thoughts of men!

She needed to find a man to relieve the drug's effects!

Stumbling out of her room, Emily staggered into the elevator. She numbly pressed the button for the basement. When the doors slid open, she stumbled out, colliding with someone.

The scent of male hormones hit her, almost driving her crazy. She didn't even have time to see who it was before she pounced on him like a hungry wolf.

Emily started tearing at the man's clothes, twisting her body against him.

But the man in front of her stood still like a statue.

Emily couldn't help but look up, squinting to see the man.

It was Kevin!

Startled, she stumbled back and crashed into the wall.

Kevin took deliberate steps toward her, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Well, well, if it isn't the future Mrs. Landon. What's the matter? Is Mr. Landon not enough for you? Out looking for a man in the middle of the night?"

Emily shivered violently. She said nothing and turned to run.

But the next second, her scalp tightened, and a sharp pain hit her.

Kevin grabbed Emily's neck with one hand and her hair with the other, pinning her against the wall.Â "Slut! I've almost worn you out, and you still think Sebastian will want you? You actually dare to conspire with Leo and betray the Anderson family? You must be looking for trouble!"

Emily couldn't breathe, her mouth open, eyes wide, with a hint of defiance.

Kevin looked at her and sneered coldly. Suddenly, he let go, grabbed her arm, shoved her into the car, and drove off.

The next morning, Isabella woke up in Sebastian's arms.

Sebastian was already awake, his blind eyes staring blankly at her. One of his hands was under Isabella's head, and the other gently stroked her hair. His movements were light and gentle, as if afraid to wake her.

Isabella stared at Sebastian for a long time.

They had both been exhausted lately. Sebastian, in particular, had become noticeably haggard; the once confident and spirited man now appeared heartbreakingly worn out.

Isabella suddenly leaned in and kissed him.

Sebastian stiffened, then rolled over to pin her down. "How long have you been awake?"

"A while," Isabella replied.

"Spying on me?" Sebastian asked.

Isabella said nothing.

Sebastian couldn't see her expression, so he touched her face with his hand, his thumb brushing her lips repeatedly."And stealing kisses."

As he finished speaking, he felt another wet kiss on his lips.

Isabella kissed him again.

Emotions churned in Sebastian's chest. He lowered his head and kissed Isabella deeply.

They had made love for a long time last night, but it clearly wasn't enough.

After an indeterminate amount of time, there was a knock on the door.

Jack stood outside. "Mr. Landon, there's been an incident."

"Today, Mr. Landon announced the official launch of the Northhaven project. In an interview with the media, Mr. Landon stated that he plans to invest heavily in building an estate on this land and that he will name it after Mrs. Landon. He also mentioned that parts of the estate will be open to the public for visiting and sightseeing. Notably, we managed to capture a front view of the statue Mr. Landon commissioned for Mrs. Landon."

As the reporter spoke, the TV screen showed a statue.

Isabella watched intently. The statue bore no resemblance to Emma, though it did share some features with Sebastian.

She turned to look at Sebastian, only to find his expression had already changed.

"Sebastian?" Isabella squeezed his hand.

Sebastian turned his head. "I can't see. Bella, tell me, does the statue look like Emma?"

"No."

Sebastian's lips were drawn tight, and anger surged across his face.

Isabella turned off the TV. "Then who is the statue of?"

A trace of pain crossed Sebastian's face. "It's my mother."

Isabella was stunned.

Though she had anticipated something of this nature, the revelation still shocked her. More than that, it puzzled her. "Charles was supposed to be giving the estate to Emma. Why use a statue of Anna?"

Sebastian gritted his teeth. "He wants to curse my mother!

"Bella, my mother is buried under that land!" Sebastian covered his face with his hands, trying to hold back, but his shoulders still trembled uncontrollably.

Isabella had initially thought it was just a plot of land!

But now, she realized there was a deeper significance.

No wonder Sebastian had insisted on visiting that land personally. Isabella had been puzzled at the time. After all, it was a desolate place, far from the bustling city. If he were planning a project, he wouldn't need to make the trip himself.

It turned out Sebastian was going to see Anna!

And it made sense why Charles would go to such lengths to take the land. It wasn't just about the land-it was about seizing Anna's spirit and robbing Sebastian of his hopes and memories!

Charles had dealt a ruthless blow.

###chapter 235 He Needs You

This was the first time Isabella heard Sebastian mention his mother.

Anna. Just hearing the name, Isabella could tell she was a beautiful person.

Sebastian said, "Since I can remember, my parents' relationship was always strained. Why it was bad, I never knew. I remember my mom always loved to sunbathe, tending to her flowers and plants in the yard. She adored gardening and would excitedly show me whenever she cultivated a new variety. My dad, on the other hand, was always buried in work, cold and indifferent to my mom-and to me, too. It was like we were living under the same roof as the closest strangers.

"Then my mom fell ill. She was bedridden most of the time, and her beloved plants began to wither away. One day, I came home to hear them arguing. I found my dad smashing a cup and strangling my mom. I didn't think-I just rushed in, hitting my dad with all my might, trying to pull him off her.

"But I was too small then, and my strength was insignificant. Charles threw me aside and pressed his knee into my mom's stomach, hitting her repeatedly, saying something about a bastard child.

"It was only later that I found out my mom was pregnant at that time.

"My mom had a miscarriage. The doctors tried for a long time but couldn't save her. As she lay dying, Charles stood by the bed, promising to keep her photo displayed in the house. I thought he'd actually do it, but in reality, my mom didn't even get a decent funeral. He had her buried quietly.

"It was a stormy day. I rushed into his room and found him having sex with Emma."

Choking with emotion, Sebastian found himself overwhelmed by memories. Though many years had passed, he still lacked the courage to face them with equanimity.

Isabella hugged him, feeling suffocated as well. She patted his back, her eyes red. "Stop saying."

Sebastian held her hand, as if finding a bit of strength. "All these years, I've been looking for my mom's burial site. Charles was too thorough; there was no way to find it. I studied hard, started a business, and finally made a place for myself in Lakina. Everything I've done all these years was to find my mother's grave.

"About half a year ago, I finally found it. When I got there, I found it was just a wasteland, full of weeds, even without a grave." Sebastian cried uncontrollably, like a child.

Isabella could feel Sebastian's helplessness, her heart aching as well. But at this moment, any words of comfort were insignificant. Because she couldn't share Sebastian's pain and torment; all she could do was accompany him.

"I finally got an opportunity and spent a lot of money to buy that land. I was always conflicted about whether to dig up the ground to find my mother's remains. She's already gone; I didn't want to disturb her again. So I thought of protecting that land, planting flowers and plants there, giving her a beautiful garden. But before I could do it, a series of events happened."

Isabella felt a deep sense of guilt. If it weren't for her, Sebastian wouldn't have lost his way and become so disoriented. Charles wouldn't have had the chance to take that land from Sebastian!

"Bella, Bella." Sebastian hugged her.

Isabella looked at him, secretly making a decision in her heart!

The incident with the sculpture had deeply affected Sebastian, causing his emotions to fluctuate greatly. Isabella, worried about his health, had Marvin come over to give him a sedative. After Sebastian fell asleep, she quietly closed the door and came out.

Jack was standing outside. Seeing her come out, he immediately approached. "Is Mr. Landon okay?"

Isabella shook her head. "Not really."

Jack nodded solemnly. "Given what's happened, it's no surprise. It's on me too-I'm limited in what I can do, and I couldn't stop Charles."

Isabella looked at him. "Is there any way to get that land back?"

Jack fell silent.

Isabella sensed something, urgently asking, "There is a way, right? Jack, tell me, is there any way to get that land back?"

Jack shook his head. "No way, unless we get evidence about Charles' crimes and prove that he took the land illegally."

"There must be!" Isabella said firmly, "If he did it, there will be evidence!"

Seeing her determination, Jack reminded her, "You shouldn't get involved in this. When Mr. Landon's eyes are healed, he will have a way to deal with Charles. Isabella, you and Mr. Landon have come a long way; just stay with him during this time. He needs you!"

"I will," Isabella said, "I need him too!"

As they were talking, a subordinate ran over. "Mr. Brown, Leo has passed out."

Isabella was shocked. "Leo?"

She hadn't seen Leo since the hot springs last night. She knew Richard and Zaire had arranged everything, so she didn't worry.

Isabella followed Jack and saw Leo being carried out on a soft stretcher. His eyes were closed, and his hands and face were injured.

The subordinate, who had been watching Leo all night, said, "Last night, he was self-harming all night. He destroyed everything in the room. This morning, he finally quieted down. We were worried he might die, so we opened the door and found him unconscious."

Self-harming all night didn't seem like something Leo would do, but the wounds on his face were quite shocking to Isabella.

Jack glanced at Isabella, then told the subordinate, "Have Marvin check him out. If there are no major issues, send him back to the Anderson family."

"Yes."

As the subordinate was about to take Leo away, Isabella suddenly spoke, "Wait!"

She hesitated for a moment, then walked towards Leo.

Jack's heart tightened. "Isabella."

Isabella paused and turned back."Jack, you said that if we get evidence of Charles's crimes, we can get that land back, right?"

Jack was silent.

"Besides Charles, who else could have evidence of his crimes?" Isabella asked.

Jack remained silent.

Besides Charles, only Emma and Leo might have it.

Jack thought, 'But Leo and the Landon family are on the same side now. How could he possibly help Isabella find evidence?'

"I want to try." Isabella said.

A flicker of inner turmoil passed through Jack's eyes. "But if Mr. Landon finds out..."

"Then don't let him know!" Isabella said, "Find a room and wake Leo up. I'll talk to him."

Jack thought for a moment. Since Springfield Hot Springs was now under their control, as long as Isabella stayed within his sight, there shouldn't be any trouble. So he agreed.

###chapter 236 Break Down

They found a room and had Marvin examine Leo. Marvin said that the injuries were minor. As for the wounds on Leo's face and hands, they had been tended to as well.

When Leo opened his eyes, Isabella was standing by the bed, looking at him.

After a couple of seconds, Leo suddenly sat up and tried to grab Isabella, but she reacted faster and dodged his grasp.

"Bella." Leo frowned, his expression pained. He raised his hand to touch the wound on his face, recalling the events of the previous night, and his frown deepened.

Isabella stood at a distance, watching him. "Why did you self-harm?"

It took Leo a long moment to lower his hand. "I have claustrophobia."

Isabella was skeptical of his words.

Seeing her expression, Leo gave a self-mocking smile. "When I was a kid, Kevin used to lock me in a dark room. There was no light at all. Even the windows were nailed shut. Bella, have you ever experienced that kind of despair?"

Leo clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. "Being alone in that darkness, you can't see anything, but it feels like countless eyes are watching you. There's no sound, but it feels like many people are chattering noisily, yet you can't make out a single word. Bella, I was so scared."

Isabella was silent for a few seconds and then said, "But last night, they just locked you in a room. There were doors, windows, and light. It wasn't a claustrophobic space."

In short, even if Leo really had claustrophobia, it wouldn't have been triggered by the situation last night.

Leo was stunned. Then he laughed helplessly. "Bella, you're too smart. It's really hard to gain your sympathy."

Isabella was a bit speechless. "It's not that I'm smart; it's that your lie is too clumsy."

Leo lay back down on the bed, his gaze calmly fixed on Isabella's face."You were with Sebastian last night. You were together all night."

Isabella didn't respond.

Leo laughed again. "Looks like we won't be getting married."

"I never intended to marry you from the beginning. You should know that." Isabella said.

"But I was serious," Leo said softly, then gave a bitter smile. "Isabella, why does God always treat me this way? Why is it that the things I desperately strive for always remain out of my reach?"

Leo's gaze was direct, but Isabella's heart remained unmoved.

"Do you want to know the answer?" Isabella asked.

Leo nodded lightly.

"Because they harbor evil intentions," Isabella said as she walked over to the window, pulling back the curtains to let in the light from outside. "Nina told me that. When I was a kid, I stole something, and Nina found out. She smacked my palms with a ruler until they were swollen. That's when she told me that people who harbor evil intentions can never stand tall. Even if they manage to get something through dirty means, they're bound to face backlash sooner or later. So whatever you think you've gained is just temporary; in the end, it won't really belong to you."

Leo laughed softly. "That story is kind of funny."

Isabella looked at him.

After he had laughed enough, Isabella spoke, "Leo, cooperate with me."

Leo remained silent.

Isabella walked to the foot of the bed, looking directly into his eyes. "Help me get evidence of Charles' crimes. When I find Sweetie, I won't hold you accountable for what you've done before."

Leo's eyes wavered. "You want me to bring down Charles, help you find Sweetie, and then watch you reunite with your family? Isabella, why do you think I would help you?"

Isabella said, "Because of how I feel about you.

"The first time I met you, I knew you weren't a bad person."

Leo froze. He lowered his eyes and was at a loss for words.

Isabella's voice softened. "Leo, although I don't know what you've been through in the Anderson family, I believe you still have conscience. If you're willing to help me..."

"Don't even think about it." Leo suddenly interrupted Isabella, "Isabella, I won't help you!"

Isabella wanted to say something, but he interrupted her again, "Everything I have now was given by Charles. Although sometimes I find his methods despicable, I'm on his side now. If he is overthrown, my good days will be over too. So, Isabella, I won't help you!"

The wedding was canceled.

Although the gossip about Isabella and Sebastian was kept under wraps, the paparazzi managed to capture and leak images of Leo at his door. Now, news about Leo and Emily's pre-marital affair was everywhere.

Sebastian had people scouring the entire city for Sweetie, and Zaire and Richard were putting in every effort to help, but there were no leads.

Isabella's sleep quality deteriorated rapidly; Sweetie had become her constant torment. She would often wake up in the middle of the night, hearing Sweetie's cries in her ears, only to sit huddled with her knees drawn to her chest until dawn.

Within a week, Isabella fell ill.

After a brief fainting spell, Isabella woke up to see Marvin drawing several vials of blood from her. Sebastian stood nearby, gripping his cane tightly, his expression anxious. "How is she?"

Marvin was about to speak when he noticed Isabella had woken up. "You two talk. I'll go run some tests."

With that, he left.

Sebastian stumbled clumsily towards the bedside, touched Isabella's fingers, and immediately held them tightly. "Bella?"

Sebastian adapted quickly. Although he had only been blind for a little over a month, he no longer stumbled around. Isabella's heart ached as she responded, "Yes."

"How do you feel now? Is there anywhere that feels uncomfortable?" Sebastian was full of tension, frustrated that he couldn't see Isabella's current state.

"I'm fine," Isabella reassured him, "I just feel a bit uncomfortable from sleeping too long. I want to sit up."

"I'll help you." Sebastian fumbled to help Isabella sit up and placed a pillow behind her back. But as he withdrew his hand, he accidentally knocked over a water cup on the bedside table.

The water spilled everywhere. In his panic, Sebastian lunged for it, but his sudden movement sent the glass crashing to the floor instead.

The sound of breaking porcelain echoed in the bedroom.

Sebastian froze, his expression dejected.

"It's okay, " Isabella quickly comforted him.

Sebastian bent down to clean up the mess, but his fingers grazed the sharp edge of the broken glass, cutting a deep gash into his skin. Blood began to pour out.

"Sebastian!" Isabella, forgetting about herself, grabbed his arm and used several tissues to stop the bleeding.

But the tissues couldn't stop the blood, and they quickly became soaked with bright red.

Sebastian remained silent.

The atmosphere in the room thickened with an unspoken tension. The only sound was the rustle of Isabella's frantic tissue pulling.

Her gaze fell on the blood-soaked tissues, and all the emotions she had been holding back finally erupted.

###chapter 237 Crying for Forty Minutes

Perhaps the weight of these days had been too stifling, and once the dam broke, it came with a vengeance that was hard to contain.

At first, Isabella just shed tears in silence.

She didn't want her emotions to affect Sebastian.

But emotions were like a demon, clawing at Isabella and tearing her apart. Even though she bit her lips until they bled, she couldn't stop the cries or the trembling of her body.

Sebastian reached out and held Isabella in his arms, saying in a deep voice, "I'm sorry, Bella. It's my fault."

Hearing this, Isabella felt a sharp pain in her heart, as if something was stuck in her throat. She was at a loss for words, only shaking her head desperately.

"Go ahead and cry. Let it all out." Sebastian held her tightly. "You've been through so much lately. Crying will make you feel better."

So, Isabella cried for a full forty minutes.

Even after she stopped, she continued to sob for a long time.

After venting, Isabella felt completely drained. Her limbs were cold and numb, and her mind was blank.

She leaned weakly against Sebastian, listening to the heartbeat from his chest, and gradually calmed down.

After a long time, Sebastian's voice came from above her head. "Bella, what if we can't find Sweetie?"

Isabella's heart sank, and Sweetie's soft and adorable image flashed in her mind. In fact, they had almost searched for Lakina thoroughly these days. If Sweetie were still here, they would have found her by now. The more they couldn't find her, the more it indicated that hope was slim. It was very likely that Samantha had already taken Sweetie away from Lakina.

Isabella closed her eyes, a touch of despair washing over her face.

Sebastian's palm brushed over her head."Bella, let's call the police!"

Isabella opened her eyes."Will calling the police help? Your people, Richard's people and Zaire's people, have been searching for so long without any clues. Calling the police will only alert Charles. If we push him too hard, he might harm Sweetie. We can't call the police, absolutely not!"

Sebastian pressed his lips together. "Okay, we won't call the police."

The bleeding on his hand had stopped, but the bloodstains on the bedsheet were still shocking.

Isabella glanced at the broken porcelain on the floor and said, "Sebastian, let's find some time to go to the hospital and check your eyes."

Isabella had indeed been too depressed lately, her mind preoccupied with Sweetie, neglecting Sebastian. Sebastian, like her, was only concerned about her and Sweetie, not caring at all about his own eyes.

After a good cry, Isabella's mind became clear.

She knew she had to find Sweetie, retrieve what was hers, and get Sebastian's eyes treated. These tasks, one by one, needed to be tackled; it was better than continuing in this dismal state, which only handed Charles an advantage.

If she and Sebastian fell, even if they found Sweetie in the future, they would only become a burden to her.

Isabella pulled her hand away. "I'm going to wash my face and then go downstairs to eat."

Looking at her reflection in the mirror, Isabella almost didn't recognize herself. Afraid that Sebastian would be anxious from waiting, she quickly washed her face and came out.

Sebastian was sitting on the bed waiting for her. Isabella walked over. As soon as she grabbed his hand, Sebastian immediately held it tightly. "All done?"

"Yes." Isabella nodded, leading him downstairs.

In the afternoon, Isabella accompanied Sebastian to the hospital.

This was the first time Sebastian had formally seen a doctor since he went blind.

The examination was quite complicated and took two hours. After Sebastian went in, Isabella waited outside.

On the nearby LCD screen, news about Emma's estate was playing, including footage of a sculpture. This time, the sculpture was shown in full, and Isabella noticed that it had no eyes, its hands were cut off, and it was bound with ropes. It was suffocating.

Isabella thought, 'Luckily! Sebastian can't see it, otherwise, he would be very upset.'

"Miss." A child's voice reached her ears.

Isabella was stunned for a moment, thinking she was hearing things.

Then, her fingers were gently tugged.

Isabella looked down and saw a little boy standing beside her.

"Miss, have you seen my mom?" The boy was delicate but very thin, with a pale face, clearly sick.

Isabella used to have no feelings for children. But since having Sweetie, she had grown very fond of them.

She squatted down to his level and asked gently, "Did you get separated from your mom?"

The boy nodded. "I think so."

The hospital was crowded, and Isabella worried about the boy's safety. Thinking Sebastian would take a while, she held the boy's hand and took him to find his mom.

As they reached the first floor, they heard a woman crying and asking the nurse at the reception desk for help, "Please, you have to help me find my son. I just went to pay a bill, but when I turned around, he was gone. He's sick. What if a bad person took him?"

Isabella's hand was suddenly empty as the boy ran towards the woman. "Mom!"

The boy threw himself into the woman's arms, and she was overjoyed when she saw her son.

The boy's mother showed gratitude to Isabella.

Isabella said, "It was nothing. Just make sure to keep a close eye on him from now on."

"Yes, I won't let him out of my sight again." The woman thanked her repeatedly before leaving with the boy.

Isabella stood there, feeling as though she were the sole person in the vast expanse of the world.

The nurse at the reception desk saw her standing there for a long time and came over to ask, "Miss, are you okay?"

Isabella managed a wry smile, shaking her head as she prepared to leave. Suddenly, a gurney was pushed into the room. It sped past her, followed closely by two police officers.

Isabella glanced at the stretcher but didn't see who was on it. However, the woman who followed themÂ made her freeze.

It was Emma!

Emma, tears streaming down her face, sprinted after the gurney, barely acknowledging Isabella as she rushed by.

Isabella hesitated for a moment, recalling Emma's appearance and wondering if the person on the stretcher was Charles.

She thought, 'Did something happen to Charles?'

A shiver ran down Isabella's spine. Without thinking, she followed.

Outside the emergency room, Emma was stopped.

"Family members must wait outside."

Watching the door close, Emma staggered back a few steps, sobbing.

Emma stood for a moment, her legs weak. She turned to find a seat and saw Isabella.

###chapter 238 A Condition

Emma was taken aback for a moment. "Isabella, what are you doing here?"

Isabella walked over and glanced at the light above the emergency room door. "Who's in there?"

She wasn't worried about Charles; she was worried about Sweetie. Now that Sweetie was controlled by Charles, if something really happened to Charles, it would be even harder to find Sweetie.

Emma didn't answer; instead, she started crying, lowering her head and wiping her tears incessantly.

Seeing this, Isabella felt a tightness in her chest. "Mrs. Landon, is Charles in there? What happened to him? Where's my daughter?"

Footsteps approached from behind, followed by a strong male voice. "I didn't know Isabella cared so much about my life. "

Hearing this voice, Isabella was startled.

She turned around to see Charles and Leo walking over, confused.

She thought, 'Charles is standing there just fine, so who is the person that has been taken in earlier?'

At this moment, the emergency room door opened, and a nurse hurried out, asking, "Who are the patient's parents?"

Emma immediately stood up and walked over. "I'm his mother."

Charles also walked over. "How is my son?"

"It's not looking good. He attempted suicide by swallowing nails and has completely given up on living. The situation is extremely critical. If his parents can go in and talk to him, try to encourage him, there might be a slim chance to reach him. Could you tell me if he was closer to his father or his mother?"

Emma and Charles both fell silent.

The nurse urged, "You both should come in with me."

Charles was about to go in but was pulled back by Emma.

"Wait!" Emma said.

Charles looked at her. "What's wrong?"

"Wait, wait." Emma kept repeating, yet she never disclosed the reason.

Charles urged, "What are you waiting for? Matthew is on the brink of death!"

Saying this, he pulled Emma's hand away and was about to go in.

"Wait!" Emma shouted, throwing herself at Charles and hugging him, her voice trembling. "No, don't hurt Matthew. Don't!"

Isabella was taken aback, or rather, she was frightened. Emma's reaction was a bit too extreme.

Even though Isabella knew the Landon family's relationships weren't as harmonious as they appeared, Emma's actions seemed to suggest that Charles going in wasn't to save Matthew but to harm him. Emma's fear and trepidation seemed far from an act.

Charles was annoyed, prying Emma's fingers off forcefully. "I think you're confused. Matthew is my only son; how could I harm him? I'm going in to save him!"

Leo also walked over. "Yes, Emma, Matthew's condition is critical. You should go in with Charles and see him!"

They were all urging her, but Emma still clung to Charles' clothes, not letting go.

Charles was really annoyed, his eyes suddenly turning cold.

Emma struggled for a while, then suddenly turned to see Isabella. Her eyes lit up. "Isabella, let Isabella go!"

Charles and Leo remained silent, but both of their gazes fell on Isabella.

Emma let go of Charles' clothes and turned to walk over to Isabella.

Before Isabella could speak, Emma dropped to her knees. "Bella, only you can save Matthew now."

Isabella took a step back, but Emma grabbed her arm. "At this point, I don't care if you think I'm ridiculous. Ever since Matthew was sent to prison, he's refused to see us. I know he hates us. Bella, you know our situation-if Matthew really cared about me and Charles, he wouldn't have tried to kill himself by swallowing nails. He's left no way out for himself or for us. If we go in now, it's like sending him to his death. Bella, maybe only you have a chance of reaching him. I'm begging you, give Matthew a chance to live!"

Emma was sobbing uncontrollably, her cries echoing in the hallway.

Charles said nothing, but his face was tense as he was also waiting for Isabella's answer.

For Isabella, this was a good opportunity.

"I have one condition."

Charles just stared coldly at Isabella.

Emma first looked at Charles, but he didn't look at her.

They all knew what Isabella's condition was.

At this moment, a doctor came over to urge, "Are you ready? The patient is about to die. If this continues, we'll have to use the defibrillator."

"No, no defibrillator!" Emma cried out, "Isabella, I'll agree to anything you want. Please save Matthew!"

Isabella had been waiting for Emma to say this. " I just want my child. Emma, as a mother, I hope you don't inflict the pain of losing a child on me."

"Okay, okay!" Emma nodded repeatedly. "As long as Matthew survives, I'll give your child back!"

Isabella pursed her lips but looked at Charles.

She knew that Emma's words didn't count; she had to force Charles to agree.

Probably also feeling sorry for Matthew, after a long while, Charles nodded. "I agree!"

Isabella said, "When I come out, I want to see my child. If you go back on your word, I can save Matthew today, and I can send him to his death tomorrow."

Charles's eyes tightened. "Don't worry. I will keep my word."

Only then did Isabella follow the medical staff into the emergency room.

Once the door closed, Emma stood up from the ground. "But Charles, where are we going to get a child to give her?"

Before she could finish, Charles shot her a look, and Emma immediately fell silent.

After staring at Emma for a moment, Charles turned his gaze to the tightly closed emergency room door. "I just want my child to live. As for her child..."

Charles didn't continue. But Leo and Emma understood the unspoken message. Not to mention that Isabella's child, Sweetie, had been lost; even if Sweetie was still around, Charles wouldn't hand her over so easily. That child was their only leverage against Sebastian, their trump card to control him!

Leo furrowed his brow and said, "If Isabella doesn't see the child when she comes out, I'm afraid she won't let things go easily. If Matthew really listens to her, she could truly hold the key to his life and death."

"Yes." Charles sighed, somewhat self-mockingly, "I never thought I would have such a lovesick son!"

Saying this, he glared fiercely at Emma.

Emma avoided his gaze.

Charles turned to Leo and said, "Find out why Isabella came to the hospital today. I don't believe she would show up here for no reason."

"No need to check. I know." Leo replied, "She came with Sebastian to get his eyes checked."

Charles looked at him in surprise. "You had someone follow her?"

Leo didn't deny it, saying, "I understand what you want to do. I'll make arrangements right away."

Charles nodded, and Leo turned to leave.

Emma wiped away her tears and glanced in the direction Leo had left."You've trained Leo well. He's smart and capable."

Charles sneered with disdain. "Just a lapdog I've temporarily raised."

After saying this, he looked at Emma, coldly questioning, "Why did you stop me from going in just now?"

Emma stiffened all over.

###chapter 239 Hell

"No." Emma lowered her eyelids. "I'm just worried that Matthew doesn't want to see us, afraid he might do something rash. I didn't mean to stop you from going in."

"Really?" Charles continued to stare at her.

Before entering the emergency room, Isabella was taken to a prep room where she donned a sterile gown, cap, and gloves.

The emergency room was frigid, and the lighting was as stark and white as fresh snow.

Matthew lay under that harsh, white light, his upper body bare, covered in tubes. His face was stained with a brownish mess, making it hard to tell if it was blood or disinfectant.

Next to him, on a medical tray, was a short nail, gruesomely coated in flesh and blood, emitting a putrid, decayed smell.

The doctors were doing their best to save Matthew. As Isabella stepped in, she heard someone exclaim, "The patient's heart has stopped!"

Then, a piercing sound came from the machine.

"Prepare for defibrillation!"

"Is the family here?"

"She is here." Someone pushed Isabella forward.

Isabella took two steps forward, watching as the defibrillator was pressed onto Matthew's chest.

She saw Matthew's lifeless body jerk up like a puppet, his frail body shaking uncontrollably before falling back down heavily.

The line on the heart monitor was straight.

Isabella was stunned, completely terrified by the scene.

At this moment, a young doctor turned to her and asked, "So young, are you the patient's mother?"

Isabella shook her head. "No, I'm not."

"Then you are the patient's..."

"Friend." Isabella squeezed out the words.

She thought, 'Matthew and I can barely be considered friends, right?'

The doctor frowned. "Give me your hand."

Isabella hesitantly complied.

The doctor grabbed her wrist, pulling her closer, placing her hand on Matthew's.

The cold touch made Isabella instinctively want to pull her hand back, but the doctor said, "Talk to him! Keep talking to him. The golden rescue period is within four minutes of cardiac arrest. After that, he can't be saved!"

With that, the doctor turned back to the defibrillator.

Isabella felt her arm go numb for a few seconds. As she gazed at Matthew's lifeless face, the image of her daughter Sweetie's innocent visage surfaced in her mind.

She thought, 'Matthew can't die! Matthew absolutely can't die!'

Isabella tightly gripped Matthew's hand, bending down slightly, and began to speak to him.

"Matthew, I am Isabella. Can you hear me?

"I don't care if you can hear me or not. I'm telling you, you are not allowed to die!

"Matthew, wake up! Do you hear me? You can't die! you can't die!"

Time passed second by second. Isabella had never felt that four minutes could be so long yet so short.

No matter how fervently she pleaded and regardless of the doctors' relentless efforts to resuscitate him, Matthew remained unresponsive while the sound from the heart monitor continued without pause.

Someone sighed, and the doctor pulled the defibrillator away.

Isabella turned around to see everyone looking at her and Matthew, a layer of invisible sadness enveloping the room.

She thought, 'Have they given up on the rescue?

'What about my Sweetie?'

A nurse came over and gently pulled Isabella. "Sorry, we've done our best."

"No!" Isabella broke free from the nurse's hand."He can't die! he can't die!"

Isabella turned back, shaking Matthew vigorously, her voice loud. "Matthew, wake up! Do you hear me!"

The doctors had seen too many scenes like this. They didn't pull Isabella away, silently watching, giving her space to vent.

Outside, Jack supported Sebastian as they walked over, hearing the cries from inside.

Jack paused, looking at Sebastian.

Sebastian was expressionless, but when Jack reached out to open the door, Sebastian suddenly raised his hand, stopping him.

"Mr. Landon?"

Sebastian silently shook his head.

Isabella's cries continued for two minutes, then gradually subsided.

She collapsed to the ground, thinking of Sweetie, her heart aching.

She thought, 'Why would God toy with me in such a cruel manner?! I have been so close to bringing Sweetie back home.'

Suddenly, the sound from the machine changed, no longer the monotonous long beep, but a rhythmic, regular beat.

Everyone froze for a few seconds.

"There's a heartbeat!"

"Quick, continue the rescue!"

Matthew didn't die.

Isabella pulled him back from the brink of hell.

After half an hour of resuscitation, Matthew finally clung to life.

Emma hugged Isabella, crying. "Thank you, Bella. The Landon family owes you a life!"

Isabella's eyes were red and swollen. She looked around and hoarsely asked, "Where's my daughter?"

"Someone has been sent to get her, it will take some time. Why don't you rest for a bit?" Emma said.

Isabella shook her head, pushing Emma away. "How long will it take?"

Charles said, "At most in two days. We've booked their tickets; you'll see her in two days."

Isabella nodded, finally feeling a weight lift off her heart. "Then I'll go back and wait. I hope you're not lying to me."

Isabella returned home to find Sebastian's car parked in the yard.

She got out of the taxi and entered the house.

As she changed her shoes at the door, Nina came out of the kitchen. "Bella, you're back?"

"Nina," Isabella called softly, walking over to gently hug Nina.

Nina was startled, still holding a spoon, and gently hugged her back. "What's wrong?"

"Nina," Isabella closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of Nina's embrace, just like when they were young and relied on each other. Every time she had trouble, Nina would hug her, giving her strength and warmth.Â 

"I'm so tired." Isabella said.

Nina patted her shoulder and said gently, "If you're tired, go rest. Take a nap. I'll make dinner for you."

"Okay." Isabella nodded and went upstairs.

Nina stood downstairs, watching Isabella's figure until it disappeared from view before turning and heading back to the kitchen.

The upstairs was eerily quiet. Isabella pushed open the bedroom door and found Sebastian sitting at the desk, bathed in the bluish glow of his computer screen.

She walked over and saw a jumble of documents on the screen, the text scrolling as he moved the mouse. Yet, his eyes seemed unable to focus on anything in particular.

"Sebastian?" Isabella sensed his agitation and softly asked, "Why didn't you wait for me after your check-up and came back first?"

As she spoke, she bent down to hug him.

When she touched Sebastian, she noticed him stiffen slightly, then heard his hoarse voice. "Where did you go?"

###chapter 240 Will You Leave?

Isabella's eyes flickered for a moment. She replied, "A little boy got lost, and I took him to find his mom. I didn't expect it to take so long. When I went back to look for you, I realized you were already gone."

"Really, two hours?" Sebastian's voice was calm and it was hard to discern any emotion.

"Yeah, the hospital is huge, and it took a while to get around." Isabella turned to look at his face. "What did the doctor say? How are we going to treat it?"

Sebastian pressed his lips together, his voice heavy."Bella, if I remain blind for the rest of my life, would you leave me?"

Isabella's heart ached at his words. She tightened her grip on his arm instinctively and said, "How could it not be cured? You were just blindedÂ  because of the explosion's flash. How could it not be cured?"

Sebastian was very calm. "But that's what the doctor said. The intense light damaged my cornea, and it's irreversible. It might never recover."

He held Isabella's hand. "Bella, I might be blind for the rest of my life."

"No way!" Isabella shook her head. She finally understood why Sebastian had been so agitated. He sat in front of the computer even though he couldn't see anything. Even she had a hard time accepting this fact, let alone Sebastian.

Isabella cupped Sebastian's face and leaned in to kiss him gently. "If Lakina cannot provide a cure, then we shall seek treatment elsewhere. If it can't be cured in the country, we'll go abroad. Today's technology is advanced. I saw on TV that even people born blind can regain their sight. You definitely can too!"

"What if we see all the top doctors and still can't fix it?" Sebastian was persistent about this topic. "Will you leave me?"

Isabella was stunned.

During the days of Sebastian's blindness, she had never thought about this question. She always believed that Sebastian's condition was not serious and that with active treatment, it would surely be cured.

She thought, 'But what if it really can't be cured? I can be Sebastian's eyes, but can Sebastian himself accept this reality?'

Isabella's silence lasted only a few seconds, but for Sebastian, it felt like a heavy blow.

He let go of her hand and smiled bitterly. "I understand."

Isabella looked at him, grieved.

"I can understand, actually." Sebastian's voice echoed faintly in the room.

Isabella felt that Sebastian hadn't finished speaking, but after waiting for a long time, he said nothing more.

"Sebastian." Isabella wanted to say something.

But Sebastian interrupted her, "I need to get busy. Can you not disturb me?"

Isabella looked at Sebastian and then at the lit computer screen.

Sebastian was clearly blind and would never see anything, no matter how long he stayed there. Since losing his sight, Sebastian had handed over nearly all company affairs to Jack and Zaire. Except for major issues, the smaller matters didn't require his direct involvement.

Claiming to be busy was just an excuse; Sebastian was trying to push her away.

His stern face seemed to be cloaked in a thin layer of frost, and Isabella could even detect a hint of impatience in his expression.

She felt a knot in her chest and nodded stiffly. "Okay."

Then Isabella went to the bathroom.

Closing the door, Isabella leaned against it and slid down to the floor.

She didn't know what Sebastian had gone through today, but she was certain he must be feeling wretched now.

Isabella really could understand him. So if Sebastian wanted to be alone, she would give him space. But she didn't know why she still felt so miserable.

Isabella hadn't told Sebastian about Matthew, not wanting to add to his troubles. Besides, they were now at odds with the Landon family, and with the issue of Anna's sculpture, if Sebastian knew she had helped Matthew, discord may arise between them.

Isabella was only waiting for Sweetie to come back in two days. Once that happened, everything would fall into place.

She could explain everything to Sebastian then, and she hoped he wouldn't hold a grudge.

She also believed that Sweetie's return would help Sebastian regain his strength. Treatment required the patient's active participation-just like how Matthew's heart had stopped in the emergency room, but he was eventually saved.

Anything was possible.

Isabella wiped away her tears, washed her face, and felt a bit better. When she came out of the bathroom, she found that Sebastian was no longer in the bedroom.

The sound of a car engine came from downstairs. Isabella walked to the window and saw a car leaving the yard.

She went downstairs, and Nina was setting the table. "Bella, did something happen? Sebastian didn't look good when he left."

Isabella suppressed her emotions and asked, "Did Jack pick him up?"

"Yes." Nina replied.

"Probably he needs to deal with something at the company." Isabella pulled out a chair and sat down, eating absentmindedly.

Nina sat beside her, looking serious. "Did you two have a fight?"

"No." Isabella's voice was muffled. "I went to the hospital with him today to get his eyes checked. The doctor said his eyes might not be curable."

" I had thought you two had a fight." Nina sighed in relief upon hearing the reason. Seeing Isabella so exhausted, Nina held Isabella's hand and comforted her, "Bella, you and Sebastian have been through so much to get here. At this point, you two must stick together. Whatever happens, you must talk it out. The most important thing between a couple is honesty."

Isabella's eyes flickered. "I understand."

"I'll put the food in the oven. If Sebastian comes back and you want to eat, just heat it up." Nina cleaned up the kitchen before leaving.

Isabella saw her out. It was completely dark outside, and the streetlights were on.

"Do you need me to drive you?" Isabella asked.

"No, Richard will pick me up." Nina replied.

As Nina finished speaking, Richard's car arrived. It stopped at the steps, and Richard got out, naturally putting his arm around Nina's waist. "Ready to go?"

Nina, feeling a bit uncomfortable, pulled away slightly. She turned to give Isabella a few reminders before getting in the car and leaving.

Isabella noticed that Nina was no longer as reserved in Richard's presence as she used to be. Nina seemed much more at ease compared to how she was around Charlie. It seemed Richard treated Nina well, and after everything Nina had been through, Richard was a decent choice.

Isabella stood at the door for a moment before closing it and going back inside.

The villa was empty, with only Isabella left. She sat on the sofa and picked up her phone to call Sebastian.

When the call connected, a woman's voice answered on the other end.

###chapter 241 Don't Mention It

"Hey, is this Isabella?"

Hearing this voice, Isabella was momentarily stunned.

Seeing that she didn't respond, the person on the other end quickly said, "It's me, Laura. Don't you remember me?"

Isabella snapped back to reality. "I remember."

It was just that she hadn't been to the Landon Group for so long that everything from the past seemed like a distant memory.

"Mr. Landon is at a social event. He left his phone in the room, and I was just about to bring it to him when you called. Don't worry! I'll get it to him right away." Footsteps were heard from the other end, and a few minutes later, the phone was handed to someone else. Isabella also heard Laura say, "Mr. Landon, it's Isabella on the phone."

Isabella was about to speak, but the call was abruptly ended.

The busy signal buzzed in Isabella's ears, making her brain tingle.

She didn't bother calling back and instead sat on the couch, clutching her phone, waiting.

When one was alone, time seemed to slow down. Isabella found herself lost in memories, and before she knew it, she had drifted off on the couch.

She was jolted awake by a dull thud. Rubbing her eyes, she heard the door open and footsteps. After a brief moment of confusion, she hurried to the door. "Sebastian?"

Jack was helping Sebastian inside, and the strong smell of alcohol hit Isabella like a wave. For a moment, she was taken aback, but then she bent down to fetch slippers and put them on Sebastian herself. She followed Jack up the stairs.

Jack set Sebastian down on the bed and straightened up. Seeing Isabella, he explained, "Mr. Landon insisted on a night out with some clients. He drank until now and is completely plastered."

"Why did he drink so much?" Isabella asked.

Sebastian was usually very disciplined. Even at social events, he rarely got so drunk he needed help.

This was the first time she'd seen him so incapacitated that he couldn't move without assistance.

Jack's expression grew serious. "Actually, this afternoon"

"Jack!" Sebastian's voice cut in, interrupting Jack. He sat up from the bed, rubbing his temples with a pained expression. "Help me to the bathroom."

"I'll help you." A soft hand reached out, holding his.

Sebastian stiffened, then pushed the hand away. "I don't need you. Jack!"

"Mr. Landon,"Â Jack stepped forward reluctantly, helping Sebastian to the bathroom.

Isabella, feeling out of place, stood still, unsure of what to do.

As the sounds of vomiting came from the bathroom, Isabella quietly slipped out of the room.

A few minutes later, Jack emerged from the bathroom, supporting Sebastian. Noticing Isabella's absence, Jack couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Landon, why haven't you told Isabella about our trip to the emergency room this afternoon?"

Sebastian, sitting weakly on the edge of the bed and grimacing from the headache, waved his hand dismissively. "Don't mention it!"

Jack was persistent. "Maybe Ms.Miller was tricked into going. Shouldn't you give her a chance to explain?"

"Even if she was tricked, was her reaction at the time fake?" Sebastian's voice was low, as if he was asking Jack, but more like he was asking himself.

Moreover, Isabella hadn't told him that after she came back.

Sebastian almost felt relieved he was blind; he couldn't bear to see Isabella's heart-wrenching anguish by Matthew's bedside. Just hearing her pain was too much; seeing it firsthand would have been unbearable.

Jack had no response to this.

He thought, 'Yes, if Isabella didn't care about Matthew at all, why would she cry so much when Matthew was on the brink of death?

'But if Isabella still has feelings for Matthew, then what does that make Sebastian?'

Isabella was carrying a bowl of soup when she ran into Jack at the staircase.

"How is he?" Isabella asked.

Jack glanced at the bowl in her hands, his emotions complicated. "Not too well."

After a pause, he asked, "Isabella, what are your feelings for Mr. Landon?"

Isabella was taken aback. "What do you mean?"

Jack frowned. "I'm not good with matters of the heart. But I've been with Mr. Landon for many years, I can tell that he is serious about you, and he won't settle for anyone else. Isabella, you mustn't betray or hurt him. Otherwise, even if Mr. Landon forgives you, I won't!"

Isabella couldn't comprehend a single word of what Jack said. She wanted to ask for clarification, but Jack left directly.

Isabella opened the bedroom door. Sebastian was still sitting on the bed, hunched over, holding his head with his hands.

"Sebastian, I made some soup." Isabella handed the bowl over.

"Get away!" Sebastian suddenly raised his hand, knocking the bowl over.

Isabella gasped as the soup spilled onto her hand, causing a sharp pain and making her eyes well up with tears.

Sebastian was stunned for a couple of seconds, then quickly stood up and reached out to her. "Bella, Bella, are you okay?"

Sebastian, already unsteady from the alcohol, stumbled and almost hit the corner of the cabinet.

Isabella, alarmed, reached out to steady him."Sebastian, I'm here."

The next second, she was pulled into Sebastian's embrace.

"Bella." Sebastian held her tightly, as if holding a precious lost item. His careful and restrained manner made his earlier coldness seem even more painful.

Isabella felt a tightness in her chest. "I'm fine, Sebastian."

They sat down by the bed, and Sebastian gently touched her hand. "Does it hurt?"

"Yes." Isabella nodded honestly.

Sebastian took out his phone to make a call, but Isabella stopped him. "What are you doing?"

"Calling Marvin to come and check your hand."

"No need,"Â Isabella said, both annoyed and amused. "It's just a minor burn. I'll apply some ointment myself."

Sebastian nodded. "Then I'll get the first aid kit."

As he got up, Isabella also stood up and took his hand. "I'll go with you."

Sebastian paused, then nodded.

They went downstairs and found the first aid kit. Isabella helped him open it, pulling out the burn cream and placing it in his hand. She then offered her hand, laying it in his palm.

Sebastian paused, then squeezed some cream onto her hand, applying it gently.

His touch was so light, as if he was afraid of causing her more pain. The room was silent except for the faint sound of the wind outside, and Isabella watched him intently, her eyes never leaving his face.

"All done,"Â Sebastian said, retracting the ointment and releasing her hand.

Isabella felt an emptiness when he let go, and she instinctively grabbed his hand, her voice urgent. "Sebastian, are you hiding something from me?"

###chapter 242 Driven to a Dead End

Sebastian's expression stiffened, and he pulled his hand back, his voice sounding rigid. "No."

He closed the ointment. "It's getting late. You should rest early."

With that, Sebastian got up and felt his way to the sofa, heading upstairs.

Isabella followed. "Let me help you up."

"No need!" Sebastian's reaction was intense. He brushed her hand away and said, "I have some things to take care of. I'll sleep in the study tonight. You don't have to wait for me."

"Sebastian!" Isabella called his name.

But Sebastian just quickened his pace and almost ran away.

Isabella sat downstairs for a moment, then took out her phone and dialed Zaire.

"Isabella, it's so late. What's up?" Zaire asked.

"Mr. Jose, has the Landon Group run into trouble?" Isabella said.

Zaire was silent for two seconds and then said, "Nothing major, what happened?"

Isabella glanced upstairs. Zaire's two-second pause had already explained everything. She thought 'If I guessed correctly, it must be Charles causing trouble again.'

"Sebastian went out for a social event tonight and drank too much. He's feeling really terrible now. Mr. Jose, I want to know what exactly happened." Isabella's tone was firm.

Zaire knew that even if he didn't tell Isabella, she would find out from Nina eventually.

"Charles poached a few of Sebastian's major clients again. Now, the media is now broadcasting that Sebastian's eyesight is beyond recovery. With Charles stirring things up, a few old shareholders sold their shares in the Landon Group behind Sebastian's back. Sebastian is worried that the other shareholders won't hold up, so he went there in a hurry."

"Sold shares?" Isabella gripped her phone tightly, her heart pounding. Although she wasn't versed in the intricacies of corporate management, she knew that if Charles went on a buying spree, it could spell disaster for the Landon Group.

She thought, 'Is Charles trying to completely sideline Sebastian, leaving him with nothing?'

"Charles is too much! This is pushing Sebastian to a dead end!" Isabella's eyes reddened with anger, and her nails dug into her palms.

Zaire said, "Don't worry. I'll keep a close eye on the Landon Group, and Richard will help too. Isabella, I know Sebastian. What he needs most right now is you. Just stay with him, and we'll handle the rest."

Isabella shook her head. "Mr. Jose, if any more shareholders secretly sell their shares, can you let me know?"

Zaire thought for a moment. They could only help for a while. If Sebastian really went blind, someone would have to manage the Landon Group in the future, and Isabella was the most suitable candidate.

"Okay." Zaire replied.

Isabella made another bowl of soup and brought it to Sebastian.

She didn't knock, just turned the doorknob and walked in. Sebastian was sitting in front of the computer, staring at the screen, lost in thought.

Isabella didn't call out to Sebastian. She walked over quietly and placed the soup on the table.

Throughout the process, she tried hard not to make any noise. Afraid of startling Sebastian, she left after putting down the soup.

Sebastian slightly turned his head. "Take it away!"

Isabella froze and turned back to look at him. "A hangover feels terrible. Drink some soup, and your head won't hurt as much tomorrow."

Sebastian pressed his lips together and said nothing more.

Isabella glanced at him and left.

As she closed the door behind her, Isabella stood outside, straining to hear any sounds from within.

Hearing the footsteps outside fade away, Sebastian finally moved. He reached out to the table, touched the bowl, and picked it up to drink the soup.

Back in her bedroom, Isabella tossed and turned all night.

When she finally fell asleep, she had a series of nightmares.

Suddenly, the mattress behind her sank slightly, and a familiar scent enveloped her. Isabella turned around and snuggled into Sebastian's arms. Sebastian stiffened slightly, then held her tightly.

In the latter half of the night, Isabella gradually slept soundly.

She slept until she woke up naturally. When Isabella opened her eyes, she reached out but grabbed nothing.

"Sebastian!" Isabella sat up in bed, only to realize she was alone. It was as if the warmth from last night had been merely a figment of her dreams.

Isabella slipped on her slippers, didn't wash up, and went straight to the study to find Sebastian.

The study was empty.

Isabella hurried downstairs, but the entire villa was deserted.

The doorbell suddenly rang.

Isabella ran to open the door."Sebastian."

Standing at the door, however, was Miley.

"What's going on?" Miley was startled by her reaction. She calmed down and said, "I saw Sebastian's car leaving when I came over."

"It's nothing." Isabella shook her head and let her in.

"I figured you hadn't eaten, so I brought you some breakfast." Miley opened the breakfast and placed it in front of her. "Have some?"

Isabella shook her head, pushing the breakfast aside. "I'm not hungry."

"You can't go on like this in the afternoon. You look dispirited." Miley sat down and held Isabella's hand. "Do you want to go out with me for a walk?"

Isabella couldn't muster any interest.

Just then, a car horn blared outside, briefly but unmistakably.

Isabella looked out the window.

Miley said, "Zaire said you wanted to learn business. He's waiting outside."

Isabella blinked. "What?"

It took a moment for the information to sink in. She shot up from the sofa. "I'll change and be right out."

Feeling a mix of excitement and nerves, Isabella hurried to the car. As they drove off, she asked Zaire, "Where are we going to learn about business?"

"We're heading to a bidding event,"Â Zaire replied. "It's a good opportunity to see how things work."

Isabella nodded. "Got it."

Zaire shot her a reassuring glance. "No need to be so anxious. Just relax."

"Okay,"Â Isabella said, though her nerves were still on edge.

Zaire added, "You'll likely run into a lot of familiar faces. The more tense you are, the less favorably you'll be seen."

"Right,"Â Isabella said, taking a deep breath to steady herself.

Miley linked arms with her. "Isabella, don't worry. I'm here with you."

"Thanks."

The bidding event was held in a large arena. The car wove through the sprawling grounds for quite some time before finally stopping in front of a gleaming white building.

As Zaire had predicted, they immediately ran into Leo. Dressed in a sharp black suit, his hair neatly styled, and with a noticeably sharp gaze, Leo was surrounded by a crowd. From a distance, he caught sight of Isabella and the others, offering a polite nod and smile before moving on.

Miley remarked, "Leo's really making waves these days."

"Let's go,"Â Zaire said.

They followed Zaire into the venue, where the crowd thickened as they went deeper. Isabella spotted many familiar faces among the bustling crowd.

###chapter 243 Wanting Everything

Some of them were top business moguls in Lakina, while others were shareholders and executives of the Landon Group.

Isabella had worked at the Landon Group for a while, and back then, those executives were respectful and polite to Sebastian. But now, they seemed to have broken free from the Landon Group, surrounding Leo and flattering him.

"Isabella," Leo suddenly called out to her, then walked over with those people.

Isabella stopped in her tracks, looking at him emotionlessly.

Leo held two glasses, handing her the one with orange juice. "Welcome to today's bidding meeting."

The people around Leo looked at Isabella with curious and probing eyes.

Seeing Isabella not taking the glass, they turned to Leo, and one of them asked, "Mr. Anderson, who is this?"

Leo smiled, stepped aside, and stood next to Isabella. "Let me introduce, Isabella."

"Isabella?"

"Who is she?"

"That name sounds familiar. I've heard it somewhere before?"

Leo smirked and said to a few middle-aged men, "This is your Mr. Landon's fiancÃ©e."

"No wonder the name sounded familiar. So it's Mrs. Landon. Nice to meet you."

"Is Mr. Landon not here today?"

"Mr. Landon has been unwell for quite some time now, stuck at home resting. You won't see him at events like this,"Â one of the attendees commented.

"True enough, but having a woman out here doesn't quite match Mr. Landon's usual style,"Â another chimed in.

"Mr. Landon's always been a gentleman. If it weren't a special circumstance, he wouldn't let Mrs. Landon show her face,"Â someone else added.

"Right? He's such a devoted man. The guy's a big shot, yet he's moping around over a woman, and now look what he's done to himself,"Â a man scoffed.

"What surprises me is that Mr. Landon entrusts his company to a woman who's not exactly a business whiz. Isn't that a bit reckless?"

The crowd buzzed with gossip, pointing fingers at Isabella.

Leo stood to the side, observing the scene with an amused glint in his eye.

Miley tried to pull Isabella away to find Zaire, but Isabella stood her ground.

Turning to Leo with a tentative smile, Isabella stepped aside, picked up a glass of wine, and returned to face the crowd. "First of all, just to clarify, Mr. Landon and I aren't married yet; we're still in the dating phase, so please don't call me Mrs. Landon just yet. Secondly, I'm not here on behalf of the Landon Group today; I'm representing myself. You all are associates of the Landon Group, even if some of you seem to have gone a bit wayward. But given that you still carry the Landon name, the things you just said can do some serious damage-to the Landon Group and to yourselves. It's in everyone's best interest to keep that in mind."

A few men responded with scornful looks, clearly unimpressed with her.

Not inclined to engage further, Isabella turned her attention back to Leo. "When I first met Mr. Anderson, he was just a struggling nobody, always seen with a different woman in his car. It's wild to see how far he's come now. Even though I'm not here on Mr. Landon's behalf, like Mr. Anderson said, I am Mr. Landon's fiancÃ©e, and everything I do reflects on him. So, to avoid any needless chatter that might land on his head, allow me to raise a glass to Mr. Anderson!"

With that, Isabella downed her drink in one go.

Leo narrowed his eyes slightly, watching her.

He had chosen an orange juice for her, wanting to look out for her, only to see her raise a glass of wine instead.

He felt as if she was rubbing his face in it.

Clenching his jaw subtly, Leo maintained a polite smile. After Isabella finished her drink, he did the same with his own glass and turned to leave. The crowd surrounding him dispersed as well.

Miley nudged Isabella, grinning. "Bella, that was so badass!"

"Was it?"Â Isabella replied, forcing a smile despite feeling overwhelmed.

It was strange to be called cool in such a vulnerable state.

Zaire guided Isabella through the crowd, introducing her to various people.

Though Zaire was with her, Isabella sensed that most of the attendees were only engaging out of obligation, merely humoring her as they waited for a chance to turn back to their business. They clearly didn't hold her in much regard at all.

The bidding session began shortly after.

Two speakers took the stage before Isabella was taken by surprise when the second speaker turned out to be Charles.

As she watched Charles on stage, delivering his grandiose speech, Isabella's thoughts drifted to the things Charles had done to Sebastian, and her fingers clenched tightly.

Charles paused to introduce someone special, saying, "By the way, while we're here, I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce someone important to all of you."

Everyone's gaze shifted toward Leo.

Leo was Charles' favored protege. It was no secret he was Charles' godson, although Charles had never officially acknowledged it in public before. It seemed Charles was pushing Leo forward.

Leo flashed a smile and adjusted his suit jacket, preparing to stand. But before he could, Charles' voice rang out: "Isabella!"

Leo froze.

The room erupted in murmurs.

As the spotlight illuminated Isabella, the crowd's reactions varied-shock, curiosity, scrutiny, and even congratulatory whispers.

Isabella furrowed her brow, her eyes locked on Charles. She thought 'What is he up to now?'

People began approaching Isabella, inviting her to the stage. Charles continued, "There's been a lot of gossip about a rift between me and my son Sebastian, and rumors that I'm using underhanded tactics to acquire the Landon Group. I want to set the record straight. These rumors are baseless. Sebastian and I are father and son. Isabella here can attest to that. Bella, please come up and say a few words."

Applause erupted.

Miley and Zaire exchanged glances, their expressions reflecting their concerns.

Amidst the applause, Isabella slowly rose from her seat.

Miley quickly reached out, trying to pull Isabella back. "Bella, this is a trap set by Charles. Don't walk right into it!"

Isabella glanced at her but said nothing, walking toward the stage.

"Bella."

As Isabella took the stage, Charles stepped aside, maintaining a friendly smile. He leaned in and whispered to her, "The child is already on the plane. You'll see her tomorrow."

A chill ran through Isabella. She turned sharply to look at Charles.

She understood now.

Charles wanted it all.

She thought, 'He has done so much despicable, yet doesn't want to be left with a bad reputation.

'Charles intends to use me to clean up his mess.

'There is no way I'm going to help him.'

Isabella forced a small smile. She had no intention of aiding Charles. She was on that stage to reveal the truth, to tear down Charles' facade and show everyone the ruthless side of him.

Taking a step forward, Isabella adjusted the microphone, leaning in as she began to speak.

###chapter 244 In the Emergency Room

"I'm Isabella; I'm Sebastian's fiancÃ©e."

Isabella's voice echoed throughout the hall. Suddenly, the closed door opened. Sebastian and Jack appeared there.

Isabella's eyes were red. She adjusted the microphone and continued, "I can prove that the rumors outside are false. Mr. Landon and my fiancÃ© Sebastian have always had a good father-son relationship."

Isabella was astonished. She clutched the microphone and spoke urgently, but the voice coming from the microphone did not match what she was saying.

She was clearly accusing Charles, wanting to tell everyone that Charles was a despicable person who not only harmed Sebastian but also kidnapped her daughter, Sweetie. However, the words coming from the microphone were the exact opposite.

Isabella stared at the black microphone, stunned. She finally realized that the microphone had been cut off, and the subsequent words were controlled by Charles.

Isabella yanked away from the microphone, and with it, the sound from the mic vanished. An agonizing screech replaced it.

The noise pierced Isabella's eardrums. She glanced down at the audience, her gaze skimming over the crowd to the distant door where Sebastian stood, his face expressionless.

"This isn't right."Â Isabella rushed to the microphone, but her voice was too faint and was soon drowned out by the roaring applause.

"This isn't right, this isn't right. Charles is a bad man, he's a villain!"Â Isabella surged towards Charles, but he seized her hands.

As she was standing face-to-face with Charles, Isabella's expression was one of fury while Charles wore an insincere smile.

In a tone only the two of them could hear, Charles murmured, "Isabella, thank you."

Isabella glared at him, infuriated. "Charles, aren't you afraid of going to hell for this?"

Charles didn't care what Isabella said. Instead, he laughed heartily. "Isabella, only the useless cling to hope for divine retribution. After everything that's happened, you still believe in the idea of bad guys getting their comeuppance?"

Isabella was stunned.

Indeed, if there were any justice, Charles should have long been condemned. Yet he continued to thrive and cause havoc.

"Isabella, take a look around. How do you plan to explain this to Sebastian?"Â Charles's laugh echoed ominously in her ears.

Charles had already let go of Isabella's hands, but she stood on the stage as if bound by invisible ropes, unable to move. She didn't even dare to look back, afraid of seeing Sebastian's expression and the hypocritical faces of the audience.

Miley came on stage and pulled Isabella down.

The bidding continued as if no one cared about what had happened earlier.

Isabella sat on a bench, her hands and feet cold.

Miley rubbed her fingers. "Bella, what happened? Why did you say those things?"

Isabella's eyes wavered, her lips moved, but she was at a loss for words.

She thought, 'Now, everyone thinks those words came from me. What about Sebastian?

'Everyone with eyes thinks so, let alone Sebastian who can't see but could only hear.

'Did Sebastian feel heartbroken when he heard those words?'

A strong sense of guilt washed over Isabella, making her feel like she was suffocating.

Zaire stood nearby and spoke up, "Did Charles threaten you?"

Isabella shook her head.

This time, he didn't. It was purely a trap.

She thought, 'Miley has warned me, but in my fervor, I still fell into the trap. I'm so stupid!'

Disappointment appeared in Zaire's eyes. "Isabella, are you aware that your words could drive Sebastian into utter despair?"

Isabella closed her eyes and finally regained some strength. She slowly stood up and walked out.

Miley reached out to stop her, but Zaire intervened.

Watching Isabella stumble out in a daze, Miley urged, "Isabella's in a dangerous state. I should follow her."

Zaire tightened his grip on Miley's wrist. "Dangerous? She's the real danger!"

"Zaire." Maire called him.

"Leave her alone!" Zaire said angrily, then added, "Let her calm down for a while. Following her now won't help. She's probably feeling worse than we are."

Isabella walked out, feeling dizzy. She managed to walk a few steps before collapsing.

A pair of hands reached out from behind and caught her.

Then, Isabella fell into an embrace.

Isabella smelled a strange scent. She struggled to open her eyes and saw a person she disliked.

"Leo, let go of me." Isabella tried to push him away, but her hands were weak. She only managed a slight push before falling into unconsciousness.

When Isabella woke up, she was lying on a round bed. Isabella sat up, the blanket sliding off her.

She saw Leo sitting at the foot of the bed.

Leo sat there quietly, holding a half-full glass of wine. Hearing the noise, he looked up at Isabella.

Isabella got out of bed and found her shoes missing.

She had to walk barefoot on the cold floor towards the door.

Leo didn't stop her, not even getting up from his seat.

Isabella reached the door and was about to open it when the doorbell rang.

Meanwhile, Leo's voice came from behind. "You'd better see who's outside first."

Isabella hesitated, her fingers on the lock curling instinctively.

Then she looked through the peephole and saw Jack.

Outside, Jack seemed to sense her gaze and looked up, as if making eye contact with Isabella through the peephole.

At that moment, the door lock felt burning hot. Isabella pulled her hand back, her back covered in cold sweat.

She glanced back at Leo. "What do you mean by that?"

Leaning casually against the wall, Leo replied, "Exactly what you think it means."

Isabella frowned, her gaze sharpening with disdain. "Using the same old trick over and over-don't you find it pathetic?"

"Not really,"Â Leo answered earnestly, "Whether it's pathetic or not doesn't matter. What matters is how Sebastian will see you if you walk out that door right now."

He swirled his drink and took slow, deliberate steps toward her. "Do you think, after everything that happened today, he'll still trust you?"

Isabella clenched her teeth.

As Leo approached, Isabella suddenly raised her hand and slapped him hard across the face.

Leo's eyes widened in surprise, but he didn't flinch. He held onto his glass tightly and took the blow squarely. The sound of the slap was sharp and clear.

After delivering the slap, Isabella made a move to open the door.

She thought, 'I'm sure Sebastian would believe me!

'I'd explain everything to Sebastian, piece by piece.'

Leo tilted his head, touched his cheek with his tongue, and smiled faintly, "Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention-Sebastian and Jack were also in the emergency room that day."

Isabella froze, spinning around abruptly. "What did you just say?"

###chapter 245 Foolish

Leo locked eyes with Isabella, his gaze carrying a sickly satisfaction. He maintained his smile as he said, "Yes, it was me who informed them. But for some reason, they came out after just a few minutes. And you, well, you stayed inside for a full half hour.

"They must have seen something they weren't supposed to or overheard something they shouldn't have."

Isabella froze. Suddenly, she remembered Sebastian's strange behavior when she got home that day. She recalled his question. "Where have you been?"

And then there was Jack's question. "What are your feelings for Mr. Landon?"

She had always thought it was about company issues, or something Charles had orchestrated.

She thought, 'But could it be that the problem was actually with me?'

Isabella had been in the emergency room, sobbing uncontrollably, begging Matthew not to die. When she came to, Sebastian had been standing outside the door.

She thought, 'How heartbroken must he have been?'

Just thinking about it made Isabella shudder. She took a step back and bumped into the door, which thudded ominously.

Leo observed her expression. He wanted to laugh but couldn't; instead, he felt a tight, uncomfortable pressure in his chest.

Isabella leaned against the door, taking a moment to collect herself. She knew the most urgent task was to find Sebastian and clear everything up.

She opened the door only to find it empty-Jack was already gone.

Stumbling, Isabella rushed into the elevator and frantically pressed the button for the ground floor.

As the doors were about to close, a hand shot in to stop them. The doors slid open again, and a tall man stepped inside.

Isabella didn't look at him. After he entered, she quickly pressed the close door button a few times and leaned against the wall, waiting for the elevator to descend.

The man stood behind her, noticing her anxious behavior. He narrowed his eyes slightly before shifting his gaze to her face.

When the elevator reached the ground floor, Isabella bolted out.

The man followed her out, walking a few steps ahead before stopping to watch her run away. When a car pulled up in front of him, and the driver opened the door, he finally looked away and got in.

Unable to find Sebastian's car, Isabella took out her phone and dialed his number.

The phone rang for what felt like ages before it was answered.

"Sebastian,"Â Isabella's voice was frantic.

There was no response from the other end.

"Sebastian, where are you?"Â Isabella continued walking forward, her voice filled with desperation. She had no idea where to find him.

The silence continued.

Isabella was almost in tears. "The whole thing was a trap set by Charles. I really didn't know. I'm so sorry. I can explain everything, including what happened in the emergency room. Can you please just listen?"

"Okay,"Â Sebastian finally spoke up, "Stay where you are. I'll have Jack come get you."

It was ten minutes before Jack found Isabella.

She was sitting by the roadside, looking like a lost child.

Once she was in the car, she asked, "Jack, how is Sebastian?"

Jack frowned slightly and replied coldly, "As long as you don't hurt him anymore, he'll be fine."

Isabella was left speechless.

The two sat in silence as Jack drove the car back to the white building. He turned off the engine, parked, and led Isabella upstairs to find Sebastian.

Jack pushed open a door and said, "You can go in now."

Isabella nodded and walked inside.

The door closed softly behind her, leaving the room enveloped in stillness. Isabella spotted Sebastian standing on the balcony.

Her heart leaped. She hurried over and wrapped her arms around him from behind. Before she could say a word, tears began streaming down her face, soaking into his back.

When her sobs had mostly subsided, Sebastian turned around and took her hand in his. "You had something to explain, didn't you? Seeing you like this makes it hard for me to stay mad."

Isabella looked up at him, her eyes searching his face. "Are you angry with me?"

Sebastian gave a small, almost sad smile. "How could I be mad at you, Bella? I'm just worried that I might not be able to protect you the way I should."

"Don't say that,"Â Isabella said, placing a hand over his mouth, "You've done more than enough. It's me who should apologize."

She continued quickly, "Zaire brought me here today because I wanted to learn about business. I was careful, but it turns out Charles had other plans. I didn't mean to say those things. I wanted to expose Charles for the snake he is. But then the microphone went dead, and another voice spoke up instead."Â Isabella's voice was filled with urgency.

Sebastian listened quietly, nodding. "I know. The voice wasn't yours."

A flicker of hope sparked in Isabella's eyes. "You heard that? You believe me?"

Sebastian gently squeezed her delicate shoulders. "It's too windy out here. Let's talk inside."

Once they were back in the room, Sebastian drew the curtains and, as he turned around, found Isabella hugging him tightly.

He lowered his head, letting his chin brush against her soft hair.

Isabella looked up at him, mustering the courage to ask, "That day in the hospital-did you go to the emergency room?"

Sebastian hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Yes."

Isabella's anxiety flared. "Did you hear everything?"

"Yeah,"Â Sebastian replied simply.

"It's not exactly as you think. Matthew was on the brink of death in prison, having swallowed nails to kill himself. Charles promised me he'd return Sweetie before I went to rescue him,"Â Isabella explained.

Sebastian's eyes softened with a flicker of hope. "He promised to return Sweetie to us?"

"Yes. Sweetie was taken out of town, which is why it's been so hard to find her. I agreed to help Charles pull Matthew back from the brink of death, and in return, he arranged for Sweetie to be brought back. We should see our daughter by tomorrow at the latest."

Despite the hopeful news, Sebastian's face showed no sign of joy. He looked at Isabella with his hollow eyes. "Bella, you're being foolish."

Isabella felt a pang in her heart and shook her head. "I trust Charles. He wouldn't gamble with Matthew's life."

Sebastian closed his eyes briefly. "I'll have people stationed at all the airports and bus stations in Lakina tomorrow. But Bella, what if Charles goes back on his word?"

"It won't happen!"Â Isabella blurted out, surprised by her own fierce confidence.

Sebastian continued to look at her in silence.

Isabella muttered, "It won't happen. If Charles breaks his word, he will pay the price."

As her words faded, Sebastian pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly. He whispered in her ear, "Bella, I don't trust Charles, but I trust you."

Isabella tightened her grip on her own fingers, but fear was starting to creep into her eyes.

In the hospital, Matthew opened his eyes to see Emma hovering over him.

"Matthew, you're awake?"Â Emma immediately pressed the call button and then threw her arms around Matthew, sobbing uncontrollably. "My son, you scared me half to death."

Matthew glanced around, his gaze settling on the white ceiling. He tried to speak but couldn't make a sound.

The nails he had swallowed had cut his throat and damaged his vocal cords. He was now truly mute.

###chapter 246 A Very Good Person

After the doctor came to check, he told Emma, "His vital signs are stable for now, no major issues. But you still need to be careful. His emotional state doesn't seem good, and you need to prevent him from committing suicide again."

Emma was startled and nodded repeatedly. "Okay, okay."

After the doctor left, Emma returned to the bedside and tried to muster a smile. "Matthew, are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?"

Matthew looked at her.

Emma continued, "We can only have liquid food for now. I remember you love oatmeal the most. How about I ask the housekeeper to make some and bring it over?"

As she spoke, Emma took out her phone to make a call.

But as soon as she took out her phone, Matthew, who had been lying down, suddenly sat up and snatched the phone from her.

He opened the editor, typed a line, and handed it to Emma.

Matthew: [Where is Isabella?]

Emma choked up a bit and smiled. "Do you want to see Isabella?"

Matthew just looked at her quietly.

"Matthew, I know you want to see her, but she's Sebastian's fiancÃ©e now. Charles had a huge falling out with Sebastian over your situation. She won't come to see you now." Emma said.

Matthew's eyes were stormy with determination. He tossed his phone aside and yanked out the IV, trying to get out of bed.

"Matthew!"Â Emma was stunned for a moment, then quickly wrapped her arms around his waist. "Matthew, what are you doing?"

Matthew, frenzied, ignored her protests and yanked open the door, trying to rush out. But the moment he opened it, two prison guards stationed outside stopped him in his tracks. "3087, where do you think you're going?"

Matthew froze.

Emma pulled him back into the room, apologizing profusely to the guards.

Once the door was closed, Emma said, "Matthew, you still have a few months left on your sentence. Once you're healed, you'll have to return to serve your time. You need to focus on recovering, not on running away!"

Matthew stared at her for a long moment, then turned back to his phone to type: [I need to see Isabella!]

Emma frowned. "Why do you need to see her? All these years, haven't I been enough for you compared to some woman on the outside?"

Matthew remained silent. He deleted the previous message and typed a new one: [I need to see Isabella. If I can't see her, I'll die!]

Emma gritted her teeth. "Fine. I'll bring her to see you. But Matthew, you have to promise me that after you've seen her, you'll stay alive and take care of yourself!"

Matthew finally nodded.

The next morning, Isabella woke up early.

She opened her eyes to find Sebastian dressing. His movements were slow and careful, given his blindness.

Isabella got up and walked over to help him with his cufflinks, then took a moment to admire him. "You look very dapper today."

Sebastian brushed his hand against her cheek and smiled. "It's our first time seeing our daughter, so I figured I should make an effort. Can't have her thinking her dad is a slob."

Isabella's eyes welled up a bit, her smile tinged with emotion. "She's just a baby. What does she know?"

Sebastian said, "Even so, I want to make a good impression."

Isabella stood on tiptoe and kissed the corner of his mouth. "I'm going to freshen up."

"Okay."

Downstairs, Jack had been waiting for a while.

After a quick breakfast, they set out for Lakina's largest airport.

According to Charles, the plane bringing Sweetie would land at ten o'clock. Sebastian's team had been in place at all the major airports and key exits since midnight. By the time Isabella and Sebastian arrived at the airport, it was barely seven in the morning.

The morning mist was still lingering, and sunlight hadn't yet broken through. The entire airport seemed to be enveloped in a thin, ethereal haze, surreal and dreamlike.

Sebastian found a prominent spot and sat with Isabella, waiting.

The airport's announcements came in a steady stream, and people flowed in and out around them, an endless parade of faces and movements, never pausing.

Isabella watched the minutes tick by, each one dragging by with agonizing slowness.

Sebastian held her hand, his usual calmness replaced with an even deeper silence.

Isabella turned to Sebastian, feeling the tension radiating from him.

At this moment, Sebastian was more anxious than she was.

Unable to suppress a smile, Isabella gently rubbed the back of his hand with her thumb. "You're going to love Sweetie when you see her."

Sebastian managed a smile. "Our daughter is my little bundle of joy. Of course, I'll love her."

Isabella thought about how he had once believed Sweetie wasn't his and how they had missed each other time and again. She couldn't help but feel a mix of amusement and regret. "I should have told you sooner."

If she had told him earlier, they might have had some time together before Sweetie was taken away. They could have had those precious early moments.

Sebastian lifted her hand and placed a gentle kiss on it. "I pride myself on being clever, but I was so foolish I couldn't even recognize you. When Vanessa was impersonating you, there were so many obvious flaws, and yet I didn't see through it. Bella, I've missed so much time with you and our baby. I've been a terrible partner."

"Don't say that,"Â Isabella replied, her voice tinged with guilt, "Sebastian, you're a wonderful person."

Sebastian held her hand with a faint smile. "Bella, if Charles keeps his word and brings our daughter back to us, I promise, I'll let the past be the past."

Letting the past be the past.

The phrase sounded simple enough, but Isabella felt there was something more behind his words. Before she could ponder it further, the airport's announcement system crackled to life, reporting the latest flight arrivals.

Jack checked the information three times, his excitement barely contained. "Mr. Landon, Isabella, this is the flight! It's landed ten minutes early!"

Before Isabella could fully process the joy, she saw two police officers approaching from a short distance. The silver gleam of their handcuffs sent a chill down her spine.

An uneasy premonition struck Isabella.

As the officers drew closer, Isabella instinctively stepped forward, positioning herself in front of Sebastian.

Her movement startled both Jack and Sebastian, and even the officers glanced in her direction. Their gaze lingered momentarily on Sebastian before they shifted their focus to the arrival gate.

Isabella broke into a cold sweat.

The officers only stared at Sebastian for a few seconds before turning their attention away.

Sebastian, sensing Isabella's unease, lightly scratched the palm of her hand with his fingertips and asked, "What's wrong?"

Jack also looked at Isabella strangely.

Isabella bit her lip and whispered, "Two police officers came. I thought they were here to arrest you."

Sebastian was silent.

"Bella, don't be afraid. I'll be fine." Sebastian squeezed Isabella's fingers, his voice gentle.

Isabella felt she was being too sensitive. Just as she was about to nod, she saw out of the corner of her eye the two police officers walking towards the arrival gate. In front of everyone, they handcuffed a short-haired man.

###chapter 247 Then Let Him Die

The man, slender and dressed in a loose hoodie, had been struggling futilely against the handcuffs the police had put on him.

Isabella thought, 'So he is a criminal they were after!'

Isabella's tense heart relaxed slightly as the police pulled off the man's mask and hat, revealing a gaunt face.

Even from a distance, Isabella recognized him immediately.

"Samantha?"Â Isabella exclaimed, already moving toward the commotion.

It was indeed Samantha!

Only now, with her hair cut short and her appearance changed to blend in with men, had Isabella failed to recognize her earlier.

Isabella stepped forward, her excitement palpable, but the police blocked her path.

"Samantha, you're back. Where's my daughter? Where is she?"

Samantha bit her lip, her eyes welling up with unshed tears, but she couldn't answer Isabella's question. She lowered her head in shame.

The officers stopped Isabella from approaching further. "Do you know her?"

Isabella, unaware of Samantha's crimes, was only concerned about Sweetie's whereabouts. "We were college roommates. Could you tell me, officer, what is she being charged with?"

"Child trafficking."

Isabella's eyes widened in shock. "What?"

"We received a tip-off confirming she had indeed kidnapped a child. We were specifically stationed at the airport to catch her. When you asked about your daughter, were you referring to yourself as Isabella?"

Isabella nodded, struggling to keep up with the rapid developments. "Yes."

"According to the tip, Samantha was involved in taking your newborn child, correct?"

Isabella was stunned.

She had known that since Sweetie's birth, Samantha had been taking care of Sweetie. Samantha was now associated with Charles and Emma, and before Sweetie disappeared, it was Samantha who had been with her. Isabella had always believed that finding Samantha would lead her to Sweetie.

But now, Samantha had appeared without Sweetie, who was nowhere to be found. Instead, Samantha was being arrested and charged with child trafficking.

The informant, the tip-off-if Isabella was right, these were likely orchestrated by Charles!

Samantha was taken to the police station.

Isabella and Sebastian followed, leaving part of their group at the airport.

In the interrogation room, the police fired off questions.

"Ms. Miller, when and where was your child born? Was there any blood work done, and what was the baby's gender?

"During your delivery, was Samantha present? Did she take your child directly?

"We understand your child has been missing for at least a month. Why didn't you report it sooner? Did you have any involvement in the child's disappearance?"

Each question pierced Isabella's heart like a dagger, and her answers were few and far between.

With Samantha now a suspect and Sweetie still missing, there was no news from the airport, no updates from the docks, and no movement at any of Lakina's entry points.

Isabella's hope had finally been shattered by nightfall.

Once again, Charles had outplayed her!

Isabella spoke Charles' name.

The police paused in surprise. "Are you saying that Charles is involved in your child's disappearance?"

"Yes! He was the one who incited Samantha to take my child."

"Why didn't you report it?"

Isabella hesitated, then replied, "I was afraid he would hurt the child."

The police took note of her statements and assured her that they would conduct a thorough investigation.

When Isabella emerged from the interrogation room, Jack was waiting outside. "Mr. Landon's in the car, waiting for you,"Â he said before turning and walking away without another word.

At this point, Isabella had lost all desire to face Sebastian. She had promised that Sweetie would come back today, but reality had delivered a harsh blow.

Standing outside the car, Isabella saw Sebastian sitting inside, her heart aching with every beat.

Jack opened the car door. "Get in."

Isabella lifted her leg to step forward, but just then, her phone rang. An unfamiliar number flashed on the screen.

She hesitated for a moment before answering, "Hello?"

A voice on the other end said, "Bella, Matthew wants to see you."

Isabella forced a tight smile. "Emma, you and Charles are really pushing it!"

Sebastian turned slightly in his seat, his gaze fixed on her.

"Bella, I swear I don't know what Charles has done. I'm begging you-come see Matthew. He just wants to see you. I promise he won't harm you."

Isabella's lips curled into a cold smile. "I've already reported Charles. Everything you two have done will come to light eventually. I'm not going to see Matthew."

"Bella, if you don't come, he'll die!"

"Then let him die!"Â Isabella yelled into the phone, her emotions frayed and on the edge.

The call was on speaker.

Isabella's desperate words, "Then let him die!"Â echoed through the empty hospital room.

Emma's eyes widened in shock. She grabbed the phone, trying to turn off the speaker, but Isabella had already hung up.

Matthew sat on the hospital bed, holding the phone that had just been hung up. For a long while, he didn't move.

"Matthew,"Â Emma said softly, stepping forward to take the phone from his hand. She wrapped her arms around him in a comforting embrace. "It's okay. It's just one woman. There are plenty more out there. We don't need Isabella.

"Listen to me, Matthew. Once you're back on your feet, we'll sort everything out. Just a few months left, and I'll make sure everything is set up for when you're out. You're still young; this prison stint won't define you. I'm already making plans for a fresh start in a new city. Remember how you've always liked Mosterwania? I'm already checking out houses there. I promise, everything will be ready before you're released."

Emma spoke in a flurry of words, focusing entirely on hopeful plans for the future, leaving the present unmentioned.

Matthew looked at her, as if he were beginning to understand something.

Though Matthew was in the hospital, he was still serving his sentence, and even Emma's presence couldn't change that. Once visiting hours were over, she would have to leave.

When Emma got home, night had already fallen.

"Mrs. Landon, you're back,"Â Karen said, handing Emma her slippers and casting a glance upstairs with a different look in her eyes.

Emma glanced at her and asked casually, "Is Charles back?"

"Yes, he is, in his study handling some business. He's instructed not to be disturbed."

Emma acknowledged this with a nod and started up the stairs.

Karen followed her a few steps, adding, "Mrs. Landon, Mr. Landon isn't in the best of moods today. He's asked not to be disturbed. You might want to think twice before interrupting him."

Emma paused on the stairs at this remark, then turned to look at Karen. "Karen, you're a servant, and I'm the mistress of this house. Do you think it's appropriate for you to speak to me like that?"

"Mrs. Landon, that wasn't my intention at all."

Emma sneered, her eyes full of disdain. "I'm the lady of this house. I'll go where I please, without needing your permission."

Karen fell silent, lowering her head and daring not to say another word.

Emma gave her one last scornful look before continuing up the stairs.

Originally, Emma had intended to head straight to her bedroom, but something prompted her to turn and head towards the study instead.

She knew Karen's warning was well-meaning and that angering Charles could lead to trouble, but at this moment, she felt a pressing need to discuss Matthew's situation with him.

Standing at the door of the study, Emma was about to knock when she heard the sound of a woman's moans coming from inside.

Emma froze, a chill running down her spine. In the next moment, she pushed the door open with a forceful shove.

###chapter 248 A Woman

The loud noise startled everyone inside.

The two intertwined figures on the sofa quickly pulled apart, but the lingering sensual atmosphere in the room took a moment to dissipate.

The room was dark, with no lights on and the curtains tightly drawn.

Emma switched on the lights, and the sudden brightness stung her eyes for a moment.

But even more painful than the blinding light was the sight before her.

On the sofa in the study, Charles and Siena Scott were partially undressed. Charles was sprawled over Siena's youthful body, his face flushed and sweat glistening on his forehead.

Siena, startled by the sudden illumination, scrambled to cover herself with a piece of clothing, curling up in the corner of the sofa. Her face was a mix of panic and embarrassment as she looked up at Emma.

The instant their eyes met, Emma's expression shifted dramatically. Nearly losing her composure, she stormed over, grabbing Siena by the chin with a grip that could have crushed bone. Her eyes were daggers as they bore into Siena's face.

Siena's face was young and radiant, a stark contrast to the middle-aged Emma. But Emma wasn't concerned with such things.

She held Siena's chin tightly and glared at Charles, her voice dripping with venom. "You're really desperate, aren't you? You can't resist even now?"

Charles, annoyed by the tone, frowned but remained calm. He nonchalantly put on his jacket, reached for a cigarette from the box on the table, and lit it. Puffing out smoke, he said coolly, "Get your hands off her."

Emma's rage was palpable. She squeezed Siena's chin with all her strength, almost as if Emma wanted to crush her face.

In the end, Emma could only glare at Siena before shoving her away.

Siena was nearly knocked off the sofa by Emma's forceful push. She scrambled to steady herself, but the garment she was holding slipped away, revealing the red marks on her skin-like blooming flowers, they were vivid and painful to see.

Siena, propped up on the sofa, looked utterly defeated, breathing heavily and barely moving.

Charles glanced at her and tossed a light blanket over her. "I'll have the driver take you home."

Siena, with her eyes cast down, nodded slightly, wrapping herself in the blanket and making her way out with unsteady steps.

Charles watched her leave, his fingers tightening around the almost broken cigar in his hand. The heat from the burning ember stung his skin, snapping him back to reality.

Turning his attention back to Emma, he met her scornful gaze.

Charles frowned, looking at the broken cigar in his hand. His mood had soured, and he snuffed out the cigar, speaking in a low voice, "This was an accident."

He paused, then added, "Don't worry. I'll handle it. No one will shake your position as Mrs. Landon."

Emma couldn't hold back a bitter laugh. "Mrs. Landon? If outsiders knew that my role as Mrs. Landon is just a facade, they'd probably burst out laughing. Charles, after all these years, with Matthew being this grown, aside from that one time you took revenge on Anna, you've never had any interest in me. What do I mean to you?"

Charles' displeasure was evident. His voice was icy as he replied, "Emma, am I giving you too much leeway?"

Emma clenched her teeth, remaining silent.

Charles glanced at Emma, but his mind was filled with the fragile and youthful face of Siena. He felt a twinge of annoyance and said, "I've told you before, you're Matthew's mother. And in my lifetime, Matthew is the only biological son I have. That's why I married you, just to give Matthew a sense of legitimacy. I've given you the position of Mrs. Landon, allowed you to live a life of luxury for so many years, and yet you're still not satisfied. What is it, Mrs. Landon? You've been around for too long, and now you want to talk about feelings with me? Emma, don't forget how you climbed into my bed in the first place!"

Emma trembled, and two clear tears slid down her cheeks.

Charles, however, didn't bother to give her another glance. He stood up and said, "Your role is to be a good mother and a virtuous Mrs. Landon. Don't aspire for anything else. Otherwise, I'll make everything go back to square one and leave you with nothing."

With these words, Charles angrily left.

Emma collapsed on the ground, crying inconsolably.

Outside the window, a heavy rainstorm suddenly broke out.

Amidst the thunderous roar, Isabella suddenly awoke from her dream, with remnants of the dream still lingering in her consciousness. Her ears seemed to echo with the sound of a child crying.

"Sweetie!" She reached out to touch, but there was nothing beside her.

Even Sebastian was gone.

"Sebastian?" Isabella called out twice across the darkness.

But the entire room was dark and silent, with no response.

Large raindrops pounded on the window, and a flash of light caught Isabella's attention. Without turning on the lights, she got out of bed barefoot and walked to the window to look.

Through the rain, she saw a car parked downstairs, and Sebastian seemed to have gotten into that car.

But it didn't seem like they were leaving. Instead, the car turned off its engine and sat quietly in the rain.

Isabella waited for a few minutes, but the car didn't move, and Sebastian didn't come down.

A sense of unease rose in her heart. She bit her lip and went downstairs barefoot.

Only a few wall lamps were turned on downstairs, casting a spooky glow in the silence.

Isabella grabbed an umbrella and stepped out the door.

When she walked up to the car, the door suddenly opened, and Jack walked over. "Isabella, why are you out here?"

As Jack spoke, he cast a glance at the darkened second floor. With no lights on and the storm obscuring everything, it wasn't until Isabella approached that he noticed.

Isabella didn't respond to Jack; instead, she peered through the car window. The windows were coated with a one-way film, and in the pouring rain and deep night, visibility was almost non-existent.

"Where's Sebastian?" Isabella asked directly, "It looked like he got into this car."

Jack pressed his lips together. "Mr. Landon is handling something. Isabella, you should go back to bed."

Isabella was confused.

But she nodded slightly and turned to head back inside.

Jack, relieved to see her follow his advice, watched her closely until she had re-entered the house before finally getting into the car himself.

Once inside, Isabella quickly moved to the living room's floor-to-ceiling windows. She lifted a corner of the curtain and kept her gaze locked on the car.

After about ten minutes, Jack got out of the car again. He walked around to the front, opened the rear passenger door, and held up an umbrella to shield the entrance from the rain.

Isabella saw Sebastian step out of the car, and her eyes darted beyond him, catching a fleeting glimpse of a woman's silhouette.

In an instant, the car door slammed shut.

###chapter 249 Long Road Ahead

Isabella settled back onto the bed, and after a while, she heard footsteps followed by the sound of the door opening.

The mattress dipped beside her as Sebastian lay down. Instinctively, Isabella turned and wrapped her arms around his waist.

Sebastian paused for a moment before gently patting her shoulder. His voice was as soft as ever. "Did I wake you?"

Isabella nodded. "Yeah."

"Sorry about that." Sebastian embraced her and placed a tender kiss on her forehead. "There was a bit of a crisis at the office. It was urgent, so I had to take care of it."

Isabella stayed silent for a moment, then nodded. "Mm-hmm."

"Good girl. Go back to sleep," Sebastian murmured into her ear.

Isabella buried her face in Sebastian's chest, inhaling the faint, unfamiliar scent of his cologne. She could feel the dampness from his sweater, and her mind swirled with confusion.

The next morning, Jack arrived with a ready-made breakfast and a stack of company files.

Accompanying him was Laura, who Isabella hadn't seen in a while.

"Isabella, long time no see," Laura said. Her attire hadn't changed much, but her demeanor was noticeably softer, and she seemed more friendly.

Isabella's memories of Laura were filled with deliberate hostility and a sharp temper, so she was unsure how to react to this new version of Laura.

Laura seemed to sense her confusion and smiled. "Isabella, I owe you an apology for the way I acted before. Back then, I was pretty arrogant, thinking I was the most beautiful in the office and deserving of all the attention. I resented Mr. Landon's favoritism towards you, an intern, and took it out on you. But after everything with Vanessa, and being deceived by that jerk, I had a wake-up call. I've had some time to reflect, and I've realized how wrong I was. I'm sorry for how I treated you. I've wanted to apologize for a long time, but never had the chance."

Looking at Laura, Isabella could tell she had been through her own struggles recently.

They weren't exactly friends, just colleagues who had clashed in the past. Isabella didn't hold any grudges that needed forgiving, so she just smiled.

While Isabella and Sebastian were having breakfast, Jack and Laura were in the living room, sorting through documents and discussing something.

Once Isabella finished her meal, Sebastian turned to Laura and said, "I'm leaving her in your hands."

He gave Isabella a gentle nudge forward.

Laura responded with a smile, "Don't worry, Mr. Landon. I'll make sure everything gets done!"

Isabella looked puzzled. "What's going on?"

Sebastian's voice was gentle. "You wanted to learn about business, right? Starting today, Laura will be your guide. She'll help you with the small stuff at the office and gradually ease you in."

Isabella was taken aback, unsure how to react.

It all felt so sudden.

Sebastian added, "I've already talked to Zaire. From now on, I'll be personally teaching you, so you won't need to trouble him."

Isabella wanted to learn, mainly to help Sebastian share the load and ease his burdens. But Sebastian's formal approach caught her off guard and felt a bit overwhelming.

Sebastian gently reassured her, "It's okay. Laura will start by teaching you the basics, like the company structure and all. Once you're comfortable with that, I'll take over and teach you more advanced stuff."

"But I..."

"Bella, we've got a long future ahead of us. Do you want to be my eyes?"

Isabella looked into Sebastian's hollow eyes and nodded, "I do. Sebastian, I'll learn seriously."

Sebastian smiled and brushed his warm palm against her face. "I believe in you, Bella. You're going to do great."

With that, Laura stayed behind to begin Isabella's training while Sebastian and Jack headed out.

Isabella hadn't asked about the events of the previous night, but the unanswered questions gnawed at her mind.

She thought, 'Who was that woman who showed up in the middle of the night? Sebastian claimed it was work-related, but I know everyone in the company's secretarial department, and that figure, even seen from a distance, didn't seem to belong there.

'Moreover, Sebastian is usually so considerate. Even if there was an emergency, he would have been concerned about my standing in the rain for so long. Yet, last night, he hasn't even rolled down the car window.

'It was completely out of character for him.'

"Isabella, Isabella?"Â Laura's voice broke through her thoughts.

Isabella blinked and met Laura's concerned gaze. "Are you okay?"

Isabella shook her head, though her mind was clearly elsewhere. She looked down at the stack of documents in her hands, but the words seemed to blur together.

Just as Isabella was trying to focus on the text, Laura reached over and gently took the papers away.

"You don't seem to be in the right frame of mind today. Trying to push through this isn't going to help. How about we take a break instead?"

Isabella, recognizing her own lack of focus, rubbed her temples and agreed, "Alright."

Laura brewed two cups of coffee, and the two women sat by the floor-to-ceiling windows, sipping slowly.

Outside, the rain was falling in fits and starts, but it had picked up again.

"That rain last night was something else,"Â Laura remarked, "It was like someone was pouring it straight from the sky. And that thunder-it woke me up right out of a dead sleep."

Isabella couldn't help but recall the events of the previous night, the fog of uncertainty in her mind growing thicker by the minute.

"Isabella?"Â Laura noticed her drifting off and gently pulled on her sleeve.

Isabella turned, meeting Laura's concerned gaze.

"Isabella, there's a lot of gossip going around. People are saying Mr. Landon had a falling out with his father and is caught up in a business war. You and Mr. Landon must be having a rough time too, right?"

Isabella sighed. "Yeah, it's been tough."

Lately, she'd been plagued by nightmares and hadn't had a good night's sleep in ages.

Laura hesitated for a moment before speaking up, "Mr. Landon is a good man. It's not easy to find someone like him. I've had my fair share of relationship troubles, and in today's world, good men are almost extinct. Mr. Landon is wealthy, handsome, and young-who knows what kind of trouble he could get into? But from what I know, he's still a man of good character."

Isabella studied her for a moment before breaking into a smile. "You don't often speak so highly of people."

Laura blushed slightly. "I'm not just flattering him; I'm being honest. Look, we have a lot of young, beautiful women in our company. If Mr. Landon so much as beckons, they'd flock to him. Remember how Vanessa tried to impersonate you just to marry him? If Mr. Landon were the kind of man you're worried about, his reputation would have already fallen apart."

Isabella's thoughts drifted back to the scene from last night, the image of Sebastian getting out of the car flashing through her mind. She had been so doubtful, but Laura's words had eased her fears.

She thought, 'Yes, I should trust Sebastian.

'Sebastian isn't that kind of person!'

Isabella let out a deep breath, feeling a bit lighter. "Thanks, Laura."

Laura looked puzzled. "For what?"

"For what you just said,"Â Isabella replied, picking up her empty cup. "I'm going to get a refill. You stay here."

"Alright,"Â Laura said with a smile, watching Isabella head back into the room. Then she pulled out her phone and dialed Jack.

"Hello, Mr. Brown. The task is complete."

###chapter 250 Eye Pain

In the CEO's office of the Landon Group, Jack hung up the phone and turned to Sebastian. "Laura followed my instructions. She says Isabella is feeling better now, and Laura'll continue to stay with her. If anything changes, Laura'll report it right away, so there's no need for you to worry."

"Hmm."Â Sebastian nodded.

Jack paused for a moment before adding, "Honestly, you don't have to keep this from her."

"I have my reasons for not saying anything. Jack, keep a lid on it."

"Yes, sir."

Sebastian shuffled through the documents in his hands for a while before pressing his fingers to his temples; his brow furrowed in pain.

"Is it your eyes again?"Â Jack asked, "Maybe I should read the reports to you?"

"No need."Â Sebastian rubbed his eyes with his hand, his voice tinged with suppressed pain. "Call Marvin over."

"Got it."Â Jack didn't waste any time and quickly dialed Marvin.

An hour later, the door to the lounge opened, and Marvin walked out.

Jack immediately set aside the documents and went to meet him. "How's Mr. Landon doing?"

Marvin stretched his limbs before responding, "Not so great."

"What do you mean, 'not so great'? Isn't acupuncture supposed to help? You said that with some sessions, Mr. Landon's eyesight would be fine. How is it that after just a few days, it's already acting up again?"Â Jack peppered Marvin with questions.

Marvin shot Jack a slightly irritated glance but chose not to retort immediately. Instead, he walked over and poured himself a glass of water.

After drinking, Marvin said, "Did I not mention that Mr. Landon shouldn't overwork himself and should limit his screen time to two hours a day? Did any of you actually listen and follow the medical advice? His eyes aren't like glass balls that you can just replace if they break!"

Jack was silenced by Marvin's words.

Feeling guilty, Jack dropped the subject and glanced at the closed lounge door. "Is it critical right now? Mr. Landon's been complaining about eye pain these past few days."

Marvin downed another glass of water, looking as though he might dehydrate if he didn't.

"I just finished a half-hour acupuncture session. He's sleeping now. The eyes are one of the most delicate parts of the body, and they don't heal as quickly as other injuries. If Mr. Landon continues to overwork himself, not even my ancestors would be able to save him!"

Sebastian was deep in sleep.

His dreams were a chaotic blur, dragging his soul downward.

He fell through thick clouds and landed in an entirely unfamiliar place. As he looked around, a soft, gentle voice called from behind.

"Sebastian."

He turned and saw a white figure standing in an ornate garden.

Anna, looking like an angel, stood amidst the beautiful thorny flowers. Her gaze was always exceptionally tender whenever she looked at him. Anna raised her hand, waving at him.

"Mom!"Â Sebastian choked on the words, stepping forward, but a sharp pain shot through his feet.

Sebastian looked down and saw himself barefoot on a field of thorns.

The thorns seemed to rise from the ground, instantly enveloping him. Sebastian tried to run, but the thorns dug deep into his flesh. Blood dripped onto the stems and leaves, turning the sharp thorns into clusters of vividly beautiful flowers.

"Sebastian."

The voice continued to call him.

It came in waves, as if it was right by his ear, yet somehow miles away.

Sebastian lifted his head and leaned forward, but he couldn't move at all. He could only watch helplessly as the thorny sea of flowers continued to spread, pulling him further away from Anna.

"Mom!"

Sebastian shouted in distress and jolted upright from the bed, feeling as though someone had slammed a hammer into his head. The pain was so intense it felt like his head might explode.

He pressed his hands over his eyes, the veins on his eyelids throbbing with each heartbeat, as if they might tear him apart.

Jack opened the door and walked in. "Mr. Landon?"

To avoid hurting Sebastian's eyes with the light, Jack didn't turn on the lamp but pulled the curtains open just enough to let in some of the natural light.

Sebastian cradled his head for a while, gradually managing to catch his breath.

Looking out the window, Sebastian saw that night had fallen. The dark clouds hung low, heavy and oppressive, making the air feel thick and suffocating.

He asked, "What time is it?"

Jack replied, "It's almost five. You've been out for a few hours, about three."

Sebastian closed his eyes briefly and checked his phone. He saw missed calls and three text messages from Isabella.

Opening the messages, he read, "Sebastian, are you off work yet?

"I've been trying to reach you, but Jack said you were busy.

"I'm really being ridiculous, sending texts when I know you can't see them."

Sebastian read through each message and then marked them as unread before getting out of bed. He grabbed his coat and headed for the door. "Take me back."

"Yes, Mr. Landon."

Once in the car, Sebastian called Isabella.

As soon as the phone rang, Isabella answered, "Hello, Sebastian. Are you done with work?"

Hearing her voice helped calm Sebastian's mood considerably. "Yes. What are you up to?"

"Just going through some documents,"Â Isabella said, glancing at Laura on the opposite couch with a hint of embarrassment before stepping out onto the balcony. "I've learned quite a bit today."

"Really? I'll have to test your knowledge when I get back."

"Sure thing, I'm up for it,"Â Isabella said, though her confidence wavered a bit, "Just don't make it too hard. After looking through all those files today, I realize how tough it is to get into business."

During her school years, Isabella was a top student. While not necessarily the best, she was certainly among the upper-middle achievers and stood out due to her dedication and hard work. However, after delving into the company's documents today, she understood just how challenging it was to grasp the business world.

And Laura's knowledge, though helpful, was only basic.

Just coming into contact with these materials made Isabella realize how incredibly challenging it must have been for Sebastian to build the Landon Group from the ground up over the years.

"It won't be too hard."Â Sebastian chuckled. "I'll stick to simple questions."

Isabella laughed too. "What are you up to right now?"

"Just got in the car,"Â Sebastian glanced ahead. "On my way back."

"I'll cook dinner then,"Â Isabella offered, "Anything specific you'd like?"

"Anything you make is perfect,"Â Sebastian replied warmly.

"Great, I'll get started. Make sure Jack drives slowly so I have a bit more time."

"Will do."

After hanging up, Isabella went out to buy some ingredients.

Laura approached her. "It's getting late. Mr. Landon should be back soon, so I'll head out now."

Isabella stopped her. "I'm about to cook dinner. If you leave now, you'll probably end up with takeout. Why not stay and have a meal? You can leave with Jack afterward."

Jack hung up the phone and said to Sebastian, "Laura has done exactly as I instructed. She said Isabella is much better now, and she'll continue to stay with Isabella. She'll report any situation immediately, so you don't need to worry."

"Okay." Sebastian nodded.

Jack paused and said, "Actually, you don't have to hide this from her."

"I have my reasons for not telling her. Jack, keep your mouth shut." Sebastian said.

"Okay, Mr. Landon." Jack said.

Sebastian flipped through the documents in his hand. After a while, he raised his hand to rub his temples, his brows furrowed deeply.

"Are your eyes hurting again?" Jack asked, "How about I read it to you?"

"No need." Sebastian pressed his eyes with his hands, his voice filled with restrained pain. "Call Marvin over."

"Okay." Jack didn't dare delay and immediately called Marvin.

An hour later, the door to the lounge opened, and Marvin walked out.

Jack immediately put down the documents and approached him. "How is Mr. Landon?"

Marvin stretched a bit and said, "Not good."

"What do you mean? Aren't you supposed to be a master of traditional techniques? Didn't you say that after a period of acupuncture, as long as the acupoints are cleared, Mr. Landon's eyes would be fine? How come his vision is failing again just a few days after it recovered?" Jack bombarded him with questions.

Marvin gave Jack a slightly annoyed look but didn't rush to refute him. Instead, he walked over and poured himself a glass of water.

After drinking, Marvin said, "Did I mention that Mr. Landon should not be overworked and his screen time should not exceed two hours per day? Did you listen? Did you strictly follow the doctor's orders? Those are eyes, not glass marbles. If they get damaged, you can't just fix them and replace them. What were you thinking?"

Marvin's few words left Jack speechless.

Knowing he was in the wrong, Jack stopped questioning. He glanced at the closed door of the lounge and asked, "Is it serious now? Mr. Landon has been complaining about eye pain these past two days."

Marvin drank another glass of water, looking genuinely parched.

"I just did half an hour of acupuncture, and he's asleep now. The eyes are the most delicate part of the body, and they don't recover as easily as other parts. If Mr. Landon continues to overexert himself,I may be entirely unable to save him.

Sebastian slept deeply. He had many dreams. The dreams intertwined, pulling his soul downward.

He fell through thick clouds and arrived at a completely unfamiliar place. As he looked around in confusion, a gentle voice suddenly came from behind him."Sebastian."

He turned around and saw a white figure standing in a European-style garden.

Anna looked as gentle and beautiful as an angel. When she looked at him, her eyes were always exceptionally tender. Anna stood in the beautiful thorny flower bushes, raised her hand, and waved at him.

"Mom!" Sebastian choked out, stepping forward, but a sharp pain shot through his foot.

Sebastian looked down and saw that he was barefoot, standing on thorny ground.

The thorns emerged from the soil, instantly surrounding him. Sebastian wanted to run, but the thorns pierced deeply into his flesh. Crimson droplets stained the stems and leaves, gracefully coursing along the verdant plant, blossoming into eerie yet exquisite flowers upon its sharp thorns.

"Sebastian." The voice continued to call him.

It sounded close to his ear, yet also far away.

Sebastian looked up, leaning forward, but he couldn't move an inch. He could only watch as the sea of thorns grew wildly, pulling him further and further away from Anna.

"Mom!" Sebastian roared and sat up in bed. His head felt like it had been hit with a hammer, extremely pained.

Sebastian covered his eyes with his hands, the veins on his eyelids throbbing with his pulse, as if they were going to tear him apart.

Jack opened the door and walked in. "Mr. Landon?"

Afraid the light would hurt Sebastian's eyes, Jack didn't turn on the lights. He just went over and opened the curtains a bit, letting some light in from outside.

Sebastian held his head for a long time before he could catch his breath.

Sebastian looked out the window. It was already dark, and the heavy clouds felt like a weight on his chest, making it hard to breathe.

He asked, "What time is it?"

Jack replied, "It's almost five o'clock. You slept quite deeply, about three hours."

Sebastian closed his eyes and picked up his phone, finding that Isabella had called him twice and sent three text messages.

He opened the messages, and the words came into view.

[Sebastian, are you off work?]

[I couldn't reach you, so I asked Jack. He said you were busy.]

[I'm so silly. I know you can't see, but I still can't help but text you.]

Sebastian read them all, marked them as unread, then got out of bed, grabbed his coat, and headed out. "Take me home."

"Yes, Mr. Landon." Jack said.

In the car, Sebastian called Isabella.

Almost as soon as the phone rang, Isabella answered, "Hello, Sebastian. Are you off work?"

Hearing her voice, Sebastian felt much calmer. "Yes. What are you doing?"

"Reading some documents." Isabella glanced at Laura on the opposite sofa, feeling a bit embarrassed as she got up and went to the balcony. "I learned a lot today."

"Really? Then I'll have to test you when I get back." Sebastian said.

"No problem, I'll accept your challenge," Isabella said with less confidence, "But don't ask anything too difficult. I read so much today, and I realized how hard business is."

Isabella had been a top student in school. Even if she wasn't the best, she was at least in the upper middle tier. She was diligent and willing to put in the time and effort, usually making her one of the top students.

But after reading the company's documents today, Isabella realized how hard it was to learn business.

And what Laura knew was just the basics.

Just getting a taste of it made Isabella realize how difficult it had been for Sebastian to build the Landon Group from scratch all these years.

"I won't," Sebastian said with a smile,"I'll ask something simple."

Isabella also smiled. "What are you doing now?"

"Just got in the car," Sebastian said, glancing ahead. "Returning home now."

Isabella volunteered, "Then I'll make dinner. What do you want to eat?"

"Anything. As long as it's made by Bella, I'll love it." Sebastian said.

"Then I'll start preparing. Tell Jack to drive slowly and give me more time." Isabella said.

"Okay." Sebastian said.

After hanging up, Isabella bought some ingredients.

Laura walked over. "It's getting late, and Mr. Landon should be back soon. I'll head out now."

Isabella stopped her. "I'm about to cook. If you go back now, you'll only have takeout. Why not stay and eat with us? After dinner, you can leave with Jack."

###chapter 251 Raw

Laura had arrived in the morning with Jack, coming straight from the office. Given that it was getting dark, the weather was bad, and this area wasn't the best for hailing a cab, Laura decided to stay. Whether or not Jack stayed for dinner, she could hitch a ride with him, so she agreed to help Isabella once the ingredients arrived.

Meanwhile, Sebastian had asked Jack to stop by a bakery after their call. Jack went inside to pick up a cake, then headed back to the car. Sebastian, still feeling a bit off, reclined in the back seat, eyes closed, trying to relax.

As they approached a red light, Jack's phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID and, without rushing to answer, turned to Sebastian. "Mr. Landon, it's Siena."

Sebastian opened his eyes.

The phone continued ringing, and Jack asked again, "Do you want me to answer it?"

Back at Isabella's place, Laura was helping her in the kitchen. To Laura's surprise, Isabella pulled out her phone and started searching for recipes online.

Laura's eyes widened. "Wait a minute, Isabella, you don't know how to cook?"

"I know a little,"Â Isabella admitted.

"A little? How little are we talking?"

"I can make salad,"Â Isabella said with a slight blush.

Laura was both amused and exasperated. "I thought you meant you were a pro. You had me convinced you'd be whipping up something amazing."

Isabella felt a twinge of embarrassment. "With my background, most people would expect me to know how to cook. But I don't."

Nina had always taken care of everything-cooking and laundry. Isabella never had to lift a finger. She had always thought of Nina as a towering figure of kindness, and when she learned they weren't blood relatives, that appreciation only deepened.

Isabella only knew how to make the salad, something she learned from her college roommates. Saying she would cook dinner was a spur-of-the-moment decision, one she now regretted slightly.

Determined not to disappoint Sebastian, who seemed to have some expectations, Isabella had impulsively bought the ingredients. But reality had set in, and she was facing the fact that her cooking skills were lacking.

She thought, 'Never mind. Just look up a recipe and follow it. I've seen Nina cook countless times. It can't be that hard if you just manage the heat and seasoning, right?'

Half an hour later, the dishes were on the table.

Laura and Isabella stared at the array of plates with a mix of confusion and trepidation.

After a moment, Laura finally asked, "Can we actually eat this?"

Isabella handed her a fork. "Hey, don't judge a book by its cover. The presentation might be off, but if it tastes alright, that's what matters."

This was Isabella's first attempt at cooking, and her standards weren't high-basically, if it was edible, she'd consider it a win.

Laura took a bite and immediately frowned, bending over to spit into the trash can. "Is this raw?"

Isabella followed suit, grimacing as she did. "The outside's burnt, and the inside's still raw.

Laura was at a loss for words.

After sampling all the dishes, it was clear that the only thing edible was the salad. The rest of the meal was a disaster.

Looking at the lone remaining salad on the table, Laura couldn't help but chuckle. "I'm actually kind of looking forward to seeing Mr. Landon's reaction when he walks in and sees this."

At this moment, the doorbell rang.

Isabella put down her fork. "I'll get it."

Laura, still laughing, said, "Mr. Landon's back."Â But then she puzzled. "Why would Mr. Landon ring his own doorbell?"

At the door, the sound of conversation reached them. When Laura opened it, she was surprised to see it wasn't Sebastian but a delivery person.

Isabella quickly cleared away her cooking disasters and set out to deliver food. With the addition of that salad, they now had a hearty and delicious dinner ready.

Laura clapped her hands in applause. "Well played, Isabella. I didn't realize you had a backup plan all along."

Isabella smiled, "I know my cooking skills are limited. I couldn't let you all starve after all that effort."

Laura snickered, "You know, you might have been onto something. Mr. Landon might actually prefer your cooking. After all, love makes people blind."

Isabella laughed. "True, love might make people blind, but I'd rather not subject him to that, would I?"

"Of course, Mrs. Landon. Whatever you say."

Laura's teasing made Isabella blush slightly.

"But it's pretty late. Why hasn't Mr. Landon come back yet?"Â Laura glanced at the clock.

Isabella followed her gaze to the wall clock and felt a pang of unease.

It should have taken Sebastian no more than forty minutes to get home from the office. It had already been over an hour and a half, and still, there was no sign of his car.

The house fell into a tense silence as Isabella and Laura exchanged worried glances, their unease growing with every passing second.

Given the current tense situation and the intense battle between Sebastian and Charles, there was always a worry that Charles might resort to desperate measures and orchestrate some kind of accident.

Isabella shook off her worries and pulled out her phone, dialing Sebastian's number.

The phone rang for a moment before Sebastian's voice came through. "Bella."

Hearing his voice eased Isabella's tense nerves. "Sebastian, where are you? Why aren't you home yet?"

"I've got an urgent matter to handle. I forgot to let you know."

Isabella felt a twinge of disappointment, but she quickly pushed it aside. She thought, 'Compared to an accident, this is nothing. As long as Sebastian is okay, work is work.'

"Will you still make it for dinner?"Â Isabella asked.

"It'll be a while longer. Go ahead and eat without me."

"Alright. Just be careful, and have Jack keep a close eye on you."

"Will do."

After hanging up, Isabella turned to Laura. "He's caught up with something and won't be back for dinner. We'll just eat ourselves."

Laura looked sympathetic. "And all the food you ordered?"

"He's missing out,"Â Isabella said, grabbing the utensils, "Let's dig in. No saving any for him."

Laura took a seat as well.

Isabella glanced at her phone and said, "It's hard to get a cab around here. How about I drive you home after we're done?"

Laura hesitated. "I think I'll wait for Jack to bring Mr. Landon back, then head home with him. There's no rush."

Isabella noticed Laura's tired expression and insisted on giving her a ride.

Laura finally relented.

In the garage, Isabella chose a white car and pulled it out. As she approached, she saw Laura standing on the steps, head bowed as she fiddled with her phone.

Laura looked up only when Isabella stopped the car in front of her. She quickly pressed her phone to her chest, her face flushed with a hint of guilt.

###chapter 252 It's Not Really a Breakup

Isabella blinked in surprise. "What's the matter?"

Laura slipped her phone into her bag. "Nothing, really."

She opened the passenger door and slid into the seat. "I'm sorry to trouble you with a ride at this hour. Just drop me off a bit further down the road where I can catch a cab."

Noticing Laura's uneasy demeanor, Isabella didn't press the issue. It was clear Laura preferred not to be dropped off directly at her home, and Isabella wasn't about to force the matter.

After driving a few miles out of the neighborhood, Isabella stopped and let Laura out. Within moments, a cab arrived as if on cue.

Isabella watched as Laura got in, and the cab pulled away before she turned around and headed back.

As she approached the neighborhood, Sebastian called her, asking if she was home yet.

Isabella was caught off guard and asked, "How did you know I wasn't at home?"

She hadn't mentioned her trip to drop off Laura.

Sebastian replied, "Laura filled me in."

Isabella remembered how Laura had looked when she was fiddling with her phone on the steps, her expression a mix of unease and guilt. It made sense now; Laura had probably been reporting to Jack or Sebastian.

Still, it seemed a bit excessive for Laura to report such a minor detail.

"Bella?"Â Sebastian's voice broke through her thoughts.

Snapping back to reality, Isabella glanced at the road ahead and said, "I'm almost home. Just a turn away."

"Okay."Â Sebastian's tone sounded more relaxed but still concerned. "Get some rest. You don't need to wait up for me."

"Will do."

As she hung up, Isabella had just driven into the neighborhood when her phone rang again.

Thinking it might be Sebastian calling back, she answered only to find it was Miley.

"Hey,"Â Isabella said.

"Bella, are you free right now?"Â Miley's voice was slurred, and the background noise was chaotic, hinting that she'd been drinking.

"Yeah, I'm free. What's up?"

"I'm feeling awful."

Thirty minutes later, Isabella arrived at the bar.

Entering the private room, she found Miley sprawled among a sea of empty bottles, completely out of it.

Isabella approached and gently shook her shoulder. "Miley?"

Isabella shook her for a while with no response.

Turning to the bartender who had led her in, Isabella asked, "How much has she had?"

The bartender glanced around at the scattered empty bottles and muttered, "That's about how much she drank."

Isabella looked around the room in dismay. "You realize drinking this much can be dangerous, right?"

The bartender's face paled, and he nervously pointed at Miley. "You don't think she's..."Â he swallowed hard before continuing, "Dead, do you?"

Isabella rolled her eyes.

Miley wasn't dead, but she was seriously drunk.

While she was known for holding her liquor from working in nightlife, seeing her in this state was a first for Isabella.

With the bartender's help, Isabella got Miley into a car and took her home. She settled Miley into the guest room and, exhausted, collapsed beside the bed, dozing off in a haze.

When she woke up, the sunlight was pouring in through the window.

Having slept awkwardly on the edge of the bed all night, Isabella felt her limbs were stiff and sore. She stretched slowly and looked up to find Miley's eyes watching her.

"I'm sorry, Isabella. Did I cause you trouble?"Â Miley's voice was weak, carrying a hint of regret.

Isabella pushed herself up, examining Miley's pallid face. "It was quite the hassle. When I found you last night, I thought you were dead."

Miley managed a tired smile. "It's not that easy to just... die."

There was a note of sadness in her words, prompting Isabella to ask gently, "Did you break up with Zaire?"

Miley lowered her gaze, hiding the pain in her eyes, and murmured, "It's not really a breakup."

Wanting to steer away from the sensitive topic, Isabella suggested, "How about I order some food? What do you feel like eating?"

"Macaroni and cheese."

"No need to order that,"Â Isabella said with a reassuring smile, "I can make macaroni and cheese myself."Â She gestured toward the bathroom. "Why don't you freshen up? I'll grab you a fresh set of clothes and then we can head downstairs for breakfast."

"Okay."

Isabella left the guest room and headed back to the master bedroom.

She pushed open the door only to find the room empty. The bed was neatly made, showing no signs that it had been used.

It was clear that Sebastian hadn't come back last night.

As Isabella descended the stairs, she dialed his number.

Just as the phone rang, the front door swung open.

Jack was helping Sebastian inside, both of them looking exhausted.

Isabella rushed over. "Why are you only getting back now?"

Before she could say more, Sebastian pulled her into a tight embrace.

Isabella stiffened in surprise, then caught a whiff of something metallic-blood.

She looked down, sniffing at Sebastian's shirt, and confirmed the smell was indeed blood.

Alarmed, she pushed Sebastian away slightly and examined him closely. "Sebastian, you're hurt. Where are you injured? How did this happen? Was it Charles? Was it..."

Before she could finish, Sebastian pulled her back into his arms, pressing his lips against hers in a passionate kiss.

Jack, sensing the need for privacy, turned and left the house.

Sebastian's kiss was intense, leaving Isabella breathless. She tried to push him away, her hands clenched in fists against his chest, but she didn't have the strength to move him.

Finally, Sebastian released her but kept her tightly in his embrace.

Isabella gasped for air, her fingers exploring his body as she looked up at him, desperate. "Where are you hurt?"

Her voice trembled, edged with tears.

Sebastian gently cupped her face with his hand. "Don't worry, I'm not hurt."

"Then why..."Â she started to say, but then noticed a dark red stain on Sebastian's sleeve.

Isabella grabbed his sleeve with both hands. "This is blood!"

"It's not mine,"Â Sebastian quickly reassured her.

"Whose is it?"Â Isabella's relief was tempered by confusion.

She glanced at Jack, who looked fine. She thought, 'If it isn't Sebastian's or Jack's blood, then whose is it?'

"It's someone else's,"Â Sebastian replied.

The vague answer didn't satisfy Isabella. "Who else?"

Sebastian hesitated for a moment before saying, "Last night, on our way back, we came across a pregnant woman. Jack and I took her to the hospital and stayed there all night."

Isabella sighed. "No wonder you're only back now. Is the woman okay?"

"She's fine."

"And the baby? Is the baby alright too?"

Even though she hadn't seen the woman or the situation firsthand, Isabella, having given birth herself, understood the fear and pain involved.

Sebastian noticed her trembling, a flicker of something complex crossing his face.

"Bella."

###chapter 253 Join the Fun

Isabella could sense Sebastian was holding something back, but when she waited for him to speak, he remained silent. As she looked up at him, he gently ran his hand through her hair and said, "I'm a bit tired. I'd like to go upstairs and rest."

"I'll take you up,"Â Isabella offered.

She helped him up the stairs, and once they reached the bed, Sebastian practically collapsed onto it, pulling Isabella down with him.

His arms wrapped around her waist, and with a gentle lift, Isabella found herself pressed firmly against him.

"Sebastian?"Â Isabella murmured, noticing his deep, tired breathing.

"Hmm?"Â Sebastian's eyes remained closed, exhaustion evident in his voice.

Isabella shifted in his arms, gazing at his face. Seeing him so drained, she felt a pang of sympathy. "Sebastian, are you really that tired?"

Sebastian's eyelashes fluttered, but he didn't open his eyes. In a sleepy murmur, he responded, "Yeah."

"Then go ahead and sleep. I'll make us breakfast."Â Isabella propped herself up and placed a soft kiss on the bridge of his nose.

As she tried to get up, Sebastian tightened his grip, pulling her back into his embrace.

Sebastian opened his eyes slightly, leaning over her with a hoarse voice. "Bella, don't go."

"But"Â Isabella began to protest, only to be silenced by his kiss.

Something seemed off about Sebastian's mood.

Though he didn't say anything, Isabella could sense that something was troubling him.

After their intimate moment, Sebastian fell into a deep sleep, still holding Isabella close.

Isabella felt tired but couldn't shake the wakefulness from her mind. Sleep seemed elusive.

Through the door, Miley's voice called out, "Bella, I'm leaving now."

Isabella wanted to respond, but the sound of footsteps fading away indicated Miley had already left.

Once the villa fell silent again, Isabella felt drowsy and soon drifted into a restless sleep.

As Miley stepped outside, a familiar car pulled up.

She paid it no mind and didn't break stride, her eyes briefly scanning the vehicle as she walked in her high heels.

The car stopped right in front of her, and Zaire stepped out. "Did you spend the night here?"

Miley smirked. Without makeup, she appeared less sharp and more vulnerably feminine than usual. "Yes, is there a problem with that?"

Zaire's gaze turned icy as he scrutinized her for a moment before striding over and grabbing her arm, pulling her towards the car.

Miley didn't resist but remarked coolly, "Mr. Jose, did you just come from Miss Anderson's place?"

Zaire halted abruptly, turning to face her.

Miley met his eyes with a bright, almost mocking smile. "From the look on your face, it seems you wasn't quite satisfied. Did Miss Anderson fall short of your expectations?"

Zaire's frustration boiled over. He glared at her for a long moment before slamming the car door shut with a thud.

Then, gripping Miley's neck, he pressed her against the car and covered her lips with a fierce kiss.

Miley didn't resist; instead, she played along enthusiastically, her fingers slipping expertly under his shirt, teasing him.

Zaire let out a low groan before pulling away, irritated. "You're a girl, for heaven's sake. It's broad daylight-don't you have any decency?"

Miley laughed softly. "Mr. Jose, you're so predictable. You're the one who started this mess. Am I not allowed to fight back?"

As she spoke, her grip tightened.

Zaire yanked open the car door and pushed Miley inside, then drove off towards the hotel.

The drive was a blur of speed, and as they entered the hotel and got into the elevator, Zaire's lips were on hers again.

Their passionate kisses and entangled bodies continued as they made their way to their usual suite.

"Zaire?"Â A soft, hesitant voice suddenly cut through the moment.

Zaire's ardor immediately cooled.

He turned around, and Miley followed his gaze. Both of their eyes landed on Susan, who was standing by the suite's door.

Susan was dressed to the nines, her diamond-encrusted bag sparkling. Despite her glamorous appearance, she looked awkward and out of place, seeing them locked in an embrace.

She took a step forward, looking at Zaire. "You told me to come here today."

Zaire's eyes narrowed. He thought, 'When did I ever say that?'

A soft laugh tickled his ear, and he glanced back to see Miley's grin. His brow furrowed in irritation.

Miley's arm still draped over his shoulder, and she rubbed her long leg against his pants, her voice sultry. "Mr. Jose, are you trying to juggle two of us?"

Zaire pressed his lips together, his displeasure evident.

He thought, 'When did I ever say I wanted to play this way?'

"I don't mind at all,"Â Miley purred. "It's just a matter of whether Miss Anderson is okay with it?"

Susan remained silent, her lips tightly pressed. Her gaze was fixed on Zaire.

Since the beginning, Zaire had barely acknowledged Susan, his attention almost entirely on Miley. Now, with Miley's crude comments, Susan couldn't believe Zaire could tolerate this.

Susan had always thought of Zaire as a man of romantic ideals. Once upon a time, a mere hint from her would have had him trailing after her eagerly. Even though things had changed and there were now many barriers between them, she still believed her allure was unmatched.

She didn't see Miley as a serious contender.

Susan expected Zaire to push Miley away.

But Zaire chuckled lightly, pulling Miley closer as he kissed her again right in front of Susan.

Miley didn't hold back, seizing the moment to respond to Zaire with equal fervor.

Their kiss was intense, oblivious to anyone around them, filled with unrestrained passion.

The sounds of their lips and mingled saliva were anything but discreet.

Susan stood frozen, watching this spectacle with her face gradually twisting into an expression of hurt.

As the door to the suite started to close, Susan's blood boiled. She dashed forward, slamming her hand against the door. "Zaire!"

Zaire paused, turning to look at her with a lewd grin. "What's up? Want to join the fun?"

Susan stood there, stunned.

Having lived abroad, she was quite open-minded and had even engaged in threesomes and group activities in the past. But once she came back home, things were different.

Especially in front of Zaire, she had a reputation to uphold.

Susan cast a glance at Miley, who was nestled in Zaire's arms, breathing heavily. A flicker of distaste crossed her face. "Zaire, I really do have something important to discuss with you."

"Sorry, I'm pretty tied up at the moment,"Â Zaire replied, his gaze fixed on her, "You can wait out here or come in and wait. Your call."

Susan felt a numbness in her fingers. After a moment's hesitation, she finally let go of the door.

Watching it close before her, Susan bit down hard on her lip, the sting quickly filling her mouth with the taste of blood.

###chapter 254 Having Nightmares

As soon as the door slammed shut, Zaire seemed frozen, remaining unmoved for a long moment.

Miley, watching him, felt a pang of unease. She cupped his face in her hands and, with a teasing smile, said, "Mr. Jose, can't bear to let Miss Anderson go? Maybe you should invite her in to join us?"

Zaire's breath quickened. He gripped her waist tightly, his fingers digging in as he snapped, "Do you think she's like you?"

"What's wrong with being like me?"Â Miley laughed, a hint of triumph in her voice. "If she were like me, at least you'd be satisfied. Instead, you spent the whole night with her and then came running back to me, hungry for more the next morning."

Zaire pressed against her, gritting his teeth. "I'm only saying this once. We were together last night, but nothing happened."

Miley's expression faltered, a flicker of something softening in her eyes.

She chuckled a couple of times, her laughter laced with a touch of smugness.

Zaire felt the shift and, frustrated, gave her a rough shove. "You did that on purpose, didn't you?"

Miley snorted softly, her arms sliding around his broad shoulders. "That's on you, Mr. Jose. I didn't say a word."

Zaire snorted in reply and carried Miley to the bed.

Afterward, he went for a quick shower.

When Zaire emerged, Miley was still lounging on the bed, looking lazy and listless. Her long, slender arm draped over the covers, and the marks of their earlier intimacy stood out sharply on her smooth shoulder.

Zaire walked over and sat at the edge of the bed, reaching out to touch her shoulder. "Do you want me to carry you to the shower?"

Miley flashed a smile and opened her arms. "Sure, a cuddle would be nice."

Just as Zaire bent to lift her, a voice suddenly called from outside the door, "Oh, Ms. Miller, what's the matter?"

A flurry of activity erupted outside.

Zaire's breath caught. Without a second thought, he abandoned Miley, grabbed some clothes, and dashed out.

Miley was left alone, sinking back onto the bed.

She listened to the commotion outside until it faded away, but Zaire didn't return.

Isabella was jolted awake by the sound of running water. She opened her eyes to see Sebastian showering in the bathroom.

She had slept soundly, feeling refreshed and in good spirits.

When the water stopped, Isabella got up from the bed, intending to take a shower herself.

At that moment, her attention was drawn to her phone on the bedside table, which buzzed twice.

Initially thinking it was her phone, Isabella picked it up, only to realize it was Sebastian's phone.

Knowing his password, she unlocked it and checked the notifications.

There was a text from an unfamiliar number, accompanied by two messages: a photo and a text.

The image showed a cake, with a slender hand in the lower right corner, the back of which had an IV needle inserted. The sleeve was unmistakably from a hospital gown.

The text message was brief: [The cake was delicious. Thank you.]

The cake had some writing on it, but the piece had been cut in such a way that it was hard to read, and the photo angle wasn't much help either.

As Isabella was about to zoom in to get a better look, a hand suddenly reached over and snatched the phone from her grasp.

Startled, Isabella exclaimed, "Sebastian, when did you get out?"

Sebastian had silently appeared behind her. She hadn't heard his footsteps at all, and his presence was so unobtrusive that she hadn't noticed him.

Sebastian turned off the phone's screen. "Who sent the message?"

"I don't know, it's from an unlisted number."Â Isabella replied, then frowned, "How did you know I was looking at your phone?"

In her mind, Sebastian was unable to see. Isabella stared at his eyes, which were as vacant as ever.

She thought, 'Clearly, Sebastian can't see, so how has he managed to grab the phone so accurately?'

"I heard the phone buzz twice and then the sound of the keys being pressed. So, I reached out in that direction. Sorry, Bella, I didn't realize you were looking at my phone,"Â Sebastian explained, then put the phone down and gently took Isabella's hand. "Did I hurt you?"

Sebastian's cautious demeanor tugged at Isabella's heartstrings.

"I'm fine,"Â Isabella reassured him.

Sebastian seemed relieved and took the phone again, handing it back to Isabella. "I can't see it. Can you check who sent the message?"

Isabella glanced at the screen once more and read out the number.

"No name attached? I don't recognize this number,"Â Sebastian said, frowning. "What's the message about?"

"It's a photo of a cake and a text saying the cake was delicious. Thank you,"Â Isabella reported, looking up at Sebastian.

Sebastian frowned in thought for a moment before taking the phone. "It's probably a wrong number. Don't worry about it."

A flicker of doubt crossed Isabella's mind, but she had just been reassured by Laura earlier that day, and she didn't want to let this minor issue make her suspicious of Sebastian. Besides, if there was something amiss, the sender would likely have called Sebastian directly rather than texting someone visually impaired.

So, Isabella decided to let it go and quickly pushed the incident out of her mind.

On the edge of the city, in a secluded mountain area, a white villa nestled quietly among the trees, surrounded by the dense silence of the forest.

The mist in the mountains was thicker than in the city, flowing like liquid milk when the wind blew. Veils of mist drifted through the half-open window.

Nina, lying in bed, shivered in her sleep, her eyes darting rapidly. Rather than waking, she sank deeper into her dream.

The heart-wrenching cries of a woman seemed to echo from miles away.

Under the dilapidated eaves, a woman lay in a dirty corner, her legs spread wide on the water-stained brown floor. She trembled violently, her bulging belly indicating that a tiny, living being was slowly making its way out of her body. The scene was both shocking and tragic.

"Nina, Nina?"Â A man's voice cut through abruptly.

Nina jolted awake, gasping for breath, her body drenched in cold sweat.

As she focused on the person in front of her, her anxiety melted away. She clung to Richard, drawing comfort from his warmth as if his presence could pull her out of the nightmare.

Richard tightened his strong arms around her. "You're being unusually forward. It's a bit overwhelming."

Nina buried her face in his shoulder, still disoriented, her mind buzzing from the remnants of the dream.

When her breathing finally steadied, Richard gently pulled her away, cradling her shoulders. He looked deeply into her eyes and asked, "You're having nightmares even when I'm right here, am I not providing you with enough security?"

Nina shook her head. Once she had calmed down, she only felt a mild ache in her head. She raised her hand to rub her temples and said, "I don't know why I had such a dream."

Richard took her hand away and began to massage her temples with his own. Though his hands were usually accustomed to wielding tools and weapons, they were remarkably gentle now, as if he feared even a slight pressure might break her. So he was careful, applying just a light touch.

"What kind of dream was it? Tell me about it,"Â Richard urged.

Nina swallowed hard, her gaze distant. "I dreamed about Vanessa."

###chapter 255 Have a Baby with Me

"Vanessa?"Â Richard said the name calmly, "Who's that?"

Nina was taken aback by his poor memory. After all, it was Richard's team that had tracked down Charlie and Vanessa in the first place. Without Richard's help, catching Charlie would have been much harder.

Seeing her expression, Richard looked genuinely puzzled. "I don't usually bother remembering names of people who don't matter to me."

Nina sighed. "Do you remember Charlie?"

"Charlie?"Â Richard's face darkened immediately. "Are you still hung up on your dead ex-husband?"

Nina was at a loss for words. Richard's logic was baffling.

Before she could explain, Richard added with a hint of hurt, "If he's still on your mind, he must have had some qualities worth remembering. If that's the case, I'll try to work on them."

Nina couldn't help but laugh at his comment. "It's not like that."

Richard's expression grew serious as he looked at her.

Nina sighed and said, "Vanessa was the woman who got involved with Charlie. She used to work for Sebastian's company and pretended to be Bella in order to marry Sebastian. When she was exposed, she was furious and sought revenge on Bella by messing around with Charlie. Does that ring a bell?"

With Nina's detailed explanation, Richard remembered her now, though he was still puzzled and irritated. "So why on earth are you dreaming about that troublemaker?"

Richard's sharp tongue was as biting as ever.

"I don't know."Â Nina shook her head. "I actually dreamt about her giving birth."

Richard paused, then leaned closer, pinning Nina against the headboard. His voice was hoarse as he asked, "Do you want to have a baby?"

Nina thought, 'When have I ever said that?'

Richard's hands were already slipping under her clothing, caressing her skin. "Nina, do you want to have a baby with me?"

Nina pushed him away. "Stop joking around."

"I'm not joking."Â Richard paused, his eyes locking onto hers with intense seriousness. "I'm being serious."

Nina's cheeks flushed as she felt her heart race under his gaze.

"Do you have any concerns?"Â Richard continued, his hands exploring her body. "Is one baby not enough?"

Nina only heard the first part of his question and instinctively responded.

She did have concerns.

Truth be told, she was still hazy on how she and Richard had come this far. Initially, she had been scared-afraid that Richard might reject her because of her past marriage and its failures.

But Richard had shown nothing but care and affection, without a hint of disdain or mistreatment.

As they spent more time together, it was hard not to be moved by his treatment of her.

She thought, 'Just as I'm beginning to adjust to our relationship, why is the topic of having a baby coming up so suddenly?'

Richard chuckled. "If one isn't enough, let's have two. If two isn't enough, we can go for three. We're still young-if you want to have a baby, I can support it."

Nina stared at him, puzzled. "That's not what I meant."

Richard kissed her gently. "Silly, one is enough. I wouldn't want you to go through that kind of pain."

"But I..."

Nina's words were cut off by Richard's kiss.

After their intimate moment, Nina fell asleep in Richard's arms.

Richard's fingers toyed with her hair for a while before he reached for his cigarette case. Just as he was about to light up, he glanced down at Nina, who curled up in his arms.

Nina detested smoking men. Since being with her, Richard had already cut back significantly.

As long as Nina was around, Richard refrained from smoking.

And given their recent discussion about having a baby, if they were to really go ahead with it, he definitely couldn't let her be exposed to smoke. Not at all!

Without hesitation, Richard tossed the cigarette and lighter into the trash can.

He then picked up his phone and dialed Michael.

"Hello, Richard!"

"Michael, check on Vanessa's current whereabouts."

Even though it was just a dream, seeing Nina like that still made him uneasy.

To Richard, Vanessa seemed like a non-issue, but considering her past involvement with Charlie, she likely left a significant mark on Nina.

He wanted to make sure Vanessa was no longer a threat before he could relax.

Michael fell silent on the other end, clearly racking his brain trying to recall who Vanessa was.

Finally, he asked for clarification.

Richard frowned in irritation. "You're young-how can you have such a poor memory?"

Michael replied, "Richard, I genuinely can't remember. Could you give me a hint?"

Richard glanced down at Nina and whispered, "Sebastian's ex-girlfriend."

"Got it, the one who was involved with Charlie?"

Richard ground his teeth, his voice turning cold. "If you remember now, go investigate. No more talking."

With that, he ended the call.

Michael was left dumbfounded.

He thought, 'Richard is angry.

'But why is he so mad?'

Michael realized with a chuckle and a shake of his head. "Richard, so you can be wrapped around a woman's finger too?"

"Michael, the food is here."

Michael put down his phone and went to eat.

When he left the restaurant, he donned his helmet and mounted his black motorcycle.

As he started the motorcycle, one of his men suddenly called out, "Michael, it's Ms. Jose!"

Michael glanced back, and sure enough, he saw Kelsey standing at the door of the sandwich shop.

Kelsey's attire and demeanor did not fit in with the casual ambiance of the street cafÃ©; she stood out like a sore thumb.

Kelsey's sweet voice carried over on the breeze, causing Michael to squint.

One of the men cheekily asked, "Michael, how about we go say hi?"

He received a swift kick in response.

Just then, Kelsey finished her purchase and turned, her gaze sweeping in this direction.

Michael pulled back his foot, snapped his helmet into place, and roared past Kelsey on his bike.

The men followed suit, and they all sped away.

Even though they had gone quite a distance, the sound of the motorcycle still reached her ears.

Kelsey stood there, holding her breakfast, staring in that direction, lost in thought.

The sandwich shop owner said, "Young people these days are too flashy; they're not learning the right things and are always disturbing people with their motorcycles. They don't look like good kids."

Kelsey turned to her, saying, "Just because someone rides a motorcycle doesn't mean they're bad; do good people have signs written on their faces? How can you judge someone by their appearance?"

The owner looked puzzled.

Kelsey continued, "I know those people; they're nothing like what you described. I don't want these sandwiches, give me my money back."

The owner was even more confused.

###chapter 256 Jumped Down

Kelsey bought breakfast from a different place and headed over to Jack's house, carefully covering the peephole on the door.

When Jack opened the door and saw her standing there, he paused for a second before starting to close it.

Kelsey hurriedly reached out, and the door pinched her hand.

She let out a sharp cry as the breakfast she was holding hit the floor.

Jack quickly reopened the door, pulling Kelsey inside and immediately checking her hand.

Her slender fingers were marked with a clear red line from where the door had pinched her, and it looked like it really hurt.

"Does it hurt?" Jack asked, his voice filled with concern.

Kelsey bit her lip and nodded. "Yes, it hurts. It's killing me."

Her high-pitched tone left Jack at a loss, unsure of what to do.

He released her hand. "Let me get the first-aid kit."

As he went inside, Kelsey stepped into his small but tidy apartment. The space was compact but neatly organized, with a few pots of flowers on the balcony.

When Jack returned with the first-aid kit, he found Kelsey bent over, inspecting his plants.

His gaze dropped, and he noticed she was barefoot on the floor.

Jack set the kit down and went to fetch a pair of clean slippers.

"Here, put these on. You don't want to catch a cold."

Kelsey turned and noticed Jack's eyes were fixed on her feet.

She instinctively pulled her feet closer.

Realizing his mistake, Jack quickly averted his gaze, his ears turning pink.

Kelsey noticed and slipped her feet into the oversized gray slippers, which felt loose and made her walk awkwardly.

Jack had already opened the first-aid kit and was rummaging through it. "Come here, let me put some antiseptic on that."

"Okay,"Â Kelsey said, moving to sit on the stool across from him.

"Give me your hand."

"Sure."

Kelsey extended her hand, resting it in his palm. Her eyes remained glued to him, but Jack avoided looking up, his focus fixed on the task at hand.

Kelsey's heart felt like it was coated in honey as she was savoring the moment.

After a while, Jack finished and released her hand. "All done."

Kelsey, still not entirely satisfied, asked, "That's it?"

Jack was silent for a moment as he packed away the first-aid kit. "What made you come over here?"

"I brought you breakfast,"Â Kelsey replied.

Jack hesitated before asking, "There's breakfast at the office."

"That's not the same,"Â Kelsey said, nudging the stool closer to Jack, "I bought this myself. How can it be the same as what you get at the office?"

Jack didn't have a retort.

Seeing Jack's silence, Kelsey took advantage, shuffling the stool even closer until she was almost pressing up against him.

"Jack."

"Hmm?"

"Why won't you look at me?"

"There's nothing to see,"Â Jack replied, his voice low and uncomfortable.

"Then why don't you take a look?"Â Kelsey prodded, her tone teasing.

Jack stiffened momentarily before slowly turning his head to meet her gaze.

In that instant, it felt like fireworks exploded around him. Kelsey's face was so close that it was almost within his reach.

"Do I look good?"Â Kelsey asked, her voice soft and inviting.

Jack's Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard. "You look good."

"Do you like me?"

The warmth in Jack's ears felt like a tiny fire, spreading quickly, turning his whole face red.

"Jack, I like you,"Â Kelsey said boldly, seizing the moment, "Would you be willing to go out with me?"

Jack froze, then forced a smile. "Ms. Jose, don't joke around."

"I'm not joking!"

Jack suddenly stood up. "I need to put away the first-aid kit."

Kelsey stood, too, grabbing his hand and pressing it against her chest.

Jack looked startled, his eyes wide as he watched her.

"Jack, listen to my heartbeat,"Â Kelsey said, inching closer until her feet nearly touched his. They were so close that their breaths mingled. "I'm serious. If you feel even the tiniest bit of affection for me, could you try to overcome your insecurities and give us a chance?"

Her sincerity was like a blazing flame, almost consuming him.

Jack's heartbeat quickened, but he fought to keep his composure. Finally, he lowered his gaze and spoke softly, "Ms. Jose, I'm sorry, but I don't have feelings for you."

He tried to pull his hand away, but Kelsey clung to it, her eyes burning with determination. "I don't believe it. Unless you let me hear your heartbeat!"

She tried to move closer, wanting to press her ear against his chest to hear his heartbeat.

But Jack pushed her away.

Kelsey stumbled back, her face showing hurt.

Jack met her gaze briefly before looking away. "Please, go."

Once he had spoken, Jack carried the first-aid kit into the bedroom.

Sounds came from outside, as if Kelsey had really left.

Jack placed the kit and took a moment to compose himself before leaving the bedroom.

The sight that greeted him made his heart skip a beat. There, perched on the window sill of the balcony, was Kelsey.

She hadn't left; the sounds were from her opening the window and climbing up.

The wind howled through the open window, Kelsey gripping the window sill, watching him quietly.

Jack's expression hardened. "Kelsey, what are you doing? Get down now!"Â He took a step towards the window.

Kelsey smiled at him, then, as he took a stride closer, she let go and plummeted from the window.

Jack opened his mouth, but no sound came out. As he watched Kelsey fall, he felt his heart leap out of his chest with her.

Without a moment's hesitation, Jack climbed onto the windowsill, stepping out into the air after her.

As he leaped, the view unfolded below him. He seemed to see a large crowd below and an inflatable mattress.

Two thuds echoed around.

Jack landed on the mattress, wasted no time in getting up, and rushed to check on Kelsey.

Kelsey lay in the center of the mattress, eyes shut, unmoving.

"Ms. Jose?"Â Jack patted Kelsey's face gently, but she didn't respond.

The crowd buzzed with talk. Jack, usually so calm and composed, lost his rationality, picking Kelsey up. "Someone call an ambulance, now!"

###chapter 257 I Can Give Up Everything

"Ambulance, call an ambulance!" Jack screamed at the top of his lungs.

But no one around did as Jack said; instead, they started pointing and whispering.

"Why would someone so young want to die for love?"

"I heard it's because the guy was irresponsible, so the girl couldn't take it and wanted to jump."

"He looks so refined, like an educated person. How could he do something so shameless?"

"Such a good girl, why did she have to fall for this guy?"

"Maybe he has someone else outside. Otherwise, why wouldn't he want such a good girl?"

Listening to these words, Jack felt as if he were on the verge of losing his mind.

"It's not like that. Shut up! All of you shut up!" Jack shouted.

But those people didn't listen to him at all and continued their gossip. The chaotic remarks were unbearable.

Jack tried to carry Kelsey away, but they blocked his path.

"Come clean! Do you have someone else outside?"

"Did you get another woman pregnant? How could you hurt such a good girl? Are you even human?"

"She jumped for you. Why don't you tell the truth?"

"Or maybe this girl isn't a good person either, and you caught her cheating?"

"Birds of a feather flock together. I don't think this girl is good either."

Jack was about to go mad. He shouted, "No, she's a good girl. It's me. I'm not good enough for her!

"I come from a humble background; we're not from the same world. How could I drag her into the mud?"

Jack thought that by mercilessly driving Kelsey away, everything would be fine, but he didn't expect Kelsey to jump!

"Are you regretting it now?"

"If you had another chance, would you still drive her away?"

Jack cried bitterly. "No, I wouldn't."

Jack clutched Kelsey tightly, his chest heaving with an anguish he'd never felt before. Waves of pain surged from deep within his heart, as if it were trying to tear him apart.

As Jack sobbed uncontrollably, he glanced down and saw Kelsey grinning up at him.

Jack wiped away his tears, trying to clear his vision.

Kelsey was alive.

Right there in his arms, she was laughing and wriggling with joy.

Jack was stunned.

Kelsey reached up, wrapped her arms around his neck, and planted a kiss on his lips. "Here's your chance, but no cheating!"

The crowd erupted in applause. The same people who had earlier berated Jack were now beaming with smiles, surrounding him and Kelsey with congratulations and cheers.

Jack watched, realization dawning on him.

It was all a setup. Kelsey had staged the entire scene!

And she was enjoying it the most.

Snapping out of his daze, Jack pushed Kelsey away and started to walk back.

Kelsey's voice called out from behind him. "Jack, aren't you afraid I'll really jump this time?"

Jack didn't turn around or stop.

Kelsey stomped her foot in frustration. "If I jump again, it'll be for real. You'll regret it, but there won't be a second chance!"

Jack took a few more steps but finally halted.

He turned around and walked back toward Kelsey.

Standing in front of her, Jack stared at her, catching his breath. Then, bending down, he swept her up in his arms and carried her home.

Kelsey was momentarily stunned but quickly wrapped her arms around his neck, waving to the crowd below. "Thanks, everyone! I'll make sure to pay you all later!"

Another round of applause erupted behind them.

Once they were home, Jack carried Kelsey into the bedroom and laid her down on his bed. He then pulled the curtains shut.

After completing these tasks, Jack returned to the bed and pressed Kelsey into the covers, kissing her with a fervor that seemed almost frantic.

Kelsey responded with equal passion.

"Why go through all this craziness?"Â Jack asked, his eyes locked onto Kelsey's in the dim light.

Kelsey bit her lip, looking a bit hurt. "If I hadn't done this, would you have held me like this? Kissed me like this? Agreed to be with me?"

Jack's heart ached as he gently traced his fingers down Kelsey's nose. "You're a fool."

Kelsey grasped his fingers tightly; her voice was soft yet insistent. "Jack, will you be with me? I promise I'll take care of you."

It was heart-wrenching to see her plead like this, so vulnerable.

Jack kissed her forehead and the tip of her nose. "Are you sure about this? I don't have much to offer."

"I'm sure,"Â Kelsey replied, her hand sliding around his waist. "Everything you don't have, I do. I can give up anything, as long as I have you."

A fire ignited in Jack's eyes. He gripped Kelsey's chin and kissed her passionately.

Just as they were about to dive deeper into their moment, Kelsey suddenly felt a heavy, damp sensation in her lower abdomen.

Her eyes flew open, wide with fear.

"What's wrong?"Â Jack asked, concerned.

Kelsey bit her lip, her face flushing crimson. "I think my period just started."

Jack, being single and unprepared, didn't have any sanitary products at home. He hurried out to buy some.

Worried that Jack might not pick the right brand, Kelsey texted him a few brands she commonly used, even specifying the length. She then sat patiently on the toilet in Jack's bathroom, waiting for him to return.

While she waited, her phone rang. It was Margaret.

Kelsey took a deep breath before answering. "Hi, Mom."

"Kelsey, Nina and Mr. Cole are coming over for dinner today. Where are you?"

"I'm at a friend's place."

"When will you be back?"

Kelsey thought for a moment before replying, "I won't be home for lunch. I'm having it with my friend, so don't wait for me."

"A friend? Who, Bella?"Â Margaret asked. "Nina's already called her. Bella and Sebastian are coming over too."

"Not Isabella."

"Not Isabella? Then who?"Â Margaret was puzzled. She knew Kelsey well enough to understand that before working at the Landon Group, Kelsey had no friends. She thought, 'Isabella is her first, so who is this new friend?'

Kelsey fumbled for words. "Mom, don't ask. I'm not a kid anymore."

"Even if you're not a kid, you shouldn't be making dubious friends,"Â Margaret said, her concern growing. The more evasive Kelsey was, the more worried Margaret became. Her thoughts drifted to Richard.

Margaret and Steven had reservations about Richard and Nina's relationship, even though Margaret didn't know all the details. She had an inkling that Richard's activities weren't above board.

Yet, considering the suffering Nina had endured, especially with Charlie, Richard was a balm for her wounds.

Margaret's anxiety spiked. "You're not with that Michael, are you?"

###chapter 258 I Will Try My Best

"Mom, what are you talking about?" Kelsey frowned. "I'm not with Michael, and even if I were, it's not like we're fooling around."Kelsey said.

"Kelsey, I'm warning you, don't hang out with that Michael !" Margaret, usually gentle, was more serious now.

The Jose family had always been strict about their family values. Steven had learned this lesson the hard way in his younger years. As a result, he conducted his business with utmost propriety, avoiding any association with shady characters, even if it meant sacrificing potential profits.

Zaire and Kelsey were also taught from a young age not to associate with bad kids at school.

Kelsey still remembered when Zaire was in school, he once got into a gang fight. When Steven found out, he chased Zaire with a stick for a long distance.

Since Kelsey was a girl, Margaret was even more particular about this. Any students with eccentric attire and appearance were strictly off-limits for Kelsey to associate with.

When Kelsey was in school, she was always picked up and dropped off by car, living a pampered and well-behaved life.

Kelsey understood the reasoning completely, yet hearing this still made Kelsey feel slightly uncomfortable. "Mom," she remarked, "why do you sound just like the sandwich shop lady?"

"What sandwich shop lady?" Margaret was confused. "What did I say?"

'You all judge people by their appearance,' Kelsey thought.

"Oh, don't worry, I'm really not with Michael. If you don't believe me, you can ask Richard." Kelsey said.

Margaret was still not reassured and gave her a strict order, "I don't care where you are. You must come back for lunch!"

"But Mom..."Kelsey was interrupted because the call was abruptly ended on the other end.

Meanwhile, at the supermarket below the neighborhood, Jack had searched everywhere but couldn't find the brands of sanitary pads Kelsey wanted.The sales associate, seeing Jack wandering around with no clue, approached him for help. "Sir, can I assist you with anything? Maybe I can help?"

Jack handed over his phone. "Do you have any of these brands of sanitary pads?"

The sales associate glanced at the screen, his expression one of surprise as he looked Jack up and down. "Sir, we don't carry these brands, and I've never even seen them before."

Jack felt a bit awkward. "Alright, then just get me the most expensive ones you have, in the lengths I need."

"We can do that,"Â the sales associate replied, quickly sorting out the products according to the specified lengths.

After paying, Jack left the store and checked several international shopping apps to see if he could find the brands Kelsey had mentioned.

No luck.

Returning home with the items, Jack heard Kelsey's voice from the bathroom as he walked in. "Jack, is that you?"

Jack answered and made his way over, carrying the bags.

He knocked on the bathroom door and slipped the items through the gap. "The brands you wanted, they weren't available at the store."

Kelsey rummaged through the bags. "No way. The ones I asked for are really common."

Jack stood outside the door. "Are you sure they're common?"

"Absolutely,"Â Kelsey responded without hesitation. "When I visit other people's homes, their hosts use pretty much the same ones."

Mid-sentence, she suddenly realized something.

Typically, those who interacted closely with the Jose family were of similar status, so their lifestyle standards were also comparable. For families like theirs, the products used by women were not the kind one find in ordinary supermarkets. They were made by specialized companies and sold directly to them.

If Jack could find them at the local store, it would be quite a surprise!

Kelsey slapped her forehead in realization. In her haste, she hadn't considered this detail.

"It's fine,"Â she said, "They're all pretty similar, so any of these will work."

With that, she opened a package and took care of herself.

When Kelsey opened the door, she saw Jack standing there, absorbed in his phone, seemingly unaware of her approach.

Kelsey glanced at the phone screen, noticing Jack was searching for the brands she used. The search results, however, were unhelpful.

"Jack,"Â Kelsey said, gently tapping his shoulder.

Jack looked up, putting his phone away. "Done?"

"Yep,"Â Kelsey nodded and then rubbed her stomach. "I'm hungry. I haven't had breakfast yet."

When Kelsey's breakfast got splattered as she entered the door, she was less than pleased.

Jack took her hand gently. "How about we go out to eat?"

Kelsey rubbed her stomach, looking uncomfortable. "I'm not feeling great right now. I don't have the energy to go anywhere. Do you have anything ready to eat at home?"

"Yes,"Â Jack replied, leading her to the kitchen, "What would you like?"

Kelsey casually asked, "Do you have any Macaroni and cheese? I've been craving it."

Jack rummaged through a cabinet and pulled out a bag of Macaroni and cheese. "Yep, here it is."

Kelsey glanced at it and raised an eyebrow. "Instant kind?"

Jack hesitated, gripping the bag a little tighter. "If you don't mind, I could order some takeout?"

Kelsey realized her mistake and quickly said, "No, it's fine. I've never tried this kind before. Let's go with this."

Jack's eyes softened with a hint of amusement. "Alright. I'll cook it, and you can relax on the couch."

As he turned to start cooking, Kelsey wrapped her arms around him from behind. "I want to keep you company."

Jack chuckled softly, "Okay."

Instant meals were all about convenience. From cooking to serving, it took less than twenty minutes. Soon enough, they had two steaming plates of Macaroni and cheese.

Kelsey took a bite and smiled broadly. "Mmm, this is really good. I like it."

Jack looked at her, a bit conflicted. "This is usually what I rely on for a quick fix. Next time, I'll take you to a proper restaurant."

Kelsey shook her head, "You don't need to go out of your way. I actually like this. It's pretty tasty."

Jack ate in silence, focusing on his meal.

Kelsey reached out and placed her hand gently on his. "Jack, I'm easy to please. My mom used to say I was like a pig-just give me something to eat and I'm happy."

Jack took her hand in his, squeezing it firmly. "I'm going to work hard to give you the best I can."

Kelsey nodded, her face lighting up with a smile. "I believe in you, and I'll work hard alongside you!"

Her smile seemed to brighten the room, chasing away the shadows and letting the sunshine in.

At the Jose family residence.

When Isabella and Sebastian arrived, Nina and Richard greeted them warmly.

"Nina."

"Bella."Â Nina took her hand, concern in her eyes. "Why are you driving today? Where's Jack?"

###chapter 259 Too Preoccupied

"Jack took a day off," Isabella said with a smile, leaning close to Nina's ear. "He's with Kelsey."

Nina blinked in surprise. "Really? No wonder Mom said Kelsey was acting weird today. She claimed she was at a friend's house, but when asked which friend, she couldn't give a clear answer. Turns out she's with Jack."

Isabella nodded. "I heard it when Jack was asking Sebastian for leave."

Nina took her hand and walked inside. "I need to tell Mom later so she won't worry."

"Okay."Isabella replied.

Isabella and Nina walked into the house hand in hand, leaving the two men standing silently in the yard.

Richard frowned and looked back at Sebastian, his gaze lingering on Sebastian's eyes for two seconds. "Looks like you don't need me to help you inside?"

Sebastian's eyes shifted. "Mr. Cole, you're quite sharp."

His acting could fool many, but Richard saw through him instantly.

This Richard, truly lived up to being Bruno's right-hand man.

Richard chuckled lightly. "But aren't you worried that deceiving Isabella like this will cause trouble if she finds out?"

Sebastian remained calm as he looked towards the gate. "Certain matters must be kept from her; the more she knows, the greater the peril she faces."

Richard glanced at him again. "Is it just for her safety?"

Sebastian met his gaze.

The two men stared at each other, neither speaking.

Just then, Zaire strolled out of the house, eyeing the group with a hint of exasperation. "Are you two planning to just stand out here and dry out like raisins?"

Richard finally looked away from Mr. Landon. "Just catching up with Mr. Landon."

Sebastian returned to his blank stare. "Don't slander me. I have no interest in emotional bonding with men."

Zaire just rolled his eyes in response.

Everyone took their seats.

The lunch spread was impressive, with Richard and Nina, Isabella and Sebastian paired off at the table.

Seeing the cozy setup, Margaret noticed Zaire alone and found it rather awkward. She nudged him with her foot and whispered, "Where's Miley? I haven't seen her in days. Why didn't you bring her along?"

Zaire shrugged. "She's busy."

Isabella, having overheard, looked up. "Actually, Miley called me on the way here. She mentioned she was free today and was hoping to hang out. I told her we'd be here for lunch and invited her."

As Isabella finished her sentence, Zaire shot her a sharp glance.

Margaret quickly understood the situation. She put down her fork and said, "I'll give her a call and see if she can come over for a bite."

Before Margaret could get up, the sound of a car engine filled the yard.

Moments later, a servant came in with a smile, "Mrs. Jose, Miss Harper has arrived."

Isabella added, "I told her we were having lunch here and that she should join us. She said she hadn't seen Margaret in a while and was happy to drop by."

Margaret smiled approvingly, "Perfect. Please, show Miss Harper in."

Margaret then asked the servant to set an extra place at the table.

Seeing Zaire still sitting there with his indifferent expression, Margaret gave his leg another nudge.

Zaire jolted. "Mom?"

Margaret shot him a look. "Are you going to just sit there?"

He thought, 'Well, what am I he supposed to do? Stand? Or lie down?'

Just then, Miley walked in.

"Margaret."

Zaire's gaze lingered on Miley for a moment, and he couldn't help but be taken aback by her appearance.

Miley was stunning, and her outfit was on point. Even when she didn't put much effort into her appearance, she was already a head-turner. Today, however, she had clearly gone the extra mile. Her white dress was a far cry from her usual style, and instead of her usual high heels, she was wearing stylish flats.

Margaret admired her with satisfaction. "Miley looks absolutely lovely today. She's a perfect match for our Zaire."

Margaret pulled Miley over and practically planted her next to Zaire, looking more and more pleased with the pairing as she did.

Zaire barely touched his food before making an excuse about a phone call and standing up to leave.

As he reached the door, he glanced back at Miley. "Come with me for a moment."

Margaret shot him a disapproving look and held onto Miley's hand. "Why would she go with you? Let her stay here and chat with me. Business calls are always so dull."

Miley nodded eagerly, "Sure thing, Margaret. I'm happy to stay and talk."

Zaire stood there for a moment, his frustration mounting as no one paid him any attention.

Feeling out of place, he turned and left.

Isabella watched the scene unfold with a smirk.

Sebastian, noticing her amusement, leaned in and asked quietly, "What's going on?"

Isabella shook her head with a chuckle. "Nothing much."

After lunch, Sebastian mentioned he had work to handle, and since Jack was out, Margaret insisted Isabella stay. The Jose family's driver took Sebastian to the Landon Group.

Meanwhile, the women settled in the living room to chat. Richard, finding himself out of place in their conversation, joined Steven in the study for some male bonding.

Margaret had the servant brew a pot of coffee, and the women moved to a quieter room to enjoy their drinks and conversation.

Somehow, the discussion shifted to the Landon family.

"Bella, how are things with you and Sebastian? Any new issues with Charles?"Â Nina, ever the worrywart, couldn't help but ask her usual questions whenever they met.

Isabella replied, "Everything's fine so far."

Margaret pondered for a moment before saying, "Charles is probably too preoccupied with his own problems lately."

Her tone hinted that there might be trouble in the Landon family.

Isabella pressed, "What do you mean? Is something happening with them?"

Margaret explained, "I'm not entirely sure of the details, but from what I've heard from some of our mutual friends, there's talk of Charles having an affair. Emma's been inquiring about houses in Mosterwania through a friend. Rumor has it they might be heading for a divorce."

Isabella was taken aback. "Is this reliable?"

She thought, 'Charles, at his age, still causing trouble? And why is Emma looking into Mosterwania properties? Could she be planning an exit strategy?'

The whole situation seemed bizarre to Isabella, but Margaret didn't have any more details.

Isabella decided to keep this news in mind and plan to discuss it with Sebastian later that evening.

Outside, the sound of a car engine caught her attention. Looking through the window, she saw it was the driver returning from dropping Sebastian off.

Margaret opened the window to inquire, and the driver explained, "I ran into Mr. Landon's private doctor, Marvin, right after I left. Marvin took Mr. Landon to the office, so I was sent back."

Isabella thought, 'Marvin? What a coincidence.'

But given that Marvin was Sebastian's private doctor, just like Jack's presence, she felt reassured. With Marvin looking after Sebastian, he'd be in good hands.

Isabella got up and said, "I'm going to use the restroom."

As she entered and closed the bathroom door, her phone buzzed.

###chapter 260 Anxiety

She initially thought it was Sebastian calling. When she took out her phone, she found that it was an unknown number without a contact name.

Isabella answered, "Hello."

"Isabella, it's me." Leo said.

Isabella said nothing and hung up immediately.

Leo didn't call back, but a few seconds later, he sent a picture.

Isabella glanced at her phone and saw a picture of Sebastian's car's rear end. The angle suggested that Leo was tailing him.

Panic set in immediately. Isabella dialed Sebastian's number, but all she heard was a cold, mechanical voice. "The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."

She redialed several times, but the message remained the same.

Just as she was about to lose hope, her phone buzzed again.

She looked at the number and hit the answer button; Leo's voice came through. "Don't panic, Isabella. I'm not going to do anything to a blind man."

Isabella gripped her phone tightly. "Leo, what do you want?"

"Nothing much. Just not in the best of moods and thought I'd see you."

"Are you out of your mind? You actually think I'd agree to meet you?"Â Isabella's tone was one of incredulity.

Leo's voice was calm and almost conciliatory. "Without knowing Sebastian's secret, I doubt you wouldN'T."Isabella was taken aback for a moment, then quickly realized this might be a trap. She sneered, "You think I'm going to fall for your tricks?"

"No worries. I'll give you time to think. I'll be waiting outside the Jose family's place for the next half hour. If you don't show up, you'll never find out Sebastian's secret."

With that, Leo ended the call.

Isabella stared at her phone, her disdain clear.

She'd been deceived too many times before. This time, she wasn't going to fall for it.

But her concern for Sebastian's safety kept her on edge. For the next half hour, Isabella repeatedly tried to call Sebastian, but his phone seemed to be off, with no way to get through.

The longer time dragged on, the more restless Isabella became.

"Bella, what's wrong?"Â Nina noticed her unease and turned to ask.

Isabella was far from calm.

She could stay clear-headed and not be deceived, but she couldn't gamble with Sebastian's life. If Leo really did something crazy, she'd never forgive herself.

She couldn't just sit idly by either.

Isabella stood up. "Nina, can I borrow a car?"

"A car?"Â Nina and Margaret exchanged concerned glances. "Where are you going?"

Margaret moved closer, her concern evident. "You don't look well. Is something wrong?"

"No,"Â Isabella said, trying not to alarm them, "Sebastian's phone isn't working, and I'm worried. I'm going to check on him at the Landon Group."

"Oh, I see,"Â Nina said, visibly relieved. "Hold on a second, I'll grab the car keys."

Minutes later, Isabella drove away from the Jose family estate.

She kept a close eye on her rearview mirror as she left the gated community. Sure enough, not long after, she saw Leo's car trailing her.

The drive from the Jose family estate to the Landon Group took about forty minutes. Throughout the journey, Leo's car followed at a steady pace.

When Isabella pulled into the Landon Group parking lot, Leo's car did not follow her in.

She parked quickly and headed straight for the elevator.

As soon as she arrived at the executive office, Laura spotted her. "Isabella, what are you doing here?"

"I'm looking for Sebastian. Is he in the office?"

"Mr. Landon? He's not in the office today,"Â Laura said, looking puzzled.

"That can't be right!"Â Isabella's heart skipped a beat. "He left before I did, so he should have been here at least twenty minutes ago."

"Really? Let's check the office. I might have missed him."

Laura led Isabella to Sebastian's office. They pushed open the door, and the office was empty. They even checked the break room, but Sebastian was nowhere to be found.

"Did he really not come to the office today?"Â Isabella asked.

Laura shook her head. "Dr. Finn is Mr. Landon's private physician. Aside from Mr. Landon, only Jack can usually get in touch with him."

"Call Jack!"Â Isabella pulled out her phone and dialed immediately.

When Jack answered, he told Isabella to stay calm while he contacted Marvin.

A few minutes later, Jack called back. "Marvin's phone is also off, but don't worry. I'm going to go look for him."

Isabella's anxiety was through the roof. She was practically losing her mind!

Jack gave Laura some instructions, making sure she kept an eye on Isabella and not let her run off.

Isabella's mind raced as she tried to hold on to her composure, knowing that every minute counted.

Laura settled Isabella in Sebastian's office and made her a cup of coffee. "Isabella, don't worry. Jack's out looking for Seb; he probably knows where Mr. Landon is. Just sit here for a bit, and I'll come back to keep you company once I finish up."

Isabella seemed lost, barely registering Laura's words as she sat there, visibly anxious.

Laura, having other tasks to attend to, left the office.

Meanwhile, Jack hung up the phone and headed to the hospital with Kelsey.

It wasn't Jack's idea to bring Kelsey; she had insisted on coming along as soon as she heard about Sebastian. Jack had reluctantly agreed to bring her.

As soon as they parked, Kelsey unfastened her seatbelt and started to get out, but Jack firmly held her back.

"Stay in the car,"Â he said.

Kelsey looked at him, confused and worried. "Why? Is Sebastian seriously hurt? What's going on? I need to come with you!"

"Listen, Kelsey Jose!"Â Jack's tone was stern.

Kelsey flinched, her anxiety mounting. "What's wrong?"

"Mr. Landon is fine. He's not hurt. He's just here for a check-up, and I'm here to make sure he's actually here. As long as he's here and okay, we can reassure Isabella. The rest of it is none of our concern."

Kelsey was puzzled. "What rest?"

"I can't explain everything to you. Kelsey, as Mr. Landon's assistant, I don't get involved in his personal affairs, and neither should you."Â Jack placed a firm hand on Kelsey's shoulders, his expression serious. "Let me check things out. If everything's fine, I'll take you to see a movie."

Kelsey was quiet for a moment. Finally, she nodded, realizing she didn't want to push him further. "Okay."

Jack let go of her, got out of the car, and locked the doors before heading inside.

Kelsey watched him walk away, feeling restless. She tried the car door but found it locked. With no other option, she resigned herself to waiting inside.

Once Laura finished her tasks, she grabbed some snacks and headed back to the office, only to find it empty when she pushed the door open.

Startled, she quickly called Jack.

At that moment, Jack had just pushed open the hospital room door. He answered Laura's call to hear her panicked voice on the other end. "Mr. Brown, there's a problem-Isabella is missing!"

###chapter 261 You Never Disappoint with Your Responses

At the hospital, Sebastian and Marvin both turned their heads simultaneously.

Jack, speaking into his phone, then walked over to them. "Mr. Landon, Isabella is missing."

Sebastian's face tightened. "What's going on?"

Jack said, "I'm not sure of the details. About ten minutes ago, Laura called me. Isabella came to the office to find you but couldn't get through. I tried Marvin's number too, but no luck."

"Can't get through? My phone is working fine,"Â Marvin said, pulling out his own phone. His voice trailed off as he noticed, "Actually, there's no reception at all."

Sebastian checked his phone as well and found the same issue.

Just then, the call between Jack and Laura was cut off, replaced by a series of beeps indicating a dead line.

Jack glanced at his phone. "Mine's lost reception too."

A heavy silence fell over the three men.

Sebastian gave a nod, and Jack and Marvin immediately began searching the room.

"Mr. Landon, we found something,"Â Jack called out.

Following Jack's voice, Sebastian and Marvin saw a reception jammer in the cabinet. It was blocking all communication reception within the room-effectively cutting them off from the outside world.

Sebastian took a quick glance at Siena, who was lying in bed. "Who's been here?"

Siena looked at the jammer, bewildered. When Sebastian asked, she finally snapped back to reality. "Charles."

"When did he come?"Â Sebastian asked, his tone showing no surprise, almost as if he expected it. His voice was cool and detached.

"Last night,"Â Siena replied. "I was just about to tell you, but he arrived before I had the chance."

Siena meant Jack.

Sebastian was silent for a moment before instructing, "Jack, put the jammer back where you found it."

"Yes, sir,"Â Jack replied, doing as instructed and returning the jammer to the cabinet.

After the task was done, Sebastian turned to leave.

Siena called out urgently, "Sebastian, when can I be discharged?"

Sebastian paused and answered, "Tonight."

"Tonight?"Â Siena was taken aback.

Sebastian continued, "Tonight he'll come to get you. Let him take you home."

Siena's eyes flickered with understanding. "Alright."

At the Landon Group, surveillance footage revealed that Isabella had arrived directly from the basement parking lot.

However, when she left, she didn't return to the basement but went straight to the ground floor and exited through the main entrance.

The footage at the entrance clearly showed Isabella walking out of the Landon Group, pausing briefly, then approaching a car. She opened the door, got in, and the car drove away.

As the car hit the city roads, it started to speed up noticeably.

Isabella tightened her seatbelt and turned to Leo. "Leo, where are you taking me?"

Leo glanced at her briefly without responding and instead accelerated, merging onto the highway.

They drove on the highway for about two hours, aimlessly circling around with no apparent destination.

"Leo, where exactly is Sebastian?"Â Isabella asked for the sixteenth time.

Earlier, Leo had always brushed off her questions with a smile. But this time, he merely lifted his chin towards the right.

Isabella looked in that direction. The car passed by a lake. The afternoon sun, now softer at around 4:30 PM, cast a warm golden glow on the lake's surface.

"Pretty, isn't it?"Â Leo's voice came from beside her.

Isabella took a quick glance before averting her eyes. "It's blinding."

Leo chuckled. "You never disappoint with your responses."

Isabella shot him a look. "You're no better."

Leo raised an eyebrow.

Isabella added, "Always avoiding anything serious!"

Leo shook his head with a resigned smile. "You're right. I do have a knack for doing things my own way."

With that, he suddenly jerked the steering wheel to the right.

The car veered off the city highway, exiting onto a small, winding road. After about ten minutes of driving, they rounded a bend and were greeted by an expansive open space.

Leo parked the car in the middle of the field, where the sunlight was so intense it was almost blinding.

Isabella shielded her eyes with her hand while Leo had already hopped out and leaned against the hood of the car.

After a moment's hesitation, Isabella followed suit and stepped out.

She surveyed the area and noticed the desolation of the place; the wind carried a sense of emptiness.

"Leo, what's this all about?"Â Isabella asked, keeping her distance.

"Watching the sunset."

Isabella could only stare at him in disbelief.

Leo ignored her, moving to the back of the car and popping the trunk to start unloading supplies.

Isabella's patience wore thin. She pulled out her phone to call Sebastian, only to find there was no reception-her calls wouldn't go through.

As she held her phone up, searching for a signal, Leo walked by with an armful of gear. "Don't bother looking. There aren't any cell towers around here."

Isabella's eyes widened in realization. "You did this on purpose?"

"Finally catching on?"Â Leo's laughter echoed in the open field.

Isabella was speechless.

She watched as Leo continued to unload a camping setup, complete with chairs, a table, and an assortment of food and drinks.

Fuming, Isabella approached him. "So all this about Sebastian's secrets, including that photo you took, was just a ruse? Your whole plan was to get me here to watch the sunset?"

"Not entirely,"Â Leo said seriously, "The photo is real, and Sebastian does have secrets. You got one part right-I did deliberately bring you here."

"Why?"Â Isabella asked, deeply offended by what she saw as Leo's underhanded tactics.

"Wait a minute,"Â Leo said, his focus completely absorbed in his own train of thought, disregarding Isabella's anger.

After telling her to wait, he darted back to the trunk for more supplies.

Isabella, exasperated, kicked over a nearby chair in frustration.

Footsteps approached from behind, and Leo's voice called out, "Isabella. Could you help me with..."

"Leo, are you done yet?"Â Isabella snapped, turning around and swatting the items from his hands.

One of the items landed at her feet.

Looking down, Isabella discovered it was a birthday cake.

###chapter 262 Birthday

That was a very small cake.

The cake boasted minimal decoration, adorned solely with plain white cream. Its singular embellishment was a lone birthday candle placed on top.

At this moment, the candle was crookedly stuck in the smashed cake, looking both pitiful and ridiculous.

Leo's expression froze for a second, and he murmured, "Today is my birthday."

Isabella froze for a second but quickly reacted, "Leo, stop pretending to be pitiful in front of me. Your birthday has nothing to do with me. Bringing me here forcefully constitutes abduction and is a criminal offense; I can press charges against you."

In her mind, this Leo, akin to Charles, never uttered a word of truth; their every action was a tapestry of deceit.

She wouldn't sympathize with Leo, not even a bit.

Leo, however, squatted down, scraped a piece of the cake with his hand, and tasted it. "The cake is sweet."

Isabella was speechless.

Leo looked up at her again. "I originally bought it for you to try. What a pity."

Isabella stared at Leo for a while, then walked away.

She got into the car and started looking for the car keys.

She refused to remain in the company of that madman, Leo!

"Are you looking for this?" Leo asked.

Isabella looked up, and Leo was standing in front of the car, one hand in his pocket and the other raised high, with a car key dangling from his finger.

Isabella got out of the car to grab it, but how could Leo possibly give it to her so easily?

Leo instead grabbed Isabella's wrist and pulled her over."Isabella, you had ruined my birthday cake. Shouldn't you compensate me?"

Isabella couldn't hold back anymore and cursed through gritted teeth, "Leo, you lunatic!"

Leo, instead of getting angry, smiled and said, "You're right. I am a lunatic."

He dangled the car key in front of her. "Want the car key?"

Isabella reached out to grab it.

But in the next second, Leo swung his hand back.

The car key drew a beautiful arc in the air and fell straight down the cliff.

Isabella's breath hitched. She broke free from Leo's hand and ran towards the cliff.

Pebbles rolled down the cliff as she kicked them. Just as she was about to rush down, Leo grabbed her waist from behind, and he pulled her away from the dangerous area.

"Lunatic, let go of me!" Isabella struggled.

Leo pressed her onto a chair, securing her. "If you want the key, spend this birthday with me."

Isabella's eyes turned red. "You are dreaming!"

She slapped Leo and got up to walk back the way she came.

She thought, 'If I can't drive back, I will walk. As long as I get to the main road, I can definitely hitch a ride.'

This time, Leo didn't stop her; he just stood there, calling her name over and over again.

"Isabella!"

"Isabella!"

Isabella never looked back. The more Leo called, the faster she walked. She only wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

Seeing that Isabella was really about to walk away, Leo punched the car hood hard. "Isabella, do you still want the evidence of Charles' crimes?"

As expected, Isabella stopped.

But she didn't walk back. She stood far away, looking at Leo.

She was doubting Leo's words. After all, Leo was a habitual liar.

"Come back," Leo said, "Spend this birthday with me, and I'll give you the evidence of Charles' crimes."

Isabella was reluctant to trust Leo, but her desperation for evidence against Charles made her hesitate. She knew that only with proof could Sebastian free himself from the clutches of his monstrous father.

As the sun dipped lower, casting a golden hue over everything, Leo stood there, his features shrouded in the fading light. At that moment, Isabella found herself feeling oddly sorry for him.

She took a few steps forward, and with each step, Leo's face came into clearer view. By the time she reached him, he greeted her with a smile. "I knew you'd come back."

Isabella's frown returned, and her fleeting sympathy vanished. "Leo, are you serious about this? Will you really help me get evidence on Charles?"

"It all depends on how you play it."

With that, Leo turned away, but Isabella had barely started moving when he pulled her back.

"I meant what I said. I won't go back on my word."

She withdrew her hand and took a seat. The cake was gone, leaving only some juice and snacks behind.

Leo picked up a candle from the remnants of the cake and fished out a lighter. He tried to light it, but the strong wind on the cliff extinguished the flame almost immediately.

Undeterred, he struck the lighter again.

With the car windows tightly sealed, the candle finally stayed lit, casting a steady glow.

Leo grinned. "See? It's lit now."

Isabella rolled her eyes. She thought, 'Seriously, how could someone his age be so childish?'

He held the candle out to her with a particularly earnest expression. "As a favor, could you sing me a birthday song?"

Isabella's face was expressionless. "Sorry, I don't sing."

It wasn't that she couldn't sing; she simply refused to. Leo's birthday was already a farce in her eyes. The only reason she was sticking around was because he might be useful to her. Otherwise, she'd have been long gone by now.

Leo wasn't bothered. He started singing the birthday song to himself, his off-key voice echoing through the car.

Isabella couldn't help but be annoyed.

After finishing the song, Leo said, "Can you hold the candle for me, Isabella? I'd like to make a wish."

Isabella hesitated for a moment but eventually extended her hand to hold the candle.

Leo clasped his hands together, closed his eyes, and made his wish with an exaggerated sense of reverence.

One minute passed.

Two minutes ticked by.

As the wax began to build up on Isabella's fingers, Leo was still going strong.

Unable to bear it any longer, Isabella spoke up. "Are you making a wish or falling asleep?"

She hoped he wasn't about to drop dead on her.

Leo opened his eyes. "Done."

He then blew out the candle.

Just as Isabella was about to pull her hand away, Leo grabbed it tightly.

"What are you doing?" Isabella's reaction was sharp as she tried to pull her hand back.

"Don't move!" Leo held on firmly, pulling out a few wet wipes from the glove compartment and gently wiping the wax off her fingers.

"I can handle it," Isabella said, pulling her hand away and grabbing a couple of wipes to clean her hands herself.

###chapter 263 Tracking

The setting sun cast a golden glow across the entire sky, and the mountains were shrouded in layers of hazy light.

The sunset was indeed beautiful.

As the last ray of light dipped below the horizon, stars began to twinkle in the sky, and the wind among the mountains and forests subsided.

Such a quiet environment was a great remedy for the soul. Even though Isabella disliked Leo, she couldn't deny that at this moment, she felt relaxed.

"Here you are." Leo handed over a glass of juice.

Isabella glanced at it. "I'm not thirsty. Thanks."

Leo knew what she was wary of and didn't insist. He took the glass back and drank the juice himself. Looking into the distance, he said in a low voice, "Thank you for spending my birthday with me, Isabella."

Isabella wasn't in the mood for sentimentality. "When will you give me the evidence of Charles' crimes?"

Leo glanced at her. "I don't know."

Isabella gritted her teeth. "Leo, you know lying on your birthday will get you struck by lightning and sent straight to hell, right?"

Leo raised an eyebrow. "Is there such a saying?"

Of course, Isabella had made it up to scare him.

Isabella continued, "You promised me, so don't go back on your word."

"Don't worry," Leo said, "Even if I betray everyone else, I won't go back on my word to you. But Charles is being very cautious; I need an opportunity to act."

Isabella thought for a moment and said, "Maybe I can help?"

Leo looked at her.

Isabella continued, "Emma called me earlier, asking me to visit Matthew in the hospital, but I refused. She tried to contact me again, and I blocked her. If I use this to strike a bargain with Emma, seeking her assistance in dealing with Charles, perhaps our chances of success might increase."

Leo sneered. "They are a couple, and from what I've observed, Emma is actually very afraid of Charles. Even for Matthew, I don't think she would go that far."

After all, Emma currently relied on Charles, and if Charles fell, it wouldn't benefit her either.

Isabella thought of what Margaret had said and tentatively asked, "Do you know that Emma has been inquiring about property prices in Mosterwania?"

Leo didn't speak but squinted at her.

From Leo's expression, Isabella guessed that he knew about it. So she continued, "I heard that Charles has been cheating on Emma and has another woman outside. I think their relationship has long been strained. So, the most important person to Emma is her son, Matthew."

Leo pondered for a moment. Just as he was about to say something, they heard a noise from the path behind them. Several cars approached, and the headlights shone brightly on them.

Leo glanced at it and said to Isabella, "Sebastian is here to pick you up."

Isabella stood up to leave but was pulled back by Leo.

Isabella turned around, and Leo smiled at her. "Can you wish me a happy birthday?"

At this moment, Leo seemed to be pleading.

Isabella struggled internally for a moment. She softly said, "Happy birthday, Leo."

"Thank you." Leo let go of her hand.

At almost the same moment, Isabella was pulled away by another force.

Sebastian wrapped his arms around her and coldly ordered, "Jack, take him away."

"Got it," Jack replied, leading a few bodyguards who quickly restrained Leo and escorted him into a car.

Isabella turned to Sebastian, bewildered. "Sebastian, what's going on?"

"He's suspected of human trafficking. Don't worry, I'm just sending him where he needs to go."

She thought 'Where he needs to go?'

Isabella wanted to ask more, but Sebastian cut her off, ushering her into the car and driving off.

The car sped through the night, the engine roaring.

In the backseat, Sebastian held her hand tightly while leaning back with his eyes closed, as if lost in thought.

Isabella stared at him, wanting to say something but unsure where to start.

When they got home, the evening passed with little more than washing up and settling in.

Isabella tried a few times to talk, beginning with, "Sebastian..."

But each time, Sebastian interrupted her.

It was clear he didn't want to discuss or hear any explanations about the night's events.Past midnight, the hospital room remained eerily silent. Siena, feeling disheartened, had just settled into bed when the door swung open.

She sat up quickly. "Mr. Landon?"

Charles tossed his coat to her. "Put this on and come with me."

Isabella, troubled by the night's events, had been sleeping lightly. So, when Sebastian got up, she noticed immediately.

At first, she thought he was just heading to the bathroom, but soon, she heard the door closing behind him.

Wide awake now, Isabella didn't bother with her coat. She followed him out.

As she reached the stairs, she saw a beam of light streaking through the glass.

Peering through the floor-to-ceiling windows, she watched Sebastian's car drive away.

By the time Isabella reached the front door, the car had already vanished from sight.

The night was as thick as ink, silence enveloping everything around. Isabella felt a deep unease and, without thinking, bolted out of the villa.

But her legs were no match for the speed of a car, and she stood alone in the quiet night, directionless.

Just then, another vehicle pulled up and stopped right in front of her.

A head popped out of the window. "Isabella, get in!"

Isabella hesitated for a moment, then quickly rounded the front of the car and slid into the passenger seat.

"Seatbelt!" came the urgent command.

Isabella buckled up swiftly.

"Hold on."

As soon as the words left her lips, the car roared to life and sped towards the exit of the neighborhood.

It wasn't until the car hit the paved road that Isabella finally realized what was happening. She turned to the driver, her eyes wide. "Kelsey, what's going on?"

"Don't ask why I'm here or where we're going. I don't know any more than you do. I'm just waiting for the truth to reveal itself," Kelsey replied, her eyes constantly darting to the dashboard screen.

Isabella followed her gaze and saw that the screen was showing a satellite map. A red dot blinked steadily on the map, and it was moving forward.

"So, you're tracking them?" Isabella asked, now understanding the situation.

"Yep." Kelsey's hands gripped the steering wheel tightly, her expression serious.

"Are you tracking Sebastian?" Isabella asked, uncertain, struggling to understand why Kelsey would be following Sebastian.

Kelsey frowned. "No, I was tracking Jack. Didn't expect him to pick up Sebastian along the way."

As they approached a traffic light, Kelsey stopped the car and turned to Isabella. "Isabella, you're curious too, aren't you? About what they're up to at this hour?"

Isabella couldn't find words.

She was indeed desperate to know, but at that moment, she had to admit that Kelsey was one step ahead. Kelsey even knew to put a tracker on Jack.

Otherwise, with so many intersections, they'd have been left in the dust long ago.

###chapter 264 Reviving in Someone Else's Body

Thereafter, Isabella refrained from disturbing Kelsey while she drove.

Kelsey kept her eyes fixed on the red dots on the map display, and it wasn't until they entered the Northhaven area that Isabella began to sense that something was amiss.

Isabella thought, 'This is the road to Northhaven!

'So, Jack and Sebastian are planning to drive to that piece of land in Northhaven at this late hour?

'That land now belongs to Charles, and the project has already started; it should still be in the construction phase.

'What is Sebastian doing there in the middle of the night?'

A growing cloud of doubt began to envelop Isabella's mind.

Finally, the red dot stopped.

Kelsey didn't dare to follow too closely and parked the car about 150 feet away.

Turning off the engine, Kelsey turned off the engine and took a flashlight from the glove compartment. Then they got out of the car and walked over in the dark.

It had rained a couple of days ago, and the surroundings were muddy. Kelsey was fine, but Isabella had rushed out in her pajamas and slippers. Her feet quickly got so dirty.

Fortunately, they managed to sneak into the construction site.

They walked along the main road, and after a short distance, they heard the sound of a car behind them.

Isabella pulled Kelsey into the bushes by the roadside, and the car drove straight past them and went ahead.

"This feels like some shady deal in the middle of the night," Kelsey said, standing up and brushing off the water droplets.

But Isabella stood there, staring in the direction the car had disappeared, her expression serious.

The surroundings were eerie, and Kelsey felt scared. She moved closer to Isabella and whispered, "Bella, what's wrong? Don't scare me."

Isabella grabbed her hand. "Let's go!"

They had barely taken a few steps when Isabella started running.

Kelsey, both shocked and scared, broke into a cold sweat but didn't dare to stop. She clung tightly to Isabella's hand and ran with her.

After rounding a sharp bend, they finally saw a white building ahead.

It was a castle with just its framework set up, dark and dilapidated, standing like a giant exuding a creepy aura.

The car they had seen earlier was parked in the open space in front of the white building.

When Isabella and Kelsey walked over, the car was already empty.

Isabella was about to step into the white building when Kelsey pulled her back with a terrified grip. "Bella, it's eerie in there, let's not go in. I'm scared," Kelsey stuttered.

Isabella gave her a look and said, "Wait for me here."

She then turned and walked into the building alone.

Kelsey, standing rooted to the ground with fear, decided she might as well follow Isabella. She stomped her foot and rushed inside.

"Bella, wait for me," Kelsey pleaded, hanging on to Isabella's arm tightly. She dared not turn on the flashlight, relying only on the faint moonlight that seeped in through the windows, feeling her way forward.

Suddenly, a piercing scream echoed from ahead.

Kelsey's body jolted, freezing solid, with Isabella holding her up.

Isabella stiffened at the sound and then hurried forward.

Lost without Isabella's support, Kelsey crumpled to the ground.

As Isabella's figure started to fade away, Kelsey looked around, steeled her nerves, and stood up again, running towards her.

Together, they ascended the stairs, following the faint light, accompanied by murmuring sounds.

Isabella and Kelsey exchanged a glance, and Kelsey, with one hand over her mouth to stop herself from screaming, her expression a picture of stark terror.

This was far more thrilling than any haunted house she had been to!

They inched closer to the light, about to find a spot to hide, when suddenly, a hand reached out from the side and tapped Kelsey's shoulder.

Already on edge, Kelsey, whose nerves were stretched to the limit, let out a sharp scream at the sudden touch.

Isabella sensed something amiss; when she turned, she saw two more figures.

"Jack, Marvin?"

Jack had one arm around Kelsey and was covering her mouth and nose with his other hand, muffling her cries.

Kelsey's face turned bright red from the effort of holding back her screams, tears streaming down her cheeks.

She was purely terrified.

Jack let go and pulled her into his arms. Kelsey clung to him, biting her lip hard, determined not to make a sound, though the aftershock took some time to fade, and she shivered violently.

Isabella asked Marvin, "Where's Sebastian?"

Marvin yanked Isabella and Kelsey toward a corner. "Mr. Landon will be here soon. What are you two doing here?"

Isabella and Kelsey exchanged glances. The situation with the stalker couldn't be explained in a few sentences, so Isabella said, "We followed Sebastian here."

Suddenly, a sound like an explosion came from the direction of the flickering flames.

Isabella looked in that direction, and her eyes widened in horror.

She thought, 'What on earth is that?'

In the empty space, two chairs were placed side by side. One chair held a young girl who seemed to have been drugged or knocked out, slumped lifelessly against the chair. The other chair held a skeleton, eerily white.

The chairs were positioned in front of a table, and a figure dressed as a mage was pacing around them, eyes half-closed, muttering incantations.

It was like a scene straight out of a horror movie, unfolding vividly before Isabella's eyes.

The mage completed several circuits and then threw something towards the candleholder.

The white powder ignited with a loud explosion.

Isabella stared at the scene, struggling to make sense of it. She turned to Marvin and Jack, asking, "What is he doing?"

Marvin and Jack exchanged a hesitant glance, seemingly debating whether to reveal the truth.

But with Isabella already here, there was no point in hiding it.

Marvin finally said, "He's trying to resurrect someone using another's body."

"What?"Â Isabella's shock was palpable.

Kelsey, who had been shivering uncontrollably, was clinging to Jack, forcing herself to steady her nerves. Upon hearing this, she froze for a moment before her shivering intensified.

She could barely handle a scary movie, let alone this!

After a brief shock, Isabella turned her gaze back to the two chairs.

The explosion must have been loud enough to wake the young girl, who now had her eyes open. However, she was too weak to move, slumped in the chair without the strength to even struggle.

Isabella then looked at the skeleton, and suddenly it hit her. She realized the horrifying truth as the explosive light from the mage's ritual seemed to burst into her mind.

"Could that be Sebastian's mother's remains?"

###chapter 265 Absurd and Ridiculous

Marvin didn't respond.

Jack pressed his lips and remained silent.

Isabella was utterly shocked.

This land was snatched by Charles from Sebastian, and it was Charles who buried Anna's body here. Now, it must be Charles who dug it up.

Such an outrageous and absurd thing; Charles could really do it!

"Who is that girl?" Isabella asked.

Marvin hesitated for a moment and said, "Her name is Siena Scott. For specifics, you'd better ask Mr. Landon yourself."

Isabella conjured the image of Sebastian in her mind. They had been through so much recently. Originally, Isabella thought these hardships had brought her and Sebastian closer together. But now, she felt that Sebastian had hidden too much from her.

The commotion over there was getting louder.

When she turned her head to look again, she saw the mage sprinkling a layer of gold powder on Siena and some on the skeleton.

Siena coughed twice, and her breathing suddenly became rapid. She straightened her chest, her eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling in terror.

Isabella felt breathless, clutching her fingers tightly, and asked, "What is Sebastian's plan?"

Marvin glanced at his watch and looked around. "Wait for Charles to show up."

Isabella understood.

Perhaps Sebastian had already set up a trap outside, just waiting for Charles to appear so they could capture him in one fell swoop.

But Isabella was unsettled. She always felt that Charles wouldn't show up!

As the seconds ticked by, Siena's complexion grew increasingly pale. But Charles did not appear still!

Suddenly, Siena changed direction, facing towards where Isabella and her companions were hiding, seeming to plead for help with intense urgency.

"She's asking for our help!" Isabella said.

No one responded.

Isabella waited for two minutes. Seeing that Siena was about to pass out, she gritted her teeth and rushed out.

"Isabella!" Marvin shouted, trying to grab her, but he couldn't.

By the time they had processed everything, Isabella had already rushed over to support Siena.

"Water!"Â Siena managed to croak out.

At that moment, Marvin, Jack, and Kelsey emerged from the shadows.

Jack moved swiftly, restraining the mage, while Marvin handed over a bottle of water, unscrewing the cap and pouring it over Siena's face.

The layer of gold powder on Siena's face was washed away, and her breathing gradually steadied.

She was safe!

The screech of police sirens pierced the night air, and several patrol cars appeared downstairs, quickly surrounding the area.

Isabella heard someone shout, "Mr. Landon," and looked up to see Sebastian, dressed in black, making his way through the crowd and walking directly toward them.

"Are you alright?"Â Sebastian crouched down in front of her.

Isabella opened her mouth to respond, but before she could say anything, Sebastian's sleeve was suddenly grabbed by a hand dusted with gold powder, accompanied by a weak voice, "Sebastian."

Sebastian glanced at Siena, then gently patted her hand and said, "It's okay now."

Siena bit her lip, her emotions raw from the ordeal. Sebastian's simple reassurance caused her tears to flow uncontrollably.

Soon, medical personnel arrived with a stretcher and carried Siena away.

The fake mage was taken into custody by the police.

Jack and Marvin approached, their faces serious. "Mr. Landon, we couldn't find Charles."

Sebastian pressed his lips together, clearly frustrated. "I see."

His gaze then shifted to the pile of white bones on the chair. His body stiffened slightly before he took a step closer.

"Mr. Landon, we've already examined the bones. They're just plastic models, not real human remains."

Sebastian's eyes flickered with a trace of disdain, but he remained silent as he watched the police gather the evidence.

He stood there for what seemed like ages, and when he turned around, he found Isabella watching him intently.

"Bella,"Â Sebastian said, trying to approach her.

But Isabella instinctively took a step back, as if he were some sort of danger. Her eyes locked onto Sebastian's, her voice strained and raw, "Can you see now?"

"Yeah."Â Sebastian nodded and walked over, taking Isabella's hand. "Let's head home."

Isabella nodded and followed him out.

Jack took Kelsey home, and Marvin took over driving Sebastian's car.

Once they were in the car, Marvin promptly raised the partition between the front and back seats, giving them privacy to talk.

Isabella waited in silence, but Sebastian didn't say a word.

By the time they got home and Marvin had left, Sebastian retrieved some clothes from the wardrobe and handed them to her. "You should clean up. You're covered in gold powder."

Isabella stood still, not reaching for the clothes, and stared at Sebastian. "Sebastian, don't you have anything to explain?"

Sebastian's face showed signs of exhaustion, and his voice matched, "What do you want to know? Just ask."

A wave of sadness washed over Isabella, and she looked away. "Why didn't you tell me about tonight's events?"

"Knowing more means more danger, Bella. I didn't want to put you at risk."

"Why didn't you tell me about Siena? She's Charles's mistress, right? Was that your plan?"

"It was."Â Sebastian rubbed his temples. "I planned to tell you once everything was over."

"Oh really? Were you planning to tell me after it was all over, or did you just never intend to tell me at all?"Â Isabella's tone sharpened.

"Isabella, I don't want to argue about this. It's pointless."

"Pointless? You didn't even tell me about your eyesight returning, leaving me in constant fear. Everyone knew, except me. Is that what you call 'meaningful'?"Â Isabella's eyes reddened, her words growing more cutting.

Sebastian looked at Isabella, his eyes reflecting a cold calm. "And what about you?

"You've been hiding the pregnancy from me from the start, knowing Vanessa was impersonating you and not saying a word. You kept secrets about meeting the Landon family, and about rescuing Matthew. You said it was for Sweetie, and I believed you. But look where we are now. I waited with you at the airport for hours, witnessed firsthand the charade Charles orchestrated. Even now, you still don't trust me. You hopped into Leo's car easily, shared intimate moments with him, and wished him a happy birthday. Did you ever consider my feelings while you were doing all this?"

###chapter 266 Not That Dangerous

Isabella froze.

Isabella stared blankly at Sebastian, struggling to say something. But just as she opened her mouth, Sebastian turned away.

His action seemed like he was avoiding her, or perhaps he had run out of patience and was at a loss for words.

Isabella choked up, her mind went blank, and she couldn't remember what she wanted to say before.

Sebastian put down his clothes, his voice turning cold. "You should wash up and go to bed. I have things to handle, so I won't be with you."

Then, he walked out of the room.

Isabella soaked herself in warm water for a long time.

That night, Sebastian stayed in the study all night.

And Isabella, hugging the quilt, curled up on the bed and stayed awake until dawn.

The next morning, Isabella heard footsteps outside and immediately sat up, running barefoot to open the door.

She hesitated for a second as her fingers touched the doorknob. Just as she was about to open the door, the footsteps outside faded away.

Isabella's heart sank, and her eyes instantly welled up with tears.

"Mr. Landon." Jack stood at the door and was taken aback when he saw Sebastian.

Sebastian's face was full of fatigue, his eyes bloodshot, and dark circles under them. His hair was messy, and he was still wearing the same clothes from last night.

Sebastian had always been meticulous about his appearance. There was only one time when, after Isabella's "death," he'd been in a state of disarray.

Now, the exhaustion radiated from him more than ever before, both inside and out.

"Mr. Landon!"Â Jack almost reached out to help Sebastian.

Sebastian asked, "How did things go?"

"Charles was home last night. Apart from a brief hospital visit, he didn't leave the house. Siena's testimony only confirms that Charles picked her up from the hospital and then took her home. She was drugged upon entering her house and then taken to the construction site. Charles has an alibi and has cleared all suspicion. The so-called 'fake sorcerer' was deemed mentally ill and has been sent to a psychiatric hospital."

As Sebastian listened, his expression darkened.

Jack hesitated before adding, "I asked Kelsey about last night. She followed me out of concern for me, not out of malice towards you. It wasn't Isabella's intention to track you."

"What difference does that make?"Â Sebastian interrupted, his tone icy.

Jack looked taken aback. "You two had a fight?"

A flicker of conflict passed through Sebastian's eyes, but he didn't answer. Instead, he told Jack, "Keep a close watch on Charles. Last night was just a smokescreen. I suspect he's already moved my mother's remains."

Jack nodded. "I've got it covered."

After a moment of hesitation, Jack voiced his concern, "Charles knows you too well. He's got leverage over you."

In plain terms, Charles could always manipulate Sebastian through Anna, while Sebastian was powerless against Charles. If things continued this way, Sebastian's downfall was only a matter of time.

Jack was genuinely worried.

Footsteps approached softly from behind. Sebastian furrowed his brow and said to Jack, "Take good care of Siena."

The remark seemed to carry an unspoken weight.

"Understood."Â Jack nodded and then left.

Sebastian turned around to see Isabella standing there.

Jack tried to soften the mood as he walked over and stood in front of Isabella. Their eyes met, and Isabella's were slightly red-rimmed.

As the sound of a car engine starting outside filled the air, Isabella asked, "Aren't you going to the office today?"

"No. I have other matters to attend to,"Â Sebastian replied, "I'm sorry for what I said to you last night."

Before Sebastian could finish, Isabella shook her head. "You spoke the truth. It's my fault for not being strong enough and for not clarifying things with you sooner."

Sebastian took her hand and pulled her into an embrace. "I haven't been great at this either. I've made mistakes too."

Tears spilled from Isabella's eyes as she clung tightly to Sebastian's waist. "Sebastian, let's not argue anymore, okay?"

"Okay."Â Sebastian bent down and kissed the top of her head.

They held each other in the living room for half an hour, their legs growing numb, unwilling to let go.

It wasn't until the doorbell rang that Sebastian finally released her. He helped Isabella to the sofa before heading to open the door.

Nina and Richard stood outside.

"Sebastian, what are you doing answering the door?"Â Nina, unaware of Sebastian's eye condition, reached out to help him.

Before she could, Richard pulled her back. "You haven't congratulated Mr. Landon on his restored eyesight yet."

Nina blinked, and only then did she notice that Sebastian's eyes were no longer clouded.

"Your eyes are better! When did this happen? Does Bella know? That's wonderful!"Â Nina's excitement was palpable.

Richard gently patted Nina's back. "Let's talk inside."

The wind outside was chilly, and Nina was dressed lightly. Richard was concerned she might catch a cold.

Once inside, Isabella had already risen to greet them. "Nina, Richard."

Nina's sharp eyes immediately noticed Isabella's reddened eyes and cast a questioning look at Sebastian. "What's going on here?"

Sebastian lowered his gaze. "It's my fault."

Isabella quickly intervened. "It's nothing. Please, come in and sit down. I'll make some coffee."

As she headed for the kitchen, Sebastian stopped her. "I'll do it."

Isabella hesitated, but Sebastian had already let go and gone to make the coffee.

"I brought breakfast for you all. Eat while it's still warm."Â Nina opened the food box and handed the dishes to Isabella.

"Thank you, Nina."Â Isabella's eyes welled up again, and she nearly started crying.

As she kept her head down, eating, Nina watched her and said, "I heard about last night. It was so dangerous-why didn't you think to call me?"

Isabella shook her head and reassured her, "It wasn't that dangerous."

Nina understood that Isabella was trying to comfort her, so she didn't push further. Instead, she said with concern, "Next time, make sure to call me. I might not be able to do much, but I can talk to Zaire and Richard. They'll help."

Isabella nodded, though she didn't want to burden Nina. Nina had endured so much hardship in her childhood and had devoted herself to helping Isabella over the years. Later, because of Charlie, Nina's marriage faltered, so Isabella had hoped for some peace. She didn't want to add to Nina's worries.

Isabella also wished she could shield Nina from all this, but her own situation wasn't any better. Sweetie was still missing, Charles was lurking, and everything seemed to be falling apart. She felt helpless, unable to do anything.

Thinking about this made Isabella's chest tighten, and she couldn't eat another bite.

At that moment, Richard spoke up, "I've found a lead on Sweetie."

###chapter 267 Siena

Nowadays, Samantha had been convicted of child trafficking and would soon be sentenced. Charles did everything without giving anything away, and all the evidence pointed to Samantha's crime, leaving her with no escape.

As for Sweetie's whereabouts, Samantha only revealed that the child was taken away by someone, but she didn't know the specific identity of that person.

Richard's people started from this point and found out that on that night, there was a small boat carrying a swaddled baby heading to Seaside City.

However, for some unknown reason, the boat stopped for two hours midway and then returned the same way.

"Now, as long as we find the boat's registration number and the people from that night, we will have a breakthrough." Richard said.

This brief description took only a minute or two, but Isabella broke out in a cold sweat.

"It was Charles. He was afraid Leo and Samantha would betray him, so he had someone take Sweetie away!" Isabella's voice trembled, her thoughts racing. 'Why send Sweetie to Seaside City?'

At this moment, Sebastian walked over with a cup of coffee and chimed in, "Charles has property over there. If I'm not mistaken, he originally planned to hide the child there."

Isabella looked at him in surprise.

Sebastian said, "As soon as Sweetie went missing, I had people check, but she wasn't there."

In fact, up to now, Sebastian's people hadn't withdrawn from Seaside City; they've been keeping an eye on it. As soon as Sweetie appeared, Sebastian's people could immediately bring her back and bring Charles to justice.

Disappointingly, despite the passage of so much time and Samantha's capture, there had been no news whatsoever from Seaside City.

Seeing Isabella in such pain, Nina felt terrible too. Nina held Isabella's hand and comforted her, "Bella, don't worry. Sweetie will come back."

"Nina." Isabella was in so much pain that she could hardly breathe, and at the mention of Sweetie, she couldn't stop her tears.

Nina hugged her, and tears rolled down her own cheeks as well.

Sitting across from them, Richard felt bad seeing Nina cry and said, "In truth, the quickest way to find Sweetie lies through Charles."

Richard turned and directly asked Sebastian, "Mr. Landon, what's your next plan?"

Richard's question drew the attention of Isabella and Nina as well.

The three of them looked at Sebastian in unison.

Sebastian glanced at Isabella before saying, "Three days from now is Charles' birthday. I plan to act then."

Richard didn't ask for details, as if he had already guessed Sebastian would do this. He just nodded and said, "I figured you'd act at that time. Let me know if you need anything."

After Nina and Richard left, Sebastian and Isabella went back to the upstairs bedroom.

Isabella was unsettled and she finally found the chance to ask, "Is it really Charles' birthday in three days? What are you planning to do?"

Sebastian guided her into the walk-in closet and draped a woolen coat over her shoulders. "Charles is someone who's extremely self-centered. Every year he throws a big birthday bash. This year, I'm giving him a very special gift."

"What kind of gift?"Â Isabella asked, gripping his hand, her anxiety palpable.

Sebastian raised both hands to gently hold her shoulders. "You'll find out soon enough."

It was then that Isabella noticed the coat she was wearing. "We're going out. Where are we headed?"

"To the hospital."

Jack was off on an errand, so Sebastian was driving. Isabella calculated that the drive from their home to the hospital would be under half an hour.

However, as they drove out of the city, it was clear they weren't heading to the city hospital.

Eventually, the car arrived at a private care center located in the southern part of town.

It wasn't exactly a hospital, but a large private care facility. The building was elegant, surrounded by picturesque landscapes with lush greenery and serene waters.

Upon their arrival, a staff member led them through the facility. Isabella was filled with curiosity, but she held her questions, eager to discover the surprise.

When the elevator reached the top floor, they were guided to the innermost room, where the staff member finally stopped. "This is the place."

Sebastian nodded, and the staff member left them.

Sebastian knocked on the door, and after a few seconds, it was opened by a girl with a pure yet alluring appearance.

"Siena?"Â Isabella recognized her from their previous encounter and addressed her by name without hesitation.

"Hi, Isabella,"Â Siena greeted warmly, taking Isabella's hand. Her eyes were full of friendliness, but she seemed worried that Isabella might not be pleased. "Is it alright if I call you that?"

Isabella stiffened momentarily but nodded. "Yes, that's fine."

Siena pulled her inside. "Make yourselves comfortable. I'll get some water for you."

Isabella noticed Siena was still in the care center's hospital gown and thought of the events from last night. "You should rest. I'll handle it."

"Please don't bother,"Â Siena said with a blush, reaching for the kettle.

Isabella took two paper cups, intending to help. Just as she reached for the kettle, Siena suddenly had a slight tremor, spilling hot water over Isabella's hand.

Isabella jumped in surprise.

Siena's reaction was even more pronounced. She immediately dropped the kettle and grabbed Isabella's hand to check for burns. "I'm so sorry! Did it hurt?"

Seeing Siena's eyes welling up, Isabella felt a pang of sympathy. "It's fine. It's just warm water."

"What happened?"Â Sebastian came over.

Seeing the wet spot on Isabella's hand, Sebastian frowned.

Siena stepped back, biting her lip, looking thoroughly remorseful.

"It's really nothing," Isabella tried to comfort her, but Sebastian quickly pulled her to sit down and then made a phone call. Soon, someone arrived with burn ointment.

As Sebastian applied the ointment to Isabella's hand, Siena stood nearby, tears welling in her eyes. She repeatedly tried to speak but swallowed her words each time.

Isabella, unable to see someone suffering like this, reached out and gently pulled Siena closer. "Seriously, it's okay. Don't be too hard on yourself."

Siena looked at Isabella, her eyes conflicted, then shifted her gaze to Sebastian, awaiting his reaction.

Sebastian, focusing on Isabella's hand, took no notice of Siena. Once he had finished applying the ointment, he held Isabella's hand to his lips, blowing on it softly, with great care.

This made Siena even more anxious, her head bowed as if she were a child caught in a mistake.

Isabella tugged at Sebastian's hand to get his attention.

Sebastian finally noticed Siena, offering a nonchalant remark, "It's fine now. Just sit down."

Siena looked at Sebastian, understanding his implication. If Isabella had been seriously hurt, things would be very different.

###chapter 268 The Grand Gift

In Isabella's view, Siena seemed very afraid of Sebastian and also very concerned about him.

Ever since Siena appeared, Isabella had been curious about Siena's true identity.

She thought, 'Siena's last name was Scott, the same as Anna's, and she could easily get close to Charles. Could there be some connection?

'Today, with Sebastian bringing me here, all these mysteries should be unraveled.'

"Let me introduce, Siena Scott," Sebastian said, holding Isabella's fingers. "She is the girl my mom adopted."

Isabella was surprised. "Adopted?"

She thought, 'So, Siena is Sebastian's nominal sister?'

Sebastian seemed to read Isabella's mind and explained in more detail, "My mom always wanted a daughter, but unfortunately, I was a son. One day, she came across Siena, who had been abandoned by her parents on the street. My mom wanted to take her home, but Charles strongly opposed it. So, my mom sent her to an orphanage and secretly adopted her behind Charles's back. After my mom died, I've been supporting her all these years."

Isabella was shocked. "So she approached Charles..."

"It was my choice!" Siena interrupted, glancing at Sebastian. "If it weren't for Anna and Sebastian, I would have died long ago. They gave me a new life. Since Charles killed Anna and tormented Sebastian, I'm willing to do these things for them!"

Siena's tone was unwavering, as if she was speaking with the conviction of a deeply held belief.

Isabella found it absurd. Siena was actually two years younger than her, and to seek revenge, Siena sacrificed herself to Charles. It was truly a form of self-destruction!

But seeing Siena's determination, it was clear she was going to go through with it, and Sebastian didn't seem to have any intention of stopping her. Given the situation, Isabella couldn't say much more.

After a while, medical staff knocked and entered, carrying various instruments.

Siena cooperated by lying flat on the bed like a puppet, allowing them to manipulate her. But her eyes were always fixed in Sebastian's direction.

The examination lasted about ten minutes. After it ended, Siena sat up and gently stroked her lower abdomen.

The movement was subtle, and if Isabella hadn't been pregnant before, she might not have noticed it.

While Isabella was still in doubt, the medical staff handed Siena two pills. "Ms. Scott, these are today's prenatal vitamins."

"Okay." Siena took the cup of water and calmly swallowed the pills.

At that moment, Isabell was stunned. She stared blankly as the medical staff left one by one. Siena, still sitting on the bed, looked at Sebastian and said, "Sebastian, don't worry. I have been doing my check-ups and taking my medicine every day."

Isabella turned sharply to look at Sebastian, her eyes filled with disbelief.

Sebastian glanced back at Isabella, then held her hand and stood up, saying to Siena, "Get some rest."

"Okay." Siena nodded obediently, her eyes glued to him.

As Sebastian and Isabella reached the door, Siena's voice came from behind. "Sebastian, when will you come to see me again?"

Sebastian paused for a moment and replied, "After everything is over."

A trace of sadness flashed in Siena's eyes, but she maintained her smile and nodded. "Okay."

Siena then watched as he and Isabella left.

Isabella was led by Sebastian into the elevator.

As soon as the elevator doors closed, Sebastian pulled her into his arms and gently embraced her.

Isabella leaned on Sebastian's shoulder, feeling a bit stiff. Smelling his fresh scent, she suddenly felt an unprecedented sense of unfamiliarity.

Isabella spoke in a muffled voice, "Siena is pregnant?"

She knew Siena was actually pregnant, but she still wanted to hear it from Sebastian.

"Yes." Sebastian nodded, his arms tightening around her slightly.

Isabella's eyes were wide open. "She's carrying Charles' child. Is this the big gift you mentioned for Charles?"

"Yes." Sebastian said.

Isabella shook her head and stepped back from his embrace, looking up at Sebastian. "And then? After Charles knows about the child, what do you plan to do?"

She had a feeling that Sebastian wouldn't let the child be born.

Even if the child were born, both the child and Siena would only become tools to control Charles.

Thinking of this, Isabella felt a chill in her heart. She wasn't willing to believe that Sebastian could do such a thing.

She was eager for reassurance, her eyes brimming with desperation. She yearned for Sebastian to shake his head, to tell her that the child was an accident and that he would make other arrangements.

But after a brief silence, Sebastian cupped Isabella's face in his hands, gazing into her eyes. "I know this feels low, but it's our last option. Charles cares more about having an heir than anything else. He might not bother with Siena, but he will certainly care about the child. As long as we have leverage, Charles will be forced into a corner."

Isabella couldn't bear it any longer. She pushed Sebastian away and shook her head. "If Charles is the grave, then what you're doing is just pushing Siena and the child right into it."

Sebastian and his mother, Anna, were already suffering greatly from this, and for someone as young as Siena, it was nothing short of a disaster.

Even if Siena had willingly accepted this, and even if Sebastian had a hundred percent chance of success, Isabella still saw it as madness, a deeply inhumane act!

Sebastian furrowed his brow. "Bella, I know your kindness makes it hard for you to accept this, but things have come to this point. Siena is the final piece I have to play. If this fails, you know as well as I do that with Charles'Â current mindset, I'll be left with nothing."

Isabella was at a loss for words.

Indeed, Charles had always played them all like pawns. If they didn't make him relent now, the consequences were unimaginable.

Sebastian reached out and drew Isabella into his embrace again, speaking softly to calm her. "Bella, don't worry. Once Charles is dealt with, I'll take care of Siena and everything else. I'll also find Sweetie. Then, we can be a family again."

Isabella's heart remained uneasy, but she had no better solution.

After leaving the care center, Sebastian drove them back, but halfway through, his eye pain flared up, and Isabella had to take over the wheel.

Instead of heading home, Isabella drove straight to the Landon Group.

She had already contacted Jack, and Marvin was waiting in the office.

Helping Sebastian into the rest room, Marvin pulled out needles for acupuncture.

Seeing the long needles made Isabella's heart race. Instinctively, she stepped forward and grabbed Marvin's wrist, trying to prevent him from starting.

Marvin looked surprised and turned to her. "These needles have been used many times before. They're just to open up his blood vessels and nerves; it shouldn't be too painful."

Isabella bit her lip, watching Sebastian's pained expression, unable to bear it.

Marvin added, "If you can't handle watching, you might as well wait outside. It'll only take a few minutes."

Isabella reluctantly let go of his wrist and stepped out, her mind still troubled.

###chapter 269 Shares

Marvin claimed that a few dozen minutes would pass quickly, but Isabella, waiting outside for merely three minutes, already felt each second dragging on for an eternity.

Laura pushed the door open and came in with some snacks pastries, but she had no appetite.

"Mr. Landon isn't ready yet?" Laura asked with concern.

Isabella shook her head, her face full of worry.

Laura offered a few comforting words, then moved aside to chat with Jack about work.

Just then, Isabella's phone rang.

It was Zaire calling.

Isabella answered, "Hello."

"Isabella, do you have time right now? I just got word that a shareholder of the Landon Group wants to sell their shares. I'm heading over there now," Zaire said.Â 

Last time, Isabella learned from Zaire that Charles was secretly buying up shares of the Landon Group. She had told Zaire to inform her if it happened again.

She didn't expect it to happen so soon.

"I have time." Isabella asked for the address, hung up the phone, and then asked Jack for the car keys.

Jack's phone buzzed twice, and he glanced at it before asking, "Where are you headed? I was just about to step out. If it's on my way, I can give you a lift."

Isabella pressed her lips and replied, "Blue Horizon Cafe."

Jack raised an eyebrow in surprise. "You're going to Blue Horizon Cafe too?"

"Yep."Â Isabella had already pieced most of it together, so she decided to just ask directly. "Is it about selling shares?"

Jack looked taken aback. "How did you know?"

Realizing that Isabella had received a call earlier, Jack seemed to put two and two together. "Was it Mr. Jose who called you?"

"Yeah."Â Isabella grabbed her coat and put it on. "We shouldn't waste any time. Let's go."

Jack hesitated, unsure whether to inform Sebastian about this.

Understanding his hesitation, Isabella said, "It's best not to mention this to him right now. I don't want him distracted. Jack, if you trust me, then let's go together. If not, I can just take a cab."

Jack was speechless.

He thought, 'Indeed, Sebastian ha`s recently been pushing Isabella to learn more about the company's affairs, and with Zaire overseeing things, there shouldn't be any major issues.'

At the Blue Horizon Cafe, by the time Isabella and Jack arrived, Zaire had already intercepted the shareholders.

As they entered the private room, they saw the two shareholders involved in the sale of shares. Upon seeing Jack and Isabella, they looked like mice caught in the open, nervously averting their gazes.

Jack stepped forward. "Mr. Lawson, Mr. Vaughn, I never imagined that despite your apparent wealth and comfort, you'd be so strapped for cash that you're forced to sell off company shares."

Being just Sebastian's assistant, Jack's words didn't carry much weight. Liam Lawson glanced at him and said, "Mr. Brown, do you really think it's so easy to judge? We're not broke, but with Sebastian running things this way, the Landon Group is on a fast track to collapse."

Vincent Vaughn chimed in, "We don't want to be dragged down by Sebastian's fight with Charles. If he wants to battle it out with Charles, he shouldn't pull us into it."

"Exactly. We're shareholders, not some lowly assistant. What gives you the right to lecture us?"

Isabella, unable to hold back any longer, spoke up, "Both of you are long-standing members of this company. You must have witnessed how Mr. Landon built the Landon Group from scratch. His capabilities are undeniable. The battle hasn't even really begun yet, so why are the shareholders pulling out already?"

The two men exchanged a look but remained silent.

Zaire gave Isabella a nod of encouragement, urging her to continue.

Bolstered by the support, Isabella pressed on. "I understand that many shareholders have been tempted to sell their shares under pressure. But have you considered that Charles is a crafty fox? If the Landon Group were truly on the brink of collapse as he claims, would he really be buying back shares at such high prices? You two are seasoned business veterans-does Charles strike you as the kind of guy who would make a losing investment?

"To put it bluntly, this is just a business battle. Charles is not only trying to undermine Mr. Landon but is also working behind the scenes to tarnish the Landon Group's reputation, all to acquire your shares. When the Landon Group changes hands and Mr. Landon is ousted, Charles will walk away with a fortune. Tell me, what do you have left in this game?

"Even if Charles has promised you something, do you honestly believe he'll keep his word? From what I know, Charles is extremely self-serving and detests betrayal. Selling shares behind Mr. Landon's back is an act of betrayal. If Charles has any conscience left, maybe he'll throw you a bone. But as anyone in business knows, conscience is a slippery thing."

Liam and Vincent exchanged glances, their expressions softening as they considered her arguments. They were well aware of Charles'Â reputation.

Their main concern had been avoiding Charles'Â wrath and not getting blacklisted from the industry. However, if Sebastian managed to turn things around, they'd be left in a difficult spot regardless.

After a moment of silent communication, Vincent spoke up, "If Mr. Landon is behind this, we can hold off on selling the shares. But tell us, does Mr. Landon really have a chance of making a comeback?"

"He does!"Â Isabella replied firmly. "He absolutely does!"

Liam chuckled. "Words alone won't sway us. If you want us to stand with Mr. Landon, you need to show some genuine commitment, right?"

Isabella considered this and said, "What do you want? Just let us know. We can agree to most things as long as they're reasonable."

Liam assessed her with a scrutinizing gaze. "But I'm curious-does Ms. Miller have the authority to make such promises?"

At this moment, Zaire spoke up calmly, "How about my endorsement?"

Given Zaire's connection with Sebastian and the considerable influence of the Jose Group, Liam and Vincent had no grounds to argue. With Zaire's assurance, they had no choice but to accept.

"Alright. With Mr. Jose and Ms. Miller backing this, we're committed to not selling out Mr. Landon."

Isabella let out a sigh of relief.

As Liam and Vincent prepared to leave, Isabella had a sudden thought and asked, "One more thing-do you know if any other shareholders are planning to sell? If so, could you try to persuade them or at least give us a heads-up?"

Vincent hesitated.

Liam finally said, "Since we've decided to stick with the Landon Group, we're in this together. If we can prevent further shares from being sold, it's an added advantage. We'll do our best to persuade any dissenters and let you know if we can't change their minds."

Hearing this, Vincent added, "I've heard that Mr. Nelson might be considering selling his shares as well."

Jack's expression changed abruptly. "Mr. Nelson?"

###chapter 270 Nathaniel Nelson

Nathaniel Nelson, full name Nathaniel Nelson, was one of the earliest investors in the Landon Group, having invested alongside Sebastian. Aside from Sebastian, Nathaniel held the largest share in the company.

"If Mr. Nelson really decides to sell his shares, once the deal is done, the Landon Group will truly fall into Charles' hands."Â Jack's face was grim.

Vincent nodded in agreement. "Yes, that's why I decided to sell first. Not only to do Charles a favor, but also because I'm afraid that if Charles takes over the Landon Group, he might push out all the small shareholders like us. If that happens, the situation could spiral out of control."

Liam, clearly unaware of the situation, was shocked and took a while to process the information. He jabbed Vincent in the ribs and said, "Why didn't you tell me about something this big earlier?"

"I wanted to, but I was worried you'd stir up trouble and make it common knowledge."

"When have I ever stirred up trouble?"

"When haven't you?"

"You're impossible."

As Liam and Vincent were about to start bickering, Isabella stepped in, "Why is Mr. Nelson looking to sell his shares?"

Isabella had just learned from Jack that Nathaniel was one of the early backers of Sebastian. Back then, Sebastian had nothing to his name. Nathaniel was a significant figure in Sebastian's rise; without his investment, the Landon Group might not even exist today.

Given Nathaniel's foresight, it seemed contradictory that he would choose to sell his shares at this crucial moment.

Vincent replied, "I'm not entirely sure of the details, but it seems Mrs. Nelson is behind this decision."

Liam's face darkened. "I hate to say it, but if you can't stop Mr. Nelson, the Landon Group is as good as done for."

Jack escorted Liam and Vincent out, and Zaire said, "Why don't you sit down and have some water?"

He poured Isabella a cup of coffee while she sat down, holding the intricately textured cup, feeling at a loss. "Mr. Jose, do you know Nathaniel well?"

"I've had a few dealings with him, but I wouldn't say I know him deeply. Overall, Nathaniel gives off one clear impression."

"What's that?"

Zaire sipped his tea slowly, "He listens to his wife."

"And?"

Isabella found the notion of a henpecked husband too abstract. She needed more insight to strategize her approach with Nathaniel.

Having finished his coffee, Zaire glanced at his phone and stood up to leave. "You might want to talk to Sebastian. He knows Nathaniel better than I do. I've got to go now."

Zaire left in a hurry, and Isabella, hoping to catch Miley, found that Zaire was already out of sight.

"Always in such a rush,"Â Isabella murmured to herself. As she turned around, she bumped into Quentin Black, who was exiting the adjacent room.

Quentin, a clean-cut man with a gentle demeanor like Sebastian, also gave off an impression of someone not to be underestimated. His mild appearance seemed to conceal another, more formidable side.

As Isabella was about to look away, Quentin gave her a friendly smile.

Not recognizing Quentin, Isabella returned the smile out of courtesy but said nothing more before turning and leaving.

As she walked away, another man emerged from the room-Michael.

"Mr. Black,"Â Michael addressed Quentin with the same respect he showed Richard, though his attitude towards Quentin carried a tinge of resignation, unlike the genuine admiration he had for Richard.

As Michael emerged, Isabella had already left, so they missed each other. Noticing Quentin's gaze fixed in one direction, Michael glanced that way as well but saw nothing of interest.

When Michael turned his gaze back, he met Quentin's cold, penetrating stare.

Michael immediately lowered his eyes. "Mr. Black."

Quentin withdrew his gaze and asked, "When will Richard be here?"

"Richard called a moment ago,"Â Michael said, "He's caught up with something unexpected and won't make it today. He mentioned that since you're back and won't be leaving soon, he will host you at another time to make amends in person."

Quentin smirked slightly, "Is that Richard's exact wording?"

Michael fell silent.

It wasn't Richard's exact words; the latter part was Michael's addition, meant to smooth things over. Clearly, it hadn't been very convincing.

Quentin said with a sneer, "No worries. You're right; I won't be going anywhere soon. There will be plenty of chances for him to host a meal and apologize in person."

Michael was at a loss for words.

He later relayed this to Richard.

Richard frowned. "Is that really what he said?"

"Yes,"Â Michael nodded, his own worry evident, "Richard, Quentin's return feels different this time."

"In what way?"Â Richard asked.

"Before, he'd come back, do the usual checks and collections, and then leave. This time, though, he seems in no rush to go, hasn't been pushing for collections, and hasn't even visited the casino much,"Â Michael said, his brow furrowed. "It's hard to put a finger on it, but something just feels off."

Richard was silent for a moment before instructing, "Have someone keep an eye on him."

"Alright,"Â Michael agreed, then hesitated before adding, "But Richard, it might be best if you avoid the Jose family for now. I'm worried Ms. Johnson might find out about Nina."

"Keep your mouth shut,"Â Richard said just as the driver pulled up to their destination.

Michael glanced out the window.

As soon as Richard advised against visiting the Jose family residence, the car stopped right in front of the Jose family's place.

Richard got out but didn't rush inside. He tapped on the car window and told Michael, "Sebastian's planning to make his move in three days. Have some people ready to assist."

Michael clicked his tongue, "Richard, we don't have any dealings with Sebastian. We already helped him with Isabella last time. Do we really need to get involved again?"

Richard gave him a sidelong glance. "What do you know?"

Michael smirked, "Oh, I understand perfectly. Your support for Sebastian is obviously because of Nina. She and Isabella are sisters, and that means you and Sebastian will be linked in the future."

Richard's eyes narrowed slightly, "You seem to know quite a bit."

Michael just chuckled, resting his arm on the window.

At that moment, Nina and Kelsey appeared, walking arm in arm. From a distance, Kelsey called out sweetly, "Richard's here!"

Richard turned around. The cold expression he had moments ago was replaced by a warm smile. He took Nina's hand and gave it a gentle squeeze, saying softly, "I'm here to pick up Nina. We have plans to go shopping today."

"Got it,"Â Kelsey said, stepping back politely. "I won't keep you. Have a great time."

A few minutes later, Michael was dropped off, and the car drove away.

###chapter 271 No Way

Michael thought Richard was the most unreliable friend he had ever met.

Kelsey was driving out and hadn't planned to pay attention to Michael, but as her car passed by him, Michael suddenly darted in front of it.

Luckily, Kelsey hit the brakes in time; otherwise, Michael would have been knocked.

Kelsey gripped the steering wheel, still shaken, as the passenger door swung open and Michael slid into the seat.

"To the entertainment center, please," Michael said, his eyes glued to his phone.

Kelsey stared at him in disbelief. "Do you think I'm your driver?"

Michael glanced up from his phone and looked at her. "What else?"

Kelsey bit her lip, annoyed. "Get out!"

Michael looked at Kelsey, but instead of getting out, he buckled his seatbelt. Then he adjusted the seat and continued playing on his phone.

"Michael, get out!" Kelsey reached to unbuckle his seatbelt, but Michael grabbed her hand.

Michael rubbed his forehead with a hint of frustration. "It's hard to catch a cab around here. Could you give me a ride and drop me off somewhere where I can find one?"

He hesitated, then added, "I'll pay you for the trouble."

Given the situation, Kelsey couldn't really refuse. Michael was Richard's associate, after all. After a moment's pause, she relented. "Alright."

"Thanks,"Â Michael said with a hint of a smile, releasing Kelsey's hand and settling back into the seat.

As they drove for a while, they approached a cab stand. Kelsey planned to drop Michael off there, but when she glanced over, she was surprised to see him reclined in the seat with his eyes closed, breathing steadily. He looked like he was asleep!

Kelsey was taken aback, thinking, 'Why is Michael sleeping in my car?'

Irritated, she pulled over and reached out to shake him. "Hey, Michael."

The moment her hand touched his jacket, her wrist was suddenly squeezed painfully.

Kelsey looked up to find Michael's eyes blazing with a chilling intensity. Her heart skipped a beat, and she momentarily lost her train of thought.

Michael's eyes, though still carrying traces of sleepiness, were now filled with a dangerous edge. It was clear he had been jolted awake from a deep sleep, and the hostility emanating from him was palpable.

Kelsey saw her own reflection in his eyes, clear and unsettling. The pain in her wrist made her wince as if it might be crushed.

Michael quickly realized what had happened, releasing her wrist and softening his gaze. "Sorry about that."

Kelsey rubbed her wrist, "We're at a spot where you can catch a cab now. Get out."

Michael peered out the window and said with a grin, "Oh, I forgot to mention-I don't have my wallet."

"You've got a phone, don't you?"

"It's dead,"Â Michael said with a look of innocent bewilderment.

Kelsey didn't buy it; she had seen him using his phone earlier. She suspected he was toying with her, trying to avoid getting out of the car.

Before she could protest, Michael lifted his phone to show her the black screen.

Kelsey grabbed the phone and tried to turn it on, but it was clear it was indeed out of battery.

At this point, leaving Michael behind would be pointless.

Kelsey handed the phone back to him. "Where's this entertainment center you mentioned? I'll take you there."

It seemed the only option was to drive him after all.

Michael gave her a rough direction, and Kelsey responded, "Perfect. That's actually on my way."

As it turned out, Michael's destination was in the same direction as Jack's apartment. Kelsey had planned to pick up a small cake to celebrate their time together today, and it just so happened that she was headed in that direction.

Kelsey didn't say anything further. She started the car and drove to pick up the cake.

Arriving near the bakery, she parked the car, unbuckled her seatbelt, and stepped out. "I'll be right back with the cake."

She walked into the charming, whimsical bakery. After providing her reservation number, a staff member went to retrieve her cake.

While she waited, the door to the bakery swung open, and Michael strolled in.

"Sir, would you like to sample our new product? It's a free tasting,"Â a friendly young woman in a sweet, frilly dress offered enthusiastically.

"Sure,"Â Michael replied, "though I don't usually have a sweet tooth. I've got bad teeth."

"Don't worry,"Â the young woman said with a bubbly smile. "Our cakes use only the finest ingredients, and you can choose the sugar content. You might like this low-sugar, low-fat cream. It's delicious without being too heavy."Â She spoke with a singsong tone, her smile almost melting as she looked at Michael.

Michael's gaze lingered on her for a moment, then he grinned. "You're working hard to convince me, so I'll give it a try."

The staff member handed him a small sample of the dessert.

Instead of using his hand, Michael leaned in and took the bite directly from her hand.

From Kelsey's perspective, it looked like Michael had nearly licked the girl's fingers.

She turned away in disgust, unable to watch the awkward scene any longer.

"Ms. Jose, here's your cake,"Â the staff member said, presenting it to Kelsey for confirmation.

The cake was small but exquisitely crafted. It had "Happy Anniversary"Â written on it, with the exact date noted in the corner.

It was a little touch of romance for her, something Kelsey, who valued ceremony, appreciated. She and Jack had recently confirmed their relationship, so these small celebrations were a must.

Kelsey wore a sweet smile. "Looks perfect. Please wrap it up for me."

"Certainly, Ms. Jose. Please bear with us for a moment."

"No rush. I'm not in a hurry."

As Kelsey turned around with the cake, she saw Michael still chatting with the sample girl.

Michael maintained a calm, indifferent demeanor, but the young woman was clearly smitten, her eyes practically sparkling with hearts.

As Kelsey approached, she overheard the girl shyly asking, "I'm working right now, so I can't chat much. Can we exchange WhatsApp contacts?"

The girl had already pulled out her phone, her face flushed with anticipation.

Michael wore a sardonic smile as he coolly replied, "No way."

The girl looked stunned, clearly caught off guard by the rejection.

After all, they had been chatting so warmly. If Michael wasn't interested, why had he engaged with her for so long?

Kelsey watched the scene with growing irritation, feeling a strong urge to punch Michael.

At that moment, Michael's eyes flicked toward her, and Kelsey saw a flash of mischief and amusement. Her internal alarm bells rang loudly.

Sure enough, the next thing she heard was Michael saying, "You'll have to ask my girlfriend about that."

"Girlfriend?"Â The girl's face went beet red.

Realizing something, she followed Michael's gaze and saw Kelsey standing there, holding the cake.

###chapter 272 Self-respect

Kelsey had never felt so speechless in her life.

The sample girl looked at Kelsey with tearful eyes, as if she were about to break into pieces.

"Hey, babe, did you get the cake?"Â Michael sauntered over, reaching out to put his arm around Kelsey's shoulders with a smug grin.

Kelsey swatted his hand away and shot him an irritated look. "Who's your 'babe'?"

She thought, 'Michael's mouth seems to have a mind of its own-who exactly does he think is his girlfriend?'

Kelsey glared at him, but Michael just chuckled and shrugged with an exaggerated look of innocence. "I wasn't flirting. It's just her being overly emotional."

His words cut deep, and nearby customers turned to cast sharp, judgmental glances at the sample girl.

"Um,"Â Kelsey stepped forward, about to explain, but the girl, clearly overwhelmed, ran off in tears.

Kelsey was at a loss for words.

Unfazed, Michael picked out two items from the display case and handed them to Kelsey. "Can you pay for these?"

Before Kelsey could respond, Michael had already dragged her to the cashier, handing the items over for scanning.

Without cash or a phone to pay with, Michael left Kelsey to foot the bill, leaving her simmering with frustration.

Once they were back in the car, Kelsey couldn't hold it in any longer. "Michael, get out!

"You're filthy. Don't sit in my car!"

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Is this about what just happened? I told you, she was the one imagining things. I didn't do anything."

"Michael, are you really this clueless, or are you just pretending? Have you ever heard of 'self-respect'?"

"Self-respect,"Â Michael repeated, chewing over the phrase with a serious expression. "First time hearing it."

Kelsey flung open the car door. "Get out!"

Michael frowned, clearly irritated. He actually got out of the car and stood by the roadside.

Kelsey slammed the car door shut and drove off.

Michael watched her drive away with a smirk. "What a cold-hearted woman."

For the next three days, Isabella was busy handling Sebastian's work.

What started as small tasks quickly escalated to matters requiring Sebastian's signature and official stamp, which Isabella managed with growing ease.

She also learned about Nathaniel from Sebastian. It turned out Nathaniel and Sebastian were alumni, and Nathaniel came from a humble background, hailing from a poor, remote area.

In the beginning, Nathaniel was just another ordinary guy, going through the motions of a routine job.

His life took a turn when he met Ophelia Murphy.

Ophelia's family was involved in import-export trade, and as their only child, she was pampered.

Perhaps it was fate, or maybe just a stroke of luck, but Ophelia fell for Nathaniel and, without a second thought, married him.

At that time, Nathaniel's investment in the Landon Group was driven by his urgent need to prove himself to Ophelia's family.

It was both an investment and a gamble.

Clearly, Nathaniel won the bet. The Landon Group soared to prominence within a few short years, and Nathaniel's profits were through the roof. With money came power, and with power, he earned respect in Ophelia's family.

However, success often led to arrogance. Nathaniel, at his peak, let his ego get the best of him and took a mistress.

When Ophelia found out, she cut him off completely, and Nathaniel never strayed again.

This episode earned him the reputation of a "henpecked husband."

Sebastian remarked, "Nathaniel's actually quite superficial. I suspect Charles offered him something lucrative to persuade him to sell his shares. What that might be, I can't say."

Isabella thought that in the business world, deals are typically about money and status. Charles could offer what they could match.

Sebastian shook his head. "Nathaniel's a tough nut to crack. Bella, don't go behind my back and deal with him."

Still concerned, Isabella asked, "But if we don't approach him, what if he sells his shares?"

"I've already spoken to him. We discussed the terms and what's on the table, but he seems set on selling. I'm starting to suspect Charles might be holding something over him."

Otherwise, Nathaniel's stubborn nature would make him reluctant to let Charles dictate terms.

Isabella felt the situation was shrouded in mystery.

Although Sebastian's eyes had improved, he still couldn't overwork them and needed Marvin to come by for acupuncture regularly.

As a result, more and more of the company's responsibilities were shifting to Isabella.

Three days later was Charles'Â birthday party, and the media was already buzzing about it. Reports suggested Charles was hosting a grand celebration at his home, complete with a fireworks display planned for the evening.

The scale of these preparations made Isabella uneasy, as she suspected Charles was planning something significant.

As the day approached, her anxiety grew.

After much consideration, Isabella decided she needed to meet with Nathaniel. However, she had promised Sebastian that she wouldn't act on anything without consulting him first.

So, she called Sebastian, but Jack answered the phone.

"Mr. Landon is currently getting acupuncture. Is there something I can help you with?" Jack's voice was curt.

Isabella replied, "I need to speak with Nathaniel."

Jack was momentarily silent.

"Jack, just put me through to Sebastian. I need to talk to him directly."

After a brief pause, Jack's voice came through again, "He'll be done in a few minutes. I'll let Mr. Landon know what you need."

Isabella agreed and ended the call.

A couple of minutes later, her phone buzzed with a text message, not a call, but rather a location pin. Along with it was a brief note from Seb: [Be careful.]

Just as Isabella was wondering why Sebastian hadn't called her back, Jack's number appeared on her phone.

"Isabella, Mr. Landon has an important meeting this afternoon. I've already informed him about your need to see Nathaniel. Do you need Nathaniel's address?"

"No thanks. Sebastian already sent it to me."

"Alright,"Â Jack's tone was nonchalant. "Well, good luck. If you can get Nathaniel on board, it'll make things easier for Mr. Landon. Thanks for stepping up."

"It's my responsibility,"Â Isabella responded.

Jack added, "Is Laura with you? Let her go with you. If you run into any issues, call me right away."

"Will do."

After hanging up, Jack stood quietly by the glass window for a moment.

The door to the waiting room opened, and Sebastian and Marvin walked out.

"Who was that on the phone?"Â Sebastian asked, looking weary.

Jack hesitated for a second before answering, "It was a call from a client, urging us to hurry."

"Got it."

###chapter 273 A Rocky Start

As Isabella was heading out, Laura quickly followed suit.

Once they were in the car, Laura buckled her seatbelt and asked, "Where are we heading?"

"To meet with a shareholder from the Landon Group," Isabella replied.

Laura had heard about the small shareholders privately selling their shares in the Landon Group. Having been with Isabella for the past few days and even persuading a couple of shareholders herself, she was relatively unfazed by the situation.

The car started moving, but Isabella felt a lingering uncertainty. Her knowledge of Nathaniel was limited, and she questioned if she could truly persuade him with so little information.

"Laura, do you know Nathaniel?" Isabella asked, hoping Laura's perspective as a long-time employee and a senior assistant to Sebastian might offer some new insights.

Laura's expression stiffened. "Nathaniel?"

Isabella, focused on driving, didn't notice Laura's discomfort. "Yeah, he's one of the shareholders in the Landon Group. They all refer to him as Mr. Nelson."

Laura lowered her gaze, her fingers twisting nervously around her seatbelt. "I've heard of him but don't really know much."

"Oh, I see." Isabella nodded in understanding.

Laura was just an assistant, after all, and even if she knew Nathaniel, she probably didn't have much direct contact with him.

The drive continued in silence.

As they neared Nathaniel's house, Laura suddenly clutched her stomach and said, "Isabella, could you pull over for a moment?"

Isabella stopped the car by the side of the road and turned to see Laura's pained expression. "What's wrong?"

"I'm having stomach cramps," Laura said, her face pale and her body hunched slightly. "I've got my period and need to find a restroom."

"Do you want me to come with you?"

"No, no need," Laura waved her off quickly. "I might be a while. You should go ahead and see Mr. Nelson. I'll catch up with you later."

"What about you?"

"I'll join you as soon as I can," Laura said, grabbing her bag and quickly exiting the car.

Though Isabella was concerned, she understood the urgency of meeting Nathaniel. She resumed driving toward his place.

Hiding under the dense trees, Laura watched as Isabella drove away, then let out a sigh of relief. Just as she was about to step out, she noticed a car following Isabella.

Laura's heart skipped a beat. She thought, 'Are we being followed?'

Inside Nathaniel's home, Isabella didn't get to meet him directly. Instead, a servant from the Nelson family greeted her, offering coffee and pastries before leaving her alone in the sitting room.

The hospitality was courteous but clearly implied that a meeting wasn't on the cards.

As Isabella was about to leave after waiting for a while, two women entered the room.

One of them was Emma.

The other woman, who was with Emma, turned out to be Ophelia, Nathaniel's wife.

The two women chatted and laughed as they walked in. When Ophelia noticed Isabella, she looked puzzled and turned to the servant.

The servant quickly explained, "Mrs. Nelson, this is Ms. Miller. She says she represents the Landon Group."

Ophelia's finely arched eyebrows rose in curiosity as she scrutinized Isabella more closely. "The Landon Group," she repeated, her gaze sharp and assessing.

Realizing who Ophelia was, Isabella promptly stood up and introduced herself, "Hello, Mrs. Nelson. I'm Isabella."

Ophelia glanced down, her eyes passing over the hand Isabella had extended, but she made no move to shake it. With a cool demeanor, she said, "You're here about the shares, aren't you?"

Isabella awkwardly withdrew her hand and nodded. "Yes. I understand Mr. Nelson has always been a strong supporter of the Landon Group. I'd like to discuss the matter of the shares with him in person."

"But he refuses to see you,"Â Ophelia said with a thin smile, her tone sharp. "I'm aware he intends to sell his shares."

Recalling the term "henpecked husband,"Â Isabella pressed on. "May I ask your opinion on this matter?"

"Me?"Â Ophelia exchanged a glance with Emma. "Investing and making money are men's affairs; I've never been involved. I didn't interfere when he chose to invest in a company with nothing to show for it, and I won't interfere now that he wants to sell his shares. So, Ms. Miller, trying to work through me won't get you anywhere."

Ophelia then signaled for the maid to show Isabella out and turned to Emma. "I recently bought a new set of jewelry and I'm not quite sure how to style it. You always have a good eye-why don't you help me figure it out today?"

Emma smiled and nodded. "Sure, I'd be happy to."

As they began to head upstairs, Isabella suddenly stepped in front of Ophelia, blocking her path.

"Mrs. Nelson, I only want to meet Mr. Nelson for a few minutes. I have some questions I need to ask him in person. Could you please arrange for us to meet? It won't take long; I just need a definitive answer."

Ophelia's face darkened, and her irritation was evident. "Ms. Miller, I believe someone should have informed you about basic manners. If Nathaniel doesn't want to see you, I fully respect his decision. Trying to influence him through me is pointless."

"Mrs. Nelson..."Â Isabella began to protest, but Ophelia waved her off impatiently. A maid stepped forward and gently ushered Isabella away.

"Let's go,"Â Ophelia said to Emma, who hesitated for a moment before casting a meaningful look back at Isabella. Then she followed Ophelia up the stairs.

Isabella found herself effectively dismissed from the Nelson household.

Laura had been waiting outside and hurried over. "How did it go?"

Isabella shook her head, her expression clouded with disappointment.

It was a failed attempt; she hadn't even seen Nathaniel.

Laura bit her lip and then noticed a silver-gray car parked nearby. She tugged on Isabella's sleeve. "I saw that car following you earlier."

Isabella glanced at the car, her frustration deepening. "Let's check it out."

Isabella squinted at the car Laura was pointing at. "It's Emma's car."

Remembering the close rapport between Emma and Ophelia from earlier at the Nelsons' and the knowing look Emma had given her, Isabella furrowed her brow. It seemed like she had understood Emma's unspoken message.

"Let's go,"Â Laura urged, trying to pull her along.

Isabella shook her head. "We wait a bit longer."

"Wait?"Â Laura glanced at the closed gate, puzzled. "Wait for what?"

Isabella replied, "We wait for Emma."

Her instinct told her Emma might be able to help. Whether or not Emma would be willing or able to assist would only become clear after they met.

As if on cue, the gate of the Nelson estate opened, and Emma walked out.

"There she is!"Â Laura said excitedly. She turned to see Isabella calmly seated in the driver's seat, her eyes fixed on the scene ahead without any intention of moving or getting out of the car.

Laura asked, "Aren't we getting out?"

Isabella didn't respond.

Emma paused at the entrance of the Nelson estate, glanced briefly in their direction, and then got into the silver-gray car.

Isabella started the engine and followed right behind.

###chapter 274 I Want My Daughter

"Where are we going now?" Laura asked, concerned.

"We follow her,"Â Isabella replied.

"Do you know where she's going?"

Isabella paused for a moment before saying, "I have a hunch." Laura's curiosity was piqued even more, so she pressed on, "Where to?"

Turning the corner, they were greeted by a large building. Isabella glanced at the building and nodded slightly. "We're here."

Laura turned her head and stared through the windshield at the hospital's building.

Meanwhile, Emma's car had already passed through the gate and turned left into the hospital's underground parking lot.

Isabella followed quickly.

Once they were in the underground parking lot, the light became much dimmer, and after two turns, they saw Emma waiting by the elevator.

Emma had alighted from her car as soon as Isabella's approached, and her gaze had been following the car, as if she were deliberately waiting for them.

Isabella parked the car nearby, unbuckled her seatbelt, and walked towards Emma.

"Isabella, you're here," Emma smiled. "Matthew has been wanting to see you. He'll be thrilled if he knows you're here." With that, she turned and pressed the elevator button.

Isabella looked at her and asked, "Are you friends with Mrs. Nelson?"

Emma didn't answer the question directly, but instead smiled and handed Isabella a paper bag. "This is Matthew's favorite. I'll leave it to you, Bella, to personally deliver it to him."

Since Matthew was rushed to the hospital, Emma had called Isabella repeatedly, using every method available to persuade her to visit Matthew. Isabella had taken Emma's number off the blacklist only after Samantha was arrested, having told Matthew to die during one of those calls.

Today, when Isabella went to find Nathaniel, her guess about Emma's intentions was confirmed.

Isabella didn't reach out to grab the paper bag. "Mrs. Landon, if you want me to visit Matthew, besides convincing Ophelia to help me, I also need to know where my daughter is."

"Bella, I'm truly sorry about your daughter. I may not be able to help, but as long as you visit Matthew, I guarantee I'll help find her."Â Emma was earnest.

Isabella locked eyes with her for a moment before breaking into a smile. "Mrs. Landon, would I fall for the same trick twice? If you really want me to see Matthew, stop using these empty assurances to fool me."

"Bella..."

"I want my daughter back, and Ophelia's help. Without either, I won't be visiting Matthew. Even if you manage to force me there, remember, I can bring Matthew back to life, and I can just as easily take it away from him again."

Emma's expression was complex as she struggled to speak, "All I know is that Charles initially planned to send your daughter to Emerald Isle City. However, something went wrong, and she disappeared. Not just me, Charles himself isn't sure where your daughter ended up."

"Emerald Isle City?"Â Isabella frowned, completely puzzled about the connection between Lakina and Emerald Isle City.

Without waiting for her to ask, Emma said, "Emerald Isle City is Anna's hometown. I've actually been discreetly sending people to look for your daughter, and Sebastian has also sent a team there. Didn't he tell you?"

Isabella was at a loss for words. She couldn't determine the truth of Emma's statements at the moment, and Sebastian had only mentioned Seaside City, not Emerald Isle City. This was something she'd need to confirm with Sebastian later.

Emma continued, "That's all I know for now. If you're concerned about Ophelia, I can call her right now and arrange a meeting for you."

She pulled out her phone and began dialing.

Isabella watched quietly, not stopping her.

The phone rang a few times before it was answered, and Ophelia's voice came through, "Emma, why did you leave so soon? I just changed into the outfits you picked out for me and didn't get a chance to show you. But honestly, you have great taste-I've loved everything you chose for me."

"I'm glad you like them,"Â Emma responded. "Actually, I know Ms. Miller, who was looking for Nathaniel at your place earlier. Ophelia, could you do me a favor and let Nathaniel meet with her?"

"You know her?"Â Ophelia sounded surprised. "Why didn't you mention that earlier?"

"I wasn't sure of the details, and it didn't seem appropriate to get involved. After leaving your place, I asked her, and she only wants to meet with Nathaniel. I've already promised to help her, so I'm asking you now."

There was a pause on the other end as Ophelia held the phone in one hand and adjusted her dress in front of the full-length mirror, eventually giving in, "Alright. Given our long-standing friendship and all the help you've given me with my outfits, I'll let Nathaniel meet with her. But just so you know, I won't be involved in any business matters. Whether they make a deal or not is up to Ms. Miller's skills."

"Understood,"Â Emma nodded. "I'll let her know when Nathaniel is available."

"Great."

After a few more pleasantries, the call ended.

Emma turned to Isabella, "Is that okay now?"

"Thanks."Â Isabella finally took the paper bag from Emma and stepped into the elevator.

Matthew was still under scrutiny, even while hospitalized. There was always someone stationed at the ward door. His movements were restricted to the ward itself, and anyone visiting had to go through a process, including registration and security checks. Not only were dangerous items prohibited, but even phones were not allowed.

Due to these restrictions, only one visitor was allowed in at a time.

As Isabella pushed open the door, she was immediately hit by the strong scent of disinfectant.

The window in the hospital room was only cracked open a tiny slit. Matthew lay in the bed, and he looked even worse than before.

Isabella was struck with shock the moment she saw him.

His hair was disheveled, his face gaunt and skeletal, his eyes deeply sunken, and his overall appearance was weary and haggard. The man in the bed bore no resemblance to the Matthew she remembered; he seemed like a stranger entirely.

At the sound of footsteps, Matthew opened his eyes. For a moment, his dull gaze fixed on Isabella standing at the foot of the bed with a look of confusion.

But as soon as he recognized her face, it was as if a surge of energy flowed through him. Matthew shot up from the bed in a sudden, forceful movement, causing himself and the sheets to tumble to the floor. The needle in his hand was yanked out, leaving splatters of blood on the pristine white sheets.

Before Isabella could recover from her shock, Matthew was already at her side, pulling her into his embrace with a desperate urgency.

###chapter 275 Damnable

Isabella smelled the disinfectant on him, frowned, and pushed him away.

But Matthew held on too tightly, and her push had no effect, so she increased the force, pushing hard.

Unexpectedly, Matthew lost his balance and stumbled, hitting the bed frame.

But Matthew seemed unaware of the pain; his eyes still fixed on Isabella, the red veins in his eyes looking terrifying.

He paused for a moment, then reached out again, trying to hold Isabella's hand.

But Isabella was quicker. Seeing him reach out, she quickly stepped back several steps, the wariness in her eyes and the fear on her face stinging Matthew.

Isabella avoided his gaze and asked, "What happened to you?"

Matthew was stunned, touched his cheek with his hand, and turned his head away in shame.

He thought he must look terrible now!

And his worst side was shown to the person he loved the most.

Before entering the room, Emma had informed Isabella that Matthew had lost his ability to speak after a nail injured his vocal cords. Isabella felt no sympathy for him, not after what Charles and Emma had done. Still, seeing Matthew in such a state stirred a pang of pity.

Recalling Emma's request, she handed him the bag of food she had brought.

Seeing the familiar pattern on the bag, a flicker of life returned to Matthew's eyes. He clutched the bag tightly, his gratitude evident despite his inability to speak.

Worried about any further outbursts, Isabella quickly withdrew her hand and said, "Emma sent me to check on you."

The mention of Emma elicited little reaction from Matthew. He sat by the bed, opened the bag, and pulled out some food. As he bit into it, he chewed silently, savoring the taste.

Perhaps it was the food's flavor that finally brought a semblance of a smile to his otherwise grim face. He lifted his hand and gave a thumbs-up, a silent but heartfelt thank you.

Isabella took a seat in a nearby chair and began, "Matthew, Samantha has been arrested."

Matthew paused mid-bite but continued eating, showing little interest in her news.

Isabella pressed on, "After you went to prison, a lot happened. Charles used Samantha to take away Sebastian and my child. He's been relentlessly targeting Sebastian, driving us into a corner. Charles, he's truly despicable!"

Her voice was edged with bitterness, especially when she thought of Sweetie. The pain was palpable, and she felt helpless.

Lost in her own turmoil, she didn't notice that Matthew had stopped eating and was quietly observing her.

Suddenly, voices from outside the door broke the silence. Isabella thought she heard Charles'Â voice.

Just then, the door to the hospital room swung open from the outside, and a police officer hurriedly informed Isabella that her visiting time was up and she had to leave.

The next visitor was Charles.

Isabella rose and walked straight out without a backward glance. Matthew's gaze followed her, hoping she might pause to look at him, but she didn't even turn around.

As Isabella's figure vanished from sight, the spark in Matthew's eyes seemed to fade along with her departure. He lowered his head, staring at the half-eaten food in his hands, lost in thought.

Moments later, the mattress beside Matthew shifted as Charles sat down and gently patted his shoulder. "Matthew, I've been swamped lately and haven't had a chance to visit. How are you holding up?"

Matthew slowly lifted his head and met Charles'Â gaze, nodding slowly after a pause.

Charles, now embodying a fatherly figure, looked at Matthew with a warm, loving smile. "Tomorrow's my birthday. You've always sung me 'Happy Birthday'Â every year. It's a shame we can't do it this year."

Charles sighed and added, "But that's okay. In a few months, you'll be out. When you're home, we'll definitely make up for the birthday celebration, right?"

Matthew looked at Charles and nodded again, though his expression remained subdued.

Charles felt a sense of change in Matthew, though he couldn't quite pinpoint what had shifted. Given everything Matthew had been through, some change was understandable.

Charles leaned in and gave Matthew a hug. "When you're out, I'll hand over the Landon Group to you. You're my son and the heir to the Landon family. Don't worry, no one's going to take it from you-Sebastian's share included. Consider it his way of making amends."

This time, Matthew didn't respond with a nod.

Instead, he lowered his head once more and continued eating his food in silence.

Charles left the room shortly after, and outside, only Emma remained.

"Where's Isabella?"Â Charles asked.

"She's already left,"Â Emma replied.

Despite being married for decades, they now felt like strangers. Their conversation was as cold as the space between them: a question and an answer, devoid of warmth.

Charles glanced at Emma and said, "The visiting hours are over. Come with me. There are still details for tomorrow's party that need your attention as the hostess."

Emma didn't reply but followed him out.

In the underground parking garage, the driver opened the back seat door. Charles got in first, and Emma followed behind.

Before the car door closed, Charles turned to the driver and said, "Wait outside for a moment. I need to have a word with her."

"Understood, Mr. Landon." The driver nodded, then closed the door and stepped outside to wait.

As soon as the door was shut, Charles raised his hand and slapped Emma hard across the face.

In the confined space of the car, the sound was shockingly loud.

Emma staggered from the blow and slammed against the car door, causing another muffled thud.

Charles adjusted his cufflinks, his face contorted with anger, and coldly demanded, "Who allowed Isabella to come?"

Emma, still reeling from the slap, leaned against the car door, trying to catch her breath.

Charles pressed on, "Didn't I tell you not to let Isabella near Matthew?"

Emma finally gathered her composure and, with her head bowed, explained, "Matthew is going home tomorrow. I just wanted to fulfill his wish before he leaves. He's been wanting to see Isabella."

"Isabella? Is she some kind of deity?"Â Charles snapped, his voice echoing with fury in the car. "Is it so impossible for you to manage Matthew without her? If Matthew's lost his mind over her, must you lose yours too?"

Emma kept her head down, silent and submissive.

Once he'd finished venting, Charles rolled down the window and signaled the driver to get back in.

He then grabbed a couple of tissues, wiped Emma's face, and, with a cold edge to his voice, said, "Emma, you better not cause any more trouble."

As the car pulled away, Isabella and Laura stepped out from behind a pillar where they had been hiding.

###chapter 276 Far More Sinister

The two women watched the car disappear into the distance. Laura, still feeling shaken, patted her chest and said, "Charles usually seems so cultured and refined. Who knew he had such a violent side? Even through the closed window, you could hear his shouting."

Indeed, although they hadn't witnessed the scene inside the car, the sounds they had heard made it clear that Charles had been yelling at Emma. From the driver's nonchalant expression, it was evident that such outbursts were not unusual.

Isabella turned to Laura and asked, "Did you see Emma's face?"

Laura looked puzzled for a moment, then shook her head. "No, I didn't notice. Why, did you see something?"

Isabella pressed her lips together, choosing not to answer. When the window had come down earlier, she had caught a glimpse of Emma's face, which was bruised and swollen. This suggested that Charles'Â anger wasn't confined to words; he had likely been physical with Emma as well.

In the past, Isabella would have found it hard to believe such a thing about Charles. But now, she felt that in a fit of rage, he could have seriously killed Emma.

At that moment, Isabella realized that the true nature of Charles might be far more sinister than she had ever imagined.

After Isabella and Laura returned home and took care of some work, the sky had darkened by the time Isabella looked up.

Nina had come over with ingredients to cook dinner for Isabella.

Laura, who had already tasted Nina's cooking and found it excellent, followed her into the kitchen, eager to learn.

Isabella, reclining on the sofa, smiled to herself. The conversation with Emma earlier about Emerald Isle City had left her with questions. While she was busy, she could push those thoughts aside, but now, with time to spare, her mind wandered.

Unable to resist, Isabella picked up her phone and dialed Sebastian.

Just as she was about to hit the call button, her phone rang with an incoming call.

She answered, placing the phone to her ear. "Sebastian."

"Bella, have you eaten yet?"Â Sebastian's voice, though tired, carried a note of warmth.

Hearing his voice, Isabella couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy. "Nina just arrived and is cooking now. How's your business meeting going? Are you coming back soon?"

Sebastian's exhaustion seemed to lift a bit at her concern. "It's going fairly well. I do have to meet with an important client tonight, though. We're still on Fog Island, so I won't be able to make it back tonight. Nina will keep you company, and I'll be back tomorrow after I wrap up."

Isabella didn't want him to worry, so she agreed readily. "Okay. You take care of yourself too."

She had intended to tell Sebastian about the day's events: Nathaniel, her meeting with Matthew, Emma's promises, and Emma's mention that Sweetie might be in Emerald Isle City.

But before she could say anything, Jack's voice came through on Sebastian's end, urging him on. "Mr. Landon, these documents need your review. In half an hour, we have to discuss them with the client. Can you check the marked details one more time?"

Sebastian cast a questioning look at Jack. "Haven't you already reviewed these?"

Jack, Sebastian's most trusted assistant who had been with him for years, was known for his competence and reliability. In other words, Sebastian rarely had to worry about crucial matters because Jack handled them with expertise.

Usually, small tasks like document review were well within Jack's abilities. So when Jack asked Sebastian to review the documents himself, it seemed unusual.

Jack glanced at his phone and said, "This deal is critical, so I think it's best if you look over some details yourself."

That made sense under the circumstances.

Isabella had overheard Jack's comment. Considering the immense pressure Sebastian was under and his eyes still not fully recovered, she decided to hold off on bringing up the day's events. She figured it was best to wait until Sebastian returned, which would be no later than tomorrow.

"I'm good, Sebastian. I'll see you when you get back,"Â Isabella said.

"Alright,"Â Sebastian replied.

After ending the call, Sebastian flipped through the documents and reviewed the marked details. Frowning, he said, "You've already highlighted these details clearly. Why do I need to review them again?"

Jack looked down and replied, "It's better to be thorough. We can't afford any mistakes."

Sebastian snapped the file shut and scrutinized Jack with a piercing gaze. "Jack, did you deliberately interrupt my call with Bella?"

Jack froze for a moment, but his expression remained neutral. "Mr. Landon, I've been with you since college, watching you build the Landon Group from the ground up. At a critical moment like this, I don't want anything to distract you, not even Isabella."

Sebastian's brow furrowed. "When did you develop such reservations about Isabella?"

"I don't have reservations about her. I just don't want you to abandon the Landon Group easily. It's your creation, after all,"Â Jack insisted.

From Jack's perspective, his concerns were understandable.

Still, Sebastian couldn't shake his doubts about Jack's true intentions.

Just then, the doorbell rang. "Mr. Landon, Ms. Stewart has arrived."

In the hotel's dining room, the setting was elegant. The room had been cleared in advance, leaving only the soft strains of a piano playing in the background.

As the last notes faded, a woman in a black dress gracefully stood up. Like a black swan, she descended the glass-like stairs with measured steps. Despite being in her forties or fifties, she carried an air of youthful grace.

Jack pulled out a chair for her as the woman settled in, elegantly removing her white velvet gloves and placing them aside. With a warm smile directed at Sebastian across the table, she said, "Mr. Landon, you look even younger and more charming than I imagined."

Sebastian offered a polite smile in return. "You're too kind, Ms. Stewart."

She handed him a sleek black business card embossed with her full name: Esme Stewart.

"I understand you reached out to my assistant about investing in the Landon Group?"Â Sebastian said, placing the card down. "I'm curious, considering Ms. Stewart just returned from abroad, why would you choose to invest in a company that's facing so many challenges?"

Esme took a sip from her glass of juice and smiled coolly. "Before making this decision, I did a comprehensive analysis of the Landon Group. You've built the company from scratch and brought it to this height, which speaks volumes about your capabilities. Had I approached you for investment before the Landon Group hit its rough patch, you'd likely have turned me down. Now that I'm here to offer a lifeline, I assume you'll be more receptive. After all, business is essentially a gamble. If you win, you celebrate; if you lose, you chalk it up to experience."

Her casual demeanor suggested confidence, but Sebastian only chuckled softly and replied, "I'm afraid I might have to disappoint you, Ms. Stewart."

Esme paused, tilting her striking gaze toward him, intrigued.

###chapter 277 Ms. Stewart

Esme and Sebastian locked eyes for a moment before she asked, "Mr. Landon, are you really going to turn me down?"

Sebastian maintained his steady gaze and replied, "It seems Ms. Stewart is unfazed by the rejection?"

Esme smiled lightly. "When you're in business, you anticipate the possibility of rejection. But may I ask why? Given that the Landon Group is in such dire need of funding, shouldn't you be more inclined to accept my offer rather than push me away?"

Sebastian hesitated for a moment before responding, "Do you want the honest truth?"

"Of course,"Â Esme said.

"It's simply because I don't know enough about you,"Â Sebastian explained. "I detest being manipulated. Without a clearer understanding of your true intentions, I'm not willing to take the risk of bringing you on board."

In other words, while Esme's investment could indeed help the Landon Group through its crisis, the risks involved were significant. Who was to say she wouldn't turn out to be another Nathaniel?

Backstabbing and control-Sebastian was determined not to face that again. In the past, he could afford to be ruthless and single-minded, but things were different now. He was a husband and a father, and he needed to be more cautious than ever, as he wanted to provide a stable future for Isabella and Sweetie.

Esme regarded Sebastian with a trace of admiration in her eyes.

Sebastian stood up, gave a slight nod to Esme, and said, "I have another engagement. Please, enjoy your meal. I'll have my assistant take care of the bill."

With that, Sebastian picked up his coat from the back of his chair and exited the restaurant.

Jack followed quickly, his face etched with concern. "Mr. Landon, why pass up such a golden opportunity? Esme's funding could be exactly what we need. Don't you think you should reconsider?"

"Reconsider what?"Â Sebastian asked, stopping by the elevator and turning to face him.

"Reconsider accepting Esme's offer!"Â Jack urged.

"Do you know anything about her?"

"I can look into it."

"Definitely need to,"Â Sebastian replied, narrowing his eyes. He had the unsettling feeling that Esme's appearance was too calculated, too sudden. After meeting her today, he sensed no immediate hostility, but he needed to be sure of her intentions.

In the restaurant, Esme sipped her red wine with an air of graceful composure.

A young man, strikingly handsome and about the same age as Sebastian, emerged from behind the piano. He approached Esme's table and stopped, asking, "Did you get turned down?"

Esme smiled, "Quentin, you guessed correctly."

She set down her wine glass and inquired, "How are things with Nathaniel? When's the deal going to happen?"

"We've scheduled for tomorrow,"Â Quentin replied. "She visited Nathaniel today at the Nelson Family estate and will likely be at the transaction site tomorrow. Do you want to go?"

Esme remained silent, her smile fading slightly as she continued to sip her wine. Beneath the surface, a trace of worry lingered in her eyes.

Quentin, understanding her unspoken concern, gave a slight nod. "I'll make arrangements."

Esme nodded back and then remembered something. "Elodie has gone off the rails again. I suspect she's looking for Richard. Make sure someone keeps an eye on her and prevents any trouble."

Quentin shook his head in frustration. "You know how obsessed she is with Richard. I can't control her."

Esme was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Nina had prepared a meal, and she, Isabella, and Laura had a bite together.

Laura was practically bouncing with excitement. "This is so good!"

"This one's amazing too!"Â she added, savoring each dish.

The once-quiet house was now filled with a lively buzz, thanks to Laura's enthusiastic commentary.

Isabella couldn't help but laugh. "You've been in the kitchen the whole time-did you learn anything?"

Laura stopped in her tracks.

She fiddled with her fork and admitted sheepishly, "I think I was so focused on when I could eat that I completely forgot about the cooking process."

Nina and Isabella laughed.

After dinner, Laura left first.

Nina and Isabella settled on the couch for a chat. Just as they were getting into the conversation, the doorbell rang.

Isabella hurried to answer it, with Nina trailing behind. When they opened the door, they saw a man in black standing outside with a black car parked in the driveway.

The man nodded politely to Nina and said, "Richard sent me to pick you up."

Nina looked at him and asked, "Where's Richard?"

The man's face showed a hint of hesitation. "Richard had an unexpected incident."

Nina's concern grew. "What happened?"

The man took a deep breath before revealing, "Richard's been injured and is in a critical condition. I was sent to bring you to him. Richard didn't want me to say anything."

Nina's heart skipped a beat. She pulled out her phone to call Richard but found she couldn't get a signal.

Seeing her distress, the man added, "The doctor is currently treating Richard. He's asking for you."

"Okay!"Â Nina barely paused to think. Her mind was flooded with images of Richard hurt, and her heart raced with anxiety.

Isabella took her hand and squeezed it gently. "Nina, don't panic. Richard will be alright."

"Mm."Â Nina nodded, though her face remained pale.

She was deeply worried about Richard.

Nina herself didn't quite understand when her concern for Richard had reached such a level.

She got into the car, and it drove away.

Inside the car, Nina continued trying to reach Richard, but the call was perpetually blocked, as if the signal was being interfered with.

At the same time, she noticed a faint, pleasant fragrance filling the air. Looking up, she saw white mist emerging from the air conditioning vents, quickly enveloping the car. As the scent filled her senses, Nina's head started to spin. Before she lost consciousness, she saw the driver with one hand on the wheel and the other covering his mouth and nose with a cloth.

Nina barely had time to struggle before everything went dark.

The driver then opened the car windows to let the strange scent dissipate and drove the car to the Starlight Hotel.

The next day, Emma called to inform Isabella that Nathaniel would be at the Blue Horizon Cafe for a meeting.

Isabella wasted no time and headed straight to the venue.

Just like last time, as they were about to enter, Laura mentioned needing to use the restroom.

Isabella gave her a puzzled look. Laura avoided her gaze.

Noticing Laura's odd behavior, Isabella felt something was off but chose not to comment. She agreed to let Laura go to the restroom and proceeded to Nathaniel's reserved private room.

Isabella knocked on the door.

A deep, authoritative male voice called from inside, "Come in."

Isabella entered to find the room filled with the aroma of coffee. A middle-aged man was seated at the table. Although Isabella had never met Nathaniel in person, she recognized him immediately from photos.

"Mr. Nelson."

Nathaniel looked up, a trace of surprise on his face. "And you are?"

"I'm Isabella. I'm here on behalf of Mr. Landon."

At the mention of Landon, Nathaniel's expression darkened. "I have nothing more to discuss with Sebastian. If you're here for the shares, let me be clear: there's nothing to talk about."

###chapter 278 She Was Completely Confused

Isabella hadn't expected Nathaniel to be so adamant. His tone, especially when he mentioned Sebastian, was not that of a longtime partner but rather carried a hint of bitterness.

Caught off guard, Isabella realized her prepared arguments were useless. She decided to cut to the chase. "Since Mr. Nelson isn't interested in hearing the usual pitch, I won't waste time. I'll be blunt: if Mr. Landon were to agree to match whatever Charles promised you, even double it, would there be any chance to salvage this?"

Isabella wasn't clear on what exactly Charles had promised Nathaniel, but that was beside the point. What mattered was whether there was any room for negotiation. If she could make a breakthrough, there was hope. Everything else could be sorted out later.

Nathaniel smirked, his expression dripping with disdain. "Isn't Sebastian all about using women as shields? And now he's sending his woman to negotiate? Typical. He's always been good at playing the lovesick fool, but when it comes down to it, he's no different from the rest."

As he spoke, Nathaniel's gaze swept over Isabella from head to toe. "I've heard about the drama with the Landon family. They've fought tooth and nail for you. I thought you must be something special, but it turns out you're just ordinary."

Isabella felt a flush of embarrassment at Nathaniel's derogatory comments. "Mr. Nelson, you're a man of position and influence. How can you speak like a common thug?"

Nathaniel chuckled, "You're right about one thing. I used to be a thug, a streetwise gangster. Unlike Sebastian, who's always pretending, I'm real."

Isabella frowned, finally understanding why Sebastian had warned her about Nathaniel's stubbornness.

She had assumed that Nathaniel's investment in the Landon Group meant he was a visionary and respectable businessman. The real Nathaniel, however, was far from the image she had imagined.

Nathaniel stood up from his chair and walked slowly toward Isabella. He circled her, his gaze lecherous. "The Landon family must be desperate. A woman with your build? Even if you were naked, I wouldn't be interested!"

Isabella's face burned with anger. She raised her hand to slap Nathaniel, but he grabbed her wrist, pulling her closer. "But Sebastian's woman? That's something I'm quite interested in."

Nathaniel's eyes gleamed with mockery. To him, Isabella was not just a woman but a tool for revenge against Sebastian.

"Ms. Miller, how about you join me?"Â Nathaniel's gaze was fixed on her face, his contempt growing more pronounced.

Isabella could hardly believe her ears. Staring at Nathaniel in disbelief, she managed a scornful laugh. "Mr. Nelson, let's be blunt. You could be my father! Are you really out here chasing women? Afraid you might lose your dentures in the process?"

Nathaniel's smile turned dark. "Ms. Miller, if you want to negotiate, you need to show some sincerity. Agree to be with me, and I might reluctantly reconsider the shares in the Landon Group."

Isabella felt a surge of revulsion. "Mr. Nelson, you truly make my skin crawl!"

She struggled to free her hand, but Nathaniel's grip was unyielding.

Noticing a faint, milky scent on Isabella, Nathaniel remarked, "I heard you recently had a baby. You're still breastfeeding, aren't you? There's a hint of milk on you."

As Nathaniel reached for Isabella's waist, making a move to embrace her, she let out a terrified scream.

At that moment, the door to the private room was pushed open, and a tall figure stood in the doorway.

Nathaniel immediately released Isabella, regaining his composure and walking briskly toward the man. "Mr. Black, I've been waiting for you."

Quentin glanced briefly at Nathaniel before his gaze settled on Isabella, who was still visibly shaken.

Nathaniel turned back to Isabella with a dismissive wave. "Ms. Miller, I'm about to conduct business. Please leave immediately!"

Humiliated and angered, Isabella fought to stay calm. She recognized Quentin as the same man she had encountered at Blue Horizon Cafe.

She thought, 'So, instead of Charles, the person Nathaniel is meeting today, was this Quentin?'

"Where's Charles?"Â Isabella asked, her voice trembling.

Nathaniel's irritation was evident. "Charles? I never said I was meeting Charles today."

"Aren't you supposed to sell the shares to Charles?"

"Who said I'm selling to Charles? Ms. Miller, I'm giving you one more minute to leave!"

Isabella remained rooted to the spot, her mind racing.

She had always assumed Charles was the one buying the Landon Group shares, and now this unexpected Quentin had appeared.

Seeing that Isabella wasn't moving, Nathaniel issued an ultimatum. "Ms. Miller, if you don't leave now, I'll have you forcibly removed!"

"Mr. Nelson,"Â Quentin interjected smoothly, "I prefer to do business with people who are polite."

Nathaniel looked momentarily taken aback. "I apologize, Mr. Black. This woman has been persistent. I'll have her removed right away."

"No need,"Â Quentin said, raising a hand. He then turned his warm gaze to Isabella. "Miss, we have something quite important to discuss. Could you please step outside for a moment?"

Isabella was taken aback. His politeness threw her off balance.

She left the private room and headed to the restroom.

Under the running water, she scrubbed her hands repeatedly, as if trying to wash away any trace of Nathaniel's touch, convinced there might be some terrible virus clinging to her. After scrubbing so vigorously that her wrists were nearly raw, she finally stopped. She dried her hands with a paper towel, pulled her sleeve down to cover the irritated area, and composed herself.

When she exited the restroom, she considered returning to the private room. Even though she felt powerless to change anything, she was eager to find out whether Nathaniel had sold the shares or not. If Quentin had indeed acquired the Landon Group shares, he would become, after Sebastian, the largest shareholder of the company.

She reasoned that as long as the shares weren't going to Charles, a new shareholder shouldn't be too much of an issue.

Just as Isabella stepped out, she noticed a middle-aged woman slumped against the wall. Anouk Dubois was clutching her chest and looked to be in distress. Her purse lay open on the floor, its contents scattered around.

Isabella froze for a moment, then realized Anouk must be having a medical episode.

She hurried over and crouched in front of Anouk. "Ma'am, are you alright?"

Anouk, barely able to open her eyes, managed to croak out a single word through gritted teeth. "Medication."

"Alright,"Â Isabella replied. She rummaged through Anouk's purse and found a small white bottle. Seeing that the dosage required two pills, she retrieved them and gently placed them in Anouk's mouth.

###chapter 279 She Abandoned Me

Anouk swallowed the medication, but her condition didn't improve immediately. Leaning against the wall, she still struggled to breathe.

Isabella called for a server, and together they helped move Anouk to an empty private room.

As Anouk settled in, her breathing gradually became steadier, though her complexion remained pale.

The server brought a glass of warm water. Isabella poured a cup and gently offered it to Anouk's lips, helping her drink.

After sipping the water, Anouk slowly opened her eyes. Her eyes were strikingly beautiful, filled with a warm, engaging light as she looked at Isabella. "Did you save me?"

Isabella nodded modestly. "It was nothing. How are you feeling now? Any better?"

Anouk gave a slight nod. "I'm feeling much better. Thank you, dear."

Isabella nodded in response, standing up to leave, but Anouk grasped her hand tightly.

Anouk's grip was firm, almost desperate, as if she was afraid Isabella might walk away.

Isabella hesitated, then explained, "I'll get a towel for you to wipe off the sweat."

Anouk's anxiety eased a bit. She gave a sheepish smile and released Isabella's hand.

Isabella returned with a dampened towel and began gently wiping the sweat from Anouk's forehead. As she did, she pointed to the purse on the nearby chair. "This is your bag. You might want to check it to make sure nothing's missing."

"No need,"Â Anouk said, her voice relaxed. "It's just some insignificant stuff. Losing it doesn't matter."

Isabella was taken aback. From what she had picked up, besides a phone, the cosmetics and jewelry, along with the purse itself, were quite valuable. Losing any of these would be a significant loss, but Anouk seemed indifferent.

However, it made sense-after all, for someone wealthy, money might not be a big deal. It was people like Isabella, who struggled with every penny, that felt the sting of loss.

"What's your name?"Â Anouk asked, looking at her with genuine curiosity.

"Isabella Miller."

Anouk smiled warmly. "That's a lovely name."

Isabella paused, then added, "Nina says it's the name my mother gave me."

Anouk's eyes flickered with a shadow of sadness, but Isabella was too absorbed in her own thoughts to notice.

"I'm sorry if I've made you uncomfortable,"Â Isabella said, feeling a bit awkward.

She rarely talked about her parents, as those memories were painful scars. Even with Nina, she seldom brought them up. Yet, she found herself unexpectedly sharing this now.

Anouk studied Isabella's expression closely. "Is your mother no longer around?"

Isabella shook her head. "I'm not sure. She might still be out there, or she might not be."

"I never met her. She abandoned me."

"No, she didn't abandon you!"Â Anouk's voice took on an emotional edge, her eyes misting over with a trace of urgency, as if she was on the verge of revealing something important.

But when Isabella looked at her, Anouk quickly looked away, trying to compose herself. "What I mean is, no mother would willingly leave her child behind. Your mother might have had her reasons."

Isabella sensed that something was off with Anouk, but before she could ponder it further, the door to the private room swung open. The server ushered in a tall, imposing man.

"Mom,"Â the man said, walking briskly to Anouk's side. "Are you alright?"

Anouk shook her head, reassuring him, "I'm fine. Thanks to Ms. Miller here, who saved me when she happened to pass by."

Only then did the man turn his attention to Isabella.

Isabella stood up, offering a polite nod. "Hello, Mr. Black."

It was then she realized the man before her was none other than Quentin Black-the very same person she had seen discussing business with Nathaniel just minutes ago.

Isabella couldn't believe how small the world could be.

Quentin extended his hand. "Hello, I'm Quentin Black."

Considering Quentin's potential acquisition of the Landon Group's shares, Isabella quickly shook his hand. "I'm Isabella."

"Ms. Miller, thank you for saving my mother,"Â Quentin said warmly.

"It was nothing,"Â Isabella replied hesitantly. "Mr. Black, may I ask you a question?"

"Certainly. As long as it's within my knowledge, I'll answer honestly."

"Did the deal with Nathaniel go through?"

Quentin smirked. "That's a matter of business confidentiality."

Isabella was taken aback by his response.

"However,"Â Quentin continued, "since Ms. Miller saved my mother, and I did promise to be open, I'll tell you this: the deal is done. Nathaniel has sold me 20% of the Landon Group's shares."

"May I ask another question?"Â Isabella inquired.

"Go ahead."

"Why did you buy the Landon Group's shares? Do you know Charles?"

Quentin exchanged a glance with Anouk, then smiled. "Regarding your first question, it's related to my mother, so you should ask her directly. As for the second, I can assure you that we have no ties with Charles. The decision to acquire the Landon Group's shares was entirely my mother's."

Isabella breathed a sigh of relief. As long as they weren't affiliated with Charles'Â group, she felt things were under control.

Isabella's curiosity about their motives got the better of her, so she turned to Anouk. "To be honest, Mr. Landon from the Landon Group is my fiancÃ©. I came here today to persuade Nathaniel not to sell his shares because I thought he was dealing with Charles. Lady, if it's not too much trouble, could you tell me whether you're on friendly terms with the Landon Group or not?"

Anouk gave a reassuring smile. "Rest assured, I'm definitely not an enemy of the Landon Group. The only reason I bought Nathaniel's shares was to give my daughter a welcome gift. If the Landon Group or Ms. Miller ever needs any assistance from us, just let us know. Once you're a shareholder, you're part of the family. Besides, Ms. Miller, you saved my life."

"I see,"Â Isabella said, her worries finally easing.

At that moment, the server knocked and entered, handing over a black USB drive. "Mr. Black, here's the item you requested."

Quentin took the drive and dismissed the server.

Turning back to Isabella, Quentin offered her the USB. "This is the surveillance footage from Nathaniel's room. It contains evidence of his harassment. If you need, I can assist in reporting this to the authorities and act as a witness."

Isabella was taken aback.

She hadn't expected Quentin to be so thorough in his consideration.

What shocked her even more was the realization that there was a camera in that private room.

The Blue Horizon Cafe, a popular spot where Nathaniel was a top-tier member, was known for its discretion. It was highly unlikely they would install cameras in private rooms to invade their clients' privacy-such actions would be both unethical and detrimental to their business.

So the only conclusion was that Quentin must have set up the surveillance himself.

###chapter 280  Don't Touch Her!

Isabella pondered for a moment, trying to make sense of why Quentin would have installed a camera in the private room. After all, he was there to negotiate with Nathaniel. She thought, 'Wouldn't he be worried about Nathaniel discovering the camera and potentially scuttling the deal?

'Or has Quentin already investigated Nathaniel and suspected he wasn't a straightforward character? Perhaps the surveillance was part of a broader plan, and by sheer coincidence, it had captured evidence of Nathaniel's harassment of me?'

Regardless of Nathaniel's character, the USB was now in her possession, and the decision was hers.

Isabella tightened her grip on the USB and looked at Quentin. "Are you really willing to testify for me?"

Quentin nodded firmly. "Absolutely, anytime."

Isabella tucked the USB away. "I'll think it over."

Despite Nathaniel's harsh words today, he had previously helped Sebastian and was a long-standing shareholder in the Landon Group. Although he had been unpleasant, Isabella felt there was no need to escalate things to the police just yet.

"Alright,"Â Quentin said, moving to the coffee table. He grabbed a notepad and pen, jotted down a number, and handed it to Isabella. "This is my number. Feel free to call me whenever."

Isabella raised an eyebrow at the lack of a business card, finding Quentin's old-fashioned approach endearing. She glanced at the handwritten digits and couldn't help but appreciate the gesture.

"Thanks."

Quentin glanced at his watch and said, "It's almost lunchtime. If you don't have other plans, would you join us for a meal? You saved my mother's life, and we'd like to show our gratitude."

Isabella shook her head. "I have other commitments and wouldn't want to intrude. Mr. Black, since you've bought into the Landon Group, we're likely to cross paths again. Let's save it for next time. When Sebastian returns, we'll host a proper dinner to thank you."

Quentin smiled and didn't press further. "Alright, then. I'll walk you out."

As Isabella and Quentin left the private room, Laura arrived from another part of the cafÃ©. Seeing Isabella, Laura hurried over, grabbing her and inspecting her closely. "Isabella, are you alright?"

Isabella took in Laura's concerned expression and calmly shook her head. "I'm fine."

"You scared me half to death! I was about to come in and look for you when the server told me you'd already left. I couldn't find you anywhere and was about to call the police!"Â Laura's voice carried a hint of relief mixed with her anxiety.

Turning to Quentin, Laura paused, looking him over with curiosity. "And who might this be?"

"This is Mr. Black,"Â Isabella introduced briefly, omitting details about Quentin buying the shares from Nathaniel.

Laura didn't press for more information. She exchanged polite pleasantries with Quentin before they all left Blue Horizon Cafe.

Once they were out of sight, Quentin turned back to the private room.

Just as Quentin reached the door, his phone rang.

"Mr. Black, we've got a problem!"

After dealing with Nathaniel, Isabella felt a weight lift from her shoulders. But the unresolved issue of Sweetie brought her anxiety right back.

She thought, 'Emerald Isle City-what kind of place could that be?'

Isabella and Laura had grabbed a quick bite before Laura took a cab back to the Landon Group while Isabella drove home.

As soon as she pulled into the driveway, she noticed a black car parked by the gate and Michael standing next to it, puffing away on a cigarette.

Spotting her car, Michael stubbed out his cigarette and walked over.

Isabella rolled down her window. "Michael, what are you doing here?"

"Richard sent me to pick someone up,"Â Michael replied tersely, glancing at the passenger seat.

Isabella blinked in surprise. "Pick up who?"

Michael raised an eyebrow and reluctantly said, "Nina."

Isabella's heart sank. She recalled the car that had picked up Nina the previous night. "Nina wasn't with Richard? But his people picked her up from here last night."

Michael's smile faltered. "What?"

His reaction confirmed Isabella's worst fears. Panicked, she asked, "If it wasn't Richard's people who took Nina last night, then who was it?"

"Don't know,"Â Michael said, sliding into the back seat of the car as he spoke.

Once he was seated, he turned to Isabella. "Let's head to the surveillance room."

A few minutes later, they were in the surveillance room, reviewing footage from around Sebastian's neighborhood from the previous night. The cameras were high-definition, and as they zoomed in on the faces, Michael pointed out, "That's her!"

Isabella leaned in, anxious. "Who?"

Michael glanced at her briefly. "I have a pretty good idea of who it is. Don't worry, Nina will be fine."

With that, he turned and left the room.

Isabella instructed the security guard to save the footage and send it to her.

As Isabella burst out the door, she saw Michael standing under a tree, talking on the phone.

The call was with Richard, but Isabella couldn't make out what was being said. By the time she reached him, Michael had already hung up.

"What's the situation? Where's Nina?"Â Isabella demanded.

Michael replied, "I don't have all the details yet, but I've informed Richard. He'll take care of it."

Worried sick about Nina, Isabella didn't even go inside her house. Instead, she got into Michael's car, determined to help him find Nina.

Meanwhile, after ending the call with Michael, Richard grabbed his coat and headed out. He pulled up an old contact he hadn't dialed in ages and made the call.

After a long and impatient wait, the call was automatically disconnected due to no answer.

Richard started his car and dialed again.

As he drove out of the casino, he had dialed the number about a dozen times.

Just when Richard was about to give up on reaching Elodie Black, the call finally connected.

Through the receiver, a sultry voice greeted him with a hint of playful reproach, "Richard, you finally remembered me."

Richard cut straight to the chase, skipping any pleasantries. "Is Nina with you?"

Though phrased as a question, his tone was resolute.

"Elodie!"Â Richard's voice turned icy, his tone stern. "Don't touch her!"

Elodie paused for a moment, then responded, "I do have an older woman here, but I'm not sure if it's this Nina you're talking about. Richard, I'm at the Starlight Hotel. Come find me."

"Hang tight!"Â Richard gritted out before abruptly ending the call.

He merged onto the highway, speeding towards the Starlight Hotel.

###chapter 281 Blood Boil

At the Starlight Hotel, Elodie ended the call and walked over to the round bed, where Nina lay soundly asleep. As she gazed down at Nina, Elodie's long, sharp nails traced lightly across Nina's face. With a sneer, she muttered, "Richard actually likes this?"

A knock came at the door, and shortly after, a young woman in a mask entered. Kaja Pedersen carried a tray with a white nightgown on it and stopped behind Elodie.

Elodie glanced at Kaja and instructed, "Change her into this."

With that, Elodie turned and left the room.

When Richard arrived at the Starlight Hotel, Kaja, still masked, was waiting by the door. Recognizing her instantly, Richard marched up and grabbed Kaja's arm with a fierce grip. The force made Kaja flinch, but she held back a gasp.

Kaja looked up at Richard's icy gaze and braced herself as he demanded, "Where's Elodie?"

Kaja lifted her other hand and gently patted Richard's, her eyes soft with a silent apology.

Richard snapped back to reality and released her, murmuring, "Sorry."

Kaja said nothing in response. She gave Richard one last look before turning and heading into the hotel.

Richard followed her.

In the elevator, they ascended to the top floor. Kaja guided Richard to a closed door and then stopped.

Richard pushed the door open, stepping into a pitch-black room. The door slowly closed behind him, and a faint, intoxicating fragrance filled the air. Just a few breaths of it made Richard's pulse quicken.

As someone accustomed to operating in the shadows, Richard recognized the ploy immediately. He fumbled for the wall switch, but it was malfunctioning; the room remained in darkness.

Heavy blackout curtains shut out all sunlight, leaving only a sliver of light seeping through. Richard moved swiftly towards this narrow beam and drew the curtains apart.

The sudden influx of light shattered the darkness, but the lingering, entrancing aroma still hung in the air. Richard opened a window, letting the fresh air blow in and disperse the bewitching scent.

At that moment, he felt a sudden warmth on his back as a soft, heated body pressed against him. Arms wrapped around his waist, holding him close.

Richard's reflexes were sharp. He seized the wrists and spun around, coming face-to-face with a naked body.

Elodie stood before him, completely unclothed. Despite being restrained, she leaned in closer, her breath coming in short, rapid bursts. Her face was flushed, clearly affected by the lingering scent.

"Richard, I've finally found you. I've missed you so much,"Â she breathed, her voice thick with longing.

Richard held Elodie's wrists with one hand and grabbed a blanket from the back of a chair with the other. He spread it out and draped it over Elodie's shoulders, wrapping her tightly. Then, using the edges of the blanket, he expertly tied a secure knot behind her back before pushing her down into the chair.

Leaning over the sides of the chair, Richard's cold gaze fixed on Elodie. "Tell me where Nina is."

Elodie struggled, but the blanket was constricting her too much for her to escape. She could barely move, panting heavily and sweating from the effort.

When she heard his question, Elodie paused, catching her breath. She looked up at him with a smirk. "Richard, why would you settle for someone as old as Nina? She's not worthy of you!"

"Whether she's worthy or not isn't for you to decide!"Â Richard's brow furrowed with frustration. He knew Elodie all too well and was aware of what she was capable of. Every second wasted increased Nina's risk. "Elodie, let her go. I'll pretend this never happened!"

Elodie let out a derisive laugh. Instead of answering, she glanced provocatively behind him.

Richard turned to follow her gaze, which was directed at a projector. On the large white screen, a scene from another room was being projected. The camera was focused on a round, lavishly decorated bed. As Richard saw Nina lying unconscious on the bed, his eyes widened in shock.

Nina had been dressed in a white outfit that barely qualified as sleepwear; it was more like provocative lingerie.

The camera angle shifted to reveal two men approaching the bed. Both men were only wearing black shorts, and their sinister smiles grew as they drew closer to Nina.

The screen was silent, but just seeing the scene was enough to make Richard's blood boil.

Elodie's laughter echoed in the room. "Richard, you can hold yourself together; Nina might not be able to. It's quite the show-care to join me?"

"Elodie!"Â Richard spun around and, with a powerful swing, aimed a punch at Elodie's face.

Elodie's eyes widened in fear and disbelief.

As the punch came closer, she could do nothing but watch it descend towards her. The blow stopped just inches from her face, the rush of air from the impact palpable, and her heart pounded loudly in her ears.

Richard pulled back his fist, his face a mask of restrained fury. He straightened up, gave Elodie one last icy glance, and without saying a word, stormed out of the room.

Elodie slumped into the chair, feeling like a puddle of soft, yielding clay. Her mind was consumed with the memory of Richard's gaze. If Richard had lost his composure just moments ago, or if she weren't one of the Black family, that punch would have surely landed. She could almost guarantee it would have been fatal.

"Richard."Â Elodie's voice quivered, reverberating through the empty room.

Outside, Kaja remained.

When Richard emerged, Kaja's worried expression slightly eased.

Richard ignored her, heading straight for another room in search of Nina. But despite his thorough search through the entire suite, Nina was nowhere to be found.

Just then, Richard felt a tap on his back. He turned to see Kaja standing there, gesturing rapidly. Unfortunately, Richard didn't understand sign language.

So Kaja turned and headed to the elevator, pressing the button.

When the doors opened, Kaja stepped inside, keeping the door open with the "Open"Â button pressed. Her gaze remained fixed on Richard, as if she was urging him to join her.

Richard finally grasped her intent. Without hesitation, he strode into the elevator.

The lift descended several floors and stopped.

As soon as the doors opened, Richard bolted out, not waiting for any further instructions from Kaja.

###chapter 282 Turn Around Immediately

When she watched Richard's frantic figure disappear down the hallway, Kaja's eyes glinted with sadness before she followed, her steps heavy.

With Kaja's guidance, Richard quickly found the room. As he burst through the door, he saw two men looming over Nina, ready to strike.

Richard's fury was immediate. He threw himself at the attackers, delivering powerful kicks that had them crying out in pain and rolling on the floor, utterly defeated. It wasn't until they were barely conscious that Kaja managed to restrain him.

Â In his rage, Richard's eyes were wild, his fists clenched tightly, his entire body tensed like steel. He was a formidable sight, a storm of anger and muscle. When Kaja grabbed his arm, he instinctively grabbed her wrist in return, causing a loud crack as her bones dislocated, sending her into a shivering, almost collapsing heap.

Richard froze, his rage slowly fading as he realized what he'd done. He released Kaja's wrist, and she stumbled back, pointing urgently at the bed where Nina lay.

Ignoring everything else, Richard swiftly wrapped Nina in a blanket and carried her away.

Isabella and Michael arrived just as Richard emerged, cradling Nina in his arms.

Both were startled by the scene, especially Isabella, whose face drained of color. "What happened to Nina?"

Richard continued towards the exit, barely pausing to respond. "She's fine. I'm taking her home. Michael, take Isabella back. Don't follow us."

"But I..."Â Isabella started to protest, but Michael stopped her.

"Trust Richard. No one matters more to him than Nina does."

Michael's words carried weight. Isabella, seeing Richard's evident concern for Nina, realized pressing further would be inappropriate. She agreed to go home with Michael.

When they reached her place, Isabella found Sebastian already there. With Charles' birthday party the next day, Sebastian was visibly tense.

The two spent the afternoon at home, avoiding any work and enjoying the breeze on the balcony. They chatted and drank coffee for hours. Isabella recounted everything about Nathaniel, her meeting with Quentin, her hospital visit to Matthew, and Emma's promises in meticulous detail.

Sebastian listened quietly, holding her hand and remaining silent for a long while.

"Sebastian?"Â Isabella looked over and realized he had fallen asleep without her noticing.

The afternoon sun bathed the room in warmth, accompanied by the gentle breeze, which certainly made it easy to drift off. Before long, Isabella was asleep too.

As Sebastian lay beside her, he suddenly awoke. He carefully got up, draped a light blanket over Isabella, and, admiring her peaceful face, lifted her from the chair and carried her to the bedroom.

When Isabella woke up, the room was dark, and Sebastian was nowhere to be seen. The bed was empty except for her.

"Sebastian?"Â she called, but her voice echoed in the quiet room.

Slipping out of bed and into her slippers, Isabella headed downstairs. The aroma of cooking filled the air.

Surprised, she hurried down the stairs just in time to see Sebastian emerging from the kitchen with a tray of food. His gaze softened as he saw her. "You're awake?"

"Hmm."Â Isabella nodded, letting out a silent sigh of relief.

She had been worried that Sebastian had gone off to work again.

Being left behind felt terrible, and Isabella's insecurity had only worsened since losing Sweetie. Though she understood Sebastian's demanding job, she couldn't help but wish he would spend more time with her.

"Wash your hands before we eat,"Â Sebastian instructed.

"Sure,"Â Isabella replied.

By the time Isabella finished washing up and entered the dining room, Sebastian had already taken off his apron and was pouring freshly squeezed juice into glasses.

His movements were smooth and practiced, reminding her of when he had cooked for her using the clay stove in Northhaven.

The click of a camera shutter interrupted the moment, making Sebastian glance over.

Caught in the act of taking a candid photo, Isabella felt a pang of guilt. As Sebastian turned, she quickly lowered her phone, feigning nonchalance. "I was just taking pictures of the food,"Â she said, trying to cover her tracks.

Sebastian placed the juice by her side, pulled out a chair, and sat down next to her. "Let me see?"

Under Sebastian's gaze, Isabella couldn't hold out for more than three seconds and reluctantly retrieved her phone. She opened the photo gallery. "It's a picture of you."

Sebastian leaned in to take a look. "Hmm, not bad."

Before Isabella could react, Sebastian had taken her phone and started adjusting the camera. He aimed the front-facing lens at both of them and snapped a selfie.

"Go ahead and take pictures if you want,"Â Sebastian said as he handed the phone back. He leaned down and kissed her gently on the forehead. "I've sent someone to Emerald Isle City. Once we find Sweetie, we'll get a family photo."

Mentioning Sweetie softened Isabella's heart. She nodded quietly. "Okay."

The next day, Sebastian took Isabella to the Landon family estate for Charles' birthday party.

Halfway through the drive, Sebastian suddenly received a phone call.

With Isabella sitting right next to him, Sebastian put the call on speaker, and every word from the other end came through clearly.

"Mr. Landon, we've found a lead on your daughter."

Before Sebastian could respond, Isabella snatched the phone, holding it with both hands. "Where is she? My daughter, where is she? Is she okay? Is she hurt?"

Despite her effort to stay composed, her voice trembled, and tears streamed down her face.

On the other end, the voice replied, "We haven't seen the child ourselves yet. We only saw surveillance footage. The child's adoptive parents have acknowledged that the child is theirs, but they won't let us see her. The police said they have valid adoption papers, so it would be best if the biological parents came in for a paternity test. Otherwise, their investigation might hit a snag."

"I'm going, I'll go right now!"Â Isabella said without a second thought.

Nothing could be more important than Sweetie!

Sebastian quickly gave a few more instructions before ending the call.

He wrapped Isabella in his arms, holding her tightly. "Bella, you're shaking."

"Yeah,"Â Isabella replied, her body still trembling uncontrollably. She gripped Sebastian's hand tightly, tears streaming down her face. "Sebastian, they found Sweetie. Our daughter, they found her. I need to go to Emerald Isle City, and I need to go there right away. I have to see her!"

"Okay. Okay!"Â Sebastian said, each reassurance measured and calm.

He turned to the driver and ordered, "Turn around immediately, head to the airport."

###chapter 283 Aren't You Coming with Me?

The car sped all the way to the airport."We're here, Mr. Landon,"Â the driver announced, opening the door and standing outside.

Isabella turned and saw the airport entrance, feeling as if she were in a dream. She clutched Sebastian's hand and said, "But I didn't bring my ID!"

The call had come unexpectedly while they were en route to the Landon family residence. Normally, they would have gone back to retrieve the documents first before heading to the airport.

Sebastian reassured her, "I've already sent someone to get them. The tickets are booked on my phone. Everything is taken care of. Just focus on getting there."

With that, Isabella felt a bit more at ease. She nodded, "Alright."

Still in a daze, Isabella followed Sebastian into the airport and into the departure lounge.

It wasn't long before Laura hurried in with a suitcase. "Mr. Landon, Isabella."

She handed over the ID and the freshly printed tickets.

Sebastian checked everything and handed the items to Isabella. "Here's twenty thousand dollars in cash. I've transferred eighty thousand to your account. If you need more, just let me know, and I'll send more."

Isabella looked at him, suddenly realizing, "Sebastian, aren't you coming with me?"

The warm lighting in the departure lounge made Sebastian's touch on her cheek feel especially comforting, giving Isabella an overwhelming sense of belonging. She couldn't help but lean into his palm.

Sebastian's gaze was gentle. "Everything is set up. Bella, I can't back out now. I need to settle things with Charles."Isabella's heart wavered. She grasped Sebastian's hand tightly. "I'll stay here with you!"

Sebastian smiled softly. "And Sweetie?"

Isabella hesitated.

Yes, it was a difficult choice between her longed-for Sweetie and Sebastian. Balancing these two priorities was agonizing.

Before Isabella could come up with an answer, Sebastian spoke again, "At most, it will be a day. You go ahead, and once I'm done here-win or lose-I'll fly over to you immediately. You and Sweetie just need to wait one more day. Okay?"

Sebastian's voice was warm and reassuring, his calm words easing Isabella's anxious heart.

Ultimately, Isabella decided to go to Emerald Isle City to find Sweetie.

She thought, 'Sebastian won't be alone in Lakina; he has the Jose family and Richard's help, so he will be fine.'

Just then, Jack walked over. "Mr. Landon, it's about time."

"Right."Â Sebastian nodded, sharing a final look with Isabella before rising to leave.

Isabella suddenly panicked, standing up and grabbing his hand urgently.

Sebastian stopped, and as he turned, Isabella threw her arms around him.

Standing on tiptoe, she buried her face in his shoulder. "Sebastian, Sweetie and I will be waiting for you in Emerald Isle City."

"Okay,"Â Sebastian replied, pulling her into a tight embrace.

At that moment, Isabella truly didn't want to let go. Since she and Sebastian had been together, their lives had been a whirlwind. Though there were times she felt incredibly insecure, as long as she was with him, she feared nothing.

Parting was always bittersweet. Even though she was looking forward to seeing Sweetie soon, Isabella couldn't shake the underlying sadness.

With ten minutes left before boarding, Isabella sat in the vast lounge, watching plane after plane take off and disappear into the sky. Her heart felt as if it were suspended in mid-air, unsettled and uneasy.

She thought, 'Is Sweetie really in Emerald Isle City? Why today, of all days? Everything felt so surreal, as if I'm trapped in a dream.'

Her mind was flooded with doubts and uncertainties, and the more she thought, the more her anxiety grew.

"Isabella, Isabella?"Â Laura's voice broke through her thoughts.

Isabella snapped back to reality.

Laura was already standing. "Time to board. Shall we?"

"Yeah,"Â Isabella responded and stood up, following Laura toward the gate.

The VIP lane meant no waiting, but as they approached it, Isabella's heart raced with a sudden, irrational fear that the gate might somehow devour her whole, leaving nothing behind.

"Isabella?"Â Laura, having already passed through, looked back at Isabella, who seemed lost in thought and a bit pale. She came back and asked, "Is everything alright?"

Isabella shook her head.

"Let's get our tickets checked,"Â Laura said gently.

After a moment's hesitation, Isabella stepped forward and handed her ID and ticket to the attendant.

The Landon family event was unfolding smoothly. Sebastian arrived just in time, the last guest to arrive.

As everyone was toasting Charles' birthday, Sebastian emerged from the crowd. People parted to make way for him as he walked across the soft grass, making his way to the front.

There was a brief, tense silence. All eyes were on him, shifting between Charles and Sebastian.

Recently, Sebastian and Charles had stirred up quite a storm in Lakina. Although they maintained a facade of a harmonious father-son relationship publicly, everyone knew that privately, their relationship had soured long ago, and they were bitter enemies.

In a setting like today's, Sebastian's arrival was a wild card-whether it was a blessing or a curse remained uncertain.

Charles, holding a glass of wine, approached Sebastian. His reaction to Sebastian's arrival was calm and composed. At least outwardly, he appeared both pleased and somewhat relieved.

With the warmth of a loving father, Charles patted Sebastian's shoulder and said, "Sebastian, I knew you'd come."

Sebastian regarded him with a neutral expression. "On a day as important as this, of course, I had to be here."

"Just glad you made it,"Â Charles said, his eyes misty, putting on a show of deep emotion.

Sebastian remained impassive. To others, he appeared as the rebellious, ungrateful son who took his parents'Â love for granted.

Sebastian didn't let this bother him. "I've brought a small gift for you. I hope you'll like it."

As he spoke, Sebastian gave a subtle nod, and from behind the crowd emerged a graceful figure.

All eyes turned toward Siena. Charles' brow furrowed slightly, though he maintained his composure. Emma, standing nearby, watched the scene with a smile that gradually faltered, her hands clenched tightly by her sides.

Siena, a young woman with a sweet, innocent beauty, wore a white dress that shimmered in the sunlight, giving her an almost ethereal quality, as though she had stepped out of a painting. Her presence felt surreal.

Emma's gaze fixed on Siena's face, which bore a striking resemblance to Anna's, and she felt a surge of frustration, as if she could crush her teeth in anger.

###chapter 284 Seeing Too Much Filth

Siena walked gracefully and stopped beside Sebastian, but her gaze was firmly fixed on Charles.

Charles merely glanced at her, pretending not to recognize her, and deliberately asked Sebastian, "I thought on an occasion like today, you would bring Isabella. After all, she is your fiancÃ©e."

His words caused a brief stir among the crowd, who began speculating about the relationship between Siena and Sebastian.

Sebastian remained silent.

Siena took a step forward and reached out to take Charles' arm.

Charles, however, quickly stepped back and looked at Siena with full alertness. "What are you doing?"

Siena bit her lip, her eyes reddening with grievance. She softly said, "Mr. Landon, don't you recognize me?"

Charles scrutinized the girl in front of him. When his gaze passed over her face, which resembled Anna's, a trace of disgust flashed in his eyes. He didn't answer Siena but looked at Sebastian, his tone and expression becoming more serious. "Sebastian, what is the meaning of this?"

Sebastian smirked and said, "It's quite a coincidence. Yesterday, when I went to the hospital, I happened to meet this young lady. She was undergoing a prenatal checkup and was crying in front of the payment machine because she couldn't afford the fees. I couldn't stand it and helped her out. Later, I found out that she is pregnant with your child. I thought today, being your birthday, you would be delighted to know you have a child on the way, so I brought her to meet you."

"What nonsense are you talking about?" Charles didn't believe that and remained calm despite the astonished looks from the crowd. "I don't know this woman at all!"

"Really?" Sebastian chuckled lightly, neither confirming nor denying.

"Mr. Landon," Siena said in a trembling voice, already on the verge of tears. She placed one hand protectively over her belly and looked at Charles with tearful eyes. "This child is really yours. You're the only man I've been with."

Before she could finish, Charles' sharp gaze swept over her.

Siena stopped speaking, her tears still brimming. She bit her lip and said, "I came today just to seek your opinion. If you want this child, no matter how hard it is, I will give birth to him. If you don't want him..."

"Ridiculous!" Charles interrupted coldly. "I don't know you at all. How could I possibly have a child with you?"

With that, he called for the servants to escort Siena out.

Siena, with tears streaming down, looked pitiful but said nothing more as she was taken away.

The situation became manageable again. Charles stepped forward, gazing intently into Sebastian's eyes. Through gritted teeth, in a voice only the two of them could hear, he said, "I will get to the bottom of this. If it's false, you know what the consequences will be!"

Sebastian smiled lightly, unfazed by the threat.

The party continued as if nothing had happened.

Zaire walked over with a glass of wine, glanced around, and whispered, "Richard and I have our people in place. When do you plan to act?"

Sebastian glanced at him and downed his drink. "I don't need your help."

This was a personal grudge between him and Charles, and he wanted to handle it himself.

Zaire nodded in understanding and asked, "Where's Isabella? Why isn't she here?"

A touch of tenderness appeared in Sebastian's eyes. "She went to Emerald Isle City."

"Emerald Isle City?" Zaire pondered for a moment and then understood. "You deliberately sent her away?"

Sebastian said, "Yes."

"With Isabella's temperament, if she knew you sent her away on purpose, she would be upset." After a pause, Zaire added, "But it's better for her to stay out of this. Charles knows she's your vulnerability. If she were here, it would be harder for you to act."

Sebastian was silent for a few seconds and then said, "I'd rather she be upset with me later than bring her into danger. My cabilities are limited; I can only protect her this much."

As they were talking, an assistant approached Sebastian, leaning in to whisper, "Mr. Landon, as instructed, I've been waiting by the back door for Ms. Scott. She hasn't come out yet. I just checked the area again, but I still haven't found her."

Sebastian gave a faint smile.

Zaire, having overheard, glanced at Sebastian's assistant and then asked, "What about Jack? Isn't he usually the one who handles these things? I haven't seen him around today."

Sebastian replied, "I've sent him to protect Isabella."

Jack was Sebastian's trusted right-hand man-calm and reliable; the one Sebastian felt most secure with. On the surface, Sebastian had arranged for Laura and Isabella to travel together, but in reality, Jack, in disguise, was meant to follow them closely.

Sebastian checked his watch and noted the time. "The plane should be landing soon."

What Sebastian hadn't anticipated was that Jack would be compromised before boarding. Isabella didn't get on the plane; instead, she'd doubled back and blended into the Landon family's surroundings.

She was fully aware that she was Sebastian's vulnerability. If she appeared openly, it would only put Sebastian at greater risk. Sebastian wanted to protect her, and she felt the same way.

The moment Isabella saw Jack at the airport, she understood everything. Sebastian wouldn't put her in harm's way, and she wasn't about to let him face danger alone.

For now, Isabella had to stay hidden and wait for the right moment to act. If everything went smoothly, she'd leave the same way she came. But if things went awry, she hoped to face whatever happened alongside Sebastian.

Avoiding the crowded front entrance to avoid exposure, Isabella made her way to the back. However, the back door was also being monitored. She crouched next to a car, trying to figure out how to get in when suddenly, the vehicle shook violently.

Isabella froze, then heard the sound of a woman's heavy breathing coming from inside the car. Realizing what was happening, she blushed with embarrassment. Just as she was about to turn away, the car window rolled down.

Turning her head, Isabella was greeted by a provocative scene: a woman was moving on top of Leo, who was reclining in the seat with a look of intense pleasure, his hands gripping her waist. The window had apparently been rolled down accidentally by the woman. Lost in the moment, she didn't notice Isabella standing outside. But Leo did. Their eyes locked for a brief, stunned second.

In the blink of an eye, Leo's expression shifted to shock. He quickly rolled the window back up, obscuring the scene inside.

Isabella, slightly dazed, averted her gaze and rubbed her eyes. She thought to herself, 'Seeing such dirty stuff makes me worried about my vision.'

###chapter 285 He Is Different from You

After the car window was closed, the noise inside the car significantly decreased, and even the car body stopped shaking.

Isabella thought that her presence here was becoming too much of a distraction to others. She decided to move to a different spot. Just as she took a step, the car door opened, and Leo stepped out, a faint blush still lingering on his face.

He glanced at Isabella somewhat awkwardly, then looked away and said, "What are you doing here?"

Isabella couldn't really explain, but she thought maybe Leo could help her, so she said, "I want to go inside. Can you help me?"

Leo glanced at her again, seemingly puzzled. "Sebastian refused to bring you here?""

"I don't want to explain," Isabella said, "Just tell me if you'll help or not."

"No," Leo crossed his arms. "Unless you give me a kiss, then I'll consider it."

Isabella was speechless and glanced at the tightly closed car window behind him. "Didn't you just finish making out?"

Leo was speechless.

Isabella continued, "Why is it that every time I run into you, you're doing this kind of thing? You must be really desperate."

Leo shrugged helplessly. "What can I do? I'm a man with normal needs, but you won't let me touch you. Otherwise, I would have quit long ago."

"How is that my problem?" Isabella kept her distance. "This is clearly your own issue. I have nothing to do with you, so don't drag me into it."

Leo said, "I'm serious. Isabella, if you just nod, I can make a change."

Isabella looked at him expressionlessly. "Sorry, I'm not a saint. I don't have a habit of saving people."

She thought Leo was a complete mess.

"Why are you willing to save Sebastian then?" Leo's words sounded bitter even to himself.

Isabella glared at him. "He's not a spoiled brat."

After a pause, she added seriously, "He's different from you!"

Leo sneered, "That's because you don't know him well enough. He might be worse than me."

"I don't want to hear this," Isabella interrupted him, "We've been through so much lately. Sebastian is my fiancÃ©, and I trust him. I won't listen to others' slander, so take back what you want to say. Because I won't believe a word of it."

Leo smiled and said nothing more.

Seeing that Leo didn't seem willing to help her, Isabella decided to find another way. "Then you carry on. I'm leaving."

"Wait," Leo called out to her.

Isabella turned back. "What?"

"Today, outside the Landon family's estate, there are several groups of people guarding it. You won't be able to get in."

Isabella said, "I'll find a way."

Leo's gaze swept over her from head to toe. "Even if you manage to blend in, dressed like this, you'll be recognized immediately."

Isabella looked down at herself. Indeed, she had come straight from the airport and was still wearing a dress. Going in like this would be too conspicuous, with nowhere to hide.

"Come with me," Leo said, turning to leave.

Isabella hesitated for a few seconds, feeling like she was out of options, before quickly stepping inside after Leo.

As Charles' godson, Leo was a familiar face around the Landon family estate. Entering through the back door was a breeze for him, and it was just as easy to bring Isabella along.

They made their way through the back entrance, and Leo led her to a room in the servants' quarters. He pushed open a storage closet and said, "Wait here while I grab something."

With that, he shut the door behind him and left. The click of the lock startled Isabella. She hurried over to the door, tugging at it, only to find it secured from the outside.

Her heart sank. "Leo, you tricked me again!"

Almost as soon as she finished speaking, the door swung open again. Leo stood there, holding a set of clothes and wearing a smirk. "I help you out and you're still cursing me?"

Caught off guard, Isabella felt a pang of shame. "I didn't..."

Leo raised an eyebrow and cut her off, "What, did you really think I was locking you in?"

Though she felt embarrassed, she had indeed feared that was what was happening. But it turned out she was wrong. Despite his flaws, Leo wasn't irredeemably bad. Occasionally, a glimmer of decency showed through.

"Sorry,"Â Isabella said.

Leo chuckled. "No need to apologize. Honestly, I'd love to lock you in. That way, you wouldn't be able to escape."

The fleeting gratitude Isabella had felt vanished like a puff of smoke. She glared at Leo.

"Change into these,"Â Leo said with a grin, handing her the clothes. "I'll wait outside. And remember to lock the door. I might come barging in on a whim, and you wouldn't want me seeing something you'd rather keep hidden."

Isabella decided she had misjudged Leo. Clearly, he was not the good Samaritan she hoped for. With a wary eye on him, she locked the door tightly and quickly changed behind it.

The uniform was clearly from the Landon family's staff, and though Isabella wasn't sure where Leo had procured it, it fit her quite well.

When she emerged dressed in the uniform, Leo was standing under a tree outside, smoking a cigarette. Hearing her, he flicked the cigarette butt away and waved his hand to clear the smoke before approaching her. He looked her over with a touch of pride. "I knew you'd need a size S."

Isabella, annoyed by his irreverence, decided not to engage. "Thanks. I'll be going now."

She turned to leave, but Leo grabbed her wrist. Pulling out a black mask from his pocket, he carefully placed it over her face. "It's crowded today. I'm going to steal Charles' evidence for you. After the party, wait for me here. If all goes well, I'll be here by ten at the latest."

Isabella, surprised and a bit excited, looked up at him. "You're serious? You're actually going to help me steal the evidence?"

Leo met her gaze. "I owe you a favor. I may not be a saint, but I keep my promises. Especially to you. Even if it costs me my life, I'll do it."

Isabella thought his words sounded overly dramatic for what he was doing. "It's just stealing something, it's not life or death. But you'd better not get caught by Charles, or he might really kill you."

Leo smiled, a mix of amusement and something more in his eyes. "Isabella, if I die one day, will you shed a tear for me?"

###chapter 286 Won't Shed Tears

Isabella didn't want to answer, but Leo tightened his grip on her arm and asked again, "Will you?"

To make him give up, Isabella said, "No."

The smile on Leo's face faded a bit, but he still didn't give up. "Really? Not even a single tear?"

"No!" Isabella said firmly, then added, "Don't worry. Someone as bad as you won't die so easily."

Leo was taken aback, then chuckled. "You're right."

His grip loosened, and Isabella pulled her hand away. Music started playing from the front yard, signaling the beginning of the party. Isabella hurriedly said, "I have to go."

This time, Leo didn't stop her.

Isabella took a few steps forward and vaguely heard him call her name.

Hesitating for a moment, she paused in her steps. "What's the matter?"

"Nothing." Leo smiled.

As the sun set, the courtyard was bathed in golden light. Leo stood under a tree, seemingly out of place with the brilliant sunset.

For a moment, Isabella felt sorry for Leo. But it was just a moment, and she quickly found herself ridiculous.

Shaking her head, Isabella turned to walk away without looking back.

Leo stood there, watching her figure fade into the distance, and muttered in a low voice, "Isabella, you're right. Someone like me, even if I die, no one would shed a tear for me."

It wasn't until Isabella's figure completely disappeared that Leo looked away, a wry smile appearing on his face.

A breeze blew by, and Leo took out his phone from his pocket. Glancing at the caller ID, he pressed the answer button. A deep male voice came from the other end. "Mr. Anderson, your test results are out. It's late-stage cancer."

The person on the other end rambled on, but Leo just listened quietly, his expression unchanged. Finally, he asked calmly, "How much longer do I have to live?"

After a brief silence, the other end said, "At most six months. But if you agree to aggressive treatment..."

Leo chuckled lightly and said nonchalantly, "No treatment."

The number of people attending the party was even more than Isabella had imagined.

She searched the crowd for a while but couldn't find Sebastian, not even Zaire. Instead, she saw Emily.

Emily was standing among a group of men. At first, Isabella didn't recognize her. Since the last time she saw Emily at Springfield Hot Springs, Emily had disappeared.

Sebastian had mentioned that Emily was taken away by Kevin.

It had been a long time since they last met. Emily had lost a lot of weight, and even the smallest dress size was almost too big for her. Yet, she still held a wine glass, laughing and chatting among the men.

Isabella saw a man touch Emily's butt, another one deliberately brushing against her. The men surrounding her all had lecherous looks, taking advantage of her.

Emily giggled, her playful resistance making the men even more eager.

The men were uttering revolting remarks. Emily had been displaying an expression of sheer enjoyment, but the moment her eyes unintentionally met Isabella's, she froze as if electrocuted.

Isabella, fearing Emily might recognize her, lowered her head, pretending to tidy up the cakes and the table.

"Miss Lopez? What's wrong with you?"

Emily snapped back to reality and shook her head. "Nothing."

For a moment, she thought she saw Isabella.

But upon closer inspection, it was just a servant from the Landon family.

She thought, 'Thank goodness it isn't Isabella.'

Emily breathed a sigh of relief.

She thought, 'I can afford to lose my dignity, but not in front of Isabella.

'Especially not to Isabella!

'I've lost to Isabella, and lost so badly. Do I now have to let Isabella see me like this, a laughing stock? No way!'

"Miss Lopez, I'm very interested in the cooperation you mentioned earlier. It's quite crowded here, why don't we go somewhere quiet and secluded to discuss it further?"

"Speak of the devil, I'm also quite interested in Miss Lopez's cooperation."

"Miss Lopez, you can't just consider him and leave us out. If we're going to talk, we should all talk together. It's more lively with more people, isn't it?"

The men let out lewd laughter.

Emily felt uneasy. She set down her glass and was about to make an excuse to leave.

But then, Kevin walked over with a glass in his hand and chimed in, "If you gentlemen are serious, I've already arranged for a hotel nearby. If you don't mind, you can go there to talk. The environment is elegant and quiet, I'm sure you'll be satisfied."

The men were, of course, pleased with his thoughtful arrangement and happily made their way there.

Emily frowned, "Does it have to be today? I'm not feeling well and I don't want to go."

Kevin's face suddenly turned cold. "Emily, don't play the damsel in distress with me. Your task today is to keep these gentlemen company and secure their investments. If you fail to do so, just wait and see how I'll deal with you when we get back!"

Emily felt indignant, "Kevin, is that even human? You know I'm not feeling well today, yet you still want me to do that. And with multiple people at once, what do you take me for?"

"What am I taking you for?" Kevin sneered, his eyes full of sarcasm. "Aren't you just a whore?"

"You!"

"What you? Don't forget, you begged me for this. Emily, you said as long as I let you out, you'd do anything for me. So, what's the problem with this little request now? Don't forget how you begged me!"

Remembering the dark, windowless dungeon, Emily felt a chill run through her body. She never wanted to be locked up again, and the only way to avoid that was to obey Kevin.

But the thought of those pot-bellied men made her feel physically sick.

Emily reached out and grabbed Kevin's sleeve, pleading softly, "Kevin, please just let me do this one at a time. I'm really not feeling well today. Can't I just keep one company today and the other tomorrow when I'm better?"

Kevin roughly shoved her away, sending her stumbling and nearly knocking over a nearby cake.

"Emily, who do you think you are, picking and choosing? I'm telling you, if you don't secure these deals today, you're not coming out!"

Emily's face paled, and she gritted her teeth, "Fine, I'll go!"

With that, she teetered away on her high heels to catch up with the men.

After Emily had left, Kevin spat on the ground and cursed, "Bitch!"

As Kevin turned to grab his glass, a cake suddenly flew by and splattered onto his suit, leaving a mess in its wake.

###chapter 287 This Is Crazy

"Who!" Kevin looked at his soiled suit, fuming with anger.

Before he could find the culprit, a servant ran over, saying, "I'm sorry, sir, let me clean it for you." Then she started wiping his suit with a cloth.

At first, Kevin didn't react, but by the time he did, his suit was completely ruined.

Originally, only a small piece of cake had hit the suit, and it could have been cleaned and reused. But after the maid's enthusiastic wiping, cream and jam were smeared all over.

A crowd had gathered around, pointing at Kevin, rolling their eyes, and laughing at him.

Kevin was furious. He grabbed the maid's hand and shouted, "What are you doing?"

The maid seemed scared, bowing and apologizing frantically without even daring to look up.

"Do you know how much this suit costs? Can you afford to pay for it?" Kevin's eyes were filled with rage.

This suit was actually rented and had to be returned. The Anderson family was now under Leo's control, and Leo was just a puppet of Charles.

Once living a life of luxury, Kevin could no longer afford a custom suit and had to rent one. But now that it was ruined, he would have to buy it.

The problem was that he didn't have the money to pay for it.

Kevin gritted his teeth, wishing he could tear the maid apart.

Under such circumstances, the maid attempted to escape several times, but Kevin saw through her efforts each time. He firmly gripped Isabella's wrist, snarling fiercely, "This suit costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. If you don't pay today, don't even think about leaving!"

Isabella was speechless. She just wanted to teach Kevin a small lesson for forcing Emily, thinking he was utterly shameless. She didn't expect to be extorted.

She thought, 'Now I can't escape, and if this continues, it will definitely escalate. Can I still keep up my disguise then?'

Just as Isabella didn't know what to do, a voice suddenly intervened.

"Mr. Anderson, it's just a suit. Why get so worked up?"

Isabella found the voice familiar and looked up to see a tall figure emerging from the crowd.

She thought, 'Quentin? He is also invited to the Landon family event?'

Kevin clearly didn't recognize Quentin, but when he saw Quentin's distinguished appearance and expensive attire, especially the triangular brooch on his suit pocket, Kevin's eyes lit up. "Is that the famous designer Ms. Stewart's work, the Trillium Brooch?"

Quentin smiled slightly. "Mr. Anderson, you have a keen eye."

"Who are you? I've never seen you before," Kevin questioned Quentin's identity despite recognizing the brooch.

Before Quentin could speak, several businessmen surrounded him. "Mr. Black, we've heard you were coming today. We apologize for not welcoming you properly."

"We didn't expect Mr. Black to be so young and handsome. Truly impressive, we are humbled."

"Mr. Black?" Kevin finally realized. "Are you the legendary Mr. Black?"

Quentin nodded, very approachable. "That's me."

Kevin immediately let go, nervously rubbing his hands. "Mr. Black, I'm sorry; I didn't recognize you. I'm Kevin, the eldest son of the Anderson family. It's an honor to meet you."

Isabella took the opportunity to slip away.

By the time Kevin realized it, the maid was gone, and he had to swallow the loss.

Upstairs in the study, Emma unlocked the door and saw Siena lying on the sofa.

Charles was seated beside her, and as Emma opened the door, he leaned over and kissed Siena gently on the cheek.

When he saw Â Emma, Charles' expression soured instantly. "There are plenty of guests downstairs. What are you doing up here?"

Siena lay with her eyes closed, breathing evenly, as if asleep.

Emma glanced at her and asked as she entered, "You can't seriously believe Sebastian's story, that this woman is actually pregnant, can you?"

Charles replied, "I wouldn't take his word for it alone. The doctor's on the way. Once she's examined, we'll know if she's really pregnant."

Emma shook her head in disbelief. "Even if she is pregnant, are you really considering keeping the baby?"

"Why wouldn't I?"

Emma was taken aback by the question, her heart sinking. "Charles, you already have a son! If you let this woman have the baby, what happens to Matthew?"

"Matthew is still my son. That doesn't change. If Siena has a child, it will just mean I have another child. Don't worry, you will still be Mrs. Landon, and Matthew will still be the eldest. Their existence won't affect your status. What's rightfully yours won't be reduced by a single penny."

Emma shook her head, exasperated. "You're out of your mind!"

Charles' gaze remained fixed on Siena's face as he gently stroked her cheek. "Emma, look at her. She resembles Anna so much, especially her eyes and nose. Don't you think she could be Anna reincarnated?"

Emma was at a loss for words.

At that moment, Emma's phone rang.

She glanced at the caller ID, steadied herself, and answered, "Hello."

The voice on the other end delivered shocking news. Emma's face went pale. "What did you say? Matthew's missing?!

"Yes, yes, we'll cooperate. As soon as he's back, I'll persuade him to turn himself in."

She ended the call and turned to Charles. "Charles, the hospital just called. Matthew's escaped."

Charles frowned. "Escaped?"

"Yes. Today was supposed to be his return to prison day. Everything was fine until after he left the hospital. Suddenly, he jumped into a car, drove off, and vanished."Â Emma was nearly in tears, panic evident in her voice. "Charles, what do we do now? Matthew's considered a fugitive! Isn't this going to add to his sentence? Why would he run now, just when he's so close to being free? Where could he have gone?"

Emma was on the brink of tears, while Charles remained remarkably composed.

At that moment, Siena stirred in her sleep, a faint groan escaping her lips as her face contorted in pain.

Charles immediately turned his attention to her, leaning in and whispering softly, "What's wrong?"

Siena, still with her eyes shut, murmured, "It hurts."

###chapter 288 Poison Juice

"Siena, where does it hurt?" Charles asked nervously.

But Siena fell asleep again and didn't answer his question.

Charles's gaze shifted downward and saw one of her hands covering her stomach. His expression grew tense again. "Is it a stomachache? Could it be an overdose of medication?"

As he spoke, Charles reached out to rub Siena's stomach. His movements were cautious, and his eyes were filled with obsession.

He had completely ignored Emma, who was still beside him, heartbroken over Matthew.

In the end, Emma was at a loss for words, turned her head in disappointment, and left angrily.

Isabella had been looking for Sebastian, first outside and then inside the Landon family house.

Thanks to the outfit Leo found for her, she could move freely inside and outside without arousing suspicion.

After searching the first floor, Isabella carried a tray and headed upstairs.

As soon as she stepped onto the second floor, she ran into Emma. Afraid that Emma would recognize her, Isabella immediately turned around, trying to avoid her.

But Emma called out to her, "Stop right there!"

Isabella, afraid of arousing suspicion, had to stop and turn back, but she kept her head down and said in a muffled voice, "Mrs. Landon."

Emma looked her up and down and asked, "Who told you to bring up the drinks?"

Isabella lied, "Mr. Landon."

Emma glanced at the two beautifully colored juices on the tray and frowned deeply. "At a time like this, he's still thinking about romance!"

Then she asked, "Where's the doctor? When will they arrive?"

Isabella wasn't sure what Emma was talking about, but she couldn't let on. She decided to play along, "It seems like"

Before she could finish, the sound of footsteps interrupted her.

Charles' personal doctors arrived-two young men, each carrying a medical bag.

They paused briefly in front of Emma, nodding politely. "Mrs. Landon."

Emma wore a bitter smile. "Well, you've arrived quickly!"

It was clear to anyone that Emma was not pleased.

The two doctors exchanged uncertain glances, unsure of how to respond.

After a few tense seconds, Emma stepped aside and said, "They're in the study. Go ahead."

"Thank you, Mrs. Landon,"Â the doctors murmured, quickly making their way to the study.

Isabella had hoped to slip away unnoticed, but Emma called her back. "Come with me."

Isabella had no choice but to follow.

Instead of going downstairs, Emma led her to the master bedroom.

"Close the door,"Â Emma instructed.

Isabella did as she was told.

When she turned back, Emma was holding a small glass vial. She walked over and handed it to Isabella. "Pour this into those two glasses of juice."

Isabella stared in confusion.

Emma's intent seemed clear: she wanted to poison Charles' drink.

Emma's face still bore traces of a recent altercation, partially concealed by makeup. Though not obvious, it was there.

Isabella thought, 'Is Emma driven to this extreme by Charles' abuse, planning to poison him at his own birthday party?'

"Just take it!"Â Emma snapped, seeing Isabella's hesitation. She shoved the vial into Isabella's hand. "I'll be right here, watching you pour it in!"

Isabella stood frozen, not knowing what to do.

Emma, clearly losing patience, stepped forward, grabbed Isabella's hand, and forced her to pour the contents of the vial into the two glasses of juice. The colorless, odorless liquid mixed seamlessly into the juice, disappearing without a trace.

Emma then pulled out two white pills, crushed them, and added the powder to the glasses. She waited until the white residue was completely dissolved, then allowed a satisfied smile to creep onto her face. "Go ahead, take them over."

"Yes, Mrs. Landon,"Â Isabella replied, picking up the tray and heading towards the door.

Isabella had planned to switch out the poisoned juice once she was out of the room. However, Emma stayed right by her side, following her all the way to the study and knocking on the door.

Isabella tightened her grip on the tray, forced to improvise on the spot.

The door opened, and before Isabella could react, Emma pushed her forward with a firm shove, sending her into the room.

Inside, Isabella saw Siena sprawled on the sofa. The doctors had already drawn her blood and were running tests nearby. Charles stood impatiently, waiting for news.

The heavy floor-to-ceiling curtains blocked out all external light, creating a stark contrast between the lively chaos downstairs and the somber, tense atmosphere of the room.

Charles turned and scowled upon seeing Isabella. "What are you doing here? Get out!"

Isabella hesitated for a moment before turning to leave.

She had originally come looking for Sebastian and had ended up here by accident due to Emma's push. Since Charles was sending her away, it was a perfect opportunity for her to leave without suspicion.

Just as she turned, Charles called out, "Wait!"

Isabella froze.

"Put the juice down."

Isabella remained still.

Charles' irritation grew. "I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?"

Isabella heard him loud and clear, but only she knew that those were poisoned drinks. She wanted nothing more than to ruin Charles' day, but she didn't want blood on her hands. If Charles and Siena ended up dead, she would be implicated.

But if she didn't follow through, it would definitely raise suspicion and expose her.

While Isabella was caught in this dilemma, the doctors suddenly spoke up. "We have results."

Charles's attention snapped to them. "So, is she pregnant?"

"Yes, she's pregnant. According to our assessment, she's been pregnant for at least two weeks."

"Two weeks,"Â Charles said, calculating. "Yes, that's right. Exactly two weeks."

It was exactly two weeks since he'd slept with Siena.

The child was his!

Charles' laughter filled the room, echoing off the walls.

As Charles and the doctors continued their conversation, Isabella took the opportunity to leave the study. But to her surprise, Emma was still outside, waiting.

The door closed slowly behind Isabella, and as she came face to face with Emma, the laughter from inside the room carried through. Emma's eyes flashed with a dangerous glint as she fixed her cold stare on Isabella. "Who told you to come out? Why didn't you set the juice down?"

Isabella lowered her gaze. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Landon."

Emma sneered, her voice dripping with contempt. "Afraid, are you? Afraid of getting blood on your hands?"

Isabella nodded slightly.

Emma's lip curled in disdain. "You're scared of the consequences, but you didn't think about the price of defying me? Since you're so concerned about Charles and that woman's lives and now know about my plan, I can't let you go. You'll drink these two glasses."

Isabella stood speechless.

As Isabella struggled with what to do, the doctor suddenly said, "We have the results."

Charles's attention was immediately drawn. "Is she pregnant?"

The doctor said, "Yes, she is. Based on our assessment, she's been pregnant for at least two weeks."

"Two weeks." Charles did a quick calculation. "Yes, that's right. Exactly two weeks."

It had been exactly two weeks since he had sex with Siena.

This child was his! Charles laughed, and his laughter echoed throughout the room.

While Charles and the doctors were talking, Isabella took the opportunity to leave the study, but to her surprise, Emma was still outside, waiting.

As soon as she stepped out, she faced Emma. The door slowly closed behind Isabella, and the laughter from inside reached Emma's ears. A murderous look appeared in Emma's eyes as she coldly stared at Isabella. "Who told you to come out? Why didn't you leave the juice?"

Isabella kept her head down. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Landon."

Emma sneered coldly."You're scared, afraid of causing a death?"

Isabella silently agreed.

Emma scoffed, "You're afraid of causing a death but didn't consider the consequences of defying me? Since you are so deeply concerned about the lives of Charles and that woman, and aware of my poisoning scheme, I cannot allow you to leave. Drink these two glasses of juice yourself."

Isabella was speechless.

###chapter 289 Terror

Emma stared at her. "What, you don't dare to drink?"

Isabella squeezed the tray, then suddenly let go.

The tray fell from the air, crashing to the ground. The tray flipped, two wine glasses shattered, and juice spilled everywhere.

Before Emma could react, Isabella shoved her hard and ran down the hallway.

Emma was pushed against the wall, and by the time she realized what had happened, Isabella had already disappeared.

When the study door opened, Charles stood in the doorway, surveying the mess on the floor. His gaze finally landed on Emma's face. "Did you dare to poison the juice?"

Emma's pupils contracted sharply, and she shook her head. "No, I didn't."

Before she could move, Charles strode over, grabbed her hair, and dragged her toward the bedroom.

Isabella hadn't run far when she heard Emma's screams. She paused, then turned back. As she passed one of the rooms, the door suddenly opened, and a hand pulled her inside.

Isabella's scream was muffled by a hand covering her mouth. She stared wide-eyed, gradually recognizing the person in front of her.

It was a man, dressed in a suit, wearing black headphones and a black mask, with only his eyes visible.

Isabella recognized him immediately. "Matthew?"

Seeing her calm down, Matthew slowly released his hand, then grabbed her hand and led her to the closet. It was only then that Isabella realized this was Matthew's bedroom.

In the closet, Matthew opened one of the wardrobes, pushed all the clothes aside, revealing a hidden door. He unlocked the door with a key, then bent down and crawled into the passage.

Isabella, though shocked and bewildered, followed him in without hesitation.

The corridor was so narrow that it could accommodate only a single person, and even then, provided they were not too corpulent, lest they find themselves wedged in. It was pitch-dark but, thankfully, not overly extended; Isabella had to maneuver for merely a handful of seconds before the exit presented itself.

At the exit, there was a pile of clothes, densely packed, blocking the view, with only faint light seeping through the gaps.

When Isabella emerged, Matthew reached out to pull her up.

Isabella looked around, thinking, 'Have we crawled from one closet into another?'

"Where are we?" Isabella asked softly.

Suddenly, there was a noise outside. Matthew quickly gestured for silence, and Isabella obediently closed her mouth.

A scream echoed, and Isabella could feel Matthew's body tremble.

She glanced at Matthew, the dim light and his mask obscuring her view of his expression, but the complex emotions still shone through his eyes. There was anger and pain.

Isabella recognized Emma's voice. Something crashed to the floor, blending with pleas for mercy.

"It wasn't me; I didn't poison you!

"Charles, you have to believe me, I didn't do it!"

The sound was now very close to the wardrobe. Isabella reached out and pulled aside the clothes, revealing a scene in the bedroom through a gap.

Charles had Emma's hair in his grip, standing in front of a cupboard, withdrawing an intramuscular syringe from a box, expelling air bubbles from it.

"Charles, please, no!" Emma's eyes widened at the sight of the syringe.

But it was no use. In a split second, Charles plunged the needle into her neck with precision. Her scream of agony turned into a muffled moan of helpless pain. Within seconds, she collapsed like a mass of mud, her hand still clutching his trouser leg in a vain attempt to stand. Then, with a hiss, she managed to say, "Charles, you'll never find peace!"

Charles kicked her away, kicking her like trash coldly. "This is your punishment. I told you not to make me angry. Stay here and reflect on your actions."

With that, he closed the safe, turned around, and left with a confident stride.

Isabella was stunned, her eyes wide as she watched this unfold. Even though she knew about Charles'Â abusive behavior, seeing him inject her with the syringe left her deeply shaken.

She thought, 'Charles, he's truly terrifying.'

Matthew pushed aside the clothes and stepped out of the wardrobe.

Isabella hesitated for a moment before hurrying after him. Emma, lying on the ground, saw them leave. When she caught sight of Matthew, her face flushed with embarrassment and shame.

"Matthew." Emma's voice was weak.

Isabella could see the shame in her eyes, likely as a mother; she didn't want Matthew to see her like this, so helpless and without dignity.

Matthew walked over, picked her up gently, and placed her in a chair.

He couldn't speak now; all he could do was communicate with Emma through his eyes.

"Matthew, is that you?"Â Emma's eyes were filled with tears.

Matthew took her hand, gently removed his mask, and guided Emma's hand to his cheek.

Tears streamed down Emma's face. "Matthew, how could you just run away? Do you have any idea how worried I've been about you?"

Matthew shook his head, indicating that he was alright.

"Matthew, please listen to me. Go turn yourself in. You're still young, and you have a whole future ahead of you. I don't want to see you destroy it."

Matthew pressed his lips together and shook his head again.

Emma closed her eyes, realizing she couldn't persuade him. She turned to Isabella. "Bella."

Isabella stood nearby. "Mrs. Landon."

Seeing Isabella's attire, Emma understood what was going on. She said weakly, "Can you try to talk some sense into Matthew?"

Isabella stayed silent.

"Please, Bella, help me convince him. He's already made one mistake; he can't afford to make another."

Matthew gave Emma's hand one last squeeze before letting go. He then walked over to the safe and started working on unlocking it.

After several attempts, the combination still didn't work.

"Matthew, what are you doing?"Â Emma's voice trembled, but she was helpless to do anything.

Matthew stopped and looked back at Emma.

Realization crossed Emma's face, mixed with a trace of disappointment. "You came back for Isabella, didn't you? You're here to help her and Sebastian get the evidence?"

Matthew nodded.

Isabella looked at him in surprise. "Matthew."

Matthew glanced at her briefly before quickly averting his gaze.

For the first time, Isabella saw a glimpse of insecurity in him. It struck her heart, stirring an indescribable mix of emotions.

###chapter 290  How Could I Possibly Leave You Alone

Matthew pointed at the safe, his eyes resolute.

Emma was silent for a long time before she said, "Matthew, I'll tell you the password, but can you promise me one thing?"

Matthew nodded.

Emma then revealed the password to the safe.

Matthew successfully opened the safe and took out some documents and a USB drive, handing them all to Isabella.

Isabella hadn't expected things to go so smoothly. She actually got them!

She was a bit excited and quickly skimmed through some of the documents. "Thank you, Matthew. And thank you, Mrs. Landon."

Matthew still remained silent, holding Isabella's hand as they walked to the door. He opened the door, peeked outside, and then led Isabella downstairs.

Pushing open the side door, Matthew pointed to a black car parked outside.

"Sebastian?" Isabella recognized the car with delight and was about to step out when Matthew suddenly hugged her from behind.

Isabella froze. Matthew held her tightly, his whole body trembling slightly.

Isabella could feel his rapid breathing. When she tried to turn her head to look at him, Matthew pushed her away.

Isabella stumbled forward a few steps. When she turned back, the side door was already closed.

"Bella." Sebastian got out of the car to greet her personally.

Once in the car, Isabella eagerly handed him the documents."These were taken from Charles's safe. They are all evidence of Charles's crimes! Sebastian, we can call the police and have him arrested now."

Isabella was a bit emotional, as the shadow of Charles had loomed over her and Sebastian's lives for too long.

As soon as she finished speaking, the sound of police sirens filled the air.

Isabella thought, 'It turns out Sebastian has already arranged everything.'

Sebastian reached out, tucking a strand of hair behind Isabella's ear, his tone gentle. "I told you to leave, didn't I? Why are you back?"

"You couldn't bear to let me take the risk, so how could I leave you alone?" Isabella's eyes welled up with tears.

"Bella." Sebastian cupped the back of her head and kissed her.

Charles was arrested. In addition to the evidence Isabella had obtained, Leo later provided more evidence. Besides commercial crimes, they also discovered he had secretly established a lab to develop illegal drugs. With all the combined charges, the lawyer assumed that all of Charles's assets would be confiscated, and he would face life imprisonment.

During this time, Charles was also seeking a lawyer, trying to overturn the case. But the evidence was overwhelming, both physical and testimonial. This time, there was no way he could turn things around.

While the lawyer and Sebastian were talking in the living room, Isabella felt stifled and excused herself to the kitchen to make tea.

Outside the window, flowers were blooming, basking in the sunlight and swaying in the wind. Isabella stared at the flowers for a long time, feeling repressed.

The kettle whistled, bringing her back to reality. She carried the tray out.

As she reached the kitchen door, she overheard Sebastian asking, "Is there no way to get the death penalty?"

Isabella paused. The death penalty?Charles was indeed hateful, but he was still Sebastian's father. Isabella had always thought that even if Sebastian hated him, he wouldn't want Charles dead.

It seemed she was wrong.

"Bella." Sebastian's voice startled her. He was suddenly standing before her. "Why are you daydreaming here?"

"Nothing." Isabella smiled. "Is Mr. Fitzgerald leaving?"

"Yes." Fabian Fitzgerald nodded at her and then said to Sebastian, "Mr. Landon, keep in touch."

Sebastian said, "Will do."

After seeing Fabian off, Isabella and Sebastian sat in the living room drinking tea.

The aroma of the tea swirled around them, but Isabella's mind was elsewhere.

Sebastian's phone rang again. He got up and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window to answer it. His deep voice echoed in the room, and Isabella watched his back, lost in thought. "

A few minutes later, Sebastian hung up. "Something's come up at the company. Bella, do you want to come with me?"

Isabella shook her head and asked, "Sebastian, when are we going to Emerald Isle City?"

"Tomorrow," Sebastian replied. "I've already asked Jack to book the tickets."

Isabella agreed. "Okay."

Isabella went to the Jose family, intending to visit Nina.

After Nina was kidnapped by Elodie last time, they had talked on the phone and video chatted. Richard had taken good care of Nina, and she had recovered. But they hadn't met in person.Since Isabella was going to Emerald Isle City with Sebastian tomorrow, she desired to see Nina.

Unfortunately, Nina wasn't home. She was out with Richard.

Margaret complained, "Ever since Nina and Richard started dating, she rarely comes home. They're always glued together!"

"Although I feel for Nina, I don't dare to interfere too much, fearing she'll get upset with me. She had such a hard time before, and now that she's happy, it's a good thing. I'm just worried about Richard."

"I don't know what he does for a living, but he seems to have a dark side. I'm afraid he might hurt Nina."

Isabella reassured her. "He won't. I trust Nina's judgment."

Margaret sighed. "You're right. All we can do is trust and support her."

After leaving the Jose family, Isabella ran into Ophelia.

Ophelia was probably in the area visiting a friend, and there was a wealthy woman in her car.

As they passed Isabella, the car stopped, and Ophelia rolled down the window, sneering. "Ms. Miller, congratulations on finally winning this battle."

Isabella had only interacted with Ophelia few times and had no prejudice against her, but she found her difficult to deal with. If Nathaniel still held shares, Isabella might have considered Sebastian and been more diplomatic with Ophelia. But now, there was no need.

Facing Ophelia's sarcasm, Isabella remained calm and replied, "Thank you for your congratulations."

Ophelia wrapped her shawl tighter and continued to mock, "Oh, everyone in Lakina knows now that Mr. Landon is lucky to have a smart and capable wife who helped him bring down his own father! But Ms. Miller, I must advise you not to go too far. After all, Emma helped you before. You shouldn't be so ruthless, sending Matthew to prison and Charles too, leaving no way out for them."

Isabella frowned. "What do you mean?"

Ophelia rolled her eyes. "You really don't know? Emma and Matthew have both disappeared."

Isabella really didn't know.

It had been several days since Charles's birthday party.Initially, Isabella had even considered having Emma come forward to accuse Charles of illegal drug use and domestic violence. She had called Emma, but Emma had refused.

###chapter 291  You're Here

Now, Emma had disappeared with Matthew. Isabella recalled that Emma had been making arrangements in Monsterwania. Could it be that they took advantage of the chaos to escape there?

But that night, Emma clearly wanted to persuade Matthew to turn himself in.

The crimes Charles committed actually had nothing to do with them. Matthew would only face a few months in jail at most. Even if he escaped this time, it would only add a year at most. Emma had been able to wait for Matthew to get out so they could settle in Monsterwania. But Emma taking Matthew and fleeing now meant they could never return to the country, which was the most unwise choice.

"Ms. Miller, I've said all I can. Take care of yourself." With that, Ophelia put on her sunglasses and drove away.

Isabella went to the Landon family estate.Â 

The once-grand Landon family estate was now sealed off. There were seals on the doors, and the yard still had remnants of balloons and streamers from that night, with a pervasive sense of desolation and decay. The former glory was gone, and the people and events of the past seemed to have faded away with the wind.

In the evening, Isabella was packing her things, preparing for her trip to Emerald Isle City the next day.

he lawyer warned that the trip might not be easy. Besides the complicated procedures, there might be significant resistance from the adoptive parents, so it could take a long time. Isabella and Sebastian needed to be prepared. If it really was Sweetie, she would do whatever it took to bring Sweetie back.

Besides their own clothes, Isabella also bought two little dresses, shoes, socks, and hats for Sweetie.

Now, everything was just waiting for the meeting.

The phone rang, interrupting her drifting thoughts.

Isabella picked up the phone and saw the name "Emma" on the screen, feeling a bit dazed.

It was clearly just yesterday's people and events, but today, it felt like a lifetime ago.

Ophelia's words echoed in her mind as Isabella answered the phone, "Hello."

Emma said calmly, "Isabella, we plan to leave Lakina. Before we go, I want to meet you."

"Meet me?" Isabella was surprised and also a bit wary. "Where are you planning to go, Monsterwania? Emma, Matthew is still a fugitive. If you leave now, you can never come back. Have you thought this through?"

Out of goodwill, Isabella still wanted to persuade Matthew to turn himself in.

But Emma said, "Once we leave, it's forever. We don't plan to come back."

Knowing Emma had made up her mind, Isabella didn't bother trying to persuade her. She glanced around, wondering if she could call the police and have them track the number to catch them.

"Bella, don't think about catching us. There are some things I want to tell you in person," Emma said, "If you still want to know your daughter's whereabouts, you'd better come. Remember, don't tell anyone, or I am certain you'll never see your daughter again."

Emma hung up after saying that.

Isabella didn't hesitate and called Sebastian. She couldn't hide something like this from Sebastian and take the risk alone!

Just as the call connected, a text message came in.

Isabella opened the text message, and it was a picture. In the picture was a pink baby, not fully showing the face, but when Isabella saw the child, her heart clenched tightly.

Isabella was excited. "Sweetie!"

It was her! Her Sweetie, her long-lost daughter.

Then, another video came through.

Isabella quickly opened it. In the video, the child was no longer still. Her little hand was clenched into a fist, waving in the air, then she put it in her mouth and started sucking on it.

The video was only three seconds long, but Isabella watched it several times, reluctant to close it.

At this moment, the call connected, and Sebastian's voice came through the receiver. "Bella, what's wrong?"

Isabella looked at the video of Sweetie, biting her lip hard.

Two minutes later, Isabella was speeding towards the remote dock on the outskirts of the city.

The harbor was shrouded in darkness, the salty sea breeze whipping at Isabella's face. She ran among the yachts but couldn't find any trace of Emma and Matthew.

Isabella was agitated, not knowing if it was from running or from worry. When she stopped, her legs went so weak that she couldn't move another step. The yachts docked on both sides were densely packed, like giant monsters that could come to life at any moment and devour her whole.

At this moment, the sound of a dinghy approached, and a beam of light shone directly on Isabella.

She raised her hand to block the light, watching as the dinghy slowed down near the shore. When it docked, a man stepped off. "Are you Ms. Miller?"

Isabella nodded, a certain suspicion already forming in her mind.

The man said, "Emma asked me to pick you up. Get on the dinghy."

Isabella asked, "Aren't they here?"

"Oh, they're on the yacht," the man answered nonchalantly.

"The yacht isn't docked?" Isabella asked again.

The man seemed puzzled. "Didn't Emma tell you? Emma said she forgot her daughter while sailing and asked me to pick you up. Aren't you her daughter?"

From his innocent and confused expression, Isabella guessed he was probably just an uninformed person.

"Are you getting on or not?" Isabella's hesitation made the man uneasy.

"Yes, I am!" Isabella got on the dinghy.

As the dinghy turned around and sped away from the shore, Isabella looked back at a certain spot on the shore.

The dinghy moved quickly, and the farther it got from the shore, the dimmer the surrounding light became. The sea breeze made it hard to keep her eyes open. Isabella tightly gripped the handles on both sides, her whole body tense.

After about twenty minutes, she finally saw a lit-up presence.

The dinghy slowed down, and as it got closer, Isabella saw it was a three-story yacht.

The man carefully maneuvered the dinghy closer to the yacht and secured it with a rope. The surrounding sea breeze slowed down, and only the sound of the waves could be heard.

Isabella looked back and saw that the shore was no longer visible, surrounded by the dark sea. Looking down, she felt a sense of dread.

With the man's help, Isabella successfully boarded the yacht.

Emma stood on the deck, wrapped in a black striped shawl, her makeup and hair immaculate. She watched Isabella step by step up to the deck, her face almost expressionless. "Isabella, you're here."

###chapter 292 Stop Going Crazy

Isabella walked onto the deck, watching the inflatable boat drift away, the sound gradually fading until it was no longer audible.

All the surrounding noise disappeared. They were drifting on the sea with this cruise ship, as if isolated from the world in a serene manner.

Isabella withdrew her gaze. "Emma, where is my daughter?"

Emma turned around, looking at her expressionlessly, and said, "Follow me."

With that, she turned to enter the cabin.

In this situation, Isabella had no choice but to follow Emma.

The cabin was more spacious than Isabella had imagined. After passing through a long corridor, Emma pushed open a door. When Isabella saw Emma's figure disappear through the door,Â she quickened her pace to follow.

As soon as Isabella pushed open the door, the lights in the room went out. A hand reached out from the darkness, tightly gripping Isabella's wrist, sending a sharp pain and a feeling of numbness through her arm.

Isabella screamed, but before she could resist, her body went limp.

The lights came back on, and Emma supported her onto a nearby sofa.

Isabella's eyes were open, her mind still clear, but her limbs were weak and gradually losing sensation.

It was exactly the same as that night when Emma was pricked by Charles.

Isabella glared at Emma, her voice equally weak. "Emma, what are you doing?"

Emma threw the syringe into the trash can with a dull thud. She didn't answer Isabella's question but instead walked to the wardrobe, opened it, and took out a set of clothes.

Emma held the outfit and walked up to Isabella, her fingers tracing the exquisite patterns on the fabric. She then asked Isabella, "Do you think this looks beautiful?"

Isabella glared at her. It was a wedding dress!

"This is something I picked out especially for you." Emma looked at Isabella, her eyes a bit off. It seemed like she was talking to Isabella, but also like she was talking to herself. No matter how Isabella looked at it, there was an eerie vibe.

"After all, marriage is a big deal. Don't you think?"

Isabella gritted her teeth, sweating profusely from the effort. "I think you're crazy!"

Did Emma lure her here in the dead of night merely to have her admire this wedding dress?

Emma laughed, a laugh devoid of warmth. She put the dress down, walked over, and bent down to take off Isabella's coat.

Isabella's eyes widened, her breathing slightly rapid. "What are you doing?"

"Bella, don't be afraid. I'm going to change your clothes." Emma ignored Isabella's fear and continued muttering. She helped Isabella take off her clothes and then picked up the wedding dress to put it on Isabella.

The cold touch made Isabella break out in goosebumps, her voice trembling. "Emma, what Charles did has nothing to do with you and Matthew. Even if the court makes its decision, you and Matthew can start over. Don't go crazy like this!"

Isabella's persuasion was sincere, yet it was evident that Emma paid no heed, continuing to ramble on, "Yes, we can finally start a new life. Bella, once you and Matthew are married, I can rest easy. I know Matthew has a bad temper. Because he was influenced by me and Charles, but it won't be like that anymore. Charles will never come out again, and I'll protect you both. I won't let him bully you!Rest assured, with me here, everything will be taken care of."

Isabella was utterly shocked. "Marry Matthew?"

She finally realized thatEmma and Matthew had gone so far as to use this method of kidnapping to force her to marry Matthew?

Isabella thought, 'this is too absurd!'

After helping her change into the dress, Emma guided her to a vanity mirror. Fixing Isabella in the chair, Emma began to apply makeup.

Isabella tried to calm herself down. "Where is Matthew? I want to see him!"

Isabella thought Emma might have been traumatized and gone mad, but Matthew shouldn't be like this. After all, it was Matthew who gave her the evidence, and he should have anticipated this outcome.

"Don't worry. After the ceremony, you'll see him. Bella, I understand how you feel. But a wedding has its rules, we can't break them. Once everything is over and all the guests are gone, you can close the door and have a good talk with Matthew. I won't disturb you." Emma's face was full of joy.

Isabella's mind was in turmoil.

There were actually guests at this wedding? But the cruise ship was eerily quiet. When Isabella came in, there wasn't a sound. How could there be any guests?

Moreover, with the Landon family in such trouble, those people from the past were probably eager to distance themselves. How could they possibly come to the middle of the ocean in the dead of night to attend such a bizarre wedding?

"All done," Emma chirped.

She walked around Isabella, standing behind the chair, bending down, and placing her hands on Isabella's shoulders, looking at Isabella in the mirror. "You look beautiful."

Isabella looked at her heavily made-up face in the mirror and almost fainted.

The makeup, ghastly pale, looked like a thick layer of plaster. The blush on her cheeks was exaggerated, and even her lips were painted into a small mouth. It was the makeup of a ghost bride

But Emma stared at Isabella's face, looking very satisfied.

Maybe Isabella had been shocked too many times. So at this moment, when she saw her weird Â  makeup, Isabella didn't even find it too outrageous.

Next, Emma styled her hair, then helped her into a wheelchair, pushing her out.

###chapter 293 In This Lifetime, It Has to Be Him

Emma said, "Alright, the wedding begins."

Isabella suddenly spoke up, "I don't agree with this marriage!"

"What did you say?" Emma's voice abruptly stopped, her cold questioning carrying a hint of harshness.

"I don't agree with this marriage," Isabella repeated loudly, "Matthew, say something!"

Matthew did not answer her.

"Bella, it's too late now. You're getting married today, whether you like it or not!" Emma said, pressing Isabella's head down again.

Isabella said, "I am already married. How can I marry again?"

Emma said, "What nonsense are you talking about?"

Isabella took in everything around her, her first reaction was to look at Matthew.

At this moment, Matthew was wearing a black patterned wedding suit, with a flower pinned to his chest. His posture was limp, his head drooping lifelessly to one side, devoid of any vitality.

Even though she had suspected it, seeing this scene still left Isabella speechless with shock. Matthew was dead!

Emma said, "Bella, don't talk nonsense!"

Isabella shook her head. "Emma, I have long been Sebastian's woman and we have a child. In this life, I will only marry him. Even if you force me to go through with this ridiculous wedding today, I will never truly belong to Matthew!"

Emma gritted her teeth, her eyes filled with hatred. "Isabella, do you know that Matthew gave up his life for you? He sacrificed so much, and this is how you repay him? You are so ungrateful!"

Isabella shook her head, unable to understand Emma at this moment. "You really need to stop this madness. Matthew is already dead, so let him rest in peace!"

"What are you talking about?" Emma glared at her viciously, her arm gently cradling Matthew's corpse. "I am his mother. I would never do anything to hurt him. Isabella, do you know that even in his final moments, Matthew was still thinking of you? That's how much he loved you."

Isabella said, "If he truly loved me, he wouldn't have caused so much trouble. You and Charles always claimed to love Matthew, but you two were the ones who tormented him the most!"

"Shut up!" Emma shouted. "I won't let you speak of Matthew that way! Matthew was the best child in the world. He was sensible, obedient, gentle, kind, and warm. He was everything a mother could ask for. And you... you ruined him! It's all your fault, Isabella!"

Emma wiped away her tears and said, "Matthew, I couldn't help you be with the one you loved while you were alive, but after your passing, I will bring her to your side."

She straightened up, pulled out a bottle of gasoline from the corner, opened the cap, and started pouring it everywhere.

"Emma!" No matter how Isabella shouted, Emma seemed not to hear, frantically pouring gasoline.

At this moment, the sound of police sirens suddenly came from outside.

Emma paused, her fierce gaze sweeping towards Isabella. "You told Sebastian?"

"Yes," Isabella seized the last chance to persuade Emma to turn back, "Emma, please stop. I don't know how Matthew died, but I guess he must have been really desperate, so he finally chose this path."

Emma and Charles raised a child with a dual personality, and ultimately, they destroyed Matthew with their own hands!

Isabella glanced at Matthew. His expression was serene, as if he had not suffered much pain or agony in death, but rather left with a sense of comfort and relief.

Isabella said, "I think, maybe Matthew was atoning for you, or maybe for Charles. If he saw you like this, he would be very pained."

"Emma, the dead cannot come back to life. If you believe in spirits, you should know that when parents do bad things, their children suffer in the afterlife. Maybe Matthew's spirit is watching you right now."

Perhaps Isabella's last words struck a chord with Emma. Emma's expression stiffened, and she began to look around. "Matthew, are you really here? Can you hear me?"

Emma searched frantically, pulling at anything in her way. Her voice gradually took on a crying tone. "Matthew, please come out to see me, won't you? I miss you so much! I really miss you!"

Emma had gone mad. She had lost her mind. Sometimes she cried loudly, sometimes she laughed hysterically, muttering to herself, "Matthew, I can't bear to lose you. How can I live without you? Why didn't you wait for me? Why did you leave me alone?"

Isabella watched this scene, feeling a deep sense of discomfort. She hadn't expected that Matthew's parting that day would be their final farewell.

Matthew, she should hate him. But now, with his life gone, she found she couldn't muster the hatred.Â 

A shadow fell across the cabin door, and Isabella knew Sebastian was there.

In the corner, Emma suddenly stood up. She pulled out a lighter, and with a click, a flame ignited.

At that moment, Sebastian's figure appeared at the door. "Bella."

"Stay back!" Isabella shouted.

But she couldn't stop Sebastian, nor could she stop Emma.

As Sebastian stepped in, the lighter fell to the ground. In an instant, the flame ignited, spreading through the gasoline-soaked room in the blink of an eye.

###chapter 294 The Last Gift

The only place without gasoline was where Matthew and Isabella were.

After Emma lost her lighter, she walked over, pulled a chair, and sat next to Matthew. She held Matthew's corpse, then took Isabella's hand and placed it on Matthew's cold hand.

Emma said, "The three of us can finally be together forever. Matthew, I brought Bella to find you. Don't go too fast. Wait for us."

Emma slowly closed her eyes, even a smile appeared on her lips. Moments later, blood seeped from the corner of her mouth.

Isabella thought, 'Emma must have taken poison in advance.'

Tonight, Emma had no intention of living. Of course, she didn't intend for Isabella to live either.

"Mr. Landon!" Jack's voice rang out. He and a group of people were blocked outside by the fire.

Isabella suddenly snapped back to reality, only to see Sebastian walking through the wall of fire, straight to her.

"Sebastian." Isabella's voice was trembling.

Sebastian took off his coat, wrapped it around her, and held Isabella in his arms."Bella, don't be afraid. I'm here."

The thick smoke from the intense fire was suffocating.

Sebastian looked at the inferno, knowing they had to escape now or never.

He held Isabella tightly. "Bella, I'm taking you out."

Isabella was already too choked by the smoke to speak. She didn't even have the strength to nod.

Sebastian carried her through the wall of fire, the last thing Isabella saw was Emma and Matthew's bodies being consumed by the flames.

The fire raged at sea for a whole day and night. It wasn't until the last spark was extinguished that it finally sank into the sea.

Three days later, Charles received the news.

After that, he requested to see Isabella.

In the visiting room, Charles sat alone for ten minutes. When the door opened, he looked up to see not only Isabella but also Sebastian.

Seeing Sebastian, Charles frowned, his eyes filled with disgust. "Who let you in? Get out! I don't want to see you!"

Sebastian didn't care about his cold rebuke, so he didn't even respond. He pulled out a chair and let Isabella sit down first.

Charles looked at the loving couple in front of him, more infuriated. "How ironic, even the devil has love."

Isabella looked at him. After a few days of rest, she had regained her strength and was much calmer. "They said you were clamoring to see me. If you have something to say, please say it."

Charles raised his hand, pointing at Sebastian, and questioned Isabella, "Someone like him doesn't deserve love. Isabella, you've been deceived by him!"

Isabella remained calm. "I should know better than you what kind of person Sebastian is. If you slander him one more time, I will leave immediately!"

Charles was stunned, and then laughed out loud. "Ridiculous, truly ridiculous! Foolish, truly foolish!"

Isabella stood up. "It seems we have nothing to talk about."

"Isabella!" Charles became agitated. He suddenly stood up, his shackled hands banging on the table. "Do you really know the man beside you? Are you sure you know? The devil's offspring is still a devil. A deceiver like Anna could only give birth to a devil. But she probably didn't expect that it was this very demon she gave birth to that sent her to her death!"

Isabella suddenly turned around, looking at him in shock.

Seeing her reaction, Charles laughed. "He must have told you a beautiful story, making himself look clean, right? Then let me tell you the truth."

He slowly raised his left hand, pointing his index finger straight at Sebastian, and said word by word, "The abortion medicine back then, it was him who handed it to Anna. And It was him who watched Anna drink that bowl of medicine, then suffer from abdominal pain and bleed profusely. In the end, she died in front of the bed!"

Isabella looked at Sebastian in shock.

Sebastian just stood there silently, remaining silent.

Charles's maniacal laughter echoed throughout the room. "He killed Anna! The ridiculous thing is thatAnna begged me to spare his life before she died. Ridiculous, truly ridiculous!"

Sebastian suddenly chuckled.

Charles froze, then he stared at him. "What are you laughing at? How can you still laugh?"

Sebastian looked up, meeting those angry eyes. "Do you know what I regret the most over the years? It's that I stood by my mother's bed, holding a fruit knife, but spared your life. Charles, you're a madman!"

Charles shouted, "I'm a madman, then what about you? Sebastian, what are you? You're the son of a madman and a devil. Even if you killed Matthew, you'll never redeem yourself!"

Sebastian sneered. "Did you forget? I'm not your son."

Charles was shocked.

Sebastian continued, "When I was five, didn't you already do a paternity test? What, you thought I never knew?"

"Yes!" Charles gritted his teeth, the veins on his forehead almost bursting, his eyes almost bloodshot. "You're a bastard! Anna cheated on me. You're a bastard, who can't see the light of day. No matter how high you climb, you're still a bastard!"

"Is that so?" Sebastian was noncommittal.

At this moment, Jack knocked and entered. "Here's the paternity test report you requested."

Isabella clearly saw the words on the cover:[ Paternity Test Report.]

Sebastian didn't even look at it. He directly threw it in front of Charles. "Take a look at this."

Those words came into Charles's view, but he was cautious and didn't move, instead, he asked Sebastian, "What is this?"

"A paternity test report," Sebastian said, "It's also the last gift I give you."

After saying that, he took Isabella's hand and said softly, "Bella, let's go."

Isabella nodded but couldn't help but look back.

Before they walked out, she saw Charles reach out and pick up the report.

The door closed, Sebastian stopped at the entrance.

After about two minutes, Charles's roar suddenly erupted from inside, "Impossible, this is impossible! Fake, this is fake. Sebastian, you lied to me; you lied to me!" The roar was heart-wrenching.

Two days later, Charles committed suicide in prison.

Isabella accompanied Sebastian to sign the papers. A prison guard came over and handed a letter to Sebastian. "Mr. Landon, this is a letter Charles left for you. He asked us to make sure it gets to you."

Sebastian glanced at it but didn't take it, instead, he said, "Please burn it with his body."

###chapter 295  The Truth

On the plane to Emerald Isle City, Sebastian kept having nightmares.

After landing, Sebastian fell ill.

With Marvin absent, Isabella had to take him to the hospital with Jack.

After treatment, Sebastian's emotions gradually stabilized, then he fell into a deep sleep.

Jack said, "Why don't you go back to the hotel first? I can stay with Mr. Landon."

Isabella shook her head. Even if she went back to the hotel, she wouldn't be able to sleep. She felt more at ease staying with Sebastian.

Jack said no more.

In the middle of the night, Isabella, half-asleep, felt someone touching her face.

She looked up to find Sebastian awake, lying quietly on the pillow, looking at her tenderly.

"Sebastian, you're awake?" Isabella immediately lost all sleepiness and leaned closer to ask, "How are you feeling now? Is there any discomfort? Should I call the doctor?"

She got up to call the doctor, but Sebastian grabbed her wrist and pulled her back.

"Bella, you've worked so hard," Sebastian murmured tenderly as he embraced her.

Isabella's face rested on Sebastian's chest, listening to his strong, healthy heartbeat. Her anxious heart gradually calmed down. "Do you know that you started running a high fever as soon as you boarded the plane. You were almost delirious and kept mumbling incoherently. No matter how much I called out to you, there was no response. It was freaking me out."

"Sorry," Sebastian said, stroking her hair. "I made you worry. It's my fault."

Isabella shook her head and touched his forehead. " Your temperature seems to have gone down a lot. Would you like some water?"

"No need," Sebastian said, holding her hand tightly. "I don't need anything, just stay with me for a while."

"Okay," Isabella nodded. She took off her shoes and climbed onto the hospital bed.

Sebastian pulled the blanket over her thin body, and they snuggled closely together.

Though it was the middle of the night and everything was quiet, Isabella found herself wide awake. She wanted to say something but, worried about Sebastian's weakness, she just remained quiet and nestled against him, listening to his heartbeat as her thoughts began to wander.

After a while, Sebastian spoke softly, "Bella."

"What's up?" Isabella responded immediately.

Sebastian said, "Actually, there were two paternity test reports."

Isabella looked up at Sebastian's determined jawline. "One for Charles and Matthew, and the other for you and Charles?"

"Yes," Sebastian nodded, swallowing hard.

Isabella said, "Charles reacted so strongly at the time. Did the report say that Matthew wasn't his biological son?"

She hadn't asked about it after it happened. She could guess some of it, though not in detail.

She knew this was a sensitive topic for Sebastian. Unless he was ready to talk about it, anyone else bringing it up would only cause him more pain.

Isabella didn't want to touch it. If Sebastian wanted to talk, she would be the best listener. If he wanted to keep it to himself, she didn't mind.

Now that Sebastian was willing to talk, Isabella could feel his struggle and pain. She was willing to take the initiative to console him, hoping to help him overcome his emotional block sooner rather than later.

"Yes," Sebastian nodded, his voice low. "I've always had my suspicions. I didn't think my mom was that kind of person. Living in the Landon family for so many years, there were many clues, but I could never confirm it."

"I hate Charles!" Sebastian spat out the words, his body tense and rigid.

Sebastian continued, "He tricked me into giving her the abortion pills. He told me it was a tonic to calm her and help with the pregnancy. I believed him.

"I watched my mom drink that bowl of medicine, then she started having severe abdominal pain and bleeding." Sebastian's voice trembled. Even after all these years, the memory of that scene still twisted him in pain.

After calming down a bit, Sebastian continued, "I ran downstairs to call for help, but the phone line had been cut. Then I heard my mom's screams. When I ran back upstairs, she was lying by the bed, her eyes wide and vacant, barely alive.

"I tried to rush to her, but Charles grabbed me by the collar. He dragged me to the balcony, trying to throw me off. At that time, I had a fruit knife in my hand. I wanted to kill him, but I couldn't do it. I clung desperately to the railing, determined not to let myself fall. When the knife dropped, Charles stunned and then pulled me back, throwing me to the ground."

Sebastian's fingers clenched. "I'm sorry, Bella. I lied to you before. My mom wasn't beaten to death by Charles. She was killed by that abortion drug. I killed her and the baby in her womb!"

"And all these years, I've been avoiding this fact! Charles was right. No matter how high I climb, I'll always be a sinner."

Isabella shook her head, holding Sebastian tightly. "Sebastian, none of this is your fault. It's all Charles's fault. He has already perished. Don't keep these things in your heart. If Anna knew, it would break her heart to see you like this."

"Bella," Sebastian closed his eyes, a tear silently falling. He opened his eyes again, looking at the ceiling, a self-mocking smile on his face. "Charles was right. I'm just a bastard."

Sebastian said, "I always thought Emma tampered with the paternity test report. That she switched my and Matthew's reports. Until yesterday, those two reports showed that Matthew wasn't his child. And neither am I."

Isabella was also shocked. This result was something she hadn't expected.

Pain flashed in Sebastian's eyes. "Bella, my mom really cheated!"

Finally, Isabella understood why Sebastian fell ill.

She had thought it was because of Emma and Matthew's deaths, because of Charles's death, and because of the pain brought by the truth.

But now Isabella understood. What broke Sebastian wasn't anyone else; it was his mother, Anna, whom he had always held dear!

In Sebastian's heart, Anna had always been noble and pure, untainted and beyond reproach. But in the end, he found out that Anna wasn't so pure. At least, the paternity test report indeed showed that Anna had done something wrong in her marriage. And Sebastian was the result of that wrongdoing!

His faith collapsed, and so did Sebastian's world.

Isabella's heart ached, making it hard to breathe. She couldn't imagine the pain and torment Sebastian had been enduring these past few days.

"Sebastian." Isabella saw Sebastian's eyes darkening, and she was deeply alarmed.

If this continued, Sebastian would be in serious trouble!

###chapter 296 Going to See Sweetie

"Sebastian," Isabella held Sebastian tightly, "none of this is your fault. Adult marriages have nothing to do with children; children are innocent. Whether it's Charles or Anna, the consequences of their actions shouldn't fall on you."

Sebastian stared blankly at the ceiling. "Bella, I shouldn't exist."

"No!" Isabella gently kissed the corner of Sebastian's mouth. "I don't know how you were before, but from now on, you are my husband, Sweetie's father, and our support. Sebastian, I won't allow anything to happen to you!"

At the mention of Sweetie, a spark lit up in Sebastian's eyes. He looked at Isabella's tear-streaked face, his expression laden with guilt. "I'm sorry, Bella, for causing you worry. Rest assured. I will protect both you and Sweetie with all my heart."

Isabella said, "Yes, I believe you will."

The next morning, when Jack entered the room, he saw Sebastian and Isabella sleeping together on one bed, holding each other.

It was still early. They were still sleeping soundly, so Jack didn't disturb them. He quietly closed the door and left.

Jack went downstairs to buy breakfast. When he came back, he spotted a woman who looked vaguely familiar.

At the reception desk, a young woman in casual clothes clutched a child, her voice filled with worry. "Doctor, how is my child? Is she okay?"

The doctor said, "It's just a high fever seizure. Take her upstairs to rest, and she'll be fine after treatment."

Â "Okay, thank you, doctor." The woman then took the child to the elevator.

Jack didn't take the same elevator, but he was puzzled. 'Vanessa in Emerald Isle City?'

After Charlie's death, Sebastian had asked him to investigate Vanessa's whereabouts. Jack knew Vanessa had left Lakina, returned to her hometown, and got married. But he didn't expect Vanessa to have a child so soon.

Although the past was over, Jack still felt that Vanessa was always an unpleasant memory and it was best not to let her meet Sebastian and Isabella. Therefore, Jack didn't mention this matter in front of them.

Sebastian was in good spirits today, probably because Isabella's comfort last night was quite effective. He had once again regained his former decisiveness and efficiency.

The three of them had breakfast in the hospital room and then went to the police station to handle the paperwork. They signed a bunch of documents and had to do a paternity test at last.

After wasting the whole morning, Isabella was a bit anxious. "Can we see the child first?"

The police said, "The adoptive parents were exceptionally vigilant and resolute, as they possessed the legal adoption papers.They strongly request a paternity test. Once the results show that you are the biological parents, even if they are unwilling, we will forcibly bring the child to you."

Although anxious, everything had to follow the procedure. Isabella had no choice but to nod helplessly. "Okay."

Leaving the police station, Isabella was still a bit distracted.

Sebastian squeezed her hand. "Do you want to see Sweetie?"

Isabella looked at him. "Yes, but."

"I'll take you to see her. How about that?" Sebastian's eyes were gentle. He lightly brushed her cheek, tucking her hair behind her ear.

Isabella's eyes lit up. "You have a way?"

Sebastian smiled slightly. "What could be difficult for me?"

Isabella was confused, "But the police station said."

Sebastian said, " Before coming, I had someone check the adoptive parents' address. We can go there now."

Isabella's spirits lifted again. "Right, why didn't I think of that?"

The rules didn't allow them to go, but they could secretly go see Sweetie.

Just seeing Sweetie and knowing she was okay would put Isabella's mind at ease, even if they had to wait a few more days.

Jack drove to an old neighborhood. As soon as they reached the entrance, a man was already standing there, looking around as if waiting for something.

Jack drove over and rolled down the window. "Are you Mr. Montgomery?"

"Yes, yes." Maximilian Montgomery nodded quickly. "Are you Mr. Brown?"

"That's me." Jack nodded. "Can we go in now?"

"Yes, follow me." Maximilian said, turning to lead the way into the neighborhood. When passing the security booth, Maximilian specifically greeted the security guard, probably saying they were his relatives, so the security guard let the car pass.

At the same time, Maximilian glanced back at the license plate, a puzzled look on his face.

When the car was parked, Isabella and the others got out, and Maximilian asked, "Who are these two?"

Jack explained, "This is my boss and his wife. They are here to see the house today."

"Oh, I see." Maximilian nodded. "I noticed your license plate is from out of town?"

"Yes." Jack nodded. "Our boss is setting up a branch here. He doesn't come often, but when he does, he doesn't like staying in hotels. So, he thought of buying an old house, renovating it a bit, and staying there for a night or two. When he arrived in the area, he happened to see that you were selling a house nearby, so we decided to come and have a look."

Maximilian found this reasonable and had no more doubts. The conversation then shifted to the house.

Isabella listened for a while before understanding. Weren't they here to see Sweetie? How did it turn into looking at a house?

But it wasn't convenient to ask at the moment, so Isabella suppressed her doubts and followed them upstairs.

It was an old building without an elevator. Maximilian lived on the fourth floor. The stairwell was relatively clean, with open windows and no unpleasant odors. At Maximilian's door, a brown door came into view, with a fluffy rabbit toy hanging on it.

The cute rabbit toy seemed out of place on the old door, and didn't quite match Maximilian's simple, middle-aged appearance.

As Maximilian saw the rabbit, his eyes softened. While unlocking the door, he explained somewhat embarrassedly, "My daughter likes this, so we bought her many. My wife hung one on the door. "Pardon the clutter."

"Not at all," Jack said, "I didn't expect Maximilian to be such a loving father."

Maximilian smiled, his face radiating happiness and contentment.

Isabella thought, ' He really seems to love his daughter.'

The door swung open, revealing precisely what Maximilian had described. The house was teeming with rabbit plushies-strewn across the coffee table, scattered on the sofa, and even perched atop the cabinet near the entrance.

Maximilian handed them shoe covers. "My wife likes to keep things tidy. Sorry for the trouble."

As soon as he finished speaking, a baby's cry came from inside the house.

Maximilian told them to look around and hurriedly went to the inner room to check on the baby.

Isabella put on the shoe covers and exchanged a glance with Sebastian. Could this be Sweetie's adoptive parents' home?

Sebastian nodded slightly.

At that moment, Maximilian came out, holding a baby bottle, and hurried to the kitchen to prepare formula. As he went about this task, his attentiveness was astonishing. The cautious way he executed every step portrayed him as a loving and tender father.

Isabella thought,' if Sweetie had spent the past few months in this home, at least she would have been happy and loved, not suffering.'

"Maximilian, what are you doing? Why isn't it ready yet? Look how hungry our Abby is," a woman's voice called out. Mira Nakamura, a woman in her middle years, emerged from the inner room with a child in her arms. Upon seeing the people inside the house, she abruptly fell silent.

###chapter 297 Can I hug you?

Isabella immediately noticed the child in Mira's arms. But because the baby was wrapped in a blanket, she couldn't see the child's face. Just hearing the baby's cries was almost unbearable for her. It felt as though an invisible hand gripped her heart, causing a sharp, unbearable pain that Isabella found impossible to put into words. When she saw the small blanket, she froze.

Perhaps Isabella's gaze was too intense, as Mira at the door became very wary. She shielded the baby with her arm and nervously asked, "Maximilian, who is this?"

Maximilian, having just prepared the formula, walked out while shaking the bottle."They're here to look at the house."

He walked past Isabella. "Come on! The formula is ready. Go inside and feed the baby."

"Okay." Mira took the bottle and turned into the bedroom.

The moment the door closed, Isabella instinctively started to follow, but her wrist was tightly gripped by Sebastian.

"Bella, let's look at the house first." Sebastian squeezed Isabella's wrist and then put his arm around her shoulder, allowing her lean her entire weight on him.

Isabella forced herself to calm down.

Maximilian enthusiastically explained every corner of the house, "This is a hidden cabinet with a spring mechanism inside. Just press it, and the door will pop open automatically. It's very convenient. Though it may look small, it can store a lot of things. We don't usually open this cabinet. It always holds things we don't use often.

"We've left water and electricity on the balcony here. You can put a fish tank in this spot and keep a few fish."

Maximilian's introduction was very detailed. He clearly had a deep attachment to every part of the house, and Isabella could see that he was somewhat reluctant to part with it. She asked, "May I ask how long you and your wife have lived here?"

"Fifteen years," Maximilian said, a hint of nostalgia in his voice. "We bought this house when we got married, and we designed the renovation together. It's no exaggeration to say that every corner is our hard work. Actually, if you're interested, you're welcome to keep the furniture. We bought all the old brands back then, but the materials we used for the renovation were the best. I'm sure you can see that although the house is old, it's been well-maintained."

Isabella nodded and then asked, "It is evident that you and your wife are both quite nostalgic. May I ask why you want to sell this house?"

"Well." Maximilian hesitated, but thinking that since they were in a hurry to sell the house and that the young couple in front of them were potential buyers, it was reasonable for them to ask. After a moment of hesitation, he said, "We're planning to move."

Isabella was shocked. "Move?"

Maximilian glanced towards the bedroom."To be precise, we want to move to another city."

Isabella's heart skipped a beat. "You're leaving?"

It was obvious. Maximilian and Mira's intention to move meant they wanted to take Sweetie with them. They wanted to leave this city and hide far away, so no one would fight them for the child!

But the child wasn't biologically theirs, and they had agreed with the police to wait for the paternity test results. 'Are Maximilian and Mira planning to secretly sell the house and leave?' Isabella wondered.

If Sebastian hadn't found out Maximilian and Mira's address early on, if they were still waiting foolishly at the police station for the test results, would they come back in a few days to find Maximilian and Mira gone?

Isabella didn't even dare to think about it. When she came to pick up Sweetie with the paternity test report, would she go mad if she faced an empty house with new owners?

Isabella's emotions were almost at a breaking point. She stared at Maximilian, barely contained anger.

Maximilian was stunned. Just as he was about to say something, the baby's cries came from the bedroom again. And this time, the cries were even more gut-wrenching.

The cries tore at Isabella's heart, and she bit her lip hard to hold back the tears.

Mira was clearly struggling to soothe the baby. Maximilian, losing interest in the house tour, turned towards the bedroom.

Maximilian asked, "What's wrong?"

Mira said, "I don't know. Abby won't take her milk and just keeps crying. I've tried everything"

"Let me see." Maximilian carefully took the baby and soothed her, "Shh, shh, Abby. Daddy's here."

But his efforts were in vain. The baby's cries continued unabated.

The baby's cries were growing hoarse, her tiny face screwed up in distress.

At this moment, the bedroom door opened, and Isabella peered in. "Is the baby sick?"

Maximilian and Mira exchanged a glance, and Mira still remained wary. "She's fine. She's not sick."

Maximilian also said, "She doesn't have a fever, and she's usually perfectly healthy. Sometimes she just cries like this. The clinic said it's normal for babies. It's nothing serious."

Isabella said, "Such a small baby, even if she's uncomfortable, can she tell you? As parents, how can you be so careless? If the baby is sick, you should take her to the hospital, not just a clinic. Are you really the baby's biological parents?"

Sebastian said, "It's better to go to the hospital. We need to go there anyway, so we can take you along."

Maximilian was about to refuse, but Sebastian added, "We can also discuss the house on the way."

They were in a hurry to sell the house, but because it was an old neighborhood, it was difficult to sell quickly. For them, if they could close the deal today, it would be the best.

After discussing it, Maximilian and Mira decided to take the baby to the hospital.

Mira always held the baby, with the blanket almost covering half of the baby's face, leaving only the nose and mouth exposed.

In the car, the baby still cried from time to time.

Isabella couldn't help but ask, "Can I hold her?"

Mira immediately held the baby tighter. "No way!"

Isabella had to give up.

At the hospital, the doctor initially said it was colic. After a detailed examination, they found it was intussusception.

"What is intussusception?" Mira was completely confused. She had never given birth before and had never heard of the term.

Maximilian was equally clueless.

The doctor gave a brief explanation and then said hospitalization was needed.

Maximilian and Mira agreed. Maximilian immediately went to handle the admission procedures, while Isabella and Sebastian accompanied Mira to the pediatric ward.

After registering at the nurse's station, the nurse led Mira to the ward. Isabella and Sebastian quickly followed.

As they passed a certain ward, the sound of a baby crying suddenly came from inside.

Isabella's steps halted abruptly. But when she turned to look, the ward door was already closed, and the crying had stopped.

Noticing her unusual behavior, Sebastian asked, "What's wrong?"

Isabella shook her head. "Nothing."

She didn't know why, but the crying just now made her more anxious than the cries of the baby in Mira's arms.

###chapter 298 Snatching the Child

The feeling of panic lingered in Isabella's heart, making her chest feel heavy and uncomfortable.

Isabella felt a bit better after Sebastian opened the window once they were inside the hospital room.

In the room next door, Vanessa was holding Sweetie and leaning against the door, her face pale.

Vanessa's mind was in a mess. Who had she just see? It was Isabella and Sebastian! Had they came to Emerald Isle City? Why did they show up here? Could it be that they had known Sweetie was with her?

"Vanessa." A man walked out of the bathroom, holding a freshly washed baby bottle. Seeing Vanessa's current expression and posture, he was startled and quickly put down the bottle to walk over. "Why are you covering the baby's mouth?"

As he spoke, he took Sweetie from her arms. Sweetie started crying loudly again.

Vanessa seemed to be triggered by something, hurriedly reaching out to cover Sweetie's mouth. "Stop crying!"

"What are you doing?" Peter Prescott was shocked by her behavior. He avoided her hand, protectively cradling Sweetie in his arms."Are you crazy? The baby is so small; if you cover her like that, she'll suffocate!"

Peter took Sweetie to the window and gently soothed her, preventing Vanessa from covering her again.

Perhaps feeling safe, Sweetie gradually stopped crying and fell asleep in Peter's arms.

The room fell silent. When Peter looked at Sweetie's peaceful sleeping face, a fatherly smile appeared on his face. He gently kissed Sweetie's forehead and then noticed Vanessa sitting there, making a phone call.

"The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."

"The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable."

The cold, robotic female voice echoed from the phone's speaker. Vanessa hung up and dialed again. She seemed determined to get through, continuously dialing.

Peter couldn't stand it anymore and took the phone from her. "Vanessa, are you calling that godmother of yours again?"

Peter was Vanessa's current husband. He was an honest and straightforward man, working at a small company.

They got married through a blind date. Peter always knew Vanessa had something on her mind, but she never talked about it, so he never asked. He could only guess that her past had been filled with pain.

They had a flash marriage, without even holding a wedding, just a simple registration. Peter was an orphan with no parents or siblings. Vanessa had parents, but for some reason, she never introduced Peter to them.

Peter wasn't in a hurry. He liked Vanessa and was willing to wait until she was ready to open up to him.

In the later stages of Vanessa's pregnancy, she often talked on the phone with a woman.

Peter had caught her a few times, and Vanessa said it was her godmother.

When Vanessa gave birth, Emma visited once, wearing a mask. She gave Peter a bank card, asking him to take good care of Vanessa and buy her some nutritious food.

With Vanessa's consent, Peter checked the bank account and found it had a whole million dollars.

This startled Peter. A million dollars was a huge sum for ordinary people like them.

Vanessa told Peter that her godmother, Emma, was from a wealthy family, and this amount was nothing to her. It was just a token of her goodwill, and Peter should accept it with peace of mind.

At first, Peter didn't touch the money, mainly fearing that Emma might change her mind and ask for it back someday. However, later on, due to Sweetie's significant expenses, as time went by, Emma never showed any intention of asking for it back. Besides, she frequently called Vanessa, often inquiring about Sweetie's well-being. It seemed that Emma was quite dependable and truly cared for Vanessa. Then, Peter felt reassured.

But just half a month ago, Vanessa secretly bought plane tickets, intending to take Sweetie away. Fortunately, Peter discovered it and stopped her.

Upon questioning, Vanessa said it was Emma's arrangement, asking her to take Sweetie away. From then on, Peter's goodwill towards Emma vanished, replaced only by vigilance.

Especially a few nights ago, Vanessa was even on the phone with Emma in the middle of the night. Peter didn't hear the details, but since that night, Vanessa had been acting strangely. She had been acting erratically for a while, unable even to take proper care of Sweetie, who ended up with a high fever for several days and had to be hospitalized.

Seeing her call Emma again filled Peter with a deep sense of unease.

Vanessa didn't answer his question, reaching out to grab the phone. "Give me the phone!"

Peter hesitated but eventually handed it back to her.

Vanessa continued to call, but it went straight to voicemail every time.

Gradually, she stopped calling, sitting on the bed with a blank stare. "Something's wrong; something must have happened!"

Vanessa thought,' Isabella and Sebastian came to Emerald Isle City; they must be here for Sweetie. Now Emma's phone is unreachable; something must have happened!'

Vanessa searched online, finding only news from a few days ago about Charles being arrested, nothing else.

Peter placed Sweetie on the hospital bed. "I'm going to get some hot water; I'll be right back. Vanessa, watch the baby."

Vanessa nodded.

Her gaze fell on Sweetie's sleeping face. A glint of madness flickered in her eyes.

In the next room, Mira's arms were numb from holding the baby for so long. Maximilian had gone to handle the hospital admission and hadn't returned yet.

Seeing Mira exhausted, Isabella stood up and walked over. "Let me hold her for a while?"

Perhaps it was the hospital setting that lowered her guard; Mira hesitated briefly before handing the child to Isabella.

Sebastian also walked over.

The moment Isabella took the baby, her heart almost broke. To reassure Mira, she sat down by the bed, feeling the warmth of the baby in her arms, her eyes welling up with tears.

At that moment, the baby stretched out her little fist, waving it in the air. As she moved, the blanket covering her eyes slipped off, revealing her small face.

"Sweetie." Sebastian's voice was low, filled with uncontrollable excitement and elation.

But Isabella's face froze when she saw the baby's face. She immediately turned to Sebastian and firmly said, "It's not Sweetie!"

Sebastian was stunned. Before he could ask, the door was forcefully pushed open, and Maximilian ran in, out of breath. Seeing the baby, he rushed forward to take her.

Jack's eyes turned cold, and he blocked Maximilian in time.

"Give me the baby!" Maximilian shouted.

Mira was frightened by Maximilian's reaction. She held onto his arm, still confused, and asked, "What's going on? What's wrong with you?"

Maximilian pointed at Isabella and Sebastian, his expression furious. "You're not here to buy a house! You're from Lakina, aren't you? You're here to take the baby, aren't you?"

Mira's legs started to go weak upon hearing this.

###chapter 299  Doesn't Look Like This

"Give me back my child!" Mira snapped back to reality and charged forward desperately, trying to snatch her child back.

"Your child?" Sebastian spoke coldly, his stern face filled with icy disdain as his sharp gaze swept over Maximilian and Mira. "Is this your child?"

Mira was stunned, at a loss for words.

Maximilian gritted his teeth. "Even if Abby is really your child, you have to wait for the test results. You can't just lie and try to take the child away like this."

Sebastian snorted coldly. "Are you really waiting for the test results, or are you just stalling for time until you sell the house and disappear?"

With Jack blocking them, Maximilian and Mira couldn't do anything. They could only watch helplessly as Isabella held Abby.

During the commotion, Isabella remained silent. She kept her head down, looking at Abby in her arms.

Abby had woken up by now, her sleepy eyes looking at Isabella.

"Sebastian," she called out, her voice trembling.

Sebastian held her shoulders. "Bella, if you want to take our daughter back right now, I can handle it. Just say the word, and I'll take care of everything." He could either follow the rules meticulously or break them entirely; as long as Isabella desired, he would do anything. As for the consequences, he would bear them all alone.

Isabella shook her head. When she looked up again, her eyes were filled with tears. "This isn't right."

Sebastian and Jack were both taken aback. "What do you mean?"

Isabella said, "This child is not our daughter."

The room fellÂ silent.

Sebastian frowned deeply and after a long pause, asked, "Are you sure?"

"I'm sure," Isabella said, "I know my daughter. She doesn't look like this."

Jack hesitated and said, "A child changes every day. It's been so many days. Maybe she's changed a lot."

Isabella said nothing more. Indeed, Jack had a point. Even though Isabella was almost certain this wasn't her Sweetie, she couldn't rule out the remaining possibility until the test results came back.

Isabella handed the child back to Mira.

For the next three days, Sebastian had people watching the Montgomery residence and the hospital around the clock.

There was no way they would let them leave before the test results came out.

Three days later, the results were in. The child from the Montgomery family was indeed not Isabella and Sebastian's daughter, Sweetie.

"How could this be?" Jack frowned deeply. He couldn't believe it when he saw the results.

"Investigate," Sebastian said, clutching the test results. "Start with this girl. I can't believe we won't find anything!"

The investigation into the girl adopted by the Montgomery family led them to an orphanage.

According to the director, a woman had abandoned the child a few months ago. She'd left her at the orphanage's doorstep in the middle of the night and disappeared.

The surveillance footage at the orphanage was blurry, capturing only a blurry figure, and the trail went cold.

"Mr. Landon," Jack hesitated, "could it be that Emerald Isle City is just a red herring, and the child isn't here at all?"

Considering Emma's madness, it was a strong possibility.

Sebastian rubbed his temples, his voice hoarse. "Keep investigating."

Jack could only nod.

Isabella hadn't been sleeping well these past few days. She always felt depressive. Without finding Sweetie, she couldn't eat, and she was visibly wasting away.

At noon, Jack arranged for some local delicacies from Emerald Isle City, but Isabella still had no appetite.

Sebastian was heartbroken. "Bella, should I take you to see a doctor?"

Isabella refused. "I'm fine."

She pointed to her heart. "It feels so heavy, like I can't breathe."

"What's going on?" Sebastian sat down beside her, wrapping his arm around her waist and placing his large hand gently on her chest, massaging softly. "I've never seen you like this before."

"Yeah, it started that day at the hospital," Isabella said.

She suddenly grabbed Sebastian's hand. "Sebastian, I think I heard Sweetie crying."

"Bella," Sebastian patted her back, "you're hallucinating."

They were in a hotel, staying in a luxury suite. There was no way they could hear any noise, let alone a child's cry.

Isabella shook her head vigorously. "I'm not talking about now. I mean that day, at the hospital, I think I heard Sweetie crying! Yes, it was Sweetie crying!"

She stood up abruptly, her chaotic thoughts suddenly snapping into focus. "I knew there was a reason why that cry made my chest feel so heavy. It was Sweetie. Sweetie must have been in that hospital! Sebastian, how could I have been so stupid? I should have realized it then!"

Sebastian got excited too. He gripped Isabella's hand tightly. "Let's go to the hospital right now. We still have time!"

The pediatric ward of the hospital was heavily guarded.

When they opened the room from that day, they found a completely unfamiliar child and their parents inside.

Jack went to the nurse's station to retrieve the admission records from three days ago. "Three days ago, a six-month-old baby girl named Penelope Prescott was in this room. Her guardian's name is Peter."

"Find this Peter!" Sebastian ordered, "Immediately!"

By evening, Peter was on his way home from work. As he reached his front door, several men in suits blocked his path.

Peter dropped the bag he was carrying. "Who are you?"

Jack stepped out from the shadows. "Peter, right?"

Peter nodded. "Yes."

Jack asked, "Is your daughter named Penelope?"

Peter replied, "Yes."

Jack asked, "Where is she now?"

Seeing Peter remain silent, Jack signaled his men, who searched Peter and found his keys, then opened his door.

"What are you doing?" Peter's eyes widened as he tried to stop them. "This is trespassing; I can press charges against you!"

Jack held him back, speaking calmly, "Trespassing is nothing compared to child trafficking."

Peter was stunned. "What child trafficking?"

At that moment, several police officers arrived. "Who's Peter? Come with us."

Isabella and Sebastian waited in the car downstairs. They watched as the police led Peter out of the building, but there was no sign of Sweetie.

After a while, Jack approached. "Mr. Landon, we searched the place. The child isn't there. There aren't even any photos of a child in the house. "

Jack paused and took out his phone, opening the photo gallery. "But I found this."

It was a recently taken wedding photo:a man and a woman in a suit and wedding dress. The man was Peter, and the woman was Vanessa.

When Isabella saw the face clearly, her expression changed dramatically. "Vanessa!"

###chapter 300  It's Sweetie

"Vanessa?" Isabella's heart skipped a beat when she saw that face, and it was as if a thread in her mind connected all her doubts together.

"So Emma sent the child to Emerald Isle City because Vanessa is here. Emma handed Sweetie over to Vanessa?" Isabella broke out in a cold sweat. She would rather Sweetie be with the Maximilian family than with Vanessa.

At least Maximilian and Mira genuinely cared for the child, but Vanessa? Given their past conflicts, Isabella couldn't imagine what Vanessa was thinking while holding Sweetie.

Meanwhile, at the Police Station...

The police were taking Peter's statement. "Peter, where's your wife?" the police asked.

Peter's eyes flickered, and he replied, "I don't know."

The police said, "You don't know? You're her husband, how could you not know?"

Peter replied, "I really don't know. Three days ago, we were at the hospital with the child. I went to fetch some hot water, and when I returned, she and the child were gone. I've been trying to contact her these past few days, but her phone is always off." Peter nervously rubbed his fingers, looking uneasy. "Could something have happened to her and the child?"

Vanessa and Sweetie had been missing for three days, and now the police were involved. It was hard to think positively.

The police asked, "No. We're just looking for her. Is your daughter's name Penelope Prescott?"

Vanessa said, "Yes."

The police asked again, "Is she your biological daughter?"

Peter was taken aback, then lowered his eyes and nervously rubbed his fingers. "I can't lie to you. Penelope is not my biological child. Vanessa was already pregnant before we got married. She said the child's father did something wrong and is no longer in this world. She didn't want to abort the child; she wanted to give birth and find a father for the child, to give her a complete family. I had my doubts, but her determination won me over. Later, we got married."

The police nodded, taking detailed notes of his words, then asked, "Do you have any photos of the child on your phone?"

"Yes, I do." Peter took out his phone and opened the photo album.

His album contained only three photos, all of Sweetie.

The police glanced at the photos, then got up and opened the doo. They handed the phone to Isabella and Sebastian, who were sitting outside.

The child in the photo was smiling, and Isabella recognized her immediately. "It's Sweetie!"

"Are you sure it's Sweetie?" Sebastian asked.

"Yes, I'm sure." Isabella's eyes welled up with tears. "I know my daughter."

Even though it had been months, Isabella still recognized her daughter Stella in the photo instantly.

Sebastian zoomed in on the photo, his gaze lingering on Sweetie with a tenderness that made him reluctant to even blink.

After Peter finished his statement and came out, Sebastian frowned, handed the phone back to Peter, and said coldly, "Send me my daughter's original photos."

"My daughter?" Peter was confused. "Didn't Vanessa say the child's father was dead?"

Sebastian frowned disdainfully, putting an arm around Isabella's shoulder. "I'm the child's father, and this is the child's mother. You believe Vanessa?"

Although Peter was confused, under the police's urging, he had no choice but to comply with Sebastian's request and send all the photos to Sebastian's phone.

Sebastian saved the original photos and looked at Peter with displeasure. "My daughter's photos can't stay on a stranger's phone. Delete them!"

Peter thought, 'Isn't this a bit much?' After all, he took the photos.

But before Peter could refuse, Sebastian had already taken the phone and deleted all the photos.

A police officer came over and said, "Mr. Prescott, if you manage to contact Vanessa, please let us know. We need her cooperation for an investigation regarding the child."

Peter was still confused, unable to make sense of the situation, but he nodded cooperatively. "Okay."

Then Peter left the police station and took a cab home.

Sebastian told Jack, "Have someone keep an eye on him."

Jack nodded. "Yes."

Isabella felt uneasy. "Will keeping an eye on him help? It seems Vanessa only sought him out to find a father for the child. If Vanessa is really hiding, she might not contact him."

"She will," Sebastian said confidently, "Vanessa has no one to rely on in Emerald Isle City. Peter is the only one who can help her. If Vanessa runs into trouble, she'll definitely reach out to him!"

Back at the hotel, Isabella took a shower. When she came out, she saw Sebastian standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, head down, eyes fixed on his phone screen, completely absorbed. He didn't even notice her approaching.

Isabella peeked over and saw that he was looking at Sweetie's photos.

"This is my daughter." Sebastian's finger gently caressed the screen, his eyes full of tenderness.

"Yes." Isabella leaned against him, also touching the screen. "Our daughter is really pretty."

Sebastian turned slightly to look at her. "She looks just like you."

Isabella smiled. "I think she looks like you."

Sebastian lowered his head and kissed her forehead. "Thank you, Bella."

Isabella looked up at him. "Thank me for what?"

"Thank you for coming into my life and for giving me such a lovely daughter," Sebastian said, turning to embrace Isabella. "Bella, with you and Sweetie, I'll never be alone again."

Isabella hugged him tightly. "Sebastian, you'll never be alone again. Sweetie and I will always be with you."

"Yes." Sebastian smiled, but a flicker of pain crossed his eyes.

Peter returned home, unable to focus on anything.

He called Vanessa dozens of times, but her phone was still off.

Tired of calling, he sat on the couch, staring blankly. He sat there until it got dark.

Peter got up and poured himself a glass of water. After drinking it, he continued to call Vanessa.

When the calls didn't go through, he sent messages.

Peter: [Vanessa, where are you? How is Penelope?]

Peter: [This afternoon, some police officers and a young couple came to our home. They said they are Penelope's biological parents. What's going on?]

Peter: [Vanessa, please call me back or send a text. I'm really worried about you two.]

Message after message went unanswered.

Meanwhile, on a cruise ship heading to Lakina, passengers were boarding. Vanessa, who was holding Sweetie, was among the crowd.

###chapter 301 I'm leaving

As Emma's phone couldn't be reached, Vanessa didn't know if something had happened to the Landon family or if Emma intended to leave this matter to her. Either way, she had to go to Lakina.

Now that Sebastian and Isabella had found their way here, she absolutely couldn't sit idly by. Vanessa needed Emma to arrange for her and Sweetie to leave, preferably to go abroad. Once they were out of the country, Isabella and Sebastian would never find their child Sweetie again!

As long as Vanessa boarded the cruise ship, she could smoothly get to Lakina. Once in Lakina, meeting Emma would mean she had nothing to worry about.

But just as Vanessa was about to go through security, the items in her backpack suddenly started to stir, and faint sounds could be heard through the thick canvas.

Vanessa nervously took off her backpack, held it in her arms, and walked quickly inside.

The security officer reached out to stop her. "Please pass your bag through the scanner again."

Vanessa shook her head. "There's nothing in my bag, just some daily necessities. Can I skip the security check?"

The security officer said, "It's the rule. You just need to put the bag on the scanner, and the machine will automatically identify it."

The security officer led Vanessa over. "Please give me your bag."

The stuff in the bag were moving more vigorously.

Vanessa's face turned slightly pale. After a moment of hesitation, she suddenly said, "I'm not boarding the ship."

Then, under the puzzled gaze of the security officer, Vanessa turned to leave, quickly disappearing into the crowd.

In the restroom, Vanessa unzipped the backpack and took out Sweetie.

Sweetie's mouth was taped shut, and she could only breathe through her nose. Having been in the backpack for a long time, her breathing was somewhat labored, and her little nose was red from being squeezed. When Sweetie was taken out, she struggled with all her limbs, crying and trembling all over. Since her mouth was blocked and she couldn't cry out loud, her little face turned somewhat purple from holding back her cries.

"If it weren't for you, I'd be on that ship by now. How dare you cry?" Vanessa vented all her anger on the young Sweetie, pinching her hard several times.

Sweetie shivered, her cries intensifying, her breathing rapid, and her little face turning an even deeper shade of purple.

Vanessa gritted her teeth and threatened, "If you dare cry again, I'll throw you into the sea to feed the sharks!"

The young Sweetie couldn't understand her words. She was driven by her body's instincts and she kept crying.

"Stop crying! Stop it!" Vanessa hissed, pinching Sweetie repeatedly. "I told you to stop crying, didn't you hear me?"

Just then, someone knocked on the stall door from outside and asked, "Lady, do you need help?"

Vanessa quickly covered Sweetie's mouth and nose. "No need."

Sweetie's cries came out intermittently, and the person outside was still worried. "Are you sure you don't need help? Your child sounds like she is crying very hard."

Afraid of arousing suspicion if she stayed any longer, Vanessa simply tore off the tape from Sweetie's mouth and opened the stall door to leave.

Several women were standing outside. When they saw her come out, they all stepped aside, looking at Vanessa with strange expressions.

"My child is sick. That's why she's crying," Vanessa explained, then hurriedly left with Sweetie in her arms.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

During these three days, Peter commuted between his company and home every day, with no abnormalities.

During the day, he worked in a daze at the company, and at night, he returned to the cold and empty home. If it weren't for the wedding photo of him and Vanessa on the wall and Vanessa and Sweetie's apparel in the closet, Peter would have thought that everything he had experienced recently was just a dream.

After dinner, Peter went to bed early.

In the middle of the night, an urgent phone ring woke him up.

At first, Peter thought he was dreaming. The phone rang for half a minute before he suddenly woke up, turned on the bedside lamp, and grabbed his phone.

The name "Vanessa" flashing on the screen made him ecstatic. He hurriedly pressed the answer button. "Hello, Vanessa, you finally called me! Where are you now? How's the baby?"

There was a few seconds of silence on the other end, then Vanessa's voice came through, "Peter, will you help me?"

Peter gripped the phone tightly. "Tell me."

Vanessa said, "I'm in the underground parking lot right now. Bring me some cash. I need twenty thousand dollars!"

Peter was stunned. "Don't you still have money in your account?"

The money Emma had given her still had hundreds of thousands of dollars left. Vanessa couldn't have spent it all in such a short time.

Vanessa lowered her voice. "I can't use my card or phone right now. I need cash!"

"Why?" Peter felt uneasy. "Vanessa, what are you afraid of? Could it be true what they said, that the baby was stolen by you?"

"Stop bothering!" Vanessa grew impatient. "I'll give you ten minutes. Bring the money over in ten minutes!"

With that, Vanessa hung up the phone.

Peter didn't delay. He put on a coat and went out.

There was an ATM outside the community. Peter withdrew the money, looked around, and took the elevator to the second basement level of the parking lot.

The garage was silent and empty in the middle of the night. Peter's footsteps echoed hollowly in the vast, empty space. As he walked to a corridor door, he saw a figure flash by.

"Vanessa?" Peter called out in a low voice, but there was no response.

Peter hesitated for a moment, then walked over.

As soon as he reached the corridor door, a hand pulled him inside.

Peter looked closely and showed joy. "Vanessa!"

Vanessa was in no mood for conversation, only asking, "Where's the money?"

Peter handed her the money bag. Vanessa took it, unzipped it, and glanced inside.

Peter asked, "Where have you been these past few days? Why didn't you call me? Did you see the messages I sent you? Where's the baby?"

"Are you done?" Vanessa interrupted him, zipping up the bag. "Thanks."

With that, she turned to leave.

Peter grabbed her arm. "Vanessa."

Vanessa turned back, her brows furrowed, always warily looking around. "What else?"

Peter asked, "Vanessa, is that child really yours?"

Peter was an honest man. From dating Vanessa to marrying her, he always listened to her. Whatever Vanessa said, he never questioned it and always followed her wishes.

This was the first time he'd ever doubted her.

Vanessa shook off his hand. "Of course, it's my child!"

Peter paused, then said, "Vanessa, I believe you."

Vanessa was slightly stunned when she heard this. She looked at Peter and said, "Peter,I'm leaving."

Peter seemed unfazed by the revelation, his voice calm as he asked, "Where to?"

Vanessa suddenly felt a bit uncomfortable. "Peter, let's get a divorce."

###chapter 302 Unworthy

Peter was stunned.

Vanessa said, "I only married you to give my child a father. You know, I never had any feelings for someone like you. But now I'm leaving, so our marriage is null and void."

Peter pressed his lips together, remaining silent.

Vanessa said, "I'll be gone for a while. If you meet someone suitable, go ahead and start dating. Once I'm settled, I'll come back to finalize the divorce."

A car approached, and Vanessa pulled down the brim of her hat, turning to leave.

"Vanessa." Peter grabbed her."I'll wait for you."

Vanessa was speechless.

"I'll wait for you to come back." Peter smiled. "I'll wait for you and Penelope, no matter how long it takes."

Vanessa rolled her eyes and coldly shook off his hand. "Suit yourself."

Vanessa lowered her head and quickly walked towards the exit, leaving Peter standing there, watching her.

Just as Vanessa was about to reach the exit, several figures suddenly rushed over and surrounded Vanessa.

Vanessa didn't even have a chance to escape and was caught.

"Vanessa!" Peter shouted, running over, but was stopped by someone.

When a black car pulled up, Sebastian and Isabella got out.

"Vanessa," Isabella spoke, "where is my daughter?"

Vanessa said, "What daughter? I don't understand what you're talking about."

"Vanessa!" Isabella gritted her teeth. She had never hated anyone in her life, but Vanessa was the exception. "Give me back my child!"

Vanessa sneered at Isabella's face. "I told you, I don't know what you're talking about!"

Isabella wanted to rush over and slap her, when a police car arrived. Sebastian held Isabella back and said to Vanessa, "Vanessa, before the police come, you still have a choice. We just want the child to be safe."

Vanessa looked at him and smiled. "Mr. Landon, you haven't changed much. Although I left Lakina, I've been keeping an eye on you. It must have been tough for you recently, Mr. Landon?"

The obsession in Vanessa's eyes was unmistakable.

Â "Mr. Landon, you chose Isabella and went against the Landon family, causing yourself so much trouble. Have you ever regretted it?" Vanessa asked.

Sebastian frowned, tightening his grip on Isabella's shoulder. "It's been a bit tough, but as long as Bella is by my side, I can handle anything."

Vanessa was stung by his words, a hint of jealousy in her eyes. "Sebastian, what does Isabella have that I don't? I worked so hard for you at the Landon Group. Why couldn't you see that? I'm willing to do anything for you. Can Isabella do that?"

Sebastian looked at her, his eyes calm. "Anything?"

"Yes," Vanessa said firmly.

Sebastian said, "Then tell me where my daughter is."

"What?" Seb's voice was ice-cold. "Can't do it?"

Vanessa shook her head. "That child is Isabella's, a product of her reckless behavior. She shouldn't even exist! But Sebastian, I can give you children too. A boy, a girl-as many as you want."

At that moment, Peter looked at Vanessa, feeling like she was a stranger.

The Vanessa who was always so indifferent and goddess-like in front of him was now so humble and self-degrading. And it was all for another man. His past efforts and affection now seemed pathetic and laughable.

Sebastian sneered. "In your eyes, having a man's child is an expression of love? Then what about the child you had with Charlie?"

Vanessa's face changed. "I don't like Charlie; I hate him! I had his child just to disgust Nina and Isabella."

Isabella shook her head. "But it seems you didn't disgust us, you only disgusted yourself."

She paused, glancing behind Vanessa. "And your husband."

Vanessa was stunned. She instinctively turned around and met Peter's gaze. Peter's expression was complex, filled with mixed emotions. He only looked at Vanessa for two seconds before lowering his head, not looking at her again.

Then, Vanessa turned away from Peter, her voice cold. "He's not my husband! When I first arrived in Emerald Isle City, I just wanted to find a man quickly and settle down. After a few blind dates, those men all ran away when they heard I was pregnant. Only this fool professed that he was touched by me and wished to marry me, assuming the role of the father to my child. Who cares?"

These words from Vanessa's mouth were unfazed by the revelation for Isabella and Sebastian. But for Peter, the hurt was devastating.

Peter's tall figure stood there, stiff.

Isabella couldn't use normal reasoning to explain Vanessa anymore. "Vanessa, after you left Lakina, you could have lived a good life. You met a man willing to accept you and your child, a man who was all about you, but you didn't cherish it. Instead, you harbored hatred and sought revenge. You don't deserve it."

Vanessa said, "I don't deserve it, but do you, Isabella? You're just a low-born person. If it weren't for that night with Sebastian, could you have become Mrs. Landon?" Talking about the past, Vanessa was still resentful. "I did make a mistake. My mistake was not finding a chance to get into Sebastian's tent like you did!"

Ever since then, Vanessa had regretted it. If she had known, she would have found a way to sleep with Sebastian.

Vanessa was a few years older than Isabella and had joined the Landon Group earlier. She had been focused on excelling at work. Vanessa was convinced that if she had slept with Sebastian earlier, there would have been no room for Isabella in his life.

Isabella was speechless. She realized she couldn't communicate with Vanessa anymore.

Sebastian looked down at Isabella, squeezed her shoulder, signaling that he would handle it.

He said to Vanessa, "You don't seriously believe my relationship with Isabella is just because of that one night, do you?"

"Isn't it?" Vanessa retorted with a sneer. "Mr. Landon, when you mistook me for her, didn't you want to take responsibility for me? Just because I wasn't the one from that night, you discarded me. Mr. Landon, do you know how much I love you? You are so cruel."

Sebastian was silent for two seconds and asked, "Since you say that, let me ask you; after I mistook you for Isabella , I indeed said I would take responsibility, but did I ever touch you?"

###chapter 303 Simply Suffocating

That indeed did not happen.

That indeed did not happen. Even when Vanessa tried her best to seduce Sebastian, he gently pushed her away.

Sebastian sharply pointed out the key issue, "As you said, if it was because of that night, why didn't I touch you in the mistaken situation? Vanessa, do you really think that men are creatures who can't control their sexual desires?"

Sebastian said, "I developed feelings for Isabella over time. Even without knowing she was the one from that night, I already liked her. During this period, you've been taking her place.'

Sebastian continued, "Vanessa, a man's feelings for a woman are not just physical, but more psychological. If you don't understand that, then I can only say you don't even know what love is."

Vanessa's expression changed dramatically, and she became somewhat emotional, 'I know, of course I know. Love is being willing to do anything for that person! Mr. Landon, even if you asked me to die for you now, I would do it willingly. Isn't that love?'

"That is certainly not love!" Sebastian said calmly.

Vanessa was stunned.

Sebastian said, "That's obsession. To put it bluntly, it's a kind of sickness!

"Love isn't about dying for someone; it's about fulfillment, consideration, and respect. Vanessa, if I were Peter, would you still have this obsession with me?

"I have looked into your family and asked Laura. Laura said you have never been in a relationship, and your biggest ambition is to make a name for yourself. Initially, you wanted to achieve this through your own efforts, which is why you worked so hard after joining the company, trying to make a mark. But you gradually realized that society is harsher than you thought, and making a name for yourself is too difficult. So you changed your mind. You told Laura you wanted to marry into a wealthy family. Find a rich and excellent man to marry and have children with, so no one would look down on you anymore.

"Zaire said you once tried to seduce him, but he rejected you. Thereafter, the episode involving Isabella and me unfolded, and for you, it fortuitously presented a pivotal opportunity. You astutely capitalized on Isabella's fragile disposition, cognizant of her overbearing sense of morality, thus impersonating her, making her withdraw willingly.

"Your plan would have been perfect, if I hadn't fallen for Isabella.

"So, from the beginning to the end, you never loved me. You were just looking for a shortcut to success, and I was that shortcut. You could have continued down this shortcut, but because of Bella, your dream was shattered. Vanessa, you don't love anyone. You only love yourself!"

The final word hit like a hammer, shattering Vanessa's composure. She shook her head frantically. "No, it's not like that, it's not like that!"

"Vanessa!" Suddenly, a voice came from the side.

The voice jolted Vanessa like an electric shock. She turned her head to see a middle-aged woman walking quickly towards her, and she slapped Vanessa in the face.

Vanessa's head tilted from the slap, and before she could react, she was met with a flurry of punches and kicks.

Athena Sullivan, while hitting her, kept scolding, 'You shameless bitch, who told you to do such shameless things? Shameless, disgraceful!'

Vanessa held her head, whimpering, "Don't hit me. Don't hit me anymore!"

"Not hit you? You did such disgraceful things, and I shouldn't hit you? What else should I do with you?"Athena grew increasingly furious as she spoke, the force in her hands intensifying with each blow, a few of which struck Vanessa's head with alarming severity.

Strangely, Vanessa, who was usually so strong-willed, willingly took the beating, not even fighting back. Beaten down, she slowly crouched, merely clutching her head in a manner that belied her usual strength.

Athena's beating became more intense. She even raised her foot high, about to kick Vanessa.

"Enough!" Peter rushed out in time and pulled Athena away.

He took off his coat and draped it over Vanessa. "What gives you the right to hit her?"

"What gives me the right?" Athena steadied herself, glaring with a face full of malice. "She's my flesh and blood! I gave her life, and I can take it away. She'll do as I say, or else!"

Peter was stunned. "You are Vanessa's mother?"

Athena spat harshly, hands on her hips. "I wish I had never given birth to such a disgusting bitch. Disgusting!"

Peter was momentarily speechless.

Even Isabella showed a look of disbelief. She had never seen a mother like Athena, so harsh and vicious to her own child, with every word dripping with deep-seated insult. A mother like Athena was suffocating!

As the police prepared to take Vanessa away, her hat had already been slapped to the ground by Athena, leaving her hair disheveled and unkempt. In front of Athena, Vanessa cowered, not even daring to make eye contact.

Seeing Vanessa about to be taken to the police car, Isabella stepped forward. 'Vanessa.'

Vanessa stopped and looked back at her.

Â "Vanessa, where is my daughter?Please return her to me. I really miss her." Isabella looked at Vanessa with tearful eyes, willing to set aside her hatred for a moment for Sweetie.

Vanessa pressed her lips tightly, not answering.

Seeing this, Sebastian signaled to Athena.

Athena immediately stepped forward, grabbing Vanessa's hair and yanking it back hard.

Vanessa screamed, instinctively covering her head with her hands.

Athena showed no mercy, pulling even harder, almost tearing off a layer of Vanessa's scalp. 'I asked you, where did you hide the child?'

Vanessa gritted her teeth, remaining silent.

Seeing this, Athena became even more furious. She raised her knee and slammed it into Vanessa's lower back, shouting, "Speak!"

Peter tried to intervene but was stopped by Sebastian's men.

Vanessa, in excruciating pain, finally couldn't take it anymore and said, " She wasunder the bridge at Riverside Park."

As soon as she spoke, Athena let go.

Vanessa was taken away by the police, and Peter, as a family member, went with them.

"Sweetie was at Riverside Park." Isabella grabbed Sebastian's hand, tears welling up in her eyes.

Sebastian held Isabella's hand, comforting her. "Don't worry. We'll go there right away. Sweetie is definitely waiting for us."

"Okay."Isabella nodded withanxious expression.

As the car started, someone knocked on the window.

It was Athena standing outside. When the window rolled down, she showed a fawning smile. "Mr. Landon, I did as you asked, so..."

Sebastian glanced at Athena's greedy, ugly face and threw a check at her. "Get lost."

Athena caught the check with both hands, her eyes lighting up at the string of numbers. "Thank you, Mr. Landon. Thank you, Mr. Landon."

###chapter 304 "I'll Go"

The car window rolled up, and it slowly drove away, leaving Athena's figure receding into the distance until she gradually vanished from sight.

Isabella withdrew her gaze and grabbed Sebastian's hand. "How much did you give her?"

Sebastian was taken aback and made a gesture.

Angela asked, "Eighty thousand dollars?"

Sebastian nodded. "Yes."

Seeing Isabella's furrowed brow, Sebastian pulled her into his arms. "No one in this world is more important than you and Sweetie. Eighty thousand dollars is nothing."

Isabella nodded. Indeed, compared to Sweetie's whereabouts, money was nothing. Athena's greedy expression flashed in her mind. "How did you think of bringing Vanessa's mother over?"

Sebastian said, "When she returned to Emerald Isle City, instead of seeking the refuge of her family, she chose to hastily marry a stranger. Don't you find that peculiar? I had Jack look into it and found some clues."

Jack and his team arrived at Riverside Park first and had already found Sweetie under the bridge in the park.

When Isabella and Sebastian arrived, a crowd had already gathered. Even though a police line had been set up, it couldn't stop the curious onlookers.

"Mr. Landon, the child is under the bridge. But..." Jack's expression was grave.

Isabella's legs went weak, nearly causing her to stumble.

"But what?" Sebastian's voice grew heavy, his clenched fingers tightening so fiercely that his knuckles turned pale.

Jack quickly said, "The child is fine; she just cried a couple of times. But..."

Sebastian said, "Jack, if you say 'but' one more time, I'll throw you into the river," Sebastian snapped. He hated it most when people beat around the bush, especially at such a critical moment. Jack was driving him and Isabella to the brink.

Without waiting for Jack to continue, Sebastian took Isabella's hand and walked towards the bridge.

As they neared the bridge, the sound of several dog barks cut through the murmuring crowd.

The surrounding onlookers were chattering.

"Who would leave a baby under a bridge like this?"

"Poor little thing, it's freezing out here. How could anyone do this? It's just cruel!"

"What is that big black dog trying to do?"

Suddenly, the crowd gasped in unison, and some even covered their eyes, not daring to look.

A gunshot rang out. When Isabella and Sebastian pushed through the crowd, they saw the scene under the bridge. Isabella nearly fainted.

In the corner under the bridge, a tiny bundle lay nestled amongst the shadows, its little hands waving feebly. The baby's cries were faint, carried away by the wind.

Next to the bundle lay a skinny black dog, with a bloody wound on its body, blood gushing out. Nearby were five or six other stray dogs, all emaciated, tails erect, making huffing sounds, all facing the bundle.

It seemed that the stray dogs had found the hidden child and wanted to feast.

"Sweetie," Isabella called out, trying to rush over, but Sebastian held her back.

He handed Isabella to Jack. "Take care of her. I'll go."

Isabella instinctively reached out, but Sebastian moved too quickly, and she grabbed nothing.

Sebastian approached the police and had a brief conversation.

The police explained that these were stray dogs, and to protect the child, they could be shot. However, the dogs were still tense. The death of the black dog had not deterred them but made them more aggressive.

Some dogs were even hiding in blind spots, making it impossible to aim.

A policeman said, "Stray dogs can be very dangerous. We're worried that shooting might provoke other dogs, causing them to attack the child."

At this moment, a police officer brought over a basket of raw meat. "There are generally two reasons why stray dogs attack people: extreme hunger or territorial instinct. We plan to use some meat to distract them and safely rescue the child first, before proceeding with containment."

A young policeman took the meat basket and was about to go down.

Sebastian took off his suit jacket and threw it aside. "I'll go!" he said.

Without another word, Sebastian took the meat basket, glanced at the bridge, and said with determination, "That's my daughter. I've already missed her birth and let her suffer too much. I can't miss this again, and I can't leave her there alone."

With that, Sebastian walked down with the meat basket.

Isabella leaned over the railing, watching Sebastian's determined steps towards the bridge. The crowd held their breath, craning their necks, eyes wide open, afraid to miss anything.

The police had their guns trained on the stray dogs under the bridge, ready to shoot at the slightest sign of trouble.

The light under the bridge was dim, and the cold wind blew through.

Sebastian's appearance immediately caught the dogs' attention. Two of the closest dogs turned towards him, baring their teeth, growling, ferociously.

Sebastian glanced at the bundle not far away, then took a piece of meat from the basket and threw it in the opposite direction.

After a few seconds, one dog turned to get the meat, tearing it apart with its sharp teeth. In no time, the meat was gone, but the dog was still hungry, licking its teeth and eyeing Sebastian's basket more fiercely.

The other dogs, drawn by the commotion, turned and slowly surrounded Sebastian.

Isabella watched, her heart pounding in her chest.

As the dogs closed in, Sebastian remained calm, taking another piece of meat and throwing it further away.

As soon as he threw it, two dogs leaped into the air, fighting over the meat before it even hit the ground.

The other dogs quickly approached Sebastian, some already in attack positions. If he didn't drop the basket soon, he would be bitten.

After a few seconds, a black and white dog suddenly leaped.

The crowd gasped, and Isabella instinctively covered her mouth.

At the critical moment, Sebastian sidestepped and threw the basket at the dog.

###chapter 305  A Family of Three

The basket of meat landed precisely on the dog, toppling over and scattering chunks of meat across the ground.

This action immediately diverted the dogs that were originally targeting Sebastian. They pounced on the meat chunks and began eating frantically.

Sebastian had clearly anticipated that. The moment he threw the basket, he turnedÂ to run under the bridge. He stepped over the dying black dog and bent down to pick up the swaddled baby.

"Sweetie." Sebastian lifted the blanket, revealing a soft, chubby little face.

As he lifted the corner of the blanket, Sweetie opened her eyes and looked at him. Her face was still streaked with tears, but she suddenly gave him a sweet smile when she saw him.

That smile filled Sebastian's heart with warmth.

Sebastian put the blanket back down, covering Sweetie's face, and then carried her, walking past the pack of dogs.

Just as everyone was breathing a sigh of relief, a dog suddenly lifted its head and lunged forward.

"Mr. Landon!"

"Mr. Landon!"

Isabella watched in horror as the dog lunged at Sebastian, its bared fangs sinking deeply into his left arm.

Another gunshot rang out, and the dog fell to the ground, rolling and twitching.

The gunshot startled the dogs that were eating, but Sebastian was already on the shore with Sweetie before they could give chase.

After finishing the meat, the dogs paced restlessly. But within minutes, they started foaming at the mouth, convulsing, and soon lay lifeless.

It turned out that the basket of raw meat was laced with poison. Even a single bite was enough to kill a dog.

Sebastian and Sweetie were taken to the hospital.

Sweetie was fine, with only some bruises, but nothing serious.

Sebastian's left arm was stitched up, and he was given a rabies shot.

Jack bought formula and diapers for Sweetie. Then Isabella prepared the formula and fed her. After eating, Sweetie fell asleep.

When Sebastian opened his eyes, he saw Isabella sitting by the bed, gently touching Sweetie's little face with her fingers.

He sat up in bed. "Let me hold her."

Sebastian reached out his hand, inadvertently tugging at the wound, causing a sharp pain that furrowed his brow and drenched him in a cold sweat.

Isabella quickly said, "The doctor said your wound is serious and you need to rest. Don't move around."

She handed Sweetie over, whispering, "She just fell asleep."

Sebastian touched Sweetie's nose with his other hand, his eyes softening. "Our Sweetie is really beautiful."

Isabella and Sebastian held Sweetie and watched her for most of the night.

They only managed a few hours of sleep before the first light of dawn crept into the room.

Morning light filtered through the curtains as Jack entered the room. He saw the three of them squeezed onto one hospital bed, with Sebastian's entire back almost hanging off the edge, about to fall, while an empty crib stood nearby.

Sebastian was usually a light sleeper, but today, he was in a deep sleep and didn't even notice Jack coming in.

Reflecting on all that had transpired recently, Jack marveled at their rare moment of peace and serenity. Unwilling to disturb them, he quietly set down the breakfast and slipped out.

Closing the door, Jack stood guard outside.

Kelsey called, asking how things were going.

Jack replied, "We found Sweetie!"

"Really? That's great," Kelsey said excitedly, "I need to start preparing something. I can't meet the baby empty-handed."

"Yeah." Jack nodded. "The baby will love whatever you prepare."

"What are you going to give?" Kelsey asked.

Jack hesitated, feeling a bit embarrassed. "I'm not good at picking gifts. Can you help me choose a few? I'll give you the money."

"Your money is my money anyway. It's too much trouble to give back and forth. I heard the peaches from Emerald Isle City are good. Can you bring some back for me?"

Jack understood that peaches could be bought anywhere; Kelsey didn't truly crave the fruit. What she cherished was the time spent affectionately with him.

Isabella and the others stayed in Emerald Isle City for two more days. After the paternity test results confirmed Sweetie's identity, Vanessa was charged with kidnapping.

Vanessa also did a paternity test, but it was with Abby, who was adopted by the Maximilian family.

As Isabella suspected, the child Maximilian adopted was indeed Vanessa's biological daughter.

The situation became clear. Emma had likely made some agreement with Vanessa. After Vanessa gave birth to Abby, she abandoned her at an orphanage, and Abby was later legally adopted by Maximilian and Mira. Meanwhile, Emma secretly gave Isabella's child, Sweetie, to Vanessa.

Although the two children were only a few months apart, their identical gender as girls aroused no suspicion.

If Emma hadn't mentioned Emerald Isle City, no one would have thought to investigate there. Even if Isabella and Sweetie met face-to-face years later, Isabella might not have recognized her own daughter.

Who would have thought that Vanessa would abandon her own child and raise her enemy's child?

Every time Isabella thought about it, she felt a chill. The bruises on Sweetie's body were evidence of Vanessa's abuse. If Sweetie were raised by her, it would have a profound impact on her character. Vanessa may destroy Sweetie bit by bit.

Thinking of this, Isabella hugged Sweetie tightly and kissed her repeatedly. Fortunately, they found Sweetie.

Sebastian hugged her from behind, his long fingers gently pinching Sweetie's cheek. "If I didn't know this was my daughter, I'd be jealous of how much you're kissing her."

Isabella turned to kiss him on the cheek.

Sebastian, feeling spoiled, turned his left cheek. "Kiss this side too."

"Equal treatment," he said matter-of-factly.

Isabella was speechless.

As they were being affectionate, there was a knock on the door.

Sebastian didn't change his position and said, "Come in."

Jack entered, followed by Maximilian and Mira, who were carrying Vanessa's daughter, Abby.Â 

As soon as they entered, Maximilian and Mira, with tearful eyes, were about to kneel before Isabella and Sebastian. "Mr. Landon, Mrs. Landon, we really love this child. Can you help us? Please don't let them take her away."

Isabella looked at Jack.

Jack explained, "It's Peter. He is now the only guardian besides Vanessa. Vanessa will be charged with abandonment and kidnapping, but as the child's father, he has the right to take her back."

###chapter 306  I'll Wait for You

As soon as Mira heard this, she immediately knelt down and started kowtowing. "Please, Mrs. Landon, help us. We've heard about the child's mother. She abandoned the child back then, so she doesn't deserve to take her back. How could someone like that truly love the child? I really like this child. As long as they're willing, we'll agree to anything."

Isabella could see that Maximilian and Mira genuinely liked Abby. Besides, from many details, it was clear that they were good people. IfÂ Abby ended up with them, she'd be in good hands.

Isabella reached out to help Mira up and said, "I really want to help you, but when it comes to the child, I can't make the decision for her. Although Vanessa doesn't deserve to be a mother, she is still the child's biological mother. If you really want this child, you can try to have a talk with the child's father."

Hearing this, Mira burst into tears. "We've already looked for him, but he was very firm and refused to give us the child."

Maximilian looked at Abby in his arms, full of reluctance."As long as she's happy and healthy, that's all that matters. After all, she has parents. We want to be her parents, but we can't take away someone else's right to be parents."

ThenÂ Maximilian and Mira left with tears in their eyes.

At the police station...

In the visiting room, Peter met Vanessa.

He had been sitting there for half an hour. The moment Vanessa came in, Peter quickly stood up from his chair, looking a bit excited.

Vanessa, however, didn't even look at him and sat down directly.

An awkward silence fell between them.

Peter's eyes scanned Vanessa's face, taking in every detail.

Vanessa finally shifted under his scrutiny, growing impatient. "Do you have something to say? If not, I'm going back to sleep."

"Vanessa." Peter finally spoke urgently. He had so many questions he wanted to ask, but now that they met, he didn't know where to start. His voice caught in his throat, but he finally managed to ask, "Are you okay?"

Vanessa laughed. "What do you think? Being in here, how could I be fine?"

Peter said, "Vanessa, don't worry. I've hired a lawyer. The lawyer said that in your situation, since you're not the main culprit and have a good attitude about admitting your mistakes, you won't have to stay in prison for too long."

After Peter finished speaking, he looked at Vanessa with anticipation.

Vanessa just looked at him, her expression blank.

Peter smiled and said, "I went to see Penelope yesterday. She's doing well. Her skin is like yours, and she's very well-behaved."

Vanessa snapped, "Peter, are you just trying to annoy me?

"If you're bored, go find the lawyer and get the divorce papers ready. What are you trying to do now? Act like a devoted husband? I don't need that." Vanessa's eyes were full of coldness, and she was impatient.

Peter was silent for a moment. "Vanessa, I won't divorce you. I'll wait for you to come out. Even if it takes a lifetime, I'll wait for you."

Vanessa looked at him with a mocking smile. "Are you crazy? If you're sick, go see a doctor and get some medicine. If you're not, go home and get a good night's sleep to clear your head. Stop talking nonsense here."

Peter called, "Vanessa."

Vanessa stood up and said coldly, "Peter, someone like you can't move me. Don't waste your energy. Next time, bring the divorce papers, and I'll sign them."

When Vanessa returned to the holding area, the guard handed her a package."This is from your husband."

The packages were all inspected by the prison guards. Inside, there were merely some daily necessities, along with two books.

Vanessa frowned, sat against the wall, and opened the books.

Peter left the police station and went home.

As soon as he got off the elevator, he saw Athena sitting on the shoe bench at the door. She had been waiting for a while and was dozing off.

Peter walked over. "Athena."

Athena woke up in surprise and looked at Peter. "You are?"

Peter said, "Peter."

Athena asked, "Oh, Peter. You're married to Vanessa, right?"

Peter nodded. "Yes."

Athena pointed to herself. "You should know who I am, right?"

Peter nodded. "I know. I saw you that day when you were pulling Vanessa's hair and hitting her."

Athena pursed her lips. "Parents disciplining their children is a form of guidance. Vanessa lost her father at a young age, and as her mother, I also had to be half a father. She's my flesh and blood, so I have the right to discipline her."

Peter was at a loss for words for a moment and didn't argue with her. Instead, he asked calmly, "Do you need something from me?"

Athena said, "Of course. Since you're married to Vanessa, I'm your mother-in-law. How can you not invite me in when I'm at your door?"

Peter nodded. "Of course."

He took out his keys and opened the door.

Before he could invite her in, Athena had already walked in with big strides and even stepped onto the wooden floor of the living room without changing her shoes.

Peter frowned but didn't say anything. He changed his shoes and went to the kitchen to pour a glass of water. "Athena, please sit."

Athena looked around the house and then said, "You should call me Mom."

Peter nodded."Alright."

Then he called out, "Mom."

Athena smiled brightly and sat down opposite him. "This house must be at least a thousand square feet, right?"

Peter replied, "Yes. Fourteen hundred square feet."

Athena asked, "That must have cost a lot, right?"

Peter said, "Over two million dollars."

Athena grinned."I haven't asked you yet; what do you do for work?"

Peter understood her probing and answered truthfully, "I work at a small company."

Athena asked, "What exactly do you do?"

Peter answered, "I'm a programmer."

Athena said, "Oh, that must pay well, right?"

Peter said, "It's just so-so."

Athena asked, "How much do you make a month?"

Peter didn't answer immediately.

Athena's expression showed a hint of dissatisfaction. "What, you don't want to tell me? I'm not an outsider!"

Peter still had some prejudice against Athena because of the night when she humiliated Vanessa. But Athena was still Vanessa's mother.

Technically, Athena wasn't an outsider.

Peter said, "I make only twenty thousand dollars a month. After expenses, there's only a few thousand left."

Athena said, "Wow, that's pretty good. In our place, the highest salary is only five or six thousand dollars. Vanessa is really lucky to have you."

Peter smiled wryly and said, "I'm not good enough for Vanessa."

"Nonsense." Athena took his hand and patted it. "Peter, you're already very good. It's Vanessa who is lucky to have you."

Peter was happy to receive Athena's approval. But Athena's next words immediately made him freeze.

###chapter 307  It's Clean Once You're Dead

Athena asked, "How much money are you planning to give?"

Peter was taken aback and finally understood Athena's true purpose today.

Peter asked, "Are you here to ask for money?"

Athena clicked her tongue in displeasure. "How can you talk like that? What do you mean by asking for money? Vanessa is my daughter; I'm her mother. I raised her and paid for her education. She's the only college graduate in our family; her brothers didn't go to school. We've put so much into raising her, it wouldn't be fair for her to just leave without any consideration for our sacrifices, would it?"

After saying this, Athena watched Peter's reaction.

Peter lowered his eyes and, after a while, asked, "Have you discussed this with Vanessa?"

Athena said, "No need to discuss with her. I'm her mother, and I decide on the money matters."

Peter pressed his lips together. "So how much do you want?"

Athena thought for a moment and said, "Considering all the expenses, at least $1.2 million."

Peter frowned and thought,' $1.2 million is not a small amount for an average person. Is there really such a way as giving money like this?'

Seeing him frown, Athena immediately changed her tone. "I'm not asking for that much, but there should be something. Otherwise, people will think Vanessa is worthless and was given to you for free. Don't you agree?"

Peter thought this made sense. He didn't want to wrong Vanessa or tarnish her reputation.

Athena continued, "I know it's not easy for you to earn money, so I won't be too demanding. Just give $880,000. This includes all the jewelry and clothes. Vanessa can't have a wedding now, but I still need to go back and explain to the family. You don't need to worry about the banquet; I'll handle it."

$880,000 was not a small amount, especially for Peter. Although he had saved some money over the years, he had spent a lot on buying a house and a car. Emma had given Vanessa $1 million, but the remaining money was confiscated. He still needed money to hire a lawyer for Vanessa and wanted to bring Penelope back to raise her. Everything required money. Even if he had $880,000, he couldn't give it to Athena at once.

But Peter couldn't refuse directly, so he said, "I think we should discuss this with Vanessa first."

Athena's expression soured. "What's there to discuss? Peter, are you reluctant to spend the money? Do you think Vanessa should be your wife for free? Even if you bought a wife, it would cost more than $880,000, right?"

Athena's words were cutting, making Peter frown. "Vanessa is a person, not an item. My marriage to her was the result of meticulous consideration, with the aim of sharing our lives forever. Athena, it sounds like you're selling Vanessa to me for $880,000."

Athena stood up abruptly. "Fine, since you put it that way, I'll be straightforward. I don't like Vanessa, but I raised her and must get a return. If you give me $880,000, I'll cut ties with her and Vanessa will be yours. Whether she lives or dies, I won't appear in her life again."

Athena's words left Peter reeling. He stood up, firmly saying, "This must be approved by Vanessa. If she agrees, I'll give you $880,000. If she doesn't, you won't get a penny!"

Athena didn't expect Peter, who seemed easy to deceive, to be so clear-headed.

Athena's face was flushed with anger. She pointed at Peter. "Fine, remember what you said. I'll go find her now!"

Peter walked over and opened the door. "Take care. I won't see you out."

Athena stormed out in anger.

"Vanessa, you have a visitor," the guard's voice sounded in her ear.

Vanessa thought it was Peter and said, "Tell him to leave. I don't want to see him."

The guard left and returned after a while. "She says she's your mother and insists on seeing you."

Vanessa was stunned. After a while, she nodded and agreed to meet her.

In the visiting room, Athena looked coldly at Vanessa and said, "Why didn't you inform the family about your marriage to Peter?"

Vanessa lowered her eyes. "Why would I inform you? Three years ago, when you wanted to marry me off to an old man for hundreds of thousands of dollars, didn't you say you didn't have a daughter like me?"

"Don't you dare bring up that incident!" Athena's face was suffused with resentment. "If you hadn't stabbed him back then, would we have had to pay such a hefty sum? And you, you just walked away, leaving behind all the mess for me and your brothers to clean up. You ungrateful wretch, disappearing for years!"

Vanessa sneered. "I paid you back double, didn't I? What, are you never satisfied?"

Athena's face changed. "How dare you talk to your mother like that?"

"You're not my mother. I'm an orphan," Vanessa said coldly, ignoring Athena's anger and even provoking her.

Athena was so angry that she couldn't breathe. She clutched her chest and said, "I'm not here to argue. I just want to know if you're going to marry Peter for free."

Vanessa looked at Athena without speaking.

Athena said, "I have already spoken to Peter, and the amount is set at eight hundred and eighty-eight thousand dollars. He mentioned that you hold the financial reins in your family, so as long as you nodded."

Vanessa laughed. "Mom, are you daydreaming? $880,000? Why don't you rob a bank?"

Vanessa laughed so hard that tears almost came out.

Athena gritted her teeth. "I gave you life and raised you. Isn't that worth $880,000? Vanessa, give me $880,000, and we'll cut ties. I never want to see your face again!"

Vanessa slowly stopped laughing and leaned back in her chair. "Stop dreaming. I won't give you a penny."

Athena shouted, "Vanessa!"

"Don't worry, I'll repay this worthless life soon."

Vanessa said, "Don't worry. I'll repay this worthless life soon."

Â Vanessa's eyes were full of destruction, but Athena felt no pity. After being refused, Athena became furious and pointed at Vanessa. "You'd better die."

Vanessa tugged at her lips. "Okay."

Athena was speechless.

In the middle of the night, news came that Vanessa had committed suicide in prison.

###chapter 308  What Gives You the Right

Peter received a call and rushed to the hospital, where Vanessa was still in the emergency room.

The prison guard informed him that Vanessa had attempted suicide by ramming her head against the wall. The injuries were quite severe, with her skull fractured, and by the time she was brought in, she was nearly unconscious.

Peter took a few steps back, almost losing his balance.

The resuscitation lasted four hours, and Peter sat at the door, waiting anxiously, for the entire four hours.

Four hours later, dawn broke, and the light above the operating room door went out.

The doctor came out and asked, "Where is Vanessa's family?"

Peter's reaction had become sluggish, possibly from sitting too long. He turned his head to look at the doctor but didn't stand up for a long time. He sat there, froze.

The prison guard pointed at Peter and then stepped forward to ask, "How is Vanessa?"

At that moment, Peter felt as if he had gone deaf. All he could hear was a piercing buzz in his ears, and the doctor's lips moved soundlessly.

The prison guard walked up to him and said, "Peter, Peter, I'm talking to you. Can you hear me?"

Peter looked up, his throat dry as if swallowing knives, his face pale, at a loss for words.

The prison guard patted his shoulder and said, "Stay strong!"

Peter was stunned. All the strength drained from his body, leaving him feeling empty and hollow.

"My daughter, my daughter," Athena suddenly rushed out from down the hall, sat down at the emergency room door, and wailed, slapping the floor.

The scene was truly ironic. Peter couldn't bear to watch, so he looked away.

A nurse said, "Here is the death certificate. We need you to sign it."

Peter stood up and walked over numbly. He picked up the pen, but his hand trembled uncontrollably. Even when he tried to steady it with his other hand, it was no use.

At that moment, Athena sprang up from the floor, grabbed Peter's hand, and said, "You can't sign!"

Athena said, "I am the mother of the deceased; it's not your place as an outsider to sign this document." With that, Athena shoved Peter aside, grasped the pen, and signed the confirmation form.

The nurse confirmed there were no issues, nodded, and said, "You may now come in to bid her farewell; shortly, we will arrange for her to be taken to the morgue."

Athena and Peter entered the emergency room one after the other. They saw Vanessa lying there quietly. Now, she was just a cold, lifeless body.

Peter's feet felt like they were filled with lead. The moment he saw Vanessa, he couldn't move an inch.

Athena walked over, pinching her nose with a look of disdain. Then, she closed her eyes and muttered, "What bad luck. Gods, please forgive me."

After confirming Vanessa's death, the officer turned to Peter and Athena and said, "She is still a convict. You can't take her away. You need to complete some paperwork at the station. After cremation, we will hand over her ashes to you."

Before Peter could speak, Athena nodded repeatedly. "We don't want the ashes either. Please handle them for us."

The officer was speechless.

Peter took a step forward. "I want them!"

Athena looked at him. "Why do you want them?"

Peter said, "Because I'm her husband!"

Athena said, "Husband? As Vanessa's mother, how come I don't know she has a husband like you? Did you pay for it, or did you do anything for her? I'm already being generous by not accusing you of marrying her under false pretenses. You still want to claim her ashes? Dream on. I don't agree!"

Peter ignored Athena and followed the officer to the station to complete the paperwork.

After the paperwork was done, the prison guard handed Vanessa's belongings to Peter. It was the same package Peter had brought earlier, with almost nothing touched inside. Even the letter he had handwritten remained unopened.

Peter held the package and burst into tears.

The following day, Vanessa was cremated in a somber ceremony.

When the urn was brought out, Peter instinctively reached for it, but Athena got it first.

Athena said, "This is my daughter. I gave birth to her, I raised her, and I want to take her home!"

Despite her words, Athena made no move to leave with the urn. Instead, she stared at Peter with calculating eyes.

Peter sighed, "You just want money, don't you?"

He took a bank card out of his pocket and said, "There are one million dollars on this card. Give me Vanessa's ashes."

Athena's eyes lit up at the mention of a million dollars, but she remained cautious. "A million dollars? Are you sure you're not lying?"

Peter's expression was cold. "If you don't believe me, you can check at a nearby bank."

"Fine." Athena took the card, "You come with me."

Peter nodded.

There was an ATM just 150 feet from the station.

Athena moved with swift strides towards the machine, clutching the urn tightly, afraid that Peter might snatch it away.

To Athena, it wasn't just an urn of ashes but a million dollars!

Once the bank card was inserted, the balance was successfully checked. Athena leaned in, her eyes wide with excitement, and counted the numbers ten times. That string of digits left her feeling exhilarated.

Peter stood silently by, his eyes hollow and lifeless.

After Athena retrieved the card, he finally spoke, "Can you give it to me now?"

"Sure, sure." Athena smiled broadly and immediately handed over the urn.

Whether from excitement or something else, Athena's hand slipped, and the urn fell to the ground.

The lid opened slightly, and the gray ashes scattered on the ground.

Peter froze.

Athena's expression changed. Her first reaction was to pocket the bank card and then shift the blame. "What's wrong with you? Can't you hold it properly? How heavy can an urn be? Now it's on the ground!"

Peter said nothing and ignored her. He squatted down and began to gather the scattered ashes with his hands.

Since it had just rained, the ground was still wet. The ashes stuck to the damp surface, making it difficult to collect them. But Peter carefully picked up every bit, placing them back into the urn.

Seeing this, Athena pouted in displeasure. "This isn't my fault. You didn't catch it properly. You can't blame me!"

"Watching Peter's reverence, Athena felt displeased. She remarked, "How is it that Vanessa has such remarkable fortune to encounter a man as genuine and sincere as you? I can't fathom what kind of luck she has."

"But she wasn't blessed enough. She couldn't think straight and committed suicide. Just thinking about it hurts."

"When Vanessa was still alive, I asked for $880,000, but you didn't give me. Now that she's dead, you're willing to give a million dollars. If you had given it earlier, wouldn't there have been less trouble?"

Peter suddenly looked up. "Shut up!"

###chapter 309  Return

"Shut up!"

Athena shuddered in fear.

Peter stood up, clutching the urn, his face contorted with malice, his eyes burning with a voracious intensity. "Get out!" he snarled.

Peter was a big guy, but he usually wore a gentle smile, giving off an impression of being honest and kind. However, even honest people had their limits, and when they get angry, they can be more terrifying than most people.

Clearly, Peter's patience with Athena was nearing its end.

Athena glanced at Peter's hand, which was covered in ashes and clenched into a fist, the bones creaking. She shrank back in fear. "Okay, okay, I'm leaving. I'm leaving."

With that, she ran off without looking back.

Peter's bloodshot eyes followed Athena until she disappeared from his sight. Then he lowered his head, his tightly clenched fingers slowly relaxing. He gently stroked the lid of the urn. "Vanessa, don't be afraid. I'm taking you home now. We're going home."

Two days later, at the hospital.

Maximilian and Mira were playing with the baby.Â 

Maximilian said, "Our Abby is finally better. Yes, she's been through a lot these past few days, but she'll be fine now. Our Abby will grow up healthy and never get sick again."

"I wonder when Mr. Prescott will come to take the baby. I've been on edge these past few days. Just thinking about Abby being taken away breaks my heart." Mira's eyes welled up with tears as she spoke.

Maximilian put his arm around her shoulders, and his eyes were also a bit moist. "Don't think like that. The baby is too young to make a choice. Put yourself in their shoes; who wouldn't want to be with their biological parents? If we truly love Abby, we should let her go back and reunite with her parents."

"Yes." Mira forced a bitter smile and kissed the baby's forehead. "But I really can't bear to part with Abby." She burst into tears.

Maximilian turned to get some tissues but accidentally saw Peter standing at the door.

Maximilian froze. "Mr. Prescott?"

Mira turned around, instinctively clutching Abby tighter at the sight of Peter. Then, realizing her reaction, she loosened her grip slightly and looked at him.

"Mr. Prescott, come in and sit down." Maximilian invited Peter in, offering him water and fruit.

Mira sat on the edge of the hospital bed, holding Abby and keeping her head down, remaining silent.

Peter got straight to the point. "No need. I'm here to take the baby today."

Maximilian and Mira both stiffened.

Tears welled up in Mira's eyes.

Maximilian forced a smile and handed a teacup to Peter. "Of course, of course. I'll go handle the discharge paperwork. Once it's done, you can take the baby home."

Peter put down the teacup. "I'll do it."

He glanced at Mira and said, "Take a moment to properly say goodbye to the child."

With that, Peter took the stack of papers from Maximilian and left.

There weren't many people discharged from the hospital. Peter didn't rush to complete the paperwork; instead, he sat on a nearby bench for half an hour.

When the time was right, Peter completed the paperwork and went to the ward to get Abby.

When Peter opened the door, he found Maximilian and Mira already packed. One was holding bags, and the other was holding Abby.

Maximilian stepped forward. "Mr. Prescott, we'd like to take you and the baby home, if that's okay?"

Peter nodded. "That's fine."

Maximilian was delighted. "Good, good."

The three of them left the hospital together. When Peter took out his phone to call a cab, Maximilian said, "Take my car. I'll drive. Just tell me the address."

"Okay." Peter put away his phone.

Once in the car, Peter gave an address, and Maximilian drove in that direction.

The car was silent. At an intersection, Maximilian asked, "I remember you drove here last time, Mr. Prescott?"

"Yes," Peter replied, pausing. "I sold it."

Maximilian didn't ask further.

When they arrived, Maximilian saw it was an old, rundown neighborhood.

Peter led the way to his apartment on the fifth floor.

Peter unlocked the door with his key, revealing a small house filled with clutter and disarray, with numerous cardboard boxes piled up by the entrance.

"Did you just move here?" Maximilian asked.

Peter nodded. "Yes. I moved in yesterday, so I haven't had time to tidy up."

Maximilian and Mira exchanged a glance, unable to hold back their curiosity. "I remember you used to live in a new neighborhood?"

"I sold the house," Peter said nonchalantly, "This place is old, but it's cheap."

Maximilian quickly asked, "Are you in some kind of trouble? Do you need help?"

"No need." Peter shook his head, firmly refusing.

Maximilian didn't press further.

Abby had fallen asleep in Mira's arms. Mira asked, "Where's the baby's room?"

Peter opened the master bedroom door and tidied the bed a bit. "Put her here."

Mira reluctantly kissed Abby twice before biting her lip and leaving in tears.

Mira feared that if she stayed a second longer, she would regret it and fight Peter for Abby.

With an awkward smile, Maximilian said. "We'll be going now."

Peter said, "I'll see you out."

"No need, no need. You must be busy." Maximilian left quickly, almost tripping on his way out.

Once outside, Maximilian and Mira got into their car and cried for over half an hour.

That night, neither Maximilian nor Mira could sleep. They lay awake until dawn.

The next morning, Maximilian got up to make breakfast.

Maximilian and Mira sat at the dining table in silence, facing their breakfast, neither of them touching their forks.

After a long while, Maximilian spoke, "We should eat something. Someone's coming to see the house later."

Mira was taken aback. "We were selling the house to take Abby away. Is that still necessary?"

Mira thought to herself, 'Without Abby, what's the point of selling the house?'

After a pause, Maximilian agreed. "You're right. It's not necessary anymore."

He looked at Mira's gaunt face and dark circles, sighing. "You always wanted to go to the beach when we were young. Let's sell the house, go on a beach vacation, and decide what to do next after we've had our fill."

Mira shook her head. "I'm not leaving. Because Abby is still in Emerald Isle City. I'm staying here. When I miss her, I'll sneak a peek."

As she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes and spilled over.

Maximilian didn't know how to comfort her. His heart felt heavy and pained.

Just then, the doorbell rang.

###chapter 310  Is It Difficult?

Maximilian went to open the door and found Peter standing there holding Abby. He was momentarily stunned.

Peter said, "May I come in?"

"Of course, of course," Maximilian quickly responded, inviting them inside.

Mira also emerged from the dining room, tears still on her face, and hurriedly embraced Abby.

"Abby," Mira held Abby as if she were holding the whole world.

"Mr. Prescott, please have a seat," Maximilian quickly offered.

Peter sat down on the sofa.

Maximilian said, "Have you had breakfast? I just made some. Would you like to join us, Mr. Prescott?"

"No, thank you," Peter waved his hand.

Over there, Mira was playing with Abby, who was giggling in her arms.

Seeing this, Peter relaxed.

"Mr. Prescott, is there something you need this early?" Maximilian nervously rubbed his fingers. His question also drew Mira's attention. Both Mira and Maximilian looked at Peter with cautious and fragile eyes.

Peter said, "After you left yesterday, the child cried for a long time."

"Abby doesn't cry," She quickly soothed Abby in a soft voice. Mira's heart was breaking as she heard this.

Maximilian said, "Maybe she's not used to the bed. Since Abby came to our house, Mira has been taking care of her constantly. The child might be recognizing the scent. Knowing Mira is not there, she might feel a bit uneasy. It's nothing serious; Abby is still young. She'll get used to it over time."

Despite his words, the pain in Maximilian's eyes was unmistakable.

Peter let out a bitter smile. "I pondered all night yesterday and still believe that Abby cannot be without a mother."

Maximilian expressed regret, "We are also very sorry about Abby's mother. Everyone's life has its own path. Mr. Prescott, don't blame yourself too much."

"Alright." Peter nodded lightly. Suddenly, he knelt down from the sofa. "I have an unreasonable request."

Maximilian was startled and quickly reached out to help him. "Mr. Prescott, what are you doing? Please get up."

Peter didn't get up but sincerely made his request, "Abby needs a complete family. I probably won't marry again in this lifetime. I grew up without parents, so I know what it feels like. I don't want the child to suffer the same way Vanessa and I did. So, I hope you can continue to adopt Abby and raise her as your own."

Maximilian was stunned. "Mr. Prescott."

Mira, with tears in her eyes, said, "But Mr. Prescott, can you really bear to do this? After all, she is your child."

"I can't bear it." Peter tugged at the corner of his mouth. "But I want her to have a healthy family environment and grow up carefree. Over these days, I've seen how much you love and care for Abby. She will be very happy with parents like you."

With a thud, Mira knelt down. "If you're truly willing, Mr. Prescott, we promise to love and care for Abby with all our hearts. We'll raise her well and do everything we can to protect her from harm and sadness."

Maximilian also assured, "Rest assured, we have no children of our own; Abby is like our own child. Mr. Prescott, there's no need to be so disheartened. A child surrounded by love is a happy child."

Peter's eyes lit up.

"Yes." Mira smiled. "From now on, Abby will have two sets of parents."

Isabella and the others stayed in Emerald Isle City for another three days. During these three days, she and Sebastian took Sweetie around, buying a lot of things.

They returned to the hotel in the evening. Seeing the room filled with stuff, Isabella was a bit taken aback. "Oh my, did I really buy this much?"

Sebastian hugged her from behind and agreed, "It is quite a lot."

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Why didn't you stop me?"

Sebastian asked, "Stop you from what?"

Isabella said, "Stop me from buying so much. How much did all this cost?"

Isabella was bewildered.

Isabella, who had always been so frugal, thought of buying some gifts for everyone when she came to Emerald Isle City. To her surprise, once she started shopping, she couldn't stop. She found that this scarf was perfect for Nina, that dress suited Kelsey, and that handbag was ideal for Miley.

She kept buying, and suddenly she had bought so much!

Angela thought, 'I really spent money without blinking.'

Looking at the room full of stuff, Isabella finally realized she had been a bit extravagant.

Seeing Isabella's face full of guilt, Sebastian kissed her on the nose. "I have money, so buy what you like."

Isabella laughed. "But I bought too much. Next time, stop me, okay?"

Sebastian refused, "No."

Isabella was puzzled. "So you'll just watch me waste money?"

Sebastian bent down, picked Isabella up horizontally, and walked towards the master bedroom. "It's not often Mrs. Landon treats herself. Why not let her have some fun?"

Entering the master bedroom, Sebastian used his foot to close the door and walked straight to the bed.

Isabella felt her back sink into the mattress as Sebastian placed her on the bed. He loosened his collar and leaned down, his eyes filled with Isabella's reflection. "If you really feel bad, how about kissing me?"

Isabella's cheeks flushed. Sebastian's gaze was so intense that she couldn't look directly at him. "What if I still feel bad after the kiss?"

Sebastian smiled slightly, his long fingers untying Isabella's dress belt, his hand grasping her soft, slender waist. "Then make it up to me."

Isabella blinked, pretending not to understand. "How?"

As soon as she finished speaking, Sebastian spread her legs, lowered his head, and kissed her from her lips to her neck, then to her ear, his hot and heavy voice like a spell. "I'll teach you."

At the critical moment, Jack's voice came from outside the door. "Mr. Landon, Miss Landon is crying."

Along with Jack's voice, Sweetie's clear cries could be heard.

Sebastian didn't want to respond, but Isabella immediately pushed him away, hurriedly dressed, and went to open the door.

"What happened?" Isabella took Sweetie in her arms.

"I don't know." Jack scratched his head.

No sooner were the words out of his mouth than a pillow came flying, smacking him right in the head.

Sebastian stormed over, his face thunderous "You can't even take care of a child! What good are you?"

Jack was bewildered. "Mr. Landon, I have no experience in this."

Sebastian glanced at Jack. "Is it really that hard?"

"Yes." Jack wanted to say that taking care of Sweetie was really difficult, far from as easy as he had imagined. But facing Sebastian's cold gaze, he swallowed his words.

Jack thought, 'I won't say anything.'

Isabella tried to soothe Sweetie, but she kept crying.

She asked, "Is she hungry?"

Jack replied, "She just had milk ten minutes ago."

Isabella asked, "Did she wet herself?"

Jack answered, "Just changed her diaper."

"Then what's wrong?" Isabella was also at a loss. Since Sweetie was born, she hadn't taken care of her for a single day.

Sebastian, feeling distressed, reached out. "Give her to me."

As soon as Sweetie was in Sebastian's arms, she immediately stopped crying.

###chapter 311  Looking at Faces

Sebastian gave Sweetie's tiny nose a gentle boop, and she let out the cutest cooing sounds, melting Sebastian's heart on the spot.

Cradling Sweetie, Sebastian shot a look at Jack. "My kid's all chill, and you can't even keep her calm?"

Jack was at a loss for words. Honestly, he had no clue what he was doing wrong.

He'd been trying to soothe Sweetie for over ten minutes. Seeing her about to cry her lungs out, he knew Sebastian would flip if she did. So, Jack had no choice but to call for backup.

Why did Sweetie turn into a little angel the second Sebastian held her?

"The sun's out and shining. Take Sweetie for a stroll and let her soak up some rays. She loves the sun," Sebastian said, handing Sweetie over to Jack.

"Got it, Mr. Landon." Jack took her carefully.

But as soon as Sebastian let go, Sweetie started wailing like there was no tomorrow.

Sebastian's eyes narrowed at Jack, who stood there like a statue, too scared to move.

Sebastian circled Jack and finally figured it out. "You're holding her wrong. Do it like this, and this."

Jack adjusted his hold, following Sebastian's lead.

But five minutes later, after trying every position in the book, Sweetie was still crying her heart out.

Sebastian was worn out from all the instructions and started seriously doubting Jack's skills for the first time.

Jack was speechless. This was the biggest crisis he'd faced in his career.

He could handle any company issue and was a pro at cooking and cleaning, but Sweetie had him stumped!

Isabella, watching from the sidelines, got it. "Sebastian, Sweetie probably only recognizes you."

Sebastian took Sweetie back, and just like that, she stopped crying and turned into the quiet, sweet baby again.

Even with her eyes closed the whole time, she was as precise as a well-oiled machine.

Sebastian looked at Jack and said, "My daughter's a genius. She can judge people by their looks already."

Jack thought, 'So, does that mean I'm ugly?'

Sebastian took Sweetie inside, and Isabella patted Jack's shoulder with a smile, trying to cheer him up, "Don't sweat it. Sweetie takes after me."

Jack was speechless.

The next day, Sebastian chartered a plane and flew back to Lakina.

When they landed, a big crowd was waiting at the gate.

As soon as Isabella and the crew walked over, everyone swarmed them.

"Nina." Isabella called out, but Nina walked right past her like she was invisible.

Everyone else did the same, ignoring Isabella and Sebastian, and went straight for Sweetie, surrounding her.

Nina said, "She's so tiny, so sweet, and so cute. No wonder she's called Sweetie; it's perfect."

During the flight, Sweetie had been snoozing in Sebastian's arms. Apparently, she had enough sleep and was now wide awake. She opened her sleepy eyes and smiled at anyone who played with her.

"She smiled at me," Kelsey said, all excited.

"I'm your grandma; let me hold you," Margaret said lovingly.

Zaire kept his distance but couldn't help chuckling. "Mom, she doesn't even have teeth yet, and you want her to call you grandma? Isn't that a bit much?"

Margaret shot Zaire a look that could kill.

Zaire zipped it and noticed Miley snapping pics of Sweetie. He squinted.

"Miley, you into boys or girls?" Margaret asked, not-so-subtly.

Miley grinned. "I like girls."

"Well, isn't that something? Zaire likes girls too. Steven and I are all about girls. If you have a girl, she'll be as gorgeous as you," Margaret said, laying it on thick.

Miley, amused and a bit helpless, glanced at Zaire.

Zaire turned away and started chatting with Sebastian.

"Must be over the moon," Zaire said, a hint of jealousy in his voice, "having a little princess."

Sebastian nodded.

Zaire was at a loss for words.

Zaire nudged Sebastian with his shoulder. "Come on, man, show a little humility."

Sebastian looked at Zaire dead serious. "Why should I? It's the truth."

The crew headed back to Isabella and Sebastian's place, and the gifts Isabella had bought for everyone had just arrived. She handed them out right then and there.

The ladies were downstairs, tearing into their presents, while the guys headed upstairs to chill.

Seeing Sebastian still holding Sweetie, Zaire raised an eyebrow and smirked. "Can't you put her down for a sec? Aren't your arms tired?"

Sebastian replied, "Nope, not at all."

Zaire shook his head. "I'm getting tired just watching you."

Sebastian shot back, "You wouldn't get it. You don't have a daughter."

Zaire was speechless. He shook his head with a grin. "Alright, alright, you're showing off now? Is having a daughter really that awesome?"

Sebastian said, "Yep. And I'll keep showing off, so get used to it. Having a daughter is the best."

Zaire was too exasperated to respond.

He waved his hand. "The kid's back, and the Landon family is toast. When's the wedding?"

Sebastian said, "I'm planning it soon. Got any good ideas?"

Zaire, green with envy, started giving Sebastian the worst suggestions. "How about an aerial wedding? Rent a helicopter, pick up the bride, and circle over Lakina. Then, scatter flowers from the sky, letting all of Lakina see your epic wedding."

Sebastian thought for a moment and nodded. "Sounds cool. What else?"

Zaire said, "A water wedding could be awesome too. Rent a yacht and a submarine, and dive into the deep sea to check out sharks. How epic would that be?"

Sebastian said, "Yeah, that's good too."

Zaire suggested, "Or you could rent a castle and have the wedding there. Every girl's dream, right? Isabella would never forget it."

Sebastian frowned. "A castle, huh."

Zaire jumped in, "I can rent you my castle at a discount. Friendly price. What do you say?"

Sebastian glanced at him. "Who wants yours?"

He turned to Jack. "Note down Zaire's ideas and refine the details later. There are a few tweaks. No need to rent the helicopter and yacht; buy new ones. If we can't buy a submarine, we'll rent one. And for the castle, let's build a new one."

Zaire was floored!

###chapter 312 Loving Someone Like Tending to Flowers

Jack gave a nod, totally on board.

Zaire was floored. After a long pause, he finally blurted out, "You for real?"

Sebastian shot back, "Who treats marriage like a joke? Of course, I'm serious."

Zaire stammered, "Those points I mentioned earlier, I was just winging it."

Zaire thought, 'Who goes this nuts over a wedding?'

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Really? Then it seems Mr. Jose's random ideas are way better than his usual ones."

Zaire said, "You can buy a helicopter and a yacht, but blowing cash on a castle is just dumb. I got one ready-made; you can use it for free. Heck, you can even move in if you want."

Sebastian shook his head. "We're only getting hitched once; I don't want to shortchange Bella."

Zaire nodded. "True that. You've already taken over the Landon and Anderson families. Now, with just a flick of your wrist, the whole business world of Lakina is shaking. You've got the dough, not caring about the cost."

As he spoke, Zaire felt something was off. Suddenly, he realized, "Sebastian, what do you mean by saying getting married in my castle would shortchange Bella? My castle is a dream spot for many girls, and the entrance fee is sky-high. How would it shortchange your wife?"

Sebastian calmly looked at Zaire. "You said it yourself; it's a dream spot for many girls. Who knows how many women you've taken there over the years to fool around?"

Zaire clenched his fists, fuming with indignation.

Zaire said, "I used to think you were just annoying, now I feel like you deserve a good smack."

Sebastian, expressionless, looked down to soothe Sweetie, "Zaire's face is kinda ugly; let's not look."

As he spoke, Sebastian used his hand to cover Sweetie's eyes.

Zaire was speechless.

Jack's lips curled into a slight smile, feeling much more balanced inside. Now, in Sebastian's eyes, apart from Isabella and Sweetie, nothing else seemed to matter.

"Nina, this is a bracelet I got for you." Isabella pulled out a fancy box from her bag.

"Why blow money on this?" Nina remarked, though she couldn't hide her smile. She immediately started to take off the bracelet on her wrist to try on the one Isabella bought.

Isabella picked up Nina's bracelet and felt it was way better than the one she bought.

Isabella asked, "Nina, when did you get this bracelet? I've never seen it before."

Nina smiled and said, "Richard gave it to me."

Before Isabella could speak, Kelsey jumped in, "Bella, you don't know because you were in Emerald Isle City recently. Richard didn't just give Nina a bracelet; he gave her a whole jewelry company! It's in the new commercial district Zaire planned, spans multiple floors, and is currently getting a makeover."

Isabella was stunned. "A jewelry company?"

Kelsey, finding it awkward to talk from a distance, sat down next to her. "Yeah, because Richard accidentally saw Nina's design sketches and knew she loved jewelry design, he bought the shop for her. Nina's gonna be the owner of a jewelry company. Isn't that wild?"

"Wild." Isabella felt both surprised and delighted. "I always knew Nina was good at cooking, but I've never seen you draw design sketches before."

"I used to draw," Nina admitted, feeling a bit shy with everyone watching. "I did it in secret, and Charlie caught me a few times. He always said my drawings were ugly and that I didn't get jewelry design. Every time he found out, he'd toss my sketches in the trash. So, I just stopped. But selling small accessories for so long, I saw a ton of designs, and they stuck with me."

"He's just trying to mess with your head," Kelsey said, clearly pissed on Nina's behalf. "Even without formal training, your stuff is already awesome. If you had studied, you'd be a rockstar! Charlie's just a useless jerk who doesn't want you to outshine him."

Isabella nodded in strong agreement.

Nina was like a hidden gem, unfortunately picked up by Charlie. Instead of polishing her, Charlie did everything to keep her down, making Nina lose all her confidence so he could feel superior.

But now, Nina had Richard. Richard would carefully wipe away the dust, letting her shine with her true brilliance.

After a trip to Emerald Isle City, Isabella realized that Nina had become her best self.

Isabella thought, 'Love and indifference really do look different.'

Isabella said, "Love is like tending flowers. I used to have my doubts about Richard, but now I see, with him, Nina is really thriving."

Nina smiled and looked down. "He does treat me very well."

Then, Nina pulled out her phone and showed Isabella info about the jewelry company.

"Nina and Isabella Jewelry." As soon as Isabella saw the name, she got it.

Nina said, "Bella, this is my first time starting a company, and I'm not super confident. I was thinking, if you're free, could you come and help me? With you around, I won't be scared. I've reserved fifty percent of the shares for you."

Over the years, Nina had almost gotten used to having Isabella around.

Just like when Nina first started working, she was too scared to go alone, and Isabella went with her.

In the beginning, it was also Isabella who toughened up to negotiate with customers.

As Nina said, as long as Isabella was there, she wasn't afraid of anything.

For Nina's decision, neither Richard nor the Jose family objected; they all showed strong support.

"Nina, I can help you. But I can't take the shares," Isabella said, "I have Sebastian now, and everything's great. I want to help you like before. You just move forward boldly, and I'll always have your back."

Kelsey quickly came over and hugged Nina's arm. "I want to help too, so Mom and Dad won't nag me all day, saying I'm not doing anything serious."

Nina chuckled, "Alright, with you guys around, I'll move forward boldly."

Kelsey and Isabella said together, "Alright."

Margaret wiped her tears nearby. At that moment, her phone rang. She glanced at Kelsey, Nina, and Isabella still on the sofa, then stepped out to the balcony to answer the call.

Margaret greeted, "Hello, Cheryl."

Cheryl said, "Margaret, I got what you wanted."

###chapter 313  The Baby Cried

Margaret's eyes lit up. "For real? That's awesome!"

Cheryl grinned. "Yeah. Ms. Stewart's a big shot in the design world, and this is her first lecture here. Spots are super limited. You have no idea the hoops I jumped through to snag this for you. You owe me big time."

Margaret chuckled. "Absolutely. You've done so much for me; I'll make sure to repay you generously."

Cheryl laughed. "Come on, we've been friends forever; I'm just messing with you. But seriously, why the sudden interest in jewelry design?"

Margaret looked a bit sheepish. "It's my daughter. She's really into this stuff and wants to start her own design company. I figured a class from an international pro could really help her out."

Cheryl nodded. "Got it. Your daughter's been through a lot; she deserves all the support."

Margaret glanced out the window at Kelsey, Nina, and Isabella still hanging out inside, feeling a mix of comfort and sadness. "Yeah. I owe her so much."

Richard showed up just in time for dinner.

After dinner, everyone hung out for a bit before saying their goodbyes and heading out.

Naturally, Nina left with Richard; those two were clearly head over heels.

Margaret had her doubts about Richard at first, but seeing how well he treated Nina over time, she let go of her worries.

But when Margaret turned around, she noticed Kelsey still standing there, not making a move to get in the car.

"Kelsey?" Margaret called out, signaling her to hop in.

Kelsey said, "Mom, you go ahead. I'll catch a ride with Zaire later."

Margaret glanced at Miley and frowned. "Come back with me. Why take Zaire's car?"

She didn't want Kelsey to be the third wheel with Zaire and Miley.

Kelsey got the hint and was about to come up with another excuse when Jack stepped in. "Mrs. Jose, I'll take her home later."

Margaret's eyes shifted to Jack, then back to Kelsey, whose face was turning red. She got the picture instantly.

Even though Jack came from a regular background, he was the assistant to the CEO of the Landon Group, making a decent living. Plus, the Jose family never judged by background; Steven had built everything from scratch, and they valued character more.

Margaret trusted Isabella and Sebastian's judgment, so she had no issues with Jack. Her only worry was Kelsey's overly enthusiastic nature, fearing it might scare Jack off.

But in the end, it was the young folks' business, and as an elder, she shouldn't meddle too much.

With that in mind, Margaret felt relieved and didn't push Kelsey to come back with her, waving her off and leaving first.

Zaire pulled the car around, and Miley hopped in. They took off.

Kelsey's eyes sparkled as she looked at Jack, her hopes clear as day.

Jack, being a bit shy, wasn't as bold in front of others. He avoided her gaze and said, "I'll get the car."

With that, he headed to the garage.

Kelsey quickly followed. "I'll come with you."

Jack slowed his pace on purpose, and the two of them strolled side by side to the garage.

Nina watched them, feeling pretty pleased. "Looks like those two are gonna be a thing soon."

Isabella smiled and nodded. "Yeah, Jack's a good guy. Kelsey won't have any complaints with him."

Isabella and Nina stood on the steps, chatting for a bit. A cool breeze blew, and Isabella sneezed.

Next thing she knew, there was a coat on her shoulders. Sebastian had somehow appeared beside her, draping his coat over her.

Nina smiled at the scene, and suddenly felt a weight on her own shoulder. She turned her head and met Richard's deep gaze.

Richard's scarred hand rested on her shoulder. "It's getting late; we should head out."

"Okay." Nina nodded and said goodbye to Isabella.

With everyone leaving, Sebastian took Isabella's hand and led her back inside.

After a day like that, they were both pretty wiped out.

Isabella grabbed some clothes. "I'm gonna take a shower."

As soon as she stepped into the bathroom, Sebastian followed her in.

Isabella stood in front of the mirror, washing up, and Sebastian hugged her from behind. "Shall we shower together?"

Isabella blushed and elbowed him, her mouth full of foam, mumbling.

Sebastian grinned. "What did you say? I didn't catch that."

Isabella spat out the foam. "I said-"

Before she could finish, Sebastian tilted his head and kissed her neck, one of her most sensitive spots, known only to her and Sebastian.

Sebastian knew exactly what he was doing, teasing her on purpose.

His hand slipped under her shirt, feeling her shiver, his eyes darkening.

Isabella, teased by Sebastian, could barely stand. She turned around, her arms weakly draped over his shoulders, feeling a bit dazed.

Suddenly, Sweetie's cries came from outside.

Sebastian froze.

Isabella smiled helplessly, her hand still on his shoulder. "Our baby is crying."

Sebastian kissed her lips hard. "Looks like we need to hire a nanny."

Sebastian thought, 'How many times has this happened? Every time at a crucial moment, Sweetie cries. If this keeps up, my sex life is doomed.'

Sebastian had to suppress his frustration and went out to soothe Sweetie.

Isabella continued washing up.

When she finished her shower and came out, she found the bedroom quiet. Sebastian was lying on the bed with Sweetie in his arms, both of them asleep.

Isabella chuckled, walked over, and covered them with a blanket. She sat by the bed, gazing at the sleeping Sebastian and Sweetie, her heart filled with warmth.

The dark gray car sped down the asphalt road, the wind howling past the windows.

Zaire closed the window, shutting out the noise.

Seeing Miley staring at her phone, he glanced over. "You really like kids that much?"

"Yeah, they're so cute!" Miley was looking at the photos she had taken of Sweetie, each one capturing the most adorable moments.

Zaire felt a bit jealous. "Stop looking, no matter how much you look, she's not yours. Why not look at me more?"

"Look at you? You're not mine either." Miley raised an eyebrow at him.

Zaire pulled the car over, turned on the hazard lights, and leaned closer. "At least tonight, I'm yours."

Miley pushed his face away without mercy. "Tonight, I'm only interested in kids."

###chapter 314 I Want a Child

Zaire reached over and tapped her phone. "Quit staring at it."

Miley grabbed her phone again. "Gonna edit these pics and send 'em to Isabella."

She was so into it that even with Zaire giving her the side-eye, she kept on editing.

Zaire's excitement fizzled out. He fired up the car and started driving.

After a bit, Miley said, "All done."

Zaire stayed quiet, just driving.

Miley didn't look at him either, eyes straight ahead. After a long pause, she said softly, "Mr. Jose, I want a kid."

Zaire slammed on the brakes when he heard that.

The car screeched to a stop, leaving a gray tire mark on the road.

"What did you just say?" Zaire gripped the steering wheel, staring at Miley like she was nuts.

Miley said seriously, "I want a kid."

Zaire was quiet for a few seconds, then said, "Why not get a dog instead?"

"A kid and a dog are pretty much the same," Zaire said.

To Zaire, a dog was way easier to handle than a kid, less drama, and could even guard the house.

Miley looked away, leaned back in her seat, and a faint smile played on her lips. "Mr. Jose, you sure know how to joke."

"I'm not joking." Zaire restarted the car and said seriously, "If you think I'm not giving enough money, just ask for more. But don't dream about unrealistic stuff."

Miley felt a pang in her heart. 'Unrealistic?' She didn't say anything more.

Zaire lost interest too. He had planned to hit up a hotel, but now he made a U-turn and took Miley home instead.

"Where are my peaches?" Kelsey asked Jack as soon as she got in the car.

Jack said, "They're at my place."

Kelsey asked, "You haven't been home since you landed, so how are they at your place?"

"I mailed 'em back," Jack said, "They got there five minutes ago. Was gonna bring 'em to you tomorrow."

Kelsey said, "I want 'em now!"

"Alright." Jack drove back home.

At this hour, parking was tight, so Jack went to find a spot and gave Kelsey the house key to go up first.

It wasn't Kelsey's first time there, so she knew the place. She took the elevator up and used the key to open the door.

As soon as she pushed the door open, she noticed the lights were on and heard water running in the kitchen.

Kelsey was startled and thought, 'Did a thief break into Jack's place?'

She quietly opened a cabinet, grabbed a long umbrella, and held it as she slowly approached the kitchen.

The water stopped, and footsteps headed towards the door.

Kelsey silently counted in her head, and just as the person stepped out of the kitchen, she swung the umbrella wildly at them.

What she heard was a woman's scream.

At first, Kelsey didn't stop and hit a couple more times.

When Kelsey finally stopped, she saw a woman crouching on the floor.

Nancy was wearing a nightgown, her hair down, crouching with her hands over her head. At her feet were scattered plastic fruit trays and freshly washed peaches rolling around.

As soon as Kelsey stopped, Nancy looked up to see who had hit her.

When the two women locked eyes, both were equally stunned.

Kelsey called, "Nancy?"

Nancy called, "Ms. Jose?"

A noise came from the doorway, and Jack walked in.

"Jack." Nancy stood up, looking all pitiful at him.

Jack was stunned for a moment. He changed his shoes and walked in, his eyes sweeping over the mess on the floor and then noticing the bruise on Nancy's cheek. Then he saw the umbrella in Kelsey's hand and instantly got the whole picture.

Seeing Nancy made Kelsey even more furious.

She'd dealt with Nancy a few times and knew a bit about her.

Seeing Nancy move closer to Jack, Kelsey felt even more uncomfortable. She stepped forward and pulled Jack to her side. "Why is she in your house?"

Jack clearly didn't know either and looked to Nancy for an explanation.

"Jack, I'm sorry; I had nowhere else to go." Nancy stood there. One of her slippers was missing, her toes curled tightly together, her thin shoulders trembling slightly, and tears streaming down, making her look super pitiful.

Kelsey, however, wasn't buying Nancy's act and said coldly, "Nancy, you already broke up with Jack, and now I'm his girlfriend. Despite him having a girlfriend, you still moved into his house without permission. I won't guess your intentions, but I'm very territorial. I'm warning you; stay away from Jack!"

Nancy bit her lip and looked at Jack.

Jack hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the sofa, picked up the slipper, and placed it by Nancy's feet.

Nancy's face showed a hint of joy, while Kelsey bit her lip tightly.

"Jack." Nancy put on the slipper, trying to continue acting weak.

But Jack interrupted her, "Give me the key."

Nancy was stunned but obediently took the key out of her bag and handed it to Jack.

"You have ten minutes to pack your things and leave. I won't be seeing you off." Jack said, then turned to Kelsey. "I'll wash the peaches for you."

He then pulled Kelsey into the kitchen.

Kelsey leaned against the stove, watching Jack wash the peaches. "The ten minutes are up."

Nancy was still dawdling outside.

Jack drained the peaches, peeled them, cut them into small pieces, and handed them to Kelsey. He glanced outside and said, "Give her a little more time. Her parents, Liam Wilso and Barbara Inome, were kind to me. I don't want to make this situation too unpleasant."

Kelsey picked up a piece of peach with a fork and put it in her mouth. The sweet taste spread across her taste buds, slightly lifting her mood. "What did her parents do for you?"

Kelsey couldn't understand what kind of kindness would make Jack so tolerant of Nancy.

Jack said, "I lost my parents when I was young. It was Liam and Barbara who adopted me, gave me a home, and supported my education."

Kelsey was stunned. Looking at Jack, she felt a strong sense of guilt and stood up straight. "I'm sorry, Jack. I didn't know."

"It's not your fault." Jack smiled. "I was planning to tell you at a suitable time, but I've been busy."

Kelsey knew Jack was an orphan but didn't know about his connection to Nancy's family.

Kelsey started to feel a bit guilty. "If that's the case, isn't it a bit harsh to kick her out?"

She indeed disliked Nancy, but she had to consider Jack's reputation. If word got out, wouldn't people say Jack was ungrateful?

Jack looked at Kelsey. "Do you want her to stay?"

###chapter 315  That Fast?

Kelsey was caught off guard and shook her head. "Nah, that's not what I meant."

Jack gave her cheek a playful pinch. "I get you."

Right then, Nancy showed up at the kitchen door, still in her PJs with a long coat thrown over them, dragging a suitcase. She'd seen the cute moment between Jack and Kelsey.

Nancy bit her lip. "Jack, I'm outta here. Sorry for all the drama. Ms. Jose, don't be mad at Jack. Even if I gotta crash on the streets, I won't bug you guys again."

Seeing that neither Kelsey nor Jack said anything, Nancy added, "I hope you two are happy. I'm leaving now."

As she turned, Nancy wiped away her tears.

The sound of the door opening and closing echoed. Nancy stood outside for a sec. Seeing no one coming after her, she gritted her teeth and started dragging her suitcase downstairs.

Kelsey listened to the noise outside and looked at Jack. "You gonna see her off?"

Jack replied sincerely, "Nope, I'm worried you're mad."

Kelsey chuckled and gave him a light punch on the shoulder. "I'm not mad. You said her parents were good to you, so you can't just let Nancy sleep on the streets. Tonight, get her a hotel room, and tomorrow I'll help her find a place."

"Alright." Jack nodded, put down the peach, and headed out.

Nancy was dragging her feet downstairs. It was super late, and she looked around, clueless about where to go.

After thinking for a bit, Nancy took out her phone and called Yannick Abbott, a rich guy she'd recently met.

As soon as the phone rang, Nancy put on a sweet smile, her voice sugary sweet. "Hey, Mr. Abbott."

But a sharp female voice came from the other end. "You tramp, what are you doing calling so late? Got no shame? Your parents only raised you; didn't they teach you how to be decent? Trying to seduce a married man? You're really making your parents ashamed!"

Nancy was stunned. She never thought Yannick's wife would answer.

While Nancy was getting chewed out, Jack came downstairs.

Seeing Jack, Nancy immediately reacted, quickly hung up the phone, and put on her pitiful look. "Jack, why'd you come down?"

Jack took out his car keys. "I'll take you to a hotel."

Then he grabbed Nancy's suitcase and headed to the car.

Jack opened the trunk and tossed the suitcase in, while Nancy stood there, watching him.

A moment later, they both got in the car and drove to the hotel.

The car ride was silent, with Jack focused on driving. Nancy glanced at him a few times, but he didn't react.

Unable to hold it in, Nancy started talking, "Jack, you really don't have to worry about me. I can find a place myself."

"If you could find a place, why'd you come to stay with me?" Jack replied coolly.

Nancy bit her lip and said softly, "You and Ms. Jose?"

Jack said, "We're dating."

Nancy lowered her eyes, looking bummed out, her voice even softer. "Ms. Jose comes from a good family; she's beautiful, rich, and graduated from a top school."

At the intersection, Jack stopped the car, still looking straight ahead. "I'm not with Kelsey for those reasons."

"I get it," Nancy said, "Ms. Jose is really gorgeous and has a great vibe. You'll be happy with her for sure."

Jack nodded. "Thanks."

The light turned green, and Jack hit the gas, moving forward.

Nancy felt super awkward. It seemed like no matter what she said tonight, Jack wasn't gonna budge. His attitude was colder than ever.

When they got to the hotel, Jack walked her up.

"I paid for three days. Stay here for now, and once Kelsey and I find you a place, you can move there," Jack said.

Nancy was taken aback. "You and Ms. Jose are helping me find a place? Jack, won't she be mad at you for helping me? Won't it cause problems between you two?"

"No," Jack replied without missing a beat, "Kelsey isn't that petty. It was her idea to help you out."

Nancy was speechless.

"I gotta go." Jack glanced at his phone and turned to leave.

Nancy instinctively took a few steps forward, urgently calling, "Jack."

When Jack turned around, Nancy rushed over and hugged him tightly.

Jack froze, and after realizing what was happening, he pushed Nancy away.

"Jack, thank you," Nancy said, standing on tiptoe to kiss Jack's shirt collar.

The next second, Jack shoved her away forcefully.

Then Jack left without looking back.

When Jack got home, forty minutes had passed.

Kelsey had already showered. She was wearing Jack's shirt, lounging on the sofa watching TV, and munching on a peach.

Hearing the door open, Kelsey immediately put down the fruit plate and rushed over. She jumped up, wrapping her legs around Jack's waist, clinging to him. Then she started kissing him.

Jack instinctively supported her hips, holding her, feeling her sweetness and passion. His cold heart seemed to ignite, gradually heating up.

Kelsey and Jack kissed from the door to the sofa.

In the heat of the moment, Kelsey reached to pull Jack's shirt, but felt something sticky.

Kelsey instinctively opened her eyes and saw a bright red stain on Jack's white shirt collar.

Kelsey asked, "What's this?"

Jack turned his head and was also stunned. Suddenly, the image of Nancy hugging him at the hotel flashed in his mind.

Kelsey read something from Jack's expression, and her enthusiasm instantly halved. "Is this Nancy's?"

Although it was a question, her tone was very certain.

Kelsey thought, 'If it wasn't Nancy's, whose could it be?'

Jack held her hand. "Kelsey, let me explain."

Kelsey lay beneath him. "Okay. Explain! I'm listening."

In this situation, Jack felt that no matter what he said, Kelsey wouldn't believe him. But he still had to explain; he couldn't let Kelsey misunderstand and hold a grudge.

Jack said, "After I took her to the hotel, she suddenly rushed over and hugged me."

Kelsey raised an eyebrow. "She hugged you, and you just let her? You didn't push her away?"

"I did push her away," Jack said helplessly, "The whole thing lasted only a few seconds. I really didn't notice this spot."

"A few seconds?" Kelsey's eyes sparkled. "Are you that quick?"

Jack was stunned. After a few seconds, he finally reacted.

Kelsey burst into laughter. She pinched his cheek. "I'm just messing with you. Since I agreed to let you take her, it means I trust you. Why are you so worked up?"

###chapter 316 The Knot in the Heart Remains

Jack's eyes were still all tense. He gave her a soft kiss on the cheek and said, "I'm not just nervous. I'm straight-up scared."

Kelsey looked confused.

Jack leaned in, scooped Kelsey up, and spun her around. His hand brushed her temple as he whispered, "Kelsey, every time I'm with you, it feels like a dream. It's so unreal. Since we started, I've been trying to wrap my head around us being together. But even now, it still feels like a fantasy."

Kelsey grinned. "You goof, this is real. We're really together. What's so unreal about that? You think I'm gonna turn into foam and float away like the Little Mermaid?"

Jack smirked and said something totally out of character, "If you did turn into foam and float away, could you take me with you?"

Kelsey touched his forehead, all serious. "No fever, so why are you talking crazy?"

Jack wrapped an arm around her waist. "I'm serious. Don't leave me, okay?"

Kelsey was taken aback. Jack looked so vulnerable right then.

She turned, hugged him tight, and pressed her cheek to his chest. "Don't worry. I'm sticking with you for life. I'm stubborn; even if you try to shake me off, you can't."

Jack's low chuckle reached her ears. He teased, "I can see that."

In the days that followed, the weather in Lakina was great.

After Charles died, all the Landon family assets went to Sebastian. Now, the Landon Group not only survived the crisis but also became the top company in Lakina. The folks who once kicked the Landon Group when it was down now came crawling back, all smiles and fake friendliness.

Sebastian wasn't the type to hold grudges, but he had his limits. He could overlook minor slip-ups, but he wouldn't work with anyone who had betrayed the Landon Group.

The Landon Group was thriving, and Isabella was living the good life.

After a lot of convincing from Sebastian, she finally agreed to hire a nanny to help with Sweetie.

Sebastian was swamped with work during the day, and with Nina's jewelry company just starting, Isabella had to juggle both, which was pretty exhausting. So getting some help was a smart move.

After breakfast, Isabella put Sweetie in the cradle and opened a design book.

Sebastian had mentioned that the nanny would come today.

Isabella had to go with Nina to class in the afternoon. To avoid looking clueless, she'd been cramming jewelry design concepts these past few days.

The doorbell rang. Figuring it was the nanny, Isabella put down her book and went to open the door.

"Isabella." A clear voice called out, and a slender figure stood at the door.

Isabella was stunned. "Siena?"

A suitcase was at Siena's feet. She was dressed simply, like a regular college student, with a thin face without makeup and her hair tied back, looking both slim and a bit worn out.

"Sebastian asked me to come," Siena said.

Isabella finally realized that the nanny Sebastian mentioned was Siena?

"Come on in," Isabella said, letting her in. While she poured some tea at the water cooler, she shot a text to Seb: [Did you hire Siena as the nanny?]

A few seconds later, Sebastian called her directly.

"Bella, do you have a problem with Siena?" Sebastian asked bluntly.

Isabella was taken aback. "No, I don't."

She didn't really have any strong feelings about Siena. They'd only met a few times. To her, Siena was just some random person.

Even though Siena was Anna's adopted kid and Sebastian's sister in name, Isabella didn't feel any particular way about her.

Sebastian explained, "I thought it through before deciding to keep her around. She's been in some remote place for years, suffering for me, all for revenge. She played a part in dealing with Charles. Plus, I wouldn't feel right sending her back to some remote place. Bella, if you're not cool with it, I can ask her to leave."

Isabella bit her lip. "Deep down, you still want to see her as your sister, right?"

Sebastian had been carrying around this hatred for years, and now that he'd gotten his revenge, Isabella felt like he wasn't really satisfied. Since Charles's death, Sebastian had been having restless nights.

Isabella knew Sebastian was still troubled.

But now, his trouble had shifted to Anna.

When he got the DNA report, Sebastian realized he'd been hating the wrong person for years, which hit him hard.

Maybe now, Sebastian just wanted to do something to make himself feel better.

If having Siena around could help with that, it was worth it.

Thinking this over, Isabella said, "Since Siena is your sister, having her as our nanny to take care of Sweetie might not be the best idea."

Sebastian replied, "Don't worry about that. Siena came to me and asked to stay."

Isabella said, "She can stay, but being a nanny seems a bit off."

Sebastian said, "Siena's strong-willed. She doesn't like asking for help. Doing something she can handle makes her feel better. Let her be."

Isabella thought for a moment. "Alright."

After hanging up, Isabella brought tea and some sliced fruit to the living room.

The living room was quiet. Siena sat on the sofa, leaning slightly over the cradle, looking at the sleeping Sweetie with a gentle expression.

Isabella walked over. "Have some tea."

Siena looked up. "Isabella, will my being here cause you any trouble?"

The question felt a bit forced, but considering Siena was Sebastian's sister, Isabella didn't overthink it.

Isabella shook her head. "No. If you want to stay, that's fine. But you don't have to take care of our kid."

Siena lowered her eyes and bit her lip lightly. "Isabella, I don't want to go back to some remote place. I want to stay and be useful. I don't have much education, and I'm not particularly skilled. I can only do some basic work. I know you and Sebastian are super busy. If I can help out, it would be my way of repaying Anna and Sebastian for their kindness. It would also make me feel useful."

###chapter 317  Such an Absurd Plot

Siena spoke from the heart, and Isabella saw a bit of her old self in her. Insecurity and timidity were not innate traits; they were actually caused by a lack of a sense of security.

"Don't say that. Everyone's got their own gig and mission. You're still young, so anything can be possible. Don't sell yourself short," Isabella reassured her.

But Siena just shook her head and touched her belly gently. "I'm already like this. What possibilities are there?"

Seeing that, Isabella's heart skipped a beat. "You haven't gotten rid of the baby yet, have you?"

Siena was carrying Charles's kid, which Sebastian wanted to use to mess with Charles. Now that Charles was gone, the kid wasn't needed anymore. But from the look on Siena's face, she wasn't planning on getting rid of it.

Siena said, "Isabella, I want to keep this baby."

For a moment, Isabella was speechless.

Seeing Isabella's reaction, Siena cautiously asked, "Do you think I'm crazy and hopeless? I was gonna get rid of the baby, but then I had this dream. I saw a little boy holding my hand, crying, begging me not to leave him."

Isabella said, "That was just a dream, Siena. If you keep this baby, have you thought about your future?"

"No, I haven't," Siena admitted, "I was abandoned by my parents, Isabella. No one gets how I feel. This is a life, and I'm his mom. How can I abandon him?"

Isabella was at a loss for words.

Siena pleaded, "Isabella, don't laugh at me. I just can't do it."

After a moment of silence, Isabella asked, "Does Sebastian know about this?"

Siena's face changed. "Not yet."

Isabella said, "You need to tell him. Sebastian's your brother, after all."

As soon as Isabella finished, Siena dropped to her knees. "Isabella, please. Don't tell Sebastian. If he finds out, he'll make me get rid of it. I don't want to lose my baby!"

Isabella said, "But if you do this-"

Before Isabella could finish, Siena cut her off, "Isabella, please, don't tell Sebastian. If you think it's not good for me to stay here, I can leave. I can go back."

Isabella was speechless.

She helped Siena up and said, "Alright, I won't tell him for now. But you need to really think about whether having this baby is the best thing for you."

"Okay. Thank you, Isabella." Siena cried, tears streaming down her face.

Isabella looked at her and shook her head.

Isabella only agreed to keep Siena calm, but she had already decided to tell Sebastian about it.

In the morning, Isabella and Siena took Sweetie out for a walk. Isabella also took Siena to a nearby supermarket. After getting familiar with the route, they bought some fresh meat and veggies. Siena cooked lunch.

After eating, Isabella gave Siena a thumbs up. "I underestimated you. Didn't think you could cook this well. It's as good as Nina's."

Siena said shyly, "I only know a few simple dishes. I'm glad you like it, Isabella. I can't compare to Nina."

Isabella said, "You're being too modest."

As they were chatting, Nina showed up.

As soon as Nina walked in, she made a beeline for Sweetie and scooped her up from the cradle. "Sweetie, let me see you."

Isabella sighed dramatically. "Looks like I'm getting replaced."

Nina shot her a look and laughed. "You're a grown-up, and you're competing with a baby? Seriously?"

Isabella walked over and clung to Nina's arm. "No matter how old I get, I'm still your sister. You can't play favorites. Even though Sweetie is my daughter, I still get jealous."

Nina just shook her head, smiling.

Then she noticed Siena and did a double-take. "Who's this?"

Nina had never met Siena before; this was their first encounter.

"Oh, this is-" Isabella started to introduce her, but Siena stepped forward. "Hi, Nina. I'm Siena Scott."

"Siena?" Nina looked her over, remembering Isabella had mentioned over the phone last night that they were hiring a nanny. Nina assumed Siena was the nanny and said, "Isn't she a bit young for this?"

Nina pulled Isabella aside and whispered, "She's really pretty. Are you sure you want to leave Sweetie with such a young and attractive girl? Plus, with men in the house, hiring a young nanny could be risky."

Isabella realized Nina had misunderstood and quickly clarified, "No, she's Sebastian's sister."

Nina asked, "The Landon family only has two sons. Matthew is dead. Where did this sister come from?"

Isabella explained, "She was adopted by Sebastian's mom, Anna. They share the same last name."

Nina was still puzzled. "Even if she's Sebastian's sister, she's not a biological sister. It could still cause issues."

Isabella sighed. "I trust Sebastian. He wouldn't do anything. Besides-"

She paused and added, "Siena is pregnant with Sebastian's brother's child."

Nina was utterly confused and couldn't make sense of the relationships.

Siena stood not far away. Isabella said, "I can't explain it all right now. I'll fill you in later."

Then Isabella turned to Siena and said, "Nina and I have classes this afternoon. I've asked Laura to come over and help you with Sweetie."

Leaving Sweetie with Siena alone made Isabella uneasy, so she talked to Sebastian and arranged for Laura to help out.

Just then, Laura rushed in.

She was carrying several bags. "I came in a hurry and bought some small gifts. Hope you don't mind, Mrs. Landon."

Isabella helped her put the bags down. "Not at all. That's very thoughtful of you."

When Laura saw Sweetie, her eyes lit up. "She's adorable."

Isabella asked, "Do you want to hold her?"

"Sure," Laura said, reaching out but then pulling back. "I just came in from outside. I need to wash my hands and sanitize first."

Laura then hurried to the bathroom.

Isabella couldn't help but laugh.

Afterward, Isabella left Sweetie with Siena and Laura and headed out with Nina.

Nina had driven herself and was dressed pretty formally today. Isabella noticed that Nina had really transformed and now had the vibe of a designer.

"Stop teasing me," Nina said as she drove, "Tell me more about this Siena."

###chapter 318 The Gentlemanly and Elegant Quentin

Isabella stood there, scratching her head, totally lost on where to even begin.

Nina jumped in, "You said Siena is Sebastian's sister, but now she's knocked up by Sebastian's brother? What the heck is going on?"

Isabella shrugged, "Oh, that's easy. Siena's got Charles's baby."

Nina's jaw dropped. "What? She's so young and already messed up like this?"

Isabella just sighed. It was really Sebastian who was the one messing things up.

If Sebastian hadn't been so hell-bent on getting back at Charles, he wouldn't have pushed Siena to get close to him.

It was a total mess. Siena's story was like a bad soap opera.

"Man, that's rough," Nina said, shaking her head.

"Yeah," Isabella agreed. "Even you feel bad for her. If you were in my shoes, you'd probably do the same thing I did."

Nina shot her a look. "I trust you and Sebastian, but that Siena chick? Be careful. Don't let her take advantage of you."

Isabella nodded. "Yeah, I got it."

They dropped the subject and moved on.

The designer class was set up in some fancy performance hall.

By the time Isabella and Nina got there, most of the seats were already taken.

The guy at the door asked for their entry badges. Isabella was like, "Entry badges? What?"

She turned to Nina, "Do you have a ticket?"

Nina nodded, "Yep."

She handed it over, and the guy pointed to a round badge on the ticket. "This one."

Turned out, it could be detached and pinned to your chest.

"Nina, let me help you with that." Isabella carefully pinned it on Nina and said, "Looks awesome!"

Nina smiled and asked the guy, "Can we go in now?"

The guy nodded but then looked at Isabella. "Where's your badge?"

Isabella was speechless. She didn't have one.

Nina said, "Didn't they say one ticket gets two people in?"

The guy shook his head, "Too many people today, and you guys are kinda late. We gotta control the crowd to keep the class quality up. So, sorry, Ms. Miller, you can go in, but your friend can't."

Nina pleaded, "Can't you make an exception? She's my sister. We don't mind sharing a seat."

The guy was firm, "Sorry, rules are rules. No exceptions. Hope you understand."

Nina looked bummed out.

The guy added, "Class is starting soon. If you don't go in now, we're closing the doors."

Isabella gave Nina a little push. "Go on in. I'll wait outside. Take good notes and fill me in later."

Given the situation, that was the only play.

Nina nodded and hurried inside.

As the door shut, Isabella found a spot to sit and texted Laura to check on Sweetie.

Laura replied: [Sweetie's doing great. Don't worry. I've got her covered.]

She even sent a bunch of short videos.

In the clips, Sweetie was all smiles, kicking her little legs.

"Such a cute kid, is she yours?" A deep voice came outta nowhere, right by Isabella's ear. She got so spooked, her phone slipped from her hand.

A hand shot out from the side, catching the phone just before it hit the ground.

Isabella turned and saw who it was. "Mr. Black?"

"You remember me?" Quentin grinned, handing her the phone.

Isabella nodded. "Thanks."

"Did I scare you?" Quentin asked, his deep eyes locked on her face.

"Yeah, you did," Isabella admitted.

Quentin looked surprised, then laughed. "My bad. Didn't realize you were so into it."

"It's cool." Isabella put her phone away. "Guess I was too focused."

She hadn't even noticed someone sneaking up on her.

"What brings you here?" Quentin asked, "You here for the class too?"

"Yeah. Came with Nina, but I don't have a badge, so I'm stuck out here."

Quentin nodded. "Wanna get in?"

Isabella's eyes lit up. "You got a way?"

"Yep." Quentin nodded, heading towards the elevator and pressing the button.

Isabella followed him, glancing at the door Nina had gone through. "But Nina went in that way."

"I know." The elevator arrived, and Quentin held the door open for her. "We're taking the VIP entrance."

Isabella raised an eyebrow. This guy was more connected than she thought.

The elevator went up one floor. Isabella followed Quentin out, their shoes sinking into the plush carpet. They could already hear the lecture.

Isabella looked around. "So this is the second floor."

The second floor had seats too, but they were few and all empty.

Clearly, in Lakina, no one had the privilege to sit in the VIP seats for Esme's class. Quentin was full of surprises.

"Have a seat." Quentin pulled out a chair, all gentleman-like.

Isabella sat down.

Their spot was perfect, right in front of the stage.

At that moment, the host was still talking.

Isabella smiled. "If I'd known I'd run into you, Mr. Black, I would've brought Nina with me."

The view here was way better than downstairs. Plus, it was quieter.

Quentin raised an eyebrow. "If there were too many people, I might not have brought them along."

Before Isabella could think more, thunderous applause erupted downstairs as the host announced, "Let's give a warm welcome to Ms. Stewart."

Seeing the hype, Isabella joined in the applause.

Amidst the clapping, a figure walked out from the left side of the stage.

It was a middle-aged woman, slender and tall, wearing a long dress with embroidered lotus flowers that shimmered under the lights. Her makeup was on point, her hair neatly done and pinned up.

As soon as Esme appeared, Isabella recognized her. "Isn't that..."

Quentin met her puzzled gaze and slowly nodded.

The highly anticipated lecturer on stage was the woman Isabella had recently saved at Blue Horizon Cafe, Quentin's mom, Esme.

"So she's Ms. Stewart!" Isabella suddenly felt a weird sense of fate.

###chapter 319  Nina's Unusual Behavior

"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Esme, your lecturer for today. Welcome to my class!" Esme's voice rang out, clear and confident, filling the room.

Nina, who had been clapping enthusiastically, suddenly froze.

Throughout the hour-long class, Esme only took a short break to show off some of her past work.

As the class wrapped up, people started getting ready to snap some photos.

Isabella stood up, leaned on the railing, and scanned the crowd but couldn't spot Nina.

"Where's Nina?" Isabella muttered to herself.

Quentin, standing behind her, chimed in, "You saved my mom last time, and I've been wanting to treat you to a meal to say thanks. You also mentioned we should hang out when your fiancÃ© gets back. When's good for you?"

Isabella remembered saying that, but with everything going on lately, it had slipped her mind.

Quentin was now a shareholder in the Landon Group, and Esme was Nina's favorite teacher. This dinner seemed unavoidable.

"How about tomorrow night? My fiancÃ© and I can make it work," Isabella suggested.

"Sounds good," Quentin agreed, "I'll wait for your message."

Just then, Isabella's phone rang. It was Nina, asking where she was.

Not wanting to reveal she had watched the whole class from the VIP section, Isabella decided to keep it vague. "I'll be right there," she said and hung up.

After saying goodbye to Quentin, Isabella took the elevator down.

As soon as she stepped out, she saw Nina by the floor-to-ceiling window, staring at the falling sycamore leaves, lost in thought.

Isabella walked over.

Nina snapped out of it but looked a bit off. She grabbed Isabella's hand and said, "Let's go home."

"Nina, why are your hands so cold?" Isabella asked, squeezing her fingers.

"I'm fine," Nina smiled, but it was clear she was distracted.

Once in the car, seeing Nina's state, Isabella decided to drive herself.

Nina didn't object. She leaned back in the passenger seat, deep in thought.

After a while, Isabella asked, "How was the class?"

Nina paused, "It was just okay."

If Isabella hadn't been there, she might've believed her. But she had attended the whole class and found it fascinating. She couldn't believe Esme's class would be "just okay" to someone like Nina, who loved design.

"Just okay?" Isabella questioned.

Nina shrugged, "I was in the last row, so it was pretty average."

Isabella thought that during tomorrow's dinner, she could find an opportunity for Nina. Maybe Esme could even give her a private lesson.

"Same time tomorrow? I can come with you again," Isabella offered.

Nina shook her head, "I have something to do tomorrow, so I might not make it. You should stay home and take care of Sweetie. If I come, I'll let you know."

Isabella glanced at Nina. Something was definitely off. Before the class, Nina had been so excited, even bringing extra pens for notes.

Isabella thought, 'How could Nina be so down after just one class?'

That night, Isabella did some digging online about Esme.

What she found blew her mind. Esme was a design prodigy, racking up prestigious awards left and right. She was a big deal in the design world. Plus, her students weren't just in jewelry; top dogs in various fields had learned from her.

Isabella thought, 'Esme's a real heavyweight. If Nina can learn from her, she's set for life.'

Isabella filled Sebastian in on the dinner plans for tomorrow night, and Sebastian wasted no time booking the best spot in Lakina.

"There's something else I need to tell you," Isabella hesitated but decided to spill the beans about Siena.

Sebastian asked, "What is it?"

Isabella replied, "It's about Siena."

A sudden knock on the door cut her off.

Siena's voice came through, "Isabella, I need to talk to you. Can you come out for a sec?"

Isabella opened the door. "It's late. What's up?"

Siena peeked into the room and then whispered, "I need to talk to you. Can you come out for a moment?"

"Okay." Isabella closed the door and followed Siena to her room.

Siena was staying in a room on the first floor that used to be empty. The room was lit, and the bed was a bit messy. Once inside, Isabella asked, "What's the matter?"

Siena closed the door, walked to the bed, and lifted the blanket. Isabella's eyes widened at the sight of a red patch on the sheets. "You're bleeding?"

"Yeah." Siena looked flustered, one hand on her abdomen. "Isabella, my stomach hurts. Could something be wrong?"

"Bleeding during pregnancy is definitely not good." Isabella was nervous. This was serious. "I'll call Sebastian to take you to the hospital."

Siena grabbed Isabella's arm. "But I don't want Sebastian to know. Can you come with me?"

"Why?" Isabella was confused. "Bleeding during pregnancy is no joke."

Siena said, "I know. I'm scared so I called you. I feel like I might lose this baby."

Isabella said, "If you can't keep it, then you can't. Siena, as I said before, you really need to think carefully about whether to keep this baby."

Siena said, "Alright. Isabella, my stomach hurts a lot. Can you take me to the hospital? Don't tell Seb; I don't want him to know." Siena pleaded, her face almost devoid of color.

Isabella hesitated but finally nodded. "Okay, I'll get the car keys. Wait for me in the yard. It's chilly at night, so wear a coat."

"Okay. Thank you." Siena let go of her hand.

Isabella went upstairs, where Sebastian was playing with Sweetie.

Isabella walked over and said, "I'm heading out for a bit."

Sebastian looked up. "Where to?"

Isabella answered, "Siena needs some daily necessities, so I'm going with her to grab some."

Since Isabella said so, Sebastian didn't press further.

"Okay." Sebastian nodded. "By the way, what were you going to tell me earlier?"

###chapter 320 Threatened Miscarriage

Isabella hit the brakes, Siena's pleading face flashing in her mind.

Whether Siena could keep the baby was a big question mark. If she couldn't, the baby would have to be aborted anyway. If Siena could keep it, telling Sebastian later wouldn't change a thing.

Thinking this way, Isabella said, "It's nothing. I just think Siena, such a young girl, is surprisingly meticulous. She's taking good care of Sweetie."

"Yeah." Sebastian nodded. "She's had no one to rely on since she was little, so she had to handle everything herself. Being thorough is one of her skills."

Isabella drove straight to the hospital and got Siena an emergency appointment.

After the doctor checked her out, he said, "It's a threatened miscarriage."

Siena's face went pale, and she quickly asked, "Doctor, is my baby okay?"

The doctor said, "For now, it's okay, but you already have symptoms of bleeding. Bleeding at this stage means the embryo isn't implanting well. Given your current situation, this pregnancy is very risky. I suggest you terminate it. Of course, if you want to try to keep it, you'll need medication and must be very careful with your lifestyle. If you experience bleeding again, come to the hospital immediately, or it could endanger your own life!"

Siena bit her lip hard. After a long pause, she said, "Prescribe the medication."

Isabella was shocked. "Siena?"

Siena said, "Isabella, give me some time. At least I need to say a proper goodbye to this baby."

Siena's resolve was firm, and Isabella couldn't say much. She accompanied Siena to get the medication and went home together.

After they got home, Siena took the medication, changed the bed sheets, and sat on the edge of the bed with her phone. "Isabella, I've already scheduled the abortion for next week. Look."

Siena handed over her phone, and the screen indeed showed the appointment time for next week.

Isabella asked, "Are you sure?"

"Yeah." Siena nodded, her smile tinged with sadness. "You're right, this baby probably shouldn't stay. Since I can't keep it, I should send it off properly. Maybe it's destined."

Isabella comforted, "Siena, don't be too sad. You're still young, and you have a long road ahead. You're such a good girl; you'll definitely meet a man who will love you wholeheartedly and be happy."

Siena smiled. "I hope so."

It was already late at night. Richard turned over, reaching out to an empty space.

He suddenly opened his eyes, sat up in bed, and scanned the room, seeing Nina standing on the balcony, lost in thought.

Richard turned over and got out of bed, striding over. He opened a blanket and wrapped it around Nina, pulling her into his arms. "Why are you up so late? What are you watching?"

Richard's house was on a hillside, some distance from Emerald Isle City. At night, it was silent all around, with nothing visible except for the faint lights in the distance.

"Nothing." Nina leaned into his embrace. "I just couldn't sleep and wanted to clear my head with some fresh air."

Richard looked down at her. "Was today's class not going well?"

"It went well," Nina answered simply.

Nina had something on her mind, but she was clearly reluctant to share it with him.

Richard didn't press her. He just held her quietly, keeping her company as they enjoyed the breeze.

Nina was startled. She turned around in Richard's arms and realized he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt, his legs and arms exposed to the cold.

She quickly spread the blanket over his shoulders.

Richard squinted his eyes, his big hand wrapping around her waist, pulling Nina tight against him. "It's cold!"

Nina hugged him. "Let's go back inside?"

"Yeah." Richard scooped her up with one arm, and once inside the bedroom, they tumbled into bed.

After some late-night shenanigans, Nina finally crashed in the early hours.

"Child, child?" In a daze, someone was calling her.

Nina opened her tired eyes to see a beautiful, thin face. "Child, wake up?"

Nina looked at the face and murmured, "Esme."

A sudden, urgent phone ring pierced through Nina's dream.

Nina opened her eyes, her consciousness slowly pulling away from the dream. She rubbed her aching temples, found her phone, and answered, "Hello."

Isabella's voice came from the other end. "Nina, are you going to class this afternoon?"

Nina closed her eyes, feeling a slight twitch in her temples. "I have some stuff to handle this afternoon, so I won't be going."

Isabella said, "Oh. Do you have time tonight? Want to grab dinner together?"

Nina replied, "Sure."

Isabella said, "I'll send you the address later. Come with Richard tonight."

Nina agreed. "Okay."

After hanging up, Nina couldn't fall back asleep. But she didn't get up immediately either, just lay in bed, her mind wandering aimlessly. There was a knock on the door.

Nina pulled her drifting thoughts back and called out, "Come in."

The door opened, and a servant stood at the entrance. "Ms. Miller, breakfast is ready. Will you eat here or come down?"

"I'll come down," Nina said, getting out of bed and tying her hair up to wash.

The servant paused and added, "Ms. Black is here."

Nina paused.

The servant lowered her eyes. "She's in the living room downstairs."

Nina blinked. "Got it. Entertain her for now; I'll be down shortly."

"Yes, Ms. Miller." The servant nodded and closed the door.

Speaking of Elodie, Nina felt a headache coming on.

The first time they met, Elodie had her kidnapped.

Although there was a close call and Richard ultimately rescued her, since that day, Elodie has occasionally shown up to assert her presence.

Richard's attitude towards Elodie was always lukewarm, not overly respectful but cautious enough not to offend her.

Nina guessed that Elodie was probably Bruno's daughter, and since Richard worked for Bruno, he naturally didn't dare to offend Elodie. Richard didn't like her, so he could only keep his distance. However, keeping his distance didn't seem to work for Elodie.

Nina didn't want to cause trouble for Richard, so she treated Elodie with cold politeness.

However, if Elodie dared to bully her, she would fight back.

When Nina went downstairs, Elodie was sitting in the dining room, having breakfast the servant had made. She only took one bite of each item before throwing the spoon into the bowl and sharply commenting, "Disgusting!"

The servant stood nearby, barely daring to breathe, looking aggrieved.

Hearing footsteps, Elodie looked over. The moment her sharp gaze landed on Nina.

Nina calmly met Elodie's gaze, sat down at the table, glanced at the disturbed breakfast, and instructed the servant, "Clear it all away. Just make me a bowl of mac and cheese."

"Okay, Ms. Miller." The servant hurriedly stepped forward to clear the dishes.

But at that moment, Elodie coldly said, "Don't clear it!"

###chapter 321 Richard

The servant hesitated but still went ahead to clear the dishes.

Even though Elodie was scary as hell, this was Richard's crib, and the servant was on Richard's payroll to look after Nina. In this mess, the servant knew who to back and naturally chose to listen to Nina.

"I said don't clear the table; are you deaf?" Elodie snapped, her anger flaring up.

The servant acted like they didn't hear and kept clearing the dishes.

Elodie suddenly stood up, grabbed a nearby fruit knife, and slashed at the servant's arm.

The blade cut through the servant's flesh, dishes crashed to the ground, and the servant screamed in pain, clutching her injured arm and backing away.

Elodie's moves were quick and ruthless, no hesitation at all.

Nina was also freaked out by the sudden scene. She quickly stood up, walked over to the servant, pulled her behind her, and sternly questioned, "Ms. Black, what the hell are you doing?"

Elodie still held the blood-streaked fruit knife in her hand. Seeing Nina and the servant's faces, instead of feeling any guilt or fear, she laughed triumphantly. "Now you fear me? What were you doing before? The thing I hate most is being treated like I don't exist. Well, looks like it takes a bit of bloodshed for you to recognize my power."

"Unbelievable!" Nina didn't want to argue with her and turned to take the servant to see a doctor.

Elodie dashed over, brandishing the fruit knife, its blade grazing dangerously close to Nina's nose.

"You're not going anywhere!" Elodie glared at Nina's face, wishing she could slash it if not for Richard.

Nina sneered. "Ms. Black, are you out of your mind?"

"If you dare to leave, I'll cut her again!" Elodie threatened, turning the knife towards the servant once more.

"Ms. Black!" Nina shouted angrily.

Elodie's knife hovered in the air, just inches from the servant's eye.

The servant, realizing the danger, collapsed to the ground in fear.

Elodie sneered and kicked the servant, cursing, "Idiot!"

Nina knew it would be hard to shake off Elodie today.

Elodie was gunning for her, and Nina didn't want to drag others into it. Nina knew Elodie wouldn't harm her but was using the servant to vent her anger.

Nina asked, "Ms. Black, what do you want?"

Elodie said, "It's simple. Sit down and finish your breakfast."

Nina looked at Elodie. "You've already eaten from every dish."

Elodie said, "So what? You like leftovers, don't you? Stop acting all high and mighty. Don't you know Richard used to date me? Since you like leftovers so much, I'll let you have your fill. Eat this, and I'll let this lowly servant go!"

Nina frowned, keeping her cool. "Ms. Black, I don't care about your past with Richard. He's a person, not an object. You said it yourself, that's in the past, so stop clinging to it. I don't like leftovers, and Richard isn't one. He's a good man, worthy of love. I won't touch anything you've eaten, not even a single bite. If you think you can humiliate me this way, it's pointless!"

Elodie didn't expect Nina, who seemed so weak, to say such things, especially with a knife pointed at her. Elodie was furious. "Fine, since you're so carefree, I'll just kill this lowly servant."

With that, Elodie bent down, grabbed the servant's collar, and the fruit knife in her hand gleamed coldly.

Nina said, "Ms. Black, murder is punishable by death!"

Elodie paused, sneering. "What, you think I can't kill a servant?"

She couldn't harm Nina, but killing someone close to her to vent her anger was a good option.

Nina pointed upwards. "There are cameras everywhere. If you dare kill her, I'll call the police immediately. No matter who you are or how powerful, you must obey the law. Ms. Black, you're just an ordinary person like us. Your advantage is only having a powerful family and father backing you."

Elodie sneered, dismissing Nina's words. "You think I'm afraid? If you don't let me kill, I'll do it just to show you. This person didn't have to die, but because you infuriated me, she must die today, right in front of you. Remember, Nina, she died because of you!"

With that, Elodie yanked the servant's hair, forcing her face upward, and raised the fruit knife high, aiming for the exposed neck.

The servant's pupils dilated in fear, her body limp, unable to resist.

"No!" Nina screamed, rushing forward to grab the knife from Elodie's hand.

The blade cut Nina's wrist, causing sharp pain, but it didn't stop Elodie. The knife still aimed straight for the servant's neck!

In a split second, something flew past Nina's ear.

The fruit knife was struck, making a dull sound. Elodie's arm went numb, and she lost her grip on the knife, which fell to the ground.

Footsteps approached from behind, and Richard walked in with a cold, murderous aura.

Elodie called, "Richard."

Before Nina could react, Elodie had already rushed over, throwing herself into Richard's arms.

Richard, without hesitation, grabbed Elodie's arms and peeled her off like removing trash. He didn't even glance at Elodie, walking straight to Nina, pulling her into his arms, and looking at her carefully. Seeing the wound on Nina's wrist, Richard's expression turned icy.

Richard called, "Michael!"

Hurried footsteps sounded at the door, and Michael rushed in with a medical kit.

Placing the kit on the dining table, Michael quickly took out the supplies to treat the wound.

Richard had Nina sit in a chair and began treating her wound.

Michael, meanwhile, had his men carry the fainted servant out.

Elodie watched the scene unfold, stomping her feet in fury. "Richard, is this woman the only person you ever see?"

###chapter 322 Treating Guests

Richard totally ignored Elodie and kept on patching up Nina's hand with all the care in the world.

His moves were super gentle.

Elodie's eyes were green with envy. She strutted over and shoved her hand in Richard's face. "Hey, my hand's hurt too. Why don't you care about me?"

Michael glanced over and chuckled. "Ms. Black, that's just a red mark, not even a scratch. You call that an injury? Maybe you gripped that fruit knife too hard. And you're the one who caused the harm. Even if you were really hurt, you got no right to whine."

Elodie spun around and shot daggers at Michael.

Michael just smirked and gave her a cheeky grin.

Elodie could only glare back.

Richard found Elodie super annoying and swatted her hand away. "Elodie, I've warned you. Seems like my words don't mean squat to you. If that's the case, let's make it more concrete. Michael."

Richard ordered, "Take Ms. Black to the first casino for a few days."

Michael's face shifted a bit, but he didn't move right away. Instead, he looked at Elodie.

Elodie got the hint instantly. "Richard, are you seriously gonna lock me in the dungeon?"

"Richard." Michael seemed like he wanted to say something, but Richard's look shut him up.

Michael knew Richard well, and he knew Elodie too. He got that if Elodie didn't get a lesson, Nina wouldn't have any peace. As for the fallout of locking Elodie up, he trusted Richard had a plan. He said to Elodie, "Ms. Black, let's go."

Elodie snapped, "I'm not going! Richard, how dare you lock me in the dungeon? If my dad finds out..."

"I'll personally apologize to Mr. Black," Richard cut her off coldly.

In the end, whether Elodie liked it or not, Michael took her away.

"What's the dungeon?" After Michael and Elodie left, Nina asked, "Is it literally a dungeon?"

"Yep." Richard said as he bandaged Nina's wound. "It's a place for locking up folks who mess up."

Even though Richard made it sound chill, Nina knew it wasn't that simple. She grabbed Richard's hand and said worriedly, "Are you really gonna lock Elodie in there? How will you explain it to Mr. Black? She didn't really do anything to me; it's just a minor cut."

Richard pulled Nina's hand closer and said seriously, "If it had been a bit deeper, it would've hit a vein! You call that nothing?"

Nina tried to pull her hand back. "It's really not that bad. Shouldn't you think it over?"

Richard looked at Nina. "Think over what?"

Nina said, "Let Elodie go this time."

Richard said, "If I let her go this time, there'll be a next time. Nina, I want you to feel safe and secure with me, not scared. If I can't even protect you, what right do I have to be by your side?"

Nina said, "But..."

Richard cut her off, "No buts. I know Elodie; she needs a wake-up call. I've warned her a bunch of times, but she doesn't take it seriously. So I gotta make her remember," Richard said, gently hugging Nina, "Don't worry. I know what I'm doing."

"Alright," Nina nodded.

Even though she still had her doubts, she couldn't deny Richard had a point.

Nina said, "By the way, are you free tonight? Bella wants to have dinner with us. She already made the reservation."

Nina showed her phone to Richard.

Richard glanced at it and frowned a bit. "Anyone else coming?"

Nina said, "Bella mentioned a shareholder from the Landon Group, the one who bought Nathaniel's shares."

Hearing this, Richard got the picture. He held Nina's hand and said, "Perfect, I also want to introduce you to a couple of people tonight."

Night fell fast.

Isabella and Sebastian were the first to show up since they were hosting and didn't want to keep the guests waiting.

Sebastian had some desserts and juices brought out for Isabella to enjoy first.

Soon after, Nina and Richard arrived.

Nina and Richard were pretty much inseparable now, which made Isabella happy.

Nina and Isabella sat on the couch chatting, while Richard and Sebastian exchanged a look and sat down at the tea table.

Sebastian poured tea for Richard and said casually, "Thanks for last time."

Richard glanced at him and replied just as casually, "No biggie."

After that, they went quiet.

Richard and Sebastian sipped their tea in silence, both watching Nina and Isabella chat, each lost in their own thoughts.

Soon, footsteps echoed outside, and a hotel staff member walked in. "Mr. Landon, the guests have arrived."

Sebastian stood up and walked over, with Richard following after a beat.

Isabella's eyes lit up, and she quickly pulled Nina along.

Quentin was the first to walk in, exchanging a few pleasantries with Sebastian.

Behind Quentin was the internationally renowned jewelry designer, Esme.

Isabella watched Nina closely, and sure enough, Nina's face showed shock and a mix of emotions when Esme appeared.

"Ms. Miller, we meet again." Esme looked warmly at Isabella.

Nina instinctively frowned when she heard the word "again".

Isabella seemed very pleased. "I didn't expect you to be the famous designer, Esme. I must have been blind."

Esme smiled gently. "Don't let this title make you distant from me."

"Of course not." Isabella said, pushing Nina forward and introducing her solemnly, "This is my sister, Nina Miller. She's a big fan of yours. We attended your lecture yesterday."

"I know." Esme turned her gaze to Nina and extended her hand calmly. "Why didn't you come today?"

Nina stiffly extended her hand and shook Esme's. "Something came up unexpectedly."

"Design is three parts intuition and seven parts talent. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me," Esme said.

Nina's eyes flickered. "We have no connection. Why would you help me?"

Esme smiled. "You're Isabella's sister. Of course, I'll take special care of you."

Hearing this, Nina looked at Isabella, confused.

Esme turned her gaze to Richard. "I heard you locked Elodie up?"

Her words brought silence to the room.

Nina's heart skipped a beat, and she looked at Richard uneasily.

Sebastian stayed calm, like he already knew Esme and Richard were acquainted.

The most surprised was Isabella.

###chapter 323  The Gift

Richard dropped his gaze, losing that usual cocky vibe. "Yeah, Mrs. Black."

Isabella was taken aback. She'd dealt with Richard enough to know he was too full of himself to bow down to anyone. But here he was, acting all obedient in front of Esme.

Even though Isabella didn't have all the details, she could tell Esme was a big deal.

Quentin chimed in calmly, "Got any idea how you're gonna explain this to Mr. Black?"

Richard shot back, "I'll take the heat."

Quentin just nodded and kept quiet.

Esme jumped in, "Elodie's been getting more and more full of herself lately. I know she's been a pain for you. If this can knock her down a peg, it might be a good thing. But Richard, tread carefully. Even if I let it slide, I can't promise Mr. Black will."

Richard nodded. "Got it. Thanks, Mrs. Black."

With that, everyone grabbed a seat.

As soon as Esme sat down, she waved Isabella over. "Isabella, come sit with me and chat."

Isabella nodded. "Sure thing."

Since Esme was the guest of honor tonight, Isabella naturally listened to her.

Esme asked, "Did you catch my lecture yesterday?"

"Yeah, I went with Nina." Isabella always made sure to drop Nina's name, trying to keep her in the loop.

Meanwhile, Nina was unusually quiet, sitting off to the side, lost in her own world. Isabella thought she seemed a bit out of it.

"So, what'd you think of my lecture?" Esme asked.

"It was awesome," Isabella said earnestly. "Your design work is top-notch, and your presentation was on point. Even as a newbie, I was hooked."

"Really?" Esme smiled warmly. She took Isabella's hand and checked out her wrist. "You've got lovely hands. I brought you a little something today that I think you'll like."

With that, Esme pulled out a fancy square brocade box from her bag. She popped it open to reveal a stunning gold bracelet.

The bracelet had intricate filigree work, lush enamel, and a few vibrant gemstones. The design was unique, way classier than anything you'd find in stores.

Isabella immediately recognized the pattern in the filigree. "Is that a hibiscus flower?"

"Yep." Esme looked at her warmly. "The hibiscus stands for purity and elegance. I hope you can be as pure and flawless as the hibiscus. Do you like it?"

Isabella was a bit taken aback. "I love hibiscus flowers, but this bracelet is too much. I can't accept it."

"You saved my life once. To me, this is just a trinket. If you don't take it, I'll be really bummed," Esme said, slipping the bracelet onto Isabella's wrist.

Seeing the bracelet onto Isabella's wrist, Esme smiled. "My taste is spot on. This design is perfect for you."

Isabella's slender, fair wrist looked stunning with the bracelet on.

Isabella said, "But it's too valuable."

Quentin cut in, "You should totally take it. After last time, my mom's been racking her brain on what to give you. She designed and made this bracelet herself. She spent nights sketching it out and even more time perfecting the details. Finally, she crafted it herself. It's not about the money, but if you don't take it, it'll really break her heart."

"You made it yourself?" Isabella was floored.

Knowing Esme's rep in the jewelry world, Isabella got how priceless a piece designed by her was.

The bracelet felt heavy on Isabella's wrist.

Suddenly, Nina stood up and said, "Bella, come with me to the restroom."

Isabella nodded and followed.

In the restroom, Nina stood in front of the mirror, washing her hands, looking all troubled.

"Nina, what's up?" Isabella had noticed Nina acting weird and was worried she might be feeling off.

After washing her hands, Nina dried them with a paper towel. Glancing at the bracelet on Isabella's wrist, Nina frowned slightly. "Have you met Esme before?"

Isabella replied, "Yeah, we met once at Blue Horizon Cafe."

Isabella had nothing to hide from Nina and spilled the beans about what happened that day.

After listening, Nina's frown deepened.

Isabella sighed. "I only found out about her identity yesterday. She's an international jewelry designer. Small world, huh?"

"I don't think it's a small world; it seems deliberate," Nina replied.

Isabella was puzzled. "What do you mean by deliberate?"

Nina looked at Isabella seriously, placing a hand on her shoulder. "It's nothing."

Isabella felt that Nina had something on her mind. But for some reason, Nina didn't share it with her.

Back in the private room, Nina seemed much calmer and quietly finished her meal.

Throughout the meal, Nina didn't mention wanting to find a teacher.

However, as Esme was leaving, she said to Nina, "Remember to attend my class tomorrow."

A dark light flashed in Nina's eyes, and she nodded. "I'll be there on time."

After seeing Esme and Quentin off, Isabella said, "Nina, should I go with you tomorrow?"

Nina pressed her lips and said, "Richard is free tomorrow. He said he'd go with me. Bella, you also have a lot to do. Stay home and spend time with Sweetie tomorrow."

Isabella nodded. "Alright then."

It was clear that Nina was dodging something. But since she didn't want to talk about it, Isabella didn't want to push her and add more pressure.

Back home, Sweetie was still awake, lying in her pink cradle. Siena sat beside her, holding a picture book and reading softly.

Isabella picked up Sweetie, who giggled.

"Let me hold her." Sebastian came over and extended his hands.

Isabella handed Sweetie to him and then leaned in to kiss Sweetie's cheek. Sebastian kissed Sweetie's other cheek.

Siena stood nearby, looking out of place. When she saw Sebastian holding Sweetie, she instinctively bit her lip and placed a hand on her abdomen.

Isabella turned her head and noticed Siena's odd behavior, but with Sebastian there, she didn't ask.

After a while, Sebastian said, "Let's have Sweetie sleep with us tonight."

"Okay." Isabella nodded.

Sebastian took Sweetie to the master bedroom, while Isabella lagged behind, asking Siena, "Does your stomach still hurt?"

###chapter 324 Forgot to Lock the Door

"No, after popping that pill, the pain's gone," Siena said, but Isabella could still tell something was off with her.

Isabella chimed in, "Hey, I'm free next week. Let's hit up the hospital together."

Siena's eyes got all teary. She was super touched and grabbed Isabella's hand. "Thanks, Isabella."

Isabella, feeling a bit awkward, pulled her hand back. "No problem."

From outside, Sebastian's voice called out, "Bella?"

"Coming!" Isabella shouted back. She turned to Siena and said, "Gotta go. Tonight, we'll handle Sweetie. You've been busting your butt all day, so get some rest."

"Alright, I'll tidy up Sweetie's crib and then crash," Siena said, bending down to fix the crib.

Isabella felt a pang of sympathy watching her. Just as she was about to say something, Sebastian walked in holding Sweetie. "Isabella, I've been calling you forever. What's up?"

"Nothing." Isabella turned away and walked off with Sebastian.

As soon as they left, Siena straightened up and walked to the door. She leaned against the doorframe, quietly watching them leave, her nails digging into the wood.

The next morning, before Isabella even opened her eyes, she heard Sebastian's steady voice mixed with Sweetie's cooing.

Sebastian said, "Sweetie, I'm Daddy."

Sweetie responded, "Ah."

Sebastian said, "Say Daddy."

Sweetie responded, "Mm."

When Isabella opened her eyes, she saw Sebastian lying on his side in the warm, hazy morning light, gently pinching Sweetie's cheeks and patiently teaching her to say "Daddy."

Sebastian said, "Come on, say Daddy."

"Wow." Sweetie wriggled a bit, her tiny fist softly hitting Sebastian's nose.

Sebastian was speechless.

Isabella couldn't help but laugh out loud. Almost instantly, Sebastian looked up, showing a helpless expression. "Isabella, look at Sweetie. Such a tiny kid, and she's already hitting me!"

Isabella sat up and teased Sweetie, "Sebastian, aren't you being a bit childish?"

The next second, Sebastian grabbed her hand and pulled her over, making her lie on his chest.

Sebastian took the opportunity to lift Isabella's chin and kissed her on the lips, his voice husky. "How about we do something not so childish?"

As soon as he finished speaking, Isabella was pulled into the covers, and Sebastian's passionate kisses followed.

Isabella pushed him away. "Sebastian, Sweetie is still here!"

Then Sebastian picked up Isabella and walked to the sofa.

He pressed Isabella into the sofa, and a wave of irresistible tenderness ensued.

"Sebastian," Isabella panted, unable to resist Sebastian's advances. She could only cling softly to Sebastian, her whole body heating up under his touch.

"Bella," Sebastian's fingers interlocked with Isabella's, their clothes almost completely off. Sebastian's eyes were filled with desire. He kissed Isabella repeatedly, his voice gentle as he called her name over and over.

Isabella's lust was ignited by Sebastian. She reached out, wrapped her arms around his neck, and offered her lips.

Her initiative nearly drove Sebastian wild.

Sebastian's palm gripped Isabella's waist tightly, pressing her close. In the heat of the moment, Sebastian said, "Bella, Bella, I love you."

Isabella said, "I love you too, Sebastian."

Just as Isabella was ready to embrace everything, a sudden noise came from the door, followed by the sound of something hitting the floor.

Isabella whipped her head around and saw Siena standing there, looking like a deer caught in headlights. Her hands were still up, eyes wide as saucers.

In that moment, Isabella felt her blood rush to her head, almost paralyzing her.

Sebastian was quicker on the uptake. Almost as soon as Isabella turned to see Siena, he grabbed a blanket and threw it over her.

Sebastian frowned and barked at Siena, "Get out!"

Siena stood there, stunned for a few seconds, then bolted out of the room.

The door slammed shut, startling Sweetie, who had been quietly sucking her fingers, and she suddenly started wailing.

Isabella pushed Sebastian away, quickly walked to the bed, and scooped up Sweetie to calm her down.

Sebastian walked over and draped the blanket over her shoulders. "My bad, I forgot to lock the door."

Isabella felt a bit embarrassed but still defended Siena, "She didn't mean to. I think Siena's pretty timid; don't scare her."

Sebastian paused for a moment before nodding. "Alright."

After that, they headed downstairs for breakfast.

Siena was originally in the dining room, but when she saw them coming down, she quickly ducked into the kitchen.

Taking the chance to grab a spoon from the kitchen, Isabella said to Siena, "You okay?"

Siena kept her head down, looking guilty. "I'm sorry, Isabella. I really didn't mean to. I thought Sweetie should be up by now, and I was worried you were still sleeping, so I wanted to check."

It's super awkward for a couple to get caught like that by someone else. But seeing Siena so remorseful, Isabella didn't want to scold her further. "Next time, can you knock before coming in? That way, we can avoid these awkward moments. Right?"

Siena nodded. "You're right! I'll definitely knock next time! I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

"Alright," Isabella said, "It's cool now."

Siena bit her lip, still looking worried. "What about Sebastian?"

Isabella said, "It was an honest mistake. He won't hold it against you. Just make sure it doesn't happen again."

Siena nodded. "Okay."

After breakfast, Sebastian headed to work.

Isabella had no plans for the day, but then Nina called, asking for her help to check on some stuff at the company.

It was mostly about some renovation details. Nina had classes today and couldn't make it, so she asked if Isabella could go and oversee things.

Isabella agreed. She called Laura, and after Laura arrived, she went to the company.

But as soon as Isabella got to the company, Laura called, "Isabella, come back quick!"

Hearing the urgency in Laura's voice, Isabella was taken aback and asked, "What's wrong?"

Isabella thought, 'I've only been out for like half an hour.'

She could faintly hear Sweetie crying. Laura said, "I can't explain it over the phone. Just come back quick."

Isabella guessed that Sweetie might be feeling unwell, so she quickly said, "Okay, I'm on my way."

After hanging up, Isabella drove back in a hurry.

When Isabella parked the car, Laura was already waiting at the door.

Isabella jogged over and asked from a distance, "What happened?"

###chapter 325 Be More Cautious

Laura's face was all kinds of weird. She peeked into the room and said, "You ask her."

Isabella strolled in and saw Siena clutching Sweetie on the couch. Siena's face was a mess of tears, and she was biting her lip, looking all kinds of guilty.

Sweetie had stopped bawling and was just lying there, all quiet in her arms.

As soon as Isabella got close, Siena dropped to her knees with a loud thud, sobbing like there was no tomorrow. "Isabella, I accidentally dropped Sweetie!"

"What?" Isabella was floored. She quickly scooped Sweetie into her arms, her hands shaking like crazy.

Laura, standing nearby, chimed in, "I have no clue how she was carrying her; she just tripped out of nowhere. Sweetie went flying; her head almost hit the corner of the wall. Luckily, the blanket was thick enough to break the fall."

Just hearing that made Isabella's heart race.

Isabella thought, 'Kids are so fragile at this age, especially their heads. If Sweetie had really hit her head, it could've been a disaster!'

Isabella shot Siena a hard look.

Siena was already a wreck, crying her eyes out, looking pale and speechless.

Laura reminded, "You should take the kid to the hospital for a check-up!"

Isabella said, "Alright. Laura, can you drive us to the hospital?"

Laura nodded, "Sure thing."

The two headed out the door, and Siena followed. "Isabella, I'll go with you!"

Isabella glanced at Siena, feeling a bit sorry but still firm. "Siena, stay home. Laura and I will take the kid."

Siena wanted to say more, but Isabella didn't give her the chance. She got into the car with Sweetie and left without looking back.

As they got closer to the hospital, Laura asked, "Should we call Mr. Landon?"

Isabella thought for a moment and said, "He's got a big meeting today. Let's get Sweetie checked first."

Laura nodded. "Okay."

At the hospital, after checking Sweetie, the doctor said, "No visible signs of swelling or bruising, and the kid seems pretty calm. Looks like she didn't hit her head. Keep an eye on her at home, and if anything seems off, bring her back right away!"

Hearing that, Isabella let out a big sigh of relief.

On the way back, with Laura driving, Laura asked, "Should we call Mr. Landon now?"

Isabella thought of Siena and hesitated. "No, I'll tell him tonight."

Laura thought it over and realized Isabella had a point.

This was better talked about face-to-face rather than over the phone. So she didn't push it.

After a bit of silence, Laura said, "By the way, the nanny you hired is so young. She clearly doesn't know how to take care of a kid. Just because the kid is small doesn't mean they don't need proper care. If something goes wrong, it could be really bad. You and Mr. Landon should think about hiring a new nanny."

Siena's situation was kinda unique; aside from a few family members, no one knew about the deep connection between Siena and the Landon family. Laura just assumed Siena was a nanny hired by Isabella and Sebastian.

Seeing Isabella stay quiet, Laura thought for a moment and asked, "Is Siena not a nanny?"

Isabella didn't want to spill the beans to Laura, so she smoothly changed the subject.

Realizing Isabella didn't want to talk about it, Laura didn't push further. But she couldn't help but add, "Isabella, I don't know why, but I've always found Siena a bit off."

"A bit off?" Isabella's heart skipped a beat, but she kept her cool. "Like, how?"

"I can't really put my finger on it," Laura said, struggling to find the right words. "Just be careful. She's an outsider, and when it comes to the kid, you can't be too cautious."

Isabella stared out the window, her gaze deepening. "Yeah. What happened today can never happen again!"

After dropping Isabella off at home, Laura took off.

When Isabella walked in with Sweetie, Siena was at the door, reaching out to take Sweetie, but Isabella instinctively pulled back.

Siena froze, then retracted her hand. She bent down to grab slippers from the shoe cabinet and quietly placed them at Isabella's feet.

Seeing Siena's cautious behavior, Isabella felt a pang of sympathy. She put on the slippers and walked in. "The check-up went well. Sweetie is fine."

As soon as Isabella finished speaking, Siena started to tear up.

Siena seemed scared to cry out loud, quickly wiping away her tears as they fell.

Seeing Siena like this, Isabella felt awful. "Siena, I've thought it over. I'll take care of the kid myself from now on."

Siena looked up, shocked. "Isabella, are you blaming me? I swear I didn't mean for this to happen. I don't know how I tripped. I get how you feel, but I really love Sweetie. Can you let me keep taking care of her? I promise this won't happen again."

Isabella shook her head firmly. "I'm sorry, Siena. I can't trust your promise. This is my daughter, and I can't gamble with her life."

Isabella continued, "Don't beat yourself up too much. I believe it was an accident. But I can't take that risk. Siena, I hope you can understand."

The moment Isabella heard that Sweetie had fallen, she was terrified. It was pure luck that Sweetie was unharmed. If something had happened to Sweetie, Isabella would never forgive herself and wouldn't deserve to live.

Siena sobbed uncontrollably.

Isabella stood up. "I'll take Sweetie upstairs to rest. I'll call you if I need anything."

Isabella didn't want to be too harsh on Siena, but Sweetie was her bottom line. Whether Siena's actions were intentional or accidental, Isabella couldn't get past it. The only thing she could do was to ignore Siena for now and calm herself down.

Isabella stayed upstairs with Sweetie all morning. Near lunchtime, Sweetie started crying.

Isabella tried to soothe her but had no luck. She guessed Sweetie was hungry.

As she was about to head downstairs to make formula, there was a knock on the door. When she opened it, she found Siena standing outside.

Siena held a bottle of freshly made formula, handing it over. "Sweetie always drinks milk at this time. I made it, and it's the right temperature."

Isabella took it. "Thanks."

Noticing Siena's red, swollen eyes and the bandage on her wrist with blood seeping through, Isabella was startled. "Siena, your wrist?"

Siena quickly covered it, avoiding eye contact. "It's nothing. Lunch is ready. Come down and eat when you're ready. I'll go now."

As Siena turned to leave, Isabella hastily grabbed her, pulling away the hand covering her wrist. The loosely wrapped bandage fell off, revealing a large burn.

The wound was fresh and still bleeding, clearly a recent injury. From Siena's expression, it was evident she had done it to herself.

Isabella was shocked.

###chapter 326  Does She Hate Me?

"Isabella, it's all on me. Today's mess is totally my fault. I know I can't fix it, no matter what I say," Siena muttered calmly, staring at the floor.

Isabella's eyes widened. "But you can't just hurt yourself like this!"

Siena sighed, "Isabella, this is the only way I can feel a bit better. Don't stress; it's got nothing to do with you. This is my way of punishing myself."

Isabella was at a loss for words. Just as she was about to speak, Sweetie started bawling again.

Isabella rushed to calm Sweetie down. Siena glanced over and said, "I'll head downstairs. Holler if you need anything."

Isabella watched her leave, feeling all kinds of conflicted.

After Esme's class wrapped up, she invited Nina to a nearby cafÃ©.

Once they were seated, Esme handed the menu to Nina. "Not sure what you like. Pick whatever. It's on me."

"You choose," Nina pushed the menu back. "I'm not into coffee."

Esme raised an eyebrow. "Most folks your age are all about coffee."

She ordered two mild coffees anyway.

Nina looked at Esme and said, "I'm kinda old-school, not big on new stuff. Isabella and I are pretty similar that way."

Esme nodded. "With how fast things move these days, a lot of people just go with the flow and lose themselves. You and Isabella have done well to stay true to yourselves."

"Aunt Esme," Nina said, "after all these years, can I still call you that?"

Esme smiled. "Of course. Nina, you've changed a lot. Honestly, when I first saw you, I almost didn't recognize you." She looked Nina over, noticing the weariness in her eyes, despite her being only in her thirties.

Esme continued, "You've taken good care of Bella all these years; she must've had a stable life."

Nina's lips tightened, emotions bubbling up. "Stable? There's no stability like being with your parents. I couldn't give Bella much, and she's been through a lot with me. Whenever I was about to give up, I'd think, if Aunt Esme hadn't left Bella, would our lives have been easier?"

Esme's fingers tightened around her spoon. She sighed. "In the end, I owe Bella."

Nina lowered her eyes. "Talking about owing is pointless. Aunt Esme, I gotta ask; did you come to Lakina to take Bella back?"

"Yeah," Esme nodded, finally voicing the question that had been on her mind for ages. "Does she hate me?"

Nina said, "I don't know. When she was little, she always asked where her parents were. I told her they were working out of town. As she got older, she stopped buying it. Eventually, she probably figured out the truth and stopped asking. It wasn't until recently that I told her everything."

Esme's eyes were filled with emotion. "I had my reasons back then; I had no choice but to leave her."

Nina asked, "So why didn't you come back to find us all these years?"

Esme's eyes got misty. She looked down, trying to pull herself together before saying, "I'm sorry; I had my reasons."

Nina shot back, "So you think that when you had your reasons, Bella had to just suck it up? And now that you want her back, she should just welcome you with open arms? Aunt Esme, life doesn't work like that. Bella's kind, but she knows what's right and wrong. Do you think a simple excuse can make up for all these years and clear you of all responsibility?"

Esme was too ashamed to respond.

Nina took a deep breath. "You hurt Bella once; don't do it again."

Esme called out, "Nina."

Nina stood up. "I'll cover the coffee. I won't be at your class tomorrow."

With that, Nina walked out of the cafÃ©.

Esme sat there for a moment, then picked up her already stirred coffee and took a few sips.

Leaving the cafÃ©, Nina felt a bit unsettled.

Though she had spoken harshly, she knew Esme wouldn't give up easily.

What Nina was most worried about was Bella.

So Nina didn't go back to the Jose family. After calling Margaret, she drove straight to Sebastian and Isabella's place.

After playing with Sweetie for a bit, Nina took Isabella's hand. "Didn't you hire a nanny? Why haven't I seen her?"

"She's not feeling well, so I let her rest," Isabella said. "How was your class today?"

Nina replied, "Just okay."

"What do you mean, just okay?" Isabella asked, "Esme's classes are so awesome; you must've learned a lot. I think if you had Esme as your teacher, you'd create amazing designs."

"I can design great stuff without a teacher," Nina said, her tone a bit defiant, even a bit bratty.

Isabella was a bit surprised. She teased, "I didn't know Nina was so capable."

"Yeah, I'm very capable," Nina said, gently pinching the back of her hand. "Otherwise, how could I have raised you?"

Isabella leaned against Nina's shoulder. "That's right. Nina is the best sister in the world!"

Isabella said, "Nina, I believe in you. You can do it!"

Nina turned her head. "What about you?"

Isabella asked, "What do you mean?"

Nina's gaze fell on the bracelet on Isabella's wrist. "What do you think of Esme?"

"She's great," Isabella answered almost without thinking.

Nina frowned. "You've only met her a few times, and you think she's great?"

Isabella said, "Even though we haven't met much, I feel a sense of closeness whenever I see Esme. I even thought, if I had such a beautiful and capable mom, it would be wonderful!"

Nina's eyes froze. "What if she really is your mom?"

Isabella turned, sensing something off in Nina's expression. She hugged Nina's arm. "I don't want a mom; I just want my sister. Nina, don't be mad. I was just joking."

"I know," Nina said seriously, "Bella, if one day your mom suddenly shows up and wants to take you back, what would you do?"

###chapter 327 No Answer

Isabella mulled it over for a sec and said, "Nah, that ain't happening."

Nina was like, "Why not?"

Isabella shot back, "Think about it. She ditched me back then and never bothered to come back. That means she doesn't give a damn about me. She probably forgot I even exist, so why would she come looking for me now?"

Nina pressed, "But what if she does come back?"

Isabella was stumped.

She snapped, "What's with you today? Why all these weird questions?"

Nina just grinned. "No reason, just felt like asking."

Isabella shrugged. "Never crossed my mind."

"Then don't sweat it." Nina pulled her into a hug. "My bad for bringing it up."

"It's cool." Isabella forced a smile.

In fact, Isabella had thought about it, more than once. But she never found an answer.

Isabella wondered, 'If she really showed up, what would I do?'

She absentmindedly fiddled with the bracelet on her wrist, lost in thought.

From that day on, Nina was practically glued to Isabella, even dragging her to the office. After a few days of this back-and-forth, Nina got fed up and decided Isabella and Sweetie should crash at the Jose place for a bit.

Isabella was caught off guard by Nina's sudden plan. "Whoa, that's a bit sudden. I gotta talk to Sebastian."

Nina handed her the phone. "Talk to him now."

Isabella thought, 'Nina's got that boss vibe down pat.'

The call connected, and Sebastian's voice came through. "Nina, what's up?"

Isabella put the phone to her ear. "It's me."

When Sebastian heard about the plan, he didn't mind but said, "Just make sure to pack some clothes for me too."

Isabella was speechless.

So, she packed a few sets of clothes and headed downstairs with Nina.

Downstairs, Siena was just coming back with bags of groceries. Seeing the Jose family driver with the luggage, she was stunned. "Isabella, not staying for lunch?"

Isabella said, "I'm crashing at the Jose place for a few days, Siena. No need to cook for us; just take care of yourself."

Siena was puzzled. "You guys?"

Isabella nodded. "Yeah, Sebastian's coming too."

Disappointment flickered in Siena's eyes. "How long you staying?"

Isabella shrugged. "No clue."

Nina urged, "Bella, let's roll."

Isabella replied, "Alright."

She reminded Siena, "When's your appointment? I'll go with you."

"Tomorrow," Siena said, "You don't have to come. I can handle it."

Isabella insisted, "No way. I promised, so I'll be there. See you at the hospital."

"Okay." Siena bit her lip, watching Isabella leave.

The Jose family gave Isabella and Sebastian a warm welcome. Margaret even had the servants prep the biggest guest room for them.

Isabella felt weird about sharing a room with Sebastian in someone else's house, so she suggested bunking with Nina.

Nina was totally cool with it.

But that meant Sebastian was flying solo.

"I'll bunk with Sweetie then," Margaret chimed in with a grin.

From the moment they walked in, Margaret had been glued to Sweetie, not wanting to let go.

"This kid is just adorable," Margaret gushed.

Everyone was chilling in the living room, chatting away. Margaret kept nudging Sweetie towards Zaire.

Zaire glanced at Sweetie and shrugged, "Aren't all babies the same?"

Margaret shot him a look. "No way! Sweetie is extra cute, super chill, and just so soft. She's special."

Zaire sighed, "Alright, alright, if you say so." He didn't have the energy to argue, so he just went with it.

But Margaret wasn't letting him off that easy. She plopped Sweetie into Zaire's arms. "You hold her."

Zaire freaked out, "Can you take her back?"

As he said that, everyone in the room turned to look at him.

Sebastian's eyes narrowed. "What did you just say?"

Margaret smacked Zaire on the head. "It's a blessing to hold her. Don't be ungrateful!"

Zaire wanted to snap back, "Do you want this blessing?"

But he knew Margaret would just say, "Of course I do, only a fool wouldn't!"

Zaire realized Margaret really wanted grandkids and was hoping he'd get on it.

Even Steven was grinning, "Zaire should hold kids more often."

"Exactly," Margaret agreed, "Sebastian, you should hang out with Zaire more and rub off on him. If he had half your drive, I'd be happy."

Sebastian looked at Zaire with a smirk and said, "Yeah, he's definitely lacking in that department."

Zaire glared at Sebastian.

Then, out of nowhere, Sweetie spit up on Zaire.

Zaire was stunned!

But everyone else just watched, like Sweetie had spit gold instead of milk!

Just as Zaire was about to lose it, Miley stepped in.

"Sweetie, come here," Miley said, taking Sweetie from Zaire.

Zaire bolted upstairs to shower.

Seeing this, Margaret gave a nod to a servant.

The servant got the hint and headed to the laundry room. A moment later, she came back with some clean clothes.

Margaret called her over, "Are those Zaire's clothes?"

The servant nodded. "Yes, Mrs. Jose."

"Bring them here." Margaret handed the clothes to Miley. "Miley, could you take these up to him?"

Margaret's intentions were clear as day. Everyone got it, and so did Miley.

Miley handed Sweetie to Margaret, took the clothes, and smiled. "Sure, Margaret. I'll take them up."

"Go ahead," Margaret said with a smile, "No rush to come back down. You two can chat for a bit."

Miley blushed.

In the room,Â after showering, Zaire realized there was nothing in the bathroom, not even a dry towel!

Usually, the servants had everything ready. But today, there was nothing.

Zaire frowned and walked out of the bathroom naked, bumping right into Miley.

###chapter 328 Time to Renew

When Zaire saw Miley, he didn't freak out or anything. He just raised an eyebrow, all chill. He was standing there butt-naked, water still dripping from his hair.

Miley was shocked at first, but then she got her cool back. She gave him a once-over, twice, and then her eyes landed on a certain part of him. She clicked her tongue, like, "Hmm."

Zaire was like, "Seriously?" under her stare.

Miley lifted her chin. "Clothes are on the bed. Margaret told me to bring 'em."

Zaire didn't budge. "Where?"

Miley sighed, "On the bed."

Zaire was like, "I don't see 'em."

Miley rolled her eyes. She knew Zaire was just being a brat. He'd been spoiled since forever, so his little tantrums were no biggie. Plus, she kinda liked indulging him.

She walked over to the bed, bent down to grab the clothes, and Zaire swooped in, grabbed her wrist, and flipped her onto the bed.

Zaire asked, "What was that tongue click about?"

Miley blinked. "You want the truth or a lie?"

Zaire got closer, his fingers under her chin, pressing firmly. "What do you think?"

Miley smirked. "The lie is you're too big."

Zaire asked, "And the truth?"

Miley said, "The truth is you've gotten smaller."

Zaire's face darkened. His fingers pinched her chin, eyes flashing dangerously. "Say that again?"

Miley raised her hand, pinched a tiny distance with her fingers, and gestured. "Just a little bit."

Zaire stared at her, his expression tight. "Miley, you trying to piss me off?"

Miley's eyes sparkled with mischief, clearly teasing him.

Zaire felt a rush of heat. His hand moved down, exploring under her skirt, roughly caressing her skin as his breathing got heavier. "Miley, you really know how to push my buttons. Whether I'm small or not, we'll see by how loud you scream."

Zaire lowered his head and bit her earlobe. "Later, don't cry and beg for mercy."

Miley's eyes were seductive as she kissed him passionately.

But just when Zaire was about to lose it, she suddenly pushed against his chest.

Zaire looked at her, eyes blazing with desire. Being stopped, he seemed a bit annoyed. "What's up?"

Miley curled her red lips, her nails lightly tapping his chest. "Mr. Jose, it's time to renew your subscription."

Zaire kissed her fiercely. "Renewed!"

"But," Miley tilted her head, "I don't want to do this anymore."

Zaire asked, "What do you mean?"

"Exactly what it sounds like." Miley's eyes sparkled. "Mr. Jose, I want to be your girlfriend."

Zaire chuckled, thinking she was joking. "Miley, come on."

He leaned in to kiss her again, wanting to shut her up with a kiss. But Miley turned her head, dodging him. "Mr. Jose, I'm serious."

Zaire went silent. He stared at her for a moment, then rolled off her, sat at the edge of the bed, and started getting dressed.

A hint of hurt flashed in Miley's eyes. She slowly sat up and began to fix her clothes.

Zaire glanced back at her, his brows furrowed, looking impatient. "Get out!"

Miley just smiled and didn't say a word. She got up and walked out. At the door, she paused and turned back to Zaire. "Mr. Jose, hit me up when you've made up your mind."

Then she closed the door and left.

Listening to her footsteps fade away, Zaire scratched his head in frustration. He looked down at his lower half and gritted his teeth, heading to the bathroom for a forty-minute cold shower.

Isabella came out of the shower to find Margaret holding Sweetie and chatting with Nina.

Seeing Isabella, Nina got up and walked over, touching her hair. "Let me dry your hair."

Isabella sat down at the vanity, casually applying some skincare products, while Nina stood behind her, blow-drying her hair. Through the mirror, Isabella could see Margaret playing with Sweetie.

As long as Nina blow-dried Isabella's hair, Margaret played with Sweetie, showing endless patience.

Nina turned off the hairdryer and smiled. "Looks like Mom's really taken a shine to Sweetie."

Just as Nina finished speaking, Sweetie let out a giggle.

Isabella felt a bit emotional. "Yeah, Sweetie would love having a grandma like Margaret."

Isabella thought, 'Who wouldn't want a complete family? But I had no parents growing up. Grandparents are even a luxury for Sweetie.'

Margaret said, "Bella, if you don't mind, I can be Sweetie's grandma from now on. I'll treat her like my own granddaughter."

Nina added, "Yeah, Bella. I've got your back. The Jose family is your family. We're all your family."

Isabella's eyes grew moist. As she wiped her tears, she said, "Can you guys not be so mushy? You know I'm a crybaby."

Nina gently hugged Isabella, her eyes full of concern. "Bella, we're serious."

Isabella said, "Yeah, I know. Thank you. Thank you, Margaret. With you guys, Sweetie will definitely be very happy."

Margaret stayed until late. To let Isabella get a good night's sleep, she took Sweetie to her room.

Nina and Isabella lay side by side on a big bed, facing each other. They held hands and chatted until Isabella started to feel sleepy.

Isabella fell asleep, but Nina was still awake. She gently stroked Isabella's cheek, the stress of the past few days weighing on her. Now, with Isabella by her side, she relaxed and gradually fell asleep.

It was unclear how much time had passed when Isabella was awakened by the urgent ringing of the phone.

Nina turned on the light and handed her the phone. "Bella, it's for you."

"Oh." Isabella was still a bit groggy. She took the phone without checking the caller ID, pressed the answer button, and put it to her ear. "Hello?"

A worried female voice came from the other end. "Is this Isabella?"

Isabella replied, "Yeah, it's me."

The other end said, "This is Regional Medical. Do you know Siena?"

Isabella said, "Siena? Yeah, I know her."

The other end said, "She had a miscarriage and went into hemorrhagic shock. She's in the emergency room now. It's critical. You need to come over right away!"

Isabella instantly woke up. She sat up abruptly. "How did this happen?"

When Isabella finished dressing and went out, she ran into Sebastian.

Seeing Sebastian's expression, Isabella knew he must have gotten a call from the hospital too.

###chapter 329 Big-Hearted

The two exchanged a look. Sebastian strolled over, grabbed Isabella's hand, and said, "It's chilly out. I can handle this solo."

Isabella shook her head. How could she possibly sleep after something like this happened?

Isabella said, "I'm coming with you."

Sebastian nodded. "Alright."

When they hit the hospital, Siena was still in the ER.

A nurse handed Sebastian some forms to sign.

Isabella's eyes widened when she saw one of the forms mentioned removing a fallopian tube.

She asked, "What's this about? Why do they need to take out a fallopian tube?"

"Because the patient has an ectopic pregnancy that caused a ruptured fallopian tube and severe bleeding. To save her life, we must remove one of the fallopian tubes," the nurse explained.

Isabella was floored. "Ectopic pregnancy?"

Sebastian signed the forms without a hitch and handed them back.

Isabella bit her lip. The hospital at night had this eerie vibe that made her feel all kinds of uneasy.

She asked, "Sebastian, Siena's gonna be okay, right?"

Sebastian patted her back. "She'll pull through. Don't stress."

Isabella nodded but was still pretty worried.

All she could do was silently pray for Siena, hoping she'd be alright.

After what felt like forever, the light above the ER finally went out.

As the door swung open, Isabella and Sebastian rushed over. "Doc, how is she?"

The doctor said, "She's out of danger now. The anesthesia hasn't worn off yet. We'll get a nurse to take her to a ward."

Sebastian said, "Thanks."

As the hospital bed rolled out, Siena looked ghostly pale, lying there like she was out cold.

Sebastian glanced at Siena's face, which looked a lot like Anna's from his memories, and then looked away.

After a long night, when Siena woke up, the sky outside was already starting to brighten.

She opened her eyes and saw Isabella and Sebastian sitting by the bed.

Seeing Siena awake, Isabella stood up. "Siena, you're awake?"

Siena's eyes moved from Isabella's face to Sebastian's. She weakly raised a hand. "Sebastian."

Isabella noticed Siena's movement and froze for a sec.

But considering Siena had just woken up, Isabella pulled Sebastian over to the bedside.

Siena grabbed Sebastian's hand, tears streaming down her face and soaking the pillow. "Sebastian, it hurts so much."

Isabella was speechless.

Sebastian frowned, looking at Siena seriously. "Siena, you knew this baby couldn't be kept. I told you to handle it after everything was over. Why did this happen today? Don't you owe me an explanation?"

"I'm sorry, Sebastian." Siena sobbed.

Isabella couldn't bear to watch and quietly tugged on Sebastian's sleeve, signaling with her eyes for him to ease up.

Sebastian frowned, a dark look in his eyes. He turned to Siena and said, "I'll get you a nurse. Rest up in the hospital."

Siena immediately shook her head. "Sebastian, don't leave me alone. I'm scared."

"You're not alone," Sebastian said.

Sebastian continued, "The nurse will be with you."

Siena called, "Sebastian."

Sebastian said, "Siena, as an adult, you need to own up to your actions. Since you didn't listen, you gotta deal with the consequences!"

Siena bit her lip, tears soaking into the pillow.

Isabella didn't get a chance to say anything before Sebastian dragged her out of the room.

"Sebastian." Isabella tugged at him. "Isn't it kinda harsh to leave Siena like that?"

Sebastian turned to her, looking a bit annoyed. "What was that about pulling me over her just now?"

He stepped closer. "Dragging your husband over to hold another chick's hand. Bella, you got some guts."

Isabella was stunned for a sec before she got what Sebastian meant. "Siena's not some random girl; she's your sister."

Even though Isabella thought Siena's behavior was a bit off, she hadn't really overthought it.

"A sister is still the opposite sex," Sebastian said, exasperated. He held Isabella's hand tight and said sincerely, "Bella, can you be a little more sensitive and not too nice? At least with me, can you be a bit more possessive?"

Isabella laughed. "What's up with you? According to the usual logic, shouldn't I be the one getting jealous? Why are you the one getting upset?"

"Are you following the usual logic?" Sebastian said, frustrated.

Isabella was speechless.

As they were talking, a dull thud came from the room, followed by Siena's painful cries.

When they rushed back in, they saw Siena had fallen from the high hospital bed, dragging the blanket with her. The water cup on the bedside table was knocked over, and the IV was yanked out. Siena lay curled on the floor, clutching her abdomen in agony, her whole body shaking with pain.

Sebastian called the doctor, who came and treated Siena before putting her back on the bed.

But Siena was super uncooperative. She kept struggling even though she was in serious pain. "Let me down; let me go!"

Finally, the doctor gave her a sedative, and Siena calmed down.

But she still stared wide-eyed at the ceiling, tears streaming down.

Seeing Siena like this, the medical staff advised, "The patient is very emotionally unstable right now. It's best if a family member stays with her."

Sebastian frowned, staying silent.

Isabella looked at the sky outside and nodded. "Okay."

Sebastian turned to look at Isabella.

As daylight broke outside, the hospital started to get busier.

"Sebastian," Siena weakly called out.

Sebastian looked at her but didn't respond.

Isabella couldn't stand it and spoke up, "Siena, how are you feeling?"

"Much better. Isabella, I'm sorry for causing you trouble again. I always seem to be a burden." As she spoke, Siena's tears started falling again.

Isabella was speechless. She used to think she was fragile, but she hadn't expected Siena to be even more so. Siena's tears seemed endless.

Isabella said, "Siena, why didn't you tell me you had an ectopic pregnancy? If I had known earlier, I..."

"Isabella, didn't you already know?" Siena interrupted, blinking innocently.

Isabella was stunned, not immediately getting what Siena meant.

But Siena had already turned her gaze to Sebastian. "Sebastian, didn't you ask me before why I didn't abort the child? Actually, it was Isabella who encouraged me."

Isabella was completely bewildered.

###chapter 330 No Explanation Needed

Isabella finally got it. 'Siena's trying to pin this on me.'

Isabella was kinda shocked, not really getting why Siena would say that stuff. She didn't jump to defend herself but felt pretty bummed out.

Siena kept her eyes on Sebastian, spinning her tale. "Isabella told me I shouldn't give up on my kid as a mom. I had the surgery all set, but she made me cancel it. Sebastian, if you don't believe me, I've got the appointment record on my phone."

Sebastian just listened, not saying a word.

The room was dead silent.

Isabella started to freak out. "Sebastian, I never said that."

Sebastian glanced at her. "No need to explain."

Right then, the caregiver walked in. "Mr. Landon."

Sebastian gave a few instructions, basically telling the caregiver to look after Siena and left a number to call if anything came up.

He didn't ask about what Siena said, didn't give Isabella a chance to explain, didn't even look at her.

Isabella stood there, biting her lip. She suddenly felt someone staring at her. She turned and locked eyes with Siena.

Siena still looked all weak and fragile, but her eyes were full of challenge and triumph.

Isabella clenched her fists, thinking, 'I've been played by Siena!'

Just as she was about to step forward and confront Siena, Sebastian grabbed her hand and said, "Let's go."

Sebastian's calm voice made Isabella feel suffocated.

Leaving the hospital, a heavy feeling settled in Isabella's chest, growing worse by the second. It felt like a huge rock was crushing her heart, making it hard to breathe.

Sebastian opened the passenger door for her, and after she got in, he walked around and got in the driver's seat.

Isabella's eyes followed him. As soon as he sat down, she grabbed his arm.

Sebastian closed the door and looked at her, still calm. "What's up?"

Isabella bit her lip, feeling more and more upset. "Do you believe what Siena said? Do you think I caused all this?"

Sebastian stayed silent, a flicker of something in his deep eyes as he looked at her.

Isabella said, "I didn't say that to Siena. I only told her to end the pregnancy. That kid was conceived out of revenge and would never get any love. How could I be so cruel to tell her to keep it?"

She went on, "Plus, Siena had an ectopic pregnancy! In such a dangerous situation, anyone would tell her to end it. I'm no different."

But Sebastian stayed silent.

He didn't start the car; he just listened.

Isabella looked at him nervously. "Do you believe me?"

Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

Isabella felt hurt by his expression. She lowered her gaze and leaned weakly against the seat. "You believe Siena, right? I mean, who would joke about their own life?"

Isabella thought, "How could my words stack up against what Siena went through today? After all, she almost died. Her story's gotta be more convincing, right?"

Sebastian suddenly leaned over, grabbed Isabella's seatbelt, and buckled it. He stayed close, studying her face. "Now you're nervous?"

Isabella blinked, confused.

Sebastian said, "Weren't you all generous just now, pushing me towards Siena?"

Isabella mumbled, "I was pretty stupid!"

Sebastian gently pulled her into his arms, his lips brushing her face. He whispered near her ear, "Bella, you know what I love most about you?"

Isabella shook her head.

Honestly, she felt pretty ordinary, just a regular person. Compared to Sebastian, they were worlds apart.

She was just a small employee in the company, while Sebastian was the big boss.

Before joining the Landon Group, Isabella never imagined she'd get tangled up with Sebastian. But fate's funny like that; one night changed everything, leading to this endless mess.

Now, Isabella and Sebastian were tight.

"It's your kindness," Sebastian said. "I've seen so much of the world's filth and ugliness, and the cruelty of human nature. People will do anything to get what they want. I've become numb. But Bella, your kindness and purity have shown me beauty again."

Isabella felt a mix of emotions, a bit moved and a bit ashamed. "I'm not as good as you say."

Sebastian held her fingers, squeezing them one by one. "But Bella, in this world, being too kind isn't always good. You can be kind, but you need an edge. People will use your kindness to hurt you and those you care about."

Isabella's eyes flickered. "Do you believe what Siena said?"

"Silly!" Sebastian chuckled, his eyes full of affection. "Of course, I believe you."

Isabella asked, "You don't believe her?"

Sebastian replied, "No."

Isabella said, "Why? Siena's your sister, and she almost lost her life."

Sebastian's fingers brushed past her ear, his voice gentle. "I believe my wife."

Isabella's cheeks heated up, and she looked away, avoiding his eyes. "Who's your wife? If you believe me, why didn't you let me explain in the hospital, and why didn't you look at me?"

Sebastian said, "Bella, between you and me, there's no need for explanations."

Sebastian's words hit the softest spot in Isabella's heart.

Isabella thought, 'Yeah, after everything we've been through, what is there to explain?'

Sebastian said, "I've arranged everything. Once Siena recovers, someone will take her back to her hometown. Bella, I'll clear away any obstacles for you. You just need to move forward boldly."

Isabella thought of Siena and sighed softly.

As for Siena, she'd done all she could. Sebastian was right; Siena couldn't stay in Lakina, nor could she stay with them.

After staying at the Jose family for a few days, Isabella and Sebastian went back home.

Nina's company got busy, with lots of stuff to do. Isabella helped out at Nina's company during the day, and Sweetie was taken care of by Margaret. Everything seemed to have settled down, moving along smoothly.

###chapter 331: Injured

In the evening, Isabella had dinner at the Jose family's place and then drove Sweetie back home.

Just as she pulled up to the house, the car's headlights flickered, and she thought she saw something move in the trees.

Isabella parked, got Sweetie out, and stood there, staring into the shadows.

The streetlight gave off a warm glow, but the thick shadows under the trees made it hard to see if anyone was lurking. Still, Isabella was sure someone was there.

Sebastian wasn't home yet. Holding Sweetie, Isabella didn't want to get too close. Sweetie whimpered, and Isabella whispered to calm her down. Suddenly, there was a rustling sound from the shadows.

Isabella snapped her head up and yelled, "Who's there?"

No answer.

The spot where the noise came from was quiet again, like it was all in her head.

Isabella didn't dare to check it out, so she carried Sweetie to the door.

Just as she unlocked it, a hand landed on her shoulder.

Isabella screamed, swatted the hand away, and slammed her back against the door with a thud.

Quentin stepped back, surprised, and chuckled, "Do I look that scary?"

Isabella squinted. "Mr. Black?"

Still shaken, she looked around, confused. "What are you doing here?"

Quentin pointed to the nearby house. "I just moved in."

Isabella suddenly remembered seeing people moving stuff into the neighboring house the past few days. She'd noticed it a few times early in the morning and knew someone new had moved in, but she hadn't expected it to be Quentin.

"I just got back from a night run and saw you standing in the yard, so I thought I'd come over to say hi. Didn't mean to scare you. My bad," Quentin apologized sincerely.

Isabella exhaled. "It's pretty freaky having someone sneak up on you like that."

Isabella glanced at the shadows by the door, wondering if the person hiding there earlier was Quentin. But it didn't seem likely; Quentin didn't seem like the type to skulk around.

"You look pretty spooked," Quentin said, watching Isabella's face. Then he noticed her gaze and turned to look in the same direction. Seeing the dense shadows, he frowned slightly and walked towards them.

Isabella watched in alarm and instinctively called out, "Mr. Black."

Quentin turned back and smiled. "It's okay."

Then he walked straight to the edge of the yard.

Isabella watched as he disappeared into the darkness, feeling like it was swallowing him up, her heart pounding with worry.

But just a few seconds later, Quentin emerged from the darkness, holding a cat. It looked filthy, its eyes closed, lying limp in his hands, barely alive.

"This must be the noise maker," Quentin said.

He stroked the cat's fur, and when he lifted his hand, his palm was stained with red.

"It's hurt!" Isabella exclaimed.

Quentin nodded. "Got a first aid kit at home? I moved in a rush and didn't grab one. Mind if I borrow yours?"

Isabella said, "Sure thing, I'll grab it."

She went inside and came back with the first aid kit. Quentin had already laid the cat on the doorstep and was carefully checking out its wounds.

"Here's the kit," Isabella handed it over, then held Sweetie and squatted nearby to watch.

Quentin's hands moved skillfully, his fingers, with their well-defined joints, were both beautiful and precise. Without a hint of disgust for the dirty cat, he patiently parted the fur and finally found the wound on the cat's belly.

"Looks like it got cut by something sharp," Quentin said, taking medical scissors from the kit and trimming the fur around the wound.

When the wound was fully exposed, Isabella gasped. "That's a nasty cut! How did it get hurt like this?"

The wound was long and deep, with a thick scab running from its hind leg to its front leg. It was horrifying.

"It's man-made," Quentin said, standing up and unzipping his jacket, taking it off.

"Man-made?" Isabella was even more shocked, looking at the poor cat on the ground. "Can people really be that cruel?"

As soon as Isabella finished speaking, she saw Quentin lay his jacket on the ground, then gently lift the injured cat and place it on the jacket. His actions were so gentle, treating the cat with great care, unlike others who might have just ignored it.

Isabella was deeply moved by his behavior.

Next, Quentin cleaned the blood clots from the cat, washed the wound with antiseptic, and then retrieved a long needle from the medical kit. Threading it, he carefully and meticulously stitched the terrifyingly long wound together.

Isabella stood nearby holding Sweetie, who had fallen asleep in her arms.

After what felt like forever, the wound was finally stitched up. Then Quentin took some cotton gauze from the first aid kit and carefully bandaged the wound.

The cat was so badly hurt that it barely opened its eyes throughout the process, not struggling or crying out.

Isabella was worried. "Will it make it?"

Quentin sighed. "It's up to fate."

After finishing, Isabella noticed Quentin's hands were covered in blood and disinfectant, even his previously clean nails were stained.

But Quentin didn't seem to mind. After organizing the first aid kit, he closed the lid. "I'll take this first aid kit with me. I'll return an identical one tomorrow."

Isabella waved her hand. "No need."

Sebastian had a private doctor, Marvin, and getting another fully equipped first aid kit was a piece of cake.

Quentin smiled. "I insist. I don't like owing people favors."

In the deep night, Isabella and Quentin stood facing each other.

Then Quentin wrapped the cat in his jacket and held it in his arms. With the other hand, he picked up the first aid kit and nodded slowly at Isabella. "Until I find its owner, it'll have to crash with me for a few days."

###chapter 332 Jealousy

Isabella grinned and said, "Hanging out with you ain't exactly a chore."

After all, a guy like Quentin? He'd be a hit anywhere. And after seeing him save that cat, it was clear the furball was in good hands. He just had that vibe that made you feel safe.

Quentin gave her a long look and said, "I'll take the cat home. You should head back too. It's getting cold; don't stay out here with the baby."

Right then, Isabella felt a tickle in her nose and sneezed.

Catching Quentin's amused look, Isabella felt a bit awkward. "See ya."

Quentin nodded, watching her go inside before heading next door.

Suddenly, a rustling sound came from the shadows by the gate. Quentin paused, scanning the darkness, then quietly went back.

Isabella gave Sweetie a bath and took a quick shower herself. She was wiped from the long day. She meant to put the baby to sleep but ended up crashing herself.

Around the villa, everything went quiet.

A gentle breeze blew, and the shadows by the gate shifted slightly. A dark figure, hunched over, crept up to the villa, unlocked the door with a code, and slipped inside silently. The figure moved like they knew the place by heart. Reaching the second floor, they headed straight for the master bedroom. Pressing an ear to the door, they listened. Hearing nothing, they turned the knob and pushed the door open.

Just as one foot stepped inside, the doorbell rang urgently from downstairs.

The figure jumped, slamming the bedroom door shut. In a rush, they darted down the stairs, avoiding the main entrance, and disappeared into the first-floor storage room.

Isabella woke up to the sound of the door closing. She sat up quickly, the bedroom light was on, Sweetie lay quietly beside her, and the door was closed. It seemed the noise was just her sleepy imagination.

The doorbell downstairs kept ringing.

Isabella threw on a coat and went downstairs. Standing at the door, she checked the video intercom and saw Quentin outside.

She tightened her coat and opened the door. "Mr. Black, what brings you here so late?"

Quentin held a brand-new medical kit. "I came to return this."

Isabella was a bit surprised. It had only been a little over an hour since that incident, and Quentin had already bought a new medical kit?

Isabella reached out to take it, saying, "No rush, really. I said you didn't need to return it."

"I said I insist," Quentin replied.

Isabella sighed. "Alright, if you're that insistent, I'll take it."

Normally, when Quentin came to return the kit, she'd take it, they'd exchange a few polite words, and that'd be it. They'd say goodnight and head back to their places.

But Quentin still stood at the door, his gaze occasionally drifting past Isabella's shoulder into the house.

Isabella felt a bit uneasy. She instinctively pulled the door a bit closer. "Mr. Black, is there something else?"

Quentin hesitated, then asked, "Mind if I come in and take a look?"

Isabella's eyes widened. That was totally out of character for Quentin, and honestly, kinda weird.

She frowned. "Sorry, my husband's not home. It's not really a good time."

She tightened her grip on the doorknob, looking cautious.

Quentin was about to say something when headlights flashed, and the sound of an engine filled the air. Sebastian's car rolled into the yard and stopped. Sebastian got out and walked over.

"Sebastian," Isabella sighed in relief, opening the door a bit more.

Sebastian glanced at Quentin, suspicion in his eyes. "Mr. Black?"

Isabella, worried Sebastian might get the wrong idea, stood beside him and took his arm. "Mr. Black just moved next door. He's our new neighbor."

"Really?" Sebastian eyed Quentin. "What a coincidence."

Quentin smiled and extended his hand. "Quite a coincidence indeed. Mr. Landon, looking forward to being neighbors."

Sebastian looked at Quentin's hand but didn't shake it. Instead, he said coolly, "One should have boundaries. Mr. Black, I'm sure you get that."

Isabella was speechless. Even she could sense Sebastian's icy tone, let alone Quentin.

But Quentin didn't get mad. He just laughed it off. "I just came to return the medical kit, Mr. Landon. No need to read into it."

Isabella, not wanting any drama, especially since Quentin held a chunk of the Landon Group's shares, jumped in. "Mr. Black saved a stray cat and borrowed the kit from me. He's just returning it."

Sebastian turned to Isabella, gently adjusting her coat. "Why are you out here in so little clothing? Aren't you cold?"

Isabella shook her head. "Not cold. Why are you back so late?"

Sebastian said, "Something came up and caused a delay. My bad."

Isabella said, "It's okay; I wasn't blaming you. I was just worried."

Sebastian brushed her hair. "Where's Sweetie?"

Isabella said, "She's asleep."

The couple continued their sweet talk, almost forgetting Quentin was there, making him feel like a third wheel.

After a moment, Quentin cleared his throat. "I won't keep you. See you."

Isabella nodded politely. "See you."

Sebastian stayed silent.

As Quentin turned to leave, Isabella noticed bloodstains on his sleeve, probably from holding the cat earlier.

Suddenly, a hand covered her eyes, plunging her into darkness, and Sebastian's voice came from beside her. "Still looking?"

Isabella pulled Sebastian's hand away, meeting his jealous face.

She couldn't help but laugh. "Are you seriously jealous?"

Sebastian led her inside, closing the door and pinning her against the cabinet, his body pressed tightly against hers. "What do you think? It's the middle of the night, and you're standing at the door in your pajamas, chatting with some rando. Any normal guy would be jealous!"

###chapter 333 Breadcrumbs

Isabella was like, "What's the big deal with me rockin' pajamas? I even threw on a coat. Quentin's not some rando, right? He's a big shot in your company now, and Aunt Esme's kid. We've had dinner together. That makes him, like, a half-friend, right?"

Sebastian's face scrunched up. "Even if he's kinda your buddy, it's still a no-go."

Sebastian could be such a pain about stuff like this, but Isabella knew it was his way of showing he cared.

Thinking about it, Isabella wrapped her arms around Sebastian's neck and gave him a quick kiss. "Okay, okay. I'll be more careful next time."

Just like that, Sebastian's face softened, but he still tried to look tough. "So, what did he want?"

Isabella said, "Just returning the first aid kit."

Sebastian pressed, "And what else?"

Isabella was stumped.

She remembered Quentin's weird request earlier and still thought it was odd.

It felt like Quentin had more to say, and asking to come in was just step one. But Sebastian showed up before he could spill.

Sebastian's hand on her waist sent shivers down her spine, making it hard to sit still.

"What's got you so spaced out?" Sebastian asked.

Isabella leaned on his shoulder, catching her breath. "I was thinking about your question. Mr. Black really just came to return the first aid kit. And why do I feel like you're not a fan of his?"

Sebastian smirked. "Why should I be? He's not family. Bella, I only care about my wife and my daughter. So, what does Quentin count as?"

Isabella was left speechless by his logic.

Sebastian's hand slid under her clothes, his touch getting hotter, making his breath heavier. They kissed from the door to the sofa, tangled up for a long time. Sebastian almost took things further right there.

But suddenly, Isabella felt a chill, like someone was watching. She grabbed Sebastian's collar. "Let's go to the bedroom. I don't wanna do it here."

Sebastian's hand ran through her hair, cradling her head as he leaned in to kiss her. "Alright."

With that, Sebastian scooped her up and carried her upstairs.

The next morning, Sebastian had an emergency meeting and headed straight to the study without even changing.

After he got up, Isabella couldn't sleep either. She was starving.

Sweetie was already awake, quietly sucking her fingers.

Isabella washed up and carried Sweetie downstairs.

She put Sweetie in the cradle and pushed it to the kitchen door. Bending down, Isabella gently patted Sweetie's chubby little face. "Sweetie, be good. Mommy's making breakfast."

Sweetie waved her hands and feet, laughing, making Isabella smile.

Isabella went into the kitchen, tied on an apron, and was about to open the fridge when she noticed crumbs on the floor. Her slippers felt super uncomfortable stepping on them.

Isabella squatted down, poked at the crumbs, and brought them closer to her face. "What the heck is this?"

After a bit, she figured it out. "Breadcrumbs?"

She thought, 'Okay, breadcrumbs, but why are they all over the place near the fridge?'

Standing up, she opened the fridge and pulled out a sealed bag of bread. The bag was tied up tight, and the bread inside looked untouched.

'Maybe Sebastian made a mess while snacking?' she wondered.

Isabella shrugged it off and grabbed some bacon and veggies too.

For breakfast, she whipped up some killer sandwiches and paired them with hot milk. Simple but oh-so-good.

By the time she was done, Sebastian had wrapped up his meeting and came downstairs.

Sebastian bent down, scooped Sweetie out of the cradle, and played with her. The house was filled with their laughter.

Isabella came out with a plate, saw them, and smiled. "Wash up and let's eat."

During breakfast, Sebastian said, "How about we get a nanny?"

Isabella paused and shook her head. "Not feeling it right now." After what happened with Siena, she just couldn't trust anyone with Sweetie.

'There's been enough horror stories about nannies mistreating kids,' she thought.

She'd already made one mistake and wasn't about to make another.

"Margaret's cool with helping out during the day, and I can hit up the Jose family for dinner. It's all good." Isabella tried to sound chill, not mentioning how tired she really was.

Sebastian knew her too well and didn't push it.

The Jose family had always been good to both of them. Sebastian's bond with Zaire was strong, and with Nina in the mix, the Jose family treated Isabella like one of their own.

Margaret was happy to help, and it was nice for Sweetie to feel that family vibe.

But just as they were about to head out, a call came from the Jose family saying Margaret was sick.

So, no dropping Sweetie off there.

Isabella said, "But I gotta help Nina check on the company's progress today. The place just got renovated, and it still reeks of chemicals. I can't take Sweetie there."

Sebastian silently picked up Sweetie. "I'll take care of her today."

Isabella was shocked. "How are you gonna handle that?"

Sebastian said, "No meetings today. I'll be at the office mostly. Sweetie's chill; she's easy to handle."

Isabella thought it over and realized it was the best option. "I'll check on the company first, then come find you and Sweetie when I'm done."

"Cool." Sebastian squeezed her hand. "No rush. Just do your thing."

"Okay." Isabella kissed Sweetie's cheek and nuzzled her little nose. "Sweetie, be good. I'll come get you soon. Don't bug Daddy too much."

Sebastian looked at Isabella, his eyes soft and full of love.

Isabella and Sebastian quickly got into the car and took off.

A few minutes later, the quiet villa was suddenly filled with the sound of breaking porcelain.

###chapter 334  My Daughter

When Jack rolled up to the Landon Group, he saw a mob blocking the entrance.

Before Charles kicked the bucket, he left everything to Sebastian. Now that the Landon Group was booming, it was like a magnet for attention, with interviews popping up left and right.

The media camped out at the entrance almost daily. Sebastian was their golden goose. Even if they couldn't get a sit-down with him, a few snaps or clips were worth their weight in gold.

"Mr. Landon, they're back at it again!" Jack said, grabbing his phone to call security. "I'll get 'em outta here!"

Before Jack could hit dial, Sebastian raised his hand. "Don't bother."

Jack looked confused.

Sebastian said, "Pull the car up. I'm getting out at the front."

Sebastian was talking to Jack, but his eyes were glued to Sweetie.

Jack was baffled. "But don't you usually hate those gossip hounds? And today you brought Miss Landon along."

Jack thought, 'Isn't this just asking for trouble?'

Sebastian finally looked up. "That's exactly why I need to walk out in front of them today. Sweetie is my daughter, and I don't want the media to have any chance to drag her name through the mud."

Sebastian ordered, "Pull over!"

Jack said, "Yes, Mr. Landon."

Jack immediately drove the car over.

As soon as the media spotted Sebastian's car, they swarmed, setting up their cameras and surrounding the car.

The scene was so intense that even the seasoned Jack felt a bit rattled. "Mr. Landon, maybe we should rethink this. I'll head to the underground parking."

"Nope," Sebastian said firmly, "We're getting out here. Jack, you get out first and coordinate with security to keep things in check. They can snap all the pics they want, but they better not lay a finger on my daughter!"

Jack said, "Got it, Mr. Landon!"

As soon as Jack opened the car door, the cameras went wild, flashing in his face.

Once they realized it was just Jack, they quickly lost interest and zeroed back in on the dark car windows.

Jack was speechless. For the first time, he felt totally overlooked.

Jack teamed up with security to split the media into two groups, using barriers to clear a path for Sebastian. Then he walked to the car, gave the window a couple of taps, and opened the door.

Sebastian stepped out, entering the media frenzy.

When they saw Sweetie in his arms, there was a brief hush, followed by a burst of excitement.

"Mr. Landon, is this your kid?"

"Mr. Landon, boy or girl? Rumor has it you had a kid with an employee. True?"

"The Landon Group bans office romances. So, Mr. Landon, aren't you breaking your own rules? How can you expect respect if you don't follow them yourself? Won't your employees be ticked off?"

"Any coercion involved? Mr. Landon, care to comment?"

Sebastian walked to the company entrance and stopped, his gaze sweeping over all the media cameras. "I'll say this once, and only once. You've got ten seconds to get your cameras ready."

The crowd went nuts, straining to catch every word Sebastian was about to drop.

Sebastian said, "First off, my wife and I are in a legit relationship; no funny business. Second, she left the Landon Group ages ago. That's my statement to the board and all the employees."

Sweetie squirmed in Sebastian's arms, rubbing her eyes. Her tiny, chubby fist lightly tapped against Sebastian's suit.

The contrast between the adorable Sweetie and the imposing Sebastian was striking. The media seized the moment, snapping away like crazy.

Then they saw something even more shocking: the usually stoic Sebastian gently holding Sweetie's tiny hand.

Sebastian said, "Let me formally introduce my daughter, Stella Landon."

The media went wild again, firing off questions left and right.

"Congrats on the new addition, Mr. Landon!"

"Mr. Landon, are you and Mrs. Landon secretly hitched? Any plans to clear up these rumors?"

"When's the wedding? We heard you bought a private jet and are building a castle. Is that for the wedding?"

Sebastian locked eyes with the reporter. "Who told you that?"

The reporter felt a chill under Sebastian's gaze and quickly tried to lighten the mood with a smile. "Mr. Landon, you're the talk of the town; news travels fast."

Sebastian scanned the crowd, his tone dead serious. "Everyone, cut that part out."

The crowd was puzzled.

Sebastian said, "This is a surprise I'm planning for my wife. It's all hush-hush. If any of you spoil it, the fallout will be more than you can handle."

The crowd fell silent.

Jack stood by, secretly amused.

He thought, 'Mr. Landon's not even trying to hide the threat.'

Being upfront with the media was smart. The Landon Group was on top now. Who'd dare cross Sebastian? Their career would be toast.

But in the media game, the bold ones thrived while the timid ones starved, especially in entertainment news.

Even with Sebastian's threat, some would still risk airing it. The scoop was just too juicy to pass up.

Jack's hunch was spot on. About seventy percent of the media folks were secretly thrilled, planning to broadcast it ASAP for a big payday.

The other thirty percent were thinking about calling their bosses before making a move.

Sebastian looked around, fully aware of the game. He spoke again, "Any media that plays ball will get exclusive access to film my wedding for free."

Hearing this, Jack couldn't help but give Sebastian a thumbs up, admiring his savvy.

Jack thought, 'A mix of carrot and stick always works best. The chance to film the wedding is way more tempting than any threat!'

This way, the media wouldn't air today's footage right away. If they did, they'd wait until Sebastian's grand wedding. The exposure would be even bigger then, making it a win-win.

And just like that, the media were sold.

###chapter 335  Never Thought About It

Isabella didn't see that part of the news because it was cut off. She only saw Sebastian get out of the car, holding Sweetie, standing in front of the media, and announcing to the cameras, "This is my daughter, Stella Landon."

"He's making it official," Nina said with a smile.

There had always been various rumors about Isabella and Sebastian, ranging from office romances to workplace scandals, which were all sensational and defamatory.

Now, Sebastian's statement was enough to prove everything.

Isabella felt sweet inside. "I never needed him to do that for me. I don't care about these things. What people say outside is their business. I can't go around explaining and clarifying to everyone; that would be exhausting. As long as he's good to me, that's enough."

"You're right, but the fact that Sebastian did this shows he cares a lot about you and Sweetie." Nina paused and then asked, "So when are you planning to have the wedding?"

Isabella was taken aback.

"I haven't thought about it yet," Isabella said evasively.

Nina saw right through Isabella's thoughts. "What, Sebastian hasn't mentioned it to you?"

Isabella knew she couldn't hide it from Nina, so she didn't. She was still afraid Nina would misunderstand and blame Sebastian, so she said a few good words for him. "He's been really busy lately, and this isn't urgent."

"How can it not be urgent?" Nina became serious. "Sweetie is already born. Even if you're not in a hurry to have the wedding, you should at least get the marriage certificate first, right?"

Isabella thought it made sense. She and Sebastian should indeed get the marriage certificate.

Nina couldn't stand seeing Isabella being wronged, especially on such a big matter as marriage, so she blamed Sebastian a bit,"Sebastian is really something. At this point, nothing is more important than the wedding. At the very least, he should propose first, and then you can plan the rest. He's usually so meticulous, but how can he be so careless about this?"

Isabella smiled. "Nina, I'm fine."

Nina thought for a moment and said, "Should I have Richard remind him, or maybe have Jack hint at it? Sometimes people forget things when they're busy, and a little reminder can help."

"No, no, really, there's no need!" Isabella waved her hands hastily. "Doing so is akin to forcing him into proposing."

Isabella liked things to happen naturally; doing it this way would only make her uneasy.

"So, are you just gonna wait forever?" Nina felt sorry for Isabella and still thought Sebastian should give Isabella a proper status.

Isabella bit her lip and murmured, "It doesn't necessarily have to be waiting."

"What did you say?" Nina didn't hear clearly because Isabella's voice was too low.

Isabella shook her head. "I said that I'm willing to wait. And Sebastian cares a lot about me and Sweetie now. Maybe he's already planning the wedding and preparing to surprise me?"

Isabella said this to comfort Nina.

Nina thought, 'maybe that's true.'

After all, it was Isabella and Sebastian's business, and she couldn't interfere too much.

"Then wait a bit longer," Nina said.

"Alright." Isabella's eyes sparkled, and she secretly came up with an idea.

After being busy until noon, Isabella and Nina had lunch at a nearby restaurant. In the afternoon, with nothing much to do, Nina let her go home to rest.

Thinking about her decision, Isabella agreed.

After lunch, Nina went back to the office, and Isabella drove to a downtown mall.

In the luxuriously decorated jewelry store, as soon as Isabella walked in, a young and beautiful sales associate, Malin Eriksen, came over and enthusiastically asked what she needed.

Isabella said, "I want to buy a ring."

Malin gestured for her to follow and led her to the ring display area while continuing to ask, "Are you looking for a diamond ring, a platinum ring, or a gold ring? Our store has recently introduced several new gold ring designs, which are not only attractively priced but also hold their value exceptionally well. Many customers nowadays prefer buying and saving gold."

"I'll take a look first," Isabella had never been married and had never bought a ring, so she was clueless in this area. She needed to see the actual items and compare them before making a choice.

"Okay," Malin said warmly, inviting Isabella to sit at a round table and offering her tea and water with great enthusiasm.

After a while, Malin brought out several rings and introduced them to Isabella one by one.

Isabella listened carefully to Malin's introductions and then realized a problem. "Are these all women's rings?"

Malin asked, "Yes. what do you want to buy?"

Isabella said, "I want to buy a men's ring."

Saying this, Isabella felt a bit embarrassed, her cheeks slightly reddening.

Fortunately, Malin was experienced and didn't show any surprise. She cooperatively brought out several men's rings and recommended them one by one.

Malim suggested, "This ring, with a silver metal band and small diamonds, is simple, comfortable, and suitable for everyday wear. The plain band style suits almost everyone. We also have this gold square ring, which exudes a sense of grandeur. It is especially good for retaining value. You might also like our featured ring with straight-line engravings. It's simple in design but rich in meaning. It looks very classy when worn. And this couple's ring set, with numbers engraved on the outer band. The numbers 1-12 represent the twelve months of the year. If you want to customize it, you can have your lover's initials, birthday, or a romantic number engraved on the inner band."

Isabella was overwhelmed by Malin's introductions and dazzled by the rings.

The worst part was that despite all the introductions, Isabella didn't like any of them.

"Ma'am, which one do you prefer? Do you know your lover's ring size? If you want to make slight modifications to the existing design, that's also possible, but it will cost extra."

Malin looked at Isabella with a smile, waiting for her to place an order after her series of sales pitches.

Isabella hesitated and said, "I'm sorry."

"You didn't like any of them?" Malin's expression changed instantly.

Isabella was speechless.

Malin stared at Isabella, her eyes showing a hint of reproach and contempt. It seemed like she was about to start yelling.

Isabella didn't expect to be looked down upon just for buying a ring.

Just as Isabella was about to speak, she heard the sound of footsteps behind her, followed by a calm and authoritative female voice,"What's wrong with not liking any one of them? Are you going to force her to buy?"

###chapter 336  So Handsome

Malin clicked her tongue, ready to let out a string of curses, but then she spun around and saw Esme. Just like that, her anger vanished, replaced by a big ol' grin. "Esme, our boss has been waiting for you forever. Why didn't you give us a heads-up? I could've come down to meet you."

Isabella was just as shocked to see Esme. From what Malin said, it seemed like Esme was here on business. Once Isabella's eyes locked onto Esme, she couldn't look away.

Isabella had met plenty of folks with fancy manners, but none of them held a candle to Esme. Esme's class and grace seemed like they were part of her DNA. Anything that looked forced on others seemed effortless on her.

Esme strolled over, gave Malin a quick once-over, and said, "If I didn't come up, how would I see how you treat your customers? In the jewelry biz, rule number one is to treat the customer right. 'The customer is always right'-didn't your boss drill that into you during training? Who gave you the nerve to throw a fit at a customer?"

Malin's face went beet red. She kept apologizing, first to Esme, then to Isabella. "I'm so sorry, Ms. Miller. I really didn't mean any harm. Please forgive me."

Isabella, being a softie, couldn't handle people begging her. Seeing Malin's genuine apology, she was about to say it was no big deal.

But before she could get a word out, Esme cut in, "If a brand wants to grow and succeed, it's not just about design and products; reputation and honor are key. Honestly, your store's service is way below my standards."

With that, Esme stepped forward, gently took Isabella's hand, and said to Malin, "Tell your boss I was here. As for the collaboration, I don't think we're a good match."

Malin looked like she was about to cry.

But Esme didn't give a damn if she cried or not. She took Isabella's hand and walked out of the jewelry store without a backward glance.

Esme's tone was firm, and her actions were decisive. So Isabella saw Esme as her hero. Watching Esme walk away, Isabella felt like Esme was glowing.

Esme wasn't alone. A middle-aged guy was waiting for her outside. When he saw her come out, he nodded. "Mrs. Black."

Esme said to him, "I ran into a friend. I'll be here for a bit. You can wait downstairs."

"Yes, Mrs. Black." The guy nodded and then turned to leave.

Esme then looked at Isabella, her gaze soft but sharp. "Isabella, I didn't expect to see you here."

Isabella said, "Yeah, I didn't expect it either."

"Are you here to buy a ring? Getting hitched?" Esme asked, a bit curious. "You saved my life. For something as big as your wedding, you gotta let me know. I'll come with a killer gift!"

Isabella smiled. "If you could come, it would be an honor. But I'm not getting married. I was just passing by and thought I'd check it out."

"I see." Esme squeezed her fingers. "Can I call you Bella? It feels more friendly."

"Of course," Isabella felt all warm and fuzzy inside, finding Esme even more charming, though she was still a bit worried. "Do you think what just happened will mess things up for you?"

"Nah," Esme shook her head. "They wanted me to design some jewelry sets. I already did my homework on them and found out their rep is kinda shady. The boss's background is sketchy too. I was on the fence, but they seemed super eager, so I thought I'd check it out. By the way, thanks. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have seen how their sales associate acts. My name, Esme, isn't something to be dragged through the mud by these folks. My rule is either I don't collaborate, or if I do, it's gotta be top-notch. Clearly, they don't make the cut."

Isabella listened, eyes wide with admiration. "Aunt Esme, you're so badass!"

Esme smiled, still a bit cautious. "Really? You don't think I'm too bossy or controlling?"

"Not at all," Isabella said, "You're talented, capable, and totally my hero."

Esme's smile grew. "I'm glad you think so."

She glanced at her watch. "It's still early. If you don't have other plans, how about I treat you to some coffee?"

"Sure," Isabella said, "I was just thinking about grabbing a cup."

As she spoke, Isabella linked arms with Esme, and the two of them chatted while heading to the cafÃ©.

Back at the jewelry store, just after Isabella and Esme left, Vilma Hansen came out from the back. She checked her watch and asked Malin, "It's this late; why hasn't Esme shown up yet? Go downstairs and check."

Malin's eyes flickered, and she stammered, "Ms. Hansen, Esme was just here."

Vilma asked, "She was here? Where is she now?"

Malin said, "She left."

Vilma said, "Left? Why did she leave? Didn't you greet her? Didn't you tell her I was waiting inside? If she came, why didn't you inform me? Are you all idiots? If she wanted to leave, couldn't you stop her?"

Malin said, "I'm sorry, Ms. Hansen. Here's what happened."

Malin cried as she recounted the events.

Vilma listened, her brows furrowing deeply.

Malin tearfully complained, "Ms. Hansen, I really didn't say anything. Esme targeted me for no reason!"

Vilma ignored Malin's excuses and said to someone nearby, "Pull up the surveillance footage. I want to see what happened."

The footage was quickly retrieved. After watching it, Vilma turned to the still-crying Malin and said, "You're fired!"

Malin was stunned.

Vilma didn't give Malin a chance to explain; she immediately had her thrown out.

Then, Vilma returned to her office and tried calling Esme's assistant. But they firmly refused the collaboration.

Vilma, out of options, decided to call someone else.

As soon as the call connected, Vilma began to cry. "You have to save me this time."

In the coffee shop, Isabella ordered two coffees and two desserts.

When the coffee arrived, Isabella added a ton of sugar cubes.

Esme, watching from across the table, frowned. "Bella, isn't that way too much sugar?"

###chapter 337 The Stay-at-Home Dad

Isabella, feeling a bit awkward, stopped what she was doing and said, "Sorry for making a fool of myself."

Esme shook her head. "Nah, I'm just curious. Never seen anyone dump that much sugar in their coffee before."

Isabella took a sip and found it just right. "I can't stand bitter stuff."

"Why's that?" Esme seemed intrigued by everything about Isabella.

Isabella shrugged and said, "Had too much bitterness growing up. Now, I just want the sweet stuff. No more bitter for me."

Esme's face changed a bit, like she'd been hit in the feels, and she couldn't find her words.

Seeing Esme's reaction, Isabella laughed. "Just kidding. I just don't like bitter things. The rest was just me messing around. Don't worry, Aunt Esme."

Even though Isabella tried to lighten the mood, things still felt a bit heavy. Esme looked at her with a pained expression. "Bella, you said your mom left you. Do you hate her?"

Isabella thought for a second and said, "Nope, I don't."

Esme seemed relieved. "Why not?"

"Because I don't love her, so I don't care. 'Mother' is just a word to me. I know she exists, but I don't know her. Can't hate a ghost."

Esme looked down, nervously fidgeting with her coffee cup, lost in Isabella's words.

Esme had imagined all sorts of harsh, cold, and angry responses, but she never expected Isabella to say, "I don't care."

"Aunt Esme, Aunt Esme?" Isabella called out.

Esme snapped back, looking a bit stiff.

"You okay?" Isabella asked, concerned.

Esme forced a smile and took a sip of her coffee, feeling the bitterness spread through her.

Noticing the time, Isabella said she had to pick up Sweetie.

Esme quickly offered, "Where you headed? I can give you a lift."

"No need," Isabella waved her off. "I drove here."

Esme hesitated and then asked, "Mind if I visit your place? I'd love to meet your daughter and bring her some gifts."

Esme's enthusiasm was so genuine that if Isabella hadn't saved her at Blue Horizon Cafe before, she might've thought Esme had some hidden agenda.

Esme's sincerity left Isabella no choice but to agree. Isabella figured since Quentin lived next door, maybe Esme was just being neighborly.

Isabella said, "Alright then. I need to stop by the Landon Group first. My daughter's with her dad today."

"Okay," Esme nodded. "I'll grab some gifts and wait for you at your place."

They parted ways at the coffee shop entrance.

The Landon Group.

As soon as Isabella walked into the CEO's office, Laura stood up from her desk and loudly greeted, "Hello, Mrs. Landon."

There was a brief silence, then everyone stood up together, respectfully and loudly saying, "Hello, Mrs. Landon!"

Isabella blushed and pulled Laura aside. "Can you not make such a big deal out of it?"

Laura giggled, "It's not me. Mr. Landon wanted to make sure everyone knew who you were, especially the newbies. He even posted your photo in the group chat, saying you're his wife. You wouldn't believe it, but some folks here actually obsessed with your picture."

Isabella looked puzzled. "Why would be obsessed with me?"

Laura laughed, "You don't get it. The guys think you'll bless them with fat paychecks, and the girls hope they can marry rich and live the high life like you."

Isabella was speechless.

Feeling a mix of boredom and amusement, she asked, "Where's Sebastian?"

"Mr. Landon's in a meeting," Laura said, "In the K3 conference room. Want me to take you there?"

Isabella shook her head. "Nah, I got it. You can get back to work."

Isabella knew her way around the Landon Group, having worked there before.

Laura nodded, then remembered something and asked, "Is your nanny still around? Did you take my advice last time?"

Isabella replied, "She's gone."

"Why? Did she mess up again?" Laura guessed. It was odd enough that Sebastian brought Sweetie to work today. Laura's curiosity got the best of her, and she wanted to dig deeper to confirm her suspicions about Siena.

Isabella thought for a moment, deciding there was no need to go into details about Siena. She made up a reason to brush it off.

Laura didn't press further. "Good riddance. I always thought that nanny had a weird vibe."

Isabella patted her shoulder. "Thanks, Laura. I'll treat you to a meal sometime."

Laura's eyes lit up. "Really? I want a big feast. I've been pulling overtime with Mr. Landon every day. I'm beat."

Isabella smiled. "You got it. Your pick."

K3 Conference Room.

When Isabella got there, the door was closed, and the meeting was still going on.

Peeking through the blinds, she saw the execs in suits around the long table. Sebastian was at the head, looking all serious.

But then she noticed Sebastian's leg bent, resting on his other knee, forming a cradle. He had a black pen in one hand, scribbling on a notebook, while the other hand held Sweetie, occasionally patting her.

The scene was both funny and oddly heartwarming.

After a bit, Jack showed up.

He had a bottle of freshly made formula and handed it to Sebastian.

Sebastian placed Sweetie on his lap, put down the pen, and shook the bottle with both hands.

The exec sitting closest to Sebastian noticed first.

He nudged the person next to him, signaling them to look.

One by one, all the execs' attention shifted to Sebastian feeding Sweetie.

###chapter 338 Someone Else

The whole conference room was dead silent.

It was so quiet that Sweetie sucking on her pacifier sounded like a freakin' megaphone, echoing in everyone's ears, kinda funny.

Sebastian glanced down at Sweetie, all lovey-dovey.

Then, he snapped out of it, looked around, and frowned. "Why'd y'all stop? Keep going."

Everyone was like, "Seriously?"

Isabella, watching from outside, almost lost it laughing.

She'd been worried Sebastian would be all awkward with Sweetie, but now she realized she was trippin'. Sebastian brought Sweetie along, leaving everyone else in a jam.

She noticed those usually high-and-mighty execs were about to lose it.

After the meeting, Isabella scooped up Sweetie.

Sebastian, still uneasy, had Jack drive them home.

Isabella agreed and filled him in on running into Esme, mentioning that Esme would be dropping by their place later.

Hearing this, Sebastian's face showed a flicker of understanding. He squeezed her shoulder and asked, "Bella, you like Esme?"

Isabella nodded. "Yeah. She's super nice, gentle, and kind."

Sebastian hugged her. "As long as you like her."

Isabella felt like he had more to say, but just as she was about to ask, his phone rang.

Knowing Sebastian was busy, Isabella didn't take up more of his time and took Sweetie home.

When Jack dropped Isabella off at the door, Esme's car was already there, like she'd been waiting forever.

Isabella politely invited Esme inside. "I thought you'd visit Mr. Black's place first."

Surprisingly, Esme had been waiting at the door.

Esme sat by the cradle, looking at the well-fed and sleeping Sweetie with a gentle gaze. Hearing Isabella's words, she was a bit surprised. "Mr. Black?"

Isabella came over with a plate of fruit. "It's your son, actually. He just moved next door to us yesterday."

Isabella paused, noticing a flicker of unease in Esme's expression.

"He didn't tell me about this," Esme said, "I had no idea he moved here and became your neighbor."

"Maybe he's just been super busy," Isabella said, trying to speak well of Quentin, mainly because she didn't want her words to mess up Esme and Quentin's relationship. "Mr. Black is a solid and steady guy. He probably wanted to get everything sorted before telling you."

Esme gave a faint smile. "Maybe."

Esme didn't seem too bothered, her eyes fixed on Sweetie in the cradle. She gently touched Sweetie's soft blanket, like she was looking at a precious treasure.

"Bella, can I hold her?" Esme hesitated for a long time before finally asking.

"Of course." Isabella stood up, carefully taking Sweetie out of the cradle and handing her to Esme.

Esme took Sweetie, and at that moment, she felt over the moon.

"She's so beautiful, so cute," Esme couldn't help but gush. She then said to Isabella, "Her nose and chin look a lot like yours."

Isabella smiled. "Really? I can't really tell. I've always thought she looks more like her dad."

As they were chatting, a cat's meow suddenly came from the windowsill.

Isabella turned her head, eyes lighting up with surprise. "Is that cat walking now?"

The cat was chilling outside the windowsill, super calm. It didn't seem scared of people; even when Isabella walked up to it, it didn't budge.

Isabella opened the window and gently brought it inside, noticing a strong medicinal smell coming from it. Its tiny body was wrapped in layers of bandages.

Isabella held it, and it didn't struggle, just curled up obediently in her hands. Feeling her touch, it meowed twice.

"Your recovery skills are off the charts," Isabella said with a smile.

At that moment, Isabella realized Esme hadn't spoken for a while. Turning around, she saw Esme staring at the cat in her hands, lost in thought.

Isabella said, "This is Mr. Black's cat."

Esme frowned and instinctively asked, "How do you know?"

"He saved this cat yesterday, and I was there," Isabella said, "Was Mr. Black a doctor before? I saw him bandaging the cat like a pro, not something an amateur could do."

Esme lowered her eyes. "Quentin was a doctor before, but not anymore."

Hearing this, Isabella felt there must be a story behind it, but since Esme didn't elaborate, she didn't push. She changed the topic, "This cat was seriously messed up and on the brink of death yesterday. I'm amazed at its vitality; it's already up and about today."

Esme glanced at the cat and asked, "How did it get hurt?"

Isabella said, "I don't know. When Mr. Black found it, it had a long wound on its belly. Mr. Black said it didn't look like an accident, more like someone did it. I don't know what kind of psycho would actually hurt a defenseless little cat. But luckily, Mr. Black found it and saved its life."

After Isabella finished speaking, she noticed Esme staring blankly.

Isabella called, "Aunt Esme?"

Esme snapped out of it and smiled. "I'm fine."

The cat let out a meow and suddenly leapt from Isabella's hands. Despite still being injured, it jumped from a considerable height, landing awkwardly. Isabella's heart skipped a beat, fearing it might tear open its belly wound.

Isabella froze for a couple of seconds, just about to pick up the cat when it suddenly darted forward a few steps and started meowing fiercely in the direction of the first floor.

The hissing was different from its earlier cute meows; it was filled with aggression. The cat arched its back, and its light blue fur stood up like sharp needles.

For a moment, the entire villa was filled with the cat's terrifying screeches.

Sweetie, who had been sleeping soundly, suddenly woke up and started crying, probably freaked out by the noise.

Isabella was even more unsettled by the scene. If Esme weren't there, she might have grabbed Sweetie and bolted out of the house in fear!

Esme, who was soothing Sweetie, stood up from the couch, glanced in the direction the cat was meowing, and suddenly asked, "Bella, is there someone else living here?"

###chapter 339 Won't Believe Anymore

Isabella got chills all over when she heard that question.

She shook her head without thinking. "Nope."

But right after she said it, she knew something was off. She remembered those bread crumbs she found under the fridge that morning.

She had a weird feeling back then but didn't think much of it.

Isabella's eyes darted to that spot, and she thought, 'Siena!'

The doorbell rang out of nowhere, making Isabella jump.

She practically sprinted to the door. Seeing Quentin there made her feel a lot safer.

After all, it was just her and Esme, and they had Sweetie with them. If something went down, they were pretty much useless. If things got crazy, Esme and she would probably freak out.

Quentin showing up right then was like a lifeline for Isabella.

"Did you see that cat? I..." Quentin started, but Isabella yanked him inside. She quickly grabbed some slippers from the shoe cabinet. "Put these on."

Quentin glanced at where she had grabbed him, a weird look in his eyes. But when he looked up, he seemed normal again. "Sure."

By now, Quentin could hear the cat meowing inside.

Esme came over with Sweetie in her arms. "Quentin, perfect timing. We think someone might be hiding in Bella's house."

Esme had figured it out from Isabella's face. Isabella probably had no clue someone was hiding; she looked totally shocked.

When Quentin walked into the living room, the cat was still there, showing its sharp teeth and meowing.

Isabella had never seen a cat act like this. She used to think it was cute, but now it just seemed creepy.

Isabella thought, if they really found someone hiding, she'd probably never look at a cat the same way again.

Quentin squatted down behind the cat and tapped the floor with his fingers, making a thumping sound. "Cheese."

Isabella guessed that must be what he called the cat.

Cheese quickly turned around and walked towards Quentin, its fur still standing up.

Quentin picked up Cheese, and it curled up in his arms, but its eyes stayed fixed on that spot, making a huffing sound.

While petting Cheese, Quentin looked back at Isabella. "Any idea who might be hiding there?"

Isabella frowned. "Maybe my husband's sister, Siena. But she was sent back to her hometown, so I don't know if she snuck back."

Quentin nodded. "I'll check it out."

He started walking towards that spot.

Isabella, still scared, reached out to stop him. "Aren't you scared?"

Quentin looked at her and smiled a bit. "Scared of what?"

Siena, a girl, couldn't possibly take down Quentin. A tall, strong guy like him definitely made them feel safer.

Isabella let go. "I'll go with you."

Quentin hesitated for a second, then nodded.

Walking down the hallway, Isabella stopped in front of a door.

This was the room Siena had stayed in before. It had been empty since she left, and Isabella usually didn't come here. If Siena had really snuck back, coming out during the day when no one was home or in the middle of the night, no one would have noticed!

Just thinking about it gave Isabella the creeps.

Quentin shot a look at Isabella before trying the doorknob. After a few tries, it wouldn't budge.

"It's locked from the inside," Quentin said.

Isabella was now sure Siena was in there.

She frowned and said loudly, "Let's call the cops! I think there's a burglar in the house."

Quentin nodded, playing along. "Yeah, let the pros handle it."

After they finished talking, they waited a few seconds. Then, the lock clicked, and the door swung open.

Standing there was Siena!

Seeing Siena, Isabella felt a mix of surprise and calm.

She had a hunch Siena had snuck back, but actually seeing her there was still pretty freaky.

"Siena, when did you sneak in?" Isabella's voice was serious, her hands clenched and shaking.

Isabella couldn't imagine how long Siena would've stayed hidden if the cat hadn't come in tonight. She believed Siena had gone to great lengths to sneak in with bad intentions.

She wasn't too worried about herself and Seb-they always locked their bedroom doors at night. But if they ever slipped up, Sweetie could be in danger.

Isabella had seen too many situations like this.

She thought, 'I've learned from Samantha, Vanessa, Emma, and Charles that human nature is unpredictable; good and evil are just a thought away.'

Siena had every reason and motive to harm them.

The more Isabella thought about it, the more scared she got. She felt she should tell Sebastian first and then figure out what to do.

Seeing Isabella pull out her phone, Siena panicked.

"Isabella." Siena tried to rush over, reaching for Isabella's phone.

Quentin narrowed his eyes and easily grabbed Siena's wrist, holding her back.

Siena was no match for Quentin. She gritted her teeth and dropped to her knees. "Isabella, please don't call the cops. I just have nowhere else to go, so I snuck back to stay for a few days. I planned to leave quietly once I found a job. I promise I won't bother you and Sebastian anymore. Isabella, I don't want to go back to my hometown. I just want to stay in Lakina. Please, let me go this time."

Isabella shook her head. "Siena, I don't believe a word you say anymore."

As she spoke, the call connected.

Isabella explained the situation to Sebastian, who was silent for a moment before calmly saying, "Call the cops."

Isabella glanced at Siena. "Okay."

After hanging up, Isabella called the police.

The cops would take at least twenty minutes to get there. In the meantime, Isabella told Siena to pack her things.

Siena kept crying, but she didn't have much to pack, just a black backpack with some basic toiletries.

During this time, Cheese stopped meowing and curled up quietly in Quentin's arms.

Sweetie also stopped crying and slept quietly in Isabella's arms.

Esme looked at Sweetie with pity. "This poor kid must be terrified. It's heartbreaking she has to go through this at such a young age."

Isabella held Sweetie tightly, feeling heartbroken.

Quentin's gaze was on Isabella, not Sweetie.

Siena noticed this and looked at Isabella with growing jealousy in her eyes.

###chapter 340  She Is My Sister

Isabella felt a sharp stare hit her like a dart. She turned to see Siena, tears streaming down her face. "Isabella, can I hold Sweetie one last time?" she choked out.

Isabella stayed quiet.

Siena sobbed harder. "I know I don't deserve it, but I did take care of Sweetie. I really like her. I just want to say goodbye."

Sirens wailed outside.

Isabella looked at the crying Siena. "No need for goodbyes, Siena. Just follow your heart and live your best life. You're still young. If you get it together, things'll turn around."

That was all the comfort she could offer, but whether Siena would listen was another story.

Siena bit her lip and nodded.

The doorbell rang. Quentin said, "I'll get it."

He walked past Siena, his eyes briefly on the hand hidden in her sleeve, his brow furrowing. But he didn't stop and went to open the door.

Two cops stood outside. After checking some info, they were about to come in.

Then Quentin heard a gasp from the living room.

"Bella!" Quentin turned back to the living room, the two cops right behind him.

They rushed in and saw the scene.

Isabella stood still, holding Sweetie. Esme had her arms out, standing in front of Isabella, eyes wide with shock, staring at Siena. Tears still streaked Siena's cheeks, but her eyes were full of jealousy, not fragility.

Siena stepped forward, her whole body ready to attack. Her hands were outstretched, gripping something hard.

Esme's dress was quickly getting soaked with blood.

It all happened too fast. After pretending to say goodbye, Siena had turned to leave. No one expected her to spin back, rushing forward with a sharp fruit knife hidden in her sleeve.

The knife was aimed right at Isabella.

If Esme hadn't jumped in the way, it would be Isabella bleeding now!

"Mom!" Quentin shouted, rushing forward and yanking Siena away.

But Siena's hands clung to the knife handle. Even when Quentin pushed her, she didn't let go. The knife came out of Esme's body with a sickening sound.

Blood splattered everywhere, covering Siena's face. She blinked instinctively, and in the next moment, the cops had her hands restrained. The bloody knife clattered to the ground.

Isabella watched as Esme collapsed in front of her, the room reeking of blood.

In the end, the cops took Siena away.

Isabella had called the police just to give Siena a warning, but now it had turned into an arrest. Siena's attack would likely lead to serious charges.

Esme's wound was deep and bleeding badly. There was no time to wait for an ambulance. Quentin scooped her up and rushed her to the car, speeding to the hospital.

Isabella didn't waste a second and followed, clutching Sweetie tight.

Quentin floored it, pushing the car faster and faster.

Isabella held Esme's hand, her heart racing as she saw the towel soaked with blood. "Aunt Esme, hang in there! We're almost at the hospital!"

Esme's breaths were shallow, all her strength focused on gripping Isabella's hand. "Bella, Bella."

"I'm here, Aunt Esme. I'm right here." Isabella leaned in, tears streaming down her face. "Why did you shield me? Am I worth it?"

"Bella, don't hate me," Esme's voice trembled, her words broken and shaky. She seemed like she had so much to say.

Isabella shook her head fiercely. "Aunt Esme, how could I hate you? You saved me."

"Bella, I'm your mom. I didn't abandon you on purpose," Esme said, tears welling up.

"Mom?" Isabella's eyes widened in shock, her mind going blank.

Quentin, driving up front, tightened his lips and glanced at Isabella in the rearview mirror.

"Bella, don't hate me," Esme's eyes were filled with regret and guilt, reflecting Isabella's face.

"Can you call me mom?" Esme asked.

Isabella was stunned, unable to react, or maybe just not knowing how to.

When Isabella stayed silent for too long, Esme's eyes closed in disappointment. Her grip on Isabella's hand weakened, slipping away like a lifeless leaf in the wind.

Isabella instinctively grabbed Esme's hand, then heard Quentin shout, "We're here!"

Quentin drove straight to the emergency entrance, and medics rushed Esme in on a stretcher. Isabella got out of the car, her legs giving way, stumbling forward.

Suddenly, Quentin was there, supporting her arm. "Let me hold the baby."

Isabella stared at him, dazed.

"I'll hold her for you," Quentin said.

Isabella nodded, handing Sweetie over. Then they both walked into the emergency room.

Esme was already being rushed in for treatment, and a nurse called out, "Family members, please come handle the paperwork."

Quentin walked over, and Isabella followed.

Quentin signed the forms with one hand, while Isabella stood silently, her mind still spinning.

The nurse glanced at Isabella, then said to Quentin, "Sir, your wife looks a bit pale. Maybe she should take the child to rest over there?"

Isabella was stunned, realizing they were being mistaken for a family.

Just as she was about to explain, Quentin said, "You misunderstood. She's my sister."

The nurse awkwardly apologized.

Quentin just smiled, letting it slide.

Isabella looked at Quentin, her feelings a mix of confusion and gratitude, still thinking about his words, "She's my sister."

After finishing the paperwork, Isabella and Quentin went to wait outside the emergency room together.

###chapter 341 It's Finally Settled

During this whole mess, the docs kept coming out, saying the patient was in bad shape. The last time, they even asked the family to sign some serious paperwork.

Isabella was on edge, and those bright lights were making her feel all woozy, like she was in some weird dream.

Out of nowhere, someone gave her a gentle tap on the shoulder. She turned and saw Quentin's warm, concerned eyes. He handed her a paper cup. "Here, drink some warm water."

Isabella mumbled a thank you, took the cup, and sipped a bit. The warm water felt good going down, finally giving her some comfort. She handed the empty cup back to Quentin. "Got any more?"

Quentin smiled. "Yeah, sure."

He took the cup and headed to the nurse's station to get more water.

Isabella downed four cups in a row, each one fetched by Quentin. Even though she was sitting a bit away from the nurse's station, she could still hear two young nurses gossiping.

"He's so hot!"

"Totally, and he's so classy. Plus, he's super sweet. Look how he treats his sister!"

"I wish I had a brother like that."

"Haha, let's all dream big tonight and maybe we'll get lucky."

Hearing this, Isabella just looked down.

"More water." Quentin's voice came from above, and the cup was in front of her again.

Isabella took it but didn't drink. She just stared at the water, lost in thought.

Quentin sat down next to her, staying quiet. They both stayed silent until the emergency room door opened and a nurse came out, making Quentin stand up.

Isabella looked up nervously, biting her lip.

The nurse smiled a bit. "Don't worry. The patient is out of danger. The doctor wanted me to let you know."

"Thanks." Quentin's face relaxed.

Isabella's tense body finally eased up. She felt exhausted, probably from being so stressed for so long.

She took a sip of water and heard Quentin ask, "Wanna head back?"

Isabella looked up.

Quentin said, "Should I call Sebastian to pick you up?"

Isabella shook her head. "I'll wait until Aunt Esme..."

She paused and corrected herself, "I'll wait until Esme wakes up before leaving. She got hurt saving me, after all."

Quentin's eyes showed he understood. "You can't forgive her?"

Isabella didn't know what to say.

Quentin went on, "Don't beat yourself up. You saved her life before, and now she saved yours. It's even."

Even though his words made sense, Isabella still felt uneasy, her mind full of thoughts about Esme. She didn't want to stay, but she didn't want to leave either.

After a while, they wheeled Esme into the ward. She was still out cold. Isabella looked at the once beautiful and delicate Esme, now lying there pale with an oxygen mask. The monitors showed her vital signs, and Isabella's heart ached.

Isabella had never been a cold-hearted person. Esme had risked her life to save her, and Isabella couldn't ignore that.

But what should've been a simple feeling was now all tangled up because of Esme's true identity, leaving Isabella totally confused.

Quentin came out of the bathroom with a wet towel. He walked over and wiped the blood off Esme's face and hands.

There was a knock on the door.

The door to the ward opened, and it was Sebastian.

Undoubtedly, it was Quentin who called him, prompting Sebastian to put aside his work and rush over.

Sebastian first looked at Isabella sitting on the sofa, then at Esme lying on the bed, and asked Quentin, "How is she?"

Quentin said, "No big worries; the wound wasn't fatal. But it's pretty deep, and she lost a lot of blood when she got here. She's still out cold, and the doctor said it'll be a few hours before she wakes up."

"Okay." Sebastian nodded slightly and walked over to Isabella.

Isabella sat on the sofa, with Sebastian standing in front of her. He gently turned her head to rest against his chest, softly patting her cheek with his palm, and said, "It's alright now."

At this moment, Sweetie, who had been sleeping, woke up and started crying, probably hungry.

Quentin walked over, glanced at Isabella, and said, "She's been really scared today and has been in the hospital for a long time. Why don't you take them home first? I'll call you when my mom wakes up."

Quentin had already briefly described the situation over the phone. So Sebastian knew that Esme was in this condition because she had taken a knife for Isabella.

Sebastian's tone was no longer as harsh as before. He nodded and said, "I'll bring Bella to visit Esme tomorrow."

Quentin nodded and watched them leave.

After closing the door, Quentin sat on the sofa, resting his head on his hand, and rubbed his temples with his eyes closed.

Sebastian's car was parked in the hospital's underground parking lot. After getting in the car, Sebastian placed Sweetie to the side, took a clean towel from the compartment, wet it, and wiped Isabella's hands and face.

Isabella was in a daze for a moment, then raised her hand to hold his wrist. "Sebastian, I heard something really shocking today."

Sebastian looked at her. "Hmm. What is it?"

Isabella licked her lips, still feeling thirsty. She struggled to get the words out of her throat. "Esme told me not to hate her in the car today. She also said she's mom. Do you think this is some kind of joke?"

As she spoke, Isabella gave a slight, bitter smile.

Sebastian looked at Isabella but didn't smile. His thumb gently caressed Isabella's cheek, a hint of turmoil evident in his eyes. "Bella, have you ever considered that this might not be a joke?"

Isabella pursed her lips.

Sebastian sighed. "When Esme first appeared, I had Jack investigate her. I knew she came back to reconnect with her family. Everything that happened afterward confirmed that she was deliberately getting close to you. I knew from the moment she gave you that gold bracelet at dinner."

Isabella's eyelashes trembled. She was lost in thought for a long time, then suddenly lowered her head, took off the bracelet from her wrist, and threw it out of the car window without hesitation.

The bracelet fell to the ground, rolled a few times, and was run over by an oncoming car.

Isabella saw that, bit her lip hard, and then looked away. "I don't hate her, but I don't want to accept her either."

Sebastian hugged her. "Whatever decision you make, I'm here for you."

Isabella's eyes welled up. "Okay."

The last ray of sunlight sank below the horizon, and the world fell into darkness.

In the silent hospital room, a faint light glimmered. Esme slowly opened her eyes and saw Quentin sitting by the bed.

###chapter 342 The Wound Reopens

"Hey, Mom, you're up?" Quentin's voice was all raspy in the dim room.

Esme looked around the hospital room. Before she could ask, Quentin jumped in, "Isabella already headed back."

He was sitting with his back to the light, making it hard to read his face.

"Quentin, did you know about what went down tonight?" Esme's voice was shaky for some reason.

Quentin tilted his chin up a bit, eyes all intense. "Which part are you talking about?"

Esme was thrown off by his question, emotions swirling in her tired eyes. "Cheese only listens to you. Without your say-so, it wouldn't have barged in and exposed the woman hiding at Isabella's place."

Quentin let out a soft chuckle. "Yeah, I knew. I saw that woman sneak in myself."

"Why didn't you tell Isabella earlier?" Esme asked, almost immediately realizing something. "Have you been waiting for a moment like tonight?"

"Yep." Quentin nodded, still calm and steady.

Esme couldn't believe it. She tried to get up, but the knife wound on her body made her wince in pain. She fell back onto the pillow, sweating like crazy.

Siena's stab wasn't fatal, but it was deep. As Esme moved, she felt the stitches tear open, bleeding again.

Esme lay back, staring at the ceiling. The pain messed up her breathing, making it all irregular.

"Why?" Esme murmured, "Do you know that stab could've been fatal?"

Whether it was her or Isabella, it was super dangerous. If it had been an accident, Esme wouldn't have said anything. But thinking Quentin was in on this made her feel like something was crushing her chest, making it hard to breathe.

"I know." Quentin lowered his eyes. "But without this, we'd be stuck. I'm just trying to get things moving."

Esme didn't say anything. She knew what Quentin meant by getting things moving.

Quentin said, "I didn't let Siena in. I just wanted to use her to make Isabella see the truth sooner."

Esme shook her head. "Quentin, I know you're anxious. I'm even more anxious than you. But things need to move gradually. I just wanted to take it slow."

"Take it slow?" Quentin sneered, snapping back, "You have time to take it slow, but does Lova?"

Esme was speechless.

After a moment, she slowly closed her eyes, looking super tired. "You gotta give me some time. After all, Bella is my daughter too."

Quentin straightened up and leaned back in the chair. "I'll give you time. But from now on, you gotta follow my lead."

With that, Quentin pulled out his phone, turned on the camera, and pointed it at Esme.

Seeing Quentin slowly get up, Esme's eyes filled with fear. "Quentin, what are you doing?"

Isabella lay down on the bed after her shower, touching her empty wrist, lost in thought.

Sweetie was lying next to her. Probably napped too much during the day, so now she was all wide-eyed and kicking her little feet, waving her tiny hands, making those cute baby noises.

Isabella turned her head and locked eyes with Sweetie.

Seeing her, Sweetie immediately squinted and smiled, reaching out to touch Isabella's face, making those adorable cooing sounds.

Isabella gently held Sweetie's little hand. "Sweetie, do you think I should forgive Esme?"

"Ahh." Sweetie happily waved her little hand.

Isabella muttered, "You think I'm being cold for not acknowledging her? But she ditched me when I was a kid. How can I just let that go?"

With each word, Isabella's mood got heavier. But her mind kept replaying the scene from a few hours ago when Siena lunged with a knife, and Esme jumped in to shield her without a second thought.

In that split second, no one could've predicted what would happen. But when danger hit, Esme rushed to protect her without hesitation.

Isabella closed her eyes, her mind a mess.

Her phone buzzed twice, showing a video from an unknown number.

The video's thumbnail was Esme lying on a hospital bed.

Isabella held her phone, not opening the video. Sebastian walked over. "Bella?"

Isabella snapped out of it, turned off the phone screen, and tossed it aside.

That night, Isabella couldn't sleep. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw that intense scene and remembered Esme's words on the way to the hospital. It played in her mind like a movie on repeat.

Her phone buzzed twice again, this time with news from a website.

Isabella deleted the news and looked at the unread video message below.

After hesitating for a moment, she finally opened the video.

In the video, Esme was curled up in pain on the hospital bed, tears mixed with sweat streaming down her face. There was the sound of a nurse's bell, doors opening and closing, and Quentin urgently calling for a doctor.

The screen shook a few times, the phone fell, and the video ended in darkness.

Isabella was moved by the video. She almost immediately stood up and rushed to the door.

She didn't even think about Sweetie in the cradle.

While changing shoes at the door, Sebastian grabbed her. "What's wrong?"

Isabella's face was pale. "The hospital, I need to go to the hospital."

Sebastian's expression showed understanding. He nodded. "I'll go with you."

When they got to the hospital, they only saw Quentin.

Isabella glanced at the empty hospital bed, her heart sinking. She immediately grabbed Quentin's wrist. "Where's my mom?"

Quentin looked at her, a subtle expression flashing in his eyes. "Her wound reopened and got a bit infected. She's in the debridement room getting it stitched up again. Don't worry; it's not a big deal."

Sebastian frowned. "Reopened? How did the wound reopen?"

Sebastian had also seen the video Quentin sent to Isabella. Honestly, he was a bit suspicious of Quentin's motives.

###chapter 343 Forgiveness

Quentin let out a heavy sigh and said, "When she woke up, she was all about seeing Isabella. She got super emotional, and before I could do anything, she fell off the bed."

Just hearing that made Isabella's heart race. That hospital bed was crazy high; even someone in perfect health would get hurt falling off, let alone Esme with all her injuries! No wonder her wounds opened up again!

Quentin shot her a look and went on, "Honestly, it's kinda my fault too. I told her that Isabella had saved her life before, and this time she saved Isabella, so they were even. After that, she just lost it."

Isabella pressed her lips together, staying quiet.

Quentin added, "I just didn't want to give her too much hope, you know? Didn't want her to get let down later. Didn't think it would turn out like this."

Right then, a nurse came over. "Esme's family, she's about to come out. Please head to the debridement room entrance to meet her."

"Got it," Quentin replied, turning to leave but then paused and asked Isabella, "You wanna come with me?"

This time, Isabella didn't even think twice. She nodded. "Yeah, I'll go with you."

Isabella was the type to overthink everything, but only when she hadn't made peace with it yet. The fact that she rushed to the hospital after seeing that video showed she had already let go of most of her grudges.

Outside the debridement room.

Isabella and the others waited for like two minutes before Esme was wheeled out.

Esme was awake, but she looked like a ghost-pale face, sweaty hair sticking to her cheeks and scalp. She was a mess, nothing like the always elegant and beautiful Esme Isabella remembered.

"Bella." Esme's eyes lit up when she saw Isabella. She tried to reach out but couldn't because Isabella was too far away.

Isabella hesitated for a sec, then stepped forward and gently took Esme's hand.

Esme looked stunned, like she couldn't believe it, and tears started welling up in her eyes.

Back in the hospital room, Quentin and Sebastian made up some excuses to leave, giving Esme and Isabella some alone time.

Isabella gently rubbed her fingers.

"Bella," Esme called out, "Have you forgiven me?"

Isabella glanced at Esme and quickly looked away. Seeing Esme like this made her heart ache. She was quiet for a moment before softly saying, "Talking about forgiveness doesn't matter anymore."

Esme sighed, "Bella, I'm sorry. I had no other choice back then, which is why I left you and Nina behind and disappeared."

"Let's not talk about the past." Isabella bit her lip. "I never thought I'd see you again in my lifetime. Please don't harm yourself anymore."

Esme's eyes filled with tears. "Bella, I'm so happy, really so happy."

Esme was so overjoyed that she couldn't hold back her tears any longer and cried.

Seeing Esme like this made Isabella feel terrible too. She grabbed a couple of tissues and wiped Esme's tears. "Please don't cry. I'm a sucker for other people's tears."

"Alright, alright, it's my bad. I won't cry. Bella, you don't be sad either." Esme grabbed the tissues, quickly wiped her tears, and forced a smile to cheer Isabella up.

Esme had been stuck in the hospital for over a week, and during that time, Isabella visited almost every day, making their bond grow stronger.

When Nina found out about this, she was quiet for a long time.

"Nina, are you mad?" Isabella asked, a bit nervous.

"I'm not mad," Nina replied, "I'm happy for you that there's someone else to care for you."

Isabella said, "Thanks."

Nina was super busy, so they only chatted for a few minutes before hanging up.

Isabella came back to the hospital room with some warm water and found an extra person there.

A young girl in a white dress was hugging Esme. "Mom, what happened to you? How did you get hurt? I was so scared when Quentin told me!"

Esme gently patted the girl's back, trying to calm her down. "I'm fine; don't cry."

When she looked up and saw Isabella standing at the door, Esme's movements stiffened, and she seemed a bit lost.

Esme worried that seeing her being so gentle with Elodie would make Isabella feel bad. Esme paused and patted Elodie's shoulder. "Elodie, you're pressing on me."

Elodie quickly stood up. "Mom, are you alright? Did I hurt you somewhere?"

When Elodie turned and saw Isabella, she immediately frowned. She got up from the bed and pointed at the door. "What are you doing here? Get out! You're not welcome here!"

"Elodie," Esme tugged at Elodie's hand. "Don't talk to Bella like that. She's your sister."

"What did you say?" Elodie's eyes widened in shock, her gaze darting between Esme and Isabella. "Is she the one..."

Esme nodded solemnly. "Yes, it's her."

"How could it be her?" Elodie looked disgusted.

Esme softly said, "Elodie, she is your sister."

The next second, Elodie shook off Esme's hand, her face full of anger. "I will never regard her as my sister. Not everyone earns that title. I only have one sister! She's just a nobody, a bastard child."

Esme suddenly sat up from the bed and slapped Elodie across the face.

Elodie's face turned to the side from the slap. She held her burning cheek and looked at Esme in disbelief, her eyes quickly filling with tears, but she still looked defiant.

Seeing this, Esme's expression softened. "Elodie, I didn't mean to."

Before Esme could explain, Elodie turned and ran out of the room.

Esme sighed softly.

Isabella walked over and handed Esme the warm water. "Here, drink this."

"Okay." Esme forced a smile.

Isabella sat down beside her. "You don't have to make her do anything. For me, I just want to acknowledge you as my mother. The rest of the Black family has nothing to do with me."

Esme took her hand, guilt filling her eyes. "I'm sorry, Bella. I didn't raise Elodie well. I'll talk to her and make her apologize to you."

Isabella lowered her eyes, smiling. "It's nothing."

But deep down, Isabella still felt a bit upset. She couldn't help but think that Esme was still more partial to Elodie.

###chapter 344  Want to Give It a Try?

Night rolled in.

Richard cruised home and spotted a sleek figure on the second-floor windowsill from a distance.

He grinned, killed the engine, and bounded upstairs.

When Richard swung the door open, the room lights cut out, the window flew open, and the mountain breeze whipped Elodie's skirt around.

Richard saw that figure step onto the windowsill, glance back at him, and then move like she was about to jump.

"Nina!" Richard's heart skipped a beat, and he bolted over. Without a second thought, he hopped onto the windowsill and grabbed her.

With Elodie in his arms, Richard clung to the window frame. They dangled in mid-air, in a super close and awkward position.

"Nina." Richard looked down at Elodie, but his face changed when he saw her clearly.

The sound of a car engine came from below. Nina drove into the yard and saw the dramatic scene on the second-floor windowsill from afar.

Richard was in black, and Elodie wore a soft white nightgown. They looked like a pair of star-crossed lovers!

Nina got out of the car, shut the door, looked up for a few seconds, then got back in and drove away from Richard's yard.

"Nina!" Richard shouted.

But he could only watch as Nina's car disappeared from view.

"Richard." Elodie clung to him, her arms around his neck. "I'm so sad. Mom hit me today for some outsider! Look, my face is still swollen!"

As she spoke, Elodie whimpered.

Richard frowned, barely hearing a word Elodie said. He pulled on the window frame, and they managed to get back into the room.

As soon as his feet hit the ground, Richard pushed Elodie away and turned to leave.

Richard thought, 'I gotta go after Nina! She must've totally misunderstood that scene!'

Elodie lunged from behind, hugging his waist tightly. "Richard, don't go. Don't leave me alone. I'm so sad and upset, stay with me, please?"

Richard's body stiffened. He said coldly, "Let go!"

"I won't!" Elodie shook her head, crying. "If I let go, you'll go find that Nina! What's so great about her? Whatever she can give you, I can too. Look at me, touch me, and I promise to make you happy."

Elodie felt a sharp pain in her fingers as Richard pried them open one by one, almost like he wanted to break them.

Elodie couldn't bear the pain and let go after a few seconds.

Richard turned back, giving her a cold stare. "Guess your time in the dungeon wasn't enough!"

Elodie bit her lip. "Richard, if you dare treat me like this, I'll tell Dad! If he finds out you locked me up, he'll skin you alive!"

Richard sneered. "Go ahead. Tell him!"

With that, Richard grabbed a long coat from the rack and stormed out.

By the time Elodie got downstairs, Richard had already driven off.

She clutched her wrist and stomped her foot in frustration. "Richard, you'll be mine sooner or later!"

Richard chased Nina all the way to the Nina and Isabella Jewelry Company.

The lights in the building were bright. When he went in, Nina was sitting at her desk, looking through some documents.

She was so wrapped up in her work that she didn't even notice him barging in.

There were still folks burning the midnight oil in the outer office. Richard locked the door, pulled down the blinds, and then swooped in to lift Nina out of her chair.

Nina, still clutching her documents, was caught off guard. She blinked at him. "Richard, what are you doing here?"

Richard locked eyes with her. "I followed you."

Nina looked a bit puzzled. "Is there something you need? You didn't have to come all the way here; you could've just called."

Richard didn't say a word, just narrowed his eyes, giving her a deep, intense look.

Nina was thrown off by Richard's stare. "What's up?"

Nina was rocking a pencil skirt that day, showing off her curves. Richard's hand instinctively moved to her hips. "You mad?"

Nina replied, "No, I'm not."

"Really?" Richard's hand roamed over her hips, slow and teasing. "It wasn't what it looked like. Why didn't you let me explain and just walked away? Is that all the trust we have?"

Nina pressed down on Richard's wandering hand, her cheeks flushing. "I'm really not mad. I turned back earlier because I had a great design idea and wanted to sketch it out."

Richard clearly wasn't buying it.

As he spoke, he slowly lifted Nina's skirt. "You saw me hugging another woman and didn't get jealous, but thought about design? Nina, you're something else!"

Richard placed Nina on the desk, spread her legs, and leaned in for a kiss.

Nina had to tilt her head back to kiss him.

Just then, someone knocked on the office door, and a voice came from outside. "Ms. Miller, are you there? The initial design draft you requested is ready. Can I bring it in for you to review?"

Nina had just pushed Richard away when he grabbed the back of her head and deepened the kiss.

Richard's dominance almost overwhelmed Nina.

But she still had a bit of rationality left. She gathered her strength and pushed hard against Richard's chest, finally getting him to back off a little.

Afraid he'd kiss her again, Nina immediately lowered her head, resting her forehead on his chin.

Richard's breathing was heavy, and he still held Nina tightly. "Nina, you really drive me crazy!"

Richard never hid his feelings, always straightforward.

Even though Nina had heard similar words countless times, she still felt embarrassed.

Nina caught her breath and said, "Stop it. This is the office!"

"So what if it's the office?" Richard lowered his head, his fingers brushing her sensitive spots. Seeing her shiver, he smiled with satisfaction. "I locked the door and pulled the blinds. Even if I pressed you against the window, no one would notice. Nina, wanna try?"

Nina glared at him, her tone more serious. "I still have work to do. Can you wait until I'm done?"

Richard pinched her cheek. "Okay. I'll wait inside."

With that, he kissed her cheek again, then walked into the lounge behind her.

Nina rubbed her temples, feeling a headache. Richard's desires were sometimes really hard to handle.

###chapter 345 Looking for Trouble

"Hey, Ms. Miller," the assistant strolled in, juggling a stack of papers. "Got all the stuff you asked for."

Nina gave a nod. "Thanks, appreciate it."

"No biggie," the assistant shrugged, genuinely. "Oh, by the way, Ms. Murphy just came by. She wants to see you."

"Ms. Murphy?" Nina squinted, trying to place the name. The company was new, and they were hustling to expand their network. Nina and Isabella Jewelry had burst onto the scene, catching the eye of Esme, a big-shot international jeweler, which really boosted their rep. Even before Nina could dive into that world, folks were already lining up to connect.

Nina usually played the good host, inviting people in and treating them right, sticking to the usual script.

Thinking this Murphy lady might be from the jewelry world, Nina asked, "Did she say where she's from?"

The assistant nodded. "Yeah, she said she's with Harmony Jewelry."

"Harmony Jewelry?" Nina's eyes lit up.

That was her go-to jewelry spot from her old job. The designer there was this young woman Nina had seen on posters-gorgeous and super talented. Her designs were always thoughtful and had this independent vibe.

You could often tell a lot about someone from their designs. Nina had a soft spot for Harmony Jewelry and a ton of respect for its designer, Vilma.

Nina had been planning to visit them once things calmed down, but she didn't expect Harmony Jewelry to make the first move.

Nina quickly told the assistant, "Invite her in, please."

"Sure thing." The assistant was about to leave when Nina stopped her. "Wait! I'll go greet her myself."

The assistant raised an eyebrow. "Ms. Miller, you really dig Harmony Jewelry, huh?"

Nina smiled. "It's my favorite brand, and their pieces have inspired me a lot."

Honestly, Harmony Jewelry was like a mentor to Nina in the design world. So, of course, she had to greet her mentor personally.

Buzzing with excitement, Nina headed to the first floor and spotted a middle-aged woman sitting in a booth, looking a bit impatient.

The woman wore a black dress, not too fancy but not shabby either. But her jewelry? Definitely Harmony Jewelry.

Nina walked up and extended her hand. "Hi, I'm Nina Miller, head of Nina and Isabella Jewelry."

The woman shook her hand lightly. "I'm Ophelia Murphy."

"Nice to meet you. Wanna come upstairs?" Nina asked, all enthusiastic.

Ophelia, though, seemed pretty chill. She gave Nina a once-over, then nodded and followed her to the elevator.

As soon as the elevator doors shut, Nina caught a whiff of Ophelia's perfume. She frowned a bit, sure it was coming from Ophelia.

But since Ophelia was a guest and it was their first meet, Nina decided to keep her thoughts to herself.

Once they hit the office, Nina asked the assistant to whip up some tea.

Ophelia waved it off. "I only drink bottled water, thanks."

Nina blinked, a bit thrown off, but then told the assistant to get it, smiling. "Ms. Murphy, you must really care about your health and looks."

Ophelia didn't even flinch at the compliment, still cool as a cucumber. "People who chug tea and coffee get pigment deposits. Might not show when they're young, but they'll age fast later. So, I stick to water."

Nina was a bit puzzled, her eyes showing it.

Ophelia caught the look and frowned. "Is there a problem?"

"Nope," Nina quickly smiled. "No problem at all. What you said makes a lot of sense. It's the first time I've heard it, and it's pretty eye-opening."

Ophelia gave a faint smile. "Ms. Miller, you're not that young anymore, right? Just a little friendly advice-take care of yourself. That youthful glow won't last forever.."

Nina was speechless. Why did Ophelia's words feel like a slap?

The assistant brought in two bottles of water and placed them in front of Ophelia at Nina's nod.

"Ms. Murphy, sorry for the basic hospitality," Nina stayed polite. "Please, have some water."

Ophelia barely glanced at it and said, "I forgot to mention, I have specific requirements for my purified water. With such a big name and a fancy company, how come you can't even serve top-quality bottled water? Are you really trying to impress clients and friends with this average stuff?"

Nina was speechless. She finally got it. Ophelia wasn't here to be friendly; she was here to stir the pot.

"Sorry," Nina was about to throw out a polite lie to smooth things over.

After all, every visitor was a guest, whether they came to make friends or to stir up trouble. She'd welcome them with a smile and see them off the same way.

But Ophelia had other plans.

Ophelia cut her off, "Ms. Miller, I'm here on behalf of Harmony Jewelry. Are you planning to monopolize the entire Lakina jewelry market with Esme's help, leaving no room for others? Ms. Miller, you're young and ruthless, but aren't you afraid of future backlash?"

Nina was stunned. "Ms. Murphy, what are you talking about? I've never thought about monopolizing the jewelry industry, nor have I relied on anyone or targeted anyone. This is our first personal meeting, and our companies' first interaction. Your words really confuse me; I'm totally lost."

"Really?" Ophelia pulled out her phone, tapped a few times, and handed it to Nina. "Take a look for yourself."

###chapter 346  Forgot

Ophelia's phone flashed a surveillance video. It was from the main store of Harmony Jewelry, showing Isabella bumping into Esme a few days back.

The video caught Esme standing up for Isabella, giving Malin a piece of her mind, and then storming out with Isabella, saying they were done with Harmony Jewelry.

After watching, Nina got the gist of what went down. She handed the phone back to Ophelia and said, "Look, Ms. Murphy, I don't know what kicked this off, but I can vouch for Isabella. She's not the type to bully for kicks. Honestly, you need to keep a tighter leash on your staff. In this biz, besides design, isn't reputation everything? If one of my employees disrespected a customer, I'd make them apologize on the spot. If it wasn't too bad, they'd get a warning; if it was serious, they'd be out. No way I'd put up with that crap!"

Ophelia chuckled. "Ms. Miller, nice try at dodging the issue. As you mentioned, Harmony Jewelry already canned her. But why did your sister, Isabella, push Esme to ditch Harmony Jewelry, Ms. Miller? Can you honestly say you had nothing to do with it? Isabella's your sister; why would she buy jewelry from Harmony Jewelry instead of from you? And it just so happened to be the day Esme was meeting with Harmony Jewelry. Is all this really a coincidence, Ms. Miller? Or was it a well-planned move?"

Ophelia's breakdown left Nina speechless.

Nina said, "Believe it or not, this wasn't something Isabella and I cooked up."

Ophelia sneered. "Then tell me, Ms. Miller, if Isabella wasn't trying to mess things up, why was Esme so dead set on not giving Harmony Jewelry another shot?"

Nina said, "Sorry, I don't know Esme that well, so I can't answer that."

Ophelia stood up. "Nathaniel from our family was a key player who helped Sebastian when it mattered. I didn't know you were so ungrateful."

Whenever Isabella and Sebastian came up, Nina couldn't help but defend them. "I'm not up to speed on Landon Group's stuff, but Mr. Nelson's actions during their rough patch-were they really above board?"

Ophelia was stumped.

Nina lowered her eyes, dialing back her sharpness. "Sorry, Ms. Murphy, I didn't want things to go this way. But I guess we're just not meant to be friends."

Ophelia's eyes were full of disdain. "Do you think I want to be friends with you? You and Isabella are just riding on men's coattails. I've looked into you both. Before Isabella hooked up with Sebastian, she was just a broke college student, and you were just a regular woman! Without them, would you be where you are today? Would you even have the right to talk to me?"

Ophelia's sharpness and condescending attitude were unbearable.

At this point, there was no use in continuing the conversation. Nina's face darkened as she turned to her assistant. "Show her out."

"Alright, Ms. Miller." The assistant walked over and swung the office door open. "Ms. Murphy, this way, please."

"I'll leave!" Ophelia snatched her bag, pointed a finger at Nina, and stormed out. That finger? Total declaration of war.

The beef with Harmony Jewelry was now set in stone.

After seeing Ophelia off, Nina couldn't shake off her words. "You and Isabella are just riding on men's coattails. Without them, could you still be where you are today?"

Isabella was a top-notch student. Her thing with Sebastian wasn't some master plan, just a twist of fate. Even without Sebastian, with Bella's hustle, she'd still be killing it.

As for Nina, she built this company. Sure, Richard helped a ton, but it wasn't just him; the Jose family had her back too. Now, it was all on her.

Nina clenched her fists. One day, she'd show them all!

For now, she just had to grind and keep pushing forward!

Nina's office decor? All Richard's doing. Especially the lounge inside, almost entirely his handiwork.

The original design was basic, but Richard jazzed it up. Especially the walls, which had killer soundproofing. No matter how loud things got inside, no one would hear a peep.

Richard opened the wardrobe, which had both his and Nina's clothes hanging together, their scents mingling.

He grabbed a robe and headed for a shower.

Afterward, he came out and waited for Nina. During this time, Michael called to say Elodie had trashed his villa.

Richard just shrugged it off, "Who cares? Let her." Then he hung up.

Because of Bruno, Richard had to put up with Elodie. When he couldn't take it anymore, he'd deal with it.

But Richard hoped Elodie would back off after hitting some walls; otherwise, he and Nina would have more headaches.

As Richard was mulling this over, the phone rang again.

He picked it up and saw it was Michael again.

Richard frowned and answered, "What now? Couldn't you say it all at once?"

Michael laughed, "Richard, come out for a drink? It's been ages since you joined us. We all miss you."

In the background, a chorus of voices chimed in. "Richard, come drink with us. We're waiting for you."

Richard didn't hesitate. "Can't make it."

Michael said, "Why not? Is Nina not letting you? No way, does Nina have you on that tight a leash? Richard, are you really whipped?"

Richard pulled the phone away from his ear and said, "I like being whipped!"

Then he hung up amidst a burst of laughter.

Richard sneered. Those single guys would never get his current happiness. What's so great about drinking?

He wanted to wait for Nina and have some fun together.

But Richard waited forever, even took a nap, and woke up still alone.

No noise outside.

When Richard opened the door, he found the room empty, even the lights were off.

Nina had forgotten him! She left him at the company and locked him in the office!

###chapter 347 Fear

Hospital.

After the doc did his rounds, a couple of cops rolled in and took a quick statement.

Isabella, all chill, asked about Siena and found out from the cops that Siena was locked up for intentional injury. Lucky for Esme, her injuries weren't too bad, but whether to press charges or not was up to Esme.

Esme was like, "I'll think about it."

The cops nodded and Quentin showed them out.

"Bella," Esme grabbed Isabella's hand, pulling her to sit by the bed. "You thinking about letting Siena off the hook?"

Isabella was caught off guard, not expecting Esme to be so blunt.

Esme gave her a smile. "If that knife had hit you, no way I'd let her off easy. I know about her and Sebastian, and how she put herself on the line for you before. I get that you feel like you owe her. If you wanna pay her back, I'll back you up."

Isabella shook her head. "You don't need to put yourself out for us. Just let things play out."

Esme said, "Bella, I'm your mom. Your stuff and Sebastian's stuff are my stuff too. How can I not care?"

Isabella looked down. "Siena's way too intense. Lucky you're okay this time. If something had happened to you, no one could save her. Maybe this'll teach her a lesson. So, Esme, don't worry about me and Sebastian. We won't butt in. Whatever you decide, we're cool with it."

Esme looked at Isabella, her eyes all mixed up, and finally sighed. "Bella, won't you call me mom?"

Even though Esme had been in the hospital for days and Isabella visited every day, chatting and all, Isabella never called her mom.

This made Esme feel kinda off. She really wanted to hear Isabella call her mom. But she got that Isabella needed time and she couldn't push it.

Right then, Quentin walked in with a young guy in a suit carrying a briefcase.

Quentin said, "Mom, Bella, this is attorney Gerald Morgan."

Esme's face changed a bit. "Why'd you get a lawyer so fast? Didn't we say we'd wait till I got better?"

Quentin said, "We gotta deal with this sooner or later, and dragging it out ain't good. Mr. Morgan was in Silvercrest and came here just for your case."

Esme frowned. "No rush. Let's wait till I'm better."

Isabella glanced at her. For some reason, she felt like Esme was dodging Gerald. Or maybe she was dodging Quentin's plan.

Isabella thought Quentin would tell Gerald to leave after Esme said that, but he didn't. Quentin paused and said, "I've been keeping this injury thing on the down-low. To avoid Bruno finding out, I called Mr. Morgan. You still have a choice now, but if Bruno Black sends someone, it'll be out of our hands. Mom, think it over."

Quentin's last line had a bit of a threat to it.

Esme's eyes flickered, and she softened up.

But Isabella could still tell she wasn't too happy.

Isabella turned to Quentin and Gerald. "She just switched meds and gave her statement to the cops. She hasn't had a chance to rest. Mr. Black, can Aunt Esme get a quick break before talking to Mr. Morgan?"

Quentin stared at her for a few seconds, then nodded. "Alright."

He gave Gerald a look, and Gerald nodded and left.

Quentin grabbed his coat from the sofa, said he had something to handle, and took off.

As soon as he was gone, Esme let out a big sigh and totally relaxed.

Isabella saw it all but didn't say anything. She just grabbed an apple from the fruit basket and started peeling it.

Esme watched her, feeling like time slowed down, and she started to feel more patient and calm.

Isabella cut the apple into small pieces, put them on a plate, and handed it to Esme.

Esme sighed. "It's rare to see someone so gentle after growing up without parents."

"My personality's mostly thanks to Nina," Isabella said.

Esme nodded. "Yeah. You and Nina have had it tough all these years."

In the afternoon, Sebastian came to pick up Isabella, bringing a fruit basket and flowers for Esme.

Esme smiled. "We're family. No need to be so formal."

Sebastian glanced at Isabella and said, "You're our elder. It's only right to show respect."

Isabella stood up, brushed some water droplets off his shoulder, and glanced at the gray window. "Is it raining hard?"

Sebastian held her hand, his voice soft. "Not really. There was a traffic jam downstairs, so I didn't let Jack drive in. I walked over and got a bit wet. No big deal."

As he spoke, his fingers gently rubbed Isabella's, warming her hands.

Esme watched them, feeling comforted by their love.

She glanced out the window and said, "It's getting late. You still have to take care of Sweetie when you get home. You should go."

Sebastian said, "No rush. I already sent Sweetie to the Jose family. Bella and I will have dinner with you tonight."

There was a restaurant downstairs, but considering Esme's health, Sebastian had the food delivered directly.

Esme was staying in the fanciest suite, which had a dining room, living room, and even a kitchen outside the hospital room. All the appliances were top-notch.

The three of them had dinner at the dining table. Esme was in a good mood and ate a bit more than usual.

Afterward, Isabella and Sebastian said goodbye and left the hospital.

In the car, Isabella seemed a bit distracted.

Sebastian leaned over and draped his coat over her shoulders. "What's up? You've seemed off since I saw you this afternoon."

Isabella looked at him. "Sebastian, why do I feel like Aunt Esme is scared of Quentin?"

Sebastian paused. "What do you mean?"

Isabella recounted the afternoon's events.

Sebastian said, "From what I know, that Bruno Black isn't exactly a nice guy. It might be like Quentin said, if he finds out about this, things could get ugly."

Isabella asked, "How ugly?"

Sebastian replied, "Siena might end up dead."

Isabella was stunned. "Aunt Esme's injury isn't serious enough for Siena to get the death penalty."

Sebastian said quietly, "There are plenty of ways to die besides the death penalty."

Isabella broke out in a cold sweat hearing that.

###chapter 348 Like Surveillance

Sebastian added, "Quentin ain't Esme's real kid. I had someone dig around in Silvercrest, and turns out Quentin was around before Esme even hooked up with Bruno Black. So, Esme's just his stepmom."

Isabella nodded, not even phased by the news.

Most of the time, Quentin seemed respectful towards Esme, but it was kinda overwhelming.

Quentin being around didn't feel like protection; it felt more like he was keeping tabs on her!

If it was surveillance, Bruno must've set it up. But why would Bruno wanna keep an eye on Esme? Was he scared she'd find another dude?

But Esme had crazy high standards. Isabella figured a woman like Esme, with her age and status, wouldn't be into just any random guy. Plus, Esme said she came back just to reunite with her daughter.

Two days later, Esme got out of the hospital.

Quentin suggested Esme crash at his place. It'd be easier to take care of her and she could see Isabella every day.

Esme got what he was hinting at and agreed.

On the way back, Isabella asked, "I heard the cops dropped the charges against Siena?"

"Yeah," Esme replied, "Bella, I can't do much for you and Sebastian. Since Siena's Sebastian's sister and she's helped you before, I can repay this favor for you. At least this way, you won't owe her anything. She's got a chance now. If she keeps being stubborn, I'll be the first to call her out."

Even though Isabella thought it was kinda off, the matter was settled, so she didn't say much more.

As the car rolled back, they saw Laura pushing a baby stroller in the yard, soaking up the sun.

"Who's that?" Esme frowned, thinking Isabella had hired another young nanny. She worriedly said, "Bella, it's not that I have anything against young people, but if you need a nanny, get someone older and more reliable. Don't go for someone like Siena again."

Isabella knew Esme got it wrong and quickly explained, "Don't worry. That's just an employee from Sebastian's company, helping out temporarily. Margaret said once she's better, she'll help me with the baby again."

During her hospital stay, Esme had heard Isabella mention Margaret a few times.

Hearing Isabella now, Esme looked guilty. "I gotta visit her personally to thank her for taking care of you and Sweetie."

Isabella smiled. "There'll be a chance."

After getting out of the car, Quentin helped Esme inside while Isabella turned back to play with Sweetie.

When Isabella looked up, she saw Laura staring at Quentin's door.

Caught by Isabella, Laura smiled awkwardly. "Bella, who's that hottie?"

Isabella said, "Quentin Black."

"Oh, he's so handsome." Laura's smile was a bit shy.

Laura used to be a hopeless romantic, but after getting played by a jerk, she was over it. It had been a while since a guy caught her eye.

Laura wasn't head over heels, just thought Quentin was decent!

Isabella glanced in that direction, then looked at Laura with some concern. "Laura, he's not someone you can handle."

Laura blushed. "Alright, alright. Chill out. Since you said so, I won't push it. I'll drop it here!"

Isabella was genuinely happy for Laura, who could be so straightforward and stay clear-headed.

"I'm gonna check something over there. Can you watch Sweetie for a bit? I'll be right back," Isabella instructed.

"Sure," Laura said, pushing the stroller. "I'll take Sweetie inside for a bit. Too much sun ain't good either."

Quentin's house was huge, and maybe 'cause he lived alone, it was pretty bare, making it feel super empty.

When Isabella walked in, Quentin was wearing an apron, cooking something.

Seeing her, Quentin said, "Mom's upstairs. Want me to take you up?"

"No need." Isabella waved her hand. When she caught a whiff of something nice, she asked, "What are you cooking?"

"Tea." Quentin smiled at her. "You go up first. I'll bring it up later."

Isabella nodded. "Okay."

Watching Isabella head upstairs, Quentin turned back to brewing tea.

Isabella followed the stairs up and soon found Esme.

Esme was packing stuff, and the bedroom door was half-open, with voices coming from inside.

Isabella paused slightly, realizing there were others in Quentin's house.

As she paused, the conversation inside became clear.

Elodie said, "Mom, are you still gonna defend her? I know everything. If it weren't for saving her, you wouldn't be in this condition. She almost got you killed!"

Esme said, "Elodie, don't talk about Bella like that! No matter what, she's your sister. This was just an accident."

Elodie said, "I don't want a sister like her. If Quentin hadn't stopped me, I would've told Dad about this long ago!"

Esme shouted, "Elodie!"

Isabella didn't want to listen anymore.

She didn't have the habit of eavesdropping and knew that showing up now would mess up the vibe inside.

Without making a sound, Isabella turned to go downstairs.

A cat's meow caught Isabella's attention.

Turning around, she saw the cat. In just a week, the cat that had been on the brink of death was now lively. Seeing her, Cheese arched its back, fur standing on end, ready to fight, just like it had been with Siena at Isabella's house.

"Cheese!" A deep voice called out.

Hearing the voice, Cheese immediately became docile, lazily stretching and walking past Isabella to sit at Quentin's feet.

Quentin, holding a tea set, smiled apologetically at Isabella. "Did it scare you? Cheese, like people, lacks a sense of security. It's not familiar with you, so it acted that way. Don't take it to heart."

"Okay." Isabella shook her head.

Isabella wasn't petty enough to hold a grudge against a cat.

Isabella asked, "What did you call it?"

Quentin said, "Cheese."

Isabella retorted, "Cheese?"

Quentin nodded. "Yep."

"Sounds delicious." Isabella laughed. "I thought you'd give it a heroic name. Didn't expect such a cute one, like a girl's pet."

Quentin lowered his eyes. He smiled, "Just a random name, don't overthink it."

Watching Cheese sit obediently at his feet, Isabella felt an inexplicable sense of eeriness despite the harmonious scene.

###chapter 349 The Repaired Bracelet

"Yo, what's up?" Quentin cut in, snapping Isabella out of her thoughts.

Isabella looked away. "Oh, nothing. Just feels like it really likes you."

Quentin squatted down, freed a hand, grabbed a cat treat from his pocket, and fed it to Cheese. He gently petted its fur and said, "Probably 'cause I saved its life."

Isabella nodded. Made sense. Cheese was in rough shape back then, and Quentin had come to the rescue. Cats are smart like that, so no wonder Cheese trusted him.

"Quentin!" Elodie hollered as she came downstairs, spotting Quentin and Isabella chatting.

Quentin just glanced up at her, not saying a word.

Elodie shot a look at Isabella. "Who let you in here? Get out! We don't want you here!"

"Elodie!" Quentin barked, his voice stern. "Don't talk to Bella like that!"

"Bella, Bella, Bella! I think you're all under her spell!" Elodie fumed.

Quentin's face darkened. "Keep that up, and you can stop coming over!"

"Quentin!" Elodie whined, trying to be cute.

But Quentin's face stayed stone-cold.

A bit scared of Quentin, Elodie backed down but didn't apologize to Isabella. She stomped her foot and plopped onto the couch, sulking.

Quentin handed the tea set to Isabella. "Bella, head upstairs and chat with Mom."

Isabella got the hint that Quentin wanted to deal with Elodie alone.

She took the tea set. "Alright."

Giving them space, Isabella carried the tea set upstairs.

As soon as Isabella was out of sight, Quentin turned to Elodie.

"Get up!" Quentin demanded, his face stern.

Elodie looked up, seeing Quentin's icy stare, and felt uneasy. She stood up, her earlier bravado gone. "Quentin, are you gonna scold me like Mom, all for some outsider?"

Quentin's face was unreadable. "Mom should've told you, Bella's not an outsider. She's your sister."

Elodie bit her lip, snapping back, "I only have one sister, and she's lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to an oxygen tube. She's practically a living dead, and you and Mom have given up on her!"

Quentin's frown deepened. "Elodie, I'm warning you, be nice to Isabella!"

"Why?" Elodie was baffled.

Quentin glanced upstairs, lowering his voice. "You don't need to get it. Just know that Isabella is your sister. Whether you like it or not, that's a fact. And soon, she'll be part of the Black Family. Bruno's on board with this. Throwing a fit won't change anything!"

Elodie was stunned. "Dad knows about this too?"

Quentin didn't answer and walked away.

Elodie felt it was absurd! No way! She couldn't accept Isabella as her sister! And she definitely couldn't let Isabella join the Black Family!

Elodie clenched her fists, a wicked idea forming in her mind.

Dinner was cooked by Quentin, with Elodie helping out.

Sebastian showed up right after work, carrying Sweetie.

Esme seemed super happy, constantly piling food onto Isabella's plate, though Isabella didn't eat much.

Isabella served Esme a bowl of soup. "Aunt Esme, you should eat too. Don't just serve me."

Seeing Isabella and Esme getting along so well, Quentin looked pretty pleased, while Elodie just sat there with a sour face, staying quiet.

Catching the good vibes, Sebastian pulled something out of his pocket.

Isabella squinted and was a bit shocked. "Wait, isn't that..."

It was the bracelet Isabella had tossed earlier. The one Esme had given her.

Back then, Isabella was so mad she chucked it out the car window.

But Sebastian had picked it up, got it fixed, and now it looked brand new.

Sebastian said, "I saw you went back to look for it twice, so I knew you couldn't really let it go. Honestly, from the moment you threw it away, I knew you'd regret it, so I had Jack go back and find it. It got run over by a car and took days to repair. Some details might be different. Aunt Esme, check it out. If anything's off, we can get it fixed again."

Sebastian's tone was both polite and respectful. By bringing out the bracelet now, he was not only patching things up between Esme and Isabella but also showing Esme that he had Isabella's back, no matter what!

Esme took the bracelet and looked it over, her smile full of satisfaction. "This bracelet was my design, and the draft was never shared. So it's normal the patterns aren't exactly the same. The repair work is top-notch. Who did this?"

Sebastian glanced at Isabella. "A craftsman from Nina and Isabella Jewelry. Nina drew the repair draft and oversaw the whole process."

Isabella's eyelashes fluttered. She thought, 'No one in this world treats me better than Nina.'

Esme was also impressed. "I didn't expect Nina to have such a knack for jewelry design. She's got real potential!"

Elodie, listening on the side, rolled her eyes and almost lost her cool.

Sebastian said, "If everything's good, Aunt Esme, could you help Bella put it back on?"

"Of course. It's my pleasure." Esme's eyes welled up as she helped Isabella put the bracelet back on.

Quentin watched, his eyes flickering slightly. "Mom, don't you have another gift for Bella?"

"Yes." Esme took a document from Quentin. "Bella, sign this. It's my gift to you."

Isabella opened it and saw a few words: [Share Transfer Agreement!]

Isabella asked, "What's this?"

Esme said, "These are the Landon Group shares I bought from Nathaniel. Remember, Bella? When we met at Blue Horizon Cafe, I said this was my gift to my daughter."

But back then, Esme didn't have the guts to tell Isabella she was her daughter. Now the time was right, and she had to give what she should.

Isabella waved her hand. "I can't accept this."

Esme put the pen in her hand. "Bella, all I can give you are these material things. I hope they give you enough confidence. You have to accept them."

Quentin chimed in, "Take it, Bella. It's a token of Mom's love."

Elodie glared but kept her mouth shut.

Isabella finally signed the transfer agreement.

Quentin watched her sign, a subtle emotion flickering in his dark eyes.

###chapter 350  Eighty-One Cuts

Night rolled in, blanketing the city in darkness.

As the lights flickered on, the bar got even rowdier.

Out of nowhere, Siena got shoved out, and this tatted-up dude pointed right at her nose, yelling, "Bitch, you think you can steal from our boss? You looking for trouble?"

With that, he signaled to his two goons.

They grabbed Siena from both sides and dragged her into a nearby alley.

Moments later, her screams pierced the night.

After what felt like forever, the two guys strutted out, adjusting their pants.

Their faces were sleazy, and their words were even worse.

"Didn't think she'd be that good."

"Shame she ain't a virgin. Such a pretty face, wasted."

As they kept talking, two dark figures suddenly appeared in front of them. Before they knew it, black bags dropped over their heads, and they were totally disoriented.

In the dim alley, the sound of footsteps echoed. Leather shoes hitting the ground, splashing through puddles.

Siena sat disheveled in a filthy corner, next to a stinking garbage can. She looked out of it, staring blankly ahead.

It wasn't until a beam of light hit her eyes that she instinctively shut them.

When she opened her eyes again, she saw the two guys who had just assaulted her lying in front of her!

They were beaten to a pulp, faces all messed up, hands and feet tied, mouths taped shut. They looked terrified, writhing on the ground like worms, making pathetic noises.

Seeing them, Siena remembered her humiliation. She grabbed her hair, eyes burning with hatred.

A knife with a cold gleam suddenly dropped to the ground. Siena looked up, dazed, and saw a noble and arrogant face.

"Want to kill them?" Quentin looked down at her with a godlike presence.

Siena stared at him, her gaze trembling, fingernails digging into the ground, but she didn't move.

Quentin squatted down in front of her, looking at her with pity. "I'll give you one chance. Kill them or let them go, your call."

Siena slowly lowered her eyes, replaying his words in her mind. "Kill them or let them go?"

The two guys, now tightly bound, realized how screwed they were. They desperately wanted to say something, but their mouths were taped shut, and they could only squirm frantically.

They didn't try to appease Siena or beg her for mercy. Instead, they wriggled to Quentin's feet, rubbing their faces against his shoes, trying to show submission and beg for mercy.

Quentin stood there silently.

Suddenly, Siena grabbed the knife handle, gripping it tightly.

She slowly stood up, walked to the two men, raised the knife high, and then brought it down hard. The blade repeatedly pierced their flesh, Siena looking like an emotionless reaper, unmoved by their relentless pleas, never stopping her brutal assault.

It wasn't until the two dudes stopped moving, no more sounds or breaths, that Siena finally stopped. She plopped down next to the cold corpses, her face smeared with blood, looking numb.

Quentin squatted in front of her. "Nice job."

Siena stared at him, eyes empty.

Quentin smirked. "Don't sweat it. I'll handle everything. From now on, your life is mine."

The next morning, Isabella and Sebastian were munching on breakfast when the news about the murder popped up on TV.

Even though a lot of it was blurred out, the host's description and the bloodstains in the alley made it clear this was some serious horror show.

When the host mentioned the two victims had eighty-one stab wounds, Isabella felt a wave of nausea, almost losing her breakfast.

Sebastian turned off the TV, walked over, and gently patted her back. "Next time, let's skip the news during breakfast."

Isabella took the water Sebastian handed her, rinsed her mouth, and lost her appetite completely.

Isabella thought, 'Eighty-one stab wounds? They were practically chopped to pieces.'

Isabella usually couldn't even handle slaughtering a chicken. She couldn't imagine stabbing someone, let alone eighty-one times! Just thinking about it made her feel sick.

Because of the news, Isabella was distracted all morning.

After Sebastian left for work, Esme came over to visit.

The courtyard was bathed in glorious sunlight. Isabella asked Esme to watch over Sweetie while she headed to the kitchen to slice some fruit.

When Isabella came out with the fruit platter, she found Sweetie and Esme were gone.

Isabella panicked, ran a few steps forward, and then saw Esme holding Sweetie, looking at the roses in the corner.

Esme turned around and saw Isabella's pale face. She walked back with Sweetie. "Bella, you okay? You look so pale."

"I'm fine." Isabella shook her head.

Taking advantage of Quentin's absence, Isabella tentatively asked Esme, "How long you planning to stay in Lakina this time?"

Esme paused while reaching for the fruit. "I was thinking a month. But now, a month doesn't seem enough. Bella, if I asked you to come back to Silvercrest with me, would you?"

Isabella shook her head. "Nope."

Esme was stunned but still insisted, "Why? Don't you want to be with me?"

Isabella said, "You've seen it; my family and friends are all here in Lakina. If I leave, it means being really separated from them. I'm slow to warm up to new places, and it would take me forever to adapt."

Esme nodded understandingly. "I get it. But Bella, what if I just ask you to visit once in a while? The kid is still young, and I have friends in Silvercrest who want to meet you. Most importantly, I really want you to meet Bruno Black."

Isabella lowered her gaze and said softly, "I have no interest in meeting the Black Family, nor do I want to waste energy pleasing anyone. So, sorry, but I'm not going with you."

Esme didn't expect Isabella to refuse her so directly. A flash of unease and disappointment crossed her face, but she didn't push further.

###chapter 351  If You Want to Cry, Don't Hold It In

Isabella had been all about soaking up every moment with Esme lately, probably 'cause she knew Esme was about to bounce back to Silvercrest.

Isabella didn't grill Esme about her Silvercrest adventures, but she had a pretty good hunch about what went down. She got that, despite Esme's flashy life, it hadn't been a walk in the park for her.

Esme didn't whine to Isabella; she just hung out with her and Sweetie every day. She went on a shopping spree for Sweetie, filling up a whole room with stuff, like she was trying to make up for lost time when Bella was a kid.

Isabella could feel Esme's real-deal kindness, and she quietly took in everything Esme gave her. Isabella and Sebastian would also brainstorm on what to get for Esme in return. And then, something wild happened.

Just a few days back, Isabella heard Nina talking about landing a big contract. But right after they signed it, they got slapped with a lawsuit. The other side claimed Nina's design was a rip-off.

For someone who creates original stuff, getting called out for plagiarism is the worst. Plus, Nina and Isabella Jewelry had just opened shop and were still the new kids on the block. If they got hit with this kind of dirt, their rep would be trashed. They'd always be tagged as copycats, getting shade thrown at them left and right.

Isabella knew Nina couldn't have done something like that; she was probably set up.

Just as Richard was about to dig into it, a lawyer from Harmony Jewelry showed up with a court summons. They wanted Nina and Isabella Jewelry to cough up fifteen million bucks for their losses. That's when Nina realized Harmony Jewelry had played them.

If Nina couldn't prove her designs were original, she'd not only have to pay Harmony Jewelry but also fork out a breach of contract penalty to their partner.

Nina had the original sketches, all hand-drawn 'cause she wasn't into computer software. But when she went to the office to grab them, they were gone. Clearly, there was a mole in the company.

To make things worse, Nina's assistant had just quit the day before. Nina was totally floored.

She had personally hired the young girl, drawn to her fresh-faced innocence. She saw a bit of Isabella in her and couldn't help but give her extra care and attention. Turns out, she had set herself up for trouble.

Nina sat in her chair, dazed and unable to snap out of it.

When Richard walked in and saw Nina's lost look, his frown deepened.

He strode over, gently cupped Nina's face, and turned her to face him. "Nina, look at me."

Nina had been holding back her tears, but as soon as she saw Richard, her eyes welled up.

"If you wanna cry, don't hold back," Richard said, his thumb brushing Nina's lower eyelid, his expression pained. "It's not embarrassing in front of me."

Richard took two steps forward, pulling Nina into his arms, letting her face rest against him. His fingers gently stroked her ear, comforting her in his own way.

Nina looked up from his embrace. "With you like this, I feel embarrassed to cry."

Richard looked down at her. "I've seen you in every state. What's there to be embarrassed about in front of me?"

Nina said, "I messed up such a big deal. If I just sit in the office and cry, wouldn't people sneer at me?"

Richard gave a faint smile. "I was worried you couldn't handle the hit, so I rushed over to comfort you. Looks like I was overthinking."

Nina wrapped her arms around his waist. "Not really. Richard, thanks for being here."

Right now, Nina really needed someone to lean on. With Richard around, she could finally calm down and think straight.

"Got a plan?" Richard asked.

Nina said, "The best move now is to find my old assistant. She's a key witness and might still have some of my drafts. But since she took money from Harmony Jewelry, she might not want to testify. Even if we find her, it might be a dead end."

Richard asked, "So what's the game plan?"

Nina's eyes lit up. "Some of my design ideas came from Esme. If Esme could step in..."

"That's easy. I'll talk to her," Richard said.

Nina shook her head. "I want to talk to her myself."

Just then, the assistant knocked on the door, saying there was a guest.

Surprisingly, Esme had already shown up.

The plagiarism drama with Nina and Isabella Jewelry had caused such a buzz that it was hard for Esme, a big shot in the industry, to miss.

Esme said, "I've got some documents I've put together. Take a look; they might help. Plus, I'm holding a press conference tomorrow. Nina, you need to come with me. I'll testify and clear everything up in front of the media. With these documents and my testimony, the plagiarism issue should be sorted."

Nina flipped through the documents. "These are exactly what I need! Aunt Esme, thank you so much."

Esme smiled. "These are small things. Nina, after all these years, I should be the one thanking you!"

The next day, with Esme's help, the issue was resolved perfectly.

Isabella sat in front of the TV, watching the press conference wrap up flawlessly, her tense heart finally relaxing.

She was super grateful to Esme for stepping in. Without her, Nina's problem might not have been fixed so easily.

Thinking everything was sorted, Isabella decided to throw a dinner party and invite everyone over. Of course, she couldn't do it alone since she had to take care of Sweetie and do the grocery shopping.

Sebastian had suggested hiring a nanny to help out, but Isabella always refused. Considering Sweetie was still young, and after the whole Siena incident, Isabella didn't dare to trust Sweetie to anyone else. Plus, there were always news stories about nannies mistreating kids behind their parents' backs.

Having lost Sweetie once, Isabella wasn't about to take that risk again. She'd rather handle everything herself, even if it meant extra exhaustion. With help from the Jose family and Esme now pitching in with Sweetie, the load wasn't actually that heavy.

Isabella first called the Jose family. Margaret, having just recovered from a serious illness, was eager to see Sweetie and immediately agreed. Without a moment's hesitation, she set off at once.

Isabella then called others, inviting almost everyone she could think of. She put Sweetie in the stroller and planned to hit the nearby supermarket for some fresh fruit. As soon as she stepped out, she ran into Elodie.

Elodie seemed to have just come out of Quentin's house. She was about to leave but turned and walked towards Isabella when she saw her.

Isabella instinctively stopped until Elodie reached her.

###chapter 352  Debt

Elodie shot Isabella a sharp look. "Can you stop being so clingy with my mom?"

Isabella was left speechless.

Elodie continued, "Yeah, you might be my mom's kid, but you're still a bastard. The Black Family will never accept you!"

Isabella chuckled. "I never wanted to be part of the Black Family anyway."

"Yeah, right. Like you could even get in if you tried," Elodie sneered. "Do you even know what the Black Family means in Silvercrest? Not just you, even your husband, Seb-if the Black Family wanted to crush him, it'd be a piece of cake!"

Isabella didn't think Elodie was bluffing, but hearing her talk about human life so casually made her frown.

Isabella had no clue what the Black Family was all about or what kind of world Elodie grew up in, but she knew one thing: Elodie was self-centered and had zero empathy.

People like Elodie might seem just spoiled and careless, but they could cause big trouble if not careful.

Isabella said, "We live in a society with laws. Even if the Black Family is powerful, I doubt they'd go around killing people. If they did, they wouldn't last long!"

"I've got stuff to do, so I'm out. Do whatever you want." Isabella pushed the stroller and walked past Elodie.

Elodie's voice rang out. "My mom just feels guilty and wants to make it up to you. She already has me and Lova. Lova is the apple of my parents' eyes. If Lova weren't sick, my mom wouldn't have come looking for you!"

Isabella's heart skipped a beat, and she stopped instinctively.

She turned to look at Elodie. "What did you just say?"

Elodie looked smug. "What, my mom cares about you so much but didn't tell you she has another daughter?"

Isabella's face went a bit pale. Esme had never mentioned this.

Isabella only knew about Quentin and Elodie; she had no idea Esme had another daughter, Lova Black.

Elodie said, "Looks like I was right. My mom came back to find you just to ease her guilt. Isabella, you better know your place. Don't think my mom really loves you! If she did, why didn't she come back for you all these years, only to show up when Lova is seriously ill?"

Isabella looked at Elodie, her fingers gripping the stroller tightly. "What do you mean?"

Elodie said, "I'm not afraid to tell you. About six months ago, Lova suddenly got this weird illness. We saw tons of doctors, but none could cure her. My parents had no choice but to consult a fortune teller. The fortune teller told my mom she had debts to repay in this world. She had to settle these debts to give Lova a slim chance of survival."

"That's ridiculous!" Isabella almost reflexively retorted, "If you're sick, you see a doctor. What good is a fortune teller?"

Elodie said, "Yeah, I said the same thing. Guess what? My dad slapped me! Mom protected me, saying she would repay her debt. Not long after, she and Quentin came to Lakina to find you. Guess who the debt is?"

Isabella didn't respond.

In fact, she was at a loss for words at that moment. Because similar things had happened to Isabella.

When Isabella was a kid, she was always sickly and weak, way more fragile than other kids. She'd catch a cold at the drop of a hat and be down for days.

Nina had no choice but to hike up a mountain, kneeling the whole way, to get a blessed bracelet.

Since then, Isabella never took off the bracelet, and her health started to get better.

Sometimes, these things are just hard to explain. If someone else had told her, Isabella might not have believed it, but because she had experienced the same thing, what Elodie said seemed more believable.

Isabella thought, 'Did Esme come back to me to repay a debt and save Lova?'

A chill spread through Isabella's heart, like it was freezing her from the inside out.

The sound of a car engine came from behind, and a silver-gray car pulled into the neighboring yard.

Seeing the car, Elodie immediately dropped her smile. "Isabella, think it over. I'm outta here!"

With that, she turned and walked towards the car.

Quentin got out and glanced in Isabella's direction.

Elodie blocked his view. "Quentin, why are you so late? I've been waiting forever."

Quentin ignored Elodie and looked at Isabella again.

Isabella stood still for a bit before slowly pushing the stroller out of the yard.

It wasn't until Isabella's figure disappeared that Quentin pulled his gaze away and asked Elodie, "What did you just say to Isabella?"

Elodie avoided his gaze, looking guilty. "Nothing, just chatted a bit."

"Really?" Quentin suddenly grabbed Elodie's wrist and dragged her into the house.

Quentin's strides were quick and hurried, making Elodie stumble along in a series of short runs as he pulled her. "Quentin, what are you doing? You're hurting me, Quentin!"

Once inside, Quentin let go of Elodie and slammed the door shut.

He stared coldly at Elodie. "I'll ask you one last time; what nonsense did you say to Isabella?"

Elodie knew she couldn't hide it, so she rubbed her reddened wrist and said pitifully, "I just told her about Lova!"

Quentin's face instantly darkened. "You mentioned Lova?"

"Yeah." Elodie was a bit scared, her voice weakening. "Why, can't I?"

Quentin gritted his teeth and grabbed Elodie's hair, pressing her against the cabinet.

Elodie cried out in pain, forced to look up and meet Quentin's cold eyes. She immediately felt a chill in her limbs. "Quentin, you're really hurting me this time!"

Elodie was on the verge of tears, but Quentin was still unmoved, staring coldly at her. "Elodie! Do you want to cause trouble?"

Elodie called, "Quentin."

Quentin asked, "What gives you the right to mention Lova?"

Quentin's grip tightened, and Elodie felt like her scalp was about to be torn off.

But at that moment, her fear outweighed the pain. She knew that when Quentin got serious, he was frightening. In this world, besides Lova's tears, no one's tears mattered to Quentin!

Enduring the pain and tears, Elodie quickly said, "I just couldn't stand Isabella's smug look and wanted to knock her down a peg!"

Quentin was furious. "Elodie, sometimes I really want to tear your mouth apart!"

Hearing this, Elodie shivered. She knew Quentin meant what he said.

The two most ruthless people Elodie had ever seen were Bruno and Quentin!

###chapter 353 Lova

"Quentin," Elodie sobbed, tears streaming down her face. "I swear, I didn't mean it. Please, just this once, forgive me. Lova loves me the most. If she saw you treating me like this, she'd never forgive you!"

Elodie knew exactly where to hit Quentin. Mentioning Lova was her only shot. As soon as she brought up Lova, Quentin's hard expression softened a bit. He still looked pissed, but the murderous vibe dialed down.

A few seconds later, Quentin finally let her go.

Elodie slid down the cabinet door, collapsing on the floor, her legs shaking like jelly.

Quentin stood over her, slowly rolling up his sleeves. "Spill it. What did you say to Lova?"

Elodie racked her brain, terrified of saying the wrong thing and setting him off again. "I didn't say much. Just that Mom came back to cure Lova's illness!"

Quentin's eyes narrowed. "That's all you said?!"

Elodie shrank back, quickly adding, "I told her Lova had a weird illness, and Mom and Dad saw a fortune teller who said Mom needed to clear her debts in this world to save Lova."

After that, Elodie could feel Quentin's anger ease up a bit.

Quentin pressed, "And what else?"

Elodie shook her head. "Nothing else."

Quentin stared her down, like he was trying to read her mind.

Elodie quickly assured him, "Really, that's all I said!"

Outside, thunder rumbled and the wind howled, dark clouds swirling in the sky.

"You better not have said anything else!" Quentin grabbed an umbrella, opened the door, and threw one last warning over his shoulder, "Elodie, keep your mouth shut, or even Bruno won't be able to save you!"

Elodie was so scared she clamped her hands over her mouth, eyes wide as Quentin stormed out.

"Would you like to check out, ma'am?"

The cashier's voice snapped Isabella back to reality. She hurriedly handed over the fruits in her cart, got them weighed, and paid.

As she left the supermarket, Isabella noticed the weather had turned nasty. The wind was fierce, and raindrops were starting to fall.

She stood at the entrance for a bit, and just as she was about to head to a nearby cafÃ©, a tall, imposing figure appeared in front of her. It was Quentin.

Quentin had come through the rain, his clothes a bit wet, but he was holding an umbrella.

Isabella didn't greet Quentin. She just gave him a quick glance and pushed the stroller into the cafÃ©.

Isabella ordered a coffee, and Quentin followed her in.

Quentin set his umbrella aside and brushed the water droplets off his shoulder.

A waiter approached and asked softly, "Sir, what would you like to drink?"

"An espresso, please. Thanks," Quentin said politely.

After the waiter left, Quentin finally looked at Isabella and said, "It's pouring out there, and you still came out to buy fruit yourself?"

The supermarket in the villa area offered home delivery, but Isabella usually liked to come in person, pick out what she wanted, and then have it delivered.

"It wasn't raining when I came," Isabella replied.

The atmosphere grew a bit tense.

The coffee was quickly brought over. Isabella noticed that what she had ordered was similar to what Quentin had in his cup.

"You like espresso too?" Quentin seemed a bit surprised. "I thought most girls preferred sweeter stuff. Espresso without sugar or milk is pretty bitter."

"I don't usually drink coffee," Isabella said, "When I do, I add sugar."

Today, though, she hadn't added any. She wasn't in the mood for sweetness and had asked the waiter for the bitterest coffee they had.

Isabella held the spoon, gently stirring the liquid in her cup. Once it was well-mixed, she took a small sip.

The warm liquid hit her tongue, and the bitter taste spread immediately, making her hold her breath and furrow her brows.

Isabella thought, 'Man, this is really bitter.'

Quentin saw this and smiled lightly. He took a couple of sips of his own coffee.

Isabella swallowed the coffee. "Don't you find it bitter?"

Quentin replied, "A bit."

Isabella thought, 'Just a bit?'

She put down her cup and eventually asked the waiter for some sugar cubes.

As she added the sugar, Quentin smiled. "Why seven cubes?"

"Just a habit," Isabella said, "Seven's supposed to be a lucky number."

After saying this, she noticed Quentin pause. When he looked at her again, his eyes seemed to have a thin layer of mist over them.

Isabella couldn't read his expression and asked, "What's wrong?"

Quentin smiled. "Lova said the same thing."

Isabella's fingers froze. This was the second time today she had heard that name.

Quentin said, "I was planning to tell you later, because you and Mom just reunited. I didn't want to burden you with bad news. But since Elodie already spilled the beans, I might as well talk to you now."

Quentin took out his phone, found a photo in his album, and handed it to Isabella.

Isabella looked down, and a bright, youthful smile filled the screen.

She was a young, innocent girl, her hair styled beautifully with colorful flowers woven into the parting. Clad in a white dress that fluttered in the wind, her smile radiated warmth surpassing even the sunlight, and her eyes sparkled with vibrant life.

Lova was beautiful; she was more beautiful than Elodie.

Lova's features resembled Esme's, with expressive eyes that made the world seem less beautiful in comparison.

"This is Lova, Elodie's sister and the eldest daughter of the Black Family. She's only a year younger than you."

Isabella's eyelashes trembled. Lova was a year younger than her. That meant Esme had left her and gone to Bruno, giving birth to Lova the following year. And Elodie was only three years younger than Isabella. So, Esme had given birth to Elodie two years after Lova. No wonder Esme had never come back for her all these years. Back then, it's likely that in the warm company of Lova and Elodie, Esme had long forgotten about her.

Quentin swiped left, and another photo appeared before Isabella's eyes.

The background was a high-end hospital room, with the camera focused on a white hospital bed. A person lay upon the bed, long, yellowed hair cascading down, her emaciated frame still, eyes half-open yet devoid of life. The bed was surrounded by various medical instruments, with many tubes connected to the person.

The person looked like a leaf hanging on a tree in the autumn wind, ready to fall at any moment.

Despite this, Isabella could vaguely recognize from the features that it was Lova.

But unlike the previous photo full of life, this one showed Lova hanging on by a thread.

The stark contrast between the two photos shocked Isabella. "What's wrong with her?"

###chapter 354 Not Waiting for Him Anymore

"A rare disease," Quentin said, grabbing the phone and gently swiping the screen where Lova's pic was, his eyes all soft and tender. "We've hit up so many doctors, tried a ton of meds, even set up a special studio for her. But nothing's really worked, and we still don't know what's wrong."

Isabella could tell Quentin's feelings for Lova were way more than just brotherly love. His look was more like he was head over heels, maybe even a bit romantic.

Isabella didn't wanna dig too deep and just asked, "What happened?"

Quentin shook his head, looking all helpless.

Thinking about Lova's photo, Isabella felt a pang of pity. "How much longer does she have?"

Quentin said, "She's barely hanging on; we have no clue when she'll go. We've tried everything, even turned to superstition." He looked up at Isabella, his eyes soft and sincere. "Isabella, this is kinda unfair to you. I shouldn't be talking to you about this. But I've seen how you've been with Mom, and it's really helped her, which makes me happy. Anyway, we'll stay no more than three days before heading back. I just don't want Mom to have any regrets in her last moments."

When they stepped outside, the rain had stopped, but the sky was still gloomy, with light gray clouds floating around, making everyone feel down.

Quentin and Isabella walked back to the villa together. The Jose family was already there, and Margaret came over to take Sweetie. Knowing Isabella had to prep dinner that night, Margaret brought a few servants and chefs from home to help out. As soon as the door opened, everyone got busy.

Standing in the yard, Isabella said to Quentin, "Come over for dinner tonight; everyone's gonna be here."

Quentin nodded, giving a faint smile. "Okay."

Isabella nodded back and was about to head inside when Quentin suddenly reached out, his fingertips brushing her hair as he picked off a fallen leaf.

Seeing the leaf, Isabella was momentarily dazed, like she saw Lova lying in the hospital bed again.

When Isabella snapped back, she found Quentin staring at her, his gaze different from usual. Isabella felt a slight chill in her heart, mixed with some confusion. In that brief moment, her mind went blank. If it had lasted a bit longer, she might've forgotten what just happened.

Feeling uneasy, Isabella took two steps back, putting some space between her and Quentin.

Quentin smiled slightly. "See you later."

Isabella nodded. "Okay."

Margaret's voice called out from inside the house, and Isabella hurried back in.

As she entered, Isabella instinctively glanced back and saw Quentin putting the fallen leaf into his pocket.

With the Jose family's servants and chefs handling dinner, Isabella felt more relaxed.

Margaret took care of Sweetie the whole time, while Miley and Kelsey pulled Isabella into a card game.

The three of them played chess, and soon Kelsey's face was covered with sticky notes.

Jack rolled in with Sebastian. As soon as they stepped inside, they heard Kelsey wailing, "Help! Why do I keep losing?"

Seeing Jack, Kelsey called out for him to save her.

Isabella and Miley both chimed in, "No cheating! Kelsey, you gotta play your own cards."

Then Isabella felt a sudden warmth on her shoulder. Sebastian had taken off his suit jacket, bent slightly, and placed his hands between her and the table, his head almost resting on her shoulder.

Isabella got momentarily distracted, and a few cards slipped from her hand onto the table.

Kelsey laughed. "Bella, you just said no cheating!"

Miley laughed along. "No, this is a public display of affection; you and I are just the victims."

"Says who?" Kelsey grabbed Jack's hand. "I have someone too."

Miley was speechless. She smiled helplessly. "Alright, I'm the only one suffering."

Margaret, feeling sorry for her, quickly went to call Zaire.

"Dinner?" Zaire said on the phone. "I'm so busy; I don't have time for dinner, Mom."

Margaret said, "I don't care; you come back right now! Everyone else is paired up; do you want Miley to be alone?"

Zaire was silent for a couple of seconds, then decisively said, "I'm not coming back. I don't have time. I'm busy."

At that moment, another voice came through the receiver. "Zaire, whose call is it?"

Margaret's sharp ears immediately recognized the voice and frowned, questioning Zaire, "Are you with Susan?"

Zaire dodged the question. "Mom, I have things to do; I gotta go. Enjoy yourself."

With that, Zaire didn't give Margaret a chance to ask more and hung up.

Margaret could only hold the phone, glaring.

Margaret composed herself and turned around, planning to support Miley herself. But as she turned, she found Miley standing quietly behind her.

Margaret's expression changed. "Miley, when did you get here?"

"Just now." Miley smiled, her face radiant even with light makeup.

Margaret admired Miley's composed and introspective nature, coupled with her radiant and striking appearance. It was a pity that Zaire was still hung up on Susan.

Margaret felt a bit distressed. "Miley, be honest with me, have you and Zaire broken up?"

Miley smiled gracefully. "No, we haven't."

Margaret breathed a sigh of relief. "That's good; that's good."

Halfway through, Miley added, "Zaire and I were never really together."

Margaret said, "Miley, Zaire is just confused. He's very persistent about his feelings. As his mother, I know him best. Once he realizes it, he'll definitely treat you well."

Miley shook her head. "Sorry, Margaret, but I can't wait for him."

Margaret's heart sank, and she quickly asked, "Why not?"

Miley said, "My family has arranged a blind date for me. After tonight's dinner, I have to go back home."

"What?" Margaret couldn't smile anymore. She held Miley's hand, wanting to persuade her. But she knew the problem wasn't with Miley; it was with Zaire. Miley could not indefinitely wait for Zaire.

Miley sensed Margaret's dilemma and squeezed her hand. "Margaret, I really like you and the atmosphere of your family. I've tried my best, but maybe Zaire and I just aren't meant to be. We're probably better off apart. Don't worry; we can still keep in touch like always."

###chapter 355 Proposal

Esme swung by to change her clothes and showed up with Quentin in tow.

Elodie bailed 'cause she couldn't stand Isabella.

Nina and Richard were the last ones to roll in, and they dragged Michael along. Isabella figured one more wouldn't hurt, so she told Michael to stick around for dinner. He was down for it.

Dinner was chill, though Isabella seemed a bit spaced out now and then.

Mid-meal, Sebastian dipped out for a bit.

Outta nowhere, the lights went out with a whoosh.

The place went from buzzing to dead silent in a heartbeat.

Isabella, being the host and all, was about to check the switch, but just as she got up, the lights flickered back on.

The small lamps hidden in the furniture cast a soft glow. Sebastian walked in, holding flowers and a ring, making his way to Isabella.

Isabella's jaw dropped, her heart racing, already guessing what was coming.

Someone started playing music, and everyone watched, silently rooting for them.

Sebastian got down on one knee in front of Isabella, looking all serious. "Bella."

Isabella stared at him, tears welling up. She was too choked up to speak.

Sebastian handed her the flowers and the ring, gently holding her hand. "Bella, sorry for making you wait so long. Will you spend the rest of your life with me? Marry me, be my wife, and I'll always be there for you and Sweetie."

His voice was soft and slow, each word carefully chosen. After he finished, he kissed the back of her hand.

Isabella blinked, feeling her chest swell with emotion.

She nodded, her voice a bit muffled. "I do."

Kelsey was bawling. Miley looked down, tears in her eyes too.

Nina and Esme were the most moved. Margaret couldn't hold back either, quietly dabbing her tears with a tissue.

Sebastian and Isabella had been through a lot together. The whole Jose family saw it all, and Margaret, being the emotional one, found the scene touching, even though Sebastian and Isabella already had kids.

Even Esme, usually the rational one, was moved.

Quentin, sitting next to Esme, had a gentle smile, but if you looked closely, his eyes were cold.

Richard suddenly turned to look at him. Quentin didn't meet his gaze, just downed his wine in one gulp.

Richard slowly looked away, a sharp glint in his eyes.

The proposal was formal, and the wedding plans were already in motion.

In the coming days, Isabella had to pick out a wedding dress, and of course, Nina had to be there.

Miley had gone home for a blind date, and Kelsey was always with Jack, so Isabella asked Esme to join her.

At the bridal shop, Esme snapped a ton of photos. In the end, Isabella picked a simple and elegant dress.

Customizing the dress would take time; Sebastian and Isabella's wedding was set for a month later.

When Isabella changed back into her clothes and came out, she saw Esme on the phone, looking all serious and grim.

By the time Isabella got closer, Esme had already hung up and turned back with a smile. "Bella."

The two plopped down on the sofa. Isabella hesitated before speaking, "I heard from Quentin that you're leaving the day after tomorrow?"

"Yeah." Esme nodded, looking a bit bummed. "But don't worry, I'll be back before your wedding."

Isabella looked at her. "Okay."

Esme's phone rang again. She glanced at it and patted Isabella's hand. "I need to take this call."

As Esme got up, Isabella also stood up and called out, "Mom."

Hearing that, Esme's body stiffened. She slowly turned around, her face already covered in tears.

Isabella walked up and hugged her. "Mom, I forgive you. No matter what, you're still my mother."

Esme couldn't hold back and started crying.

Isabella said, "Quentin told me everything about Lova. I'm willing to forgive you. I hope you and Lova have some good luck, and I hope she gets better soon."

Esme tightly held her hand, her eyes filled with tears. "Thank you, Bella. Thank you so much. You must be happy, you must!"

Isabella nodded. "Okay."

"What did you say?" Quentin stood up abruptly, his face coldly staring at Esme.

Esme sat on the sofa. "I've made up my mind. Bella is also my daughter, and I don't want to trade her for Lova."

Quentin sneered. "You're giving up on Lova?"

"Quentin!" Esme said sternly, "Lova's illness is incurable. Without those machines, she'd be gone long ago. Look at Lova now, clinging to life in such a state, like a living dead. Do you think this is fair to her? If she woke up and saw herself like this, could she handle it?"

Esme thought, 'My Lova had once been such a sunny, lively girl.'

Esme closed her eyes, feeling both despair and determination. "Quentin, let Lova go!"

"I won't let her go!" Quentin said coldly, "Even if the whole world gives up on her, I won't. Mom, you really disappoint me!"

Esme sighed. "I've already owed Bella too much. Seeing her so happy now, I can't do anything to hurt her anymore."

Quentin stared at her but said nothing more.

Late at night, Isabella heard a cat meowing. She suddenly opened her eyes and turned her head to see a cat crouching on the balcony. It was Cheese.

Cheese's eyes glowed green in the dark, looking super creepy.

Isabella got goosebumps but still walked over and reached out to shoo it away.

The cat suddenly leaped from the windowsill and pounced on Isabella.

Isabella screamed and instinctively backed away, but she was suddenly pulled into a warm embrace.

She turned around and saw Sebastian, her heart instantly calming.

Sebastian pulled Isabella into his arms with one hand, while the other hand grabbed a coat and swatted the cat out of the window.

The cat let out a strange cry and fell straight from the second floor.

Isabella, still shaken, broke out in a cold sweat. She turned and burrowed into Sebastian's arms. "The second-floor windowsill is so high-how did the cat manage to climb up there?"

Sebastian stroked her back, his voice steady. "It probably climbed up the pipe." He slightly loosened his hold on Isabella. "I'll go check."

Isabella grabbed him. "Don't go." She was really scared.

###chapter 356 This Time You Really Chose Wrong

Isabella was practically glued to Sebastian's arm, like she was afraid to let go.

Sebastian chuckled, giving her hand a playful pat. "It's just a cat, Bella. No need to freak out."

But Isabella was still on edge. After a moment, she blurted out, "I'll go with you."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Aren't you scared?"

She swallowed hard, pressing herself even closer to him. "Not when you're here."

"Alright then." Sebastian squeezed her hand. "Stick close. I'll handle whatever comes our way."

They made their way to the window, hand in hand. Sebastian leaned on the windowsill, peering out, while Isabella hovered behind him. The wind whipped through the open window, stinging their faces.

"Do you see it?" Isabella asked, her voice shaky.

"Yeah," Sebastian said, turning back and shutting the window. "It's gone."

They headed back to the bed, but Isabella was still a bit rattled.

Sebastian flicked on the bedside lamp, and the warm light started to calm her down. He rubbed her fingers, noticing the sweat on her forehead. "Bella, you really that scared of a cat?"

Isabella glanced at the window, then snuggled closer to Sebastian, like he was her only safe spot. "I don't know why, but that cat gave me the creeps. Just like..."

Sebastian leaned in. "Like what?"

"Just like Quentin." Isabella's eyes widened as she said it. She'd always thought of Quentin as this gentle, refined guy. When did that change? She wasn't even sure herself.

Sebastian stared at her for a moment, then pulled her into a hug. "Quentin's not a good guy, Bella. If he freaks you out, steer clear of him. I don't want you getting too close."

His words, tinged with jealousy, eased the tension in Isabella's heart. She nodded. "I know."

The next day, Isabella and the gang headed to the airport to see Miley off.

Everyone knew about Miley and Zaire. It was a bummer, but there was nothing they could do.

As they said their goodbyes, Margaret seemed distracted, her eyes constantly darting to the entrance.

"Margaret," Miley said, walking over and opening her arms for a hug.

Margaret's tears started to fall as they embraced. "Miley, do you really have to go?"

Miley's eyes were misty too, but she kept her smile, trying to comfort Margaret. "Margaret, we'll meet again. This goodbye is just for now."

Margaret sighed. "I know. I can't make you stay. But wait a bit longer. I called Zaire. He's on his way."

Margaret thought, 'Only Zaire can make Miley stay now.'

Miley's eyes flickered, but she didn't object. She was clearly moved.

With time to kill before the flight, they went to a coffee shop nearby, sipping tea and chatting.

As the minutes ticked by, Margaret got more and more antsy.

Miley's alarm went off. She turned it off and smiled. "Time's almost up. Looks like this goodbye is happening."

"Stay a bit longer," Margaret pleaded, giving Kelsey a meaningful look.

Kelsey got the hint and excused herself to the bathroom to call Zaire.

The phone rang forever before he finally picked up.

Kelsey was practically shouting into the phone, "Zaire, where the hell are you? We've tried everything to get Miley to stay, but if you don't show up soon, she's outta here for good!"

There was a pause, then a woman's voice came on. "Kelsey, sorry, Zaire can't make it."

Kelsey was taken aback. "Susan? Is Zaire with you?"

Susan sighed. "Yeah, I'm sick, and Zaire's here taking care of me. I didn't know Miley was leaving today. Should I tell him to come over now? Will he make it?"

Kelsey gritted her teeth. "Put Zaire on the phone."

Susan replied, "He's out getting my meds. I'll let him know when he gets back, okay?"

Kelsey couldn't take it anymore and hung up. When she turned around, there was Miley.

Kelsey tried to mask her expression. "Miley."

Miley gave a faint smile. "I didn't mean to eavesdrop; I just needed the bathroom."

Kelsey felt a pang of guilt. What Zaire was doing was seriously messed up.

The plane eventually took off.

At the hospital, Zaire came back with the medicine and saw his phone in Susan's hand. "Why do you have my phone?"

Susan handed it over. "You left it."

Zaire checked the call log, seeing Kelsey's call. Susan's voice broke the silence. "Kelsey called. She said you should go to the airport."

Zaire frowned but stayed quiet.

Susan watched him, biting her lip. "Zaire, are you and Miley over?"

Zaire pocketed his phone, his face unreadable. "We were never a thing, so there's nothing to get over."

He moved behind Susan and pushed her wheelchair towards the elevator. "I'll find someone to take care of you, Susan. Don't do something as dumb as falling down the stairs again!"

"Alright," Susan replied softly, lowering her eyes, a slight smile playing on her lips.

Zaire got home super late. As soon as he walked into the living room, he felt the tension. His family was all there, staring at him like he was on trial. Their eyes followed his every move.

"What's going on?" Zaire asked, trying to keep it light.

Margaret didn't waste a second, grabbing a throw pillow and chucking it at him.

Zaire blocked it with his arm, and it fell to the floor.

"So, you finally decided to come back. Alone, huh? Where's Susan?" Margaret asked, barely holding back her anger.

Zaire picked up the pillow, dusted it off, and tossed it back on the sofa. Leaning back, he said, "I took her home."

The room went dead silent for a few minutes.

Then Margaret snorted, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "How gentlemanly of you!"

She shot Zaire a scornful look and stormed upstairs.

Steven stood up, gave Zaire a once-over, and said, "Gentlemanly!" before leaving too.

Zaire was left speechless. He turned around to meet Kelsey's furious gaze.

Kelsey said, "Zaire, you really screwed up this time. Don't come crying to us when you realize what you've lost." With that, she walked out too.

The once lively living room was now empty, leaving Zaire alone.

Just then, his phone rang. Seeing Susan's name on the screen, Zaire didn't feel any joy. But he still answered it and put the phone to his ear.

###chapter 357 Deleted

"Yo, Zaire," Susan's voice came through the phone, sounding a bit shy. "How'd you know I got my period?"

Zaire kicked back on the couch and replied casually, "You had a stain on your pants."

Susan felt a bit embarrassed and fished around in a plastic bag for a pad. "Thanks. You're always so thoughtful."

Zaire didn't say anything.

Susan clearly didn't want to hang up yet and started reminiscing. "I still remember the first time I got my period. I was clueless, jumping around the playground like an idiot. You showed up outta nowhere and tied your white jacket around my waist."

"It's getting late. You should get some rest," Zaire cut her off in a calm voice.

Susan paused for a moment and said, "Alright then. You should rest too. Sorry for bothering you today."

"No trouble," Zaire muttered through clenched teeth before ending the call.

Zaire got up, went to the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge, and chugged it. Even though he felt better, he didn't look happy.

He pulled out his phone and pulled up Miley's Facebook. Their chat history was still stuck on last month.

That was the last time Zaire sent money to Miley. She accepted it and sent a text: [Thanks, Mr. Jose.]

On a whim, Zaire clicked on Miley's status.

Zaire thought, 'I can't see anything. Did Miley block me? I could see it before!'

Zaire exited the status and went back to the chat. After thinking for a moment, he transferred five thousand dollars.

As soon as the message was sent, a gray checkmark appeared.

Zaire was speechless and thought, 'Alright, alright, did Miley delete me?'

Zaire didn't add her back. After exiting the chat, he felt a bit irritated.

The mall.

Since Esme was heading back to Silvercrest tomorrow, Isabella and Nina decided to buy her some gifts.

Isabella and Nina wandered around the mall. Isabella bought a scarf, and Nina got a bottle of perfume.

Considering Esme didn't lack jewelry or anything, the most important thing about a gift was the thought behind it. So Isabella and Nina spent the afternoon making two cups by hand.

By the time Isabella and Nina got home with the gifts, it was already dark.

When Esme got the gifts, she was super happy and insisted that Isabella and Nina stay for a chat.

Nina had just sat down when her phone rang; it was something from work.

Nina answered the call and then stood up. She said, "Sorry, Aunt Esme, there's something at work I need to handle. I'll definitely see you off at the airport tomorrow."

Knowing Nina was busy, Esme didn't insist and saw her to the door.

Isabella went to the bathroom, and when she opened the door to come out, a dark shadow darted past her.

She was startled. Even though it moved quickly, Isabella still recognized it as the cat named Cheese.

Lately, Isabella often saw it wandering around. Sometimes it would even cry under the windowsill in the middle of the night, like a ghost.

Isabella wasn't afraid of cats, but the memory of Cheese pouncing on her that night still lingered, so she was pretty wary of Cheese now.

However, Cheese seemed to be just passing by, and it quickly disappeared around the corner.

Isabella spun around and walked the other way. Just as she was about to reach the end of the hallway, a figure popped up, and she almost ran into it.

"Mr. Black?" Isabella called out.

Quentin looked at her. "What's up? Why are you in such a rush?"

"Nothing." Isabella patted her chest and was about to leave.

Quentin called out, "Isabella, give Sebastian a call."

Isabella paused. "What do you mean?"

Quentin didn't answer, just stared at her quietly.

His gaze made Isabella uncomfortable.

Esme's voice came from the living room. "Bella?"

Isabella quickly walked over. She stayed for about ten more minutes before saying goodbye and leaving.

The yard was empty; Sebastian hadn't come back yet. Worried, she went inside and called Sebastian.

The phone rang for ages before someone finally picked up.

But it was Jack. "Isabella, do you need something?"

Isabella was taken aback.

Since Charles died, her life with Sebastian had been pretty stable. Usually, when she called, Sebastian would answer.

Isabella remembered Quentin's look, and her heart tightened. "Where's Sebastian?"

Jack said, "Mr. Landon is in a meeting."

Isabella checked the time.

After the Landon Group crisis, Sebastian had been super strict about the company's schedule. At this time, the Landon Group should be having dinner and chilling, not in a meeting.

Realizing the inconsistency, Jack added, "A client showed up unexpectedly, and Mr. Landon is entertaining them. Isabella, is it urgent? Should I notify Mr. Landon?"

Isabella said, "No need. It's nothing urgent. Let him be."

Jack said, "Alright."

After hanging up, Jack, still uneasy, called Laura.

Laura answered, "Mr. Brown?"

Jack said, "Laura, if Isabella calls you asking about Mr. Landon, do you know what to say?"

Laura hesitated. "I'll just say Mr. Landon is sick, and an ambulance came this afternoon to take him to the hospital. Wait, shouldn't Isabella know if Mr. Landon is sick?"

"Don't say that," Jack replied, "Isabella doesn't know. Mr. Landon didn't want her to know. If she calls, just say Mr. Landon is in the meeting room with an important client. Got it?"

Laura felt conflicted. "But Isabella is my friend. I can't lie to a friend. And why wouldn't Mr. Landon tell Isabella about something as serious as being sick? Aren't couples supposed to face things together?"

Jack said, "This is Mr. Landon's decision. I can't change it. I've delivered the message. How you handle it is up to you."

As Jack had anticipated, no sooner had he finished speaking with Laura than Isabella called her, asking about Sebastian.

With Jack's instructions in mind, Laura didn't dare to say anything else and repeated what he had told her.

Isabella sighed in relief. "As long as he's okay."

Laura felt a bit guilty. "But Mr. Landon has been very busy lately. Isabella, if you have time, you should take care of his health. He seems a bit worn out these days."

Isabella said, "Got it. Thanks, Laura."

Laura replied, "You're welcome."

Meanwhile, in a sealed treatment room, Sebastian's eyes shot open and he bolted upright halfway through the session.

As before, Sebastian's hands were clenched into fists, and veins bulged on his forehead. The mirror on the opposite wall showed just how fierce he looked.

###chapter 358 Kidnapping the Boss

Marvin thought to himself, 'Failed again!' He and another doc shared a look. One got up and headed towards Sebastian, while the other yanked the curtains open to let some light in.

"Mr. Landon." As Marvin got closer, he felt something was off. Next thing he knew, Sebastian jumped up from his chair, knuckles cracking, and clocked Marvin right in the face.

Marvin didn't even have time to blink; the punch landed square on his nose.

He hit the ground, nosebleed splattering all over the white carpet.

"Dr. Finn!" the other doc shouted and quickly called Jack in. Together, they managed to pin Sebastian down.

"Mr. Landon, Mr. Landon, snap out of it!" Jack barked.

But Sebastian was too far gone to hear Jack. He was like a wild animal, eyes bloodshot, thrashing around even while being held down.

Marvin, clutching his nose, staggered to his feet, blood streaming through his fingers. He shot a look at Sebastian, grabbed a sedative from the table, and jabbed it into Sebastian's arm.

Sebastian's body went rigid, muscles tensing up like a drawn bow, hard as a rock.

A few seconds later, Sebastian's eyes rolled back, and he passed out.

Marvin let out a sigh of relief. "Move him to the recliner first."

Jack and the other doc did as told, moving Sebastian to the recliner. Marvin tossed over a rope.

Jack was taken aback. "What for?"

Marvin said, "Tie him up."

Jack was shocked. "Are you nuts? This is Mr. Landon!"

Jack thought, 'We're all employees; who dares to tie up Sebastian?'

Marvin, still wiping his nosebleed with tissues, explained, "The treatment's just started, and he's still in the early stages. Even though I gave him a sedative, there's no guarantee his hysteria will be gone when he wakes up. To keep him from hurting others or himself, it's safer to tie him up."

Marvin's logic made sense.

Hurting others could be managed, but if Sebastian, in a daze, jumped out of here, it would be a big deal.

Jack hesitated for a moment but eventually went along and tied Sebastian up securely.

When Jack finished and turned around, he saw Marvin's nosebleed was still going strong, and the trash can was almost overflowing with bloody tissues. It looked pretty bad.

Jack walked over and asked, "You okay?"

Marvin glared at him. "What do you think? Mr. Landon's punch nearly knocked me into next week!"

Jack said, "You can't blame Mr. Landon. Why were you hanging around in front of him? You know he doesn't recognize anyone when he's having an episode!"

Marvin laughed angrily. "Alright, Jack, next time Mr. Landon has an episode, you stand in front of him!"

Jack rolled his eyes. Seeing Marvin still wiping his nosebleed and wincing in pain, Jack said, "I think your nose might be busted. You should see a doc quick, or you might end up with a crooked nose and never find a wife."

"See a doc? I am a doc!" Marvin was super annoyed.

At that moment, the other doc chimed in, "Professor, you should listen to Mr. Brown and get it checked. Mr. Landon's punch wasn't light; your nasal bone might be fractured."

Hearing this, Marvin went quiet.

Marvin knew his stuff, and he could tell his nose was definitely busted. Sebastian's punch was no joke, and it landed right on target.

"Professor, you should go get that checked out," Bradley said. "I'll keep an eye on Mr. Landon. The sedative I gave him will keep him out for a while. If anything happens, I'll call you."

Bradley Vaughn was Marvin's student, a real whiz kid in medicine. He'd been shadowing Marvin for over a year, and Marvin trusted him with a lot of lab work.

Bradley was majoring in psychology, and Sebastian's case was a rare one. Bradley had worked his butt off to get involved.

Marvin liked giving Bradley chances to learn, so he often let him be part of Sebastian's treatment, taking notes and even handling some of the procedures. With Bradley around, Marvin felt okay leaving Sebastian in his care.

Marvin turned to Jack, clearly annoyed. "Jack, you're coming with me!"

Jack rolled his eyes. "What are you, a kid? Need me to hold your hand to see a doc?"

"I'm a patient!" Marvin snapped. "You coming or not?"

Seeing Marvin's busted nose, Jack was worried about Sebastian, so he asked Bradley, "You good to handle this alone?"

Bradley nodded confidently. "Yeah, I got this. Besides, you're just going to the next building. It'll take like ten minutes. If anything happens, I'll call you right away."

Jack nodded. "Alright. Take care of Mr. Landon."

Bradley said, "Don't worry. I'll be right here."

"Let's go," Jack said to Marvin.

If it weren't for Marvin's injury, Jack wouldn't have agreed to go with him.

Marvin covered his nose with one hand and raised the other. "Come on, help me out."

Jack kicked him lightly. "Move it."

Marvin yelped, "Is this how you treat a patient? Got any sympathy?"

Jack said calmly, "If you don't move, I'll kick you again."

Marvin quickly walked ahead, grumbling, "You're so heartless. How will you ever find a wife?"

Jack chuckled. "Sorry, I already got a girlfriend."

Marvin blinked. "No way! I don't believe it! How do you have a girlfriend when I, so awesome, don't?"

To shut Marvin up, Jack pulled out his phone, showed a pic of him and Kelsey, and waved it in front of Marvin.

Marvin, fuming, started bleeding from his nose even more.

Watching Marvin and Jack get in the elevator, Bradley closed the door and went back to Sebastian.

Bradley raised his hand and gently nudged Sebastian, calling softly, "Mr. Landon, Mr. Landon?"

"Sebastian, Sebastian." A voice echoed from somewhere far away. Sebastian struggled to open his eyes.

The room was dim, and everything was quiet.

Sebastian's head pounded. He tried to move but realized he was tied up.

"Sebastian." A soft voice came from above.

Sebastian looked up, leaning back in the chair, and saw a woman standing behind the recliner. His pupils shrank, and he croaked out, "Mom?"

###chapter 359 Hysteria

"Sebastian." Anna turned around from behind the recliner and plopped down next to him.

Sebastian's eyes were glued to her, wide open, barely blinking.

The Anna in front of him was just like he remembered. Always in that pure white dress, with that delicate, beautiful face. Her eyes always had that deep love for him, and she always had a white gardenia tucked behind her ear.

Sebastian's world was spinning, but Anna was getting clearer.

"Mom!" Sebastian growled, his whole body straining, muscles tight, as the ropes cut into his flesh, leaving bloody marks.

Sebastian sat up straight in his chair, tears in his eyes, voice shaking. "Am I dreaming? Mom, did you finally come to see me?"

Anna reached out and gently touched his cheek, her voice soft. "Sebastian, it's been so long. You've grown up."

Tears rolled down Sebastian's cheeks. He closed his eyes, tilting his head slightly, feeling his mom's touch. The bloody scar in his heart seemed to be slowly healing.

"Mom, I missed you so much," Sebastian said.

Right now, Sebastian was like a helpless, pitiful kid, all his usual toughness and ruthlessness gone. Stripped of his tough exterior, Sebastian was heartbroken.

"I missed you too." Anna stood up, reached out, and hugged Sebastian. "Sebastian, I'll stay with you from now on. You don't have to be afraid anymore."

Sebastian clung tightly to Anna, feeling his mom's warmth. "Mom, don't leave. Don't leave me alone."

"I'm not leaving. Sebastian, I won't leave anymore," Anna said.

Sebastian nodded. "Okay."

Under Anna's soothing, Sebastian's emotions calmed down a lot.

After a few minutes, his breathing became even, his tightly furrowed brows relaxed, and he fell asleep in a comfortable and relaxed state.

Bradley, who had been sitting in the corner taking notes, closed his notebook and walked over.

Bradley carefully checked Sebastian's expression and said, "Guess I'm right."

After speaking, Bradley's gaze fell upon Siena, who was holding Sebastian. A hint of madness flashed in his eyes. "You're definitely the one I've been looking for!"

Siena looked up. "Dr. Vaughn, thank you for giving me this chance. Without your help, I wouldn't have been able to see him, let alone get this close to him."

Bradley raised his hand to interrupt her. "No need to thank me. We're just fulfilling each other's needs, no need for gratitude. Mr. Landon's hysteria is extremely rare. If I can cure him, it will be a big deal in medicine."

Siena looked at him, sensing a kind of madness in Bradley's eyes that she couldn't understand.

But it didn't matter. Bradley had his goals, and she had hers. As Bradley said, they were just fulfilling each other's needs, no need for thanks.

Bradley glanced at his watch and frowned slightly. "Time's up. You can leave now."

"So soon?" Siena was reluctant, looking down at Sebastian.

Sebastian was quietly leaning in her arms. At this moment, Siena truly felt that he belonged to her, only to her!

Siena loved the feeling of Sebastian relying on her and loved the way he looked at her, with his eyes full of her.

"Dr. Vaughn, can I stay a little longer? Just a little while," Siena pleaded.

Bradley frowned. "Do I need to call Mr. Black and have him talk to you personally?"

At the mention of Quentin, Siena shivered and quickly said, "No need. I'll go. I'll go."

With a heavy heart, Siena reluctantly laid Sebastian back in the recliner. She bent down and placed a gentle kiss on his forehead before letting go.

Bradley watched from the side, feeling a headache coming on. "This is just the beginning. As long as you cooperate with me, I'll make sure you get more chances to be with him."

Siena's eyes lit up with hope. "Don't worry, Dr. Vaughn. I'll cooperate with you."

"Alright. Now hurry up and leave." Bradley walked over and opened the door for her.

Siena took one last look at Sebastian before turning to leave.

Once outside, she put on a mask and a baseball cap, covering her face completely, and pressed the elevator button.

When the elevator arrived and the doors opened, Jack and Marvin were inside, mid-conversation. Marvin was mercilessly teasing Jack, who gave him a kick in return. As soon as the doors opened, they straightened up and walked out.

Siena, afraid of being recognized, lowered her head and turned slightly to the side.

After they passed, she entered the elevator.

Jack walked a few steps forward, then suddenly turned back, only to see the elevator doors closing and going down. Watching the numbers change on the panel, he frowned.

"Come on! What are you looking at?" Marvin took the opportunity to kick him from behind.

Marvin's kick caught Jack off guard, causing him to stumble and leaving a big footprint on his dress pants. He gritted his teeth and turned back, but Marvin had already run off.

Jack and Marvin returned to the room, where Bradley was drinking water.

Seeing them return, Bradley put down his cup and walked over. "Professor, is your nose okay?"

Marvin's nose had been treated, medicated, and bandaged. The bleeding had stopped, but Marvin was still shaken. "My nose is almost broken!"

Bradley sighed in relief. "Glad you're okay."

While Bradley and Marvin were talking, Jack walked over to the recliner to check on Sebastian.

Jack turned back and asked Bradley, "Has Mr. Landon not woken up at all?"

"He woke up once," Bradley said, "I hypnotized him, and he fell asleep again."

Bradley said it lightly, but Marvin and Jack both looked over.

Marvin was the most surprised. "You successfully hypnotized Mr. Landon?"

"Yes." Bradley nodded, his expression calm.

Marvin's eyes widened. "Impressive, you did something I couldn't. I really chose the right student!"

Jack gave Bradley a deep look and asked, "Dr. Vaughn, how did you do it?"

Bradley said, "I just followed the professor's instructions. Maybe I got lucky this time. It might not work again."

A hint of doubt flashed in Jack's eyes. Just as he was about to ask something, Sebastian woke up.

Sebastian opened his eyes, staring blankly at the ceiling. Although he had just woken up, his expression was filled with exhaustion.

Jack said, "Mr. Landon, you're awake?"

Sebastian glanced at Jack and said, "Untie me!"

"Okay." Seeing that Sebastian's emotions had stabilized, Jack quickly untied the ropes and threw them aside without hesitation.

Sebastian sat up, his wrists bearing conspicuous marks from prolonged binding.

Gently brushing over them, he frowned and asked, "Who tied me up?"

Jack pointed behind him without hesitation and said, "Dr. Finn!"

###chapter 360 Where Did You Go?

Marvin's eyes went wide, totally caught off guard.

Marvin thought, 'How did I never notice how Jack could leave folks speechless?'

Sebastian leaned in, elbows on his knees, rubbing his temples.

Seeing this, Bradley quickly asked, "Mr. Landon, how you feeling now?"

Sebastian stopped, looked up, and said, "Way better than before."

Bradley looked relieved. "Yeah, 'cause you nailed that hypnosis session. It went super smooth."

"You mean that hypnosis thing actually worked?" Sebastian thought back to his dream.

In the dream, he saw the person he missed like crazy, and all those bottled-up feelings finally got some air.

"Did you do it?" Sebastian gave Bradley another look.

Bradley had that honest vibe, always in a white coat, holding a medical record or a notebook. His black-framed glasses made him look kinda scholarly.

Sebastian only knew Bradley was Marvin's student and had joined the recent sessions. He didn't even know Bradley's full name, nor had he ever asked. But now, Sebastian had a newfound respect for Bradley.

Bradley didn't answer right away but glanced at Marvin.

After all, Marvin was his mentor, and Sebastian was Marvin's boss. Even if Bradley had done the work, he wouldn't take all the credit. He'd rather give it to Marvin and just play a supporting role.

Marvin wasn't one to steal credit. He immediately spoke up for Bradley, "Don't look at me. This was all you. Credit where credit's due."

Bradley looked a bit embarrassed. "It's all thanks to Dr. Finn's guidance."

Marvin waved it off, but the relief in his eyes was clear.

Sebastian furrowed his brows. "Next time, you treat me. And Dr. Finn," his gaze shifted to Marvin, "you should get some rest."

Marvin nodded. "Alright."

Jack finally found a moment to speak, "Mr. Landon, Isabella called earlier."

Seb's expression tightened. "What did you tell her?"

Jack said, "I told her you were with a client and informed the others at the company. No one's spilling the beans."

"Okay." Sebastian paused, feeling his headache ease, then stood up. "Let's go; time to head back."

Just as Sebastian and Jack stepped out of the research institute, Laura's call came through.

Laura said, "Mr. Brown, Isabella came to the company looking for Mr. Landon!"

The call was on speaker, and Sebastian, hearing this, took the phone and asked, "When did she get there?"

"Just now," Laura replied, "Isabella knows you're not at the company. She doesn't look too good."

Seb's heart tightened a bit, and he told Laura, "I'll be back soon. Stay with her in the office for a while."

Laura said, "Okay, Mr. Landon, don't worry."

Isabella, holding Sweetie, sat in Seb's office, looking around. The quiet made her even more uneasy.

Isabella didn't doubt Laura and Jack's words; she just couldn't stand waiting alone at home for Sebastian. Quentin's words kept haunting her, and fear gripped her. So, she took Sweetie in her arms and drove over to find Sebastian.

Even though Jack and Laura told Isabella that Sebastian was with a client at the company, she still felt uneasy. She had to see Sebastian to chill out.

But when she got there, she realized Sebastian wasn't at the company at all.

Her showing up made Laura a bit flustered, like she was about to uncover some big lie.

Honestly, there was no reason to lie to her if Sebastian wasn't at the company.

Isabella thought, 'So, where the heck is Sebastian right now? What was Quentin getting at when he told me to call Sebastian? Did Quentin know something and was hinting at me? Why not just tell me straight up? Why all the mystery?'

A soft knock sounded, and Laura walked in with a fruit platter. She gently closed the office door and walked briskly to Isabella.

Placing the fruit platter down, Laura sat beside Isabella. "Isabella, have some fruit. Mr. Landon will be back soon."

Isabella looked at Laura, her eyes full of doubt. "Didn't you say Sebastian was with a client at the company?"

Laura's eyes flickered. "Yeah. When you called, Mr. Landon was in the meeting room with a client. Later, the client left, and Mr. Landon and Mr. Brown went to see them off. They even mentioned grabbing a bite or something."

Laura's words made it hard for Isabella to figure out. She just listened in silence.

Laura changed the subject, picking up a piece of watermelon and handing it to her. "Want some watermelon to soothe your throat?"

Isabella reached out and took it. "Thanks."

"By the way," Laura suddenly mentioned, "I ran into Leo at the hospital a few days ago."

Isabella paused.

Laura's expression turned sad. Even though several days had passed, she still felt emotional bringing it up. "He doesn't seem to have much time left."

Isabella was shocked. "What do you mean?"

Laura said, "I saw him in the emergency room. He was being wheeled in on a stretcher. He was so thin I didn't recognize him at first. It wasn't until I heard the nurse call his name that I realized it was him. He was already being taken in for tests, and I asked the nurse who brought him in. That's when I found out he had a terminal illness."

Laura's words left Isabella speechless for a moment.

The last time she saw Leo was at Charles's birthday party before the Landon family fell. Back then, Leo was still hooking up with a beautiful woman in the car. How could he have a terminal illness now?

"Are you sure it was Leo?" Isabella found it hard to believe. "Could it be someone with the same name?"

Laura shook her head. "I thought the same at first. But I waited for him to come out and approached him. He didn't acknowledge me, but I recognized him. It was definitely Leo, the Leo we know."

At this point, Laura's eyes reddened. After all, she and Leo had dated for a while. Although Laura was immature, pretentious, and proud at the time, she genuinely liked Leo. When it came to life and death, those memories became as light as dust, distant and insignificant.

Before Sebastian returned, Isabella fed Sweetie another bottle of formula. After burping her, Sweetie fell into a sweet sleep.

Isabella had just put Sweetie down on the bed when the door to the lounge was practically kicked open, and Sebastian stormed in.

Without a word, Sebastian walked over and hugged Isabella tight.

Isabella gently pushed him and whispered, "Shh, don't wake Sweetie!"

She kept an eye on Sweetie as she spoke.

Luckily, Sweetie was full and sleeping like a rock, and the noise Sebastian made didn't bother her at all.

Sebastian held Isabella for a bit before letting go. He grabbed her shoulders and looked her over. "I finished up work and was about to head home when Laura called saying you were here. What's up, Mrs. Landon, you don't trust me and came for a surprise inspection?"

Sebastian said this with a smile, but Isabella could still see the faint traces of weariness he was trying to hide.

Isabella didn't have the heart to call him out and simply asked, "Where did you go?"

Sebastian said, "Just saw off a client and grabbed a bite."

"You already ate?" Isabella sounded a bit disappointed.

Sebastian was about to respond when Laura came in with some food.

It was takeout Isabella had ordered, thinking they could eat together when Sebastian got back. But Sebastian had already eaten out.

A trace of guilt flashed in Sebastian's eyes. He squeezed Isabella's hand and said, "I didn't eat much. I can still have some more."

Isabella finally smiled. "Alright."

Sebastian quickly tidied up the table while Isabella opened the lids of the food containers and arranged them neatly. She then went to the water cooler to get two cups of warm water, but when she returned, Sebastian was nowhere to be seen.

"Strange, he was just here," Isabella said, putting down the cups and looking around.

The office wasn't that big, and the door was still shut; she hadn't heard Sebastian leave. But the door to the break room was ajar, and she could hear water running.

Isabella walked in. Sweetie was still sleeping soundly, Sebastian's jacket was on the bed, and the bathroom light was on, with the sound of water coming from inside.

Standing outside, Isabella could vaguely see a reflection on the glass.

Sebastian raised his arm and tilted his head back, leaning slightly backward. It looked like he was taking medicine.

As she was thinking this, the water stopped, the door opened, and Sebastian walked out.

He came over, took Isabella's hand, and said gently, "Why are you standing here daydreaming?"

Isabella smiled slightly. "I was waiting for you to eat."

As she spoke, her eyes glanced at Sebastian's lips. "What did you..."

"Just washed my face," Sebastian said calmly, leading her out.

Isabella thought Sebastian was probably just wiping his face earlier. After all, his face was still damp with water droplets. Given that they spent every day together, if Sebastian were ill, she would at least not be kept in the dark about it, even if she weren't the first to know. So Isabella didn't dwell on it.

After dinner, Isabella stayed with Sebastian for a bit while he worked, and then they drove home.

Jack hurriedly followed them, carrying his coat. "Mr. Landon, Ms. Miller, let me drive you home?"

When Jack reached downstairs, he happened to run into Kelsey waiting at the doorway.

Kelsey ran over and grabbed Jack's arm. "You said five minutes; why are you just coming down now?"

Jack said, "I had to handle something last minute, which caused a delay," draping his coat over Kelsey's shoulders. He grasped her frail shoulders and said, "It's chilly at night. Why didn't you wear more? Standing here in the draft, you'll catch a cold and have a runny nose by tomorrow. Don't come crying to me then."

"I won't," Kelsey said playfully, "I won't cry to you. I'll just wipe my snot and tears all over you."

Jack was speechless. Clearly, he had never experienced something like this before and didn't know how to handle Kelsey.

Kelsey laughed. "I'm just teasing you. Look at you; your face is all pale."

"Oh, stop it," Jack said seriously, "If you really want to wipe, go ahead."

Kelsey laughed joyfully.

She loved Jack's serious and upright demeanor. Sometimes she teased him just to see his face turn red, which made her very happy.

"I'm hungry," Kelsey said, rubbing her stomach. "Let's go get something to eat? That place we went last time was so good, I want to try it again, and this time I'll add more!"

Jack's eyes were full of affection for Kelsey, and he agreed to whatever she asked, "Alright."

After a while of being lovey-dovey, Kelsey and Jack finally noticed something was off. They turned around and met two pairs of eyes.

Isabella and Sebastian had been standing quietly on the side, watching Kelsey and Jack's display of affection.

Sebastian was expressionless, while Isabella was smiling.

Kelsey felt a bit embarrassed and scratched her head. "Bella, Sebastian, sorry you had to see that."

Isabella waved her hand with a smile. "Go have your late-night snack. Don't let our Kelsey go hungry."

Jack said, "But I need to drive you home."

"Sebastian and I can both drive; we don't need you to," Isabella interrupted Jack and looked at Sebastian for confirmation.

Sebastian said, "Yeah, what she said. Jack, take Kelsey for a late-night snack."

Jack looked at Sebastian worriedly. "If you need anything urgent, just call me. I'll be there right away."

"Okay." Sebastian understood Jack's concern and waved him off. "Go on."

Jack was pulled away by Kelsey.

Isabella watched Jack and Kelsey depart until they were out of sight. Only then did she turn her gaze away, saying, "Shall we return as well?"

"Yes." Sebastian nodded. "I'll drive."

Isabella looked at him. "Are you sure? You've had a long day. How about I drive?"

Sebastian leaned over to fasten her seatbelt and smiled deeply. "You doubt my abilities? Bella, you can question anything, but never doubt my capabilities. If I can't do it, then there aren't many men in the world who can."

Isabella blushed and sat up straight. "Just drive properly."

Sebastian started the car, tapping his fingers lightly on the steering wheel, and smiled. "Don't worry, Mrs. Landon. I always drive properly."

Isabella knew that continuing the conversation would only lead to more teasing, so she decided to stay quiet.

Sebastian, who was in a good mood, drove out of the garage with a faint smile on his face.

But just as the car exited the underground garage, Sebastian's peripheral vision caught a glimpse of a white figure sweeping past a pillar.

Without thinking, Sebastian slammed on the brakes.

###chapter 361 Hatred

The screech of brakes echoed through the underground garage. Before Isabella could even process what was happening, she was jerked forward. Her forehead smacked into the dashboard, and then the seatbelt yanked her back, making the back of her head hit the seat. Her mind went blank, and her ears buzzed like crazy, leaving her temporarily deaf.

The car shook a bit, and Isabella slowly opened her eyes. She turned her head and saw Sebastian getting out of the car, heading somewhere.

"Sebastian?" Isabella called out without thinking.

But Sebastian didn't seem to hear her and just kept walking.

Sweetie, strapped in the child seat in the back, was scared out of her mind. She was already awake, waving her little hands and crying her heart out.

Isabella quickly unbuckled her seatbelt and got Sweetie out of the car.

With Isabella's soothing, Sweetie calmed down a bit, sobbing softly in her arms.

When Isabella looked up again, Sebastian was nowhere to be seen.

"Sebastian?" Isabella's voice echoed in the empty, silent garage.

No answer.

Suddenly, a noise came from that direction, making Isabella freeze for a second. Without thinking, she clutched Sweetie and hurried over.

Isabella walked about a dozen steps when she saw a green passageway. The fire door was half-open, with light faintly coming through.

She walked over and pushed the door open. There stood Sebastian, straight as a board.

Isabella's heart tightened, and she quickly stepped forward to grab Sebastian's hand, only to find his fingertips icy cold, and he seemed totally off.

Isabella moved to his side. "Sebastian? What's up with you?"

Sebastian stayed silent, standing stiffly, staring straight ahead.

Isabella instinctively followed his gaze but couldn't see what he was looking at before the voice-activated lights in the hallway suddenly went out.

The place plunged into darkness instantly. Isabella, scared out of her wits, leaned against Sebastian, letting out a scream.

The lights flicked back on.

Sebastian seemed to snap out of it. Hearing her scream, he raised a hand to hold Isabella's shoulder. "Bella, don't freak out."

Isabella opened her eyes, which were already a bit red. She shrank into Sebastian's arms, holding her daughter with one hand and gripping his wrist tightly with the other, her voice shaking. "Sebastian, what happened? Don't scare me."

"It's nothing." Sebastian patted her shoulder. "Let's go."

"Okay." Isabella nodded, instinctively glancing back. The hallway was empty, nothing there.

Back in the car, Isabella was still visibly shaken, her eyes glued to Sebastian, filled with worry. "Sebastian, what happened to you just now?" she asked anxiously.

Sebastian's hand rested on the steering wheel for a long while before he asked her, "Did you see it just now?"

This question made Isabella's heart race. "See what?"

"A woman in a white dress." Sebastian's expression was dead serious. So serious it sent chills down Isabella's spine. "Did you see her?"

Isabella shook her head, feeling all sorts of confused.

She reached out, her palm gently covering the back of his hand. "Sebastian, maybe you were just seeing things. Who did you see?"

Sebastian said, "My mom."

Isabella suddenly got why Sebastian had freaked out.

"But Anna's been gone for a while, right?" Isabella couldn't wrap her head around it. If Sebastian wasn't tripping, did that mean they just saw a ghost?

Sebastian, looking beat, rubbed his forehead. "Maybe I was just seeing things."

He turned, his eyes lingering on Isabella's forehead for a few seconds. "Sorry, Bella, did I freak you out?"

Isabella shook her head.

Sebastian sighed. "It's my bad."

Isabella said, "Let me drive. You look like you need a break."

Sebastian didn't argue and swapped seats with Isabella.

On the way back, Isabella drove while Sebastian reclined the passenger seat and tried to rest.

Isabella thought for a moment and found some chill piano music on the stereo, turning the volume down low.

Gradually, she heard Sebastian's steady, even breathing.

At a red light, Isabella stopped the car and glanced over at Sebastian.

Even in his sleep, Sebastian's brows were furrowed, like he was wrestling with some deep-seated worries.

Isabella raised her hand, her fingertips gently brushing over his brow, trying to smooth it out.

Sebastian suddenly jolted awake, grabbing her hand tightly and shouting, "Mom, don't leave me!"

Sebastian woke up, his eyes filled with obvious tears.

Sebastian held Isabella's hand, pressing it to his chest. At that moment, his eyes were filled with a sense of brokenness.

Isabella was stunned. At this moment, she seemed to see the young Sebastian.

Even though Sebastian was strong now, the extreme lack of security and the bullying he suffered in his youth were still buried deep in his heart.

Sebastian used to blame all his hatred on Charles and Emma, but now that they were dead and the Landon family was destroyed, he still couldn't find relief.

Isabella suddenly realized that Sebastian's normalcy these days was all an act. He had never truly gotten over it.

Isabella pulled the car over, unbuckled her seatbelt, and leaned over to hug Sebastian gently.

"Bella." Sebastian closed his eyes, his heart aching.

He hated. He no longer hated Charles or Emma. He hated Anna. Or rather, Sebastian hated himself more!

"Sebastian, it's all over. It's all over." Isabella held him, comforting him softly, "Don't think about it anymore. None of it was your fault. Whether it was Charles or Anna, their mistakes had nothing to do with you."

"But I'm just a mistake." Sebastian's eyes were hollow, confused. "A mistake that shouldn't be here."

Isabella shook her head, cupping his face and kissing his lips repeatedly. "You're not a mistake! You're amazing. Your family's problems aren't your fault."

Sebastian nodded, yet the fragility in his eyes remained palpable.

Isabella, feeling a wave of fear, held Sebastian's hand. "Sebastian, let's go see a doctor tomorrow, okay?"

Sebastian was taken aback. He gripped Isabella's hand tightly, saying seriously, "I'm not sick."

Isabella didn't expect him to be so resistant to seeing a doctor and was momentarily stunned. "I know you're not sick. I just think the way you are right now..."

"Bella, I'm fine." The fragility in Sebastian's eyes was slowly vanishing, and his gaze became more determined. "I just need time to process this. You don't need to worry about me."

Isabella was speechless.

Sebastian was like a drunk person, insisting he wasn't drunk even though he could barely walk.

Isabella couldn't argue with Sebastian and felt that his emotions were off at the moment. If she continued, it might backfire. So she decided to drop it for now, planning to persuade him again when his emotions were more stable.

###chapter 362 Half a Month

Back at the crib, Sebastian hit the bathroom for a quick shower.

After tucking Sweetie in, Isabella strolled back to the bedroom and caught Sebastian munching on something as she swung the door open.

Hearing the door, Sebastian turned his back a bit and quickly shoved whatever he was holding into his pocket.

The whole thing took just a few seconds. Sebastian spun around, acting like nothing went down.

"Sweetie asleep?" Sebastian asked.

Isabella nodded, her eyes darting to the corner of Sebastian's mouth.

She was sure she hadn't imagined it; Sebastian was definitely sneaking something behind her back! Since he was hiding it, he clearly didn't want to spill the beans.

A pang of sadness hit Isabella. "Yeah, she's out."

In the end, she didn't press Sebastian about it.

After the shower, they crashed in bed, wrapped up in each other's arms.

Sebastian's breathing got heavier, but even though Isabella was beat, she couldn't drift off.

The day's events, starting with Quentin reminding her to call Sebastian, all felt off.

Isabella was all kinds of confused. She tried to piece it together but was totally lost.

"Sebastian," Isabella called out.

"Can we bump up our wedding?" she asked.

Sebastian's eyes popped open. "Really? Why?"

Isabella hugged his waist and looked up at him. "I don't wanna wait anymore. I wanna be your bride ASAP."

Sebastian ran his fingers through her hair, hesitating a bit. "But the bridal shop..."

"I already checked. The dress and suit can be rushed. I also talked to the officiant; we can move everything up. Just by a week," Isabella said, her eyes full of hope.

He was about to say no, but he couldn't. Sebastian finally nodded. "Alright."

Isabella beamed. "Thanks."

Sebastian leaned down and kissed her for a long time. "Bella, this is what you deserve. Sorry for making you wait."

The next day.

"What?" Marvin shot up from his chair. "I gotta cure you in two weeks?"

Sebastian's face stayed cool as he glanced at Marvin.

Marvin waved his hand. "No way! A month was already pushing it, and now you want it in half the time? You're still in the early stages of treatment. Even if we speed things up, it would take at least three more weeks to fix you up..."

Sebastian looked at him. "Not confident?"

Marvin admitted straight up, "It's not about confidence; it's almost impossible. Do you know how long it usually takes to cure someone with mental illness?"

Hearing "mental illness," Sebastian's frown deepened.

Realizing his mistake, Marvin quickly added, "Mental trauma is also a type of mental illness. In the medical world, it's just a term, not an insult. Even in the best-case scenario, it takes at least three to six months to heal. Mr. Landon, your psychological trauma needs a slow and steady approach; you can't rush it!"

Sebastian listened quietly until Marvin finished, then he suddenly turned to Bradley, who had been sitting silently beside them. "What about you?"

Bradley was caught off guard. "Me?"

He instinctively glanced at Marvin.

Sebastian cut him off, "Don't look at him. I'm asking you. Can you fix me up in two weeks?"

Bradley thought for a moment.

Sebastian added, "If you can, you can be my personal doc like Dr. Finn, or I'll give you a fat stack of cash, or whatever else you want. I'll try to make it happen."

The offer was too good to pass up. The hesitation in Bradley's eyes vanished. He stood up and said, "Mr. Landon, I'm down to give it a shot."

"Bradley!" Marvin couldn't hold back. "What's the first rule of being a doctor? Don't promise a cure without being absolutely sure."

Bradley looked at him, full of enthusiasm. "Professor, I'm confident."

Marvin asked, "How confident? Even if you are, you can't make promises lightly. Do you know how complicated Mr. Landon's condition is?"

"I know." Bradley nodded. "I've gone over Mr. Landon's case multiple times and done a detailed analysis. Check it out."

With that, Bradley handed over his trusty notebook.

Marvin opened it and was a bit taken aback. "You've been doing all this behind my back? Impressive!"

Bradley stayed calm and modest. "It's all thanks to your teaching."

Marvin was speechless.

Normally, Marvin would have felt proud and justified by Bradley's words. But now, holding this thick notebook, Marvin felt a bit overshadowed by his student.

Just then, Jack pushed the door open. "Mr. Landon, the meeting's about to start."

Sebastian stood up, adjusted his sleeves, and said to Bradley, "From today on, you're in charge of my treatment."

Marvin touched his nose, feeling a bit defeated. "Looks like I can retire early."

Marvin didn't complain. He was already planning his next vacation in his head.

Since working for Sebastian, who was a total workaholic, Marvin hadn't had any time off. Now that Bradley was stepping in, he could finally take a break. Marvin imagined a few months of eating, drinking, and having a blast.

Marvin's daydreams were pretty sweet. In just a few seconds, he had almost planned his entire trip. But Sebastian shattered his dreams with a simple statement. "I'm afraid not."

Sebastian walked over and said, "Marvin, I have a very important task for you."

Marvin asked, "What?"

Sebastian rarely spoke to him so seriously, making Marvin a bit uneasy.

Sebastian didn't elaborate but checked his watch. "Come find me later. I'll tell you in person."

After saying that, Sebastian gave Marvin a heavy pat on the shoulder.

Marvin was stunned by the pat. He had a bad feeling. What exactly was this task Sebastian had for him?

###chapter 363  Misstep

The next day, Isabella was up at the crack of dawn, ready to see Esme and the gang off at the airport. Sebastian even pushed back his morning grind to tag along with her.

Next door, it was dead quiet. No signs of life, and even the car was MIA.

Isabella and Sebastian shared a look and were about to knock when the door swung open. Out came a middle-aged woman in plain clothes, lugging a trash bag.

She stopped in her tracks when she saw them and asked, "Who are you?"

Isabella was caught off guard; she'd never seen this lady at Quentin's place before.

The woman was rocking a uniform with a housekeeping company logo.

"I'm looking for Esme," Isabella said.

The woman hesitated and replied, "I only know Mr. Black. He called us."

Isabella pressed, "Where is he?"

The woman said, "He went to the hospital."

"Hospital?" Isabella's anxiety spiked. "What happened?"

The woman shrugged. "No clue. When I got here this morning, Mr. Black bolted out. I asked him, and he said he was heading to the hospital."

With that, she went off to dump the trash.

Isabella felt a wave of panic. She had plans with Esme this morning. What could've gone down that someone ended up in the hospital? Was it Esme?

Sebastian, standing by her side, gave her shoulder a reassuring pat. "Don't stress, I'll call and find out."

He had Quentin's digits, but before he could dial, Isabella's phone buzzed.

Isabella answered, "Hello, Nina."

"Bella." Nina's voice was weary. "Can you come to the hospital now?"

"Nina, you're at the hospital too?" Isabella shot a puzzled look at Sebastian. What were the odds?

It wasn't the time to dig for details over the phone. After getting the department info from Nina, Isabella and Sebastian rushed over.

At the hospital, Isabella was floored to see Nina, her face drained of color.

"Nina!" Isabella called out.

Nina was slumped on a bench, her white dress smeared with dried blood.

"Nina, what happened?" Isabella sat next to her, holding her hand but too scared to move, worried she might hurt her.

Nina shook her head. "I'm fine. This is Elodie's blood."

Isabella was baffled. "Elodie?"

Only then did she notice Quentin and Esme standing a bit away.

"Nina, what happened to Elodie?" Isabella was at a loss.

Nina's eyelashes fluttered. "I accidentally pushed her off the second floor."

Isabella was stunned. "How did that happen?"

Nina closed her eyes. "She showed up at my place last night, demanding to see Richard. I told her he was on a mission and not in Lakina, but she didn't buy it. I grabbed a fruit knife, just to scare her, but she lost her balance and fell off the balcony."

As Nina spoke, she raised her hands. They were also caked in dried blood, still reeking of metal.

Looking at her hands, Nina replayed the scene from the night before, unable to shake it off.

Even though she didn't directly push Elodie, she couldn't dodge the blame. Elodie had fallen right in front of her, tumbling from the second floor. Nina was momentarily paralyzed, and when she rushed to the railing, all she saw was Elodie on the ground, surrounded by a pool of crimson blood.

After some emergency treatment, they managed to save Elodie's life. But, man, she broke her spinal cord in the fall, and now there's a chance she might end up partially paralyzed.

When the doc dropped that bomb, Esme nearly hit the floor. If Quentin hadn't been there to catch her, she would've gone down hard.

Quentin's face was all serious. He asked, "Is there any chance she'll recover?"

The doc just sighed and shook his head, looking all defeated.

Isabella was floored too. She thought they were in the clear when the doc said Elodie was out of danger, but then he hit them with the paralysis news.

Nina was sitting nearby, clutching her dress like it was a lifeline, her face white as a sheet.

Nina didn't mean for any of this to happen. But her mistake had messed up Elodie big time, and now she was drowning in guilt.

Later, they headed to the ward.

Elodie was lying in the hospital bed, looking nothing like her usual self. She was like a flower about to wilt.

After a bit, Elodie slowly came to. She opened her eyes and saw everyone around her bed, her gaze finally landing on Esme.

Elodie tried to sit up, reaching out a hand towards Esme.

"Elodie," Esme's voice was shaky with tears.

Seeing her mom cry, Elodie frowned. "Mom, I want to sit up."

Quentin stepped in, "The doc said you just had surgery. You need to stay lying down for now."

Elodie trusted him, so she lay back down without a fuss.

Her eyes landed on Nina and Isabella. "Mom, I don't want to see them. Make them leave!"

"Okay, okay," Esme quickly agreed, turning to Isabella. "Bella, you and Nina should head out."

Isabella was about to say something, but Esme had already turned back, holding Elodie's hand tight and gently stroking her hair, her fingers trembling.

So Isabella swallowed her words.

In the elevator, Nina stayed silent.

Ever since the doc mentioned the paralysis, Nina hadn't said a peep.

It was a tough spot. Isabella knew Nina felt awful, but Elodie had paid a steep price, and there was no undoing it.

In the car, Isabella grabbed some wet wipes from the glove box and started cleaning Nina's hands.

With just a few wipes, the tissues were stained red with blood. Half the pack was gone before Nina's hands were finally clean.

As the car started moving, Nina looked out the window and realized they were heading towards the Jose family. She frowned and said, "I want to go back to the villa."

Sebastian paused and said, "With what happened to Elodie, Silvercrest will probably send someone over soon. Nina, it's safer for you to stay with the Jose family until Richard gets back."

Isabella hadn't thought of that, but Sebastian made a good point, so she agreed, "Yeah, it's better to stay with the Jose family. More people to watch your back. We can wait for Richard to come back."

Nina shook her head. "If Silvercrest really wants to come after me, hiding with the Jose family won't help. It'll just drag them into this mess."

Nina had a point; Sebastian didn't argue.

Nina said, "Take me back to the villa. Even if Silvercrest sends someone, it'll take a few days. I won't be in immediate danger."

Isabella and Sebastian exchanged a look and finally agreed with Nina. They decided to take her back to the villa.

###chapter 364 Sacrifice

Because of Elodie, Esme and Quentin couldn't head back to Silvercrest just yet.

Elodie had been stuck in bed all day. By nightfall, she was losing it and kept nagging to get up.

Esme said, "Elodie, the doc said you can't sit up yet."

Elodie wasn't having it. "I've been lying here all day; I'm gonna waste away. Even if I can't get out of bed and walk, I need to sit up for a bit."

Esme, unable to resist Elodie's nagging, finally gave in, "Alright, just lie still. I'll adjust the bed so you can sit up and chill for a while."

"Okay." Elodie nodded.

When Esme raised the bed, Elodie sat up but was still half-lying down. Elodie shifted a bit and frowned, "Mom, why do I feel like I can't feel my waist?"

As she spoke, Elodie reached out to touch her leg. "Weird, I can't feel my leg either."

"Elodie," Esme walked over and grabbed Elodie's hand, a bit flustered. "The doc said when you fell from upstairs, you messed up your nerves, and your leg is hurt. Plus, the anesthesia hasn't worn off yet, so it's normal that you can't feel anything now."

"Really?" Elodie was half-convinced.

A knock sounded at the door, making Elodie and Esme look up.

Isabella pushed the door open, carrying a fruit basket and holding a bouquet of flowers. "I came to see Elodie."

Elodie frowned. "Are you here to laugh at me? Get out! I don't need you to visit me!"

Esme said, "Mom, tell her to get out. If it weren't for Nina, I wouldn't have fallen from upstairs and ended up lying here. They're all bad people; I hate them!" She was full of resentment.

Isabella, not wanting to put Esme in a tough spot, graciously said, "Please take these fruits and flowers inside. I won't be coming in."

Esme glanced at Elodie, who was just glaring angrily at Isabella without saying anything. Then Esme got up to take the items.

Unexpectedly, as soon as Esme came over, Elodie started to act up.

Elodie first let out a scream, then grabbed the phone on the bedside table and chucked it over.

Isabella couldn't dodge in time and got hit on the back of her hand by the phone. The intense pain spread instantly, and Isabella's hand trembled twice, almost dropping the flowers.

"Get out!" Elodie's scream came again. "Make her leave; I don't want her stuff. Get out!"

Just as Isabella was about to speak, Esme pushed her out and slammed the door shut.

Isabella stood at the door, hearing Elodie's continued wailing inside, mixed with Esme's gentle coaxing.

Esme said, "Elodie, don't be like this. I'm here; don't scare me."

"Mom." Elodie threw herself into Esme's arms. "I hate them; make them leave. I don't want to see them!"

"Okay, okay!" Esme held Elodie, heartbroken; she agreed, "I'll make them leave; I won't let them come again. Don't worry. As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you."

The sounds inside gradually quieted down. Isabella looked down at the flowers in her arms, suddenly feeling that their bright colors were overly glaring.

Isabella waited outside for about half an hour, but Esme never came out.

She was lost in thought when a pair of men's shoes appeared in her line of sight.

Quentin asked, "Why are you sitting here alone, not going in?"

Isabella looked up. "Mr. Black."

Her gaze flicked to the still-closed door. "I don't want to upset Elodie. Can you help me take these flowers in?"

"Sure," Quentin agreed easily, took the bouquet but placed it on a nearby chair. Then he grabbed Isabella's wrist. "What happened to your hand?"

Isabella's hand was bruised and slightly swollen from Elodie's throw.

She pulled her hand back. "I'm fine."

"Wait here for me," Quentin said, then turned and walked briskly to the nurse's station.

Isabella saw him talking to a nurse, and after a while, he came back with a bottle of medicine.

Opening the cap, a strong medicinal smell wafted out.

Quentin poured some into his palm and reached for Isabella's hand.

Isabella pulled back. "I'm really fine, no need."

"I'm a doctor. You should listen to me. If you don't treat it now, your hand's gonna hurt like hell in a few days, and you might not be able to sleep. It's not too late now. I'll apply some medicine, and the swelling will go down quickly," Quentin said sincerely.

Without waiting for Isabella to respond, Quentin grabbed her hand again and applied the medicine.

Isabella stiffened; then she felt the pain gradually ease where he rubbed. After a few moments, the swelling seemed to disappear. She also noticed that Quentin's technique was very professional.

This reminded Isabella of the last time Quentin saved a cat. She asked instinctively, "What kind of doctor were you before?"

Quentin said, "I studied a bit of everything-psychology, internal medicine, and evne some surgery."

Isabella was slightly surprised. "I didn't expect you to know so much. Why did you stop being a doctor?"

Quentin's eyes flickered. "Because of someone."

This touched on Quentin's personal privacy, so Isabella didn't ask further.

But Quentin looked up and said a name. "Lova Black."

"Lova Black?" This was the second time Isabella had heard this name.

Quentin said, "I mentioned her to you before; she's sick. She has a very strange illness. To find the cause, I researched a lot and even set up a lab. Despite all my efforts, I found nothing."

"A person who can't even find the cause of an illness doesn't deserve to be a doctor," Quentin said with a self-deprecating smile; Isabella felt he was more angry at his own helplessness.

Isabella asked, "Is there really no way to cure it?"

Quentin paused. "There is one way."

Quentin looked up, staring into Isabella's eyes. "But it requires someone willing to sacrifice themselves."

After a few seconds of eye contact with Quentin, Isabella suddenly felt a wave of dizziness. She wanted to look away but found herself drawn into Quentin's deep eyes, as if she sank into a quagmire, unable to save herself.

###chapter 365  Informing

"Hey, excuse me!" Outta nowhere, this dude in a mask barged through.

He slid right between Isabella and Quentin, like he owned the place.

That split second snapped Isabella back to reality. It was like someone dumped a bucket of ice water on her, sending shivers down her spine.

"You good?" Quentin's voice broke through her daze.

Isabella shook her head, still trying to piece together what just happened.

She glanced up, but the masked guy was already gone, vanished down the empty hallway. Weirdly enough, his voice rang a bell.

"Isabella?" Quentin's hand landed gently on her shoulder.

She turned to face him, but every time she locked eyes with Quentin, panic bubbled up inside her. Being close to him made her feel all kinds of uneasy.

Isabella stood up, took a couple steps back, and left the chair. "I'm fine."

After a beat, she asked, "What were you saying about Lova?"

Her memory was fuzzy. She remembered everything before, but Quentin's last words were a blur.

Quentin chuckled, "So you were zoning out while I was talking?"

Isabella felt a bit embarrassed. Was she really spacing out?

The ward door creaked open, and Esme stepped out.

"Mom," Isabella called. Esme quickly put a finger to her lips, signaling for silence. She gently closed the door, walked over, and pulled Isabella away.

Esme's eyes flicked to the flowers and fruit basket. "Bella, take these back. Elodie's a mess right now. This stuff might just set her off more."

Esme's tone was all about protecting Elodie, and she was clearly out of patience.

Isabella got it. She didn't want to argue over this. "Does Elodie know yet?"

Pain flashed in Esme's eyes. "We're still keeping it from her. But she'll find out soon enough."

"I know Nina. She wouldn't hurt Elodie on purpose." Isabella was worried the Black Family would go after Nina. "We can try to make it up to Elodie. As for the Black Family..."

Esme cut her off. "Bella, did you come here just to plead for Nina?"

Isabella was taken aback.

"Elodie's life is wrecked; her future's gone. Nina's your sister, but so is Elodie." Esme shook her head, tears brimming. "Bella, you really let me down."

Isabella felt like she'd been punched in the gut.

She tried to speak, but Esme looked away, leaving her speechless.

Quentin stepped in. "I don't think Bella meant it like that. She brought the fruit and flowers, so let's just keep them. It's her way of showing she cares. I'll take them in. Elodie won't say anything."

Elodie was scared of Quentin, so if he brought the stuff in, she wouldn't complain.

"Fine, you handle it," Esme said, heading back to the ward.

She didn't look at Isabella again, her disappointment clear.

"Elodie's going through hell; Mom's just not handling it well. She didn't mean to snap at you, Isabella. Don't take it to heart," Quentin said.

Isabella forced a bitter smile. "How can I not take it to heart?"

They were both Esme's daughters, but Esme's favoritism towards Elodie was more than a little.

"I gotta go. If there's any news about Elodie, let me know, Mr. Black." Isabella nodded to Quentin and turned to leave.

Quentin watched her go, then furrowed his brows and pushed open the ward door.

"Quentin, did you get me fruit?" Elodie started, but then she recognized the flowers and fruit basket as Isabella's.

Her face fell. "Quentin, whose side are you on? I said I don't want her stuff. Why'd you bring this junk back?"

Quentin set the fruit basket and flowers on the table and turned to her. "Elodie, like it or not, Isabella is still Mom's kid. She's your sister too."

Elodie pouted but didn't argue.

Quentin walked to the foot of the bed, stood still, and stared at Elodie. "Let me ask you, do you love Richard?"

Elodie was stunned, not getting why the topic changed.

Esme, sitting nearby, seemed to sense something, her eyes flickering.

Quentin said, "Answer my question."

Elodie said, "Of course, I love him. Everyone knows I love Richard. I don't know what kind of spell Nina cast on him, making him so infatuated. Just wait, once I'm better, I'll go find her again!"

"You can't go find her anymore," Quentin replied.

Elodie was bewildered. "Why?"

Quentin's gaze fell on Elodie's legs. "Elodie, let me ask you one thing. If getting Richard meant you had to pay with your life, would you do it?"

"I would!" Elodie answered without hesitation, "As long as Richard marries me, I wouldn't mind dying right away."

Quentin nodded. "Now there's an opportunity in front of you. If you seize it, Richard will be yours."

"What opportunity?" Elodie was confused. "Quentin, what are you talking about? Is someone really going to take my life?"

"No one wants your life." Quentin walked around the foot of the bed and approached Elodie. "Elodie, I need to tell you something. Be prepared."

"Quentin!" Esme stood up, her eyes restrained and pained. "Give her some time. Don't tell her right away; it's too ruthless!"

Quentin met Esme's gaze calmly. "Mom, she has to know sooner or later. Whether she goes crazy today or tomorrow, it's just a matter of time. Besides, I believe she can handle it!"

"Quentin." Esme felt powerless.

Esme knew the situation was irreversible and she could do nothing about it.

Elodie looked at Esme and Quentin, not understanding their conversation, and felt anxious. Elodie asked, "What do you mean by going crazy today or tomorrow? What do I need to know? Mom, Quentin, what are you talking about?"

Quentin said, "Elodie. Listen to me carefully. The doctor said you hurt your spine. You might never get out of bed again."

As the words fell, Esme sat down on a chair, silently shedding tears.

Elodie was stunned for a long time before reacting."Quentin, what nonsense are you spouting? What do you mean I might never get out of bed again? Are you implying that I am paralyzed?"

Elodie was just speaking casually, but Quentin nodded lightly in response.

Elodie was struck as if by lightning, standing there in shock.

###chapter 366 Can I Have a Hug?

Isabella hopped into the elevator and punched in Laura's number.

Laura picked up, "Hey, Isabella."

Isabella jumped right in, "Laura, you said you bumped into Leo at the hospital last time. What department's he in?"

Laura hesitated for a sec, then asked, "Wait, are you at the hospital now? Where you at? I'll come find you."

Isabella was kinda shocked Laura was around too. She gave Laura her location and hung tight.

In no time, Isabella spotted Laura strolling in, lugging two big bags.

Laura called out, "Isabella!"

"Just got here?" Isabella grabbed one of the bags, feeling the weight.

Laura nodded, "Yeah, just hit the supermarket for some essentials and porridge stuff."

Isabella peeked into the bag and saw a pot. "What's with the pot?"

"To make porridge," Laura said, hitting the elevator button.

Once they were inside, Isabella asked, "So, what's up with Leo?"

Laura sighed, "Stomach cancer."

Isabella had a hunch it was cancer when Laura mentioned it was serious, but hearing "stomach cancer" still threw her off.

"He's so young. How'd he end up with cancer?" Isabella asked, baffled.

Laura gave a sad smile. "Illness doesn't care about age. Leo started smoking and drinking like crazy in his teens. When we were together, I knew his diet sucked. He even had a stomach hemorrhage once and almost died. He always said his life was worthless; now it really is."

The elevator dinged, and they stepped out.

Laura led the way, and Isabella trailed behind, taking her time.

They reached the end of the hall, and Laura knocked lightly before turning the doorknob.

Isabella followed her in. The room was dim and reeked of disinfectant and other meds, making Isabella's nose wrinkle.

The bed was half-made, but empty. The faint sound of running water came from the bathroom.

Laura dumped the bags on the sofa and quickly went to the window. She yanked the curtains open and cracked the window.

"I've told him a million times, but he never listens. Most people with cancer wanna get better, but he acts like he doesn't care, like he's in a rush to die," Laura said, shaking her head, looking torn between regret and heartbreak.

The water stopped.

A few seconds later, the bathroom door creaked open, and Leo shuffled out in a hospital gown.

Leo used to be skinny, but now he was downright skeletal.

The hospital gown hung off him like a tent, the sleeves flopping around like they were empty.

Leo leaned against the door frame, catching Laura mid-rant. With a smirk, he said, "You're such a nag for someone so young. What's menopause gonna be like for you? Will you turn into a monster?"

Laura shot back, "By the time I'm in menopause, you'll be long gone. So why do you care?"

Leo chuckled, but it quickly turned into a coughing fit. Once he started, it seemed like he couldn't stop.

Leo looked like he might crumble with every cough. At first, he managed to stay upright, but soon he was squatting, hacking away like he was falling apart.

"Bella, grab me a tissue," Laura said.

"Got it." The tissue box was right next to Isabella. She handed it to Leo.

When Leo heard "Bella," he flinched.

Leo fought to stop coughing. When he finally looked up and saw Isabella, surprise flickered in his eyes. But he quickly looked away and took the tissues.

Isabella noticed the blood in Leo's hand and gasped, "Blood!"

Leo quickly clenched his fist, hiding it. "It's nothing."

Leaning against the door frame, Leo slowly stood up. "I'll go clean up."

Not wanting to look too pathetic in front of Isabella, Leo quickly shut the bathroom door.

Laura sighed. "Pride's a funny thing for someone who's dying."

The water ran in the bathroom for a long time before it finally stopped.

Isabella looked up as Leo came out.

He was still hunched, one hand on his stomach, moving slowly.

Isabella didn't know that every step felt like walking on broken glass for Leo.

Leo finally made it to the bed and sat down. After catching his breath, he looked Isabella in the eye.

"Why are you here?" Leo's voice was raspy.

"Laura told me you're here," Isabella said.

Leo smirked. "Figures she'd spill the beans."

Isabella bit her lip. "Was that you in the surgical ward earlier?"

"It wasn't me," Leo lied quickly.

Isabella let it slide. "Leo, you've helped me before. Got any wishes? If it's not too crazy, I might be able to help."

Leo shook his head. "Nah. My life's been a mess; I don't have any wishes."

The room went quiet.

Leo coughed lightly now and then; Isabella could tell he was trying to hold it in.

Every second Isabella stayed was torture for Leo.

Isabella stood up. "I should go."

Leo didn't ask her to stay or see her off; he just sat there, coughing occasionally.

Isabella was at the door when Leo spoke, "Isabella."

"Yeah?" Isabella turned back.

Leo had stood up. He always seemed hunched now, his illness weighing him down. He used to be so full of life, but now even his hair looked sickly.

He smiled at Isabella. "Can I get a hug?"

Isabella was taken aback but then nodded. She turned back and opened her arms.

Leo smiled faintly. He placed his hand on the back of her head and gave her a gentle hug.

After a few seconds, he stepped back. "That's enough. I don't want to pass my bad luck and illness to you."

Isabella said, "Don't say that. No one wants to be sick."

Leo looked at her. "Isabella, if only I had met you earlier."

Maybe if he had met Isabella earlier, he wouldn't have lived so recklessly. Things could have been different, but now, it was too late.

Leo said, "Isabella, watch out for Quentin."

Isabella's eyes widened. "Do you know something?"

###chapter 367 Hypnosis

Leo paused and said, "Dude knows how to hypnotize."

Isabella's heart skipped a beat, and she suddenly thought of what had just gone down. She muttered, "Wait, was Quentin trying to hypnotize me outside Elodie's room earlier?"

No wonder she was so out of it. One second she was fine, and the next, her mind was slipping away.

Seeing Isabella's face go pale, Leo coughed lightly and said, "I'm not totally sure; it's just a hunch."

"No way!" Isabella shook her head.

Given how she felt at the time, it was pretty likely Quentin had hypnotized her. If Leo hadn't barged in, she might not have snapped out of it so fast.

Just a bit earlier, Quentin had mentioned he studied psychology. Hypnosis was a big part of that.

But what Isabella couldn't wrap her head around was why Quentin would dare to hypnotize her in broad daylight? Plus, he didn't seem to do anything; he just stared at her for a few seconds. Could she really have been hypnotized that easily?

In Isabella's mind, she didn't know much about hypnosis. She'd only seen it on TV, where it usually needed some kind of setup and time. For Quentin to hypnotize her so easily, he must be really good at it. And why did he want to hypnotize her? What was his deal?

"Isabella, Isabella?" Leo's eyes showed a hint of concern. "You okay?"

Isabella snapped back to reality. "Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks, Leo. I gotta go now. Take care, and I'll visit when I can."

"Alright." Leo nodded and saw her to the door.

Watching Isabella walk away, Leo finally looked away, a trace of worry in his eyes.

Leaving the hospital, Isabella headed straight to the Landon Group.

Because of the hypnosis thing, she still felt uneasy and couldn't make sense of it, so she thought of talking to Sebastian about it.

While waiting for the elevator, Isabella was still thinking about what happened at the hospital. The recent string of events had her feeling pretty freaked out. It'd be best to sort out Elodie's situation ASAP.

The elevator doors opened, and two people walked out.

Isabella looked up and bumped right into the person in front of her.

"Dr. Finn?" Isabella was stunned for a moment. Then she asked, "Is Sebastian okay?"

Marvin smiled at her. "Mr. Landon is fine. Don't worry."

Marvin arrived empty-handed, a bandage on his nose, while Bradley, trailing behind him, carried a medical kit.

Isabella asked, "Then what's up?"

Marvin explained with a smile, "It's Jack."

Isabella asked, "What's wrong with Jack?"

Marvin said, "Jack is sick."

"What's wrong with him?" Isabella frowned. "He seemed perfectly fine when I saw him this morning."

"It's a private matter," Bradley, standing behind Marvin, suddenly spoke.

Isabella looked at him.

Bradley was a young guy, about her age. He wasn't very tall; his appearance was average. He'd been standing quietly behind Marvin, barely noticeable. Now that he spoke, Isabella took a closer look at him.

First impressions often came from looks. At first glance, Isabella felt a bit put off by this guy.

It was a weird vibe. Bradley's features were soft, but he didn't have that chill, comfy aura Marvin had.

"This is Dr. Bradley Vaughn, my student," Marvin introduced, "And this is Ms. Miller; she was also Mrs. Landon."

Bradley nodded slightly. "Hey, Mrs. Landon."

Isabella nodded back. "You just said Jack has what?"

"Mr. Brown has a private matter," Bradley said calmly, his tone always flat.

Isabella coughed awkwardly. "Since it's private, I won't pry. Is he okay?"

Bradley shook his head. "It's not a big deal."

Isabella said, "That's good."

Marvin jumped in at the right moment, "If there's nothing else, we'll be going."

With that, Marvin quickly pulled Bradley away.

"Dr. Finn, hold up a sec," Isabella called after them.

Marvin and Bradley turned back. "What's up?"

Isabella glanced at Bradley, thinking that since he was Marvin's student, it shouldn't be a big deal. She asked, "Dr. Finn, do you know how to hypnotize?"

Marvin's heart skipped a beat, wondering if Isabella had found out about Sebastian's treatment. But didn't Jack say they kept this from Isabella from the start?

"A little bit. Why?" Marvin asked cautiously.

Before confirming whether Isabella knew, he couldn't spill anything. If he let something slip and Sebastian found out, Sebastian would probably tear him apart.

Isabella asked, "I wanted to ask, how do you usually hypnotize people?"

"It requires some tools," Marvin answered briefly, then asked, "Why the sudden interest?"

"I'm just curious," Isabella deflected, "I've been watching this TV show where the main guy is a super skilled hypnotist. He doesn't need any tools; just a few seconds of eye contact and boom, they're hypnotized. I found it hard to believe. Since I ran into you, I thought I'd ask if it's possible to hypnotize someone that easily, just with eye contact?"

"How is that possible?" Marvin almost immediately shot back, "What kind of scripts are these writers coming up with? They're just making stuff up!"

Isabella asked, "So it's almost impossible?"

"It's not almost impossible; it's completely impossible!" Marvin waved his hand. "These TV shows are all nonsense. If it were that easy, it wouldn't be hypnosis; it would be witchcraft!"

"Really?" Isabella murmured, "But what if someone could actually do it?"

Marvin said, "Then they must have used some other means, not just hypnosis."

Other means? Isabella frowned, deep in thought. What could it be?

Thinking back carefully to the situation at the time, Quentin didn't seem to do anything. His behavior was completely normal.

Marvin glanced at Isabella with a hint of concern. "The script is just the result of the writers' whims, often lacking any sense of intelligence. Just watch it for entertainment and don't let it mess with your head."

"Okay." Isabella nodded, her smile a bit forced.

Marvin paused and asked, "By the way, which TV show are you watching? I'll check it out when I have time."

After watching, he could make a critique video online for his millions of followers. Critiquing from a professional perspective would definitely go viral!

Isabella was taken aback. "I forgot the name of the show."

"Well, I should go. Bye." Isabella, afraid of being exposed, quickly left.

###chapter 368 Private Treatment

Marvin clicked his tongue and frowned. "Man, the chance to go viral just slipped right past me; couldn't even grab it. What a bummer!"

Marvin sighed and shook his head as he turned around, only to find Bradley standing there, staring blankly at the ground.

Marvin patted his shoulder and asked, "What's on your mind, dude?"

Bradley looked up. "Nothing."

After a beat, he added, "Professor, someone really could pull off what Mrs. Landon said earlier."

Marvin stopped in his tracks. "Who?"

Bradley replied, "Terry Campbell."

Hearing the name, Marvin's expression changed, then he nodded. "Yeah, for sure. But there are still more normal folks out there. Finding another twisted soul like Mr. Campbell? Probably not happening."

Bradley stayed quiet.

As they walked out, Marvin seemed to get into the topic, "You think Mr. Campbell is still kicking?"

Bradley stayed silent.

Marvin shook his head and said, "Nah, I bet he's long gone. When that scandalous book of his dropped, his parents probably would've broken his legs. Hypnotizing his sister to fall in love with him? Calling him messed up is putting it lightly; even demons aren't that twisted!"

Bradley's eyes flickered. He muttered, "No matter what people say, it's all just talk. How many folks really know the truth?"

Marvin paused and looked back at him. "Do you know the truth?"

Bradley stayed silent.

After a few seconds, Bradley shook his head and chuckled, "How could I know? I just don't want to badmouth someone without knowing the facts."

Marvin said, "Bradley, you're a sharp student; you see things clearly. I'm leaving Lakina soon and might not be back for a while. I'm counting on you to look after Mr. Landon. Before I go, I want to give you some advice."

Bradley said, "Shoot."

Marvin said, "I know you like to do things your own way. I've seen Mr. Campbell's books on your shelf. I'm not knocking Mr. Campbell, and I can't deny some of his ideas are pretty fresh. Take the good from them, but I'd still advise you to read less of it. Mr. Campbell himself is pretty twisted."

Bradley lowered his eyes. "I'll remember what you said, Professor. Don't worry. I'll take good care of Mr. Landon's illness. I won't let you down."

"Good!" Marvin patted his shoulder, looking pleased.

Bradley reminded him, "Professor, you wanna call Mr. Brown? Otherwise, when Mrs. Landon goes up, your lie's gonna get busted."

"Oh, right, right!" Marvin quickly took out his phone and dialed Jack.

At that moment, Isabella had already run into Jack.

Jack was holding a cup of coffee, planning to bring it to Sebastian.

Every time Sebastian finished treatment, he'd get a slight headache; a cup of coffee would help a lot.

Right now, Sebastian was lying in the office, waiting for Jack's coffee.

Jack was a bit surprised to see Isabella. He asked, "Isabella, what brings you here?"

Isabella caught the shift in Jack's mood and asked, "What's up?"

"Nothing." Jack quickly played it cool. "Just curious. Mr. Landon didn't mention you were coming."

Isabella found Jack's attitude a bit off. Even if he didn't know she was coming, Jack shouldn't have reacted like that.

Though Jack tried to hide it, Isabella still sensed something was up.

Just then, Marvin's call came in.

Jack answered, "Hey, what's going on?"

Marvin said on the other end, "Heads up, Isabella's here to see Mr. Landon. We just bumped into each other at the elevator!"

Jack didn't respond but silently glanced at Isabella standing in front of him.

Marvin continued, "I told her we were here to treat you."

Jack was speechless.

Marvin added, "You better put on a show when you see her later. Don't blow our cover."

Jack was at a loss for words. He really wanted to kick Marvin.

From the first floor to the top floor, the elevator took at least five minutes. But Marvin hadn't called him during those five minutes. Now that he had already run into Isabella, what was the point of Marvin calling him now?

After hanging up, Jack didn't know how to act.

Jack put his phone back in his pocket, then leaned against the wall, pretending to be weak. "Isabella, I'm not feeling well. Can you take the coffee to Mr. Landon for me? I won't go in."

Jack's sudden "illness" was too convenient. Even if Isabella were a fool, she could tell he was faking it.

"Sure." Isabella took the tray and casually asked, "What's wrong with you?"

This stumped Jack. Marvin hadn't given him a story.

Jack didn't answer; Isabella just stared at him, waiting for his response. Her stance made it clear she wasn't leaving until he answered.

In that brief moment, Jack quickly ran through his organs in his mind and finally picked one that suited him. "My stomach's a bit upset, so I had Marvin take a look."

Isabella nodded thoughtfully. Bradley had mentioned Jack had a hidden illness. But Jack said his stomach was upset. Was that a hidden illness? Clearly, it wasn't. Marvin was lying. Jack was also playing along. Why were they lying to her? Was it because of Sebastian? Was Sebastian sick? Was it a psychological issue?

So when she asked Marvin about hypnosis downstairs, Marvin seemed a bit flustered and nervous, which made sense now.

Sebastian wanted to save face, so he always said he was fine in front of her and didn't want to go to the hospital. But in private, he was already having Marvin treat him?

If that were the case, Isabella would pretend she didn't know anything and she wouldn't force him to go to the hospital anymore.

Isabella stood at the door, calmed herself down a bit, and then knocked.

"Come in." Isabella pushed the door open and saw the tall figure lying on the sofa, her heart instantly clenched.

###chapter 369  Missing

It was work time at the office.

Sebastian, who's usually all about that company culture and image, was sprawled out on the sofa, his shirt collar a bit undone. One hand was on his forehead, and even with his eyes shut, he looked super tense, not his usual chill self.

Isabella walked in. Sebastian didn't even bother to open his eyes, still in that same pose. "Get ready, the meeting's still on in half an hour."

Isabella put down the coffee and squatted next to the sofa.

Seb's face was right there. Seeing how rough he looked, Isabella felt a pang of worry. She couldn't help but reach out, and just as her fingers brushed his cheek, Seb's eyes popped open.

His eyes were bloodshot and tired, looking pretty awful.

"Bella?" Sebastian grabbed her hand, his voice raspy. "When did you get here?"

Isabella gave a small smile. "Just now."

Sebastian tried to sit up, but she pushed him back down. "You stay put; I'll give you a massage."

Sebastian nodded. "Alright."

Isabella sat down beside him, and Sebastian rested his head on her lap. She started massaging his temples gently.

After a bit, Seb's breathing evened out and got quieter.

Isabella looked down and saw he'd fallen asleep.

The office was super quiet. With Sebastian right there, Isabella felt really at peace. She leaned back on the sofa and dozed off too.

When she woke up, she was in the lounge. Isabella sat up and checked the clock on the wall. She was surprised to see she'd been out for over two hours!

Isabella went to the bathroom to splash some water on her face, feeling way more awake.

Her phone, sitting on the bedside table, had been buzzing non-stop.

When she checked, there were five missed calls-all from Kelsey.

Just as she was about to call back, Kelsey's call came in again.

Isabella answered casually, "Hey, Kelsey."

"Isabella, is Nina with you?" Kelsey's voice was full of panic.

Isabella shook her head, feeling a bit tense. "No. What's up?"

Kelsey said, "Nina's missing!"

Isabella was shocked, "What?"

Sebastian was in a meeting, so Isabella didn't want to bother him. She drove over to the Jose family's place.

Margaret was holding Sweetie. Kelsey was pacing around, trying to call Nina, but all she got was that annoying "The number you have dialed is unavailable" message.

Seeing Isabella, Kelsey rushed over. "Any news about Nina?"

Isabella shook her head. "I just went to the jewelry company. They said Nina left in the afternoon and hasn't been back since."

Kelsey was freaking out. "Could it be the Black Family?"

Isabella didn't say anything, her face serious. The only guess was that it had something to do with the Black Family. But could they really move that fast?

Margaret stood up. "Bella, can you get in touch with Richard? Steven's on a business trip, and Zaire's not in Lakina right now. The house is full of women, and that's not good. Only Richard can handle this mess. If we can reach him, we won't be running around like headless chickens."

Isabella shook her head. "I don't have Richard's number, but maybe Sebastian does."

She called Sebastian.

A few minutes later, Sebastian called back, saying he couldn't reach Richard either.

Kelsey chimed in, "I remember Nina saying that whenever Richard goes off the grid, you can't contact him. He only shows up when he wants to."

Margaret was getting more anxious. "I've heard Steven mention that the Black Family has a lot of power in Silvercrest; Bruno Black is no saint. If Nina's been taken by them, I'm really scared."

Isabella said, "Margaret, don't worry. I'll go find the Black Family."

Margaret, tears in her eyes, nodded repeatedly. "Please, Bella."

Isabella then rushed to the hospital.

Kelsey was pacing back and forth in the living room. "Mom, I'm going out too!"

"Where are you going?" Margaret was super agitated.

Kelsey didn't want to worry her mom, so she said, "I'm going to find Michael. He might be able to contact Richard."

Margaret snapped out of it. "Right, Michael might know something. But the casino's a rough place, Kelsey. I don't feel safe with you going alone. How about asking Jack to go with you?"

"Mom, don't worry. I've already messaged him. If he sees it, he'll definitely come with me." Kelsey shook her phone, grabbed the car keys, and walked out. "Mom, don't worry. I'll call you as soon as I know anything."

Margaret walked Kelsey to the door and watched her drive away, her heart still heavy with worry.

After thinking it over, Margaret decided to call Zaire.

At that moment, Zaire's plane had just landed in Blossom City.

When he got Margaret's call, he paused. "Mom, don't worry. I'll fly back right away."

After hanging up, Zaire told his assistant, "Get us a ticket back. The soonest one!"

The assistant was a bit confused. "But Mr. Jose, we just landed."

Zaire frowned. "Just do it. Are you questioning my orders?"

The assistant, not daring to ask more, went to buy the ticket.

When he came back with the ticket, Zaire was sitting in the waiting room, head down, typing on his phone. His tall and slender figure looked out of place in the simple waiting room.

The assistant walked over. "Mr. Jose, it's all set. There's a flight in half an hour. We'll fly to Emerald Isle City first and then transfer to Lakina."

"Okay." Zaire didn't look up, still typing on his phone.

The assistant glanced over and saw he was messaging someone.

Just then, a flower-selling girl pushed a cart over and timidly asked, "Sir, would you like to buy some flowers?"

Blossom City was known for its flowers.

This place was full of them. You'd see flower sellers everywhere as soon as you got off the plane.

###chapter 370  Help

Those bright flowers, man, if you sold 'em in a big city, you could make bank, like hundreds of bucks with just a bit of fancy wrapping. But here, where the air's already thick with flower scents, they go for dirt cheap.

So, this young girl had been pushing her flower cart around forever, but barely sold a thing. The cart was a total eye-catcher, though.

But the assistant knew Zaire wasn't in the mood to buy flowers, let alone a whole cart of 'em.

Before Zaire could even say anything, the assistant jumped in to shoo the flower girl away. "We're not buying."

The flower girl got spooked and tried to push her cart away in a hurry.

Zaire suddenly called out, "Wait!"

He put his phone away and waved her over. "Come here."

The girl glanced at the assistant, then slowly pushed her cart closer.

Zaire casually picked a red rose, sniffed it, and said, "Smells nice."

The girl blinked her clear eyes. "Sir, wanna buy some? Buy one, get one free. The more you buy, the more you get."

Zaire smirked. "How much?"

The girl said, "One dollar each."

Zaire raised an eyebrow. "How much for the whole cart?"

The girl was stunned.

The assistant was also taken aback and couldn't help but remind him, "Mr. Jose, it's not practical to take a whole cart of flowers."

Zaire ignored him and asked the flower girl again, "How much for the whole cart?"

The girl finally snapped out of it, looked at the cart full of flowers, feeling all kinds of nervous, "I haven't counted."

Zaire smiled. "No need to count. I'll give you a thousand bucks for the whole cart, okay?"

The girl was shocked and waved her hands frantically. "No need for that much. This cart only has about a hundred flowers. I sold a few this morning, so there should be about ninety left. With the buy one, get one free deal, fifty bucks would be enough."

The girl held up five fingers, but she still got a thousand dollars in cash.

Zaire asked, "Can you do me a favor?"

The girl was stunned. "What favor?"

"In a bit, a girl will come here. Can you give her this cart of flowers?" Zaire's tone was gentle, and he seemed super chill.

The girl said, "Okay."

Zaire smiled slightly. "Thanks."

He then turned to his assistant and asked for paper and pen.

Opening the notebook, Zaire's long fingers held the pen and quickly scribbled two lines. He then tore the page, folded it a few times, and handed it to the girl. "Give this to her as well."

The girl took the paper, her heart pounding. "But sir, how will I recognize her?"

"That's easy." Zaire took out his phone, opened the photo album, and showed her a picture. "It's her."

The flower girl's eyelashes fluttered lightly when she saw the photo on the phone.

"Mr. Jose, we should go," the assistant reminded.

Zaire closed the notebook, stood up, straightened his jacket a bit, and extended his hand to the flower girl. "Please make sure to deliver it."

The flower girl was stunned for a moment, then she carefully extended her hand and lightly shook Zaire's clean, slender hand.

Zaire let go of her hand and glanced once more towards the airport entrance. People were coming and going, but he still didn't see the person he wanted to see.

The assistant called, "Mr. Jose."

Zaire withdrew his gaze. "Let's go."

Zaire turned to leave, while the flower girl stood there, holding the paper in one hand and the thousand dollars in the other, feeling like her heart had floated away.

Twenty minutes later.

Miley showed up at the entrance. She was tall and immediately caught everyone's eye.

Miley scanned the area and finally locked eyes on the flower girl chilling on a bench nearby.

She walked over. "Brenda?"

Brenda Harper looked up at the sound of her name and quickly stood up when she saw Miley. "Miley."

Miley's eyes flicked to the cart of flowers. "Still got some left?"

Brenda shook her head, her eyes darting around, and she clutched the paper tighter. "Yeah, a few."

"Let me give you a hand." Miley said, reaching out to push the flower cart and moving to the side to sell.

Brenda stood there, watching Miley's back. For some reason, when she sold flowers, she always felt like people were looking at her with disdain and contempt, making her feel ashamed and unable to lift her head. But Miley could push the flower cart and walk confidently among the crowd.

Miley's voice was sweet, and her demeanor was charming. After making a round, she had already sold most of the flowers.

Brenda reached into her pocket, squeezed the thousand dollars, and turned to toss the paper into the trash can.

On the way back, Miley found a seat on the bus and closed her eyes to rest.

Brenda kept her gaze on Miley, thinking she was really beautiful.

Miley not only had a beautiful face but also a perfect profile, with soft curves and well-defined features, almost like a movie star.

And as for herself, because she had been working in the flower fields for years, her skin wasn't great, and her looks were pretty average. She was the type that would get lost in a crowd.

Miley suddenly opened her eyes. "Brenda."

Brenda was confused, "Yeah?"

"Why do you keep staring at me? What's up?" Miley asked Brenda with a smile.

Brenda bit her lip. "Miley, how are you so beautiful?"

Miley was taken aback, then burst into laughter. "You just noticed my beauty?"

Brenda shook her head seriously. "I've always known you're beautiful. In our family, you've always been the prettiest."

Miley was in a good mood after Brenda's compliment, and the frustration from being teased faded a lot. She tilted her head slightly, resting her elbow on the window. Her unpainted lips showing a faint pink color, curving up in a charming arc. Miley said, "Keep talking. I love hearing it."

Brenda was speechless.

The bus soon entered the suburbs, weaving through the flower fields along the country road, with a gentle breeze blowing in from the window. They felt particularly pleasant.

Miley squinted her eyes slightly, enjoying the warm breeze filled with the scent of flowers, and the gloom in her heart was gradually dissipating.

Brenda's voice came from beside her. "Miley."

Miley didn't turn her head, just responded, "Yeah?"

Brenda asked, "How can I be like you?"

Miley turned to look at Brenda, who was a bit embarrassed and lowered her head, showing a bit of awkwardness.

Miley smiled slightly. "Our Brenda has finally grown up and knows how to appreciate beauty?"

Brenda was embarrassed. "I'm just envious of you. Miley, can you teach me?"

Miley pondered for a moment, hesitating. "I can teach you, but I'm afraid your mom will find out and scold you for not behaving."

After all, back home, Miley had always been the bad example!

Brenda shook her head. "I'll learn secretly, so she won't find out."

"But..." Miley was still hesitant.

Brenda, afraid that Miley wouldn't agree, quickly took out the money from her pocket and stuffed it all into her hand. "Miley, take all of this. You must teach me. I want to be beautiful!"

When Miley looked at the thousand dollars in her hand, she was stunned. She asked, "Where did you get all this money?"

###chapter 371  Can't Control

Brenda bit her lip and looked away. "I saved up all this cash myself. My folks have no clue."

Miley checked out the money. "But these are all fresh bills."

In big cities, that kind of cash was still pretty common.

But in a small town like this, where flowers were sold one by one, a hundred bucks was already a lot for Brenda. Yet, here she was, pulling out a grand, all in new bills.

Miley wasn't dumb and wasn't buying Brenda's story. "Spill it; where'd you get this money?"

Brenda bit her lip harder. "I found it at the airport."

Miley said, "Then you should hand it over to the cops."

"No!" Brenda quickly grabbed Miley's hands, hesitated for a bit, and finally came clean, "A guy at the airport bought my flowers for a thousand bucks."

Even though Miley wasn't totally convinced, it made more sense than the first story.

The flower market at the airport was pretty basic. People who could afford to fly had some cash; otherwise, Brenda wouldn't have gone all the way there to sell flowers.

Sometimes, there were generous folks who might feel sorry for a kid like Brenda. It wasn't hard to get. For rich people, a thousand bucks was nothing. And buying flowers was just an excuse; maybe it was just a kind-hearted guy feeling bad for Brenda.

"Miley." Brenda clung to Miley's arm and begged, "I wanna keep this thousand bucks for myself. Can you keep it a secret?"

Miley knew exactly what kind of life Brenda had at home.

Miley also felt a bit sorry for Brenda. "Brenda, you gotta promise me that everything you told me is true."

Brenda said, "I swear, everything I said is true, not a single lie!"

Miley sighed. "Alright. I'll hold onto this thousand bucks for you. If you need it, come to me."

Brenda let out a sigh of relief and finally felt at ease. "Thanks, Miley."

"No problem," Miley said.

After that, Miley leaned against the window, staring blankly at the big flower fields outside.

When they got off the bus, they still had to walk a bit to get home.

Brenda pushed the flower cart ahead, while Miley followed leisurely behind, her eyes glued to her phone.

The whole way, Miley was waiting for Zaire's call. But all she got was disappointment.

"Stupid guy!" Miley cursed.

Brenda turned around. "Miley, what did you say?"

"Nothing," Miley replied, then blocked Zaire's number.

Brenda waited for Miley to catch up and asked, "Miley, I heard you came back this time to get hitched?"

Miley responded nonchalantly, "It's for a blind date."

Brenda asked, "Oh, have you gone on the date?"

Miley smirked. "I've been on two dates already."

Brenda asked, "Neither worked out?"

Miley nodded. "Nope."

Brenda asked, "Miley, what kind of guy do you like?"

Miley replied, "Handsome, rich, and a bit cheeky sometimes."

Brenda didn't get it. What kind of trait was that?

Brenda thought of the guy who bought flowers at the airport today, and her mind wandered a bit. "Miley, you went to college in Lakina and stayed there for more than a year after graduation. Didn't you date anyone?"

Miley grinned. "Oh, I dated a bunch."

Brenda bit her lip. Could the guy she saw today be one of Miley's exes?

Brenda asked, "Miley, do you have someone you like?"

"Nope," Miley answered without hesitation.

Brenda thought, 'Miley's quick answer must mean she really doesn't, right?'

Brenda's mind flashed with Zaire's image again, and her cheeks felt a bit warm. "Miley, are you going back to Lakina?"

"I dunno." Miley pulled two blades of grass from the roadside and quickly wove them into a grass ring with her fingers. She put it on her finger to admire it, then she took it off, tossed it into the air, and kicked it into the nearby flower field.

Brenda didn't say anything more.

Isabella went to the hospital and ran into Sebastian downstairs.

Isabella asked, "Why are you here? Weren't you in a meeting?"

Sebastian took her hand. "Nothing's more important than you, Bella. You should've told me from the start."

Isabella said, "I just didn't want to distract you."

Sebastian said, "Silly girl."

Isabella and Sebastian went upstairs and opened the door to the hospital ward, only to find the bed already cleaned up, with no one inside. Even the patient name cards at the head and foot of the bed were gone.

A nurse happened to come in with some bedding. Seeing them, she asked, "Who are you looking for?"

Isabella said, "I'm looking for Elodie."

The nurse said, "Oh, she moved upstairs. You can find her there."

Isabella didn't get why Elodie moved upstairs until Sebastian and she went up and found the entire floor cleared out.

As soon as they stepped out of the elevator, two tall guys in suits blocked their way. "From now on, this floor is occupied by Ms. Black. Please leave."

Isabella and Sebastian exchanged a glance. So, the Black Family really sent someone over?

Elodie suddenly moved wards, which meant Nina must have fallen into the hands of the Black Family.

"I'm looking for Esme," Isabella said urgently, "My name is Isabella. Could you please inform her?"

The two bodyguards glanced at her and said indifferently, "Mrs. Black is ill and is also resting. Without Bruno Black's orders, no one can disturb her."

"What?" Isabella was stunned. Esme was also ill?

Isabella was confused. "But when I came this morning, she was fine. How did she suddenly get sick?"

The bodyguard was very cold, raising his hand slightly. "No comment. Please leave immediately."

Isabella wanted to say more, but Sebastian gently squeezed her hand and led her away.

As the elevator doors closed, Isabella said, "My mom is also sick, but she was fine this morning. How did she suddenly get sick? And now I can't reach her by phone."

Sebastian said, "Given the situation, it's clear that the Black Family has sent people over. Whether Esme is really sick or not is unknown, but it's likely that you won't be able to see each other for a while."

Sebastian's words made Isabella's heart sink. The Black Family probably did it on purpose to prevent Esme from sseing her.

"What about Nina? Will they do something to her?" Isabella was most worried about Nina.

Sebastian said, "For now, we can only wait for Richard to come back."

###chapter 372 Intimacy

Night rolled in.

Casino No. 1.

"Ms. Jose, we've told you a million times, Michael ain't here."

Kelsey scowled. "No way! I saw his car in the lot. I really need to talk to him; this is serious."

"But Michael's not here."

Kelsey waved them off. "I'll find him myself."

"Hey, Ms. Jose, wait up!"

No one dared to stop her. Everyone who knew Michael knew Kelsey was the one on his phone screen.

Kelsey barged into one private room after another, only finding gamblers lost in their games. No Michael.

Even the two bodyguards who had been following her were now gone.

Kelsey realized Michael was dodging her.

"Well, if it isn't Ms. Jose?" A mocking voice came from the side.

Kelsey turned. First, she saw a floral shirt, then a grinning face.

"Wow, talk about a face only a mother could love," Kelsey shot back.

Kevin's smile faltered. "Ms. Jose, still as blunt as ever."

Kelsey ignored him and turned to leave.

Kevin called after her, "Looking for Michael?"

Kelsey paused. "Yeah. Why?"

"I know where he is," Kevin said.

"You?" Kelsey looked doubtful.

The Anderson family had fallen ages ago, and even at their peak, Kevin wouldn't have been on Michael's radar.

Kevin smirked. "Don't believe me?"

"Nope," Kelsey replied.

"Then forget it." Kevin turned to leave.

"Stop!" Kelsey frowned.

Kevin stopped, raising an eyebrow. "What, you believe me now?"

Kelsey walked over, giving him a disdainful look. "Where is he?"

Kevin grinned. "This info ain't free, you know."

Kelsey scoffed. "How much? I'll transfer it."

Kevin replied, "How about you buy me a drink first, and we chat?"

He reached out, trying to touch Kelsey's face.

Kelsey felt a wave of disgust, her fists clenched, ready to strike, when suddenly a hand grabbed Kevin's.

With a slight twist, Kevin yelped in pain, squatting down. "It hurts!"

Kelsey turned, her eyes lighting up. "Michael!"

Michael didn't look at her, just glared at Kevin. "Looks like I need new security. How'd they let you in?"

Kevin's face went pale, begging, "Michael, I'm sorry. Please, my hand's gonna break."

Michael sneered. "Ask Ms. Jose if she'll let you go."

"Ms. Jose, I'm sorry. I won't do it again; please let me go," Kevin pleaded.

Kelsey was speechless. She'd seen people grovel, but never like Kevin.

"Forget it." Kelsey waved her hand. "Let him go."

Michael released him; Kevin scrambled away.

Michael dusted off his hands, looking at Kelsey indifferently. "You were looking for me?"

"Michael, do you know where Richard is?" Kelsey asked.

Michael shook his head. "Nope."

After that, Michael turned to leave.

Kelsey quickly followed. "Can you contact Richard? Nina's missing, probably taken by the Black Family. We need to tell Richard ASAP."

Michael paused, giving her a side-eye. "What's that got to do with me?"

Kelsey was stunned, and he kept walking.

She jogged to catch up. "Michael, you're Richard's right-hand man and his friend. If Richard finds out you didn't tell him about Nina, he'll definitely come down on you."

Michael clearly wasn't listening. "If Richard punishes me, I'll take it. The rest isn't my problem. Ms. Jose, you're barking up the wrong tree; try someone else."

He reached a door, and the two bodyguards opened it for him.

When Kelsey tried to follow, they stopped her, and the door shut in her face.

At three in the morning, Michael finally came out.

"Michael." A subordinate at the door gestured with his eyes.

Michael paused, spotting Kelsey leaning against the wall.

With her knees bent, she had her arms wrapped around them, head resting on her forearms, eyes closed, asleep.

The subordinate whispered, "Michael, Ms. Jose's been waiting here for hours."

Michael hesitated, then walked over. He squatted in front of Kelsey, quietly watching her sleep.

Kelsey's breathing was light and soft, like a sleeping kitten, making him reluctant to wake her.

"Michael." A sultry voice called out. Kathy Nelson, in a red dress, swayed over, annoyed at the scene. "Michael, you promised to hang out with me after you were done. Why haven't you come yet?"

Kelsey woke up from the noise. She opened her eyes to see Michael in front of her and instinctively grabbed his wrist. "Michael!"

Michael looked down at her hand, not reacting.

Kathy was displeased. "Michael, who is she? You promised to be with me tonight. I've been waiting for two hours; you can't just ditch me."

"Michael, please help me contact Richard. I'm begging you," Kelsey pleaded, still focused on the issue.

"I told you, I can't handle this," Michael said, removing Kelsey's hand and standing up.

Kathy immediately clung to him, wrapping her arm around his, almost sticking to him. "Michael, let's go?"

"Okay," Michael responded, then instructed his subordinates, "Take Ms. Jose home."

The two subordinates nodded. "Yes, Michael." They turned to Kelsey. "Ms. Jose, let's go."

"Michael!" Kelsey stood up quickly, but her legs were numb from squatting too long. She almost fell.

"Ms. Jose!" The two subordinates reached out to support her.

But Michael was faster, grabbing her wrist with one hand and steadying her waist with the other.

Kelsey's legs were weak, and she leaned into his arms. The intimate gesture made both of them tense up.

Realizing what was happening, Kelsey immediately tried to push Michael away, but as she exerted force, Michael tightened his grip on her wrist and waist, pulling her closer.

Kelsey looked up, glaring at Michael. "Michael!"

###chapter 373 Choose the One with the Strongest Fist

Michael smirked, his thumb brushing her wrist, fingers tracing lazy circles. "Didn't you ask for my help?"

Kelsey gulped. Yeah, she did ask Michael. For Nina's sake, swallowing her pride and asking Michael was no biggie.

Kelsey stopped resisting and softened her tone, "I'm begging you."

Michael turned his head slightly, giving her a side-eye.

Kelsey asked, "What for?"

Michael said, "Kiss me. Then I'll think about it."

Kelsey was ticked off. "Michael, I have a fiancÃ©."

"Oh." Michael dragged out the word, suddenly glancing behind her. "Is that your fiancÃ©?"

Kelsey spun around, startled, seeing Jack striding over.

"Jack." Kelsey stiffened.

Jack's steps were long, his face icy, eyes blazing with anger.

When he got close, Jack yanked Kelsey aside and swung a punch at Michael.

Kelsey screamed.

Michael's eyes narrowed. He wasn't about to just take a hit. As Jack swung, Michael dodged and landed a punch on Jack's cheek instead.

Jack turned slightly, moving fast. After taking that punch, he immediately started brawling with Michael. They traded blows, fighting fiercely.

Kelsey tried to step in several times but got shoved away.

Kathy, seeing this, bit down on a cigarette and leaned against the door, watching the chaos.

Around her, casino folks were gritting their teeth when Michael got hit and cheering when Jack did. But without Michael's say-so, no one dared to jump in; they just watched.

Jack was no match for Michael. After a few rounds, Michael had the upper hand. Jack tried to hold his ground but soon couldn't fight back.

Michael's crew was hyped, shouting.

"Go, Michael!"

"Michael's a beast. This guy's toast, thinking he can take on Michael. Doesn't he know Michael used to box?"

"Hahaha, he's done for."

Jack lost his balance and hit the ground after another punch from Michael.

Michael, fueled by the crowd's cheers, had no plans to stop. Even with Jack down, he wasn't letting up. He crouched, raising his iron-hard fist high.

If Michael's punch landed, Jack would be half-dead!

"Serves him right!"

"Michael, teach him a lesson!"

"Yeah, give him what he deserves!"

The crowd roared.

Michael's eyes were bloodshot, veins bulging on his arm.

Just as Michael was about to land the punch, two soft hands wrapped around his arm.

Michael paused.

The cheering stopped abruptly.

Kathy, leaning against the door, raised an eyebrow, exhaling a puff of smoke.

Michael turned his head, his bloodthirsty eyes meeting a pair of tearful ones. He was stunned.

"Michael, that's enough!" Kelsey's tears fell.

Michael's fist seemed to lose its strength with Kelsey's tears. He slowly lowered his hand, stood up, and shook it off.

"Jack." Kelsey immediately let go of Michael's hand and bent down to help Jack. Her voice was thick with sobs. "Are you okay? Let's get you to the hospital."

"I'm fine." Jack raised his hand, wiping away Kelsey's tears.

Michael stood there, unmoving.

Michael's henchmen couldn't hold back, chiming in one after another.

"Ms. Jose, a bet's a bet. We all saw it; your man started it!"

"Yeah! Michael's hurt too. Why don't you care about Michael?"

"Exactly, Ms. Jose. What's so great about this guy? You should be with Michael. A woman should choose a strong man. How can you show off a weakling like this?"

"Shut up!" Michael snapped, kicking one of the henchmen.

The henchmen immediately fell silent.

Kelsey helped Jack, walking away without looking back.

"Michael..." Michael's henchmen still wanted to say something.

Michael shouted, "Get lost!"

The henchmen quickly scattered.

Kathy dropped her cigarette butt, crushed it with her high heel, and walked over, pressing herself against Michael. "Michael, don't waste your energy on losers. I'll keep you company."

Michael grabbed Kathy's hand, a wicked smile on his lips. "Alright."

With that, Michael pulled Kathy over, pinning her against the wall and kissing her.

Michael's kiss was aggressive, making Kathy almost breathless. Her arms hung weakly around his neck.

"Excuse me." Kelsey returned, seeing the heated scene and instinctively looking away.

Michael paused. He tried to turn away, but Kathy cupped his cheeks, continuing to kiss him.

Kathy's kiss was soft and sweet, full of flattery, very enticing.

Michael was a bit distracted but didn't push her away. His large hand caressed Kathy's slender waist, continuing to enjoy it.

Kelsey had to speak again, "Excuse me."

This time she raised her voice, trying to interrupt Kathy and Michael.

But it didn't work. They acted as if they didn't hear Kelsey; they continued without any intention of stopping. Or rather, Kathy and Michael were doing it on purpose, simply ignoring Kelsey.

Kelsey felt that staying here any longer was useless; Michael wasn't going to help her today. So Kelsey stood there for a few seconds, then she turned to leave.

As soon as Kelsey left, Michael pushed Kathy away by her shoulders.

He turned, looking at the empty hallway, his eyes dark.

Kathy panted in his arms. "Michael, take me to your room."

Michael's eyes showed a hint of arousal. She needed to seize this opportunity and take him down quickly.

But Michael pushed her away. "Enough. I'll have someone take you back."

"Michael." Kathy tried to get close again but was stopped by Michael's sharp glare.

Kathy knew Michael's temper and understood that it was over for today. If she pushed further, it would cost her life.

Kathy adjusted her dress slightly and kissed Michael's cheek before leaving. "Goodnight, Michael."

Michael squinted, remaining silent.

After Kathy left, he took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, lit one, and started smoking.

After a while, Michael finally took out his phone and dialed a number.

Michael said, "Hey, Richard, something happened!"

###chapter 374 The Phone Call

When Kelsey stepped out, Jack was already chillin' in the car, waiting for her.

Jack's face was still messed up, blood trickling from his eyebrow and a nasty cut on his lip.

"Let's hit the hospital first," Kelsey said, buckling up, but Jack grabbed her hand.

"Why'd you go see Michael without a heads-up?" Jack's voice had that accusing edge.

Kelsey blinked, caught off guard. "I didn't wanna hold you up. Plus, it's not my first rodeo at Casino One; didn't think it'd be a big deal."

"You didn't think?" Jack scoffed. "If I hadn't shown up, would you have kissed him?"

Kelsey was floored. "What are you even saying? No way I'd kiss him!"

Jack shot back, "But you were all over each other."

Kelsey's eyes showed a flicker of hurt. "Is that really what you think of me, Jack?"

Jack looked away. "Just calling it like I see it."

"Look, I waited outside for Michael for hours, my legs went numb. When I got up, I almost face-planted, and Michael just helped me up," Kelsey explained, her voice tinged with frustration.

Jack stayed silent, not saying a word.

Kelsey pulled her hand back. "Fine, let's get you to the hospital."

"Nope," Jack said, "I'm taking you home first."

Kelsey insisted, "Hospital."

Jack shot back, "Home first!"

Kelsey pointed at his face. "But you're still bleeding."

Jack grumbled, "I'm good; home first!"

The car was thick with tension.

Kelsey glanced at Jack, but he kept his eyes straight ahead, like he was dodging any real talk.

Kelsey, stubborn as ever, couldn't stand the misunderstanding. She didn't wanna explain anymore and floored it towards the Jose family's place.

When they got there, Kelsey didn't say a word, yanked the handbrake, and got out.

She walked a few steps before hearing the car door open and close behind her, followed by footsteps.

Kelsey bit her lip, thinking she'd forgive Jack if he'd just come over, hug her, and apologize for doubting her. So she slowed her pace, waiting for him.

But instead, she heard the car door open and close again, then the engine starting.

When Kelsey turned around, Jack was already driving off.

"Jack!" She took a couple of steps forward, but his taillights vanished around the corner.

Kelsey stood there, feeling like all her energy had been sucked out. She just stood there, tears streaming down her face.

Another set of headlights flashed, and a car rolled up.

Kelsey quickly wiped her tears. When the car pulled into the yard, she saw it wasn't Jack's, but Zaire's.

"Why are you standing out here in the middle of the night?" Zaire got out, walked over, and draped his coat over Kelsey. "Why are your eyes all red? Who messed with you?"

"Zaire," Kelsey said, feeling all kinds of hurt, and threw herself into Zaire's arms, crying her heart out.

Zaire was stunned. "Did Jack mess with you? I saw his car leaving when I pulled up."

Kelsey just cried, not saying a word.

She'd held it in all the way, and now that she finally had someone to lean on, Kelsey just wanted to cry and let out all the hurt she'd been bottling up.

Zaire whipped out his phone. "Hold up, lemme call him and see what's up!"

Kelsey quickly stopped him. "It's not his fault. It's on me."

Just then, Zaire's phone buzzed.

He answered, and Richard's voice came through. "I'll handle Nina's situation. Tell Margaret not to stress; I'll bring Nina back."

And with that, Richard hung up.

Kelsey asked, "Who was that?"

Zaire replied, "Richard."

Kelsey asked, "Richard? What did he say?"

Zaire said, "He said he'd bring Nina back and told us not to worry."

Kelsey let out a sigh of relief. "Wait, you have Richard's number? Why didn't you say so earlier? I wouldn't have had to go to Casino One."

Zaire shook his head. "I don't have Richard's number."

Kelsey asked, "Then what was that?"

Zaire looked at the call log. "It's a virtual number. Saving it is pointless; calling back will just hit a dead end."

"So mysterious?" Kelsey said, "What exactly does Richard do?"

Zaire shrugged. He had no clue either.

"Did you go to Casino One to find Michael?" Zaire asked as they walked into the house.

"Don't even mention him," Kelsey said angrily. "I begged him for hours, and that cold-hearted jerk still refused to help. He even beat up Jack!"

Zaire raised an eyebrow. "Are you sure Michael didn't help you?"

"Of course!" Kelsey said. "If he had helped, I wouldn't have come back so late."

Especially since Michael caused her to have a fight with Jack. Michael was such a jerk!

Zaire shook his head and laughed. "If he didn't help you, how did Richard call me?"

Kelsey was speechless.

Right. None of them could contact Richard, only Michael could. If Michael hadn't helped, how would Richard know about Nina's situation and call Zaire?

Kelsey blinked, still a bit skeptical. "But I spent half the night at Casino One; Michael never agreed. Could Richard have found out from somewhere else?"

Zaire raised an eyebrow. "I don't know."

Kelsey said, "It must be. It definitely wasn't Michael who helped. He's not that kind-hearted!"

Zaire said, "You have a big prejudice against Michael, don't you?"

Kelsey frowned. "He's definitely not a good person."

Zaire laughed. "Silly Kelsey."

Because of Nina's situation, Isabella was worried and didn't sleep well all night.

The next morning, Isabella had no appetite for breakfast.

Fortunately, Zaire called Sebastian in time and told him about Richard's call last night, which made Isabella feel a bit relieved.

After Isabella finished her breakfast, Jack came to pick up Sebastian.

When Jack walked in, Isabella and Sebastian saw the injuries on his face.

Sebastian asked, "What happened to your face?"

Jack remained expressionless. "I accidentally bumped it."

Clearly, it wasn't. Even if it was a bump, it couldn't have caused such severe injuries.

Judging by Jack's appearance, it looked more like he had been in a fight.

This was ultimately Jack's personal matter. Since he didn't want to talk about it, they didn't press further.

Sebastian asked Isabella, "What's your plan for today?"

Isabella pondered for a moment and said, "I plan to wait a bit longer to see if Quentin returns. I want to ask about how Mom and Elodie are doing."

Sebastian paused and nodded. "Alright, keep your phone on. Call me if anything comes up."

Isabella said, "Okay."

###chapter 375 Vigilance

After Sebastian took off, Isabella loaded the dishwasher. Just as she finished cleaning up the table, she heard a car engine revving next door.

Peeking through the kitchen window, she saw Quentin's car pulling in.

Without thinking twice, Isabella headed out to find Quentin.

Quentin had just stepped out of his car and was about to head inside when he spotted Isabella and paused. As she got closer, he said, "I know what you're gonna ask. Come inside with me."

With that, Quentin walked into the house.

Isabella hesitated, then slowly followed. She stopped at the doorway, too scared to go in.

She knew Quentin was bad news and didn't want to be alone with him unless she had to.

Once inside, Quentin tossed his coat on the sofa and went to the water cooler to pour a glass. When he turned and saw Isabella still at the door, he walked back with the glass in hand.

"Why aren't you coming in?" Quentin asked, sipping his water. He looked chill, just like when Isabella first met him and thought he was a nice guy.

But the more she got to know him, the more she realized Quentin wasn't as harmless as he seemed.

The Black Family was no joke. Growing up in that mess, Quentin couldn't be a simple guy.

Isabella was too naive, always seeing the good in people.

"Mr. Black, I just have a few questions," Isabella said.

Quentin took a couple more sips, still all polite and gentlemanly. "Come in and sit down to talk."

He walked over, bent down, and pulled out a pair of brand-new slippers from the shoe cabinet, placing them in front of Isabella.

Just as Isabella was about to speak, Quentin's phone on the coffee table started ringing.

Quentin gestured and walked over to answer, "Hello, yeah, I just got back from the hospital. Mom's fine, Elodie."

Isabella strained to listen but couldn't catch what Quentin said next.

The call dragged on. Even after two minutes, Quentin showed no signs of wrapping it up. The convo was still about Esme and Elodie.

From Quentin's tone, it sounded like he was talking to an elder in the Black Family, and there might be info Isabella needed.

As Isabella debated whether to go inside, she suddenly felt something furry brush against her calf.

Isabella looked down and saw the cat named Cheese circling her feet. Its upright tail brushed against her calf, giving her the creeps.

When Isabella looked down, the cat seemed to sense it and slowly lifted its head, its eerie eyes locking onto hers.

Cheese suddenly bared its teeth, its cry both shrill and fierce. In the next second, it bit Isabella's calf.

Isabella didn't even have time to react before the sharp pain shot up her leg, deepening her dislike for cats. "Cheese!" Quentin's voice sounded near her ear, making the cat dart away, disappearing around the corner.

Isabella felt a tight grip on her wrist as Quentin yanked her into the house and slammed the door shut.

Everything happened so fast. Isabella didn't even have time to react. Seeing the door closed, she panicked and instinctively reached out to open it, but it was locked. She twisted the knob a few times with no luck.

Isabella turned to look at Quentin, her eyes full of fear.

Quentin looked at her and grinned. "Why you so scared of me?"

Isabella was speechless.

But her face gave her away; she had this weird mix of dislike and fear for Quentin.

She pulled her hand back from his grip, trying to keep it cool. "I just wanna ask about Mom and Elodie. I don't wanna bother you."

Quentin's eyes drifted to her bleeding calf. "Before you ask, can I help you with that bite?"

Isabella shook her head. "No need."

Quentin insisted, "Cat bites can be nasty. You sure you don't wanna handle it now?"

Isabella pressed her lips together, feeling like he was pushing it. "I'll get a shot after I ask my questions."

Quentin didn't push further, just nodded. "You wanna know how Mom and Elodie are doing?"

"Yeah." Isabella nodded. "Sebastian and I went to the hospital, but the floor where Elodie is staying is locked down. We couldn't get in. Mom's phone is also unreachable. I'm really worried about her. Can you tell me how she is now?"

Quentin said, "Mom's fine. The doc said she fainted from exhaustion while taking care of Elodie. She's okay now, so don't stress too much."

Isabella let out a small sigh of relief. "That's good. What about Elodie?"

Quentin's eyes darkened, and his tone got serious. "She's not doing well."

Isabella's heart skipped a beat. "What's wrong?"

Quentin said, "She knows about her paralysis and couldn't handle it. She tried to off herself but was stopped."

Isabella's lips moved, but she didn't know what to say.

Even though it wasn't Nina's fault, she couldn't dodge the blame. No matter how she looked at it, Isabella was on the side of the one who caused it. No matter how many times she apologized for Nina, it felt pointless.

Quentin said, "Bruno already knows about this. You can see the situation. I'm afraid Nina's in deep trouble this time."

Isabella's eyelashes trembled, and she asked urgently, "Has Nina been taken by Bruno Black's people?"

Quentin nodded. "Yeah."

Isabella asked, "Where is she now? Can I see her?"

Quentin sighed. "Sorry, Bella, I can't help you with that. Honestly, I don't even know where Nina is."

Isabella knew things were bad, but she didn't think it was so bad that even Quentin couldn't help.

Her mind was racing. "What will Bruno Black do to Nina? This is a law-abiding society. How can he just take someone and lock them up?"

Quentin looked at her, his gaze intense. "Bella, you probably don't get how powerful the Black Family is."

Isabella really didn't get it.

Before this, she was just a regular person and had never heard of the Black Family in Silvercrest. And she didn't know much about Bruno either.

Isabella had asked Sebastian and learned that the Black Family had serious clout in Silvercrest, and Bruno was a ruthless guy.

To get rid of Nina, or even kill her, the Black Family probably had a thousand legit ways!

"Don't worry," Quentin said again, "I've heard that Richard is on his way back. He should be back by tonight at the earliest. He'll talk to Bruno."

Isabella kept her distance from Quentin, avoiding eye contact. "Thanks. I won't bother you anymore. I'll leave now."

She said this, but the door was locked. Whether she could leave was up to Quentin.

"Mr. Black, could you please unlock the door?" Isabella asked.

Quentin paused, then stepped forward and unlocked the door.

Isabella immediately opened the door and left.

###chapter 376 Late

Isabella hit up the hospital to get her vaccine, patched up her wound, and was about to roll over to the Jose family when her phone buzzed with a call from some unknown number.

A weird female voice came through. "Is this Isabella?"

Isabella replied, "Yeah, who's asking?"

The voice on the other end said, "I'm Nina's assistant, Amy Parker."

Isabella knew this Amy girl; she worked at Nina and Isabella Jewelry and was fresh outta college with a degree in jewelry design.

Amy continued, "I couldn't get ahold of Nina, so I had to dig up your number."

Isabella's gut told her something was up at the company.

She said, "No worries. Spill it."

Amy's voice was shaky. "We locked in a partnership, and the signing's supposed to be tomorrow. But Nina's been MIA for days, and our partners are getting pissed. If this keeps up, we might lose them."

Isabella pulled out of the parking lot and asked, "Can I sign it?"

Amy was stunned. "Where's Nina?"

"Nina's sick," Isabella fibbed, not wanting to make a scene. "I know a bit about this deal; Nina mentioned it to me. Plus, I'm a shareholder at Nina and Isabella Jewelry, so my signature counts."

As long as the contract got signed, who cared?

Amy hesitated, probably sensing the BS about Nina being sick. Something was definitely off since Nina had been AWOL for days. But since Isabella wasn't spilling, Amy didn't push. The priority was getting that contract signed.

Isabella, being Nina's sister and a shareholder, was the best bet to handle this.

"I'm just worried the partner won't buy it and think we're not serious," Amy fretted.

Isabella skimmed the contract Amy sent her and said, "Let's give it a shot. If they've waited this long, they still wanna work with us."

Amy nodded. "Yeah. Nina showed them a design sketch, and they were sold. Harmony Jewelry made a bid too, but Nina's design was more unique, so they picked us. If Nina wasn't 'sick,' the contract would be signed by now."

Business was a battlefield, full of twists and turns. Deals could slip through your fingers in a heartbeat. The fact that the partner waited this long showed they really wanted this collab. Every second was torture for Amy and everyone at Nina and Isabella Jewelry. Only a signed contract would end the agony.

Isabella and Amy rolled up to the meeting spot. Isabella was a bit jittery, took a few deep breaths at the door, and said, "Alright, let's do this."

Amy reached out to push the door, but before she could even touch it, the private room door swung open from the inside.

A woman in a dress strutted out first. Seeing Amy and Isabella, Vilma raised an eyebrow, her smile dripping with sass. "You guys from Nina and Isabella Jewelry?"

Amy's face fell when she saw Vilma. "Ms. Hansen, what are you doing here?"

"I'm here to talk business." Vilma waved the contract in her hand, her grin getting even wider. "Looks like you're late to the party."

As she finished, two other women stepped out behind her.

Leading the pack was Victoria Hawkins, rocking a black and white business suit, looking sharp and about the same age as Esme. Trailing behind in a dark long dress was none other than Nathaniel's wife, Ophelia.

Victoria's eyes scanned Isabella and Amy. She said slowly, "Seems like your Ms. Miller is too busy to even sign a contract."

Her words were dripping with sarcasm.

Amy quickly jumped in, "I'm sorry, Ms. Hawkins, Ms. Miller is sick. She didn't mean to miss this. This is Ms. Miller's sister, Isabella; she's also a shareholder of Nina and Isabella Jewelry. She came here specifically to sign the contract with you today."

Victoria raised her hand to cut her off, "I don't need excuses. This whole mess shows me Nina and Isabella Jewelry's attitude and efficiency. That's enough for me. Tell Ms. Miller we've already signed with Harmony Jewelry. And for the future, we won't be considering Nina and Isabella Jewelry as a partner again. Goodbye."

"Ms. Hawkins," Isabella spoke up, "please believe in our sincerity. Nina really had an unexpected situation."

Victoria asked, "Isabella, you're not a businessperson, are you?"

Isabella was caught off guard.

Victoria chuckled lightly and continued, "Do you know what's most important in business?"

Isabella said, "I know, it's integrity."

"No." Victoria shook her head. "It's time."

Victoria said, "I really admire Nina's personality and her work. This time, I gave more time than usual as an exception. If you had come ten minutes earlier, everything would have been fine. Unfortunately, you're late."

Victoria glanced at her watch and said, "Sorry, we have a flight to catch."

With that, she walked away.

Vilma chuckled and turned to Ophelia. "Ophelia, I'll see Ms. Hawkins off."

"Okay." Ophelia nodded.

Isabella frowned; she hadn't expected Vilma to be connected to Ophelia.

Amy was stunned for a moment and then chased after Victoria. "Ms. Hawkins, please hear me out."

Only Isabella and Ophelia were left standing there.

After a brief silence, Ophelia smiled and said, "Ms. Miller, we meet again."

This wasn't a greeting; it felt more like a challenge.

Isabella frowned. "I didn't expect to meet Mrs. Nelson under such circumstances."

Ophelia said, "I didn't know you even had the guts to cross Bruno?"

Isabella was slightly shocked. How did Ophelia know about the Black Family?

###chapter 377 Having Nothing at All

"Hey, you know Bruno?" Isabella asked, kinda hesitant.

Ophelia just shot her a look full of disdain, clearly not in the mood to spill any beans. Instead of answering, she snapped back, "How long you think Nina and Isabella Jewelry's gonna last? How long can Nina keep it together? If I were you, I'd sell it off cheap before it totally crashes. You clawed your way up from the bottom; I get it. Folks like you, once you get a shot, you hustle hard to climb the social ladder. You wanna rebrand yourself, ditch that lower-class image. But Ms. Miller, you know what's really important in life?"

Isabella stayed quiet. She didn't need to think twice to know Ophelia wasn't about to say anything nice.

Ophelia shook her head, smirking. "It's self-awareness! But sadly, neither you nor Nina get that you can't really break into high society. Relying on men won't cut it."

Isabella frowned, couldn't help but snap back, "Nina's originally a lady from the Jose family."

Ophelia scoffed, "The Jose family? If I remember right, they came from some small place too, didn't they? It's a joke."

Isabella knew whatever she said, Ophelia would just mock her.

"And you?" Isabella shot back, "From what I know, you've always been a slacker. Besides your decent background, haven't you been living off Nathaniel all these years?"

Ophelia laughed, full of scorn. "I'm not like you. Everything Nathaniel has is because of me; everything you have is from pleasing men. There's no comparison."

"Enough. Instead of wasting time yapping with me, you'd etter go back, check Nina and Isabella Jewelry's assets and selling them off cheap," Ophelia said, smoothing her hair as she walked away.

Isabella stood there for a moment. Amy came running back, looking downcast. "I couldn't stop Ms. Hawkins. It's really over this time."

Thinking of Ophelia's smug face, Isabella frowned and asked Amy, "Is it true if we don't secure this deal, the company's really in trouble?"

Amy nodded, looking serious. "Yeah. That whole Harmony Jewelry mess really screwed us over. Even though Esme later cleared things up, it still left a nasty mark on Nina and Isabella Jewelry. In design, being called a copycat is the worst. Once you're labeled, your future work's always under suspicion. Plus, Harmony Jewelry's been secretly messing with us, ruining a bunch of our deals. Nina worked hard to land Ms. Hawkins."

Isabella said, "Nina never told me about this stuff."

"Nina's been under a ton of pressure. We all see she genuinely wants the company to thrive. She never told anyone about the hurdles she faced," Amy sighed. "I really like the company's vibe and Nina. She always manages to encourage me, making me feel like I'm not so inadequate. My colleagues and I all want to keep the company going while Nina's away. But with things going south like this, I really don't know how heartbroken Nina will be when she gets back."

Isabella thought for a moment and patted Amy's shoulder. "We'll figure something out. There's gotta be a way."

Already freaked out by Nina vanishing, Isabella now felt totally swamped with all the extra drama hitting the company.

She spent the whole afternoon at the office, sifting through all the papers on Nina's desk, but she was still clueless.

Victoria had already jetted off on an afternoon flight, and the deal between Victoria and Harmony Jewelry was a done deal.

How the heck was she gonna win back this order? Isabella was seriously stressed.

Seb, who had snuck up behind her at some point, bent down and hugged her from behind. "What's on your mind? Sighing like that."

Feeling suffocated, Isabella spilled everything to him.

Seb pulled up a chair and sat next to her. "If it doesn't work out, I'll invest. How much do you need, a few million?"

"This isn't just about money." After a pause, Isabella suddenly remembered what Ophelia had said. "Besides, the Landon Group and Nina and Isabella Jewelry are in totally different leagues. I don't want people saying I'm just leaning on a guy to do business."

What Ophelia had said earlier was harsh, but it hit home.

Nina was the eldest daughter of the Jose family; after going back home, she had Richard.

But what about Isabella? Sure, she had Esme, a famous designer, as her mom, but besides Seb and Sweetie, she had nothing. In this light, she did seem like a leech, always relying on Seb. If they ever split, she'd be left with zilch.

Seb grabbed her hand, brought it to his lips, and kissed it. "Silly, what's mine is yours. We're getting married; no need to be so formal."

Isabella pushed him away. "That's not what I meant. I just feel..."

Halfway through her sentence, Isabella suddenly paused, then leaned closer to Seb, pressing her nose to his collar and sniffing.

"Perfume? And it's a woman's?" Isabella asked.

It wasn't that Isabella had a super sharp nose, but the scent was too obvious. And this perfume wasn't hers, nor could it be Seb's.

Isabella sniffed again. "Is it gardenia?"

"Is it?" Seb's confused look didn't seem fake. He pulled up his collar and sniffed. "I don't smell anything."

Seb thought for a moment and said, "It's very faint. Maybe it got on me from one of the assistants during a meeting."

Seb said it casually; Isabella listened casually.

In fact, besides the perfume, she often smelled a scent of aromatherapy on Seb's shirts.

Isabella had asked Marvin; he said that in psychological therapy, aromatherapy was often used for hypnosis.

The scent on Seb was very unique and rare, mixed with a faint medicinal smell. Isabella knew he had been disappearing frequently lately, and he must be secretly undergoing treatment.

Having come this far with Seb, she was committed to spending the rest of her life with him, so she would trust him and thought it might just be a coincidence.

Isabella said, "I'll be spending the next few days at Nina's company. No matter what, I have to do my best to get the collaboration back."

Seb didn't stop her or discourage her; he just asked, "Need my help?"

Isabella firmly shook her head.

Seb said, "Alright. If you need help, just holler."

###chapter 378 The Perfume Stinks

Isabella wasn't about to let Seb get mixed up in this mess, and it wasn't just 'cause of what Ophelia said.

Even if she had something to prove, Ophelia wasn't worth the effort. More importantly, Isabella didn't wanna drag Seb into her problems.

After all the rollercoaster rides the Landon Group had been on, it was finally getting its act together. Isabella saw Seb busting his butt day and night; if she couldn't help him, the least she could do was not add to his headaches.

Isabella figured the key still lay with Harmony Jewelry.

The next day, Isabella stumbled on a clue in the mountain of papers on Nina's desk.

"What's this?" Isabella yanked out a document.

Amy hustled over, took a peek, and said, "It's some niche perfume brand."

The document listed a bunch of perfumes, all from the same brand, complete with names and pics.

Nina's company was all about jewelry, so why the heck was there a document about perfume?

Isabella asked, "Why does Nina need these?"

Amy shrugged. "Beats me."

Isabella looked it over a few times, feeling something was off. She'd grown up around Nina and knew Nina hardly ever used perfume.

Back when Nina was with Charlie, he used to nag her, saying her status didn't call for perfume, 'cause she always smelled like cooking fumes from years of housework. Adding perfume on top of that would be a disaster.

Nina was so brainwashed by that mindset that she never used perfume.

After Charlie kicked the bucket, Nina went back to the Jose family and reclaimed her spot as the eldest daughter. Then Margaret reintroduced Nina to the finer things in life. Fancy clothes needed a fresh and pleasant perfume to complete the look.

Maybe it was an old habit; even though Margaret and others had given Nina loads of perfumes, she always stuck to one. And it was an international brand.

That's what Isabella couldn't wrap her head around. Nina's cabinet was already overflowing with high-end perfumes, so why was she digging into some obscure brand? Plus, she was all about jewelry design and never showed any interest in perfume.

Just looking at the pictures didn't give much away. Isabella thought that since Nina had kept this document, she must've been researching something. Maybe these dozen perfumes were the ones Nina had picked out from many, but she hadn't had time to dig deeper.

Isabella grabbed the paper and headed to the nearest mall. But after wandering around, she couldn't find the brand.

Just when Isabella was about to give up, Kelsey showed up.

Kelsey looked super pissed, her lips all pouty.

"Had a fight with Jack?" Isabella nailed it.

Kelsey took a deep breath and let it out hard, linking arms with Isabella. "Isabella, do you think Jack's an idiot? I went to Casino One the other day to ask Michael to help me get in touch with Richard; I don't know why, but Jack just blew up at me."

Kelsey had been stewing for days, resisting the urge to find Jack, hoping he'd come to her first. But days had passed, and Jack hadn't called, texted, or shown up.

Kelsey couldn't keep it bottled up anymore but didn't wanna stoop low, so she came to Isabella to blow off some steam.

Isabella listened quietly and then asked, "You sure you didn't do anything?"

Kelsey was at a loss for words.

"I'm sure." Kelsey felt a bit guilty but also justified. "Michael, that jerk, just put his arm around my waist for a second. Jack saw it and went off on Michael, then got mad at me. But I don't get it. Michael's always been like that; it's not the first time Jack's seen it. I didn't do anything wrong, so why's Jack mad at me?"

The more Kelsey talked, the more upset she got. "No one in my family has ever fought with me. Whether it was my fault or not, my parents and Zaire would always come to comfort me. But Jack actually expects me to comfort him?"

Isabella kept listening quietly and then asked, "If you went to find Jack now and saw him hugging another girl, would you be upset?"

Kelsey jumped up. "Of course! If he dares to hold another woman, I'll break up with him!"

Kelsey spoke with such confidence, like she could dump Jack in a heartbeat. But Isabella knew Kelsey couldn't do it.

If Kelsey could be that decisive, she wouldn't have gotten so tangled up in the first place. Love's a real head-scratcher sometimes.

Isabella smiled and kept quiet.

Kelsey probably realized she was in the wrong. After venting, she calmed down a bit, her voice softening. "It was my fault. I knew he was busy and coming home late every day, so I didn't tell him when I went to Casino One to see Michael. If he had come with me in the first place, this wouldn't have happened."

Isabella nodded. "Looks like you've figured it out; you don't need me to play therapist anymore."

Kelsey pouted and then noticed the document in Isabella's hand. "Isn't that the Teef Perfume series?"

Isabella's eyes lit up. "Have you tried it before?"

Kelsey shook her head. "I haven't, but a college friend of mine did. This series is famous for its bad smell."

"Bad smell?" Isabella was shocked by the term.

It was her first time hearing that a perfume could smell bad.

"If a perfume smells bad, can it still be called a perfume?" Isabella asked.

Kelsey explained seriously, "First of all, it is a perfume. If you smell it alone, it's not bad. For most people, it wouldn't be too strong. But..."

Isabella pressed, "But what?"

Kelsey said, "But there's a group of people who can't use this perfume."

Isabella asked, "What kind of people?"

Kelsey said, "People with body odor."

Isabella felt the more Kelsey explained, the less she understood.

Kelsey said, "My college friend had body odor but couldn't smell it herself. So when she used this perfume, she only smelled the perfume. But anyone near her would suffer. It's not exactly a bad smell; it was just indescribable. I can still remember it, and it makes me a bit nauseous."

Isabella's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

For some reason, Kelsey's explanation reminded Isabella of the strange smell she noticed when talking to Ophelia yesterday. Just as Kelsey described, it wasn't a bad smell, just an indescribable one. Could Nina's perfume document be related to this?

###chapter 379 This Isn't for You

Kelsey's words just made Isabella even more sure that the perfume info Nina left behind wasn't some random thing. Nina must've been digging into something before everything went down!

"Where can you even buy these perfumes? I've hit up a bunch of malls and came up empty," Isabella said. She figured she needed to see the stuff in person first.

Kelsey replied, "That cheap junk? No mall would touch it. But yeah, this brand did have a counter in a mall when it first launched. My friend got suckered there and bought a bunch of nasty-smelling stuff. The products were so bad. A few months later, it was gone. Now, you can only find this perfume online."

Kelsey had a ton of shopping apps on her phone. She scrolled through all the popular ones but couldn't find the brand. Finally, she spotted it on some obscure app, but the sales were super low.

"Looks like they're going under. Probably selling old stock from years ago," Kelsey said, opening the details page and handing her phone to Isabella. "Is this the one?"

Isabella glanced at the info and said, "Yep, that's it."

She jotted down the app's name and placed an order herself. She bought a bottle of each of the dozen or so scents listed.

Kelsey watched in disbelief. "Isabella, are you sure you wanna buy so many? I told you it's nasty."

Isabella smiled. This wasn't something she could explain in a few words, and she wasn't even sure if these perfumes had anything to do with Ophelia.

"I'm just curious," Isabella said.

Kelsey shook her head. "You'll regret it."

As they chatted, they headed towards the escalator. Just as they got on, Isabella spotted someone she knew.

"Jack!" Isabella called out, and Kelsey quickly turned around.

Two escalators, one going up and the other down, and her eyes locked with Jack's.

Kelsey remembered she was still in a cold war with Jack and looked away first, waiting for him to call her.

Jack was about to speak, but just as he was about to, Kelsey turned her face away, looking like she didn't want to talk to him. In that moment of hesitation, they passed each other.

Kelsey waited for a long time, but Jack never called her. She couldn't help but look back, but the escalator was already empty, and Jack was nowhere to be seen.

"Jerk!" Kelsey cursed, feeling a pang of sadness.

She didn't want to be in a cold war or argue. She really liked Jack and enjoyed being with him.

Kelsey had long stopped being mad, but she couldn't bring herself to make the first move. She was waiting for Jack to give her an out.

"Kelsey?" Isabella noticed her mood and said, "I think Jack wanted to call you just now."

"Really?" Kelsey, teary-eyed, felt even more conflicted. "But he didn't call in the end!"

Isabella said, "Maybe he was afraid of being embarrassed. There were a lot of people just now, and he was afraid you'd ignore him if he called."

Kelsey said, "How could I ignore him? As long as he speaks, no matter the time or place, no matter how many people, I would respond to him!"

Kelsey indeed loved purely. Despite her temper, she was quite adorable.

Isabella couldn't stand seeing Kelsey all torn up and gave her a pat on the shoulder. "How about I call him?"

Isabella had just pulled out her phone when Kelsey grabbed her arm. "No!"

Kelsey bit her lip. "Forget it! If someone's gotta make the first move, it might as well be me."

Kelsey bit her lip again and said to Isabella, "Isabella, I'm gonna go find him."

Isabella was touched, but she still thought Kelsey should play it a bit cool, even if Jack was a good guy and Kelsey was really into him.

Isabella figured Jack would come around once he was done with his stuff. But before she could say anything, Kelsey had already taken off.

The escalator was moving too slow for Kelsey. She started running up the steps and disappeared at the top in no time.

Kelsey circled the mall a few times but couldn't spot Jack.

"Where is he?" She was exhausted, standing to the side with her hands on her hips, catching her breath.

Just then, Jack walked out of a jewelry store across the way.

Kelsey saw Jack and wanted to call out, but she held back and ran after him.

Jack was walking fast; it wasn't until he reached the elevator that Kelsey caught up.

She grabbed Jack's arm from behind, panting heavily, unable to speak.

"Kelsey." Jack stopped and helped her sit on a nearby bench.

Kelsey caught her breath and smiled. "Jack, why were you walking so fast? You didn't wait for me."

Jack pursed his lips. "I didn't know you were behind me."

Thinking of Jack's hurried steps, Kelsey asked, "Were you planning to come find me?"

"Yeah." Jack nodded. "I was heading to the Jose family to find you."

With that, Kelsey immediately felt better. She tightly held his hand, her fingers touching a velvet ribbon. She looked down and saw a small bag in Jack's hand.

"Did you buy jewelry?" Kelsey was a bit excited.

Kelsey thought, 'It must be for me.'

Jack looked down. "Yeah."

Kelsey's smile was hard to contain. "Since you bought it, give it to me. I saw it anyway, no need for surprises."

She didn't expect Jack to finally know how to please her by buying jewelry. She had mentioned wanting a bracelet recently, and Jack must have remembered. She wondered if Jack bought the style she liked.

But then Kelsey thought, 'As long as Jack bought it, it's thoughtful. I'll like it.'

Jack didn't respond.

Kelsey extended her hand, her delicate wrist in front of Jack. "Don't say I didn't give you a chance."

She thought, 'As long as Jack takes out the bracelet and puts it on me, I'll hug him and kiss him twice, no, three times!'

Jack looked at her expectant face and paused. "Sorry."

Kelsey's face froze. "What's wrong? There's no one around; are you embarrassed?"

She was already thick-skinned; what was Jack embarrassed about?

"Kelsey, what do you like? I'll buy it for you when I get paid next month." Jack's words instantly made Kelsey's enthusiasm vanish.

"What do you mean, next month?" Kelsey blinked, her innocent eyes staring at Jack, making him unable to lift his head.

Jack nervously squeezed the velvet ribbon in his hand, his voice muffled. "This isn't for you."

Kelsey's expression froze. "Not for me?"

###chapter 380  She Said Break Up, He Said Okay

Kelsey couldn't think of anyone else Jack would buy jewelry for besides her.

And from the look on Jack's face, it was clear he bought it himself, not something Seb put him up to.

Jack squeezed her hand, eyes cautious. "I promise, I'll get it for you next month."

Kelsey didn't react. With all these emotional ups and downs, it was hard to calm down so fast. One second, she was thrilled about the gift, and the next, reality smacked her in the face.

Kelsey suddenly thought of someone.

Her eyelashes fluttered. "Is this for Nancy?"

Besides Nancy, Kelsey couldn't think of anyone else.

Jack paused for a second.

In that second, Kelsey felt she had guessed right.

She was instantly furious. Kelsey yanked her hand out of Jack's, stood up, and stormed towards the elevator.

"Kelsey." Jack chased after her.

When he grabbed her arm, Kelsey hesitated but couldn't bring herself to shake him off.

There were too many people around; Jack clearly didn't want to talk here, so he pulled Kelsey into a coffee shop.

After ordering two coffees, Jack finally said, "This jewelry is for an elder, Kelsey. Don't get it twisted."

An elder? Jack was an orphan; after his family had an accident, Nancy's family took him in. Kelsey knew all this.

Jack opened the gift box, revealing a gold bracelet. "Barbara's birthday is coming up; Nancy mentioned Barbara always wanted a gold bracelet. So I bought it."

The style was definitely something an elder would wear; Jack had specifically bought a solid one, showing his genuine intentions towards Barbara.

Kelsey felt a bit better but still uneasy. "Is your monthly salary really that low? This bracelet is only ten grand."

If he wanted to buy her jewelry, with Jack's salary, it would definitely be more than enough.

Jack asked, "Can it wait until next month?"

"No, I want it now!" Kelsey didn't know why she was being so stubborn; she just felt that in Jack's heart, she wasn't as important as the Wilson family.

Kelsey had worked at the Landon Group for a while, so she knew a bit about Jack's salary.

Jack's fixed monthly salary was fifty grand, and sometimes he could get a bonus of twenty to thirty grand if the project was great. And these bonuses weren't included in the year-end bonus.

Kelsey did some quick math and knew that Jack's annual salary at the Landon Group was about a million bucks.

What Kelsey wanted wasn't very expensive; she just wanted a hundred-thousand-dollar bracelet. For Jack, it wasn't a big deal.

Jack frowned and said, "I can't swing it this month. If you can wait, I'll definitely buy it for you next month."

Kelsey exploded. "Then why can't Barbara wait?"

"Kelsey!" Jack's eyes also got serious. "That's a different matter."

Kelsey shouted, "Jack, I'm your girlfriend. I'm dating you with the intention of getting married. You're actually treating me like an outsider!"

Jack frowned and said nothing.

Kelsey was almost laughing out of anger. "I want the bracelet today! If you buy it for me, we'll make up."

Kelsey was dead set; she wanted more than just a bracelet. She wanted Jack's favoritism and affirmation. She knew Jack wouldn't turn her down because she was already so pissed off!

She had given him an out; if Jack had any sense, he'd take it. But all she got was a long, awkward silence.

Kelsey stared at Jack. As the seconds ticked by, her initial confidence started to wane. She felt like Jack might actually say no!

And sure enough, after what felt like forever, Jack finally spoke, "Sorry, I can't buy it for you today."

He said it so seriously, so firmly. It was like all of Kelsey's dignity was being stomped into the ground.

At that moment, Kelsey suddenly felt utterly disrespected.

"Then let's break up," Kelsey said weakly.

Jack's eyes flickered a couple of times, and he slowly nodded. "Okay."

Kelsey was suddenly at a loss. Her throat felt like it was stuffed with cotton, making it hard to breathe.

Jack, sitting across from her, always had that calm expression.

She said break up, and he said okay. Jack didn't even try to persuade her to stay.

Kelsey suddenly recalled that during their time together, Jack had repeatedly refused to live with her or let her stay overnight. He even refused to sleep with her.

She was serious. And obviously, Jack was just going through the motions. From the beginning, Jack hadn't really been into the relationship and had no intention of doing so.

Kelsey's nose tingled, and she almost cried.

They sat quietly for a while, neither of them speaking.

Kelsey finally couldn't sit still, grabbed her bag, and hurried out of the store.

Isabella had just arrived at the Jose family when Kelsey came back.

Kelsey entered the house crying. Even when Isabella called her, Kelsey didn't stop and ran upstairs. The door slammed shut.

Isabella and Margaret exchanged a glance.

Margaret frowned. "I've noticed that ever since she got together with Jack, she's been acting strange. She throws tantrums every few days; her temper is getting worse!"

Isabella patted Margaret's hand. "I'll go check on her."

Standing at Kelsey's door, Isabella was about to knock when she heard faint sobbing from inside.

Isabella was stunned and pushed the door open.

Kelsey was lying on the bed, her face buried in the bedding, crying.

Isabella had a bad feeling. "Kelsey, didn't you go to see Jack?"

No matter how she asked, Kelsey just remained silent; she just cried.

Seeing this, Isabella had no choice but to leave the room and call Jack.

When the call connected, Isabella asked, "Jack, what's going on with you and Kelsey? She's been crying for almost ten minutes."

Jack was silent for a few seconds, then he said, "We broke up."

Isabella was stunned. "Broke up, why?"

Before Jack could answer, a female voice interrupted, "Jack, are you ready? We need to go."

Isabella immediately frowned. "Jack."

Jack said, "That's it. Please take care of her. I'm not good enough for her."

Isabella said, "But-"

The call was disconnected.

Isabella turned around and saw that the door had somehow opened; Kelsey was standing there, tears streaming down her face.

###chapter 381 The Beautiful Day Would Eventually Come

Seb had to pull a late one at work, so Isabella grabbed dinner at the Jose family's crib before heading back.

She was totally swamped and couldn't really look after Sweetie. Margaret told her to chill and focus on her company stuff, promising she'd handle Sweetie.

After dinner, Isabella scooped up Sweetie and took advantage of her being all awake and full of beans to play a bit longer.

Sweetie was a real trooper. At just over three months, she already knew how to react to grown-ups' playful antics. When Sweetie looked at Isabella with those big, bright eyes, she'd giggle.

Sweetie's laughter was like a refreshing breeze, warming Isabella's heart. In that moment, Isabella was totally lost in her time with Sweetie.

At the Jose family's place, Sweetie was the star of the show. Not only did Margaret take great care of her, but Kelsey would often take Sweetie out for strolls. When Steven got home, he'd wash up and hold Sweetie.

Zaire wasn't into kids, but he'd still buy gifts for Sweetie. Isabella had seen the nursery, packed with everything from teething toys to Barbie dolls and toy cars. The gifts were practically spilling over. The Jose family really treated Sweetie like one of their own.

"Sweetie, you've put on some pounds again," Isabella teased with a grin, lifting Sweetie up. "Looks like Margaret's spoiling you."

Sweetie couldn't talk or get what she was saying, but she just giggled.

Isabella glanced over at Margaret, who was crashed on the opposite sofa. Margaret was leaning back, eyes half-closed, totally zonked out.

The faint dark circles under Margaret's eyes showed she hadn't been getting much rest lately. Taking care of Sweetie was already exhausting, and with Nina's sudden drama, Margaret must've been having a rough time.

If Margaret found out about Kelsey and Jack's fling, it would just add to her stress.

Isabella made up her mind to ask Seb about Jack's deal when she got back.

Because of this, Isabella didn't crash after getting home. She went through the documents she brought back from the office while waiting for Seb to return.

Suddenly, a cool breeze blew in from the window. Isabella instinctively turned her head and saw a cat perched on the windowsill.

Its was Cheese. Cute name, right? Made you think of soft, yummy cheesecake. But Isabella had a lingering fear of this cat, especially after it bit her last time.

Cheese suddenly meowed at Isabella.

Isabella shivered, her hair standing on end. She got up and quickly walked to the window, shooing the cat off the sill, then closed the window with a snap. She also drew the curtains before letting out a sigh of relief.

The cat didn't leave right away after being shooed off. It hung around below the windowsill, meowing now and then, like it was reminding her it was still there.

Even though the room was lit, Isabella still felt a bit creeped out.

Isabella grabbed her phone and dialed Seb. "Hey, Seb, when you getting back?"

"I'm already at the door. What's up?" Seb replied.

As he finished talking, she heard a car engine in the yard.

Isabella let out a sigh of relief. "Nothing, just checking."

She hung up, closed the documents, and went to open the door. But she only saw Seb walking alone, the car still parked outside.

"Where's Jack?" Isabella asked.

Seb paused. "He took some time off. Why?"

"Time off?" Isabella frowned. "Something happen to him?"

"Nope. Said an elder in his family was having a birthday, so he needed to go back home. Asked for three days off, plus his vacation days, so he's gone for a week."

"Got it." Isabella mused.

"What's up?" Seb changed his shoes, walked over, and took her hand as they headed to the living room. "Need something from him?"

Isabella filled him in about Kelsey.

Seb said, "Want me to call and check? But I usually don't meddle in my employees' personal stuff, especially love life drama."

Isabella thought Seb had a point. Better to talk face-to-face. Couples argue; it's normal. With Jack back home, both he and Kelsey could cool off. Maybe by the time Jack returned, they'd have patched things up.

Isabella said, "Forget it; we'll talk when he gets back."

"Okay." Seb responded softly, then he brushed a strand of her hair behind her ear, his fingertips grazing her earlobe. "Did you have dinner at the Jose family's place?"

"Yeah." Isabella knew what he was getting at and said, "I was gonna bring Sweetie back, but something came up at Nina's company, and I need to handle it over the next few days. Margaret said she couldn't bear to part with Sweetie and knew I was busy, so she told me to wait until Nina comes back to bring Sweetie home."

Isabella continued, "Margaret really takes great care of Sweetie. You know, Sweetie looks so cute now; she's all chubby and adorable."

Isabella said, "Honestly, seeing how Margaret and the others treat us, I feel really touched. Apart from Nina, they are the only ones who have made me feel the warmth of a family. It makes me realize how happy it is to have a loving family."

Isabella was starved for love. She craved it more than anyone. That's why she easily forgave Esme.

Esme was good to Isabella and Sweetie, but for some reason, compared to Margaret, something always felt off.

Seb lowered his head and kissed the back of her hand. "Bella, once the wedding's over, everything will get better. Besides the Jose family, Sweetie and I will always be with you."

"Okay." Isabella nodded.

She could sense Seb's fatigue and understand his thoughts.

Isabella knew Seb was undergoing treatment, so she didn't call him out. She just patiently waited for him to recover. She believed that the beautiful day would eventually come.

###chapter 382  Very Adorable

Late night, hospital.

A shadowy figure slipped out of the elevator and got stopped by two beefy bodyguards. "Who the hell are you? You can't just waltz in here."

Before they could finish, Richard whipped off his hat and mask, showing a face that could scare the devil himself.

As long as he didn't crack a smile, Richard's mug screamed "don't mess with me." Dude had a face made for trouble.

The bodyguards froze, eyes wide with a flicker of fear. They knew who he was.

"I'm here to see Elodie," Richard said, cool as ice, not even trying to push past them. He just stood there, peeling off his gloves and brushing off some dust.

The bodyguards exchanged a look, and one of them bolted to report in.

The other one looked like he wanted to vanish into thin air.

A minute later, the first bodyguard rushed back, all respectful. "Richard, I'll take you there."

"No need." Richard slipped his gloves back on and marched forward.

The bodyguards just stared at each other, too scared to follow.

Richard got to the ward, stopped, and knocked.

The door swung open; Quentin stood there. He didn't even flinch at seeing Richard and stepped aside. "Come in."

Richard walked in and saw Elodie lying on the bed.

"She just fell asleep," Quentin whispered. "She was pretty worked up."

Richard glanced at Elodie's legs, then took a couple steps closer to get a better look.

Quentin said, "It's high-level paraplegia. We've got the best medical team flying in. Surgery's tomorrow."

Richard didn't turn around, just asked, "What's the success rate?"

Quentin sighed, "Twenty percent."

Twenty percent? Richard's brow furrowed. That was practically no chance!

Richard turned to Quentin, "Where's Bruno? I need to see him."

Quentin shook his head. "Bruno said he won't see you before Elodie's surgery."

Richard's jaw tightened.

Quentin went on, "Bruno also wanted me to tell you, no matter how the surgery goes, he won't let Nina off the hook."

Richard's eyes flashed cold. "What do you mean?"

Quentin sighed. "Richard, you've been with the Black Family longer than I have. You know Bruno's temper. After Lova's accident, Elodie's his only kid. Now that she's like this, you think he can just let it go?"

Richard said, "I know Nina. She wouldn't push someone down the stairs. There's gotta be some mistake."

Quentin said, "Even if there is, Richard, you think Bruno's gonna listen to reason right now?"

Quentin stepped closer. "Don't worry. I'll look after Nina. For now, it's all riding on Elodie's surgery tomorrow."

Richard knew sticking around was pointless. "I'll be back tomorrow."

"Okay." Quentin didn't stop him and saw him out.

Back at Casino One, Richard called Michael over. "Go to the Jose family."

Michael asked, "Now?"

"Yeah." Richard sat in the chair, window wide open, but the room still reeked of smoke.

Michael sniffed but kept quiet.

Since Richard and Nina got together, Richard had quit smoking. Tonight, he was puffing away again, probably 'cause of the mess with Elodie.

Michael asked, "Richard, what do you need me to do?"

Richard said, "Go to the Jose family and let them know I'm back and Nina's safe. In a few days, I'll bring her back, no harm done."

He paused, looked up, and added, "And tell them to stay away from Casino One and not to call me. If anything comes up, you'll handle it."

The Black Family had a long reach, and Richard didn't want the Jose family getting caught in the crossfire.

Michael nodded. "Got it. I'll head over now."

At this hour, the Jose family was probably knocked out.

Michael was about to knock when the door swung open.

Kelsey opened the door and saw someone standing there. Before she could make out who it was, she started freaking out.

Before she could scream, Michael clamped a hand over her mouth.

Her teeth grazed his hand, leaving a bit of spit.

Michael wiped the sticky spot and said, "It's me."

The moment he covered her mouth, Kelsey realized it was him. Her heart was still racing, and she hadn't fully calmed down.

The moonlight hit Kelsey's face, her eyes wide, lips slightly parted, looking all panicked and delicate.

Michael gritted his teeth and grinned. "Where you headed in the middle of the night?"

Kelsey finally got a grip, ignored his question, and stared at him like she'd seen a ghost. "Michael?"

"Yeah." Michael nodded, looking at her. "It's me."

"What are you doing here?" Kelsey asked, wary. "It's so late. You here to rob us?"

Michael laughed. "Don't you think you look more like a thief?"

Kelsey glanced down at her somewhat disheveled appearance.

She wasn't in the mood to argue and asked, "Who are you looking for?"

Michael said, "The Jose family."

Kelsey said, "There are five of us. Who exactly?"

Michael shrugged. "Doesn't matter. As long as their last name is Jose."

Kelsey was speechless. "What's up? Just spit it out."

Michael said, "Richard sent me."

Kelsey immediately fired off, "Has Richard found Nina? How is she? Where is she? Is she with Richard? Is she hurt? Where's she been? Was Bruno holding her?"

Michael chuckled. "You got too many questions. Richard said he'd bring Nina back, but not today. It's a bit complicated, and he's working on it. You need to stay calm. Best not to go to Casino One or call him right now."

Kelsey frowned. Things were a mess, and they had to rely on Richard. Only he could get Nina out.

"I've delivered the message. I'll leave you be." Michael turned to go.

Seeing him already walking down the last step, Kelsey rushed out and followed.

Michael heard the rustling footsteps behind him, paused, and looked back, his questioning gaze landing on Kelsey's face.

Kelsey bit her lip and said, "I want to find Jack. Can you take me?"

Michael raised an eyebrow, his gaze sweeping over Kelsey again.

Michael asked, "In the middle of the night, dressed like that?"

Kelsey said, "What's wrong with this? It's loungewear, not pajamas."

As she spoke, Michael's gaze dropped to her feet.

Kelsey was still wearing her house slippers, with fluffy surfaces and ten delicate, alabaster toes peeking out.

Being stared at by Michael, Kelsey immediately felt nervous; she instinctively pulled her feet back and curled her toes tightly.

She was very adorable! Michael suddenly took a step closer; Kelsey quickly stepped back, one foot slipping, and her clean foot landed on the lawn.

###chapter 383 Keeping Distance

"My shoe!" Kelsey yelped, trying to grab it.

But Michael was faster. He stepped on Kelsey's slipper with the tip of his shoe, trapping her foot on top of his.

Michael's leather shoes were hard and cold.

Kelsey was only worried about her shoe and got a bit angry. "Michael, you're stepping on my shoe!"

Kelsey loved solid colors, especially white. Her loungewear and slippers were mostly white. This pair of slippers, with their fluffy bunny ears, was a gift from Jack just last week. Kelsey adored them.

But now, one of the bunny ears was getting squished under Michael's foot. The soles were so dirty, what a shame for her pure white slippers!

Michael sneered. "You stepped on my foot."

Kelsey rolled her eyes, thinking, 'If you hadn't stepped on my shoe first, would I have stepped on your foot? Do you think I enjoy doing that?'

Kelsey grumbled inwardly but held back because she might need to ask Michael for a ride later.

Kelsey steadied herself and quietly lifted her foot off Michael's shoe.

Michael smirked and moved his foot away. He squatted down, picked up Kelsey's slipper, and dusted it off with his other hand. Then he reached out to hold her ankle.

Startled, Kelsey pulled back. "What are you doing?"

Michael didn't answer or look up. He continued to reach out, grasping her slender ankle.

Kelsey felt the heat from Michael's palm. Just as she was about to pull her foot back, Michael had already wiped the dust off the soles of her feet with his hand, then slipped the slipper onto her foot and gently placed it back on the ground.

For some reason, Michael's actions had a carefulness that made Kelsey feel like she was being treated like a treasure in his hands.

Michael stood up. "Shall I call a cab for you?"

As he spoke, he took out his phone to call a cab.

Kelsey quickly blocked his phone screen with her hand. "No! If I wanted to call a cab, I would have done it myself."

She spoke in a low voice, glancing towards her house at times as if she were a thief.

Michael smirked. "So you like to sneak around?"

Kelsey rolled her eyes at him. "What nonsense are you talking about? I just don't want my parents and Zaire to worry about me. I'll handle my own problems; they've got enough on their plate already. Besides, it's hard to get a cab at this hour and in this area. I was going to drive, but I didn't want to wake them up. Michael, since you're heading back anyway, can you give me a ride? If it's too much trouble, I can pay you."

"No need, I don't need your money." Michael took out a black car key from his pocket. "Let's go; my car is parked a bit far."

Seeing Michael agree, Kelsey breathed a sigh of relief.

She followed Michael for about a hundred feet and then saw his vehicle, stunned.

Kelsey asked, "You came on a motorcycle?"

Michael had already reached the bike and handed her a helmet. "What, getting cold feet?"

Kelsey bit her lip and took the helmet. "No way. Let's go."

It was just her first time on a motorcycle.

She put on the helmet; Michael, already on the bike, wearing black leather gloves, patted the seat behind him. "Hop on."

Kelsey looked at the small remaining space on the seat, feeling hesitant.

Although she had never ridden a motorcycle, she had seen others on the road. The guy carried the girl, who clung to his back; such a posture was undeniably intimate. Knowing Michael's mischievous nature, getting on his motorcycle seemed like playing with fire.

Seeing Kelsey hesitate, Michael laughed. "What, scared?"

Kelsey didn't respond. Indeed, she was scared. She was afraid that once she got on, she wouldn't be able to get off.

Michael adjusted the dashboard without looking at her. "You can still change your mind."

Kelsey thought for a moment. "I'll call a cab."

Michael didn't say anything, continuing to fiddle with the dashboard.

Since she wasn't taking his ride, she had to return the helmet. But for some reason, Kelsey couldn't undo the buckle. She was almost sweating, but the buckle wouldn't budge.

With no other option, Kelsey asked Michael for help, "Can you help me? I can't seem to undo it."

Michael glanced at her. "You locked the buckle."

Kelsey didn't understand; she felt uneasy. "What now? Do you have a key?"

Michael chuckled but patiently explained, "This kind of buckle is complicated. There's no key; you have to go to a shop and have it unlocked by a professional."

Kelsey looked at him suspiciously. "Really? You're not tricking me, are you?"

Kelsey knew nothing about motorcycles or these advanced gadgets. She had to take Michael's word for it.

Michael didn't argue with her; he took out his phone and made a call, putting it on speaker.

The call was quickly answered by a man's voice, "Hey Michael, what's up so late?"

Michael said, "I need to know how to unlock a helmet buckle that's stuck."

"Stuck?" The voice sounded surprised.

"Yeah." Michael glanced at Kelsey, repeating seriously, "Stuck."

There was a long silence before the voice came through. "You have to come to my shop. I'll use tools to unlock it. But Michael, you are already an experienced rider; how did you get a helmet buckle stuck?"

Kelsey's cheeks burned with embarrassment. How humiliating.

The thought of showing up at the shop with the helmet on and facing ridicule made Kelsey want to crawl under a rock.

Michael didn't explain much, just said, "A mistake."

The other side said, "Are you coming over? I'm at the shop; I'll wait for you."

Michael looked at Kelsey, seeking her opinion.

Kelsey thought she couldn't go see Jack with the helmet on, so she nodded.

Michael smiled and told the person on the phone, "Wait for us."

He hung up and placed his hands on the handlebars, looking at Kelsey. He was waiting for her to get on.

Kelsey knew this wasn't the time to be coy. She could just keep her distance once on the bike.

With that thought, Kelsey reluctantly got on the bike.

###chapter 384 Hold On!

She balled up her fists, crossed 'em in front of her, and leaned back a bit, trying to dodge Michael.

Michael wasn't having it. "You looking to start something?"

Kelsey shook her head. "Nope."

Michael pointed to his waist. "Hold on."

"No way!" Kelsey's eyes went wide, like, did she hear that right? How could Michael even say that?

Kelsey stressed, "Michael, I got a boyfriend."

But Michael cut her off, "This is how you ride; it's not like we're in bed. Why you acting all shy?"

Kelsey rolled her eyes at the back of his head. Shy? She was just stating facts.

Michael asked, "You gonna hold on or what?"

Kelsey turned her head away, staying silent.

Michael didn't push it. He twisted the throttle, and as the bike shot forward, Kelsey leaned back from the force. Freaked out, she grabbed Michael's jacket.

Before she could catch her breath, he hit the brakes hard.

Kelsey got thrown forward, smacking into Michael's back.

Still rattled, Michael grabbed her hands and wrapped them around his waist.

He crossed her hands together, making her hold on tight.

Kelsey tried to pull back, but Michael snapped, "Hold on if you don't wanna die!"

Before she could say anything, he twisted the throttle again.

Once they left the villa area, Michael kept speeding up.

The wind was crazy, blowing away all of Kelsey's hesitation and awkwardness.

Scared out of her mind, she clung to Michael, her hands wrinkling his clothes.

Michael glanced down at her hands around his waist; he couldn't stop grinning. Kelsey was way more uptight than he thought.

Finally, the bike came to a stop.

The wind noise died down, and Kelsey started to come back to her senses.

"We're here," Michael called from the front.

Kelsey opened her eyes and saw they were at Jack's place.

She got off the bike, her legs all wobbly, still in a daze. "Didn't you say we were going to the shop to take off the helmet first?"

Michael sat on the bike, one foot on the ground, looking all smug. He took off his helmet and smirked. "Actually, your outfit's pretty unique. Might even surprise Jack."

Kelsey was speechless. She wanted to punch him. But she knew she couldn't take Michael. She let it go and silently cursed him out in her head.

Michael beckoned her with his finger, like calling a pet. "Come here."

Kelsey didn't budge.

Michael chuckled, got off the bike, and walked up to her.

As he got closer, Kelsey wanted to step back.

"Don't move!" Michael stood in front of her and reached out to unlock the buckle.

Kelsey had a bad feeling.

Sure enough, she heard a click, and the strap around her neck loosened.

Michael met her eyes and grinned. "Just remembered, I can unlock it."

Kelsey was speechless. Clearly, Michael had played her.

Michael took off her helmet and said, "Go find your boyfriend already."

Kelsey clenched her fists and suddenly aimed a kick at Michael's crotch.

Michael's eyes flashed, and he caught her ankle with precision.

Not only did Kelsey miss her target, but now she was stuck. She stood there on one foot, the other hanging in the air, looking totally awkward.

Michael's grip was firm but not too tight, making it impossible for Kelsey to break free. She had to stay in that ridiculous pose.

Michael smirked, "Heartless, using me and then tossing me aside?"

Kelsey's face turned red with anger. "Michael, you're messing with me!"

"Nope," Michael said, "I really forgot earlier. I remembered halfway, so I didn't take you to the shop and brought you straight here. How's that? Am I good or what?"

Kelsey wanted to slap him, but her arms were too short to reach.

She could only glare at him. "Michael, you're a jerk!"

Michael shrugged. "All guys are jerks, even your Jack."

Kelsey snapped, "Jack would never be like you!"

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Like me?"

"Yeah, you're shameless, a scoundrel, a rogue, frivolous, and unreliable!" Kelsey felt she could go on forever listing Michael's faults.

Michael listened and then grinned. "I always thought those were my best qualities."

Kelsey was speechless. She didn't want to argue with him anymore.

"Let go!" she demanded.

Michael looked at her flushed cheeks and watery eyes. "Call me your brother, and I'll let you go."

His grip tightened. "Say it!"

Michael suddenly got serious, no more smiles, his eyes sharp and intimidating.

With no one around and it being late at night, Kelsey was genuinely a bit scared of this side of Michael.

After hesitating, she said, "Michael, tonight was my fault. I shouldn't have provoked you. Let me go, and I won't bother you again."

Michael frowned. Those weren't the words he wanted to hear. Actually, he knew it was impossible for Kelsey to see him as her brother.

He just wanted Kelsey to show some softness, make his trip worthwhile.

But Kelsey refused to yield, even though her eyes showed some fear, she still stood her ground.

Michael let go, scoffing. "Boring."

Kelsey's foot hit the ground, and she staggered a bit.

Michael got back on the bike, put on his helmet, and twisted the throttle.

"Wait!" Kelsey called out urgently.

Michael didn't rush to leave but didn't look at her either.

Kelsey looked at him and said, "Michael, thanks for bringing me here."

Michael didn't respond and drove away.

Only when the sound of the motorcycle faded into the night did Kelsey turn to enter the building.

Pressing the familiar floor button, Kelsey leaned against the elevator, wondering what to say to Jack when she saw him.

She missed Jack a lot.

Kelsey could be very decisive with people she didn't like. But with those she liked, she was a total pushover.

She had been miserable at home all day and couldn't take it anymore. She thought if she apologized to Jack, he would probably forgive her, right?

Kelsey was nervous, pacing at the door for a long time before using the code to unlock it.

###chapter 385 What Do I Even Mean To You

The lights were on inside, but it was dead quiet.

A dude's coat was chillin' on the sofa; the bedroom door was half-cracked, with some muffled voices sneaking out.

Kelsey strolled over and nudged the door open. The voices got louder.

Nancy was like, "Jack, you got everything sorted at work?"

Jack was like, "Yeah."

Nancy went on, "Jack, I didn't tell Mom and Dad we're coming back. I wanna surprise 'em. Especially Mom, she's always yappin' about you. If she sees you outta the blue, she'll flip."

Nancy was perched on the edge of the bed, swinging her legs like a kid.

Jack was squatting nearby, stuffing a suitcase.

Nancy kept rambling; Jack tossed in a word here and there. The vibe was chill until Kelsey barged in. Nancy froze, then jumped up, looking all flustered. "Ms. Jose?"

Jack's back went stiff for a sec, then he turned and locked eyes with Kelsey.

The room got tense, and nobody said a word.

Kelsey and Jack were having a stare-down, with Nancy stuck in the middle, glancing back and forth.

After a beat, Nancy piped up, "Ms. Jose, don't get the wrong idea. I'm just crashing here tonight; I don't usually stay over."

Kelsey shot her a look. "Stirring up drama is your thing, huh?"

Nancy was speechless. She gave Jack a pleading look, hoping he'd back her up.

But since Kelsey showed up, Jack's eyes were glued to her; he couldn't stop staring.

Kelsey turned away. "Jack, I'll give you a shot to explain."

With that, Kelsey walked out of the bedroom.

With Nancy around, Kelsey couldn't even chill in the living room. She stepped outside, opened a window in the hallway, letting the night breeze cool her down.

She came to make peace, not to fight. Kelsey was ready to hear Jack out; if he explained, she'd believe him.

Jack came out and stood next to Kelsey. He started slow, "The day after tomorrow's Barbara's birthday. I planned to go back with Nancy to celebrate. I already took leave, and we're heading out tomorrow morning. Nancy lives far, so I let her crash here for convenience."

Jack explained, but Kelsey was still ticked.

She looked at Jack and asked, "Jack, what do I even mean to you?"

Jack didn't say a word. He fished something out of his pocket.

It was a black rectangular box with a fancy flower on it.

"The bracelet you wanted, I got it for you." Jack opened the box, showing off a sparkling bracelet. "I just don't know if it's too late."

"It's too late!" Kelsey huffed, lifting her chin and turning away.

Jack was stunned for a sec, then he nodded. "I wasn't planning to return it or give it to anyone else. It's yours. Whether you toss it or keep it, up to you."

With that, Jack closed the box, set it on a nearby cabinet, and looked at Kelsey. "I'm leaving now."

When Jack turned to go inside, Kelsey almost laughed in frustration.

She stomped her foot and yelled, "Jack!"

Jack stopped.

Kelsey wiped her tears with her sleeve. "It's so late; you really gonna let me go back alone?"

Jack hesitated. "I'll grab the car keys."

He went back, got the keys, and grabbed a coat. When he came out, he saw Kelsey staring at the bracelet in the open box.

As soon as Jack showed up, Kelsey snapped the box shut. "The bracelet's nothing special, but I can give it to someone."

Jack's eyes darkened. "Yeah. It's yours; do whatever you want with it."

They rode the elevator down in silence.

Outside, a gust of night wind hit, and Kelsey, dressed lightly, felt a chill. She rubbed her arms.

Jack handed over his coat. "Put it on?"

Kelsey shot him a look and scoffed, "No."

But she shivered right after.

Jack frowned, stepped forward, and draped the coat over her shoulders.

Kelsey didn't resist, tugging at her lips, and followed him into the car.

As the car started, Kelsey suddenly said, "Jack, you're really heartless, you know that?"

Jack paused and instinctively glanced at her.

Kelsey leaned against the seat, her head tilted slightly towards Jack. A faint smile played on her lips, but her eyes were full of hurt. She had just been crying; her eyes were misty, and tears clung to her lashes. She looked like she might break any second.

Jack's chest tightened, a dull pain spreading. "I'm sorry, Kelsey."

"You should be," Kelsey said, "I like you so much I put my pride aside for you. But you, you don't even try to comfort me. Jack, sometimes I wonder, do you even like me?"

Kelsey thought, 'If you really like someone, shouldn't you be unable to control your longing, feeling sorry whenever you think of them?'

Jack was speechless, feeling like a real jerk. He wanted to apologize but couldn't get the words out.

Kelsey asked, "If I hadn't come to find you tonight, would you have ever come to find me?"

Jack's throat tightened.

Kelsey continued, "Jack, do you know how I spent today? I imagined a million times that you'd come find me. Every little noise in the yard, I'd run to the balcony, hoping it was you. In the morning, I thought you'd definitely come. After struggling through the morning, the afternoon felt endless. I sat by the window, staring at the empty yard, wondering what you were doing, if you thought of me. Even if you were delayed, would you call and say not to break up? By evening, it was dark, and you still hadn't come. No calls, no messages."

Kelsey lowered her eyes and gave a bitter smile. "I thought, I never want to see you again. Even if you showed up then, begging me not to break up, I wouldn't want you. But I couldn't sleep. I close my eyes and open them again, and your image lingers. Even when I slept, I dreamed of you. I think I really went crazy!"

###chapter 386 Would You be Willing to Come Back with Me?

"Shut up." Jack turned sideways, grabbed her wrist, and yanked Kelsey into his arms, holding her tight. "Just shut up, Kelsey..."

Jack was at his breaking point. Every word out of Kelsey's mouth felt like a dagger to his heart.

"It's all on me; I'm a total jerk. I'm sensitive and insecure. I regret everything and miss you like crazy, but I didn't even have the guts to call you." Jack held Kelsey, tears brimming in his eyes.

Kelsey leaned against his chest. "Jack, I came here today to ask you one thing. Do you like me or not?"

Jack nodded like a bobblehead. "I do. No, Kelsey, I love you."

Kelsey started crying too. "Jack, I really like you. I've never liked anyone this much in my life. Not even when I liked Seb before. Jack, can you promise me you won't make me sad again? I don't need anything else; I just need you to be a little braver and love me a little more, okay?"

Jack lowered his head and gently kissed her forehead. "Kelsey, I swear this will never happen again! From now on, I'll hold your hand tight and never let go."

Kelsey finally smiled, a mix of joy and lingering bitterness making her want to laugh and cry at the same time. She could only vent her emotions on Jack, pounding her fists against his shoulder.

Jack didn't resist, letting Kelsey hit him. Even though each punch landed on him, he laughed heartily.

After a moment, Kelsey calmed down.

Jack looked at Kelsey's slightly swollen eyes from crying and said, "Stop crying. Your eyes will hurt tomorrow if you keep this up."

Kelsey nodded. "Take me home. It's so late; don't you have to catch a train tomorrow?"

Jack started the car and drove forward. "Actually, I changed my mind."

Kelsey was stunned. "What do you mean?"

Jack said, "We're going to a hotel."

Kelsey blinked, feeling both excited and worried. "But what about tomorrow?"

"Don't worry. I won't be late." Jack reached over to touch Kelsey's hair, smiling as he drove out of the neighborhood.

As the car passed an intersection, a motorcycle flashed by outside the window.

Kelsey instinctively turned her head; she saw that everything was shrouded in darkness. Once the car drove further, she couldn't see anything clearly.

"What's wrong?" Jack asked.

"Nothing." Kelsey looked away. She thought she must have been seeing things. Michael had left long ago; how could he still be there?

The car passed the intersection and disappeared. About two minutes later, a motorcycle headlight suddenly lit up in the darkness.

Michael got on the bike, twisted the throttle, and turned around, heading in the opposite direction.

The hotel had the heat on, quickly dispelling the chill from Kelsey's body.

Kelsey had taken a shower at home before coming, so she didn't need to wash up again.

Once in the room, Kelsey wrapped herself in the blanket. Only when she felt a bit warm did she uncover herself and walk barefoot on the carpet to get some water.

Halfway through drinking, Jack came out of the bathroom. He had taken a shower and was wearing the hotel's bathrobe, the belt loosely tied, exuding an overwhelming sense of masculinity.

Hearing the footsteps, Kelsey turned around and looked at Jack, her eyes sparkling.

She was still holding the water cup but forgot to drink. She stared at Jack's open collar like a hungry predator.

Jack walked over, took the cup from Kelsey's hand, and placed it on the table. Then he bent down, picked Kelsey up horizontally, and placed her on the soft bed.

Kelsey took the chance to wrap her arms around his neck, pulling him into the bed with her.

Her eyes sparkled with anticipation. She'd been gearing up for this moment, so fear was the last thing on her mind.

Jack was struggling to keep it together, but he didn't want to let Kelsey down. Without a second thought, he lowered his head and kissed her.

They kissed like there was no tomorrow, the room filled with the sounds of their passion.

Then, out of nowhere, a phone rang, cutting through the moment.

At first, they ignored it. But the caller was relentless, ringing again after being sent to voicemail.

Jack reluctantly let go of Kelsey and reached for his phone.

He glanced at the screen but didn't answer right away. Instead, he asked Kelsey, "It's Nancy."

Kelsey raised an eyebrow. "Then answer it."

Jack hit the answer button and put it on speaker.

Nancy's voice came through. "Hey, Jack, where are you? Why aren't you back yet?"

Jack frowned. "What's up?"

Nancy said, "Nothing, just worried about you. It's late. When are you coming back? I'll wait up for you."

"No need," Jack said, "You should go to bed early. I'll be back in the morning."

With that, he hung up, set his phone to silent, and turned back to Kelsey.

Kelsey was like a lit match, burning with passion. But Jack only kissed her, not taking off any clothes or making any other moves.

Even when she tried to seduce him, Jack just held her hand and said, "Kelsey, it's not the right time yet."

Kelsey's eyes filled with tears, looking at him with a mix of frustration and sadness.

Jack held her fingers in his palm and said, "Just wait a little longer."

"How long do I have to wait?" Kelsey moved closer, rubbing against him through the thin fabric. She even teased, "Are you not capable?"

Jack blushed. Despite being a big shot at work, he was a rookie in bed.

Seeing this, Kelsey smiled slyly.

She wriggled out of Jack's arms, flipped over, and pinned him beneath her.

Kelsey straddled his waist, taking charge, and leaned on his chest. Her fingers slipped into Jack's collar, her smile seductive. "Jack, let's give it a try?"

Jack was overwhelmed by her teasing. He grabbed her waist and still said in a muffled voice, "No."

Kelsey continued to rub against him. "I want to. I heard it's really fun."

Jack was tormented by her, his face turning even redder. "Kelsey, be good."

Kelsey pouted, "No, I want it! I'm dating you with marriage in mind. I'll give it to you sooner or later. Unless you don't want to marry me, or you don't want me at all!"

Jack smiled helplessly, releasing his grip on her waist. He hugged her and said, "Kelsey, I just don't want to do anything that might hurt you before marriage."

Kelsey blinked. "Mr. Brown, I didn't expect you to be so old-fashioned."

Jack ran his fingers through her hair. "Until I'm absolutely sure, I don't want to take any risks with you."

Kelsey got what he meant.

She asked, "How long do I have to wait? Why don't we get married first thing tomorrow morning?"

Jack chuckled, patting her back. He didn't speak for a while, lost in thought. "Kelsey, would you be willing to go back with me?"

###chapter 387 Our Jack

Jack got nothing but the sound of Kelsey's steady breathing in response.

Next morning, Jack woke up to find Kelsey already awake, lying in his arms and tracing his face with her finger.

Her eyes were full of pure affection, making Jack's heart do a little dance. He couldn't resist and kissed her forehead. "Why are you up so early?"

Kelsey tilted her head and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. "Didn't you say you wanted me to go back with you? Did you get the tickets?"

Jack was caught off guard. "You heard that last night?"

Kelsey nodded. "Yeah, but I was too tired and knocked out."

Jack sat up and grabbed his phone. "I'll get the tickets right now."

"Cool," Kelsey said, tying up her hair. "I'll go freshen up."

Jack nodded. "Alright."

While Kelsey was in the bathroom, the doorbell rang.

Jack went to open the door, and Kelsey leaned against the bathroom door, toothpaste foam in her mouth, watching him.

Jack thought it was room service, but nope, it was Zaire.

"Mr. Jose?" Jack felt like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.

Zaire's face was all serious. "Jack, how dare you bring Kelsey to a hotel room?"

Jack didn't back down. "I'll treat Kelsey right, I promise."

"Of course," Zaire said, "Jack, we've known each other for years. If you mess with Kelsey, you'll regret it."

"Zaire!" Kelsey wiped the foam from her mouth and rushed over. "Stop scaring Jack. Did you bring what I asked for?"

Jack looked at Kelsey, surprised she had called Zaire.

Zaire frowned, clearly not happy with Kelsey's protective stance. "This is a man-to-man talk. Stay out of it."

"No way!" Kelsey clung to Jack's arm. "If I leave, how do I know you won't bully him?"

Zaire was fuming. "Bully him?"

Kelsey said, "Yes. Our Jack is very honest."

Zaire gritted his teeth. "Our Jack?"

"Oh, Zaire, just drop off the stuff and leave. Bye-bye." Kelsey grabbed the suitcase and pushed Zaire out.

Zaire was speechless.

Kelsey's suitcase was packed to the brim, not just with her stuff but also with gifts for Liam, Barbara, and even Nancy's brother.

Seeing her thoughtful preparations, Jack felt a pang of guilt and silently vowed to treat Kelsey even better.

After packing, Jack and Kelsey went to pick up Nancy and grabbed Jack's stuff along the way. Then the three of them headed to the station.

Since Jack and Nancy's tickets were bought together, their seats were next to each other.

Kelsey's ticket was a last-minute thing, so she wasn't with them and was several carriages away.

Before boarding, Kelsey turned to Nancy and said, "Hey, can we switch seats?"

Nancy glanced at Jack, who was busy with the luggage, and smirked. "Why should we?"

Kelsey replied, "Because I want to sit with Jack."

Nancy shot back, "Well, I want to sit with Jack too, Ms. Jose. You had him all night. Do you really need him all day too?"

With Jack out of earshot, Nancy dropped the nice act and went straight for Kelsey.

Kelsey wasn't fazed; she knew Nancy's true colors.

"Fine, I'll let Jack handle this," Kelsey said, not wanting to argue, and went to find him.

But when Jack and Kelsey came back, Nancy was already by the window, looking all pained and holding her stomach.

Jack asked, "What's wrong?"

Nancy looked up, wincing. "I think the breakfast messed me up. My stomach's killing me."

Jack asked, "Is it bad?"

Nancy shook her head. "No, I'll just sit here and look at the scenery. It should pass."

Translation: She wasn't giving up her seat.

Jack paused for a moment and said, "You rest here. I'll go to Kelsey's carriage and see if I can switch seats with someone."

"Jack," Nancy grabbed his hand, looking all pitiful. "Don't leave me alone. I'm scared."

Kelsey rolled her eyes, knowing Nancy was faking it just to get under her skin.

Kelsey let go of Jack's hand. "I'll wait for you over there."

Then she walked away.

The train started moving soon after.

Watching the platform fade away, Kelsey pressed her lips together, feeling unsure if Jack would leave the "sick" Nancy to come find her.

Kelsey didn't want to fight, but Nancy kept pushing her buttons, so she wasn't backing down.

The train picked up speed, and several minutes passed with no sign of Jack.

Kelsey sighed, thinking it wasn't worth getting worked up over.

"Excuse me, can I switch seats with you?" A familiar voice suddenly asked.

Kelsey turned around, surprised. It was Jack, politely asking the girl next to her to switch seats.

The girl agreed, and Jack sat down next to Kelsey.

As soon as he did, Kelsey hugged his arm and rested her head on his shoulder. "I thought you weren't coming."

Jack kissed her hair. "You wanted me here, so here I am."

Kelsey smiled, content. "What about Nancy? Aren't you worried about her?"

Jack said, "She's fine. Told her to call or text if anything happens. It's just a few carriages away. I'll be there in minutes if needed."

"Okay," Kelsey said, satisfied.

###chapter 388 A Ray of Hope

On the way, the two snapped a ton of pics. Landscapes, selfies, you name it.

Kelsey threw some up in the family group chat.

The Jose family chat used to just be the four of them. But after Nina got accepted into the fam, a few more folks joined. Besides Nina, there was Isabella and Seb. Richard wasn't into social media, so he wasn't in it.

Isabella saw the pics and hit up the group chat asking what was going on.

Kelsey told her she was on the road back to Jack's hometown with him.

Zaire threw in a big eye-roll emoji.

Margaret sent a voice message, "When you get to his place, be polite and mind your manners. Since you and Jack aren't engaged yet, it's best not to crash at their place. Find a decent hotel nearby and have Jack stay with you. Call us if anything comes up; don't go off on your own in a huff!"

Kelsey replied: [Got it, Mom.]

Steven had just wrapped up a morning meeting. Seeing the message, he immediately sent some cash.

Jack watched, a smile playing on his lips.

The Jose family vibe was really chill, no wonder Kelsey turned out so sunny and cheerful. This was exactly what Jack had always wanted growing up. His eyes showed a hint of envy.

Seeing this, Kelsey said, "How about I add you to the group too?"

Jack shook his head and smiled. "Let's hold off a bit. We'll wait until we're engaged and I've formally met Margaret and Steven."

Jack was all about doing things right and taking it step by step.

Kelsey respected that. "Okay."

Elodie's surgery took four hours.

Richard and Quentin waited outside the operating room the whole time.

When the doc came out, they immediately asked about Elodie's condition.

The doc threw out a bunch of medical jargon, but the bottom line was it failed.

Elodie's surgery was a bust. According to the doc, she'd never stand again.

Before the surgery, there was still a twenty percent chance. Now, even that was gone.

Richard's brow furrowed. He couldn't imagine what was next for him and Nina.

Quentin took a call, then came over and said to Richard, "Burno wants to see you."

In the swankiest hotel suite in the city.

Richard and Quentin walked in, immediately hit by the strong scent of blood.

A figure knelt on the carpet, head bowed, clothes soaked in blood. The smell was overpowering.

"Michael!" Richard's voice was heavy.

He should've seen this coming. Even if Bruno wouldn't touch him for now, he'd definitely take it out on someone. Michael, being Richard's closest guy, was the perfect target!

Michael slowly lifted his head, face battered and bruised, half of it swollen, with a nasty cut at the corner of his mouth, covered in a thick scab, looking like a hideous centipede.

Michael said, "I'm fine, Richard."

Richard frowned deeply and turned to look at Bruno, who was calmly sipping tea by the floor-to-ceiling window.

Without a word, Richard dropped to his knees with a thud.

Quentin walked over, bent down, and carefully poured tea for Bruno, his attitude super humble. "Father."

Bruno picked up the teacup, took a sip, and placed it on the edge of the table. "Richard, I ask you, do you want Michael's life, or that woman's life?"

Richard frowned. "Elodie's situation was an accident. I'm here today to give you an explanation."

As he spoke, Richard pulled a short knife from his pocket, removed the sheath, and the sharp blade flashed coldly. Without any hesitation, Richard aimed the knife at his own heart and stabbed down.

"Richard!" Michael let out a low groan, crawling forward a few steps. The movement tugged at his wounds, causing him to feel as though he were being torn apart.

The blade pierced Richard's chest, but thanks to Quentin's timely intervention, it only went halfway in, with a large part still outside.

Richard had aimed for his heart, but the blade had shifted slightly, missing the vital spot.

Quentin turned to Bruno. "Father, Richard cannot die."

Bruno sipped his tea calmly. "Why, do you also think the Black Family can't do without him?"

"That's not what I mean." Quentin shook his head. "I'm just worried about Elodie."

Bruno said nothing.

Quentin continued, "Paralysis is already a fatal blow to Elodie. If Richard also dies, I'm afraid Elodie won't survive!"

Michael glanced at Quentin, feeling grateful to him at that moment. Only by saying this could Richard's life be saved! As long as there was room for negotiation, everyone still had a chance. It all depended on how they played their cards!

After a brief silence, Bruno spoke slowly, "Richard, I'll give you a chance. Marry Elodie, become my son-in-law, and give her a stable life. Then we're good."

Richard supported himself on the ground with one hand, blood gushing from his wound.

He didn't respond to Bruno's demand. The person he wanted to marry was Nina.

Richard had promised Nina that once he finished his tasks, he would retire, marry her, and live a normal life. But now...

Bruno said, "If you don't agree, then let Nina pay for Elodie's legs. Even if you die for her, it won't matter! I'll send her down to meet you soon. Besides her, there are many others; including the Jose family and the Landon Group. I'll deal with them one by one."

Richard's eyes shifted. Nina had suffered too much in the first half of her life; she deserved some happiness now.

Richard asked, "Bruno, can you give me some time?"

Bruno stood up. "I'll give you three days to clean up the mess. Return to Silvercrest, and I'll arrange your wedding with Elodie."

Richard bowed his head, trembling from his wounds, barely able to stand. "Thank you, Mr. Black."

"Coming." Isabella went to open the door. The moment it swung open and she saw Nina standing there, she was initially taken aback. But then, joy spread across her face. She reached out, pulled Nina inside, and embraced her tightly. "Nina!"

Nina seemed to be in a daze. Her clothes were too thin, her face pale, and she didn't look well.

Nina said, "Bella, don't ask anything. I just want to take a shower and change clothes here."

Nina didn't go back to the Jose family or Richard's villa because she didn't want them to see her like this.

Nina wanted to clean herself up first, calm down, and then go back.

"Okay. Okay," Isabella agreed repeatedly, "I'll take you upstairs."

After settling Nina in the bathroom, Isabella quickly called the Jose family.

###chapter 389 As Long As I Can Be with Seb

Nina soaked in the tub for like, forever, before she started feeling human again.

A knock on the door broke the silence, and Isabella's voice floated in. "Nina, can I come in?"

Nina turned her head. "Yeah, come on in."

The bathroom was a steam room by now. Isabella brought in a plate of fruit and set it on the chair next to the tub, sneaking a peek at Nina. Then she asked, all careful-like, "Nina?"

"I'm good." Nina forced a smile.

To make Isabella chill, Nina grabbed a piece of watermelon.

The tub was a bubble fest. As soon as Nina pulled her arm out, Isabella spotted a massive bruise.

"What the heck happened?" Isabella grabbed Nina's hand, eyes welling up. "Nina, did the Black Family hurt you?"

"No." Nina shook her head. "I just bumped into something."

Isabella wasn't buying it. She brushed away the bubbles, revealing more bruises.

"Bella." Nina curled up. "I'm really okay."

Seeing these bruises, Isabella couldn't even imagine what Nina had been through.

Nina went quiet for a bit, realizing she couldn't hide it anymore. "Yeah, they hit me."

"How could they hit an unarmed woman? Are they even human?" Isabella's fists clenched, voice shaking with anger.

"Luckily, it's just some surface wounds, nothing major," Nina tried to comfort her.

Isabella knew Nina didn't want to make a big deal out of it. Everyone knew Richard was just a puppet for the Black Family. Plus, Nina felt guilty about what happened to Elodie, so she wanted to just let it go.

Isabella drew the curtains, shut all the windows, and brought some medicine to treat Nina's wounds.

While she was doing that, Nina asked, "Elodie's leg?"

Isabella's hands paused. "I heard she might not be able to stand again."

Nina sighed. "If I knew it would end like this, I would've tried harder to hold onto her."

Isabella said, "Nina, no one can see the future. Accidents happen in a flash. You do have some responsibility, but if Elodie hadn't been bugging you all the time, this wouldn't have happened. It's done now, so don't beat yourself up."

Nina looked at her, a bit surprised. "Bella, you've changed."

Isabella looked puzzled.

Nina said, "If this was before, I'd be the one comforting you. Didn't expect you to be the one comforting me today."

Isabella hugged her. "You've had my back for so many years; of course, I want to have yours now."

Nina was exhausted. She ate a bit and then crashed.

Isabella thought for a moment and called Richard. She wanted to let him know Nina was with her.

Isabella was partly worried Richard would freak out and partly wanted Nina to stay the night.

Richard was usually super clingy with Nina. Normally, he wouldn't let her stay over and would come get her no matter how late. But this time, he agreed right away and didn't ask much before hanging up.

The Landon Group.

Seb wrapped up his day's grind just as Laura brought Bradley over.

Laura said, "Mr. Landon, Dr. Vaughn is here."

Seb rubbed his temples, looking beat. "Perfect timing, let's get started."

He got up, ditched his jacket, and flopped onto the sofa.

Laura slipped out quietly.

Bradley drew the curtains, dimming the room. He sat next to Seb and started the hypnosis session.

After about ten minutes, Seb opened his eyes but saw nothing.

Bradley frowned, looking puzzled.

Seb sat up, glanced around, and looked bummed. "Another bust?"

Bradley nodded silently, looking pretty down.

Seb felt a splitting headache. This had happened too many times! Every hypnosis session was a flop. When he opened his eyes, he never saw the person he wanted to see.

The questions weighed on him like a ton of bricks, almost crushing his spirit.

Seb held his temples. "Why is this happening?"

Bradley handed him a glass of water and some painkillers.

Seb downed them without a second thought.

The meds needed time to kick in, so he had to tough it out for now.

Seb leaned back on the sofa, his head tilted, feeling the pain tearing through his nerves, his eyes bloodshot.

Bradley said, "Mr. Landon, if you have time, we should hit the lab."

Seb turned to look at him. "What are you getting at?"

Bradley glanced around. "Your office is quiet, but it's not a professional setup. The successful hypnoses were all in the lab. Here, they always fail. We should go back to the lab."

Seb nodded. "Let's roll."

Bradley drove, and Seb sat in the back. As they left the parking lot, Seb called Isabella.

Seb said, "Hey, Bella, I might be back late. Don't wait up; get some sleep. See you tonight."

Just that one call seemed to drain all of Seb's energy. He slumped against the seat, tormented.

Bradley drove fast, getting to the lab in under twenty minutes.

At this hour, the other lab staff had already bounced.

Bradley used his access card to open the door and smoothly brought Seb into the treatment room.

Maybe it was the drive or the painkillers kicking in, but as soon as Seb lay down, his eyelids felt heavy.

Bradley lit some special-scented incense, the kind he always used for Seb's treatments. Seb found the scent pretty soothing.

This time, the hypnosis was almost effortless.

Seb slowly drifted into the dream; Bradley got up and left.

Moments later, the door gently opened from the outside; Siena, in a pure white dress, walked in.

Because Seb had been swamped lately, Bradley had been going to the Landon Group for his treatments. Siena couldn't conveniently follow, so she hadn't seen Seb for days.

Siena sat on a chair, holding Seb's hand, pressing his palm against her face, gently rubbing it.

After a while, Seb's eyelashes fluttered, and he slowly opened his eyes.

His gaze was calm. "Mom?"

Siena knew Seb had mistaken her, but it didn't matter; she was willing. As long as she could be with Seb, the method didn't matter! What mattered wasn't the result but the whole process!

###chapter 390 What Did You Just Say?

Siena's lips curled up a bit as she gave Seb a soft look but didn't say a word.

Seb was just lying there, all chill. "Mom, who's my dad?"

This was Seb's big hang-up.

No matter who he was with, Seb always tried to keep this on the down-low. Now, he wanted the real deal. Once he knew, he could move on.

Siena reached out, her fingers lightly brushing Seb's cheek. "Seb, you're my son. That's what matters."

Seb's brow furrowed. "But who's my dad?"

Like Siena had a clue. She dodged the question, "That doesn't matter."

"No way." Seb sat up, suddenly all fired up. "It matters to me! Mom, spill it. Who's my dad? Did you really cheat on Charles?"

Siena was a bit thrown but quickly tried to calm Seb down, "Seb, that's ancient history. Let's drop it, okay?"

"No!" Seb grabbed Siena's wrist out of nowhere. He stood up, the thin blanket slipping to the floor. He stared at Siena with a wild look in his eyes. "Tell me the truth. I deserve to know!"

Seb's grip was strong, his expression kinda scary. The veins in his eyes, which had calmed down, now popped out again, more intense and freaky than before.

"How would I know who your dad is..." Siena blurted out without thinking.

Seb froze, shocked. "What did you just say?"

"Seb, it doesn't matter!" Siena quickly backtracked, but her freaked-out look gave her away.

Seb wasn't buying it. He looked around the room, suspicion growing.

Seeing this, Siena reached into her pocket for a syringe; while Seb was distracted, she quickly jabbed it into his arm.

A sharp pain hit, and with a quick slap, Seb knocked the syringe away and smacked Siena across the face.

Siena stumbled and hit the cabinet with a dull thud.

Bradley burst into the room, locking eyes with Seb. "Mr. Landon."

Seb suddenly realized it was all a setup. He turned to leave, but his tall frame wobbled. The injection Siena gave him kicked in, and Seb collapsed to the floor, out cold.

Bradley shut the door and rushed over, grilling Siena, "What happened?"

Siena shook her head. "I don't know. He figured out we were playing him!"

Bradley glared at her. He bent down, lifted Seb off the floor, and put him back on the recliner.

During this, Siena got her act together. Standing by the recliner, she looked at the sleeping Seb, feeling a bit freaked out. "What now? He knows the truth, he won't keep up the treatment. Will I never see him again?"

"Shut up!" Bradley snapped, losing his cool.

He should be the one worried! His treatment was working. It was Siena's lousy acting that almost wrecked his research! Whether Siena saw him again didn't matter. If his research succeeded, it would be a game-changer worldwide!

"Dr. Vaughn, you have to do something!" Siena couldn't stay quiet for more than ten seconds before speaking up again.

Bradley stormed to the door, opened it, and said coldly, "Get out!"

Siena called, "Dr. Vaughn."

"Get out!" Bradley had had enough.

He had zero respect for someone as clueless as Siena. If Quentin hadn't told him to and if she hadn't been somewhat useful in Seb's treatment, he would've never used someone like Siena!

Siena didn't want to leave, but seeing Bradley's face, she didn't dare stick around. After hesitating for a sec, she bailed.

Bradley locked the door and quickly lit up two incense sticks. He was gearing up for a deeper hypnosis session on Seb.

The next morning.

When Isabella woke up, she found the bed empty. Seb was MIA.

She got up and looked around the bedroom but found no sign that Seb had come back.

Isabella frowned. Did Seb not come home last night?

Confused, Isabella went downstairs. She smelled food as she got closer to the kitchen.

Nina was just bringing out breakfast. "You're up? Perfect timing, wash your hands and eat."

Isabella was about to head to the dining room when the doorbell rang.

She opened the door to find a delivery guy. "Is Isabella here? Got a package for her."

"That's me." Isabella's eyes lit up when she saw the package. She signed for it and brought the box inside.

She didn't even bother with breakfast and started tearing open the package in the living room.

Nina walked over. "What are you opening?"

Isabella didn't answer. She opened the box and took out the items one by one, placing them on the table.

Nina's eyes widened when she saw the stuff. "What are these?"

Isabella said, "Look familiar? These are all the perfumes listed on that sheet on your desk."

Nina sat down and picked up a bottle to check it out, then asked Isabella, "How'd you know I was looking into this?"

"I didn't. Just a lucky guess." Isabella said, "Looks like I guessed right. Why are you suddenly into these? Planning to start a perfume line?"

Nina shook her head. "I don't have that kind of skill."

Nina held the perfume box, turning it over to check the ingredients. "Ever since we had that fallout with Harmony Jewelry, I've been getting targeted. I dug around and found out it was mostly Mrs. Nelson's doing. Vilma from Harmony Jewelry is her niece."

Isabella said, "Yeah, I know that. Got a plan?"

Nina said, "To fix this, we need to hit the root cause. People who know Ophelia say she doesn't like to meddle and is pretty chill. So why's she gunning for us? When I met her, I noticed a weird smell on her. Then I had someone find out what perfume she uses."

"And then?" Isabella was all ears.

Nina said, "Isn't it weird? Perfume's supposed to cover up smells. Who uses such strong perfume and still can't cover up the stink? How bad must she reek?"

Isabella remembered what Kelsey had said. She said, "I heard this kind of perfume is fine for normal folks. But for those with body odor, it makes things worse. Long-term use can even mess up your sense of smell and cause permanent body odor. I remember when I first met Ophelia, she didn't have that smell. But the last time I saw her, I did notice it. Even if she can't smell it herself, wouldn't someone tell her? Even if outsiders are too shy to say anything, Nathaniel would, right?"

Nina's expression grew more thoughtful. "Do you know who designed this brand of perfume?"

Isabella asked, "Who?"

Nina answered, "Vilma."

###chapter 391 On My Way

Nina kept going, "So, I dug up some dirt. Teef Perfume kicked off a few years back. Vilma was still hitting the books in college then. Right before she graduated, Ophelia and Nathaniel threw some cash her way to get the biz rolling. When Teef Perfume first hit the scene, they went all out with ads. They even blew a ton of dough on celeb endorsements, but it barely made a ripple. It was hot for a minute, then tanked hard and went belly up. Most of their perfumes vanished, but for some reason, the one I mentioned is still kicking around."

Isabella chimed in, "I actually found these after scouring a bunch of apps. Sales are practically zilch, so it's probably gonna vanish soon too."

The more they dug into it, the sketchier it seemed.

Isabella grabbed some scissors, popped open a bottle, and gave it a spritz.

"This one's got a lavender vibe," Isabella said, taking a whiff. "It's light but kinda nice. Doesn't smell like what Ophelia rocks, though."

Nina nodded. "Try another one."

Isabella had snagged over a dozen bottles. After cracking them all open, they still couldn't find the one that matched Ophelia's scent.

"These all smell like regular perfumes. Are we barking up the wrong tree?" Isabella wondered, scratching her head.

Nina shook her head. "Nah. I've seen Ophelia whip it out before. Same packaging, black swan on the bottle. She's definitely using this brand."

Isabella asked, "So, what's the deal then?"

Nina held the bottle, thinking. "I got a hunch."

Over at the Nelson crib.

Nathaniel woke up and leaned against the headboard, messing with his phone, which was blowing up with messages. Who he was texting was anyone's guess.

Ophelia strolled out of the walk-in closet holding a dress. She walked over to the bed and asked, "Nathaniel, does this dress work for today?"

Nathaniel gave it a quick glance. "Yeah, sure, it's fine."

Then he went back to his phone.

Ophelia took a few steps closer to snatch his phone, but Nathaniel was ready and locked the screen just in time. "What are you doing?"

Ophelia stood by the bed, eyeing Nathaniel. "Who are you texting? You've been acting weird lately. Morning and night, you're glued to that thing. Sometimes you even grin like an idiot at it; don't think I haven't noticed!"

"No way," Nathaniel denied.

Ophelia wasn't buying it and held out her hand, demanding, "Hand it over!"

"There's really nothing, babe." Nathaniel sat up, grabbed Ophelia's hand, and pulled her into a hug. "Just work stuff, I swear."

"I don't believe you!" Ophelia wasn't some gullible kid anymore. She was determined to check Nathaniel's phone.

Nathaniel asked, "You really wanna see?"

Ophelia said, "Yeah, I need to see it!"

Seeing she was serious, Nathaniel gave in. "Alright, fine, see for yourself."

He pulled the phone from under the pillow and handed it to Ophelia.

Ophelia said, "Password."

Nathaniel punched in the code, and the phone unlocked.

Ophelia scrolled through Nathaniel's phone but didn't find anything fishy. Everything-texts, social media-was all work stuff.

"Done snooping? No issues, right?" Nathaniel asked, looking all cool and collected.

Ophelia tossed the phone back to him. "Nathaniel, when you get some downtime, can we hit up Simbara?"

"Why Simbara?" Nathaniel didn't seem too thrilled.

Ophelia said, "We need some beach vibes, a little vacay. Remember? When we got hitched, you promised a honeymoon in Simbara."

"We're old news now; who needs a honeymoon?" Nathaniel chuckled.

Ophelia playfully punched him. "It's 'cause you've been swamped with work! I don't care. Next month, we're going to Simbara. And we can swing by Aidamore to see our son."

Nathaniel said, "Simbara and Aidamore are miles apart. That's a big detour."

Ophelia insisted, "I don't care. I miss our boy and wanna see him."

"Alright, alright, whatever you say." Nathaniel agreed, but it was clear he was just placating her.

"Deal. No backing out." Ophelia kept reminding him, then switched back to her dress. "Is this dress cool for today?"

Nathaniel didn't even look up. "Yeah, yeah, it's fine. You look great in anything."

Ophelia said, "Vilma gave me this dress. I'm just worried it's too plain and people might think I'm trying too hard to look young, but I dig the style."

"Vilma gave it to you?" Nathaniel finally looked up. "Vilma's got great taste. You'll look awesome."

Ophelia beamed. "Right? I think so too. I'll go try it on."

Nathaniel nodded. "Sure thing."

Ophelia took the dress and headed back to the walk-in closet. "Don't go anywhere. I need your opinion once I try it on."

"Got it." Nathaniel agreed easily.

As soon as Ophelia disappeared into the closet, Nathaniel picked up his phone and entered another password.

Good thing he was smart about it; he had one phone with two profiles.

The one he showed Ophelia was the work profile. The current profile was Nathaniel's private stash.

Nathaniel opened the chat, and the other person had sent a bunch of pics. [Got a new dress. How's it look?]

Nathaniel clicked in and saw it was the same dress Ophelia was about to try on.

Vilma: [I gave the same one to Ophelia. Did she try it on for you?]

Nathaniel: [She's changing now.]

Vilma: [So, who rocks it better, me or her?]

Nathaniel: [You, obviously. She's getting old; doesn't matter what she wears.]

Vilma: [When are you coming over? I'll wear it for you.]

Nathaniel glanced at the closet.

Nathaniel: [On my way.]

He grabbed his briefcase and bolted.

A few minutes later, Ophelia came out dressed. "Nathaniel, I still think this color's too young for me."

But Nathaniel was already gone.

Ophelia sighed, feeling a bit helpless. "All he cares about is work!"

She muttered, then went back to the closet, changed into something else, and left the house.

###chapter 391  Let's Get Married

Nina was like, "Hey, Mrs. Nelson."

Ophelia barely stepped out when she bumped into Nina.

"Well, ain't this a small world?" Ophelia muttered, looking bored, and tried to walk off.

Nina slid in front of her, blocking the way. "Not really. I came here just to find you."

Ophelia's eyebrows knitted together as she took a cautious step back. "What's your deal?"

Nina cut to the chase, "I need to talk to you, Mrs. Nelson. This place is too crowded. Can we go somewhere quieter?"

Ophelia rolled her eyes. "I don't care what you wanna say. I got stuff to do." She really didn't want to be alone with Nina.

She tried to leave, but Nina grabbed her wrist, stopping her.

Ophelia spun around. "What do you want?"

Nina stayed calm. "Mrs. Nelson, it's about Vilma. Don't you wanna know?"

"Vilma?" Ophelia's interest piqued. "Alright, spill it. What do you wanna say?"

Nina let go of her hand. "I booked a spot at a nearby cafÃ©. If you got time, can we chat there? I promise it'll be worth your while."

Ophelia hesitated, then sighed. "Fine."

At the cafÃ©, Nina ordered two coffees.

As soon as the waiter left, Ophelia jumped in, "Alright, what's the deal? Talk."

"No need to rush." Nina grinned. "Mrs. Nelson, try the coffee first."

Ophelia scowled. "Ms. Miller, I didn't come here for coffee. Get to the point and quit wasting my time."

Nina nodded. "Okay, straight to it. Sorry if this is forward, but are you using Teef Perfume?"

"Yeah." Ophelia looked confused. "Why?"

Nina shrugged. "No biggie. Just noticed the scent is kinda unique."

Ophelia missed the hint and lifted her chin proudly. "It's a rare brand. Not many know it. Didn't expect you to have such a sharp nose, Ms. Miller."

Nina smirked. "Mrs. Nelson, which series are you using?"

"This one's a custom blend from Vilma. You can't buy it. It's one of a kind." Ophelia eyed Nina. "Did you drag me here just to ask that?"

Nina shook her head, her face turning serious. "Mrs. Nelson, did anyone ever tell you that folks with body odor shouldn't use Teef Perfume? It can make the smell worse, and over time, it might never go away?"

"What are you talking about?" Ophelia frowned. "I don't get it."

Nina decided to be blunt. "Mrs. Nelson, honestly, the scent on you is pretty bad."

Ophelia was shocked, her face turning red. "That's ridiculous!"

Nina raised her hand and called the waiter over. "Excuse me, can you smell this lady's perfume?"

The waiter looked surprised but leaned in closer to Ophelia.

As soon as he got a whiff, his face twisted in disgust. He quickly covered his nose and stepped back.

The waiter was flustered, not knowing what to say. If he told the truth, he'd offend Ophelia. If he lied, the smell was really strong!

"What's the matter?" Ophelia's frown deepened, her eyes narrowing at the waiter. "Do I really smell that bad?"

Then she turned to Nina. "Ms. Miller, I don't know what game you're playing, but this is a low blow."

Ophelia couldn't take it anymore. She snatched her bag and bolted.

"Mrs. Nelson," Nina called out, her voice urgent. "If you trust me, can you let me take your perfume? I wanna get it checked by an expert."

Ophelia shot her a glare. "No way! Ms. Miller, I trust Vilma. She'd never hurt me."

With that, Ophelia stormed off without a backward glance.

Nina headed home first to grab some clothes. She planned to crash at Richard's place tonight.

She called Richard; he said he was at the villa.

But when Nina got to the villa, the place was dead quiet, not a single light on.

She flicked on the lights and went upstairs. Richard was on the phone in the study.

Nina waited at the door for a bit. After he hung up, she walked in. "Richard."

"You're back," Richard said, his brow furrowed tight. He tried to play it cool, but Nina wasn't dumb. She could feel his tension.

Richard was always the one in control. Nina had seen him exude confidence, but right now, she sensed his uncertainty.

Did the Black Family make some demands? Nina felt uneasy and went up to hug Richard.

Her nose was sharp, and she immediately caught the scent of blood on him. She quickly pulled back, her eyes scanning him in panic. "Are you hurt?"

Richard brushed it off. "It's nothing, just a scratch."

"Where?" Nina didn't dare touch him, just asked.

Richard pointed to his chest. "Here."

Nina's heart skipped a beat. That was where the heart was!

She raised her hand to unbutton his shirt, her fingers trembling slightly.

Richard didn't stop her. He lowered his head, his gaze fixed on her face.

Nina finally unbuttoned his shirt and saw a big piece of gauze on his chest, stained with blood. Her lips trembled. "This is a scratch?"

A little more, and it would've hit his heart! This was serious, yet Richard spoke so casually.

Richard held her fingers and smiled. "Wanna count the scars on my body and see if this really is just a scratch?"

Nina's eyes trembled.

She'd been with Richard long enough to know the scars on his body. There were many, each telling the story of Richard's dark and tough past.

But this one was different. Just feeling it through the gauze made Nina's heart race.

Nina asked, "Was it the Black Family?"

"I did it myself," Richard admitted. "If I didn't, Bruno wouldn't chill out."

Nina knew in her heart that Richard did this for her.

"Why are you so stupid?" Tears welled up in Nina's eyes.

Richard cupped the back of her head, pulling her into his embrace. "Don't cry. I'm fine, aren't I?"

Richard was even smiling.

Nina couldn't stay as calm as he was. She reached out to hug him, her tears soaking his shirt.

After a few days apart, their longing for each other grew wild.

Even though Richard was hurt, it didn't stop him from performing in bed. After a few rounds, Nina was already panting, covered in a sheen of sweat.

Afterward, she lay on Richard's chest, listening to their intertwined heartbeats. "Richard, let's get married."

Richard was stunned but didn't respond.

Nina looked up at him, her fingers brushing his jaw. "I wanna marry you. You can retire and leave the Black Family. Then we'll get married, have a kid like Bella and Seb, and live a normal life."

###chapter 393 Painkillers

Richard was quiet for what felt like forever.

Nina picked up on the weird vibe and glanced at him. "What's up with you?"

Richard used to be all over her, dropping the marriage bomb more than once, but Nina always dodged it gently.

She'd been burned by a bad marriage before and was seriously spooked.

Even though she knew Richard wasn't Charlie, she was still crawling out of the wreckage of her last marriage and just didn't have the guts to dive back in.

Nina figured there was no rush; they had all the time in the world.

But after the whole Black Family mess, something shifted in her.

Richard was a drifter, just like her, with no place to call home. She knew how badly he wanted to settle down.

When she saw Richard get hurt for her, all her doubts vanished. Even if Richard was a blazing fire, she'd jump in without a second thought.

Richard's fingers played with Nina's hair, twirling it around before letting it go. After doing this a few times, he finally spoke up, "Didn't you want to wait until your career was solid before talking about marriage? Why the sudden change?"

Nina replied, "That was the old me. Now I just want to get hitched; I want to marry you. We're not getting any younger; it's time to settle down."

Richard stayed silent, his deep eyes becoming even more unreadable.

Nina's heart clenched, and she blurted out, "Don't you want to?"

She thought Richard would be over the moon, but he was way too calm.

"I do," Richard said earnestly, "I even dream about marrying you."

He pulled Nina into his arms, gently running his fingers through her hair, slowly sharing his feelings, like he was picturing their future.

Richard said, "I want to have a little yard, plant some fruit trees, put up a grape arbor, and have a swing. In the summer, we'll chill under the grape arbor. You'll be lounging in a wicker chair, smiling at me, and I'll be pushing our kid on the swing."

"That sounds amazing." Nina's lips curled into a smile, but then she remembered something, a flicker of worry in her eyes.

"Yeah, it would be perfect." Richard's arm around her tightened a bit.

Nina snapped back to reality. "Bella's wedding is coming up soon. After their wedding, we can start planning ours."

Richard looked down at Nina's hopeful smile; the words he wanted to say swirled in his mind but stayed unspoken.

Late at night, Isabella had dozed off on the couch.

Suddenly, she heard the door open and jolted awake. She jumped up and ran to the door.

"Seb." Isabella rushed over and hugged him.

Seb wrapped his arm around her waist, burying his chin in her neck. "Why aren't you asleep yet?"

"I was waiting for you." Isabella stepped back, noticing the exhaustion etched on Seb's face. Her heart ached. She cupped his face with both hands, looking into his eyes. "You look beat. You okay?"

Seb took her hands and kissed them. "I'm fine."

Isabella offered, "How about I run you a bath?"

Seb nodded. "Sure."

They headed upstairs.

Isabella went to run the bath while Seb shrugged off his jacket, unbuttoned his shirt, and slumped onto the couch.

The sound of running water filled the bathroom; Seb's headache was pounding.

Bradley had said today's hypnosis was a success, but Seb's headache was worse than ever, not the usual relief he felt after treatment.

Plus, Seb had no memory of the hypnosis session, his mind a blank slate. Unlike before, he didn't see Anna in this hypnotic dream.

The pain intensified; Seb gritted his teeth. He pulled a bottle of pills from his suit pocket. The pain was so bad his whole body was shaking, especially his hands.

"Seb, the water's ready." Isabella's voice came from the bathroom.

Seb jumped, dropping the pill, which rolled to Isabella's feet.

He quickly hid the pill bottle behind his back.

Isabella was startled too.

She knew Seb was secretly undergoing treatment and taking meds. She'd never confronted him, always pretending not to know.

But now, she'd caught him red-handed.

After a moment of awkwardness, Isabella bent down to pick up the pill. She walked over to Seb, pretending to be clueless. "What's this?"

Seb visibly relaxed. He took the pill from her. "Vitamins."

"Oh." Isabella nodded. "I'll get you some water. It's not good to swallow it dry."

"Okay." Seb took the pill from her, his fingers curling around it.

Isabella poured him a glass of water, watched him swallow the pill, then handed him clean clothes. "Go take your bath."

"Okay." Seb got up and headed to the bathroom.

Isabella glanced at the suit jacket on the sofa, then turned her head towards the bathroom. She reached into Seb's pocket and pulled out a bottle of pills, just as she suspected.

She unscrewed the cap and poured out two pills, identical to the one she had picked up earlier.

The large letters on the bottle stung her eyes.

Isabella muttered, "Painkillers."

Seb came out of the bath; Isabella was leaning against the headboard, scrolling through her phone.

He walked over, lifted the blanket, and lay down. Closing his eyes, he looked exhausted.

Isabella turned off her phone and the bedside lamp, then snuggled into his arms.

In the quiet night, Isabella felt a sudden urge. Her hand slipped under Seb's shirt, her fingertips gently caressing his skin.

Soon, Seb responded, flipping over and pressing her beneath him.

###chapter 394 Moved

The next day.

After scarfing down breakfast, Isabella got a call from Nina.

Nina wanted her to tag along to the hospital.

Isabella freaked out, thinking something was wrong with Nina. But when they got there, she found out Nina had an appointment with the OB-GYN.

"Nina," Isabella's eyes darted to Nina's belly.

Nina got the hint, grabbed her hand, and said, "Nope. I'm just here for a check-up because I wanna have a baby."

"Wait, you want a baby?" Isabella got all excited, "For real?"

"Yeah." Nina nodded, but she looked kinda worried. "Actually, Richard and I were using protection at first. But then we stopped. Bella, I'm kinda scared I can't get pregnant."

"Why do you think that?" Isabella tried to comfort her, "You're still young; Richard's healthy as a horse. You guys are in your prime. Take care of yourselves, and you'll definitely have a baby!"

Nina nodded, but she still looked anxious. "When I was pregnant with Charlie, I had to take a ton of meds to conceive. Then I had a massive hemorrhage and lost the baby; the doc said it might be tough for me to get pregnant again."

"Where there's a will, there's a way," Isabella said, "Medical science is super advanced now; there's gotta be a solution. Let's see what the doc says first."

Nina nodded. "Okay."

Nina went through all the tests; the doc frowned for what felt like forever before saying, "In your case..."

Nina and Isabella held their breath, staring at the doc, scared he'd say something bad.

After a long pause, the doc said, "Because of the previous miscarriage surgery, your uterus got damaged, so it's tough to conceive now. But it's not impossible. Chill out, and it'll happen when the time's right."

Nina asked, "Do I need to take any meds? For my last pregnancy, I had to take a ton of meds to conceive."

The doc tapped away at the keyboard, making notes, and said, "There are medications that can help. I'll prescribe some for you."

Nina didn't hesitate. "Thanks, doc!"

The doc smiled. "We'll start with a safe amount. Too much can mess you up."

As they were leaving, Nina still looked a bit anxious.

The doc called out to Nina. "Getting pregnant is also about your mindset. Especially for those who have trouble conceiving, it's super important to stay positive. Relax, and it'll happen when the time's right."

Nina's frown eased a bit. "Thanks, doc."

Nina went home and immediately prepped the meds.

She took a big bowl, and the smell wasn't as bad as before.

Nina carefully took a couple of sips. It was a bit bitter, but not as bad as the last meds.

Despite the taste, Nina was willing to tough it out to get pregnant.

"What are you drinking?" Richard walked in from outside.

As soon as Richard entered the house, he smelled the nasty odor. When he walked into the kitchen, he saw Nina holding a big bowl of something, frowning even more.

Nina said, "Meds."

Richard asked, "Why are you taking meds?"

Nina felt a bit embarrassed but didn't want to hide it from him, so she told him the truth.

Richard then took the bowl from her and turned to pour it into the sink.

Luckily, Nina stopped him in time, protecting the bowl of meds. "What are you doing?"

Richard frowned. "If getting pregnant means you gotta go through this crap, I'd rather skip the baby thing!"

Nina quickly covered Richard's mouth with her hand. "Don't say that. What if the baby hears and gets upset and decides not to come?"

Richard took her hand and held it in his palm, a bit amused. "How can you believe all that stuff?"

Nina didn't care. "As long as I can get pregnant."

Richard's eyes flickered, and for a moment, he was at a loss for words.

Seeing Nina like this, his heart felt like it was being twisted, the pain almost suffocating him.

Richard raised his hand, gently tucking Nina's hair behind her ear, and said softly, "Actually, not having a baby isn't a bad thing."

Without a baby, it would be easier for Nina to remarry in the future. If Nina hated him in the future and had to face his child every day, how would she endure the rest of her life?

Nina glared at him. "I told you, don't say things like that!"

Richard smiled and agreed, "I won't say it."

He raised his hand and took another bowl from the cabinet.

Nina looked at him, puzzled. "What are you doing?"

Richard didn't answer Nina but took the bowl of medication from her.

"Don't pour it out," Nina exclaimed.

But the next second, her eyes widened.

Richard didn't pour out Nina's medication but he tilted the bowl and poured half of it into another bowl.

Then, Richard handed the bowl with the lighter taste to Nina. "You drink this."

Richard picked up the other bowl and drank it in a few gulps.

Nina stared at him, her heart pounding.

Richard wiped the medication from his mouth and said, "Having a baby isn't just your responsibility. How can I let you suffer alone with such bitter medication?"

Nina's eyes sparkled, her heart filled with warmth.

Nina vaguely remembered when Charlie forced her to take medication.

At that time, she complained that the medication was too bitter and strong that she wanted to vomit.

However, Charlie just impatiently scolded her, even accusing her of being unreasonable and pretentious.

Because of her past experiences, Richard's actions now moved her even more.

Richard put down the bowl and gently pinched Nina's nose. "Are you moved?"

Nina sniffed. "No."

She just felt that meeting Richard was the best thing that ever happened to her.

In the evening, Isabella held the invitation in her hand, squeezing it repeatedly. Finally, she gathered the courage to leave the house and went next door.

The lights were on, indicating someone was home.

Isabella knew she might not see Esme, but she still wanted to try her luck.

She hadn't seen Esme for several days, and her calls were still going straight to voicemail.

Isabella was about to knock on the door when it opened from the inside.

Quentin stood in the doorway, looking surprised to see her. "Bella, do you need something?"

Isabella asked, "Is Esme here?"

"She's not here," Quentin said, glancing at the invitation in her hand. "But if you have something to say, I can pass it on. I'm about to go to the hospital to see her."

Isabella asked, "How is Elodie? Is she okay?"

Quentin shook his head.

He didn't say anything, but his expression was very serious. That was enough to explain the situation.

Isabella didn't have the courage to ask further. She handed over the invitation. "Please give this invitation to Esme. My wedding is in two days, and I hope she can come."

Quentin took it and agreed readily, "Okay."

"Thank you." Isabella said with a nod.

Quentin suddenly called out to her, "Isabella."

Isabella was confused. "Yes?"

Quentin's eyes were conflicted, as if he had something to say but he was hesitant for some reason.

###chapter 395 Good Girl

Isabella stopped in her tracks and said, "Spit it out if you got something to say."

Quentin hesitated for a sec, then said, "Nah, it's nothing. Just wondering if you're really sure about tying the knot with Seb."

"Totally." Isabella nodded.

Marriage was a big deal; she had obviously thought it through. If she had doubts before, she was now dead set on Seb after everything they'd been through.

She couldn't figure out why Quentin was bringing this up right before her wedding.

Quentin locked eyes with Isabella and said, "You know, you could do better."

Isabella raised an eyebrow, "What are you getting at?"

"Sure, with Seb, you'll be fine in Lakina. But Bella," Quentin suddenly stepped closer, his intense vibe making her catch a whiff of something odd.

Isabella's head spun. She wanted to back away, but her body wouldn't cooperate. She stood there, kinda numb, her eyes glued to Quentin's.

Quentin said, "Bella, the world's huge and amazing. If you check out Silvercrest, you might change your mind. Maybe you're head over heels for Seb now, but time changes everything. I don't want you regretting this in a few years."

Isabella took in every word Quentin said, feeling deep down he was off base, but she couldn't find the words to argue.

She just watched as Quentin stood in front of her. He raised his hand and brushed her cheek. "Nina's a prime example. You saw her stuck in a miserable marriage. Do you want that? You're still young, with endless possibilities. If you're up for it, I'll take you to Silvercrest."

Quentin's voice was low, each word clear; he was gently trying to convince her.

When he finished, he held out his hand to Isabella. "Bella, take my hand. Let me pull you out of this mess. I'll give you a better life."

Isabella looked at Quentin's pale palm, then slowly raised her hand and placed it in his.

"Good girl." Quentin grinned, satisfied, holding Isabella's hand and leading her inside.

When Isabella woke up, she was on the couch in Quentin's living room.

She opened her eyes, saw the unfamiliar room, and shot up.

Just then, Quentin walked out of the kitchen. He was in loose, comfy clothes, holding two cups. Seeing Isabella on the couch looking lost, he smiled and said, "You're up?"

Isabella watched him stroll over. Even after Quentin set the two cups on the coffee table, she couldn't remember how she ended up in his house or how she crashed in his living room.

Her mind was a total blank. When she tried to think, a dull pain hit her.

Quentin said, "Here, juice."

Isabella eyed the colorful juice in the cup, her throat feeling like it was on fire. She felt like she had just walked out of a desert, desperate for a drink.

She was super thirsty; the juice's bright color was calling her name.

Driven by instinct, Isabella reached out, but as soon as her fingers touched the cup, she snapped back to reality and pulled her hand away.

Isabella looked at Quentin. "Why am I here?"

Quentin looked surprised, genuinely puzzled.

Then he smiled and said, "You forgot?"

Quentin's question left Isabella puzzled.

Quentin smiled and said, "You came to drop off the invitation."

There was an invitation on the coffee table, with patterns and a logo that Isabella had designed herself, super familiar to her.

"And then?" she asked, frowning. Isabella felt like she had missed something big.

Quentin said, "Then you suddenly fainted. I brought you in to rest for a bit. You mumbled that you were really thirsty and wanted juice. As soon as I finished making it, you woke up."

According to Quentin, only about ten minutes had passed.

Isabella instinctively looked at the clock on the wall, and the time matched.

But why did those ten minutes feel like forever? And even if she fainted, she shouldn't feel this bad. It felt like a chunk of her memory had been wiped out.

"Bella?" Quentin's voice broke through.

Isabella suddenly stood up, looking at him warily. "It's late. I should go."

She said this but didn't leave right away; she kept staring at Quentin.

Quentin nodded, not pushing her to drink the juice or insisting she stay. He stood up and said, "I'll walk you out."

With that, Quentin turned and headed towards the door.

As soon as she stepped outside, the cool night air hit her, making Isabella shiver and her head throb even more.

Quentin followed her out. "It's cold. Want to take a coat?"

Isabella instinctively refused, "No need."

Then she rubbed her arms and took off.

After Isabella had entered her home, Quentin still stood under his own eaves, quietly gazing at her house in the shadows of the night.

After a while, Quentin's lips curled into a silent smile. "Lova, it won't be long now. Just wait for me."

###chapter 396 The Small Town

Isabella got home and chugged five glasses of water like it was nothing.

Sure, the thirst was kinda gone, but she still felt off. All she could think about was that fresh juice Quentin had given her.

She licked her lips, thinking, 'I could really go for some juice right now.'

So, she opened the fridge, grabbed a couple of oranges, and spent way too long figuring out the juicer. Finally, she had a glass of juice.

She downed it, and the pulp sliding down her throat made her feel way better.

After finishing the juice, she felt pretty satisfied and not as thirsty. Maybe it was just in her head, but even her headache seemed to chill out.

Thinking back on everything, she still felt a bit freaked out.

She knew Quentin was a sneaky dude; she had been super careful, but it looked like he still got the best of her.

Isabella was almost sure she had been hypnotized.

Thinking of Quentin's deep, mysterious eyes, she felt a shiver run down her spine.

She couldn't figure out why Quentin would hypnotize her.

People always have a reason for what they do. She didn't believe Quentin would mess with her for nothing.

And he managed to hypnotize her so quickly. If it happened once, it could happen again. And if it happened again, there'd probably be a next time.

Isabella felt that no matter how careful she was, as long as she was alone with Quentin, she was screwed.

Quentin was so powerful; how could she protect herself? She had no clue, but she instantly thought of Marvin.

The last time she ran into Marvin at the Landon Group, she had kinda asked about stuff like this. But she forgot to ask how to avoid getting hypnotized without knowing it.

She didn't have Marvin's number. She planned to wait for Seb to come back and ask him for it.

While waiting for Seb in the living room, she was scrolling through her phone and saw a status update from Kelsey.

The caption read: [The slow life of a small town is also where my heart belongs. Darling, wherever you are, that's where I am.]

The post had nine pictures; the first eight were of scenery and food, and the last one was of two hands intertwined.

This sweet post made Isabella smile. She casually gave it a like.

Just as she did, Miley's nickname popped up right after hers.

Seeing Miley's nickname, Isabella was momentarily stunned.

She had been so busy that she forgot to call Miley. She had said before that she would ask Miley and Kelsey to be her bridesmaids.

Isabella clicked on Miley's profile when a message from Miley came through.

Miley: [You still up, Bella?]

Isabella leaned back on the sofa and started chatting with Miley.

She told Miley about the wedding and invited her to be a bridesmaid.

Miley agreed right away.

Miley asked about Jack and Kelsey, and also about Steven and Margaret. She asked about nearly everyone, except Zaire.

Isabella knew Miley was avoiding the topic, so she didn't bring it up either.

They were chatting happily when Kelsey suddenly called with a video call.

Isabella told Miley that Kelsey was calling; Miley said she had something to do as well, so they ended their conversation.

Isabella clicked the video answer button, and after a few seconds of buffering, a dark screen appeared.

"Is it frozen?" Isabella asked.

"No, it's not frozen." Kelsey's voice came from the dark screen.

Kelsey laughed. "Bella, what's with that face? Not happy to see me? Am I interrupting your alone time with Seb?"

Isabella said, "The problem is I can't see you at all."

Kelsey was taken aback, then there was some fumbling on her end. Suddenly the screen brightened, and Kelsey's face appeared.

Kelsey happily greeted Isabella, her eyes filled with joy. "Sorry, I had the camera facing the wrong way. I had the phone on the bed. Can you see me now?"

"Yeah." Seeing Kelsey all smiles, Isabella jumped in, "I saw your status. Looks like you're having a blast at Jack's hometown?"

Kelsey said, "I'm having the time of my life. Bella, you wouldn't believe it. When we were coming here, he told me his hometown was remote, poor, and rundown, with crappy transportation. I was so worried. But when we got here, I found out it's this historic small town with old-school buildings, far from the hustle and bustle. It's really beautiful!"

Once Kelsey started talking, she couldn't stop and went on and on.

Isabella laughed and teased, "How come I never noticed you have the potential to be a tour guide?"

"Bella, don't make fun of me," Kelsey said, "I just really love it here. Honestly! I'd be willing to live here for the rest of my life."

Isabella said, "You might be willing, but Steven and Margaret might not be."

Even though the Jose family had three kids, Margaret might not be cool with Kelsey marrying far away.

Margaret cherished Kelsey, whom she had raised with great care. How could she handle Kelsey being so far from home?

Kelsey pouted. "I've grown up. Even if they don't like it, they can't stop me if I really want to."

That's true. In this world, how many parents could truly control their kids? If they could, there wouldn't be so many cases of people breaking ties with their parents for so-called love.

Of course, Isabella knew Kelsey was just talking. Kelsey wasn't the type to be blinded by love. Besides, Jack worked and was settled in Lakina, so they would definitely stay there in the future. Kelsey was just chasing novelty; if she were truly made to stay in that place, she would flee faster than anyone.

Isabella smiled and changed the subject. She asked seriously, "Are you staying at Jack's house now?"

Kelsey said, "No, we're at a hotel. We got here in the afternoon, and he showed me around. It's getting late, so we planned to visit the Wilson Family early tomorrow morning."

"Okay." Isabella nodded.

Kelsey seemed a bit uneasy. "Bella, I'm a little nervous now. I'm afraid his adoptive parents won't like me."

"That's unlikely," Isabella said, "First of all, your looks, family background, and education are great. No matter how you look at it, you are excellent. Besides, nowadays, people often value the freedom to love. I believe any open-minded elders won't be too difficult to get along with. Just relax, and Jack will handle everything."

"Yeah, yeah." Kelsey breathed a sigh of relief. "Hearing you say that makes me feel much better."

They chatted for a while longer. Isabella thought of Marvin, so she casually asked, "Is Jack with you now?"

Kelsey said, "Yes, he is. Why, Bella?"

Isabella asked, "Does he have Dr. Finn's number? I have something I want to ask him."

"Oh, let me ask him." Kelsey got up with her phone and walked a bit. Isabella heard her asking Jack.

"Dr. Finn?" Jack was puzzled. "He's been assigned a task by Mr. Landon and is currently unreachable."

Even so, Jack still sent Marvin's number over.

Isabella tried to contact Marvin several times, but just as Jack said, Marvin's phone was always unreachable.

Unable to reach Marvin, Isabella felt even more puzzled. If Marvin wasn't in Lakina, then who was treating Seb now?

As far as she knew, Seb's most trusted private doctor was Marvin.

The clock ticked away.

As the night deepened, Isabella felt more awake and alert.

Outside the window, the cat named Cheese was meowing again.

For some reason, even though it was Quentin who had saved it, the cat seemed to prefer to come to her house.

Whenever Isabella heard it meow, she couldn't help but feel a chill.

The window was closed, so Cheese couldn't jump in, but Isabella still picked up the remote and closed the curtains.

Even with the curtains closed, Cheese didn't leave and kept meowing under the window.

The constant meowing made Isabella feel irritable and uneasy.

She picked up her phone and called Seb, but there was no answer.

She thought Seb might be at Marvin's lab, so she glanced at the clock-it was almost midnight. Then she grabbed her coat and car keys, deciding to go to the lab to find him.

###chapter 397 There Is a Secret

The night wind was biting cold. Even with a coat on, Isabella felt the chill right down to her bones.

As soon as Isabella stepped outside, the cat's meowing stopped. The silence around her was creepy, and she instinctively gripped the car keys in her pocket, hurrying to her car while glancing at the living room windowsill.

She couldn't see anything in the dark bushes. She figured the cat must've taken off.

Once she was in the car with the doors locked, Isabella finally started to relax a bit.

She buckled her seatbelt, let out a long breath, and started the car.

The visibility was terrible, so Isabella drove slowly. Just as she was about to leave the yard, a dark shadow suddenly darted from the left side of the road, heading straight for her car.

Isabella screamed and slammed on the brakes.

When the car stopped and she looked up, she thought she saw a cat's tail disappearing into the bushes.

She thought, 'That cat again! Wasn't it under the windowsill? How did it get here? It's just a cat, not a ghost; how could it be so sneaky?'

The only good thing was she wasn't driving fast; otherwise, if she had hit it, the cat would be a goner.

Even though Isabella wasn't a fan of that cat, she didn't want to run it over.

She took a deep breath, started the car again, and drove off.

Maybe it was the earlier scare, even after leaving the villa area, Isabella stayed super cautious, worried she might hit something.

When she finally got to the studio, she grabbed a couple of tissues to wipe the sweat off her forehead, unbuckled her seatbelt, and got out of the car.

The research lab under the moonlight had a cold glow. As Isabella walked in, the nurse at the front desk stood up and asked, "Miss, who are you here to see?"

Isabella replied, "I'm looking for Seb."

The nurse gave her a once-over. "And you are?"

Isabella said, "I'm his fiancÃ©e."

The nurse said, "Mr. Landon is in treatment. Would you like to wait downstairs for a bit?"

Isabella asked, "Can I go up and wait?"

The nurse said, "I need to check with Dr. Vaughn."

Isabella vaguely remembered that the last time she met Marvin at the Landon Group, there was a young guy with him. Marvin had introduced him as his student; she couldn't remember his name, but it was something like Vaughn.

The nurse went back to the front desk, made a call, said a few words, and then came back to Isabella. "Dr. Vaughn said Mr. Landon has already left."

Isabella was surprised. "Where did he go?"

The nurse shook her head. "I don't know; maybe he went home?"

Isabella frowned. "Can I talk to Dr. Vaughn? I have some questions for him."

"Sure." The nurse made another call. After getting Bradley's approval, she led Isabella upstairs.

Bradley met Isabella in an office. He personally poured her a glass of water. "Ms. Miller, what can I do for you?"

Sensing Bradley was busy, Isabella got straight to the point. "Dr. Vaughn, I want to know how to avoid being hypnotized."

Bradley looked a bit surprised. "Is it you who's been hypnotized, or someone else?"

Isabella said, "It's a friend of mine. She has some doubts about this. She heard that a really skilled hypnotist can hypnotize someone in just a few seconds. My friend thinks this is exaggerated, but she still wants to know how to stay awake and not get hypnotized if she realizes it's about to happen."

Bradley said, "Well, besides the hypnotist giving up halfway, there's one thing you can try."

Isabella asked, "What's that?"

Bradley replied, "Inflict pain on yourself with something sharp or keep yourself in pain. That's the only way to avoid being hypnotized."

Isabella asked, "Is there any way to avoid self-harm?"

Bradley shook his head seriously. "Not at the moment."

Isabella paused, then asked, "Can a hypnotist alter or erase the memory of the person being hypnotized?"

This was a big deal. If it was just hypnosis, it wasn't a huge problem. But if memories could be altered or erased, that was a whole different story!

Bradley's eyes flickered for a moment. Instead of answering right away, he asked, "What makes you think that?"

Could it be that Seb noticed something when he got back, or did Isabella figure something out?

Isabella said, "I'm just curious. I read a novel where the heroine was hypnotized by a really skilled hypnotist who messed with her memories, making her fall in love with someone else after losing her memory."

"That's just fiction," Bradley replied. "In real life, I haven't seen anyone who can do that."

Isabella breathed a sigh of relief. "So, even the best hypnotist can only hypnotize people and not mess with their memories, right?"

"Exactly." Bradley nodded, looking serious.

Isabella exhaled. "That's a relief."

Just then, the alarm clock on Bradley's desk went off. He turned it off and said to Isabella, "Do you need anything else? If not, I need to get back to work."

"No, that's all." Isabella thought for a moment and then said, "Dr. Vaughn, could you not tell Seb that I came to see you?"

Bradley looked puzzled. "Why?"

Isabella said, "To be honest, I already know he's secretly undergoing treatment. And he's doing it for me. With the wedding coming up, I don't want to stress him out. Just pretend I never came and that I don't know anything."

Bradley nodded. "Okay."

"Thanks." Isabella left, feeling satisfied.

The research lab was huge; Bradley, probably worried she'd get lost, assigned a staff member to escort her downstairs.

As soon as Isabella left the office, a nurse wearing a mask hurried over. "Dr. Vaughn, something's wrong. Mr. Landon is having another episode! You need to come quickly."

Isabella paused. Didn't Bradley say Seb had already left?

"Ms. Miller, the elevator is here." The staff member gestured for Isabella to step in.

Isabella nodded and got into the elevator.

Almost as soon as the elevator doors closed, Bradley strode out of the office, followed by the anxious nurse.

The nurse thought Bradley was heading towards the treatment room but was surprised when he suddenly turned towards the elevator.

"Dr. Vaughn, you're going the wrong way." Even though the nurse urgently reminded him, Bradley seemed to ignore her and headed straight into the elevator.

The nurse, growing increasingly anxious, could only follow along.

When she entered the elevator, she saw Bradley standing there, staring at the descending floor numbers on the wall.

It took only a few seconds to go from the second floor to the first.

After that, the number stayed on the first floor and didn't move again.

"Dr. Vaughn, are you taking the elevator?" the nurse asked.

Bradley turned around and glared at her. "You're fired."

The nurse was stunned. By the time she reacted, Bradley had already walked past her like a gust of wind.




Dear Readers,

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for your continuous support and love for my ongoing novel. Your enthusiasm and feedback have been the driving force behind my writing.

After careful consideration, I have decided to adjust the update frequency of the novel from three ###chapters daily to three ###chapters weekly. This was a difficult decision, but it was made for the following reasons:

Quality Assurance: I wish to have more time to refine each plot, character, and detail to ensure that the quality of the work is elevated. By reducing the frequency of updates, I can focus more on crafting each ###chapter, ensuring that every update brings you surprise and satisfaction.

Health and Life Balance: Writing is a passionate yet energy-consuming endeavor. To maintain sustainability in my writing, I need to better balance my creative work with my personal life, ensuring I have sufficient time for rest and reflection, which will ultimately allow me to provide you with high-quality stories in the long run.

Better Story Development: A longer creation cycle will allow for deeper plot planning and character development, making the entire storyline more coherent and enriching.

I understand that this change might disappoint some readers who were looking forward to daily updates, and for that, I sincerely apologize. I hope you can understand my decision and continue to support me. I promise that each update will be worth the wait.

Thank you for your understanding and support. See you next week!

Best wishes,
Elowen Thorne
###chapter 398  Don't Touch Me

Isabella stepped out of the elevator, feeling more and more uneasy with each step she took.

A staff member noticed something was off and turned to her, "Ms. Miller?"

Isabella snapped back to reality, patted her pocket, and said, "I left my car keys in Dr. Vaughn's office."

"I can grab them for you," the staff member offered.

"No, it's fine," Isabella replied, stopping him. "I'll go up myself. I just remembered I have another question for Dr. Vaughn."

The staff member hesitated.

Marvin wasn't around, and Bradley was calling the shots. Bradley wasn't as easygoing as Marvin; he usually had a stern look and took out his frustrations on the staff. In the few days Marvin had been away, several colleagues had already been fired.

The staff member was genuinely worried about getting on Bradley's bad side.

"What's wrong?" Isabella teased, sensing his discomfort. "Afraid I'll steal something from your lab?"

The staff member, knowing who Isabella was, quickly waved his hand. "No! You're Mrs. Landon, and Mr. Landon is Dr. Finn's boss. Why would you be interested in our stuff? I'm just worried Dr. Vaughn might blame me."

"Don't worry; I'll explain it to him," Isabella said casually.

Given Isabella's special status, the staff member thought, 'As the boss's wife, she can come and go as she pleases.'

No matter how arrogant Bradley was, it was only towards his subordinates. He had seen how humble and respectful Bradley had been towards Isabella just now. So, there shouldn't be any big problem.

The staff member said, "Alright, you go ahead. I'll wait here."

Isabella nodded. "Okay."

"What's going on?" Bradley asked, pushing open the treatment room door and taking in the scene.

Siena was half-kneeling on the ground, her white dress stained with something dirty, while Seb was lying on the floor, his head resting on Siena's lap, eyes closed, but his expression uneasy.

The floor was a mess, with various reagents and tools scattered everywhere.

Siena was holding Seb's cheeks with both hands and said, "Dr. Vaughn, come and take a look."

Bradley squatted down, lifted Seb's arm, and found a needle mark. Next to Siena's hand was an empty syringe.

"You used the anesthetic on him again?" Bradley's eyes were so fierce it looked like he wanted to devour her.

Siena's eyes flickered with guilt. "You told me that when I can't control him, I can use the anesthetic."

Bradley said, "I had already put him in a semi-hypnotic state. You just needed to play your role and help him resolve his issues. Did you provoke him again?"

"I didn't!" Siena instinctively defended herself.

But facing Bradley's scrutinizing eyes, she guiltily looked away.

Bradley grabbed her wrist. "How did you provoke him?"

Siena couldn't break free from his grip and had to confess, "I didn't provoke him. Seb kept fixating on a question. He insisted on asking me, so I casually mentioned a name, and then this happened."

After Siena finished, Bradley's eyes became even more terrifying. "Idiot! Don't you know that's his issue? I asked you to help resolve it, not to aggravate it."

"Dr. Vaughn, I really didn't mean to." Siena panicked, afraid that Bradley wouldn't let her see Seb next time; she quickly begged for mercy.

Bradley gritted his teeth. If it weren't for Quentin's instructions, he would have kicked Siena out long ago.

"Enough," Bradley snapped. "This is your last warning. Screw up again, and you're out!"

Siena nodded quickly, "Yes, Dr. Vaughn, I'll follow your instructions."

Together, they moved Seb back to his original spot. Siena sat beside him, her hands never leaving his face, her obsession almost creepy.

Bradley cleaned his hands with disinfectant and said coldly, "If you don't leave now, you'll have to explain everything to him when he wakes up."

Siena was stunned but quickly left.

As soon as she stepped out, she saw Isabella.

Isabella was at the end of the corridor, slowly opening each door like she was searching for something.

Siena quickly turned around, put on her mask, and hurried in the opposite direction.

Isabella noticed her. "Hey, excuse me."

Before Isabella could finish, Siena sped up and disappeared into the stairwell.

By the time Isabella caught up, Siena was long gone.

Isabella found it odd. "Why run?"

She turned around and saw Bradley coming out of the treatment room.

Bradley looked momentarily surprised but quickly regained his composure, casually closing the door behind him. "You haven't left yet?"

This time, Isabella caught the subtle change in his expression. Bradley had clearly been a bit flustered when he saw her.

What was Bradley flustered about? Isabella didn't know. But she was almost certain that Bradley had lied when he said Seb had already left.

Isabella said, "I left my car keys; I came back to get them."

Bradley nodded. "Did you get them?"

Isabella replied, "Yes, I did."

Bradley guessed she hadn't run into Siena; otherwise, she wouldn't have this expression and would have asked more questions.

Isabella's gaze fell on the door behind Bradley. "Dr. Vaughn, do you have a patient this late?"

"Yes," Bradley said calmly. "But it's almost over."

Isabella stared at him for a dozen seconds before slowly speaking, "Is Seb in there?"

Bradley remained silent.

At this moment, silence meant confirmation.

Isabella walked past him and went straight to open the door.

Bradley just frowned but didn't stop her.

Isabella saw Seb lying on the thin sofa bed, eyes closed, his brow furrowed.

Even in his sleep, Seb was clearly uneasy. Isabella gently reached out to push him. "Seb."

Bradley stood behind her and said, "Mr. Landon is still in a hypnotic state. He's sleeping deeply. You'd better not wake him forcibly; it could stimulate his cerebral cortex and cause irreversible damage."

Isabella withdrew her hand. "When will he wake up?"

Bradley replied, "In about half an hour."

Isabella pulled over a chair and sat beside him. "I'll wait for him to wake up."

Bradley moved his lips but said nothing.

He stood there for a moment, then silently turned to leave.

The room was left with just Isabella and Seb. One was sleeping; the other was watching.

Seb slept deeply but restlessly, his brow constantly furrowed.

During this time, Seb had visibly become more haggard; Isabella felt heartbroken. She couldn't help but raise her hand, wanting to smooth out the wrinkles on his brow.

Suddenly, Seb raised a hand, accurately grabbing her wrist. He gritted his teeth, shouting, "Don't touch me!"

###chapter 399 Good Things Take Time

Isabella jumped a bit. When she took a closer look, she saw Seb's eyes were shut tight, and he was still out cold.

Seb's hand was clamped around her wrist, and his grip was getting stronger.

Isabella knew something was off. She leaned in and gave his shoulder a gentle nudge. "Seb"

But no matter how much she called his name, Seb didn't budge. It was like he was in a deep sleep, maybe even a nightmare.

Isabella thought about going to find Bradley, but Seb's grip was too tight. She couldn't leave, so she stayed by his side until the sky started to lighten. Eventually, Seb began to wake up.

By then, Isabella had dozed off, leaning against him.

Seb shifted a bit, feeling his left hand all numb and his wrist stiff. When he finally opened his hand, he realized he'd been holding Isabella's wrist the whole time.

Her wrist was bruised from his grip. Seb's eyes darkened as he looked at the bruise. He didn't want to hurt her, so he gently rubbed the spot with his thumb.

Isabella stirred, feeling the soft touch on her wrist. She looked up and smiled, "Seb, you're awake."

"Yeah." Seb's throat was dry, and he nodded, his eyes meeting her tired ones. "When did you get here?"

"Last night." She paused, then added, "Not too long ago."

Seb reached out, cupping the back of her head and pulling her into his arms, letting her cheek rest against his chest. His voice was muffled. "Did you know I was getting treatment?"

Isabella blinked. There was no point in lying now, so she admitted, "Yeah."

Seb lowered his head and kissed her hair. "Bella, I didn't want you to worry."

Before he could say more, Isabella pressed her finger to his lips. "You don't need to explain. I get it."

Seb held her hand. "Don't worry. I'll be in great shape before the wedding. Bella, I'll give you a grand wedding."

Isabella nodded. "I can't wait."

Just then, Bradley walked in. "Mr. Landon."

Isabella got up and stood to the side, watching Bradley check on Seb. "How is he?" she asked.

Bradley straightened up. "He's doing well."

Isabella was doubtful. "He slept so deeply last night. I called him a bunch of times, but he didn't respond."

"That's normal," Bradley said. "It's the brain's way of protecting him. After each hypnosis session, Mr. Landon goes into a deep sleep phase."

Isabella still felt uneasy. Last night, she was really worried about Seb. He slept so deeply that she was scared he might not wake up. If it weren't for his breathing and steady heartbeat, she would've freaked out.

Seb saw her worry and smiled. "He's right. It's normal. You don't need to worry."

Isabella didn't say anything more.

Time flew by, and now there was just one day left until the wedding.

Isabella had been super busy these past few days.

Wedding dresses and other stuff were being delivered non-stop; the house was practically bursting with gifts.

Luckily, with Nina and the others helping out, Isabella didn't feel like a chicken with its head cut off.

"Tomorrow's the big day, Bella. You ready?" Nina asked, pulling Isabella aside for a quick chat during a break.

"Yeah, I'm ready." Isabella nodded, then added, "But I'm still a bit nervous."

It was her first wedding, a huge life event, so feeling nervous was totally normal.

Nina smoothed her hair and said, "That's not what I meant."

Isabella paused and looked at her.

Nina asked, "Will Esme come?"

Isabella felt a slight pang in her heart. "I sent her an invite, but I don't know if she'll come. Her phone has been off, and I haven't been able to reach her. When I asked Quentin to deliver the invite, he said she's been at the hospital with Elodie."

Nina sighed. "In her heart, Elodie is still more important."

Isabella took Nina's hand. "It's okay. I believe she has her reasons. Besides, Elodie's condition is really bad. Maybe she wants to come but can't. Even if she doesn't show up, she might be watching me from somewhere, blessing me."

Nina didn't want to bring Isabella down, so she reluctantly said, "Maybe."

As they were talking, footsteps echoed from the stairs. It was Seb and Zaire coming down.

For tomorrow's wedding, there were three groomsmen: Zaire, Jack, and Richard.

Jack and Kelsey were already on their way back and would arrive before the wedding in the morning.

Isabella suddenly realized she hadn't seen Richard all day.

"Where's Richard?" she asked Nina.

Nina said, "He's been really busy these past few days; sometimes he didn't come back all night. He's probably busy today too, but don't worry, no matter how busy he is, he won't forget about tomorrow."

Isabella nodded. "Okay."

Just then, Isabella's alarm went off.

With so much going on, Isabella was afraid of forgetting something. So, the night before, she had organized the tasks for the next day and set alarms to remind her.

The screen showed Miley's arrival time.

Isabella asked, "Miley will land in half an hour, Seb. Can we arrange for someone to pick her up?"

Everyone fell silent, then turned their heads in unison to look at Zaire.

Zaire smiled. "I happen to be going nearby, so it's no trouble to pick her up."

Isabella said, "Thanks."

Zaire said, "My pleasure."

As Zaire left, Margaret smiled and said, "Zaire is so stubborn. He misses Miley so much but pretends like he doesn't care."

Margaret then looked a bit worried. "I just wonder when they'll finally settle their relationship."

Isabella smiled. "Margaret, good things take time."

Margaret said, "I hope so."

###chapter 400  Worth A Fortune

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Elodie leaned back against the bed. "Richard, I want an orange."

Richard had just come out of the bathroom, drying his hands. He frowned. "Didn't you just have a banana?"

He had peeled it for her himself.

These past few days, Richard had to play nice with the Black Family. Every time Elodie called, he had to drop everything and come over.

Richard had never been this patient before. He knew his time with Nina was limited, and he should be spending more time with her. But seeing how much Nina cared about Isabella's wedding, he didn't want to mess up such an important event.

So, he had to suck it up and keep the Black Family happy for now.

"I've got a good appetite today and suddenly want an orange. Richard, peel one for me," Elodie said, bossing him around.

Elodie had never been able to boss Richard around before, but now that he had a weak spot, she was taking full advantage.

She loved being pampered by Richard and wanted more.

Richard pressed his lips together, said nothing, and walked over to grab an orange. He peeled it quickly and placed the segments on the small table.

Elodie didn't move. "Feed me."

Richard squinted. "Elodie!"

"What?" Elodie immediately looked hurt under Richard's cold stare. "Is it that hard? Just feed me an orange."

Richard's patience was wearing thin, but he held back, picked up an orange segment, and fed it to Elodie.

At the airport, Miley walked out and spotted Zaire's tall figure from a distance.

She adjusted her sunglasses and walked towards him, but when Zaire reached out to take her suitcase, she deliberately brushed past him, her steps light and graceful.

Zaire's hand missed, and he turned to look at Miley's graceful figure, gritting his teeth in frustration.

Then, Zaire followed her.

Outside the airport, Miley stood by the roadside, trying to hail a cab.

As she reached out, she felt a sudden pressure on her waist and was swiftly lifted by Zaire's strong shoulder.

Zaire stuffed her into a car. When Miley tried to get out from the other side, Zaire grabbed her ankle and pulled her back.

Zaire pinched her cheeks, squeezing hard. "How many days has it been, and you're pretending not to know me?"

Miley blinked under her sunglasses. "Mr. Jose, didn't we agree to go our separate ways? Did I misunderstand? Now you're grabbing my ankle and pinning me down, what's this about?"

Miley had makeup on, but it was very light. She usually liked to wear bright red lipstick, but today she only had a layer of lip balm, making her lips look full and glossy.

In just a few seconds, Zaire was already captivated by Miley. His eyes darkened, and he squeezed Miley's ankle harder, his voice husky. "What do you think? You want to cut ties with me? That's a bit difficult."

The car behind them started honking impatiently.

Zaire gently patted Miley's cheek, his tone like coaxing a child. "Stay put."

Then he got up and left the back seat.

Miley watched as Zaire closed the car door, walked to the back, and put her suitcase in. Then Zaire returned to the driver's seat and drove away from the airport quickly.

All the way, she suspected Zaire was treating the brake as the gas pedal and the gas pedal as an airplane throttle because he was speeding excessively.

They both didn't speak.

Several times, Miley glanced up, catching Zaire's eyes in the rearview mirror.

They locked eyes for a few seconds, but neither said a word. Then Zaire looked back at the road, and Miley turned to stare out the window.

Finally, the car came to a stop.

The door opened, and Zaire stood outside. "Get out."

Miley hesitated but then stepped out.

Seeing the grand building in front of her, Miley was stunned.

She thought it would be a hotel, but it turned out to be Zaire's castle, his most private place.

Miley had heard about this place for a long time, but it was her first time here.

Servants came out to greet them. Zaire told them to take the luggage inside and then turned to Miley. "Follow me."

Miley didn't know what Zaire wanted, but she followed him inside.

The castle was so huge that after walking down a few corridors, Miley was already a bit disoriented.

She followed Zaire all the way inside, and after climbing a few stairs, Zaire pushed open a door to one of the rooms.

Zaire went in first, and Miley followed.

The room was a bedroom, but much larger than usual. Decorated in dark tones like a fairy tale castle, it wasn't gloomy at all; every piece of decor was tasteful, exuding understated luxury.

Miley's gaze was first drawn to the large bed in the center. She chuckled and looked at Zaire. "Mr. Jose, going high-end?"

Zaire didn't respond to her comment. "You'll live here from now on."

Miley lowered her eyes. "What does it mean for me to live here?"

"It means you're my woman." Zaire walked over, took her hand, and said in a coaxing tone, "This time, don't leave."

Miley smiled. "Mr. Jose, have you decided to marry me?"

Zaire said, "I haven't decided."

Miley raised an eyebrow. "So you want to keep me, like before?"

Zaire shook his head. "It's different from before."

Miley was noncommittal. She couldn't see how it was different.

Zaire said, "Before, we only made love in hotels and villas. From now on, we'll only do it here."

Miley laughed. "Mr. Jose, you're so funny."

Miley's bright smile was something Zaire had longed for.

Was it Miley's beauty that made Zaire willing to spend money and offer his own body in the beginning?

Zaire thought he was somewhat addicted to Miley's body. Otherwise, he couldn't explain why he felt so uncomfortable without her in Lakina and couldn't find anyone else to satisfy his needs.

It wasn't that Zaire was particularly virtuous; he just found other women barely passable. When it came to the bedroom, he had no passion for them.

"This castle is worth a fortune. I'll give it to you if you stay." Zaire was eager to make love to Miley.

Miley dragged out the word. "Really?"

Zaire nodded. "Yes."

As he caught a whiff of Miley's scent, Zaire's pent-up desires became hard to contain.

He lowered his head, wanting to kiss Miley's lips.

Miley didn't stop him but asked just as Zaire was about to touch her lips, "Can I have a wedding here?"

Zaire was stunned, then he saw the playful yet serious look in her eyes.

Zaire was confused. "A wedding?"

Miley nodded, her tone calm. "I'm getting engaged next month. If Mr. Jose is free, would you honor us with your presence?"

Zaire froze. "That's not funny," he said.

Miley's phone rang.

She looked at it and said, "It's my fiancÃ© calling."

With that, Miley answered and put it on speaker. "Hello."

A young male voice came from the other end. "Miley, have you arrived in Lakina?"

###chapter 401  Get Out

Before Miley could say a word, Zaire snatched the phone from her.

She didn't try to stop him; she just raised an eyebrow and watched him quietly.

"Who is this?" Zaire asked, his voice cold.

There was a brief pause on the other end, followed by a polite laugh. "Hi, I'm Billy Hill. Are you Mr. Jose?"

Zaire's eyes narrowed. "You know who I am?"

Billy replied, "Miley said you were her ex."

Zaire let out a bitter laugh. "You got it wrong. We weren't really together. It was more of a business arrangement."

Billy went silent for a moment.

Feeling a bit smug, Zaire twisted the knife. "So, are you her new boyfriend?"

"Yeah," Billy's laugh was awkward. "Can you put Miley back on? I need to talk to her."

It was clear he didn't want to deal with Zaire anymore.

Zaire gripped the phone so hard his knuckles turned white. "She's in the shower."

Without waiting for a response, Zaire hung up and tossed the phone onto the bed.

He then wrapped his arm around Miley's waist, pulling her against the door. His face was angry, eyes blazing. "Already found someone new, huh?"

"Yep." Miley kept smiling. "I've told you, Mr. Jose, I'm in high demand."

Zaire gritted his teeth, pressing his body against hers. "Break up with him."

Miley asked, "Why should I?"

Zaire replied, "Because I want to renew our contract."

Miley laughed. "Mr. Jose, I'm not selling myself."

She pushed him away and turned to open the door.

But as soon as she cracked it open, Zaire slammed it shut again with his hand.

He pinned her against the door, his teeth grazing her earlobe. "Miley, whatever you want, I'll try to give it to you. Stay with me; I really need you."

Miley knew Zaire's need was purely physical. But her needs were different.

After a moment of silence, Miley smiled. "Mr. Jose, I want to be Mrs. Jose. Can you give me that?"

Zaire's breath hitched. "Anything but that."

Miley lifted her head. "But that's the only thing I want."

Zaire gritted his teeth. "Are you sure?"

Miley nodded. "Yes. I'm sure."

After a moment, Zaire finally let go.

Miley turned back and saw him opening the window, pulling out a pack of cigarettes, and lighting one.

She opened the door, paused, and said, "Smoke less; it's bad for your health."

There was no response. Zaire didn't even turn his head. The smoke scratched his throat, leaving a faint bitterness.

He furrowed his brow, exhaled the smoke, and impatiently said, "Get out."

"Goodbye," Miley said softly, disappointment flashing in her eyes, then she turned to leave.

Downstairs, Miley realized the place was pretty remote. The quiet road was as deserted as a wasteland; there was no way to get a cab.

She stood in the yard for a moment, looked back at the third floor, and saw Zaire's silhouette in the window.

There was some distance between them, and with the dim night, she couldn't see Zaire's expression clearly. But she had a feeling he was looking at her with impatience.

Sure enough, a few seconds later, Zaire stubbed out his cigarette and disappeared from the window.

She decided not to ask him for help. Miley pressed her lips together, dragging her suitcase along the path.

Just as Miley was about to contact Isabella, she heard the sound of a car behind her.

Miley turned around, squinting against the car's headlights, raising a hand to shield her eyes until the car slowly stopped beside her.

Inside, Zaire sat expressionless, looking straight ahead, his tone cold. "Get in."

Miley didn't bother being polite with Zaire. In this situation, being polite would be asking for trouble.

She didn't think that after angering Zaire, he would have the patience to coax her.

So Miley obediently walked to the back of the car, opened the trunk, and put her suitcase inside. Then she opened the back door and got in.

Zaire's brow furrowed slightly for a moment. But he said nothing, started the car, and drove off.

After dropping Miley off at Isabella's house, Zaire didn't even get out of the car. He just turned around and left.

Miley dragged her suitcase up the steps when Billy's call came in again.

Miley pressed the answer button. "Hello."

"Miley, are you okay?" Billy asked, not even sure why he was asking. He hadn't called again since then. This call came an hour after the last one.

During that hour, Billy had been restless, his mind filled with Zaire's words. "She's in the shower."

Finally, Billy couldn't stand it anymore and mustered the courage to call Miley again.

Hearing Miley's voice, for some reason, Billy's heart settled.

Miley indeed understood what Billy said. "Yes. I'm fine. Billy, thank you for calling me tonight."

Actually, Billy wasn't Miley's boyfriend. Itt boyfriend was just a lie she made up to fool Zaire.

Billy was Miley's classmate. They hadn't seen each other in years. After Miley got into college, she left her hometown and worked in Lakina. Billy, after graduating, followed his family's wishes and stayed in his hometown to work.

Billy was honest and decent, with a good family background. He was doing well at work and even had a small leadership role.

This time, Miley went back for a blind date and ran into Billy at a restaurant. They had a few meals together; Billy was very attentive to her during this time.

Miley had worked in the red-light district before, so she knew exactly what Billy thought of her.

After their last meal, Miley confessed to Billy, "I have someone I like. Because he won't marry me, I came back for a blind date."

She still remembered Billy's embarrassed expression at that time.

Miley said, "Billy, you're a good person. I don't want to lie to you."

"It's okay." Billy smiled, trying hard to appear relaxed, but he still looked a bit awkward.

Then they went their separate ways.

Miley thought that was the end of it.

###chapter 402 Study Hard

Billy called Miley out of the blue late that night.

Miley, half-asleep, grabbed her phone without checking who it was. "Who is this?"

"It's me, Billy," he said.

"Billy?" she mumbled, still groggy.

"Yeah, it's me."

Miley turned on the light and saw it was just past 1 AM. "Why are you calling so late? Is something wrong?"

Billy sighed. "I've been thinking a lot about what you said earlier today."

Miley couldn't remember what she had said. Billy continued, "Thanks for being honest with me. I know you have someone else in your heart, but if you're okay with it, I can wait."

"Billy," Miley started.

"No matter how long it takes, I'm willing to wait," Billy said, his voice tinged with helplessness and guilt. "I missed my chance when we graduated high school. I don't want to miss it again."

"You liked me in high school?" Miley raised an eyebrow.

"Yeah, ever since I transferred and became your deskmate," Billy admitted, still shy even as an adult.

"We were deskmates when we started high school?" Miley had no memory of this.

In her mind, Billy was always a good student, while she was the struggling one. Miley was popular and used to boys confessing their feelings, but Billy's confession caught her off guard.

"Don't try to fool me," Miley half-joked. "Good students usually like other good students. I remember you were with Helen Perry back then."

"That was just a rumor. I never admitted it," Billy said seriously. "Besides, a person's worth isn't just about grades. To me, you're a genuinely good person."

The term "good person" felt foreign to Miley. If she didn't know Billy better, she would've thought he was mocking her.

Miley thought for a moment. "Sorry, Billy I don't want to talk about this right now."

"I understand. I can wait, no matter how long it takes," Billy said. "I just wanted you to know that whenever you look back, I'll be here waiting."

In the end, Miley still turned him down. "Billy, you're not my type. Don't waste your time on me."

There was a long silence before Billy finally said goodnight and hung up.

A few days later, Miley took Brenda to school to handle her enrollment. Brenda had dropped out for half a year because her family, who favored boys, used their financial situation as an excuse not to send her to school.

Miley offered to cover the costs and convinced Brenda to continue her education. She told Brenda that education was her ticket to seeing the world.

Brenda's eyes sparkled. "If I study hard, will I definitely be able to see the world?"

"Of course," Miley said.

"Just like you?" Brenda asked.

Miley smiled. "Don't use me as an example. I'm always the negative example."

"But you're the one in our family who's done the best and made us proud," Brenda said, brushing off Miley's comment. "I want to be like you and get into a university in Lakina."

"Lakina?" Miley raised an eyebrow. "What's so special about Lakina? I just got back from there. Trust me, you can aim for a coastal city or even Silvercrest."

But Brenda was firm. "No! I want to go to Lakina."

"Why?" Miley asked, puzzled. "Why Lakina?"

Brenda looked down, twisting the hem of her shirt.

She couldn't come up with a reason even after a long pause.

Miley pinched her cheek. "Why are you blushing?"

"I'm not," Brenda mumbled.

As they were talking, they ran into Billy.

In the school hallway, sunlight streamed in, creating a hazy, beautiful scene.

Billy, in a suit and carrying a briefcase, looked refined and elegant with his glasses. He was walking with the principal and other school leaders.

Miley knew Billy was on official business and didn't want to bother him, so she tried to pull Brenda away.

But Billy called out, "Miley."

Miley stopped at the bottom of the steps.

In front of everyone, Billy walked over, his eyes shining as he looked at her. "What a coincidence running into you here."

They hadn't talked since that night. Miley didn't want to embarrass him. "I'm here to handle my sister's enrollment."

Billy looked at Brenda and asked, "Is there anything I can help with?"

"No need," Miley said, glancing at the people behind him. "You go ahead. We won't bother you."

With that, she pulled Brenda away.

After walking a bit, Brenda looked back. "Miley, who was that?"

"A classmate," Miley replied.

"He likes you, doesn't he?" Brenda asked.

Miley tapped her on the forehead. "At your age, do you even know what it means to like someone?"

"I do," Brenda insisted. "The way he looked at you was pure liking."

Miley was taken aback and didn't say anything.

Brenda continued, "Miley, why didn't you let him help? He seems to be a leader, and what might be hard for us could be easy for him."

Miley stopped. "Brenda, who taught you to think like that? Haven't I told you that you have to rely on yourself? You can't always think about relying on others and using connections!"

Miley's sternness scared Brenda, who nodded. "Miley, I'm sorry. I was wrong."

Miley wasn't really angry but felt it was necessary to teach Brenda the right principles. In a family of dozens, Brenda was the closest to her. When their parents passed away, Miley often went hungry. It was young Brenda who stole food from home to feed her.

Miley truly cared for Brenda; part of the reason she came back was to help Brenda re-enroll in school. She didn't want to see Brenda develop wrong ideas.

Brenda clung to Miley's hand and acted cute. "Miley, don't be mad at me. I know I was wrong."

Miley couldn't stay mad. "It's good that you know."

Miley thought the matter was settled, but she didn't know that Brenda secretly went to find Billy behind her back.

###chapter 403 Under Control

Miley had no clue about Brenda's secret meet-ups with Billy.

All Miley knew was that, given Brenda's past grades, getting back into school would be a tough nut to crack. But out of the blue, Brenda got a notice from the school saying her admission was all set, and she could start anytime.

Miley dropped Brenda off at school. To make sure family stuff wouldn't mess with her studies, Miley even got Brenda a dorm room.

From that day on, Billy would hit Miley up on the phone every now and then.

Billy's conversations were always pure and clean, devoid of any romantic undertones.

Miley figured Billy was probably over her; he only talked about their old school days.

She had turned down Billy's love, but she still valued their friendship.

So, during this time, they chatted like old pals. Billy was super eager to share stuff; he'd send pics of his mom's flowers and share funny articles or short videos with Miley.

When Billy heard Miley mention she was heading back to Lakina for a wedding, he freaked out.

He knew the guy Miley liked was in Lakina. The wedding was just an excuse. If they reconnected, Miley might not come back.

That's why, before Miley got on the plane, Billy gave her all sorts of reminders. And after she landed and was at Zaire's fancy castle, Billy called to check in.

Billy's plan was just to ask if Miley had landed and made it to her friend's place. But when Zaire answered, things took a turn.

When Zaire asked if Billy was Miley's boyfriend, Billy didn't deny it; he just went with it and said yes.

That night, Miley was crashing with Isabella. Both had a lot on their minds, and it took Miley forever to fall asleep.

The night outside was foggy; Isabella was also feeling sleepy. She yawned and was about to doze off when the sound of a car downstairs made her eyes snap open.

Isabella listened as the sound faded away. She got out of bed, pulled back the curtains, and looked down.

Seb's car, which had been parked in the yard, was gone. It was almost 3 a.m. What was Seb doing out at this hour?

Curious, Isabella glanced at the still-sleeping Miley, threw on a coat, and left the room.

Seb was supposed to be sleeping in the study tonight. Isabella pushed open the study door; sure enough, Seb was nowhere to be seen.

Isabella called Seb while heading downstairs. "The number you have dialed is currently switched off."

"Switched off." Isabella stopped at the stairway, puzzled.

Just then, there was a knock on the door. The knocking in the middle of the night was kinda creepy.

Isabella paused, thinking she was hearing things. Who would be knocking at this hour?

But when she listened closely, the knocking came again.

Isabella realized it wasn't her imagination; someone was definitely knocking.

Tonight, the Jose family was staying over, so Isabella wasn't scared. She walked to the door and turned on the monitor on the wall, which showed a figure.

Isabella's eyes lit up; without a second thought, she opened the door.

Esme stood there, looking a bit embarrassed when their eyes met. "Bella, I need to talk to you."

Isabella opened the door wider and stepped aside. "Want to come in and chat?"

But Esme didn't move.

After a few days, Esme looked worn out, her hair loosely tied back, missing her usual spark.

Isabella asked, worried, "You don't look so good. Are you okay?"

Esme forced a smile. "What could be wrong with me? The one with the problem is..."

She suddenly stopped and glanced at Isabella.

"Is it about Elodie?" Isabella asked, "Is she not doing well?"

Esme sighed. "Elodie was spoiled by Bruno and me since she was a kid and never faced any hardship. She's got a strong personality. Now that she's suddenly paralyzed, it's normal for her to struggle with it."

Isabella said, "I'm really sorry."

Esme shook her head and smiled bitterly. "Everyone has their fate. This isn't your fault. Bella, I was too harsh on you before, and I've felt awful about it these past few days. But I have to keep an eye on Elodie all the time, afraid she'll do something drastic or cause trouble, so I delayed coming to see you until now. I hope it's not too late."

Isabella said, "Mom, your presence means everything to me, no matter the timing."

Esme nervously rubbed her fingers. "I got a gift for you. Can you come with me to get it?"

Isabella asked, "Where is it?"

Esme said, "At Quentin's house."

Isabella instinctively glanced at the house next door.

A faint light was coming from inside; Isabella asked suspiciously, "Is Mr. Black still up this late?"

Esme said, "He just got back, and I came back with him. Bruno is very strict; Quentin had to use the excuse of getting some clothes to bring me back and give me your wedding invitation."

That sense of unease and oppression was once again visible on Esme. This wasn't an illusion; it was real.

Since Elodie's accident, Esme seemed to be under control. Or to put it more bluntly, she seemed to be under house arrest.

Esme even had to lie to come back and get things.

It's hard to imagine what kind of life Esme was living in the Black Family, behind all that glitz and glamour.

Isabella felt really sorry for Esme. "Mom, you must be unhappy in the Black Family."

Esme forced a smile. "Having lived there for most of my life, what does happiness even matter? My only wish now is for my children to be healthy and happy, without worries."

As soon as Esme finished speaking, a cat's meow suddenly came from Quentin's house. It was Cheese.

Isabella felt that the cat was getting creepier.

Cheese always liked to meow in the middle of the night. It wasn't a normal cat's meow; it sounded like someone was strangling its throat, producing a sharp and terrifying screech, piercing and frightening.

###chapter 404 Catching the Cheater

Esme whipped her head around, eyes darting. Then she grabbed Isabella's hand. "Come on, Bella! We gotta move. I don't have much time."

Isabella barely had a second to process what Esme meant before she was yanked out the door.

She didn't even get to close it before Esme dragged her into Quentin's house and up the stairs.

Esme was in a real rush, her grip on Isabella's hand getting tighter by the second.

Once they were upstairs, Esme pulled a card from a cabinet and shoved it into Isabella's hand. "Bella, this card has my savings. Ten million dollars. It's yours now, as compensation."

"Compensation?" Isabella was baffled. "For what?"

Isabella was stunned, not just by the ten million dollars but by Esme's words.

Isabella thought, 'Shouldn't this be a wedding gift or something? Why call it compensation? Is Esme trying to make up for something?'

Esme's face showed a flash of panic. "Bella, I've wronged you."

She held Isabella's hands tight, tears brimming. "Bella, you'll forgive me, right? You'll understand my pain."

Seeing Esme like this made Isabella's heartache. "Mom, are you in trouble?"

Everything about Esme tonight was off. Her words, her actions-it all felt like a goodbye.

Esme shook her head. "No, I'm fine."

But tears kept falling.

Isabella wanted to ask more, but Esme pushed her out of the room.

Holding the card, Isabella felt a heavy weight in her chest.

She had a bad feeling Esme might be leaving Lakina. With the Black Family's grip on Esme, seeing her again would be tough.

When Isabella went downstairs, she saw someone on the living room sofa.

Quentin, dressed in black, was sitting with his back to her, one hand on the armrest, the other petting something on his lap.

As Isabella got closer, she saw it was Cheese.

Cheese lay there quietly, eyes half-closed, purring softly. It wasn't making a fuss, but it still gave off a creepy vibe.

Quentin's fingers paused, and he turned to look at Isabella. "Bella, you're here."

He patted the sofa next to him. "Come sit."

Quentin had a smile, but it looked eerie to Isabella.

She seriously thought Cheese had gone from a normal cat to a neurotic one because of Quentin.

"No, I should go back." Isabella just wanted to get away from this creepy duo.

But as she took a step, Quentin said, "Seb won't be coming back tonight."

Isabella froze. "What do you mean?"

Quentin replied, "He's spending the night at a hotel with another woman."

"Mr. Black!" Isabella's tone was sharp. "Don't spread rumors. I won't believe it."

"Believe it or not, it's the truth," Quentin said calmly.

Being alone with Quentin was already suffocating, and now, with the cat, it was even worse.

"Fine. Spread your rumors if you want, but I won't believe them," Isabella said, turning to leave.

As she opened the door, Quentin's voice echoed behind her. "Moon Club. You should see for yourself."

Isabella frowned but walked out.

Once home, she immediately pulled out her phone and tried calling Seb. Still off.

With Jack out of town and Zaire staying over, she was out of options.

After a moment, she thought of Bradley. But she didn't have his number.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed twice. A message from an unknown number. At the end, it said Bradley.

Isabella instantly knew it was Quentin.

She looked around, feeling like Quentin was watching her every move. How else would he know she needed Bradley's number and send it at the perfect time? It was like he had a monitor in her brain!

Without overthinking, she dialed the number.

Bradley's voice came through. "Hello, who is this?"

Isabella froze, feeling like she was in a dream, manipulated to move forward.

She paced the living room, trying to calm down.

She pieced it together. Quentin said Seb was at Moon Club with another woman. That was the bait.

Unable to reach Seb, she'd try others around him. Quentin knew this and sent Bradley's number at the right time.

Was Quentin sure she'd call and then go to Moon Club?

Isabella gripped her phone tightly. She couldn't follow Quentin's plan and become his pawn. But what about Seb?

She decided not to act rashly and woke up Zaire.

She explained the situation, and Zaire immediately put on a coat. "I'll check it out."

Isabella was worried. "I'll go with you."

Zaire and Isabella both didn't believe Seb would do such a thing, so he agreed, "Alright."

At Moon Club, someone greeted Zaire. "Mr. Jose, why are you here at this hour?"

Zaire cut to the chase. "Has Mr. Landon been here?"

The person hesitated, glanced at Isabella, and denied it. "No."

"Alright, go back to work," Zaire dismissed them.

The person hesitated but finally left.

Zaire took Isabella upstairs and unlocked a door with his fingerprint.

As they approached the innermost room, Isabella felt uneasy.

Zaire just pushed the door open.

The room was dim, lit only by a dozen candles.

In the flickering light, Isabella saw Seb seated on the sofa, with a woman enveloped in his arms.

Hearing the noise, Siena looked up first. When she saw Isabella, she panicked.

"Siena!" Isabella's mind buzzed.

The candlelight wasn't strong, but it stung her eyes.

"Isabella?" Siena looked caught, pushing Seb and whispering, "Seb, it's Isabella!"

###chapter 405  Caught

Isabella took a step forward without thinking, but Zaire grabbed her arm. "Bella, whatever it is, you can deal with it later."

Isabella was caught off guard. Zaire probably thought she was about to make a scene. Little did he know, she just wanted to see Seb.

Seb was holding Siena tightly. When he turned and saw Isabella and Zaire, his face changed dramatically. "Bella?"

To Isabella, Seb's expression screamed guilt.

Catching her husband with another woman the night before their wedding was the final straw for Isabella.

Just a moment ago, Isabella was hoping the guy holding Siena wasn't Seb. Or maybe Seb had been hypnotized by Quentin, and this whole thing was staged for her.

But when Seb looked up, Isabella's heart shattered. Seb was fully aware of what he was doing! He was really with Siena!

Isabella wanted to believe Seb, but the harsh reality hit her hard.

"Bella." Seb quickly pushed Siena away. He tried to get up, but his legs were weak; he could barely stand. He forced himself up but almost fell.

"Seb," Siena exclaimed, reaching out to help him.

"Bella!" Zaire's voice cut through the air.

When Seb looked up again, Isabella had already broken free from Zaire's grip and was running out.

"Bella." Seb propped himself up with his hands, struggling to stand. His legs were numb, completely useless.

Siena said, "Seb, let me help you."

"Get away!" Seb shoved Siena aside, panting heavily, his eyes locked on her face. "This isn't a dream! Are you Siena?"

Siena bit her lip. "It's always been me, Seb."

Seb was stunned.

Zaire sensed something was off and quickly went over to help Seb up. "What the hell is going on?"

"No time to explain." Seb gripped Zaire's hand tightly. "Quick, go after Bella! I'm afraid something might happen to her!"

Everything that happened tonight was no coincidence! Suddenly, Seb saw everything clearly. Maybe from the start, everything was wrong. From Bradley's successful hypnosis, through his initial encounter with "Anna" in his dream, to his increasing reliance on the dream. Bradley couldn't have done all this alone. It was Quentin! It was the Black Family!

Isabella ran out and bumped into Bradley.

"Ms. Miller?" Bradley looked surprised to see her. "What are you doing here?"

Isabella asked him directly, "Dr. Vaughn, tell me, is Seb really undergoing treatment?"

Bradley paused and said, "Of course."

Bradley's answer seemed natural, but Isabella saw through it. He was lying! He was covering for Seb!

Isabella said, "I already know everything."

Bradley lowered his eyes. "Ms. Miller, I only assist Mr. Landon with his treatment. The rest is his own business, and I don't get involved."

Isabella nodded, despair flickering in her eyes. "So, the person who came out of the treatment room that day at the institute was Siena too!"

Seb always claimed he was in treatment, but he was actually with Siena! What could a man and a woman be doing alone together? The answer was obvious.

Bradley pressed his lips together, saying nothing. His silence was an answer in itself.

As she walked out of Moon Club, Isabella couldn't hold back any longer. She covered her mouth, tears streaming down her face.

Suddenly, a car stopped in front of her, the window rolled down, and Isabella saw Quentin.

Isabella instinctively stepped back. Quentin, still in the car, stared at her. "Bella, he's coming after you."

Isabella turned around and indeed saw a figure.

However, with the backlight and the distance between them, she couldn't clearly discern whether it was Zaire or Seb. The closer the figure got, the more she wanted to escape!

Quentin said, "Get in the car. At a time like this, you should calm down first. Don't listen to so-called explanations."

Seeing the person getting closer, Isabella gritted her teeth and got into Quentin's car.

The car drove away; Zaire was a step too late.

Watching the car drive off, Zaire noted the license plate number and quickly dialed a number on his phone. "Check this license plate number."

The other end said, "Yes, Mr. Jose."

"Seb." Siena handed over a glass of water. "Have some water first. Don't get too worked up."

Seb gritted his teeth, looking up at her for a moment. He didn't move.

Siena mustered the courage to get closer. "This is all a misunderstanding. If Bella doesn't believe you, I can help explain to her. Dr. Vaughn said you shouldn't get too emotional right now; it will affect your treatment."

"Bradley!" Seb gritted his teeth.

After all his years in the business world, he had been defeated by the person he trusted the most!

Someone pushed the door open and walked in.

"Dr. Vaughn." Seeing Bradley, Siena breathed a sigh of relief. "You're just in time. The treatment was interrupted. What should we do now?"

Bradley walked over, glanced at Seb's face, and said, "Mr. Landon, today's treatment will end here. You should rest well here tonight. I'll take you back in the morning, and it won't delay your wedding."

Seb spoke hoarsely, "You're with the Black Family!"

Bradley looked him straight in the eyes and nodded. "Yes."

Seb felt a splitting headache, his cheeks even going numb.

At this moment, Seb only hated his own stupidity!

Bradley said, "Mr. Landon, you're still in the treatment phase. It's best not to get too emotional, or it will not only undo the previous treatment but also be bad for your health."

Seb was agitated. "What did you inject me with? Why can't I move my legs?"

"It was just a common sedative, used in every treatment session. There's no need to worry, Mr. Landon," Bradley said calmly.

Seb gritted his teeth. "Take me back, now!"

"Sorry." Bradley ignored his request, continuing with a cold expression. "You can only rest here tonight."

###chapter 406 Too Late

Bradley said, "Siena, stick with Mr. Landon. I'll get him back before dawn."

"Okay," Siena nodded.

"Bradley!" Seb growled through clenched teeth.

Bradley just shot Seb a cold look and said, "Sorry, Mr. Landon, I only take orders from Mr. Black."

Once Bradley left, it was just Seb and Siena.

"Seb," Siena reached out, grabbing Seb's hand.

But Seb yanked his hand away.

"Seb," Siena called out.

Seb didn't even glance at her. He tried to get up from the sofa a few times, but it was no use.

"Seb, where are you trying to go? Let me help you," Siena reached out again.

Siena thought, 'When someone's at their lowest, they need help. Even if Seb hates me right now, he still needs help.'

She'd be happy to help Seb, but before she could touch him, he pushed her away again.

"Get lost!" Seb shouted.

He shoved Siena aside and managed to stand up on his own. But within seconds, he fell again.

"Seb!" Siena exclaimed.

After being pushed away so many times, she hesitated, not daring to approach him again.

"Seb, what Bradley gave you wasn't just a regular sedative; it had anesthetic too. Your legs won't feel anything for hours. Just listen to me and rest here for a bit. In a few hours, you can go back."

Siena's voice choked up. Her eyes widened, pupils trembling as she watched Seb crawl on the ground.

"Seb," she murmured, heartbroken.

Seb's legs were useless, so he crawled toward the door using his hands.

"Seb, don't waste your energy! Even if you rush back now, it's too late. The Black Family has always wanted Isabella from the start!"

Seb froze. He turned around, eyes blazing. "What did you say?"

Siena squatted down, grabbing Seb's arms, trying to help him up. But Seb didn't budge. Instead, he grabbed her hand and yanked her down hard.

The world flipped for Siena. Before she knew it, Seb had her pinned to the ground, one hand gripping her neck tightly. "Siena, what did you mean? What does the Black Family want with Bella? Speak!"

Siena bit her lip, refusing to talk.

Seb sneered. "You're always a threat. Maybe I should just kill you now."

With that, Seb tightened his grip.

"Seb," Siena gasped, her breath becoming labored. Her face turned from red to pale blue.

At first, Siena didn't struggle; she probably thought Seb wouldn't really strangle her. But now, she was truly scared. Seb wasn't bluffing! He seemed dead serious. The pressure on her neck kept increasing.

Siena was in agony. She started to struggle, but her limbs were weak; she couldn't muster any strength.

Facing death, everything else seemed trivial. Siena raised a hand, clutching Seb's clothes desperately, and forced out, "I'll speak."

Suddenly, the pressure on her neck vanished. Siena gasped for air, almost fainting, while Seb watched coldly.

Once she caught her breath, Seb demanded, "Talk! Why does the Black Family want Isabella?"

Siena looked into Seb's terrifying eyes, scared he'd lash out again, so she spilled everything she knew. "The Black Family has another daughter besides Elodie, named Lova Black. A few years back, Lova fell ill with a strange illness and hasn't been seen since. Rumor has it she's been undergoing treatment. Quentin is obsessed with it. He and Esme came back specifically for Isabella. I don't know all the details, but they want to take Isabella to treat Lova."

Seb's heart clenched. "I see!"

Siena continued, "Seb, Quentin is determined. By now, Isabella is probably already on a plane; she's left Lakina."

Seb was quiet for a moment, then suddenly grabbed Siena's hand. "Siena, take me back. Bella can't be in danger!"

Siena held his hand. "Seb, it's too late. By the time you get there, it might be too late. Why do they want Isabella? It's obvious it's for something on her body. I suspect it's her heart!"

Seb was confused. "Her heart?"

Siena nodded. "Exactly! Think about it, what kind of illness requires one person to save another? Only organs."

"Bella." Pain surged in Seb's eyes.

Seb hated his own stupidity and his powerlessness! Isabella was now in great danger, but he was stuck here!

Seb pushed Siena away and kept crawling forward. Even if he had to crawl, he would get back today!

Siena didn't stop him but went to fetch something. She quickly returned and injected a sedative into the back of Seb's neck.

A sharp pain surged through him, and Seb abruptly shoved Siena away, causing the syringe to fall off. It rolled a few times on the ground before coming to rest quietly in a corner.

Seb felt his neck was wet. He touched it and found his hand covered in blood. The next second, Seb felt dizzy and collapsed to the ground.

Half of the sedative was still in the syringe; it wasn't fully injected because of his resistance. Half the dose wasn't enough to put Seb to sleep, but it was enough to calm him down.

Siena walked over, knelt on the ground, and lay down beside Seb.

Looking at Seb's cold features, she couldn't help but reach out to touch him. "Seb, if sedatives can make you obedient, I don't mind using them on you all the time."

When her fingers touched Seb's lips, Seb's tightly closed eyes suddenly opened.

Siena was stunned. The next second, Seb opened his mouth and bit off half of her finger.

A piercing pain shot through her fingertip, and Siena didn't even have time to scream. With a sickening snap, Seb had bitten off her finger! Seb, with a mouthful of blood, passed out.

Siena looked at her severed finger and started screaming.

Moments later, Bradley walked in. "What are you screaming about!"

Before he could finish, he saw the blood on the ground and was also shocked. Then Bradley quickly walked over to check on Seb.

Siena cried out. "Dr. Vaughn, my hand, my hand, that's not Seb's blood; it's my blood!"

Bradley turned and glared at Siena, his gaze lightly sweeping over her severed finger. "That's Seb's blood. He spat out a mouthful of blood before passing out."

Bradley didn't dare delay and immediately called Quentin.

After getting a series of instructions from Quentin, Bradley said, "Okay, Mr. Black, I'll take care of it."

In the middle of the night, an ambulance came and went with sirens blaring.

A swarm of media personnel besieged the entrance of the Moon Club, capturing haunting images of Seb, who was bloodied and bedraggled, being forcibly ejected from the premises. Accompanying him was a woman, who was equally disheveled, her hair a tangled mess.

The next day, the soon-to-be-married president of the Landon Group, Seb, had scandalous news spreading the world the night before his wedding.

###chapter 407 Blood Transfusion

"This morning, the media caught the president of the Landon Group heading to the hospital. He was with a young girl, and they both looked pretty messed up. The girl was wrapped in a bath towel, and there were some suspicious marks on her. Reporters tried to follow them into the hospital, but the staff stopped them from filming. Insiders say Seb spent the night with some unknown woman at the Moon Club. We still don't know who she is. Here's an interview with a Moon Club staff member. For his safety, we've blurred his face and changed his voice. Let's check out the live interview."

The staff member said, "Hey everyone, I work at the Moon Club. Last night around eleven or twelve, Mr. Landon came in with a woman named Scott. Mr. Landon is a VIP here and always has a private room. He usually comes for business, so we don't ask too many questions."

The interviewer asked, "Have you seen this woman named Scott before?"

The staff replied, "Nope."

The interviewer continued, "Has Mr. Landon brought an unknown woman alone before?"

The staff said, "I can't say for sure."

The TV's sound echoed through the room as Isabella sat on the couch, watching the news on repeat.

"Here, have some water." Quentin bent down, placed a glass of water in front of her, grabbed the remote, turned off the TV, and sat on the couch opposite Isabella.

Isabella looked at Quentin, her face pretty calm. "Where am I, and why did you bring me here?"

Last night, after leaving the Moon Club, she got into Quentin's car. Even though she knew Quentin was dangerous, she somehow found herself stepping into his car.

The perfume in Quentin's car had a strange scent, and Isabella soon fell asleep. When she woke up, she was here.

Outside the window was a quiet forest, and in the distance, she could see a majestic mountain range. The place was peaceful, far from the city's noise, with only the sounds of nature.

Isabella knew making a fuss wouldn't help. She decided to save her energy and figure out what Quentin really wanted.

Quentin was quiet for a moment, then asked, "Bella, if I take you back now, will you still go through with today's wedding?"

Isabella pressed her lips together and stayed silent.

Honestly, she didn't know.

When everything happened, Isabella didn't think about the wedding; her first thought was Sweetie. For Sweetie, this marriage had to happen.

If she put everything else aside and only thought about herself, Isabella felt she needed to sort out the whole situation before deciding. She loved Seb but couldn't accept his betrayal. She didn't know how long it would take to fully process this.

"You don't have an answer, so I'll give you one." Quentin stood up, walked over, squatted in front of Isabella, and took her hand.

Isabella trembled, wanting to pull her hand back but she forced herself to resist. She couldn't back down! To understand Quentin's intentions, she had to endure.

Isabella's silent consent seemed to give Quentin strength. He tightened his grip on her hand. "Bella, Seb doesn't deserve you. Come with me to Silvercrest. I promise you'll be grateful for the choice you make today after you go there."

Isabella's eyes flickered. "Go to Silvercrest?"

She slowly shook her head. "Why should I go to Silvercrest? My family, friends, and everyone I know are in Lakina. I don't want to go to Silvercrest!"

"Silvercrest is gorgeous, full of talented folks. Bella, if you go, I promise you'll fall in love with it," Quentin coaxed.

Isabella thought if she were a naive kid or an eighteen-year-old girl, she might be swayed by Quentin. But why was he so insistent on taking her to Silvercrest? What was his deal?

Isabella looked at Quentin and asked, "Is there any other reason?"

Quentin was caught off guard, then said, "I want you to meet Lova."

Isabella inquired, "Lova? Didn't you mention she had some weird illness and wasn't expected to make it?"

Quentin shook his head, his voice heavy. "No, there's still hope for her!"

Isabella was confused. "How?"

Her eyes were so pure that Quentin couldn't bear to look directly at her. He slightly averted his gaze and said, "Your blood types match, and your body functions are very similar. So, as long as you give her some blood, she can be saved."

Isabella frowned. "Is it really that simple?"

Quentin said, "Of course not. After the blood transfusion, we need to see her reaction. If she can adapt, we'll continue."

Isabella's eyes widened. "You mean?"

Quentin suddenly tightened his grip on her hands and knelt on the ground. "If she can adapt, we need to exchange your blood with hers."

Isabella was stunned. Then, she forcefully pulled her hands back and pushed Quentin away. "I get it. You want me to risk my life to save Lova?"

Quentin nodded.

Isabella wanted to slap Quentin but held back, clenching her fists. "You're despicable. I won't agree!"

Quentin wasn't surprised and said calmly, "But Bella, you've already signed the surgery consent form. How can you go back on your word?"

Isabella thought he was crazy. "When did I sign a surgery consent form?"

Quentin rose, went to a cabinet, retrieved a piece of paper from a drawer, and handed it to Isabella. "Check this out."

Isabella suspiciously took it. It was indeed a surgery consent form. The first page was full of details, and on the last page, there was a prominent signature.

When Isabella saw the signature, she was shocked. "You!"

It was indeed her name and her handwriting; every stroke was hers. But Isabella didn't remember signing it. Was it when she was unguarded, hypnotized by Quentin, and signed it unconsciously?

"You signed this yourself," Quentin said, "So, Bella, even if you regret it now, it's useless."

Outside the window, the sound of a helicopter suddenly came. The rotor blades cut through the air; the helicopter slowly approached from afar, eventually hovering above the rooftop for a moment before gently descending onto the lawn outside the window.

Quentin looked at his watch and said, "It's time, Bella. We need to go."

Isabella was stunned for a moment. When Quentin walked towards her, she suddenly tore the document into several pieces. She tore off the part with her signature, shredded it, ran to the window, and threw it out.

The wind scattered the fragments, and they quickly disappeared.

Quentin merely observed without any attempt to intervene; instead, he calmly stated, "What you just tore up was only a copy."

Isabella froze.

Quentin slowly walked over. "If you want to tear it, I can give you the original. But Isabella, even if you tear the original, I have many ways to make you sign more originals!"

"You're shameless!" Isabella was trembling with anger. She raised her left hand and slapped Quentin.

His eyes narrowed, and he precisely grabbed her wrist.

Isabella's hand was suspended in mid-air. Quentin pulled her over, and before she could steady herself, she felt a sharp pain in the back of her neck.

Isabella stiffened, her wide eyes gradually losing their light. In a few seconds, she lost consciousness and fainted in Quentin's arms.

###chapter 408 Awake

Meanwhile, when Jack and the crew showed up at the hospital, Seb was still getting resuscitated inside.

"How's Mr. Landon?" Jack asked.

Zaire gave him a complicated look. "Not good."

Kelsey walked over to Miley and asked softly, "Where's Nina and Bella?"

Miley shook her head. "Haven't seen Bella since it happened. Nina went to find Richard. He's got a lot of connections, so he should be able to track her down soon."

"How did this even happen?" Kelsey glanced at the operating room. "Everything was fine yesterday. Seb loves Bella so much; there's no way he'd cheat on her. Must be those paparazzi making stuff up for clicks."

Before Kelsey could finish, the elevator dinged.

Miley saw who stepped out and quickly pulled Kelsey, signaling her to zip it.

Kelsey turned, confused. A man and a woman stepped out. The guy was young, in a suit and glasses, and looked unfamiliar. But Kelsey recognized the woman. "Siena?"

Miley whispered, "She's the one from the news."

"What?" Kelsey was shocked. "No way! She's Seb's sister!"

Miley asked, "Biological?"

Kelsey fell silent.

Bradley, who was with Siena, pressed the doorbell of the operating room.

Soon, someone opened the door. "Are you Dr. Vaughn?"

"Yeah, that's me." Bradley nodded. "How's Mr. Landon?"

"Not good. The lead surgeon wants to discuss his treatment with you. Please come in."

Bradley nodded and stepped inside.

Siena tried to follow but was blocked by Jack. "You can't go in!"

Siena looked startled. "Jack, you must be misunderstanding me."

"I don't know why you're here," Jack said sternly, "But Mr. Landon definitely doesn't want to see you. Ms. Scott, you should leave."

Siena bit her lip and looked at Bradley.

Bradley said, "Jack, I brought her here."

Jack frowned, confused.

Bradley calmly said, "She's the key to Mr. Landon's unresolved issues."

Jack was taken aback. He got the weight of that statement and the significance of this key.

Bradley said, "Jack, if you trust me, let me take her in."

Jack hesitated but eventually lowered his hand.

The resuscitation lasted four hours, and Seb was finally wheeled out safely.

Everyone surged forward, only to see Seb, still out cold, tightly clutching Siena's hand, refusing to let go.

Miley frowned deeply at the sight.

Kelsey was also a bit upset, but she thought that Seb might not have been fully conscious and could have confused Siena with Isabella, so she decided to restrain herself.

For the next two weeks, Seb stayed in a coma.

With Seb out cold and Isabella missing, the wedding was off and became the hottest gossip in entertainment news.

Nina had asked Richard to find Isabella, but days went by with no word from him. Even his phone was unreachable.

Nina went to the casino but only found Michael.

Before she could say anything, Michael handed her a letter. "This is from Richard."

Without another word, Michael turned and left.

Nina opened the envelope; a card and a letter fell out.

The letter was short, just a few words: [Wait for me.]

Nina suddenly realized Richard might not be in Lakina anymore. She found Michael to ask for more info.

Michael was silent for a long time before slowly saying, "Richard has his reasons. Nina, I hope you can understand."

Nina frowned. She believed Richard had his reasons for leaving without a word, but what about Bella?

Before she could ask, Michael said, "Richard said he would find Isabella. Please don't worry."

Nina was speechless. She didn't know how to calm down.

Nina went to the hospital, hoping to see Esme and ask for her help. But when she arrived, she found that Elodie's floor had been cleared out. The medical staff told her, "Elodie has been discharged. She left last night."

Two weeks later, it was dinnertime, and the family was gathered around the table at the Jose Mansion, but no one was eating.

A heavy pall seemed to hang over everyone's heads, lingering incessantly, weighing down their spirits and utterly killing their appetites.

Sweetie's cries echoed, and Margaret came in holding Sweetie. "Sweetie seems sick. She hasn't been eating or sleeping well these past few days. However, the doctor said nothing's wrong; Sweetie must be missing her mom."

The atmosphere in the living room grew even heavier.

Kelsey stood up, walked over, and patted Sweetie's hand. "Let me hold her."

Margaret handed Sweetie to her.

Kelsey hadn't been holding her long before Sweetie started crying again.

While the family was busy comforting Sweetie, the hospital called. They said Seb had woken up.

Zaire stood up and grabbed his coat. "I'll go."

Nina also stood up. "I'll go too."

Kelsey quickly said, "Wait for me. I'll go with you."

Nina turned back, saw Sweetie in Kelsey's arms, and came back to take Sweetie. "We'll all go together."

###chapter 409 Amnesia

Nina had no clue why she decided to bring Sweetie along just as she was about to leave. Maybe she thought that after such a long nap, even if Seb couldn't see Isabella right away, seeing Sweetie might help calm him down a bit.

But when they opened the hospital room door and saw Siena bawling her eyes out in Seb's arms, Nina suddenly wanted to kick herself.

Kelsey was stunned for a moment, then she stepped forward and pulled Siena away. "Why are you still here?"

Siena bit her lip, looking at Seb with teary eyes, but didn't say a word.

Kelsey turned to Seb, fuming. "Seb, if Bella sees this, she'll be heartbroken!"

Seb lay on the hospital bed, a hint of confusion flashing in his empty eyes. "Who's Bella?"

His question brought silence to the room.

Zaire looked at Seb's pale face and seemed to realize something, his brows furrowing silently.

Nina stood to the side holding Sweetie, her face full of sarcasm.

Kelsey was in disbelief. "Seb, what's wrong with you? Bella is your fiancÃ©e!"

"FiancÃ©e?" Seb's expression went blank for a moment, then his brows furrowed deeply, and his face gradually contorted in pain.

"Seb, what's wrong?" Siena rushed over and stood in front of the bed. "Stop asking him. Seb just woke up; he's not in a good state right now."

At that moment, Bradley and Seb's doctor walked in.

After asking everyone to leave, Bradley and the doctor ran a bunch of tests on Seb.

"Amnesia?" Kelsey was shocked.

Her reaction was the most dramatic; everyone else looked grim.

"Yes." Bradley nodded. "Mr. Landon's brain was stimulated during treatment, which directly led to his amnesia."

Kelsey asked, "What does that mean? Is it permanent or temporary?"

"It's hard to say," Bradley replied, "But during my treatment of Mr. Landon, I found that Siena plays a role in his recovery."

Kelsey asked, "What do you mean by that?"

Bradley said, "Generally speaking, psychological healing methods can be stimulated by familiar people or objects. We've observed that Mr. Landon is most relaxed when he's with Siena. No one can say for sure whether his amnesia is temporary or permanent. To be safe, we need to restore his memory as soon as possible."

Kelsey finally understood. "So you mean that Siena needs to stay by Seb's side and spend a lot of time with him?"

Bradley nodded. "That's about right. For Mr. Landon, Siena is just a means of treatment, a medium to help him recover quickly."

"Nonsense!" Kelsey retorted angrily, "Seb is a family man. Everyone knows Siena has bad intentions. With Bella missing, it's already generous not to kick Siena out. How can we let her stay by Seb's side? That's insane!"

No one said a word. The silence pretty much meant everyone agreed with Kelsey.

Bradley paused for a moment, then said, "This is the quickest and best way to treat him. Mr. Jose, please think it over."

"No way!" Kelsey shot back. "The most important people in Seb's life are Bella and Sweetie. Who is Siena? I absolutely disagree!"

"Ms. Jose!" Siena dropped to her knees, crying. "His kindness towards me isn't romantic; it's because I remind him of his mother. In Seb's eyes, his mother is the most important person. Please, let me stay and take care of him and Sweetie. Once Seb gets better and Isabella comes back, I'll leave right away."

Kelsey snapped, "No way, don't think I don't know what you're up to! Bella left because of you. Do you still want to stay and keep ruining their relationship? Zaire, get Siena out of here as far as possible!"

Seb had come out of the hospital room and was now standing at the door of the medical office, speaking coldly, "I'd like to see who dares to take her away!"

"Seb," Siena called out.

Seb didn't look at anyone; he walked straight to Siena and extended his hand to her.

Siena was stunned for a moment, then she joyfully placed her hand in his.

Holding Seb's hand, Siena stood up amidst everyone's incredulous gazes. "Seb."

Seb tightened his grip on Siena's fingers, pulling her closer, and said in a low voice, "Don't worry. As long as I'm here, no one can make you leave."

"Okay." Siena was overjoyed inside.

It seemed Bradley hadn't lied to her; the hypnosis on Seb had worked.

In the past half month, while Seb was in a coma, Siena and Bradley hadn't been idle.

Almost every day, Bradley would come to hypnotize Seb. After half a month of hypnosis, part of Seb's memory had been erased. Now, Seb didn't remember who Isabella was; he only knew that Siena was a very important and indispensable part of his life!

"Seb, how can you do this to Bella?" Kelsey was almost in tears.

Seeing Seb and Siena holding hands tightly, Kelsey stepped forward, trying to pull Siena away and separate them.

But before Kelsey could act, Siena hid behind Seb in fear; Seb frowned deeply, pushing Kelsey away.

Seb's push was strong. Kelsey stumbled back several steps and was only able to stand steady with Jack's support.

Zaire couldn't stand it anymore and said, "Seb, the doctor said your brain was stimulated, and you have amnesia. You don't remember Isabella, but do you remember us?"

Seb's gaze swept around the room. "Of course. I remember."

"And her?" Zaire stepped aside slightly, revealing Nina holding Sweetie in front of Seb. "This is your daughter with Isabella, nicknamed Sweetie and formally named Stella Landon. Do you recall her?"

###chapter 410 Farewell

Nina turned Sweetie's face towards Seb. Sweetie was just the cutest little thing, with those big, bright eyes. She couldn't talk yet, but she was already stealing hearts left and right. Anyone who saw her would just melt.

Seb frowned, clearly not feeling the love. He barely glanced at Sweetie before asking, "You say this is my daughter. Who's the mom?"

Nina replied, "Isabella."

Seb's frown deepened. "Where is she?"

Nina said, "She disappeared after your accident."

Seb sneered. "So she's a heartless one, huh? I might've been in a coma, but I was aware. The one who stayed by my side, taking care of me, was Siena. If Isabella really cared, how could she vanish when I needed her most? I don't think she's missing. She saw me in trouble and just wanted to avoid it. Even if she comes back, I don't want her."

Before Seb could finish, Nina slapped him hard across the face.

Nina stood there, her hand stinging, eyes red with anger. "Seb, you've really changed."

Seb looked at her, annoyed and angry. "Jack, why are you just standing there? Call the cops and have her arrested!"

Jack was stunned. "Mr. Landon!"

Seb repeated, "I said call the cops!"

"Seb, do you really have to do this? Nina is my sister and Bella's too." Kelsey was crying now. She found Seb incredibly unfamiliar. Despite his amnesia, why did his temperament and personality seem completely different?

Jack stepped forward. "Mr. Landon."

Seb snapped, "Call the cops!"

"Seb, are you nuts?" Zaire was furious too. "Nina is my sister. How dare you call the cops!"

Seb just glanced at Zaire, then picked up his phone to call the police himself.

Zaire couldn't believe it. This wasn't a big deal, but if Seb did this, their friendship was over.

The old Seb was all about loyalty and relationships. But now, he was different.

Just as Seb was about to dial, Siena gently placed her hand over his. "Seb, maybe we should let it go. They're right; this won't look good if it blows up."

Seb looked at Siena for a few seconds, then put down his phone. "Alright."

He turned to everyone else. "For Siena's sake, I won't push this. Jack, show them out!"

With that, Seb took Siena's hand and walked out of the doctor's office.

Nina said nothing, holding Sweetie as she left.

"Nina." Kelsey hurried after her.

Zaire frowned, exchanged a look with Jack, and then left too.

From that moment on, Seb, with his lost memory, had cut himself off from everyone.

Late at night.

Margaret put on a coat and went downstairs for a drink of water, only to find Nina sitting on the sofa, lost in thought.

Margaret called, "Nina?"

"Mom." Nina snapped out of it and forced a smile.

Margaret sat down beside her, took her hand, and looked at her with concern. "Can't sleep?"

"Yeah." Nina nodded lightly.

Margaret sighed. "I can't sleep either. I don't know where Bella is or how she's doing. Everything was going so well, and they were about to get married. But now, everything is a mess. Seb and Bella have really had a rough time."

Nina was still fuming about what happened earlier. Just hearing Seb's name made her scowl. "I can't believe Seb's turned into such a jerk."

Even if Seb had lost his memory, he shouldn't have changed this much! He used to love Isabella so deeply; can love really just disappear because of some memory loss?

Margaret was just as confused. "Kelsey told me about Seb's situation as soon as she got back. Seb and Zaire have been tight since school. We never thought Seb would act like this. Is there some misunderstanding? Kelsey mentioned his adopted sister, Siena, has been taking care of him. Did she say something to him?"

Nina shook her head. "Even if Siena did say something, Seb's not a kid. He should know right from wrong. Today, it felt like he wanted to cut us off completely! He doesn't even want Sweetie."

Margaret sighed. "Maybe Zaire can handle this. Don't stress. I'll talk to him."

"No need," Nina said firmly. "If he doesn't want Sweetie, I do! It's better for her to be with me than with a heartless father."

Seeing Nina's tired face, Margaret asked, "Still no word from Richard?"

Nina shook her head, looking lost. "No."

Margaret and Nina chatted a bit more before heading to bed.

Lying in bed, Nina pulled out her phone, found Richard's number, and dialed it, but it was still unreachable.

She then opened WhatsApp and scrolled through their chat history.

Their conversations were full of sweet memories. When Richard was around, Nina didn't think much of it. Now that he was gone without a word, she felt a deep emptiness.

Suddenly, she heard a noise from the balcony, just like those nights when Richard would sneak in through her window.

Nina jumped out of bed, not even bothering with her slippers, and ran to the floor-to-ceiling window. She pulled back the curtains, but there was nothing outside but darkness.

The glass reflected her smiling face, which slowly faded in the dark, indifferent night.

Nina stood by the window for a while, then closed the curtain again.

What she didn't know was that if she had opened the window and stepped out, she would have seen Richard hiding nearby. He was saying a silent goodbye.

Looking at the sliver of light coming through the curtain, Richard's fingers gently brushed the glass as he whispered, "Nina, wait for me!"

A moment later, Richard climbed down from the balcony, his black clothes blending into the night.

The next morning, Nina went downstairs to find the whole family waiting for her in the dining room.

Seeing her come down, Kelsey smiled and said, "Nina, breakfast is ready."

Kelsey even glanced behind her.

Nina didn't know what Kelsey was looking at and instinctively turned to look, but there was nothing there.

She sat down at the table and picked up a spoon to drink her porridge. Kelsey asked, "Where's Richard? Is he still not up?"

Nina was stunned and looked up to meet the concerned eyes of her family. "Kelsey, what are you talking about?"

Kelsey smiled. "Richard came to see you last night; we all saw it on the surveillance. We thought we'd see you both come down together."

Nina's mind buzzed, and the next second, she almost flew up the stairs.

###chapter 411 Admitting Mistakes

As Nina pushed the door open, her heart nearly jumped out of her chest.

She rushed to the floor-to-ceiling window, yanked back the curtains, and stepped out onto the balcony. But all she found was warm sunlight.

A flower pot had fallen by the railing, shattered into pieces, with soil scattered everywhere. That must've been the noise she heard last night.

Nina walked over and squatted down to clean up. Her eyes landed on a footprint in the soil. Her fingers trembled slightly; Richard had definitely been here last night!

Footsteps echoed behind her; it was Kelsey who had followed her up. Kelsey asked, "Nina, Richard isn't here?"

Nina lowered her eyes and calmly cleaned up the flower pot, saying, "He was here, but he's gone now."

Even though Nina stayed quiet, Kelsey could still feel her sadness and disappointment. The words Kelsey wanted to say got swallowed back down.

This wave of sadness and disappointment hung over Nina all morning.

Today, a client was coming to order a full set of jewelry. After organizing all the documents, Nina sat at her desk, lost in thought.

It wasn't until Amy, the assistant, walked in and said, "Ms. Miller, the guests are here," that Nina snapped back to reality. She composed herself, adjusted her demeanor, and headed to the meeting room with the documents in hand.

This was the first order Nina and Isabella Jewelry had received since Harmony Jewelry had poached their clients. The client was wealthy, immediately ordering a full set of jewelry and offering a generous price. Nina had stayed up several nights for this deal, her eyes red from lack of sleep.

The client, Diana Simmons, was an affluent middle-aged woman with a gentle smile. Upon perusing the design proposals presented by Nina and her team, Diana was thoroughly satisfied. "Let's finalize it then. We can sign the contract today."

Nina and Amy were both taken aback. "So soon?"

Diana laughed. "You business folks, don't you want to sign the contract quickly and get the money as soon as possible?"

"Of course we do," Nina replied honestly. "But this isn't a small amount. If you need to think it over, I understand and can wait."

"No need." Diana said straightforwardly, "Just bring the contract, and I'll sign it."

Diana's straightforwardness made Nina wary. "What about the timeline?"

Diana said, "There are no strict requirements for the timeline. This set of jewelry is for an event abroad in six months, so you have plenty of time."

This customer was generous with payment, had minimal demands, and imposed no deadlines. Maybe because previous clients had been so difficult, encountering such a straightforward client made Nina hesitant to sign.

Diana seemed to read her thoughts and smiled. "You don't need to worry about me tricking you. I'm just a straightforward person who doesn't like to drag things out. Of course, if you insist on a reason, I can tell you."

Nina looked into her eyes.

Diana said, "Richard."

Nina was surprised. "You know Richard?"

Diana nodded. "We've been old friends for many years. He asked me to take care of your business."

Nina suddenly understood and breathed a sigh of relief. "So that's how it is."

Diana smiled. "So, can you sign the contract with me now without any worries?"

"Absolutely, I'm reassured!" Nina quickly told Amy to fetch the contract.

After both parties signed, making it official, Diana said, "I'll have my finance department send you the deposit once I get back. It's great to have reached this agreement. I can't wait to see what we achieve together."

"Thank you. Let's work together towards our goals," Nina replied.

Nina escorted Diana to the door and watched her car drive away. She then noticed a car parked across the street. The window was half-open, and inside sat an elegant lady wearing sunglasses and a hat. Even from a distance, Nina recognized her immediately-it was Ophelia.

Ophelia didn't stay long; the car soon drove off. So, Nina didn't think much of it.

After a busy day, as Nina walked into the underground parking lot with her bag, she saw Ophelia's car again, parked right next to hers.

The back window was still open, and Ophelia was no longer wearing sunglasses and a hat. Ophelia turned to Nina and said, "Ms. Miller, I have a few questions to ask you."

After a pause, Ophelia added, "Is it convenient?"

Nina noticed that Ophelia didn't seem as arrogant as before. She appeared strong, but inside, she was a mess.

"Sure," Nina nodded, walking over and unlocking her car door with the key.

After starting the car, Nina rolled down the window and said to Ophelia, "Have you had dinner?"

Ophelia shook her head.

Nina said, "I know a restaurant with pretty good food. How about we have a meal together there?"

"Okay." Ophelia nodded, instructing her driver to follow Nina's car.

Nina chose a serene, elegantly decorated restaurant.

Since she worried that Ophelia might find it hard to talk, Nina specifically chose a quieter private room upstairs. When ordering, Nina fully respected Ophelia's tastes.

Nina said, "You should try their tea; it's organically grown by the owner himself, completely natural, and free from pollutants. It's delightful for the appetite and digestion, with a subtle, delicate fragrance."

Ophelia looked at Nina and said, "I'm sorry, Ms. Miller. I take back what I said before. I admit I had a lot of prejudice against you and Isabella. It was all because of Emma."

Nina smiled gently. "That's how it is between people. They are either friendly or prejudiced. There's no need to take it too seriously, just as Bella and me."

A hint of admiration appeared in Ophelia's eyes. "I used to think you were fake, that everything you had was built by your family and men, yet you always put on a confident front. Now I see, I was too narrow-minded."

Ophelia smiled bitterly. "I've always mocked others, only to realize in the end that I'm the real clown!"

Sensing Ophelia's low mood, Nina asked, "If it's convenient, can you tell me about it? I may not be much help, but I can offer some comfort."

Ophelia glanced at Nina, then quickly lowered her eyes as if finding it hard to speak.

Nina didn't rush her; she patiently waited for Ophelia to open up, making small talk in the meantime.

Gradually, Ophelia relaxed and got to the point. "I checked what you told me last time. There was indeed something added to those perfumes."

###chapter 412 Analysis

Nina wasn't shocked at all and asked, "You must be really upset after finding out the truth."

"Yeah, I'm super upset." Ophelia tried to smile but couldn't. "Vilma is my only niece, and I see her like my own daughter. But she's hurt me so badly behind my back. It's just unbelievable!"

Nina asked, "Did you confront her?"

"No." Ophelia shook her head, her eyes filled with even more pain. "I was going to, but then I found out my husband was cheating on me."

This was something Nina never saw coming.

Ophelia continued, "At first, I noticed some big transfers. I got suspicious and had someone look into it. Turns out, all the money was going to Vilma. Plus, he was sending her money every month. I found out he had a dual system on his phone, and in the other system..."

Ophelia choked up, struggling to continue.

"They're so disgusting!" Ophelia almost ground her teeth to pieces.

There was probably nothing worse than being betrayed by the people you trusted the most.

Nina stayed quiet for a long time after hearing this.

Nina poured Ophelia several glasses of water and watched her drink them. After Ophelia had calmed down a bit, Nina asked, "So what are you gonna do next?"

Since Ophelia had come to her, it was clear things hadn't completely fallen apart yet. Ophelia knew the truth but had chosen to endure it for various reasons.

"I don't know." Ophelia shook her head in pain, covering her face with her hands and sobbing. "One is my husband, and the other is my niece. I never imagined they would get involved with each other. Now, just thinking about Vilma makes me sick! What's even more ridiculous is that I found out my friends all knew about this; they were always laughing at me behind my back; they never warned me or told me anything. Once, at a gathering, I hid on purpose and overheard them mocking me loudly and sarcastically."

Ophelia continued, "I can't imagine how smug they would be if I fell out with Nathaniel; how they would laugh at me behind my back! They would definitely laugh and say, 'Look, Ophelia used to be so proud, and now she's been kicked out by her husband!' I don't want that. And my son! He's so young and outstanding; his life is just beginning. How can he have such a disgraceful stain?"

Ophelia shook her head as she spoke.

Ophelia's thoughts were firm; she knew she couldn't fall out with Nathaniel. At the same time, Ophelia was also very distraught. She couldn't confront them, but she couldn't endure it either. Ophelia was torturing herself to the point of being unrecognizable in this situation.

"So, have you decided to pretend none of this ever happened and continue to be someone who turns a blind eye?" Nina asked.

Ophelia still shook her head. "I don't know."

At that moment, the waiter came to serve the food.

Nina handed her a box of tissues and said, "Go wash your face first. Then let's eat and talk. Only when you're full can your mind be active."

Ophelia took the tissue box and went to the restroom. Then they started eating.

There wasn't much conversation, and the atmosphere was relatively calm.

Ophelia thought she wouldn't be able to eat because she hadn't slept well or eaten properly for days. Even though Ophelia felt dizzy, she didn't feel hungry. But after finishing her meal, Ophelia realized she had eaten all the food in front of her, and even wanted some dessert.

Nina looked at Ophelia and said slowly, "Wanna hear my story?"

Ophelia asked, "Yours?"

"Yeah." Nina nodded and started her tale.

Nina talked about her first awful marriage.

Those days were dark, and Nina once lacked the courage to leave. Even though she knew deep down that Charlie wasn't someone she could spend her life with, and Isabella had advised her many times to get a divorce, Nina never had the guts to take that step. Until things got worse than she ever imagined, and after a miscarriage, Nina finally found the courage to take the first step. That step allowed Nina to escape the darkness and slowly walk into the light.

Nina said, "Sometimes, people know exactly what they want. But because of various reasons in real life, they have to compromise, especially in marriage. I think if you can really endure it, or if you feel you can't let go of this marriage, you can try to see."

Ophelia's eyes gradually cleared, and she nodded. "You're right. I can endure Nathaniel, but Vilma has to get out of Lakina!"

When Vilma came to Lakina, she had nothing.

It was Ophelia who convinced Nathaniel to invest money, effort, and connections to help Vilma open a store and pave the way for her.

Whenever Ophelia thought of how she had devoted herself wholeheartedly, only to be betrayed by Vilma, she felt an overwhelming sense of indignation. Ophelia wanted Vilma out of Lakina with nothing, just as she had come!

Ophelia's eyes became determined. She wiped away her tears and said, "Nina, thanks for listening to me. After talking to you, I feel much lighter and more aware of what I should do."

Nina smiled slightly. "The only person who can help you is yourself. I believe that as long as we become strong, all external harm will dissipate effortlessly."

Ophelia said, "Yeah, you're right. I can't let two scumbags bring me down. I have to handle all this and wait for my son to come back!"

After that, Nina didn't see Ophelia for quite some time.

Until one day, Vilma came looking for her.

Vilma barged in directly. "Where's Nina? I want to see her; get her out here!"

Nina was in a group meeting at the time, and the people outside couldn't stop Vilma, who burst in.

"Nina, you ruined me!" Vilma screamed and rushed over. She took something out of her bag, and a wet substance sprayed all over Nina and the people next to her.

"Blood, it's blood!" Amy was terrified. She was sitting next to Nina and instinctively stood up, shielding Nina from most of it. Now Amy was covered in blood; the smell was particularly pungent and unpleasant.

Amy was really scared, thinking it might be acid.

The people swiftly passed tissues to aid Amy and Nina in wiping off the blood.

Vilma was also restrained and handed over to the security guards who arrived later.

Vilma struggled and screamed like a madwoman. "Nina, you despicable person, how dare you accuse me of seducing Nathaniel? You've ruined me, and I won't let you get away with it!"

Nina frowned at her words and met Vilma's furious eyes calmly. "Vilma, you know very well whether you did such things or not."

Vilma spat on the ground. "Do you think you can bring me down like this? Who does Ophelia think she is? Just wait; I'll settle this score with you sooner or later!"

Nina was amused. "Alright, I'll be waiting for you."

###chapter 413 The Living Dead

So, after Vilma got kicked out that day, she went straight to Ophelia's place and made a scene at Nathaniel's office. But in the end, it was all for nothing.

In this messed-up love triangle, Nathaniel ended up choosing Ophelia.

Nathaniel wasn't hesitant to leave Ophelia, nor did he care about the gossip. If he could pull off such a shady move, those things didn't even cross his mind. To be blunt, it was all about the perks; Nathaniel wasn't about to give up the money and status.

Once everything settled down, Ophelia invited Nina out for dinner.

This time, Ophelia looked radiant, though you could still see some tiredness in her eyes. She was on cloud nine because she had won.

Ophelia said, "I knew Nathaniel wouldn't pick her. The adult world is brutal; it's all about money and women, such practical choices. When she decided to mess around with Nathaniel, wasn't it because of his power and money? If we go back a few decades, when Nathaniel was just a poor kid who came to Lakina with his family's hopes, would Vilma have even looked at him?"

Nina just listened as Ophelia went on and on.

Having gotten her revenge and seeing Vilma leave empty-handed, Ophelia felt thrilled but also kind of empty.

When Ophelia finally stopped talking, Nina asked, "Are you happy?"

Ophelia was taken aback. She looked at Nina, and in that moment, all her bravado crumbled.

"Nina, you see right through me!" Ophelia said, then she grabbed the glass of whiskey on the table and downed it in one go.

She asked the bartender for three more drinks, like she was trying to numb herself, and drank them all in one go.

When Ophelia tried to keep drinking, Nina reached out to stop her and said to the bartender, "Can we get a glass of water, please? Thanks."

Ophelia's eyes were a bit red. She chuckled lightly and said, "You're right. I won, but I don't feel happy at all. In fact, I feel exhausted and disgusted. Why do I have to deal with such awful people in this world, such morally bankrupt scum?"

Nina lowered her eyes, took the glass of water from the bartender, and pushed it in front of Ophelia, speaking softly, "If you're not happy, you can always choose again."

Ophelia shook her head, gripping the glass tightly. "Nina, I can't get a divorce. Everything Nathaniel has is because of me; he owes it all to my parents. If I divorce him now, I'll be the one who loses. The tree I planted, am I supposed to just hand it over to someone else when it's finally bearing fruit? I can't do it!"

Nina sighed. "But now, you might never go back to the way things were; even if you have to face resentment for the rest of your life, will you still stick with this marriage?"

Ophelia nodded, a hint of stubbornness in her eyes. "Even if I die, I'll drag Nathaniel down with me. I absolutely won't let anyone take away the fruits of my hard work!"

Nina wanted to persuade her.

Even without Vilma, there would be other women for Nathaniel. The real problem wasn't Vilma; it was Nathaniel. If things kept going like this, Ophelia would only suffer more in the future.

Seeing Ophelia's current state, Nina figured her friend probably wouldn't listen to any advice right now, so she decided to just wait and see.

Silvercrest.

Isabella woke up from a nap and found herself in a completely white room.

Everything was white-the walls, the ceiling, the bed, even the sheets.

Isabella had just woken up, but her head felt like it was about to explode, especially her temples.

She pushed herself up with her arms, struggling to sit up. On the opposite wall, a mirror was perfectly aligned with her. As she sat up, she saw her reflection and realized she was wearing a white hospital gown.

Looking around, Isabella saw she was in a sterile room, lying on a hospital bed with heavy medical equipment beside it, separated by a curtain.

The equipment was making noises, but weirdly, none of it was connected to her.

Isabella's eyes followed the lines from the machines, tracing them to where they extended beyond the curtain.

Suddenly, she had a flash of insight. She leaned over, grabbed the corner of the curtain, and slowly lifted it.

Another hospital bed came into view, with the bedding slightly bulging. Looking further up, Isabella saw a frail wrist, skeletal and thin, with numerous tubes inserted. Even the fingers were bound with various devices.

When the curtain was fully lifted, Isabella could see the person lying on the bed clearly. Rather than calling it a person, it looked more like a pitiful skeleton!

Its face was emaciated beyond recognition, with sunken cheeks and eye sockets. The person had no hair, but from the facial features, Isabella could vaguely tell it was a woman!

Isabella's eyes widened in shock; a name instinctively came out of her mouth, "Lova?"

Lova didn't respond, only half-opening her eyes, looking at her like a dried-up corpse.

If it weren't for the real-time display of Lova's heartbeat and other vital signs on the nearby equipment, Isabella would have thought Lova was already dead!

At that moment, the door swung open, and a group of people in white lab coats and masks, fully equipped, entered the room. Some were carrying medical trays; others had white medical boxes. They looked like those scientists doing biochemical experiments in TV shows.

Isabella instinctively backed away, but two people grabbed her from both sides and pressed her down on the bed.

She reacted a beat too late and started to struggle. "Let go of me!"

The next second, a needle pricked Isabella's neck, bringing a sharp pain and numbness. Soon, her arms and body lost all sensation.

Isabella was forced be lifted onto the bed by those people . They opened the medical box and took out blood-drawing tools. They tied her arm with a rubber band, pierced her skin with a needle, and started drawing blood.

The whole process lasted about five minutes, and they drew over a dozen tubes of blood before they were satisfied and let her go.

Just as quickly as they had arrived, they left, carrying their medical kits with them.

###chapter 414 Playing Dumb

The hospital room was empty except for Isabella and Lova.

Isabella, not sure if it was the anesthesia kicking in or the recent blood draw, felt a wave of dizziness hit her. In no time, Isabella was out cold. When she woke up, the sky outside was pitch black.

Isabella stared at the ceiling for a few seconds, then something clicked. She turned her head and locked eyes with Lova's lifeless gaze.

Isabella's heart skipped a beat, and suddenly she heard a voice. "You're awake."

Isabella shifted her gaze and noticed someone else in the room. She slowly sat up; the dizziness was gone, but her limbs felt weak, and she was a bit nauseous.

Quentin walked over, pulled up a small table, and unscrewed a thermos. "I brought you some food."

Isabella was hungry, but she had no appetite, especially for the food he brought. She stared at Quentin and asked, "Quentin, are you really planning to use my life to save Lova's?"

"Yes." Quentin stirred the porridge in the bowl with a spoon and said calmly, "I've been planning this for a year. Everything's ready now, so don't even think about running; you can't escape."

Even though he was talking about taking a life, Quentin seemed indifferent, like he was discussing the weather. He brought a spoonful of porridge to Isabella's mouth.

Isabella angrily pushed Quentin's arm away, the spoon falling into the bowl and splashing porridge onto Quentin's collar.

"Quentin, you're a madman!" Isabella snapped.

Quentin frowned, wiped the porridge off his collar, and calmly placed the bowl on the small table. "The porridge is still hot; you can wait a bit before eating."

With that, Quentin got up to leave.

Isabella suddenly got up from the hospital bed, placing her hand on Lova's oxygen mask. "Quentin, let me go, or I'll make Lova die right in front of you!"

Quentin's eyes darkened. "Bella, do you think I'd put you and Lova together without any precautions?"

Quentin clapped his hands twice, and someone came in from outside immediately.

It was two people in white coats, restraining another person in a white coat.

All three were fully equipped; Isabella didn't understand what they were doing.

Quentin stepped forward and tore off the mask of the restrained person.

Isabella saw the person's face clearly and was stunned. "Marvin?"

Marvin gritted his teeth and said to Quentin, "You discovered me long ago?"

Quentin threw away Marvin's mask and said nonchalantly, "If you weren't useful, do you think you could have infiltrated the lab so easily?"

Isabella understood.

Previously, it was said that Seb had sent Marvin on a business trip, but where he went was a mystery. Isabella wondered why everything was so secretive; it turned out Marvin had come to Silvercrest and even found a way into Quentin's lab. So, Seb had long suspected Quentin's motives and sent Marvin to investigate. But clearly, this place was far more complicated than they had imagined. Marvin was able to get in because Quentin allowed it; it was likely that Marvin had never been unable to relay the message.

"Bella, I told you, don't think about escaping. If anything happens to Lova, everyone related to you will be buried with her!" Quentin said in the calmest tone.

Isabella knew Quentin could pull it off!

Her fingers slowly let go of the oxygen mask, and Quentin walked over. "Bella, be good and eat your food."

Isabella looked at him. "I want to see my mom!"

Quentin stared at her for a moment and finally nodded. "Okay."

Seb woke up from a nightmare, drenched in sweat.

Siena opened the door and came in. "Seb, what's wrong?"

Through the darkness, Siena sat on the edge of the bed and hugged Seb. As he smelled Siena's scent, Seb frowned deeply. He raised his hand to rub his forehead but didn't speak.

Seeing that Seb didn't push her away, Siena gathered her courage, cupped his face with both hands and said, "Seb, did you have another nightmare? It's been so long, and it hasn't gotten any better. Should I call Dr. Vaughn to come and check on you?"

Saying that, Siena was about to make the call.

Seb suddenly reached out and grabbed her wrist. "It's so late; let's not bother Bradley."

Siena said, "But you don't look well."

Bradley had repeatedly instructed that if Seb felt any physical discomfort, Siena should call him immediately. Everything Siena had now was given by Bradley, so she listened to him very much.

Moreover, Siena was also afraid that Seb might remember something or someone from his dreams, which could trigger him.

"I'm fine." Seb pulled Siena to sit down. "I just have a headache. Can you get me some painkillers?"

"Okay." Siena quickly found the painkillers and watched Seb take them with water. "Do you feel better, Seb?"

"Yes." Seb still held Siena's hand. "Siena, don't go. Stay here with me."

Siena felt sweet inside and nodded in agreement. "Okay. I won't go. Rest easy; I will stay by your side throughout the night."

Seb lay down; Siena sat by the bed, holding Seb's hand tightly with both hands.

Under the light, Siena stared at Seb's face with some infatuation.

When Seb's breathing became even, and he seemed to be deeply asleep, Siena also felt a bit sleepy and fell asleep by the bedside.

As soon as Siena closed her eyes, Seb silently opened his.

He retrieved a towel from under the pillow and gently placed it over Siena's nose and mouth.

The ether on the towel evaporated, all of it carried into Siena's breath, and soon she drifted into a deep sleep.

Seb threw the towel away and got up to the balcony. Then he dialed Zaire's number.

"I knew you were faking it!" Zaire wasn't surprised at all. "What are you planning to do?"

Seb said, "Siena is their spy placed by my side. For Bella's safety, I can't move Siena for now. Zaire, you better find a way to get to Silvercrest."

Zaire said, "Even if you hadn't mentioned it, I was planning to go there soon. Quentin must have taken Isabella back. Don't worry. I will undoubtedly help you find Isabella!"

Seb shook his head. "Don't look for Isabella; find Marvin first."

"Marvin?" This time, Zaire was completely confused.

Seb said, "Yes. I sent him to Silvercrest a month ago, and then he lost contact. I have an address here. If Marvin found anything, he would leave traces there. I can't go there for now, so I have to ask you."

Zaire nodded. "Okay. I'll go. And you?"

Seb said, "I'll stay here and continue pretending; I need to keep Siena in check."

Zaire was silent for a while and then he said, "You better keep it together. If you do anything to hurt Bella, I won't be able to help you then."

Seb said, "Don't worry."

###chapter 415  Meeting

Isabella had to swap blood with Lova, so she was on this strict porridge diet to clear out impurities. She couldn't eat much and was visibly losing weight.

Since that day, she hadn't seen Marvin, and Quentin was a no-show too.

Other than someone bringing Isabella her meals and doctors checking on Lova, no one else came into the room. Isabella felt totally cut off from the world.

At first, she barely moved around; the curtain between the two hospital beds was always closed because she didn't want to see Lova!

Eventually, Isabella got braver and pulled the curtain open. Sometimes, she'd just stand there, staring at Lova.

Lova wasn't dead, but Isabella thought her situation was worse than death.

From the looks of it, Lova had been stuck in that bed for years.

Isabella had only been confined for a few days and was already losing it. She couldn't imagine how awful it must be for Lova to be trapped here for so long, completely cut off from the outside world.

If it were Isabella, she'd go nuts!

Lova had to stay here all day and night, unable to move or speak. The only things she could do were move her eyes and breathe.

Right now, Lova seemed to be asleep, her eyes closed.

Isabella stood by the bed, watching her. After a bit, Lova suddenly opened her eyes and stared right at Isabella.

Before, Isabella would've been freaked out by Lova's stare.

But now, maybe because she was used to it or because of the suffocating environment, Isabella didn't find it so scary. At least she could still move, but Lova was stuck lying there day after day.

Isabella sat down on a chair. After thinking for a moment, she said, "Hey, I'm Isabella Miller."

Lova didn't respond.

Isabella asked, "I don't know if you can hear me. If you can, could you blink?"

Lova just stared blankly.

Isabella waited but still didn't see Lova blink.

She sighed. "You must be exhausted living like this, huh? Quentin said he wants to take my life to save yours. I think he's a monster. He must be quite twisted to come up with such a crazy plan."

"Oh, by the way, we're actually sisters. Based on our ages, I'm your big sister," Isabella said with a bitter smile. "I just never thought we'd meet like this."

Isabella kept talking, not noticing the change in Lova's eyes.

A flicker of emotion appeared in Lova's previously lifeless eyes, like a dead tree slowly coming back to life.

The medical equipment suddenly started beeping urgently. Isabella looked up and saw the previously stable lines going wild.

Lova's breathing became erratic. Her frail chest heaved; it seemed like she wanted to get up but couldn't. After a few seconds of struggle, Lova fell back heavily onto the bed.

Isabella watched in shock as Lova grabbed her wrist with a thin, misshapen hand.

Freaked out, Isabella shook off Lova's hand and backed away. She was genuinely terrified that Lova might rise like a mummy from a horror film and drain her blood.

Just then, the door burst open, and a group of doctors rushed in, quickly wheeling Lova's stretcher out.

Still in shock, Isabella saw Quentin arrive.

Quentin grabbed her shoulders, his eyes blazing with anger. "What did you say to Lova? Why did her emotions suddenly go haywire? Isabella, I told you to behave; why won't you listen?"

Isabella was so shaken by Quentin that she almost couldn't stand. She tried to break free, but Quentin held her arm tightly.

A doctor approached, speaking quickly, "Ms. Black's condition is very bad."

Quentin's eyes darkened, and he said without hesitation, "Prepare for the blood exchange surgery immediately."

The doctor said, "But the blood we transfused earlier hasn't been fully tested. What if there's a rejection reaction?"

"We can't worry about that now!" Quentin snapped. "Get everything ready. I'll perform the surgery myself."

The doctor hesitated but eventually went to make the arrangements.

Soon, two doctors came in, gave Isabella a sedative, and laid her on a stretcher, tying her hands and feet.

Isabella saw people gathering around her bed, starting to prepare for the surgery. The surgical light above her was turned on, making it hard for her to keep her eyes open. The sound of surgical instruments clinking filled the room, and the temperature kept dropping, causing Isabella to shiver uncontrollably.

"Lova, my daughter." A familiar voice broke through the noise.

Isabella was startled and turned her head, slowly opening her eyes.

Lova was wheeled back in and placed next to Isabella's bed. They were even closer than before. She could almost reach out and touch Lova's hand.

At this moment, the person crying by the bedside was none other than Isabella's mother, Esme, whom she had been longing to see.

Even though Isabella was lying right there, Esme seemed not to notice her, her entire focus on Lova.

Isabella's heart ached.

"Mom," Isabella called out softly.

Esme paused and looked up. When her eyes met Isabella's tear-filled gaze, she hesitated.

Isabella saw a flash of conflict in Esme's eyes. Then Esme wiped her tears and walked over to Isabella's bed.

"Bella," Esme said, holding her hand, her face showing a hint of guilt. "I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."

Isabella's mind went blank, and her heart sank.

She had requested to see Esme, as she viewed Esme as her last hope. If Esme was willing to save her, she would have a chance to live.

Esme couldn't bear to meet Isabella's eyes. She pressed her forehead against Isabella's hand, tears falling uncontrollably. "I'm sorry, Bella. It's my fault. I don't expect you to forgive me in this life. Even if I go to hell, I will accept my punishment."

###chapter 416 Being Abandoned Once Again

Isabella felt something wet on the back of her hand, and her heart sank.

Everyone was fussing over Lova in the next bed.

Isabella shut her eyes and whispered, "Mom, I don't want to die."

Esme just cried.

Isabella stared at the ceiling, tears streaming down her face. "I still have Sweetie, Seb, and Nina. They're waiting for me, Mom."

"Bella," Esme's voice cracked. "I'm sorry."

"Mom, I'm your daughter too. You left me once. Are you going to do it again?" Isabella's tears fell like rain, her heart breaking.

Esme kept saying, "Bella, I'm sorry."

Isabella closed her eyes. Esme had apologized like this before, and Isabella had forgiven her, thinking it would make things right. She didn't want her mom to live with guilt.

But now, Isabella realized Esme's apologies were just words to ease her own guilt. They weren't for Isabella; they were for Esme. How fake and disgusting.

Isabella didn't want to talk anymore. She pulled her hand away. "Go. I never want to see you again."

"Bella," Esme's lips trembled, her face full of pain.

But Isabella didn't look back.

Quentin came over and helped the shaky Esme out. "Mom, sit here for a bit. The surgery will be over soon."

Esme grabbed Quentin's hand. "Quentin, what are the chances? Can Lova get better? Does Bella have to die? Is there no other way?"

Quentin paused, patted Esme's hand, and said, "I'm confident. Mom, if Lova can get better, it's worth it. Bella is her sister, even if they didn't grow up together. If it were Nina, Bella would do the same."

Esme's expression softened a bit.

Quentin continued, "Mom, Lova has suffered so much. If we give up now, what was all her suffering for? You saw Lova. Did you see the hope in her eyes? Isabella is her only hope. Are you going to take that away?"

Esme's heart ached. "No. But Bella..."

Quentin said, "Whether the surgery works or not, I'll make it up to Bella. If she dies, I'll bring Sweetie to Silvercrest. Lova and I will raise Sweetie as our own. What we couldn't give Isabella, we'll give to Sweetie tenfold. We'll make her the happiest girl. You can help raise her too. It'll be a way to make up for Isabella."

Esme said nothing, just looked at Quentin. "Quentin, you have to save Lova!"

Quentin sighed in relief. "Don't worry. I want Lova to live more than anyone!"

A doctor walked over. "Mr. Black, everything's set. We're just waiting on you."

"Got it," Quentin nodded. "Mom, I'm going to start Lova's surgery now. You'll see her soon."

With that, Quentin turned and left.

Esme was in a daze for a moment, then she got up and followed. "Quentin, I want to watch. Let me go with you."

Quentin frowned. "Mom, it's best if you don't."

He refused her and instructed someone nearby, "Take care of Mrs. Black."

As Esme watched Quentin walk into the operating room, and then the door closed, she took a couple of shaky steps back and almost fell.

One of Quentin's men said, "Mrs. Black, please sit and wait. The surgery will be quick."

Esme sat on the bench, but her mind was filled with the image of Bella crying and begging her. "Mom, I don't want to die."

"Bella, Bella," Esme started crying again.

"Administer the anesthesia."

"Blood pressure normal, heart rate normal, pulse normal, the surgery can begin."

Isabella lay on the hospital bed, listening to the people around her chattering like they were counting numbers.

Quentin had already changed into a white coat; he was taller and more prominent than everyone else. He bent down, his gloved hand gently caressing Lova's cheek. "Lova, welcome back."

Suddenly, Quentin felt a gaze on him. He looked up and met Isabella's eyes.

Isabella stared at him. "Quentin, I will remember your face. Even after I die, I won't let you go!"

Quentin frowned. Isabella's gaze made him feel uncomfortable, like he was being skinned alive.

Quentin said nothing and told the anesthetist, "You can anesthetize her now."

The anesthetist walked over with the syringe and injected the anesthetic into Isabella's vein.

Under the drug's effect, Isabella blacked out within seconds, losing all consciousness.

The anesthetist said, "Mr. Black, we can start now."

"Okay." Quentin pulled up his mask, but at that moment, a hand grabbed his pinky finger.

Quentin looked down. First, he saw the emaciated hand, merely skin and bone, and then, following the line of that hand upwards, he met Lova's eyes. "Lova?"

Years later, he finally saw a spark in Lova's eyes, which had been dull before.

Quentin was a bit emotional. He held Lova's hand tightly. "Lova, do you recognize me?"

Under the oxygen mask, Lova moved her mouth slightly, making no sound, but it was a response to Quentin.

Quentin was almost in tears with joy. "I knew it. My decision was right. Lova, don't worry. I will save you!"

He was full of confidence, but Lova slowly shook her head.

Lova's outstretched finger wrote a single word on Quentin's hand: [No.]

Quentin's pupils contracted sharply. "You refuse the surgery?"

Lova slowly closed her eyes.

Quentin refused her, "Lova, you must have this surgery! I've prepared too long for this day. I can't give up now. Lova, hold on. The surgery will be quick."

Lova closed her eyes in disappointment, a tear sliding down her cheek.

Quentin kissed away her tear, then he stood up, his voice more determined than before. "Start the surgery!"

###chapter 417 Gone Mad

The blood transfusion device had one end stuck in Isabella's arm and the other in Lova's.

As soon as the machine kicked in, bright red blood started flowing through the clear tube, slowly making its way into Lova's frail body.

Lova took one last look at Isabella before she closed her eyes.

Suddenly, the door flew open, and Esme burst in. "Quentin, don't kill Bella. Please, don't!"

Quentin frowned and blocked her. "Mom, we agreed on this. How can we back out now?"

Esme clung to Quentin's arm, tears streaming down her face. "Quentin, I love Lova, but Bella is my child too! How can we sacrifice Bella to save Lova? If Lova were awake, she'd never agree to this! Quentin, I'm begging you, let Bella go. She has a husband, a child. She's already been through so much. Her happy life is just beginning; why would we mess that up?"

Esme sobbed as she knelt on the floor.

Quentin looked down at her, emotionless, and let out a cold snort. "Mom, you say you love Lova, but you're willing to abandon her now? Anyone can give up on her, but I won't.To save Lova, I'll do whatever it takes."

Esme was furious. "Quentin, how can you?"

Quentin cut her off. "Mom, it's done. No one can stop me today!"

He signaled to someone nearby, and two people stepped forward, grabbing Esme by the arms and dragging her out.

Suddenly, a piercing alarm cut through the room. "Something's wrong! Mr. Black, Ms. Black has no heartbeat!"

Quentin spun around, eyes narrowing as he saw the flat line on the monitor. He rushed to the bedside; a doctor noticed something and lifted Lova's right hand that had fallen off the bed. "Mr. Black!"

In Lova's hand was the tube supplying her with oxygen. At some point, she had secretly pulled it out.

After years of illness, regular air felt like knives to Lova; just a few breaths would make her throat feel like it was being cut. Without the oxygen, she would suffocate in just two minutes. Two minutes ago, Lova had clutched Quentin's hand, begging him not to go through with the surgery, but he had refused. So, Lova chose this way to refuse.

"Lova, Lova!" Quentin bent down, trying to lift her, but her frail frame left him unsure where to start.

An assistant reconnected the oxygen tube and said, "Mr. Black, now's not the time to be sad. We need to resuscitate her quickly; Ms. Black still has a chance!"

"Right, right!" Quentin, snapping back to reality, immediately began a series of resuscitation measures on Lova.

"Lova, Lova," Esme cried out, terrified.

Even though Lova had been in this half-dead state for years, and Esme had long been prepared to lose her, seeing Lova's heartbeat flatline still broke her.

Quentin had no time to pay attention to Esme; he was entirely focused on saving Lova.

They used CPR and a cardiac pacemaker. During the critical golden hour, Lova's heartbeat finally showed a faint return. Her heart started beating again.

Quentin carefully picked up Lova and gently kissed her forehead. "Lova, don't be foolish. I won't let you leave me!"

One doctor said, "Mr. Black, Ms. Black's heartbeat is very unstable. She seems to have no will to live. If this continues, the situation will be dire."

Quentin gritted his teeth and glanced at Isabella on the nearby bed.

The blood transfusion procedure needed seven hours to completely exchange the blood between Lova and Isabella.

But now, only a few minutes had passed. This small amount of blood was far from enough to pull Lova back from the brink of death! If Lova were conscious, he could hypnotize her to restore her will to live.

"Quentin," Esme was still crying, but her emotions had gradually calmed down. "Quentin, let Lova go. She's in so much pain."

Quentin looked up, his eyes bloodshot. "I won't let her go, even if she dies!"

"Quentin." Esme shook her head, unable to comprehend Quentin's madness.

Lova was clearly on her last legs and had lost the will to live. Why was Quentin so fixated?

Esme had always known Quentin and Lova had a deep bond, but she didn't realize that after all these years, Quentin's feelings were still so intense.

One doctor said, "Ms. Black's heartbeat is getting weaker! Mr. Black, should we stop the transfusion? If this continues, both of them might die!"

Esme looked at Quentin anxiously, waiting for him to speak.

This research facility belonged to Quentin, and everyone only listened to him.

Whether Isabella could survive depended entirely on whether Quentin still had a shred of humanity left.

Quentin held Lova for a moment, then he spoke, "Stop it!"

Esme breathed a sigh of relief. "Quentin, thank you."

Quentin glanced at her. "No need to thank me. The blood transfusion is stopped, but I just thought of another surgery."

Esme was stunned. "What surgery? Lova is already so weak. Quentin, she can't take any more."

Quentin's hand gently caressed Lova's cheek, a faint smile on his lips. His gaze appeared tender, yet that tenderness seemed to be laced with poison. The words that flowed from Quentin's mouth were even more chilling and heart-wrenching.

Quentin said, "I want to take Lova's heart and put it into Isabella's body."

As these words were uttered, not only was Esme shocked, but the assistants nearby were also left utterly stunned. This was a crazy idea!

Quentin held Lova's fingers and said, "I didn't think it through. Lova values beauty so much that even if we transfused all of Isabella's blood to her, she might still struggle to accept her appearance when she wakes up. But it's okay; I can swap their hearts. This way, Lova can continue to live and still be beautiful."

Quentin's face was filled with a kind of madness.

For Lova's rebirth, Quentin was no longer just obsessed; he was on the verge of insanity.

"Quentin," Esme wanted to say something, but someone suddenly rushed in, urgently saying, "Mr. Black, Marvin has escaped!"

Quentin's eyes narrowed. "Let him run; why panic?"

The person said, "But didn't you say before..."

"It's not important now." Quentin put Lova down. "Prepare for a heart transplant for Lova!"

Quentin paused, then he looked at Esme. "Mom, you should go back and wait for my news."

###chapter 418 Wade

Marvin made a break for Silvercrest, but he was stuck with nowhere to go and too scared to wander around. The Black Family had way too much power, and Marvin had no clue how far their reach went. If they caught him, it'd be game over.

Right now, Marvin needed to focus on staying safe. The only thing he could trust was the address Seb had given him before he left.

By the time Marvin got there, it was already dark.

He hid in the shadows, watching for over an hour. Only when he was sure everything was clear did he dare to go and open the door. Seb had given him the password, and he remembered it well.

As soon as he got the door open and stepped inside, the lights flicked on, and Marvin was suddenly forced to kneel.

Marvin's heart raced. He thought, 'The Black Family found me!' But then, the hands on his shoulders let go.

A pair of shiny men's leather shoes appeared right in front of him. Marvin looked up and saw a familiar face.

For a moment, Marvin was stunned, thinking he was seeing things. How could Zaire be here?

"What, don't recognize me?" Zaire said, clearly amused by Marvin's expression.

Marvin finally snapped out of it and jumped up. "Mr. Jose, it's really you. I'm not dreaming, right?"

"It's me," Zaire replied, just as Marvin hugged him tightly.

"You scared the hell out of me. I thought the Black Family had me!" Marvin said, almost in tears.

"Alright, that's enough," Zaire said, barely holding back a laugh. He patted Marvin's shoulder. "You're actually crying, man? What a softie!"

Marvin shot back, "Shut up! It was scary as hell, okay?"

Zaire handed him a box of tissues. "Just tell me, where's Isabella now?"

Marvin quickly straightened up. "At Quentin's research institute."

"Specific address?" Zaire asked.

Marvin nodded. "I can find the way, but..."

"But what?" Zaire pressed.

"But we might not be able to get in," Marvin admitted.

"I've already contacted the local police. They'll go with us. Is Isabella okay?" Zaire asked.

Marvin shook his head. "She's probably not doing well."

Quentin, not being a heart specialist, had called in the famous heart transplant surgeon, Loren Schneider, to do the surgery.

During the operation, Quentin was supposed to be there. But then, Bruno called and asked him to come back immediately.

Quentin could defy anyone but not Bruno.

The research institute was full of Quentin's people, and Loren was an old friend. Leaving everything to Loren, Quentin felt no worries.

Quentin drove up to the Black Family's place.

Their villa was perched on a mountaintop, with one side hanging over a cliff. It looked pretty dangerous.

Quentin parked, and a servant waiting in the yard nodded at him. "Mr. Black, you're here."

Quentin asked, "What's up with Mr. Bruno Black? Why'd he call me back so urgently?"

The servant hesitated. "Seems there's news about Mr. Wade Black."

Quentin had an older brother, Wade Black.

Years ago, Wade went overseas for business, and his cruise ship capsized. They never found his body, and after all these years, everyone assumed Wade was dead. But Quentin knew Bruno had never stopped looking for him. As Bruno put it, he wanted to see Wade alive or dead.

And now, that day had come!

A dark look flashed in Quentin's eyes, but he said nothing and headed straight upstairs to find Bruno.

In the study, Bruno threw a stack of photos at Quentin. "These were taken on a small island in Nyxonia. Look, is this Wade?"

Quentin picked up the photos and flipped through them.

Bruno sat behind the desk, his sharp eyes locked on Quentin's face.

After a few glances, Quentin said, "These photos are really blurry, and the guy looks dirty. He does resemble Wade, but his eyes don't quite match."

Before Quentin could finish, Bruno grabbed the ashtray on the desk and hurled it at him.

Quentin didn't have time to dodge. The ashtray hit him in the face, leaving a sharp wound on his cheek that started bleeding. The ashtray hit the floor with a dull thud.

Quentin turned his head slightly, first looking at the ashtray on the ground, then raising his eyes to meet Bruno's furious gaze.

Bruno roared, "Do you really think I don't know? Why did Wade's ship capsize for no reason back then? Why did he disappear? Do you think I know nothing?" He slammed the desk. "Quentin, I admire your ruthlessness, but even without Wade, you're not fit to be my successor. Do you think killing Wade would make me pass the position to you? Dream on!"

Quentin lowered his eyes, looking obedient. "Mr. Black, I really appreciate you helping me out when I needed it. I'd never do anything shady like that or even think about taking over the Black Family. Wade's the one for that job, whether he's around or not."

"Good!" Bruno said. "Then I'll leave the task of bringing Wade back to you. If anything goes wrong this time, you know the consequences!"

Quentin pressed his lips together. "Alright. I'll bring Wade back safely and hand him over to you."

Quentin walked out of the villa, the cold wind howling.

Sitting in the car, Quentin looked at the wound on his cheek in the mirror, and a murderous look flashed in his eyes.

###chapter 419 Asking for Someone

The phone buzzed. It was the research institute calling.

Quentin pressed his tongue against his cheek and picked up.

"Mr. Black, Zaire's here with the cops," the voice on the other end said.

"Got it," Quentin replied, cool as a cucumber. "I'll be there soon."

"Okay, Mr. Black."

Just as the call was about to end, Quentin added, "How's the heart transplant going?"

"Smooth sailing. No worries."

"Good." Quentin nodded.

He hung up and glanced back at the villa perched on the cliff, a cold smile playing on his lips. Then he hopped in his car and took off.

Even though Zaire had called the cops, they didn't have solid evidence or a search warrant. All they could do was follow protocol, ask some basic questions, and wait for Quentin to show up.

Hours dragged by. Marvin's anxiety grew. He turned to Zaire, "If this keeps up, things could get really bad!"

Zaire frowned. He got it, but his hands were tied. If they were in Lakina, he could pull some strings, but here in Silvercrest, he had no connections.

The delay in getting the search warrant was probably Quentin's doing.

Just as Zaire was about to talk to the officers, Quentin arrived.

"Mr. Black, these folks are from Lakina. They say you took their relative and are holding her against her will. Have you seen this woman? Do you know her name? Is she at your research institute?" the cops fired off a bunch of questions.

Zaire frowned. This line of questioning was off. Quentin wasn't dumb; he wouldn't just admit to something like that. This was serious business!

Quentin glanced at the photo in the officer's hand, then nodded. "Yeah, I know her. Her name's Isabella Miller. She's at my research institute, but you can't see her."

Zaire and Marvin exchanged surprised looks. They didn't expect Quentin to admit it so quickly, but they didn't understand what he meant by 'you can't see her.'

Zaire said sternly, "Mr. Black, holding someone against their will and threatening their safety is illegal."

Quentin looked at Zaire. "Of course I know that, Mr. Jose. I'm not clueless about the law."

Zaire said, "If you know that, you shouldn't have brought Isabella here and detained her."

Quentin raised an eyebrow. "Mr. Jose, if you say I detained Isabella, do you have any proof? You know slander is illegal too."

Zaire said, "I'm not slandering you. Marvin here is a witness. He used to work at your research institute. He saw you detain Isabella and force a physical exam on her. Do you admit to that?"

"Except for the detainment part, the rest is true. Isabella's my sister. I did the physical exam for her health. What's wrong with that?" Quentin said, sounding all righteous.

This was Zaire's first face-off with Quentin, and he realized just how sharp Quentin was. The guy was slicker than your average businessman, always calm and logical, dodging every trap like a pro. How sharp must Quentin's mind be to pull that off?

Marvin stepped up. "Do you dare let us search?"

Quentin smirked. "It's not about daring. It's about can't."

He continued, "Isabella just had surgery. She's really weak, and I don't want anyone disturbing her. Sorry, but no search. Plus, you don't have a warrant, do you?"

Zaire gritted his teeth. "What did you do to Isabella? Why the sudden surgery?"

Quentin's smile widened. "That's Isabella's private matter. Sorry, can't disclose it."

"Quentin!" Zaire lunged, grabbing Quentin by the collar. "Are you even human?"

As the tension mounted, a voice cut in, "Mr. Jose."

Zaire turned to see Esme approaching.

When Quentin saw Esme step out of the elevator, a cold glint flashed in his eyes, but he kept his face neutral.

Esme walked over and addressed the police, "I'm Isabella's biological mother. Regarding my daughter, I believe I have the right to speak. First, Isabella came to Silvercrest with us voluntarily. Second, Quentin didn't detain her; she's always been free. She's just not feeling well and doesn't want to see anyone. She just had surgery and is still resting. Please, don't disturb her."

Zaire knew Esme was Isabella's biological mother, and when Isabella reunited with her, the whole Jose family was thrilled. So, Esme's words carried more weight for him than Quentin's.

Zaire asked, "Esme, what illness did Isabella have that needed sudden surgery?"

Knowing Isabella was alive gave Zaire some relief, but he still needed answers about the surgery.

Esme's eyes flickered, and she replied vaguely, "It's not convenient for me to say. What I can tell you is she's fine now and not in any life-threatening danger."

Zaire let go of Quentin and asked, "Can I see her?"

Esme shook her head. "I already said she needs to rest. You know Seb hurt her deeply this time. She doesn't want to see anyone from Lakina right now. I hope you understand, Mr. Jose."

Zaire frowned. "Seb's situation was a misunderstanding. I can explain it to Isabella."

"You?" Esme shook her head with a smile. "If so, why didn't Seb come to explain himself? Why did he send you instead?"

Zaire pressed his lips together.

###chapter 420 Returning You a Brand New Lova

To keep Siena calm, Seb was still playing dumb.

Zaire couldn't blow Seb's cover yet, so when Esme started grilling him, he just kept his mouth shut.

Esme pressed on, "Mr. Jose, you should head back. Bella can figure out what's right and wrong on her own. Even if that whole thing was a mix-up, why didn't Seb come see Bella himself? That says a lot about where he stands. Let Seb know Bella's not desperate to get hitched."

In the end, Zaire left.

As soon as they were gone, Quentin's face turned dark. He looked at Esme. "Mom, why are you still here?"

Clearly, before Isabella's surgery, he had already asked Esme to leave.

Esme explained, "I did go back, but halfway there, I felt uneasy and decided to come back. I'm worried about Bella and Lova. I've also thought it through; if only one of them can survive, I would still choose Lova."

Quentin was a bit skeptical of Esme's words. He stared at her for a long time before saying, "It's good that you think that way."

Esme sighed. Quentin didn't push it further and turned to get in the elevator. Esme followed him. They arrived at the hospital room.

The surgery was over, and Isabella lay on the bed, looking pale.

On the bed next to her, Lova's body was completely covered with a white sheet.

Quentin walked over, lifted a corner of the sheet, and seeing Lova's lifeless body, he closed his eyes in pain. The sheet slipped from his hand, covering Lova's face again.

Then Quentin walked to Isabella's bed and reached out to lift her blanket.

Esme quickly said, "Quentin!"

Quentin paused and turned to look at her.

There was clear tension in Esme's eyes. "Bella already has a family. It's not appropriate for you to do this."

Esme's words made Quentin a bit annoyed. He said, "With a new heart, she won't be Isabella anymore; she'll be Lova."

Esme said, "But even if she is Lova, Quentin, it's still not appropriate."

"I'm Lova's brother. I raised her since she was little. What's inappropriate about it?" Quentin finished speaking and glanced at Esme. "You don't need to be so nervous. I just want to check her wound."

Quentin was very suspicious. Because he hadn't seen the entire surgery process, he was still afraid of being deceived. He had to personally confirm the post-surgery wound to be at ease.

Esme knew that if she insisted on stopping him, Quentin would definitely become suspicious. But if she didn't stop him, Quentin would notice something unusual. Esme was visibly on edge.

Esme couldn't imagine, with Quentin's temper, if he found out the truth, would he go mad and make everyone pay?

"Mom, you seem very nervous?" Quentin finally saw through Esme and asked slowly.

"No," Esme quickly denied. Facing Quentin's eyes, her heart skipped a beat. "Quentin, I just think that even with a new heart, Bella is still Bella. She can never become Lova."

Quentin squinted his eyes. "You don't need to worry about that. Just give me a month, and I promise to give you a brand new Lova."

Esme said no more. She had seen Quentin's sinister and terrifying side.

People said the most terrifying person in the Black Family was Bruno, but over the years, maybe due to age, Esme felt that Bruno wasn't as ruthless as before; while Quentin, sometimes, was downright chilling.

When Quentin was ruthless, he didn't seem human; he was like a demon straight out of hell.

Quentin gave Esme a long, hard look, then turned and decisively lifted a corner of the blanket.

Quentin's gaze fell, and he frowned slightly.

At that moment, Esme's heart felt like it was about to leap out of her chest. She bit her lip, her nails digging into her palms, her eyes glued to Quentin's every move.

A few seconds later, Quentin put the blanket down. "I've seen the wound; there's no problem."

Esme lowered her eyes. "Dr. Schneider said she need to be observed for a while longer, fearing rejection and potential complications."

"Yeah." Quentin's brows relaxed. When he looked at Isabella again, his eyes were different. "Don't worry. With me here, Lova won't suffer too much."

Esme glanced at Quentin and said no more.

Zaire reported everything that happened today to Seb.

Zaire said, "From what Esme said, Isabella is angry with you. Maybe you should come over and see her yourself to clear up any misunderstandings."

Seb was silent for a long time before saying, "I'll find a way to come over. Zaire, please keep an eye on things for a few more days."

"No problem." Zaire hadn't finished speaking when he heard something fall on the other end. He immediately asked nervously, "Seb, are you okay?"

"I'm fine." Seb's voice sounded somewhat pained.

The muffled thud just now was the sound of Seb tumbling from the bed to the floor. At this moment, Seb was gripping the phone with one hand while clutching the edge of the bed with the other, straining to support himself, large beads of sweat trickling down his forehead. Seb said, "I'll hang up now. Contact me at any time if anything comes up."

"Okay." Zaire, still worried, called Kelsey after hanging up, asking her to check on Seb when she had time.

Seb took out painkillers from the drawer, swallowed two, and leaned against the bed, gradually feeling better.

The headache subsided bit by bit with the medication, but the longing in his heart didn't diminish. He missed Bella so much that it hurt.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

Then Siena's voice came through the door. "Seb, are you asleep? I made some soup for you. Can I come in? Seb, if you don't answer, I'm coming in."

Siena waited a few seconds, and when Seb still didn't respond, she reached for the doorknob.

But as soon as she tried to turn it, her smile froze. The door didn't budge; it was locked from the inside.

Siena was stunned and continued knocking. "Seb, are you okay? Seb?"

These days, Seb never locked the door against Siena.

For the first time in this house, Siena felt like the lady of the house; she came and went freely, with all of Seb's living spaces open to her. But now, she was locked out!

Siena knocked on the door for a long time; she finally got a response from Seb. "I'm not feeling well; I am lying down. Siena, you should rest."

Siena felt uneasy; Seb's attitude seemed different today.

She wanted to keep knocking but was afraid of upsetting Seb.

In the end, as Siena just looked down at the bowl of soup in her hands, she silently turned and left.

After she left, Kelsey came rushing into hospital.

###chapter 421 Something Seemed to Click for Her

Siena spotted Kelsey on the video doorbell screen, and from her aggressive stance, Siena knew better than to open the door.

After a few moments, Kelsey glared at the camera and barked, "Siena, open the door!"

Siena's heart skipped a beat, wondering if Kelsey could somehow see her.But she quickly shook off the thought; there was no way Kelsey could see through the thick door.

Realizing Kelsey was bluffing, Siena stayed quiet, eyes glued to the screen.

Siena didn't want Kelsey barging in and messing up her and Seb's life.

She figured if she left Kelsey hanging long enough, she'd eventually leave.

However, Kelsey yelled, "If you don't open the door, I'll break in!"

Siena stayed put, feeling safe behind the locked door. She didn't think Kelsey could get in without her help.

But then, to her shock, Kelsey punched in a password and after a few beeps, a voice prompt confirmed the lock was open.

By the time Siena realized and wanted to lock the door, Kelsey had already pushed it open and entered.

"Siena, why didn't you open the door for me?" Kelsey demanded, storming in with a scowl.

Siena was stunned but tried to stay calm. "I was just coming over when you opened the door. How did you know the house password?" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

Siena had changed the door lock password after moving in to avoid trouble.

Only she and Seb knew it. How did Kelsey, an outsider, know it?

Kelsey rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. "This isn't your house at all. This is the home of Seb, Bella, and Sweetie. What are you doing here?"

Siena pressed her lips together, watching Kelsey's every move. "Ms. Jose, what brings you here?" she asked, trying to stay polite.

"Zaire asked me to check on Seb," Kelsey said, glancing back at her. "Why are you so nervous?"

Siena stammered, "Nothing, but Seb isn't feeling well and is resting. If it's not urgent..."

Kelsey cut her off, her voice rising. "It's very urgent."

With that, Kelsey started heading upstairs.

"Ms. Jose!" Siena ran over to stop her.

"Seb must be asleep by now. I just brought him some soup, and he didn't even open the door.Â You shouldn't disturb him."

Kelsey rolled her eyes. "He might be targeting only you. If I were Seb, I wouldn't want to see you either, because on one would like to look at a scheming face every day. It merely make anyone sick." she snapped, dripping with sarcasm.

"Ms. Jose, you may curse me as you wish, but please do not trouble Seb." Siena pleaded, her voice firm.

"Move!" Kelsey snapped, not one to be easily swayed. She brushed past Siena and continued upstairs.

Realizing she couldn't stop Kelsey, Siena didn't try anymore.

She believed Seb would definitely stop Kelsey at the door.

But Siena was still uneasy.

Bradley had advised that Seb should avoid contact with people and things related to Isabella to prevent triggering any memories. Without hesitation, she followed Kelsey upstairs.

Kelsey knocked on the bedroom door. "Seb? It's me. Zaire asked me to check on you."

There was no response.

Kelsey kept knocking, trying to stay patient. "Seb?"

Siena stood a few steps behind, watching quietly. She couldn't help but gloat seeing Kelsey get the same cold shoulder she had.

"Seb?" Kelsey called again, her voice a mix of frustration and concern.

Siena's smile faded. She was about to ask Kelsey to leave when she saw Seb open the door and let Kelsey in.

Seeing this, Siena's face turned red with anger.

As Kelsey walked into Seb's room, Siena quickly stepped up and held the door. "Seb, I made some soup for you. Do you want to drink it now?"

Seb frowned. "Okay. Bring it over."

"I'll go get it right away." Siena was all smiles as she headed downstairs.

But when she came back with the soup, the bedroom door was closed again. She tried the doorknob, but it was locked from the inside.

Siena knocked on the door, her voice gentle but firm. "Seb? I have brought the soup."

A few seconds later, Seb's voice came through the door, sounding distant. "I've got no appetite right now. You can take it away."

Siena was stunned. It felt like a slap in the face.

Inside Seb's room, Kelsey lowered her voice. "Seb, do you really not remember Isabella?" she asked softly.

Seb lowered his head, rubbing his temples, and remained silent.

Kelsey looked at him, conflicted. "Seb, Bella is supposed to be your wife. You were about to get married, and you have a daughter, Sweetie. Bella went through so much to be with you. Even if you forget everyone else, you shouldn't forget Bella."

"Is that why you came?" Seb frowned, his eyes narrowing.

Seeing his expression change, Kelsey softened her tone even more.Â "Seb, I only feel sorry for Bella. You two have been through so much together and were on the brink of marriage, but then you suddenly lost your memory. It's true that good things often face many trials, but the challenges you've faced are indeed overwhelming."

Seb listened, his heart aching slightly.

Seeing his reaction, Kelsey continued softly, "Actually, the one who's really suffering in all this is Sweetie. You don't know how well-behaved she has been lately. She's like an angel. If you miss her, I can bring her to see you tomorrow."

Now that Isabella wasn't in Lakina, Kelsey thought Sweetie was the most likely person to trigger Seb's memories.

"Sweetie," Seb murmured, his expression softening.

"Yes. Do you want to see her?" Kelsey asked gently, her eyes hopeful.

Just as Seb was about to speak, there was another knock on the door, and Siena's voice came through. "Seb, are you okay? Mr. Vaughn is here."

Seb glanced toward the door, then suddenly grabbed Kelsey's arm and whispered urgently, "Take good care of Sweetie. Don't bring her here. Kelsey, I'm begging you."

Kelsey was stunned.

"Seb," she whispered, her eyes wide with surprise.

At that moment, something seemed to click for her.

###chapter 422 A Heart Transplant

Before Kelsey could say a word, Seb hit the floor with a loud thud.

Kelsey quickly opened the door, letting Bradley and Siena rush in. Bradley took one look at Seb and said, "I need to treat him. Step out, Ms. Jose," as he pushed Kelsey out of the room.

Siena, with a frosty tone, added, "Ms. Jose, please leave and don't come back."

Kelsey was taken aback, then let out an angry laugh. "What gives you the right to tell me to leave? Siena, do you truly consider yourself the mistress of this house?"

"Right now, I'm the only woman here. Doesn't that make me the lady of the house?" Siena replied smugly, as if it was obvious.

Kelsey shot back, "But the lady of the house is still being shut out."

Siena's face turned red with anger.

Kelsey made a face at her. "This is still Seb and Isabella's home. You're just an outsider; you will never be the lady of this house!"

Siena clenched her fists and declared, "No! One day, I will be!"

"Keep dreaming. Anything's possible in dreams," Kelsey retorted with a disdainful look, then turned and walked away.

Late at night, by the cliff behind the Black Mansion, a small flame flickered in the wind.

As Esme crouched beside the fire, the flickering light was mirrored in her eyes, and large tears streamed down her cheeks.

The surroundings were silent.

Esme wiped her tears and murmured in a voice only she could hear, "Lova, please don't blame me. I know you'd understand why I did what I did. Rest in peace. I'll pray for you every day."

Her voice was so soft that only she could hear it.

Footsteps crunching dry leaves came from behind. Esme turned around, startled, and saw Quentin, then she quickly wiped away her tears.

Quentin glanced at the candle on the ground and asked, "Are you praying for Isabella?"

Esme nodded. "Yes."

Quentin bent down, picked up a small candle, and lit it from the flame, then he placed it beside the other candles.

Quentin looked at the candles and said, "Isabella, rest in peace. I'll make sure we get a priest to give you a proper send-off."

After lighting the candle, Quentin and Esme stood in silence for a moment, their heads bowed in respect.

Then, they walked back together.Â 

The night in the mountains was exceptionally cold, and the wind felt even chillier than usual.

After walking for a while, Quentin said, "Mom, I need to go to Nyxonia tomorrow. I'll be back in three to five days at the latest. While I'm gone, can you take care of Lova for me? Please, make sure she's alright."

Esme paused and asked, "I heard from Mr. Black that there's news about Wade?"

"Yes," Quentin nodded. "Once Wade is back, Lova will get better, and our family can finally be reunited."

Yet Esme was far from delighted.

When she married Bruno, he already had two sons. The eldest son, Wade, was born to Bruno's late wife.

Quentin was the second, and he was adopted, so he didn't have the Black Family's blood.

Esme didn't like either Wade or Quentin because both of them were vicious people.

Thinking about what Wade had done to Lova, Esme even felt a strong sense of physical disgust.

The peaceful days were likely to be disrupted by Wade's return.

Isabella had been out cold for three days.

When she finally opened her eyes, her mind was a blank slate, and for a moment, she was too weak to move.

All she could see was a sea of white, and the air reeked of medical disinfectant.

She tried to move and felt a sharp pain in her chest. She touched it and felt soft white gauze.

The gauze was wrapped around her chest, and when she pressed it lightly, it felt like there was a deep wound underneath, almost as if it reached her heart.

A nurse walked in and, seeing Isabella awake, said with some joy, "Ms. Black, you're awake!"

She quickly pulled out a walkie-talkie from her pocket, pressed the button, "Tell Mrs. Black that Ms. Black is awake."

Isabella was confused. She asked, "Why are you calling me that?"

The nurse came over, stood by the bed, took her temperature, recorded various data from the instruments, and replied with a smile, "You've always been Ms. Black, the Black Family's Ms. Black."

"The Black Family?" Isabella was slightly dazed, then shook her head. "You must be mistaken. My last name is Miller. I'm Isabella Miller."

Maybe it was because she had slept too long that Isabella felt she couldn't process everything immediately.

At that moment, the door to the ward opened again, and Esme walked in.

Esme said, "Lova, my dear, you're finally awake!" She almost ran in, then she reached the bedside and grabbed Isabella's hands tightly.Â 

Esme's excitement and happiness didn't seem fake.

Isabella frowned. "I'm not Lova; I'm Isabella."

Esme was stunned, then laughed. "Lova, are you still groggy from sleep? You are Lova. How could you be Isabella?"

"Nonsense!" Isabella retorted. She pulled her hands back.

Although her mind was still a bit blank, she remembered that Esme had chosen to sacrifice her to save Lova in the most critical moment.

Isabella hated Esme more than ever.

Isabella got out of bed, pulled out the IV, and walked out.

"Lova, where are you going?" Esme called out, chasing after her.Â 

Esme and the nurse blocked Isabella at the door.

The nurse reminded, "Ms. Black, your hand is bleeding."

Isabella didn't care about her hand. She frowned and insisted, "I'm not Ms. Black. I'm Isabella.Miller. Move, I want to go out!"

"Lova," Esme grabbed Isabella's arm and coaxed, "You just had surgery and need to rest. Be good and go back to bed."

Listening to Esme constantly call her Lova, Isabella was already on the brink of madness.

Isabella forcefully shook off Esme.

The movement was too big and sudden, pulling at her wound and causing Isabella to gasp in pain.

She gritted her teeth as large beads of sweat appeared on her forehead. "Are you all crazy? Â I'm not Lova! What did you do to me?"

The pain in Isabella's chest felt like it was tearing her apart.

Blood was already seeping through the bandages, looking very alarming.

Esme took a step back and she suggested softly, trying to calm her down, "Lova, you just had a heart transplant. You mustn't get too emotional."

Isabella's mind buzzed, and she almost lost her balance.

She grabbed onto the edge of a nearby table for support. "What did you say?" she stammered, her eyes wide with disbelief. "A heart transplant?"

###chapter 423 Medicine

Isabella clutched her chest, afraid to press too hard, because even the lightest touch would bring intense pain.

The sensation of pain wasn't just on the surface; it seemed to radiate from within.

It felt as if each breath stabbed her throat.

Isabella was so shocked that she took two steps back, almost losing her balance.

"Ms. Black." The nurse quickly supported Isabella and reminded worriedly. "Ms. Black, be careful; you mustn't fall!"

Isabella brushed off the nurse's hand and staggered to the side, holding onto the end of the hospital bed to steady herself.

Esme and the nurse both watched Isabella with tense expressions, hesitant to approach for fear of upsetting her, yet worried she might hurt herself.

Their cautious and concerned demeanor appeared genuine.

As Isabella noticed a slight dampness on her fingers, she removed her hand from the bandage, and her fingertips were stained with fresh blood, emitting a faint metallic smell.

"Lova," Esme called softly and wanted to come closer.

Isabella glared at Esme, her voice slightly out of control. "Don't come any closer!"

"Okay, I won't come closer." Esme hurriedly said, holding her hands up in a placating gesture. "Lova, calm down; don't get agitated."

Only then did Isabella truly believe she had undergone surgery-an unbelievable surgery!

She thought she had just taken a nap, but someone had taken the opportunity to replace her heart!

Tears streaming down Isabella's face, she tried to control herself, but her voice still trembled uncontrollably. "Did Quentin give me Lova's heart?"

Esme nodded heavily. "Yes."

Isabella's eyes widened in shock. "Didn't they say we were to have a blood transfusion? How did it turn into a heart transplant? Why did this happen?"

Esme didn't dare to meet Isabella's gaze and looked slightly away, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Before the surgery, Lova removed her oxygen tube, leading to hypoxia and bringing her to the brink of death. They gave their best to save her but failed. Even if they had transfused your blood to her at that moment, she would never have opened her eyes again."

"So you came up with this twisted idea, to keep Lova alive by taking out my heart and replacing it with hers, is that it?" Isabella interrupted as she gritted her teeth, her voice filled with rage.

She couldn't believe how cruel someone had to be to come up with such a vicious plan and make it a reality!

And among those people was her own mother, Esme!

Esme argued, trying to comfort her, "Regardless of everything, both you and Lova are alive. Isn't that a win-win situation in some way?"

At this point, Esme realized that nothing she said would help, so she could only try to comfort Isabella.

Isabella laughed in anger.

Isabella would rather have slept forever, at least she wouldn't have to open her eyes and see these people's merciless faces again.

"To hell with your win-win!" Isabella spat, her voice shaking with fury. She turned and bolted for the door.

Before the nurse nor Esme reacted,Â Isabella had already run out of the ward.

Outside was a long, wide corridor with large but empty space. In the deserted hallway, Isabella ran a dozen steps before encountering a nurse.

Isabella rushed over, grabbed her hand, and asked, "Where's the exit? Where's the elevator?"

The nurse turned and pointed in a direction.

"Thank you," Isabella said and ran in that direction.

But just as she lifted her foot, the nurse behind her suddenly raised her hand and injected a sedative into the back of Isabella's neck.

Isabella felt a sharp pain in her neck. When she turned around, she saw the nurse slowly putting away the syringe.

Not far away, Esme and another nurse were running towards her.

Isabella fell to the ground, completely losing consciousness.

Lakina

The Landon family

On the other side, Seb woke up, feeling like someone was watching him.

When he opened his eyes, he indeed met a pair of eyes.

"Seb, you're awake?" Siena smiled and leaned over to help Seb.

Seb pushed her hand away. His head felt heavy as he sat up, bent one leg, and rested his elbow on his knee, rubbing his temples. "What time is it?"

Siena replied, "It's three in the afternoon."

Seb muttered, a bit surprised. " Did I sleep that long?"

Before sleeping, Seb had glanced at the clock; it was around twelve-thirty.

He had slept for two and a half hours.

"Yes. You were sleeping soundly, so I didn't wake you," Siena said, turning to grab a bowl of soup from the bedside table.

She placed it in front of Seb. "Seb, this is the medicine Mr. Vaughn prescribed. I've already prepared it for you, and it's cooled to the right temperature. You should drink it now."

Seb looked at the bowl of medicine, his brow furrowing deeply. "Just set it aside; I'll drink it later."

But Siena insisted, her tone firm. "Medicine is best taken while it's hot; it won't be as effective if it cools down. Mr. Vaughn emphasized this. You'd better follow the doctor's advice!"

Seb frowned but said nothing.

Siena urged, "Seb, Mr. Vaughn is doing this for your own good. Only by heeding his advice will you recover swiftly."

Seb remained silent, just kept rubbing his temples.

Seeing this, Siena stopped urging him to drink the medicine immediately.

She turned and set the bowl down, then walked to the bedside and reached out to help Seb rub his temples.

As soon as her fingers touched Seb, he recoiled as if shocked.Â Siena was taken aback.

Seb asked, "What are you doing?"

Siena explained, "I saw you were in pain and wanted to help you."

"No need," Seb said, his tone cold.

He picked up the bowl of medicine and drank it all in one go, then handed the empty bowl to her. He said, "I drank it. Can you leave now?"

"Seb, do you really dislike me being in your room that much?" Siena asked, feeling wronged.

"Did Ms. Jose say something to you today? You weren't like this before; your attitude suddenly changed today."

"No, don't overthink it. I just have a terrible headache." Seb replied, rubbing his temples.

Seeing that Seb indeed didn't look well, Siena believed him a little.

Not wanting to push him and make him resent her, Siena decided to back off.

She took the empty bowl and said, "I'll be downstairs. Call me if you need anything."

Seb nodded. "Okay."

Only then did Siena reluctantly leave the room, glancing back one last time before closing the door behind her.

###chapter 424 Fainting

After waiting for a few minutes, Seb suddenly got up, walked over, and locked the door. H

e rushed into the bathroom, leaned over the sink, and used his fingers to induce vomiting, trying to get rid of the medicine he had just taken.

Seb knew something was off with the medicine; Bradley must have messed with it.

Otherwise, he wouldn't be in such poor spirits, nor would he be out of it all day.

Besides, Siena always brought the medicine herself and made sure he took it right in front of her.

Seb was utterly oblivious to Bella's whereabouts.

He had to play along, taking the medicine and then throwing it up.

But he couldn't get rid of it all; some of it always got into his system.

Seb could tell his mental state had been getting worse over the past few days.

Even while working, he kept getting distracted, which was totally unlike him.

The most obvious change was his memory getting worse.

He used to remember everything without needing Jack's help.

But lately, he even forgot the time for the morning meeting.

Seb washed his face and looked at his haggard reflection in the mirror, worry in his eyes.

'If this keeps up, I'll lose my memory! If I forget Bella one day, what will I do?' he thought, anxiety creeping in. 'I need a new plan; I can't keep doing this.'

As he contemplated, Seb already came up with a plan.

The next day, when Siena brought the medicine again, Seb didn't refuse and gulped it down.

Seeing this, Siena's face lit up with satisfaction.

Bradley had told her that if Seb took this medicine for a month, he'd completely forget who Isabella was and become subservient to her.

The thought made Siena super excited.

Siena didn't know where Bradley got the medicine from, nor did she care about its ingredients. She only cared about the results.

As long as the results were good, even if Bradley gave her poison, she'd feed it to Seb without hesitation.

Siena even thought Bradley was amazing for having such a miraculous drug.

She believed it wouldn't be long before she could become Mrs. Landon and stand proudly by Seb's side.

The more she thought about it, the more smug she became.

But just as Siena reached out to take the empty bowl, Seb suddenly flipped his hand, sending the bowl crashing to the ground.

Before Siena could react, she watched in horror as Seb collapsed in front of her.

"Seb!" Siena exclaimed in shock.

At that moment, the doorbell rang.

Siena hurried to open the door, her heart pounding. "Jack, something's wrong. Seb fainted!"

Jack strode into the living room, his expression tense. "How did this happen?" he demanded.

"I don't know," Siena replied, shaking her head in confusion. "He was fine just a moment ago. But after taking the medicine, he suddenly collapsed."

Jack crouched down, placed his fingers under Seb's nose to check his breathing, and then said to Siena, "Grab the car keys quickly; we need to take Mr. Landon to the hospital!"

Siena hesitated, "Maybe I should call Mr. Vaughn first?"

As Siena turned to leave, Jack called out urgently, "No, Mr. Landon is bleeding!"

"What?" Siena spun around, her eyes widening in horror as she saw blood trickling from Seb's mouth.

Her face turned pale with fear. "How could this happen?"

Jack kept his cool and said, "Mr. Landon's in bad shape. Even if Bradley shows up, we don't have the right medical gear here to examine and treat Mr. Landon. We have to get him to the hospital! We can wait, but Mr. Landon might not make it."

Seeing Seb's pale face, Siena freaked out.

She couldn't tell if it was the blood at the corner of his mouth, but his complexion seemed unusually pale,Â as though he were teetering on the edge of death.

Jack made sense, so she grabbed the car keys, and then they rushed to the hospital.

As soon as they got there, Seb was taken into the emergency room. Jack and Siena waited outside.

Feeling uneasy, Siena paced back and forth before saying, "Maybe I should call Mr. Vaughn."

Bradley had told her to report any situation with Seb immediately. This definitely counted as a situation, so she should inform Bradley.

Jack said, "Let's wait until Mr. Landon comes out."

Siena turned to Jack, "Mr. Vaughn is Seb's personal doctor. No one knows Seb's condition better than him. I think it's better to call him over."

Jack shook his head. "Until Mr. Landon's test results come out, I advise you not to alarm Bradley."

Siena's heart skipped a beat, "Why?"

Before Jack could answer, the emergency room door opened, and he quickly walked in.

Siena also wanted to know Seb's condition immediately, so she didn't bother calling Bradley and followed Jack inside.

The medical staff had finished treating Seb and were cleaning up.

Seb lay on the hospital bed, with an oxygen tube in his nose, his face pale as if he had just survived a life-and-death ordeal.

Jack asked, "Doctor, how is he?"

The emergency doctor removed his mask and replied, "For now, there's no major issue, and his life is not in danger. But..."

Jack pressed, "But what?"

The doctor paused and then asked, "What did he eat before he was brought here?"

Hearing this, Siena's heart skipped a beat. She stammered, "Nothing special, just some medicine."

The doctor probed, "What kind of medicine?"

"I don't know." Siena shook her head and quickly added, "It was prescribed by his personal doctor for mental recovery."

The doctor frowned, looking skeptical, "Can you bring some of it for me to see?"

Siena hesitated, "Well..." She knew the medicine had abnormal ingredients and didn't dare to show it to the doctor.

What if it was discovered by Jack? What should Siena do?

Just as Siena was about to refuse, Jack said, "I brought some."

Jack then took a handful of medicinal residue from his pocket.

He had collected it when he carried Seb, scooping it up from the spilled bowl on the floor.

At this moment, Siena watched in shock as Jack handed it to the doctor.

She wanted to stop him but feared arousing suspicion, so she held back.

She merely hoped that the medicine would not be found to have any issues.

Siena still wanted to call Bradley, but Jack was watching her closely. She had to sneak out, find a secluded spot, and take out her phone.

Just as she unlocked it, she heard footsteps behind her, followed by Jack's voice, "What are you doing here?"

Siena was startled, dropping her phone to the ground.

Jack glanced at her, then walked over, picked up the phone, and warned, "Ms. Scott, until the drug test results come out, I hope you don't act rashly and call Bradley. That will only harm Mr. Landon!"

Siena was taken aback, asking, "What do you mean?"

Just as Jack was about to respond, a nurse approached and said, "Hey, the patient is awake. Please come quickly!"

###chapter 425 Being Mentally Challenged

Seb was awake, but something was off in his eyes.

Jack and Siena walked in, one after the other.

"Mr. Landon," Jack said, treading carefully.

"Seb?" Siena's voice wavered as she got closer.

Seb's eyes flicked from Jack to Siena. Then he suddenly sat up, grabbed the water cup from the bedside table, and chucked it at Siena.

The cup hit the floor, shattering into pieces as Siena screamed.

"Mr. Landon!" Jack was shocked and rushed to hold Seb back.

But Seb pushed Jack away with unexpected strength, got out of bed, and pointed at them, yelling, "You're all bad people."

This sudden change astounded everyone. Jack froze, and Siena was even more shocked, unable to utter a word.

Seb looked at them, his demeanor and actions now drastically different from his usual self.

"Seb, what's wrong with you?" Siena asked, her voice shaking, tears welling up.

Seb wouldn't let Siena get close. He was still super agitated, shouting that Siena was a bad person.

Soon, doctors and nurses rushed in. After checking Seb and calming him down, they called Jack and Siena out.

In the consultation room, the doctor handed them a lab report. "Take a look at this first."

It was a medical report, listing a bunch of drug names. Jack and Siena stared at it like it was written in another language.

"What is this?" Jack asked bluntly.

The doctor didn't sugarcoat it. "These are the drug components found in the medications you brought. Some of these drugs contain additional harmful substances."

Siena's heart skipped a beat, and she quickly defended, "These were all prescribed by Seb's private doctor. Mr. Vaughn said there were some stimulating components, but he controlled the dosage, so it wouldn't be detrimental to Seb's body!"

"Taking them for a short period isn't a problem, but if taken multiple times a day, it can damage the brain. And such damage is irreversible," the doctor explained, his tone serious.

"From Mr. Landon's examination report, his brain was recently stimulated and is already in a very perilous state."

"In such a stage, we generally recommend conservative treatment. Using these drugs now is like adding fuel to the fire for him. As you can see, his intelligence is likely to remain at the level of a seven-year-old child forever."

The doctor shook his head, sighing at the loss of Seb's young life.

"A seven-year-old child?" Siena was stunned, her eyes wide in shock.

Everything the doctor said lined up with what she knew.

In fact, this really wasn't Bradley's fault.

Bradley had recommended taking the medication three times a week, but Siena, afraid that Seb would remember Isabella and the past, had upped the dosage on her own to gain control over Seb more quickly.

Thus, during this entire period, Seb had been consistently taking the medicine three times a day!

Siena felt a wave of guilt wash over her.

She had only wanted to speed things up, but she hadn't expected it to lead to such a disaster.

A seven-year-old's intelligence-wouldn't that mean being mentally challenged?

Seb becameÂ  mentally retarded?

How could this be?

"Doctor, are you sure? Could it be a misdiagnosis?" Jack asked, looking very serious.

A CEO of a conglomerate with the intelligence of a seven-year-old? This was like a horror story!

The doctor shook his head, sounding sure of himself. "With my decades of experience, I can guarantee this isn't a misdiagnosis."

"If you don't believe me, take Mr. Landon to other hospitals. Or bring his private doctor here, and I'll confront him face to face!"

Siena felt a wave of guilt wash over her.

The thought of calling Bradley made her nervous, and she clenched her fingers. Luckily, Jack didn't push the issue.

Given the situation, Jack didn't trust Bradley anymore. He left Seb in Siena's care and went off to find other renowned doctors.

Now, it was just Siena and Seb, who had the mind of a seven-year-old.

After his outburst, Seb had calmed down. But as soon as Siena walked in, he got wary and quickly hid his hands behind his back.

Siena narrowed her eyes, closed the door, and walked over. "Seb, what are you hiding?" she asked.

Seb looked at her, took a step back, but didn't answer. He hid his hands even more, looking like he was scared she'd take whatever he was hiding.

Siena pulled up a chair and sat down, softening her tone. "Seb, do you really not recognize me?"

Seb asked, "Who are you?"

Siena replied, "I'm Siena Scott, your sister."

Seb frowned, then glanced at the medical chart at the head of his bed. "Shouldn't my sister's last name be Landon?"

"I'm not your biological sister. I was adopted by Mom, so I have her last name," Siena explained, pointing to her face. "Seb, look at me. I look a lot like Mom. Can you remember Mom when you gaze at me?"

To Seb, Anna was a very important person.

Even though she died young, she always held a special place in his heart.

Otherwise, Seb wouldn't have taken such good care of Siena, who wasn't related to him by blood.

Everything between Seb and Siena was built on Anna.

So Siena tried to use Anna to jog Seb's memory.

But Seb just stared at her, looking confused. Clearly, he didn't remember anything.

Siena felt a bit defeated. She had wanted Seb to forget Isabella forever, but she hadn't meant for him to forget her too.

While Siena was lost in thought, Seb suddenly came over and took his hands out from behind his back. He whispered, "This is for you."

Siena looked down and saw a piece of candy in his palm. The bright wrapper stung her eyes a bit.

Under normal circumstances, Seb giving her candy would make her overjoyed.

But now, Siena didn't take it and just looked at Seb, puzzled.

Seb scratched his head, looking embarrassed, and gave her a sheepish smile. "Since you're my sister, this candy is for you."

Siena was speechless. Her feelings were all over the place.

This was the first time Seb had said something like this to her.

Normally, she'd be happy. But now, she felt uncomfortable.

Looking at the candy, Siena ultimately didn't take it. "I don't like candy; you eat it," she said.

But Seb shook his head and grabbed her hand, forcing the candy into it. "You eat it," he insisted.

Siena was at a loss for words.

She wanted to smile, but she couldn't, because she was overwhelmed with a mix of emotions.

###chapter 426 The Plan

Jack didn't get back until it was dark.

Siena couldn't leave Seb alone in the hospital, but being with him, possessing the intellect of a seven-year-old, left her feeling completely bewildered.

Just as she was about to step out for some air as night fell, Bradley showed up.

Bradley stormed out of the elevator, looking all stern and aggressive.

The second Siena saw him, she instinctively tried to bolt.

But it was too late. Bradley grabbed her arm and dragged her to the stairwell.

"Let go of me!" Siena struggled, scratching the back of Bradley's hand. "You're hurting me!"

Once in the stairwell, Bradley let go.

Siena stumbled, hitting the wall before she stopped.

She clutched her arm, glaring at Bradley. "What are you doing?"

"What am I doing?" Bradley snapped, standing right in front of her, eyes blazing. "I should be asking you that! What are you doing?"

Bradley approached, standing in front of her, his eyes nearly overflowing with fury.

"That's the question I should be asking you! What on earth are you doing?"

"What's wrong with Seb? Why's he in the hospital, and why's he acting like a seven-year-old? I told you to prepare his medicine; how did you mess it up? Did you follow my instructions?" Bradley bombarded her with questions.

Siena was stunned but shot back, "How should I know? I followed your instructions exactly. Now that something's gone wrong, I haven't even blamed you, and you're questioning me?"

Bradley grabbed her wrist again, pinning her against the wall. "At this point, you're still lying?"

Cornered, Siena had no choice but to come clean.

After hearing her out, Bradley shot her a vicious look and cursed, "Idiot, this is self-destructive!"

With that, Bradley let go and turned to leave.

Siena was momentarily stunned.

She chased after him, grabbing his shirt. "Mr. Vaughn, you must have a way, right? You're so capable; you must have a way to cure Seb, right?"

Bradley glanced at her, sneering. "How?"

"Just prescribe some medicine to restore Seb to his original state. This time, I promise to follow your instructions exactly, no more taking matters into my own hands," Siena pleaded.

"It's too late!" Bradley snapped.

"What do you mean?" Siena looked at him, confused.

Bradley pried her fingers off his shirt, straightening it.

"The doctor should've already told you, this kind of damage is irreversible. Once it's done, it's impossible for Seb to ever recover to his former self. Curing Seb now would be as hard as bringing someone back from the dead. Do you think Seb can be cured now?"

Siena stiffened, unable to process it.

Bradley glanced at her but didn't comfort her. He stepped aside, took out his phone, and reported the situation to Quentin.

After getting some instructions, Bradley responded and hung up.

He then walked back to Siena, calling, "Siena."

Siena snapped out of her daze, blinking rapidly

"Mr. Black said he doesn't believe Seb's intelligence has regressed to that of a seven-year-old," Bradley said, his voice tight with frustration.

He stepped closer, his eyes locking onto hers. "Now, tell me everything that happened today, and don't leave out a single detail!"

Siena shivered.

To be honest, she couldn't believe Seb had turned out this way either.

Everything that had happened felt surreal to her.

How could a perfectly fine person suddenly end up like this?

Bradley's words sparked a thought in Siena's mind.

She thought,'Could Seb be faking it?'

With no other options, Siena placed all her hopes on Bradley.

And even if Bradley couldn't help, there was still Quentin and the entire Black Family.

If Seb was indeed faking it, Bradley and his team would surely find a way to expose him.

Eagerly and in great detail, Siena recounted everything that had happened that day.

Bradley remained silent for quite a long time after listening.

Unable to hold back, Siena asked, "Does Mr. Black think Seb is pretending?"

Bradley glanced at her and smiled meaningfully. "To find out if he really become intellectually disabled, or just pretending, it's actually quite simple."

Siena asked curiously, "How?"

Bradley beckoned with his finger and demanded, "Come closer."

Siena hesitated but eventually leaned in.

Bradley wrapped an arm around her neck, his lips almost touching her ear, and as he spoke, his warm breath tickled her ear.

Bradley was so close, his arm so tight around her, that his hand nearly touched her chest.

The proximity and the posture made Siena feel somewhat violated.

But she didn't dare push Bradley away; after all, Bradley and Quentin were her only support and hope!

Without them, she was nothing.

Even staying by Seb's side would be a luxury.

Gritting her teeth, Siena endured.

When she heard Bradley's words, Siena's eyes widened in shock, whispering, "Will that work?"

Bradley looked down at Siena, eyes narrowing as he took in her outfit.

She'd chosen a low-cut V-neck dress today, and it hugged her chest in a way that showcased her ample cleavage.

From his angle, he had an unobstructed view, and he made no effort to hide his blatant staring.

With a mocking glint in his eye, Bradley taunted, "What's the matter? Can't bring yourself to do it?"

Siena's face twisted in conflict, her voice trembling as she said, "Isn't there another way? This is too cruel; I can't do it."

Bradley sneered, his fingers deliberately brushing across her chest, sending a shiver through Siena. She glared at him with a flushed face. "What are you doing?"

Bradley's eyes lingered on her chest, his tone indifferent. "What did I do?"

Siena, too embarrassed to pursue the matter, pretended he hadn't done it on purpose and brought the topic back. "Is there another way?"

Bradley impatiently frowned. "Either you try it, or you wait to die."

Siena shivered, finally gritting her teeth and agreeing. "Fine, I'll find a chance to test him!"

###chapter 427 Testing

Siena strolled into Seb's hospital room, with Bradley trailing right behind her.

Seb was already out cold in the bed, probably in a deep sleep, so their entrance didn't stir him.

Bradley shot her a look, and Siena moved closer to the bed, gently nudging Seb. "Seb?"

"Hmm?" Seb woke up groggily, rubbing his eyes.

When he saw Siena, his face lit up with a big smile. He grabbed her hand, "Siena, where'd you go? I was freaking out being alone in here."

Siena gave him a reassuring smile. "I just stepped out for a bit of fresh air."

"Oh." Seb didn't seem to doubt her at all and asked excitedly, "Where'd you go for fresh air? It's so boring and stuffy in here. I wanna get out too."

Siena coaxed, "Let me get some water to wash your face first, then we can go out, okay?"

Seb cheered. "Okay."

Bradley stood silently by the side, observing Seb's expressions and movements.

Just as Siena turned to the bathroom, Bradley suddenly called out, "Mr. Landon!"

Seb took a few seconds to react before turning to look at him.

With a childlike gaze, Seb looked Bradley up and down and then asked, "Who are you?"

Bradley walked over, smiling at him. "Mr. Landon, don't you recognize me? I'm your personal doctor. My name is Bradley."

"Bradley?" Seb echoed, mulling over the name while giving Bradley a once-over.

He scratched his head in confusion. "Are you really my personal doctor?"

"Absolutely," Bradley confirmed with a nod.

Just then, Siena came back in, carrying a basin.

Seb's eyes lit up, and he quickly turned to her, his excitement palpable. "Siena, guess what?"

He gestured toward Bradley. "I have a personal doctor now! I must be pretty impressive. Only big shots have personal doctors. Does that mean I'm loaded, like, rolling in dough?"

Siena exchanged a glance with Bradley and nodded. "Yes. Seb, you are now the president of the Landon Group. You have a lot of money."

Seb cheered, lost in thoughts. "Then we can go to the amusement park and eat lots of ice cream!"

Siena looked at Seb with a bit of conflict.

At this point, she really felt that Seb wasn't pretending.

After all, how could someone as steady as Seb pretend to be like this?

Siena glanced at Bradley, her eyes showing a hint of hesitation.

She thought, 'Maybe I shouldn't test him anymore.'

But Bradley gave Siena a fierce look, not leaving her any way out.

Siena gritted her teeth, placed the basin on the bedside table, then bent down to take a thermos from the cabinet, pouring all the boiling water into the basin.

Amidst the rising steam, Siena held the edge of the basin and approached Seb.

She suggested, "Seb, how about washing your face?"

Even from a distance, the heat from the boiling water could be felt.

If Seb washed his face with it, his face would be scalded.

This was the method Bradley suggested to test Seb.

Seb glanced at it, then cautiously reached his hand towards the water.

As soon as his fingers touched the surface, he quickly pulled back and exclaimed, "Hot!"

Siena widened her eyes. "Seb, you know it's hot?"

Seb pouted, "Siena, I'm not stupid. You clearly poured boiling water without adding cold water. It's really hot."

Siena felt a flicker of hope and quickly glanced at Bradley.

Did this mean Seb was really faking it?

But Bradley rolled his eyes at her, "He's just less intelligent, not dumb."

By the age of seven, a child's mind typically could grasp basic common sense.

Plus, Siena had poured the boiling water right in front of Seb.

Even a little kid would know that water's gonna be hot, right?

Bradley had set up this test to trap Seb.

If Seb had acted like a total fool, enduring the pain and happily washing his face with boiling water, that would have proven he was pretending!

But now, Bradley couldn't tell if Seb was faking it or not.

His behavior, speech, and smarts all matched that of a seven-year-old.

Bradley smiled and said to Seb, "Siena and I just came down from the rooftop. The night view from up there is really beautiful, and the air is great. Mr. Landon, would you like to go get some fresh air?"

Seb's eyes lit up as he nodded eagerly. "Yeah, Siena, take me there. I want to see the stars."

Siena knew this was another test.

She was confused now.

To find out if Seb was really pretending, she didn't hesitate to take Seb to the hospital rooftop.

The rooftop was pitch black, except for the sound of the wind and the brightly lit hospital sign.

Seb gazed upwards for a long time, then said with a hint of disappointment, "The weather tonight seems unfavorable; not a single star can be seen."

Seb turned around and saw Siena and Bradley standing together, both staring at him like they were trying to see through him.

Seb walked back, pulling Siena aside, and whispered, "Siena, he's scary. We should stay away from him, because he doesn't look like a good person."

Siena was speechless.

"Who said there are no stars?" Bradley spoke up, pointing to the nearby railing. "Mr. Landon, if you look over there, you'll see them."

"Are you sure?" Seb was half-believing, holding Siena's hand. "Siena, come with me."

Siena exchanged a glance with Bradley, and seeing him nod, she walked with Seb to the edge of the rooftop.

This was the highest building in the hospital.

Looking down from here, one could see half the city's bright lights, winding roads, and the flowing traffic.

From this view, it did look like a sky full of stars.

Seb seemed to be seeing such a scene for the first time, extremely excited.

He exclaimed happily, "Siena, look, it really looks like stars! That road looks like the Milky Way, so beautiful."

Siena gave a half-hearted smile.

Such a view was much more impressive from the large floor-to-ceiling windows of the Landon Group president's office.

At this moment, Seb's naive reaction was really getting on Siena's nerves.

Siena was lost in thought when she noticed Bradley approaching from the corner of her eye.

Siena knew the test was about to begin again.

She felt a bit edgy and instinctively tightened her grip on Seb's hand.

Siena was afraid Bradley might actually push Seb off the rooftop.

If it came to that, she could never let go; she could never just stand by and watch Seb fall right in front of her.

###chapter 428 Marriage

Siena was deep in thought when she suddenly felt a tight grip on the back of her neck.

Before she could react, Bradley had her by the throat and shoved her towards the edge of the railing.

He used so much force that most of her body was hanging over the edge.

Her hand clung desperately to the railing while the other hung precariously in the air.

As she glanced downward, an abyss yawned beneath her.

A fall from here would definitely be fatal.

Her voice shaking with fear, she gasped, "Bradley, are you out of your mind?"

She couldn't understand.

Weren't they supposed to be testing Seb?

Why was she the one being pushed to the brink?

All she knew was that she was in serious danger.

This lunatic might be planning to push her off first and then Seb, leaving no evidence behind.

Bradley ignored her desperate question.

After restraining her, he turned to look at Seb, who was still in shock, and grinned wickedly. "Mr. Landon, didn't you always hate Siena the most? How about I do you a favor and push her off? Once she's gone, you'll never have to see that annoying face again."

"Seb," Siena cried out desperately.

Seb snapped back to reality and immediately rushed to save Siena.

But his strength was no match for Bradley's, and he was easily shoved away.

Seb tried to approach again, but Bradley impatiently shouted, "If you come any closer, I will really let go!"

Seb stopped in his tracks. "Don't let go; don't kill Siena!" he pleaded.

Bradley sneered, staring into Seb's eyes, his eyes fixed intently on Seb's, fearing he might miss even the subtlest shift in Seb's expression.

"Mr. Landon, stop pretending. The drugs I gave you have a numbing effect on the nerves, but they shouldn't make you act like this. Don't forget, I'm your personal doctor. I know your physical condition inside out. You can't fool me."

Bradley's words seemed lost on Seb, whose expression remained blank.

He looked at Bradley with pleading eyes. "IÂ a lot of money. As long as you let Siena go, I can give you all my money," he said.

He then took out a lollipop from his pocket. "And this, too. The nurse gave it to me, and I couldn't bear to eat it. I'll give it all to you. Please let Siena go."

"Seb," Siena sobbed, tears streaming down her face.

She had always dreamt of the day Seb would protect her, and now her dream had come true.

Seb was finally willing to protect her, even willing to give up everything for her.

Bradley sneered, "Mr. Landon, if you're begging, do it with sincerity. I neither want your money nor your pleasantries."

"Then what do you want? Tell me! Whatever you want, I'll give it to you," Seb blurted out urgently, his negotiation style crude and childlike.

Bradley lost his patience, "As long as you kneel down and kowtow to me three times, I'll let Siena go. How about that?"

"No, Seb!" Siena screamed, then turned her fury toward Bradley. "Bradley, you bastard, that's enough!"

Bradley tightened his grip in response, making it almost impossible for Siena to breathe.

"Okay!" Seb agreed without hesitation.

He dropped to his knees with a thud, and then kowtowed to Bradley three times.

Even with dust on his forehead, he didn't care.

Bradley was stunned for a few seconds as he watched this scene unfold.

At this point, he was utterly convinced that Seb genuinely possessed the intellect of a seven-year-old child now.

The previous Seb would never do something like this, especially not for Siena.

Afterward, Siena and Seb went back to the ward, while Bradley left the hospital.

In Seb's room, Siena hugged him and cried uncontrollably. "Seb, how could you be so foolish? How could you kneel and kowtow to Bradley for me?"

Seb comforted her, "It's okay. Since you're my sister, it's only right for me to protect you. This is what I should do."

"Seb," Siena cried into his chest, overwhelmed with emotion. "Why are you so good to me?"

"Because you're my sister," Seb replied simply.

Siena bit her lip. "Does that mean you'll give me anything I want?"

"Of course," Seb answered without hesitation. "But if you want the stars and the moon, you might have to wait until I grow up."

Siena shook her head. "I don't want them, Seb. I just want you."

"What do you mean?" Seb asked, confused.

Siena took Seb's hand, her eyes resolute, and kissed him on the lips. "Seb, I want to marry you. I want to be your wife!"

Seb was stunned, a look of confusion on his face. "But you're my sister. Can I marry you?"

"Yes, you can," Siena assured him. "We have no blood ties, so we can get married. As long as you're willing, I can marry you."

Seb thought for a moment, then nodded happily. "Okay, then I'll marry you."

"Seb!" Siena hugged him excitedly.

"I can finally marry you!" The dream she had harbored since childhood was finally about to come true.

Soon, she would be Seb's wife, his person.

With the support of Richard's friends, Nina and Isabella Jewelry gradually gained a foothold.

Although Nina didn't know where Richard had gone, she understood that Richard always had her in his thoughts.

Richard might have had some unavoidable reasons for leaving without saying goodbye.

But Nina always believed that once Richard had finished everything, he would come back to her as soon as possible.

What she needed to do now was to manage Nina and Isabella Jewelry well and wait for Richard and Isabella to return.

Margaret often mentioned Sweetie liked to stare out the window in a daze recently.

She was still so young, yet it appeared as though she carried the weight of many burdens, which broke the hearts of the Jose family.

She seemed to have many worries for someone so young, which broke the hearts of the Jose family.

To cheer her up, Nina took some time to go out with Margaret and Sweetie.

They strolled around the amusement park and visited a nearby mall to buy Sweetie some everyday essentials.

Nowadays, Nina and Isabella Jewelry had stores in major malls.

As they passed by one, Margaret suggested buying Sweetie a pair of gold bracelets, so they went in to take a look.

Unexpectedly, they ran into familiar faces.

Siena and Seb were at the counter, picking out wedding rings.

Siena held Seb's arm affectionately, but Seb seemed preoccupied with a stuffed toy, fiddling with it repeatedly, as if bored by the selection of jewelry.

"These wedding rings were personally designed by our manager and are called 'Eternal Love.' They are a new release and very suitable for young couples. Do you think they look good?" the sales assistant asked.

Siena's eyes lit up as she slipped the female ring onto her finger.

She eagerly turned to Seb. "Seb, do they look good?"

###chapter 429 This Baby Is So Cute

Seb gave the ring a quick glance before going back to messing with his plush toy.

Siena, grinning from ear to ear, couldn't stop checking out the ring on her finger from every angle.

As she turned around, she noticed Margaret holding a child, with Nina standing next to her.

Startled, she grabbed Seb's arm. "Seb."

Seb pulled out a bank card from his pocket, and handed it to the sales assistant. "We'll take this pair."

Biting her lip, Siena shot a deliberate glance at Nina's side. "Seb, these rings are really expensive."

"No worries," Seb replied with a naive smile. "If you like them, I'll get them for you."

The sales assistant was about to swipe the card when she noticed Nina and the others, quickly walking over to greet them, "Ms. Miller, what brings you here?"

Nina glanced at the card in her hand and walked over, "Seb, what are you doing?"

Seb turned at the sound and saw Nina, his gaze filled with bewilderment, asking, "Do you know me?"

His question hit Nina like a punch to the gut.

Margaret stepped forward, alarmed. "Seb, what's wrong with you?"

She could sense something was off about Seb instantly since she had known him for years.

She observed Seb's expression and found that Seb seemed different from usual, as if he did not recognize them at all.

Seb studied Margaret for a long moment before saying, "I don't know you."

Then he turned back to Siena, "Siena, do you know them?"

At first, Siena felt somewhat guilty and was a bit afraid of Nina and Margaret, but she quickly masked it.

Seb had completely lost his memory and now viewed her as the center of his world.

What was there to fear?

Smiling sweetly, she replied, "Seb, this is Mrs. Jose, the mother of your best friend Mr. Jose. This is Nina, Mrs. Jose's daughter."

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Nina cut in impatiently, "Seb, I'm Isabella's sister. Isabella is your fiancÃ©e. Now Bella's life is uncertain, and you're here buying wedding rings with Siena. Seb, you really are something."

Nina's words were full of anger, but they didn't stir any reaction in Seb.

Seb was very calm, even finding Nina's agitation a bit inexplicable, "Who's Isabella? I don't know her."

Seizing the moment, Siena stepped forward and smiled confidently.

"Nina, Seb and I are getting married next Monday. I'll send the invitation to your family. I hope you can come to our wedding."

Margaret couldn't believe what she was hearing, so she turned to Seb, "Seb, is this true? You're marrying Siena? What about Bella and Sweetie?"

The originally docile Sweetie, nestled in Margaret's arms, suddenly turned her head, blinking her large, round eyes innocently at Seb.

Sweetie's sincere gaze was like a dagger piercing straight into Seb's heart,Â but he knew he couldn't falter now.Â 

Then Seb stared at Sweetie for a long while before suddenly reaching out to pinch her little cheek. "What an adorable baby."

"Seb," Siena interjected, pulling him back. She didn't want him near Sweetie. "We'll have a baby after we get married. Do you prefer a boy or a girl?"

"Girl!" Seb answered without hesitation.

Siena laughed, clearly pleased. "Then I'll give you a daughter. As many as you want, okay?"

Nina had had enough. Just looking at Seb and Siena made her sick.

Turning away, she said coldly, "You should leave. Nina and Isabella Jewelry doesn't welcome you."

Siena retorted indignantly, "But we're here to buy something. Nina, you opened the store to do business, didn't you? Is there any reason to drive customers away?"

"You're not my customers," Nina snapped icily. "You're my enemies."

With that, she immediately called over two sales assistants to escort Seb and Siena out.

Siena threw down the ring and complained, "You're not even making money. I don't know why you're being so high and mighty about!"

Seeing Siena upset, Seb quickly comforted her, "Siena, don't be mad. We'll buy it somewhere else."

Siena softened, smiling again. "Okay. Thank you, Seb."

The news of Seb's upcoming wedding spread quickly, all thanks to Siena's high-profile social media posts.

She proudly showcased herself on Instagram, trying on wedding dresses, purchasing wedding rings, sending out invitations, and subtly hinting at Seb's name.

By the eve of the wedding, Siena had become quite the celebrity.

On their wedding day, all the local media swarmed the venue, ready to broadcast this bizarre event live.

They believed it would be a big hit.

Jack watched the chaotic scene, his brow furrowed.

Suddenly, Zaire, sitting beside him, muttered, "Bradley is here."

Jack instinctively picked up the wine glass in front of him and walked over with Zaire.

"Mr. Vaughn. Long time no see," Zaire smiled deeply.

"Mr. Jose," Bradley greeted indifferently.

At that moment, a waiter passed by, and Bradley casually picked up a champagne glass from the tray, politely clinking glasses with Zaire and Jack before downing the drink.

Zaire raised an eyebrow, "We have some business to attend to. Make yourself at home."

Bradley found Jack and Zaire rather abrupt; their arrival before him was abrupt, and their departure was equally sudden.

It seemed as if they had materialized merely to share a drink with him.

Siena changed into a white wedding dress and sat in the dressing room waiting.

She was about to marry Seb. The dream she had for so many years was finally coming true.

Siena was all smiles. As long as she became Mrs. Landon, she would have no more desires in this life.

The door behind her was pushed open, and through the reflection in the mirror, Siena saw that it was Bradley who walked in.

Siena immediately turned around and asked, a bit nervous. "Mr. Vaughn, what are you doing here?"

She was actually a little afraid of Bradley.

Bradley was a very scheming person and inherently extremely vicious.

Siena was worried that Bradley would cause trouble, so she hadn't sent him an invitation to the wedding.

But she hadn't expected Bradley to show up uninvited.

###chapter 430 The Video

Bradley, clad in a tailored suit and wearing a faint smile, gracefully approached Siena.

His eyes swept over Siena from head to toe. "How could I possibly miss such a grand occasion as your wedding?"

Siena took a deep breath, hoping Bradley wasn't here to stir up trouble.

She forced a smile. "I'm glad you could make it, Bradley. Seb and I are honored to have you here."

Before she could say more, Bradley grabbed her chin in a tight grip.

He made her look up at him. "If you're so happy to have me, why didn't I get an invite? Do you really want me here, Siena?"

Siena's face went stiff. "Of course," she managed to say.

Bradley clicked his tongue as he fixed his gaze on Siena's lovely face, saying "I was your matchmaker, remember? How could you forget me so quickly, Siena? That's pretty ungrateful."

Siena's heart skipped a beat, and she hastily tried to appease him, "I really forgot to send the invite because I was so busy. Please don't be mad."

"I'm not pissed," Bradley said, his tone icy.

Siena couldn't figure out what Bradley was up to, so she softened her tone and pleaded, "No matter what, I'll always be grateful to you and Mr. Black. Without your help, I wouldn't be here today, about to marry Seb."

"Bradley, if there's anything you need, once I become Mrs. Landon, I'll do my best to help."

Bradley sneered, "Are you scared?"

Siena stayed silent, her face tense.

Bradley released her chin, walked over to sit down, "Don't worry. I'm not here to cause trouble. Mr. Black just wanted me to take some photos of you and Seb."

Siena asked, confused. "What kind of photos?"

"Wedding photos, intimate photos," Bradley said, his eyes lingering on Siena's chest.

Bradley looked down upon Siena, but he had to admit, she had a good figure.

Siena even chose a low-neckline wedding gown to become a trending topic, which was indeed captivating.Â Â 

"We haven't had time to take wedding photos," she said hesitantly.

Bradley waved dismissively. "Go get Seb. I'll take a few shots of you two now."

Siena hesitated. "I'm afraid that's not possible."

Bradley frowned, "Why not?"

Siena explained, "There are a lot of people here today. The Jose family has many members present. Jack and Zaire, being the groomsmen,Â  were always by Seb's side. I can't get him to come over and take photos."

Bradley cast her a sidelong glance, "With you behaving like this, I have no way to report back to Mr. Black."

"What should I do then?" Siena asked, her voice shaky.

Bradley remained silent.

Whenever his gaze skimmed over Siena's breast, She felt a sudden heat rise within her.

Bradley suddenly felt an intense urge to throw Siena down, shred her wedding dress, and make love to her right there and then.

Seeing the dangerous look in his eyes, Siena took two steps back. "Mr. Vaughn?"

Bradley set up the camera on a cabinet, then stood up, unbuttoning his suit as he walked toward Siena.

"Mr. Vaughn, what are you doing?" Siena asked, her voice tinged with panic.

In a swift motion, Bradley grabbed her arm, tossing her onto the bed, then he climbed over her.

"Bradley!" Siena cried out.

But in the next second, her lips were firmly seized by Bradley's.

Siena struggled, managing to slap him across the face.

For a moment, they both froze, then Bradley tightened his grip on her shoulders.

There was a tearing sound as Bradley ripped her wedding dress.Â 

"My dress!" Siena exclaimed, but her words were ignored.

Bradley took the chance to lift Siena's wedding dress and unbutton his pants.

The act of making love lasted over thirty minutes.

When it was finally over, Bradley stood by the bed, straightened his clothes, and walked over to turn off the camera that had been recording the entire time.

The room was dimly lit, with the camera capturing Siena's face in full detail while Bradley's profile remained a blurred silhouette.

Bradley then sent a few screenshots to Quentin, considering his task complete.

Siena suddenly grabbed the camera, and smashed it to the ground.

"Bradley, you bastard!" she yelled.

Bradley frowned, but since the photos had already been sent, he bent down, picked up the broken camera, and casually tossed it into the trash can.

He patted his jacket and tried to comfort Siena. "You're the star today. If your makeup is ruined, it won't look good."

Thinking about what had just happened, Bradley's feelings toward Siena shifted slightly.

Seeing her crying, he couldn't help but reach out to wipe her tears.

Siena slapped his hand away and snapped, "Bradley, remember this. I owe you nothing."

Bradley raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything.

Siena grabbed her phone and saw that there were only five minutes left until the wedding ceremony.

She quickly moved to the vanity to fix her appearance.

Though her dress was torn, it wasn't too noticeable.

She forced herself to compose, touching up her makeup.

What had just happened would be buried deep inside her.

Bradley stood for a moment and then left.

As soon as he stepped out of the room, a sack was thrown over his head, and he was hit on the back of the head, causing him to collapse unconscious.

Ten minutes later, as the wedding march began to play, Siena walked out of the room, stepping onto the red carpet, and made her way to the garden.

A circular spotlight shone on her, and a drone above showered her with flower petals.

Siena walked slowly under the gaze of the guests.Â At the end of the red carpet stood her groom, Seb.

The distance between them shortened, and after today, their lives would be intertwined.

Siena curved her lips into a smile as she stood before the steps.

She lifted her heavy skirt and stepped onto the first step when the music suddenly stopped.

There were murmurs of discussion around her.

Siena paused briefly but continued to walk forward.

This was actually a scene Siena had deliberately arranged to show off in front of everyone.

Tomorrow's media coverage of the wedding would definitely mention this small mishap.

When the media wrote about the mishap, they wouldn't just write about the mistake.

They would also write about how the bride remained composed, and elegant in the face of such an unexpected situation.

It was just a marketing strategy.

According to Siena's plan, the music would resume after a ten-second pause.

What she needed to do now was to maintain her composure and walk confidently.

She silently counted down in her mind.

Siena had successfully stepped onto the last step, her ten-foot-long wedding train trailing gracefully behind her.

She timed it perfectly, planning to take her first step to the music and amaze everyone, but instead, the speakers played the sound of a woman moaning. "Bradley, let go of me."

The crowd instantly erupted in shock.

Siena looked up sharply.

On the giant screen by the pool, footage of her and Bradley's earlier sexual encounter was playing.

Their movements were captured in disturbing detail; their mingled breaths and intimate sounds resonated throughout the venue.

###chapter 431 Quentin's Abandonment Meant Certain Death

Whispers spread like wildfire among the guests, their eyes wide with shock and confusion.

"Oh my God, is that the bride?"

"Is she seriously cheating at her own wedding? My mind is blown!"

"Wait, who's that guy? Is he here too?" someone else chimed in, their heads swiveling in search of Bradley.

At this moment, Bradley had already been knocked out and tightly bound by Jack and his crew, then thrown into a guest room on the second floor.

With no sign of Bradley, all eyes locked onto Siena, who stood frozen on the stage, her knees shaking under their intense stares.

She was overwhelmed by the unexpected turn of events.

As Siena's gaze was fixed straight ahead, she saw Seb standing there, frozen, with the bouquet in his hand somehow fallen to the ground.

He then gave her a look full of disappointment and then turned to leave.

"Seb, wait!" Siena anxiously attempted to intervene, but after taking just two steps, someone inadvertently stepped on the train of her wedding dress.

She stumbled and fell heavily onto the stage.

"Serves her right!" said one of the guests, her voice dripping with disdain.

"I truly can't comprehend it. She's about to get married, yet she still seems so insatiable. Is one Mr. Landon not enough to satiate her desires? Cheating at her own wedding, seriously?"

"I've encountered many women like her."

"She's a disgrace to all of us!"

Struggling, Siena climbed back to her feet, her voice shaky as she tried to defend herself. "It's not what it looks like! This is a misunderstanding!"

But in the clear video, every seductive frame of Siena was clearly displayed.

Who would believe her now when she claimed it was a misunderstanding?

Siena knew that explaining to these people was useless.

What she needed to do now was find Seb and try to win him back.

Siena lifted her dress and walked down the steps, trying to find Seb.

Jack suddenly emerged from the crowd. "Ms. Scott, where are you going?"

Siena said anxiously, "Jack, take me to Seb; I can explain this."

"Sorry, Mr. Landon doesn't want to see you right now." Jack's tone was cold as he called over two waiters and instructed, "Escort Ms. Scott away."

"Where are you taking me?" Siena fought back, pulling her arms from their grasp.

"I'm not leaving. This is my wedding. I am going to become Mrs. Landon!"

With that, she turned and ran, but Jack wasn't having it.

"Catch her!" he ordered.

Several waiters quickly surrounded Siena.

No matter how much Siena struggled, she was eventually taken away.

Afterwards, Jack arranged for the guests to be dispersed, and the Landon family's courtyard returned to silence.

In the guest room on the second floor, Zaire drew the curtains and said to Seb, "Almost everyone has left."

Seb sat on the sofa, coldly staring at Bradley, who was lying on the ground, beaten black and blue.

Zaire walked over and kicked him lightly. "Hey, wake up."

Bradley groaned, slowly coming to.

When he opened his eyes and saw Seb and Zaire, his expression first registered shock, then slowly transformed into a calm indifference.

"Look at you," Zaire remarked, taking a seat. "What did Quentin promise you to make you so loyal?"

Bradley ignored Zaire, his eyes locked on Seb. "So you were faking it all along, pretending to be mentally challenged," he said.

Seb's expression stayed icy. "You're guilty of rape, Bradley. I'll give you one chance to make things right."

"I have no idea what you're talking about," Bradley shot back.

"Doesn't matter if you don't get it. As long as you can read it, that's enough." Seb said, turning on the projector.

The same damning footage started playing on the white wall.

Bradley's face went pale as the realization hit him.

He turned around andÂ glanced at Zaire. "It's that drink which harbors the problem!

Bradley thought, 'How could I have lost control for no reason? Turns out I fell into their trap from the beginning.'

Bradley suddenly recalled something and hurriedly reached into his trouser pocket, but found nothing.

Zaire held up a phone between his fingers.

"Looking for this?" he asked.

Bradley's eyes narrowed.

He instinctively reached for it, forgetting he was tied up and couldn't move.

He struggled to get up but fell back to the ground, writhing like a pitiful worm.

"Give it back to me!" Bradley shouted, his face turning red with anger.

Zaire smirked. "Even if I gave it back, what good would it do you? Quentin won't keep a subordinate who fails."

Bradley froze, as a flicker of fear appeared in his eyes.

With Quentin's temper, if he knew Bradley had messed everything up, he would be abandoned by Quentin-and Quentin's abandonment meant certain death.

After a tense silence, Bradley finally caved. "What do you want me to do?"

Meanwhile, over at Silvercrest, Isabella woke up feeling drained and disoriented.

The drugs they had been giving her left her perpetually drowsy, her mind in a constant fog.

When Isabella slept, she had many dreams.

But when she woke up, she could hardly remember what she had dreamed about.

Amidst the cycle of sleeping and waking, Isabella's mind felt as though it had been washed clean, gradually becoming blank.

Every time Isabella woke from her deep sleep, she felt nothing but exhaustion and confusion.

Isabella stared at the ceiling for a long time before she remembered her name was Isabella, she was from Lakina.

She then remembered Sweetie, Seb, Nina, Kelsey and Miley.

Suddenly, she heard footsteps approaching.

Footsteps echoed from the doorway, and Isabella hurriedly shut her eyes.

The door was pushed open, footsteps approached the bedside, and a chilling aura swept over. Isabella's heart tightened with unease.

Then, a hand gently touched her brow and eyes.

Isabella's body tensed, and she tried to steady her breathing.

"How long has she been asleep?" Quentin's voice sounded.

The nurse beside him replied, "About thirteen hours."

Quentin shot a cold glance at the nurse. "She's still not awake after all this time?"

The nurse trembled with fear. "I'm sorry, Mr. Black. We strictly followed your instructions for administering the drugs, but Ms. Black seems to have a low tolerance. She sleeps deeper each time."

"Useless!" Quentin cursed, then told the nurse, "Go get a basin of water."

"Yes," the nurse answered and quickly left.

Isabella felt Quentin grasp her hand, his thumb rubbing her hand before tearing off the tape and removing the needle.

Quentin wasn't doing this out of kindness; he was probably afraid that Isabella's low tolerance would cause her to never wake up.

Soon, the nurse returned with the water.

Quentin took the basin and placed it beside him, then told the nurse, "You can leave now."

###chapter 432 Continue

The sound of rushing water filled the room as Quentin wrung out a towel and came over to wipe Isabella's face.

She lay there, stiff as a board, pretending to sleep while the warm, damp towel traced her brows, cheeks, and finally her lips.

Disgust churned in her gut.

'Just bear with it,' Isabella thought. 'Quentin'll leave once he's done cleaning."'

But instead, she felt a sudden tug at her collar, followed by a release.

It took her a moment to realize what was happening-Quentin was unbuttoning her hospital gown, his actions smooth and methodical as he continued downward.

The key detail was that she was only wearing this one piece of clothing.

'What is he doing?' She thought.

Isabella's mind was screaming with alarm.

Just as Quentin reached for the third button, she could no longer pretend.

She raised her hand to push Quentin's hand away, opened her eyes, and clutched the open neckline tightly.

Quentin looked at Isabella and spoke calmly, "Awake?"

Wrapping the blanket tightly around herself, Isabella stared at him without speaking, her mind racing.

She knew escape was futile, and fighting would only get her sedated again, so she stayed calm.

Pulling up a chair, Quentin sat beside the bed, watching her intently before asking softly, "Lova?"

Isabella swallowed hard and didn't respond.

Quentin frowned and reached out to touch her hair.

Isabella recoiled in disgust, licked her dry lips, and spoke calmly, "How long are you going to keep me here?"

"Lova, I'm not keeping you here. You just had surgery and need to recover," he said soothingly.

Isabella didn't listen to a word Quentin said.

"I promise you, once you're recovered, I'll let you go immediately. Wherever you want to go, I'll take you," he continued, his voice softening.

Isabella didn't want to see Quentin's hypocritical, self-deceiving face, so she turned her gaze away.

"Quentin," she started, her voice cold and flat, "even with Lova's heart, I'm not her. I'm Isabella. You can't make me into someone I'm not."

Did Quentin think that putting Lova's heart in her body meant she would live on as Lova? Ridiculous!

Quentin didn't care and insisted, "Lova, I know you're angry with me. Don't worry; I'll make you remember everything."

Closing her eyes, Isabella felt a wave of hopelessness.

Quentin wasn't content with losing his mind alone; he had to drag others down to hell with him.

She could never understand Quentin's behavior for the rest of her life.

There was nothing more to say, nothing that would penetrate his self-deception.

Quentin seemed unfazed by her silence, staying with her for over an hour.

Before leaving, he watched as the nurse administered a sedative to Isabella, ensuring she couldn't attempt another escape.

That night, Quentin returned, but he wasn't alone.

Another man accompanied him-a face Isabella vaguely recognized despite the fog of her drug-induced haze.

Isabella's eyes tracked Bradley as she racked her brain, trying to remember where she'd seen him before.

"Lova, do you recognize him?" Quentin asked, strolling closer.

Isabella stared at Bradley but still couldn't place him.

Quentin continued, "He's a student of mine. You recommended him to me back then, remember?"

Isabella was speechless.

Quentin was spouting nonsense.

She didn't even bother to respond.

Bradley stepped forward, his voice measured and slow. "Ms. Black, I'm Bradley."

Isabella frowned, repeating the name, "Bradley."

The name hit her like a jolt-Bradley, Marvin's student, the one who treated Seb with hypnosis?

But now Bradley was here, as Quentin's student?

Isabella's eyes flickered.

Even if she was Â confused, she should have guessed the implications by now.

So, they had been part of Quentin's plan all along!

Isabella gritted her teeth and turned to Bradley, "How is Seb? Have you been treating him under Quentin's orders?"

Bradley didn't dare answer and looked at Quentin.

Quentin's face darkened, displeasure flickering in his eyes, but he held it in.

He turned and instructed Bradley, "Get ready to start."

Bradley nodded, "Yes, Mr. Black."

Before leaving, he glanced at Isabella.

When he returned, he was wearing a white coat, his demeanor now clinical.Â 

"Begin," Quentin commanded.

"Yes," Bradley nodded.

He first went to the window and drew all the curtains, then turned off several lights in the room.

The room dimmed, and Isabella felt a growing sense of dread.

Watching Bradley approach, her voice trembled, "What are you going to do?"

Bradley didn't respond, checking the medical tray before expelling air from the syringe and injecting its contents into her arm.Â 

She knew they were definitely going to do something to her!

But she had no idea what the process would be.

Isabella's terror spiked as she fought to push him away, but it was too quick-a second later, the syringe was empty.

She took a deep breath as she yanked the needle out, blood splattering violently.

She threw the needle aside, ready to fight back, but Quentin lunged, pinning her to the bed.

"Restrain her!" he barked.

Bradley hesitated but complied, securing her with restraints as Isabella screamed and struggled.

"Let me go; let me go!" she shouted.

Tears streamed down her face, mixing with the blood pooling on the floor.

Quentin glanced at Isabella, then at her bleeding hand, frowning deeply.

Then he personally cleaned her hand methodically.

Bradley faltered, "Teacher, she's very agitated. Maybe we should stop."

Quentin threw the blood-soaked cotton ball into the trash, his expression indifferent, "Continue!"

Bradley called in a nurse to reinsert the needle into Isabella's other hand.

But Isabella wouldn't cooperate as she pressed her hand firmly against the blanket.

The nurse's gentle persuasion had no effect.

###chapter 433 Head Broken and Bleeding

Quentin was in the bathroom, washing his hands.

Bradley strolled over and whispered, "I'll take over."

The nurse then handed everything to him and quietly stepped aside.

Bradley gave Isabella's wrist a gentle pat, "Turn your hand over."

Isabella wasn't about to play along.

Bradley leaned in closer, his voice barely a whisper. "If you don't cooperate, Mr. Black will get pissed, and you'll be the one suffering in the end. Trust me."

Isabella stayed defiant, not saying a word.

Suddenly, she felt something strange-a thin, sharp object-slip into her palm.

Bradley had secretly placed a needle in her hand, curling her fingers around it before urgently whispering, "Ms. Black, clench your fist. I'm going to give you an injection."

It was a small but sturdy needle.

Just curling her fingers pricked her skin a bit; if she clenched her fist tightly, it could pierce deeper, embedding itself into her flesh.

Bradley's actions and words seemed to hint at something more.

'Why is he secretly giving me this needle? Is Bradley an undercover agent sent by Seb?' she wondered.

There didn't seem to be any other explanation for Bradley's actions.

A glimmer of hope sparked in Isabella's heart as she thought.

If Bradley was indeed Seb's man, then she had nothing to fear.

"I'll take over," Quentin walked out of the bathroom and, upon hearing Bradley's words, came straight over.

Isabella took the chance to turn her hand over, palm facing down.

Quentin glanced at it, "Clench your fist."

Isabella hesitated for a moment, then decided to comply, clutching the thin needle in her palm.

Quentin, not expecting Isabella to be so cooperative, showed a rare hint of satisfaction on his face.

His gaze softened as he looked at Isabella, "Good girl, Lova. Listen to me, and I won't let you suffer too much."

Isabella's consciousness began to blur.

She instinctively clenched her left hand, the pain in her palm helping her stay somewhat awake.

Suddenly, a sharp crack sounded by her ear, which wasn't loud, but it left her ears tingling.

Isabella's eyes flew open, her entire body drenched in sweat as if she had just been pulled from the sea.

She stared at the ceiling, her body rigid, gasping for breath.

Quentin saw this and immediately turned to glance at Bradley, asking, "What's going on?"

Bradley's heart tightened, fearing Quentin might suspect something.

He quickly walked to the bedside, observed Isabella for a moment, then snapped his fingers in front of her eyes.

When Isabella looked at him, Bradley asked, "Ms. Black, are you awake?"

Isabella, panting heavily, suddenly realized they were trying to hypnotize her.

The reason Bradley had given her the needle was to keep her in pain and prevent her from being hypnotized!

Isabella was almost certain now-Bradley was definitely sent by Seb. "Ms. Black?" Bradley's eyes darkened slightly.

Feigning confusion, Isabella played along. "Who am I?"

Bradley exhaled slowly, relief washing over him.

'Isabella's smart,' he thought.

The hypnosis had just begun.

If Isabella had immediately answered that she was Lova, it would have aroused Quentin's suspicion.

Isabella's question was perfectly timed.

It was as if her memory had been completely erased, leaving her life a blank slate.

Quentin's next task was to fill Isabella's mind with Lova's memories, turning Isabella completely into Lova's substitute.

Quentin interjected, "Your name is Lova Black. You are the eldest daughter of the Black Family."

The entire hypnosis process lasted about forty minutes.

During these forty minutes, Isabella finally understood who Lova was.

Lova, the eldest daughter of the Black family, had been showered with love and affection since birth.

Lova loved ballet from a young age and was an excellent dancer.

Her dream was to study dance at a university abroad and then return to teach.

Lova worked hard for this dream.

But on the day she received her acceptance letter from the foreign university, an accident occurred.

Lova was driving out of her home when she had a car accident.

She didn't hit anyone; she crashed into a guardrail and was severely injured.

Since then, Lova had a leg injury and could no longer dance, which led to her depression.

Soon after, Lova was diagnosed with a strange illness and never left the hospital again.

It wasn't until later that Quentin found a way to save Lova, finally snatching her back from the brink of death.

Isabella listened quietly to thisÂ story.

She thought that if she were truly hypnotized, these memories might be implanted in her mind.

With such long-term hypnosis, it wouldn't take long for her to really believe she was Lova.Â 

'Quentin is absolutely deranged,' she thought.

Isabella was a bit sleepy, so she closed her eyes and fell into a deep sleep.

In the following days, Isabella spent more time awake than asleep.

Bradley and Quentin came to hypnotize her every night.

Isabella no longer resisted; she cooperated by listening to the story and then sleeping.

She would rest and then continue listening to the story.

This cycle repeated for several days.

Until one day, Bradley came to see her alone and she knew her chance had come.

"My time is limited," Bradley spoke quickly in a low voice. "Mr. Landon sent me. Ms. Miller, do you still remember who you are?"

Isabella nodded slightly.

Bradley continued, "Mr. Landon has been here for a few days; he is working on a solution. Quentin was held up today, so he couldn't come. Ms. Miller, tomorrow is the last hypnosis session. You need to pretend to be completely hypnotized. In front of Quentin, you can't show any flaws. Only then will you have a chance to leave here."

Isabella listened to every word carefully and nodded, "I understand."

Meanwhile, at the Black Mansion, a golf club struck Quentin from behind, hitting him hard on the head.

Quentin fell to the ground, his head instantly bleeding.

He turned to see that the person who had hit him was Wade.

###chapter 434 Adopted Son

"Wade!" Quentin yelled, struggling to get up while holding his head.

Wade swung the club again, aiming it right at Quentin.

But this time, Quentin was ready. As Wade lunged, Quentin raised his hand and caught the club.

Suddenly, footsteps echoed from outside the door.Â 

Wade quickly crouched down, clutching his head with both hands, and yelled, "Don't hit me; don't hit me!"

The door burst open, and Bruno appeared at the entrance.

Wade scrambled over and seized Bruno's legs, shouting, "Help! He's trying to kill me; save me!"

Quentin scowled. "Wade!"

Bruno's eyes darted to the club in Quentin's hand. He snapped, "Quentin, what the hell are you doing?!"

Quentin explained, "Dad, it wasn't me; it was Wade..."

"Shut up!" Bruno interrupted. He bent down to help Wade up, holding him protectively.

Â 

Bruno glared at Quentin. "I'm not dead yet! If you want to kill him, you'll have to go through me first."

Quentin gripped the club tightly and hissed, "I wouldn't dare!"

Bruno sneered. "I don't think there's anything you wouldn't dare. Tonight, you're spending the night in the confinement room!"

Quentin bit his lip, saying nothing.

"Dad, save me; he's trying to kill me!" Wade clung to Bruno like a child, trembling all over as if gripped by extreme fear.Wade kept yelling.

Â 

He clung to Bruno like a frightened child, trembling as if he was terrified to the core.

Bruno, fiercely protective, shot Quentin a final glare before leaving with Wade.

As they left, Wade turned back and gave Quentin a cold, triumphant look.

Quentin stood there for a moment, blood dripping from his head.

Â 

He looked down, clenched the club, and a murderous glint flashed in his eyes.

The next day, Isabella was having breakfast.

Â 

Suddenly, the door to the room flew open.

Isabella and the nurse jumped, turning to see Quentin, his face smeared with blood, storming in.

Â 

The bright red of the blood made his face look ghostly pale.

Quentin walked straight over and stood by the bed.

Â 

He glanced at Isabella and then barked at the nurse, "Get out!"

The nurse looked worriedly at Isabella, but eventually left.

Isabella gripped the fork in her hand tightly, unsure of what had driven Quentin to this state.

Quentin sat down by the bed, his gaze locked on Isabella. "Lova," he called out.

Isabella tried to suppress her panic and weakly asked, "Quentin, what happened to you?"

Quentin just stared at her, silent.

Isabella put down the fork and reached out to touch Quentin's cheek, "Who did this to you?"

Quentin raised his hand and held Isabella's, muttering, "Lova, why does Mr. Black never like me? In what way am I worse than Wade?"

Through recent hypnosis sessions, Isabella had come to understand the dynamics of the Black Family.

Wade was Bruno's first wife's child and Bruno's firstborn, while Quentin was just an adopted son.

Between a biological child and an adopted one, most would favor their own flesh and blood.

Â 

Thus, while Quentin was politely called Mr. Black by outsiders, he was never fully embraced by the Black family.

Quentin's sudden appearance in this state suggested he must have endured inhuman torment again last night.

Isabella shook her head and tried to comfort him. "You're amazing. It's just that Dad's way too biased toward Wade."

The anger in Quentin's eyes faded a bit. His voice softened, "Lova, you're the only one who cares about me."

Isabella smiled. "You're the best brother in the world."

Quentin suddenly asked, "Then would you stay with me forever?"

How could siblings stay together forever?

Â 

Even if Lova were still alive, she'd eventually get married, and Quentin would too.

Â 

No matter how close they were, it was impossible for them to be together forever.

Â 

Only lovers could share a lifetime.

Isabella's eyes darted as she saw a glint of obsessive madness in Quentin's gaze.

Â 

Suddenly, she realized Quentin's feelings for Lova were romantic, not brotherly.

Seeing Isabella hesitate, Quentin tightened his grip and pressed on. "Lova, will you marry me?"

Isabella's eyes widened with shock, and for a moment, she didn't know how to respond.

The madness in Quentin's eyes intensified. He continued, "Lova, don't you want to? Don't you like me?"

Isabella shook her head. "But you're my brother."

Quentin retorted, "We're not related by blood, Lova. I'm not your brother; I should be your husband!"

At that moment, Isabella thought of Lova.

Â 

She didn't know if the real Lova had the same feelings for Quentin.

Â 

If she did, it would truly be a tragedy!

"This is a bit sudden," Isabella replied cautiously and lowered her eyes. "I need to think about it."

Quentin said, "Alright. I'll wait for your answer."

The midday sun was scorching, and Wade was playing in the yard with sand.

Esme stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, watching Wade, barefoot and wearing only boxer shorts, playing exuberantly under the scorching sun, his body covered in sand and dirt.

Â 

A cold glint flashed in her eyes.

"Mom." A voice came from behind.

Â 

Esme turned around to see Elodie approaching in a wheelchair.

"Mom, Richard is coming to take me out for lunch later. Can you help me with my hair?" Elodie asked, her face full of happy anticipation.

Since Elodie had returned, Richard had been visiting her almost every day.

Â 

Sometimes he would spend the whole day with her.

Elodie thoroughly enjoyed this, and she was especially looking forward to today's date.

Â 

Esme naturally agreed and wheeled Elodie back to her room to get ready.

After a while, Richard arrived in his car.

Â 

As soon as Richard got out of the car, he saw Wade playing in the yard.

He paused, then walked over and stood a few steps away from Wade, nodding slightly. "Mr. Black."

Wade stopped and gave Richard a silly grin.

Richard stood there, quietly watching Wade.

###chapter 435 I Want My Wife Back Unharmed

When Esme shoved Elodie out, Richard was leaning against the car, puffing on a cigarette.

Richard spotted them halfway through his smoke, then stubbed it out.

Â 

He strolled over and took the wheelchair from Esme. "I got this," he said.

Esme stepped aside, and Richard wheeled Elodie to the car.

Â 

He opened the door, lifted her into the seat, then folded the wheelchair and tossed it in the trunk.

After shutting the car door, Richard turned to Esme. "Mrs. Black, is Isabella okay?"

Esme hesitated, then nodded. "She's fine."

Richard gave a slight nod and got into the car without saying anything more.

As the engine roared to life, Esme cast a wistful glance toward the neighboring sandy area, marked by haphazardly scattered sand and forsaken tools, yet conspicuously devoid of any trace of Wade.

Â 

Esme called over a servant. "Seen Wade?"

The servant looked around. "I think he went to his room for a shower."

Esme's eyes darkened. "Got it."

The servant retreated.

Â 

Esme stood there for a moment, then headed upstairs.

Â 

A bit later, she emerged from the kitchen with a plate of fruit.

Carrying the plate, Esme made her way to Wade's room.

"Wade, I brought you some fruit," she called, knocking lightly. "I'm coming in."

Esme pushed the door open and entered.

Â 

The room was somewhat chaotic, with once pristine white walls now covered in graffiti.

Â 

Sand was scattered across the floor, along with Wade's clothes and socks.

Esme walked in, her eyes landing on the bathroom.

Â 

The sound of running water and faint murmuring came from inside.

She set the fruit plate down, pulled a knife from under it, and gripped it tightly as she approached the bathroom.

She nudged the door open. The bathroom was steamy, and a man lay in the large tub, his face obscured by foam.

Â 

Wade was possibly worn out from playing, his eyes closed as if he were asleep.

Esme tightened her grip on the knife, took a few steps forward, and plunged it into the man's chest!

Blood quickly turned the water red. The man groaned in pain and grabbed Esme's arm.

Esme panicked, yanking her hand back, leaving scratch marks on her arm.

The man in the tub tried to get up, and Esme backed away, trembling. "You brought this on yourself!"

With that, she bolted from the room, locking the door behind her, fearing that Wade might come out seeking help.

After that, Esme hurried away.

Meanwhile, Richard drove to a fancy restaurant.

Â 

He carefully lifted Elodie out of the car and gently placed her in the wheelchair.

Richard had booked a romantic couple's suite, tastefully decorated with a charming ambiance.

After ordering, Richard's phone rang. He glanced at it and said to Elodie, "I need to take this."

Elodie pouted. "What's more important than me?"

"It's work," Richard replied.

"If it's work, can't you take it here?" Elodie shot back, eyeing him suspiciously.

Richard frowned. "You want to listen?"

Elodie nodded. "Yes!"

Richard nodded and answered the call, putting it on speaker.

Â 

A male voice on the other end started talking about work.

Â 

After listening to the lengthy report, Elodie felt overwhelmed.

When the call ended, Richard's expression appeared rather grim.

Elodie tugged at his sleeve. "Richard, are you mad?"

Richard's voice was cold. "No."

Elodie sighed, "I'm sorry, Richard. I just care about you so much. I'm worried you haven't moved on from Nina."

Richard's brow furrowed. "Do you really see me as such a spineless man in your heart? Or that I'd cheat on you?"

"That's not what I meant," Elodie quickly said.

Â 

"You have always conducted yourself with integrity.Since you said you'd take care of me, I believe you. It's just... my legs are useless now, and I'm scared you'll leave me."

Elodie knew how to play the vulnerable card.

Â 

Whenever Richard got impatient, she would speake of her legs, her expression pained and tearful.It always worked.

Â 

Richard indeed couldn't stay mad when she did that.

Regardless of whether Richard felt guilty or genuinely liked her, Elodie was determined to keep Richard by her side, using any means necessary.

Richard's tone softened. "Silly girl, how could I leave you? I promised to take care of you, and I will. If we're going to be together, we need to trust each other, right?"

Elodie nodded. "Yes, Richard, I won't doubt you anymore."

Just then, Richard's phone rang again.

Â 

This time, he didn't rush to answer it but looked at Elodie.

Though she was annoyed, Elodie knew Richard was usually busy, and she had just promised to trust him.

Â 

So, she put on a gentle and understanding expression. "Go ahead and take the call. I'll wait for you here."

Richard smiled and ruffled her hair. "Good girl, I'll be quick."

Elodie nodded. "Okay."

But as soon as Richard left, her smile vanished.

Richard stepped out of the suite and headed to the next room. Inside, Seb and Wade were already seated.

Â 

The tea on the table was steaming, but no one had touched it.

The atmosphere was tense.

Â 

As soon as Richard walked in, Wade spoke up. "Richard, I asked for help, and this is the sort of assistant you bring me?""

Richard said, "Let me introduce you. This is Mr. Landon from the Landon Group."

"I never heard of him," Wade replied with a smirk. "Richard, I need an assistant, not a nobody."

"Mr. Landon is your best option," Richard insisted.

"Oh?" Wade looked at Seb with disdain. "I don't see it."

Seb frowned, clearly annoyed by Wade's attitude.

Without a word, Seb stood up and turned to Richard. "It seems like you're not willing to collaborate with me. Nothing more to discuss"

Richard walked over and patted Seb on the shoulder. "Just hear me out for a sec."

Seb stayed silent, while Wade's mocking grin remained.

"Mr. Landon has the skills, and in Silvercrest, Mr. Black has the connections. You two working together would be perfect," Richard said.

Wade sneered. "Why should I team up with him?"

"Because you have a common enemy," Richard replied, locking eyes with Wade. "You both want to take down Quentin."

Wade's eyes flickered.

Richard continued, "Mr. Black, you've been away for years. Now, most of the Black Family's resources and connections are Quentin's."

Â 

"If you want to win, you need someone capable and loyal. In Silvercrest, you won't find anyone better."

Wade thought for a moment and asked, "Alright, tell me, why does he want to take down Quentin?"

Richard and Seb exchanged a glance.

Â 

Seb sat back down and said firmly, "Because he kidnapped my wife. Mr. Black, let's work together. I'll support you and handle anything you and Richard can't."

Â 

"But I have one condition: I want my wife back, safe and sound."

###chapter 436 Manslaughter

Wade shook his head, dripping with disdain. "After all these years, Quentin's still got the same messed-up taste. He used to be into his sister, now he's chasing another man's wife. In the end, he still fancies picking up what others leave behind."

Seb's face tightened with displeasure, but he kept his mouth shut.

A few minutes later, Seb and Richard walked out one after the other.

Standing by the window, Seb irritably patted his pockets and then asked Richard, "Got a smoke?"

"I quit," Richard replied. "I remember you didn't smoke."

Seb's brow remained furrowed. "I don't know when I started."

Probably since Isabella went missing, Seb hadn't been able to sleep day or night, constantly calculating and walking on thin ice, and eventually, he started smoking..

At first, it was just to distract himself, a way to relieve stress. But he smoked more and more frequently, from an occasional cigarette to six or seven a day.

Â 

Seb never thought he would one day become the smoker he once despised.

Richard looked at Seb, his eyes showing a hint of complexity. He sighed, "Nina and Isabella both hate guys who smoke. You should quit before you find Isabella."

Seb was silent for a moment, then said, "You and Nina, is it really over?"

Richard said, "For now, it has to be."

Seb shook his head helplessly. "I cannot ascertain whether it is favorable or unfavorable when Nina and Isabella cross paths with us."

Richard frowned but said nothing.

The two were silent for a moment before Richard said, "It's about time. I should go back."

"Yeah," Seb nodded. "I should go too."

Richard returned to the private room, where Elodie was still sitting, her face stern and her lips pouting.

Â 

When Richard approached, Elodie didn't look up, just stared angrily at the plate in front of her.

Richard sat down next to Elodie and took the foie gras in front of her, cutting it into small pieces.

Elodie's gaze was involuntarily captivated by him, as Richard's movements were both skillful and elegant.

Â 

The scarred hands that usually held a knife were now cutting foie gras for her.

Elodie questioned, "Why did you take so long?"

Richard turned to look at her, "I ran into some tricky business. It took some time to handle."

Elodie said nothing, just stared at him with a doubtful look.

Remaining composed, Richard carefully placed the sliced foie gras in front of her. "Eat," he said.

"I can't," Elodie murmured, her voice softening. She reached out, lightly touching his hand. "Richard, feed me."

Richard frowned slightly, pausing for a few seconds before picking up the plate.

Â 

He used a fork to bring a piece of foie gras to Elodie's lips.

Elodie gazed at Richard, feeling a strong sense of conquest.

"Richard, coax me," she said.

Richard's lips pressed into a straight line. Though he continued to feed her, his demeanor grew increasingly cold.

Sensing Richard's displeasure, Elodie felt a bit guilty but didn't want to miss such a good opportunity.

Â 

She wanted Richard to submit to her, to lower his proud head and become her most loyal knight.

But she was also afraid of pushing him too far.

Â 

So she gently tugging at his shirt and compromised, "Can't you just coax me a little? I'm easy to please!"

Richard looked at Elodie, his eyes a storm of conflicting emotions.

Elodie urged, "Richard."

Richard lowered his eyes.

Â 

A few seconds later, he looked up, the coldness in his eyes replaced by helpless indulgence. He sighed, "Be good, open your mouth."

Elodie immediately opened her lips and bit into the foie gras.

After chewing twice, she beamed with joy. "It's delicious."

Richard picked up another piece, "If you like it, have some more. I'll feed you."

Elodie seized the moment to kiss him on the cheek. "Richard, you're the best."

"Richard, after dinner, I want to see a movie," she took the chance to make a request.

It was inconvenient at home, and since they rarely went out, she wanted to seize the opportunity to bond with Richard, especially with the atmosphere being so good today.

The hotel had a private cinema.

Â 

She could choose an intimate movie, and the ambiguous atmosphere would naturally follow.

Elodie had it all planned out, and Richard readily agreed.

Â 

But just as they finished eating and were about to head to the cinema, Richard received a call from Bruno, asking him to return to the Black Mansion immediately.

Elodie complained, "What's so urgent?"

Richard's eyes were deep. "I don't know."

The call was from Bruno, and no one dared to disobey.

Â 

So even though Elodie was unhappy, they had to comply and return.

As soon as they entered the living room, they were hit by a stiflingly oppressive atmosphere.

Bruno sat in the middle of the sofa, with a terrified Wade on one side and an indifferent Esme on the other.

In the center of the hall, a long bloodstain trailed from a corpse.

Â 

The corpse was naked except for a towel around its waist.

Â 

The face was pale, lying stiffly on the ground, clearly dead.

Elodie screamed and threw herself into Richard's arms.

Richard raised his hand and patted Elodie's shoulder twice to comfort her. Then he asked, "Who is this?"

Bruno said, "This is the person I sent to protect Wade. He was found dead in Wade's bathroom."

Richard's eyes darkened, and he instinctively glanced at Wade.

Wade was trembling, constantly moving closer to Bruno, looking terrified.

Wade's acting was good enough to fool Bruno.

Richard inquired, "Have you found out who did it?"

Bruno said, "The forensic team has extracted fingerprints from the scene and is comparing them now."

There was another sound of footsteps at the door.

Â 

Wade suddenly hugged Bruno, crying out, "Don't kill me; don't kill me. I don't want anything. I won't fight you. You can have it all!"

Bruno protected Wade and then looked up at the door.

"Mr.Black." Quentin's forehead was bandaged, and he looked quite haggard, as if he hadn't rested well.

Wade kept screaming, "Don't kill me; don't kill me."

Wade's reaction was triggered by seeing Quentin.

Â 

Anyone could see that this had something to do with Quentin!

Bruno, furious, grabbed a cup from the coffee table and threw it at Quentin.

Â 

Because of the distance, the cup hit his leg, spilling tea and leaves on his shoes.

Bruno scolded, "Look at what you've done!"

Quentin looked down at the dirt on his shoes, then looked up.

Â 

His gaze first swept over the corpse on the ground, and he frowned slightly. "Mr.Black, I just got back. I don't know what happened."

Bruno pointed at the man on the ground and asked, "Do you recognize him?"

Quentin shook his head. "No."

Bruno snorted, "Of course you don't. If you did, you wouldn't have mistaken him for Wade and killed him!"

Â 

He was glad he had secretly chosen someone to protect Wade.

Â 

Otherwise, the person lying on the ground would be his son, Wade!

Quentin roughly understood what had happened.

Â 

He didn't rush to defend himself but turned to look at Esme.

Esme sat there, her fingers on her lap curled slightly out of guilt as she met Quentin's gaze.

Richard took in the expressions of Quentin and Esme without a word.

###chapter 437 You're Not My Blood

Before the fingerprint results came in, everyone was hanging out in the living room.

Bruno shot a look at the bodyguard next to him, who then walked over to Quentin and whispered, "Mr. Black, we need your phone."

Quentin was stunned.

Â 

They intended to take his phone?

Â 

As the young master of the Black Family, Quentin had always been the top dog.

Â 

At this moment, being treated in such a manner was nothing less than an announcement to everyone that with Wade back, Quentin had become insignificant.

Quentin stood there for a moment, looking at Bruno.

Â 

He needed to know where Bruno stood.

Bruno met Quentin's gaze with a cold look. "Quentin, please don't blame me for not trusting you. There's too much uncertainty right now. Until we get the fingerprint results, you need to cooperate."

With Bruno's stance clear, Quentin, though reluctant, had no choice.

Â 

He handed his phone to the bodyguard.

The tension in the room was thick, and Esme was already feeling uneasy.

Â 

Bruno suddenly turned to her, noticing her discomfort. "What's up with you?" he asked.

Esme took the chance to stand up. "I need to use the restroom."

Bruno noticed Esme's forehead was dotted with sweat and he could tell she was tense after years of marriage.

Â 

"Go ahead," he said.

"Okay," Esme nodded and left.

In the restroom, Esme locked the door and leaned against it, her legs weak.

Â 

The mirror showed her pale, flustered face.Â 

Wade's face flashed in her mind, and she clenched her fists in anger.

Â 

She screamed inside, 'Wade isn't dead! Despite all those stabs, Wade isn't dead!'

Esme bit her lip, her eyes reddening.

Â 

A knock came from the door, followed by a maid's voice. "Mrs. Black, are you alright?"

Esme quickly wiped her tears, turned on the faucet, and composed herself before opening the door.

Â 

Two maids stood there, stepping back as she came out.

Esme glanced at them and asked calmly, "What's up?"

One of the maids replied, "Mr. Black is worried about you and asked us to check on you."

Esme said, her voice steady, "I'm fine. Are the fingerprint results out yet?"

The maid shook her head. "Not yet, it seems."

Esme straightened up, her emotions more controlled.

Â 

With things at this point, she wouldn't defend herself even if the results were out.

Esme adjusted her mindset and returned to the living room with the maids.

As soon as Esme sat down, the doctor walked in with the report.

Â 

The fingerprint results were out.

Esme's heart, which had just calmed down, tightened again.

Richard's eyes flicked over to Esme's face before locking onto the doctor's as he walked in.

"Mr. Bruno Black, these are the fingerprint comparison results from Mr. Wade Black's room," the doctor said, handing the report to Bruno.

Â 

Everyone's eyes were glued to the report.

Esme, sitting closest, turned her head and saw a long list of names on the report.

Â 

The doctor explained, "In Mr. Wade Black's room, besides his own fingerprints, there are those of several maids responsible for cleaning. There are also many from the deceased. Besides these..."

The doctor paused, not continuing.

Â 

Bruno seemed to have spotted a particular name, his brows immediately furrowing.

Â 

Esme didn't dare to look, just gritted her teeth, waiting for the storm to hit.

Bruno raised his hand and threw the report at Quentin. "See for yourself!"

Quentin was stunned, bent down to pick up the report from the floor, and saw his name at the end.

Bruno roared, "Aside from Wade and the deceased guard, your fingerprints were the most prevalent at the scene, including on the knife, which bore both yours and the victim's prints. Is there anything you wish to say in your defense?"

Quentin pressed his lips together and explained, "Mr. Black, whether you believe it or not, I didn't do this. I never intended to harm Wade."

But Bruno wasn't buying it.

Â 

He snapped, "Enough with the excuses. I put you in charge of the family's affairs because of what happened to Wade. Now that Wade's back, you don't need to handle the Black Group's matters anymore. Tomorrow, go to the company and hand over your duties."

"Mr. Black!" Quentin's eyes darkened. "Are you just going to cut me off like this?"

"It's not me cutting you off!" Bruno said, clearly irritated.

Â 

"You brought this on yourself. If you didn't have your own agenda, I'd have been fine with you helping Wade. But you're too greedy, Quentin! You're not my blood. The head of the Black Family can only be Wade."

Quentin wanted to ask why.

Â 

But in the end, he didn't.

Â 

He simply answered, "I see."

Bruno continued, "The company's affairs are numerous and complex. I'm worried you can't handle them alone. Let Richard accompany you."

Everyone present understood this was to let Richard suppress him andÂ  monitor him.

"Fine," Quentin said, his expression unreadable. "Do you have anything else?"

"No." Bruno waved his hand dismissively. "You can leave."

Quentin clenched his jaw, holding back his anger as he stood up.

Â 

As he walked past the bodyguard, he paused, fixing the man with a cold stare. "Can I have my phone back?"

The bodyguard, trembling, looked to Bruno for permission.

Â 

Seeing Bruno nod, he returned the phone to Quentin.

Â 

Then Quentin walked away briskly.

Richard also stood up, "Mr. Black, I'll take my leave too."

But Bruno called him back. "Richard, come to my study. I have something to discuss with you."

In the study, Bruno was silent for a long time before speaking. "Richard, you should marry Elodie."

Richard was stunned.

###chapter 438 Then Divorce Him

"Now you've seen how things are with the Black Family. With Wade in this condition, I really can't be at ease without someone to help him." Bruno said, leaning forward with a serious look.

Â 

"I raised you, Richard. You're like a son to me. The only difference between you and Quentin is the title, but with Elodie, as my son-in-law, I'll give you the authority you deserve."

Richard stayed quiet for a long time.

Bruno's eyes drilled into him. "What? You don't want to marry Elodie?"

Richard let out a deep sigh. "I've always seen Elodie as a sister. With her legs paralyzed, I'm willing to take care of her for the rest of her life, but marriage..."

Bruno's face darkened, his tone getting more intense. "Richard, you're the one I trust the most. If you don't help me, Quentin will go wild. The Black Family's business can't fall into the hands of an outsider. Or are you still hung up on Nina in Lakina?"

Richard shook his head. "No, it's not that."

Bruno pushed, "Then what's the problem? Tell me, and I'll help you fix it."

"Nothing," Richard said, though his heart felt heavy.

Bruno sat down, his voice firm. "I'll have someone pick an auspicious date. Hold the wedding soon. Richard, don't let me down."

Richard lowered his gaze, his voice barely a whisper. "Yes."

In Lakina, at Nina and Isabella Jewelry, Amy knocked and came in.

Â 

"Ms. Miller, Ms. Murphy is here, waiting for you in the guest room," she said with a complicated look.

Â 

It seemed like she had more to say but held back.

Nina guessed something had probably happened to Ophelia.

Â 

She finished her current work and told Amy to bring some snacks and coffee to Ophelia.

When Nina finished her work and walked into the guest room, she was shocked at the sight of Ophelia.

Â 

Unlike their last meeting, Ophelia was in a terrible state; she had been splashed with red paint, which looked like a pool of blood from a distance, and up close, Nina could smell the paint.

Â 

Her hair was a mess, and her hands were covered in wounds.

Amy whispered to Nina, "She's been sitting like this the whole time. I tried talking to her, but she didn't respond, and she didn't drink the coffee."

Nina nodded. "You can go now."

"Okay," Amy closed the door and left.

Nina walked into the bathroom, grabbed some wet wipes, and handed them to Ophelia.

Â 

Ophelia seemed to snap out of it, then turned her head to look at her blankly.

Nina knew that for someone like Ophelia, who loved dressing up, to look like this, something big must have happened.

Â 

But Nina didn't ask directly. She used the wet wipes to wipe the red paint off Ophelia's cheeks gently with patience.

Ophelia was moved as her lips trembled, "He wants to divorce me!"

Nina's fingers paused, but she kept her face neutral. "Then divorce him."

Ophelia's eyes filled with rage and despair.

Â 

"That bitch is pregnant, and Nathaniel wants me to leave with nothing. He wants to marry her. It's shameless!"

Nina discarded the soiled tissue into the trash bin. "If something dirty messes up your life, you get rid of it. If you can't let it go, you'll just end up dirty yourself. Don't you think?"

Ophelia's eyes flickered with a mix of anger and helplessness. "But I don't want them to win."

Nina asked, "Got a better plan?"

Ophelia's voice turned cold. "Today, I carried a bucket of paint to her place and doused her from head to toe. I had a knife hidden in my pocket, and I intended to end it all with them both."

Ophelia's hand reached into her pocket, feeling the knife through the fabric.

Â 

Her heart felt as if it had been pierced by a needle, radiating a sharp, fine pain. "I truly wanted to kill them, to send them to hell! But then, my son suddenly called me."

Nina felt a pang of relief for Ophelia. "Be grateful for that call. Otherwise, you've might've ended up with nothing and facing jail time. You'd be truly ruined then."

Ophelia's eyes showed a hint of confusion, and then she smiled bitterly.

Â 

"Yeah, I've hit rock bottom. From the moment I was born, I was someone others envied. They envied my background, my family. Later, they envied that I didn't have to work, that I had a good husband and an excellent son."

Â 

"My whole life has been smooth sailing, and I gave all my defenses to outsiders, never expecting to be betrayed by my own family."

Ophelia shook her head with a self-deprecating smile. "To end up like this, it's really something."

Nina reassured, "Good and evil in this world aren't absolute. Such things are hard for anyone to bear. But no matter what, you must remember that you are the victims."

Â 

"You have already been hurt; to place such blame upon yourself would be exceedingly unjust."

Ophelia stayed with Nina for several hours.

Â 

After a good cry, Ophelia's emotions finally began to calm down.

Amy, waiting outside, saw Nina come out and asked, "Ms. Miller?"

Nina instructed, "Prepare a set of clothes and let Ms. Murphy bathe in my office."

Amy asked in confusion, "Ms. Miller, I don't understand. Everyone is saying Ms. Murphy is getting divorced and will be kicked out. And we don't have any business dealings with her. Is it necessary to be so kind to someone like her?"

Nina frowned slightly, "I don't judge people by their value. She's just very helpless right now, like I once was. The difference is, I had Bella back then, but Ophelia has no one to rely on. She's hanging on the edge of a cliff, and I'm the only one who can pull her up. Should I just stand by, or help her?"

Amy nodded slowly. "You're right. I was being narrow-minded."

Nina smiled. "You're just inexperienced. Go prepare the clothes."

"Right away," Amy answered and went to make arrangements.

After finishing her tasks, Nina returned to her office.Â 

Just then, Amy brought in some cut fruit. Nina reached out to take it.

Nina carried the fruit into the lounge, which Richard had insisted on building. She was usually too busy to use it much.Â 

Ophelia was still in the shower.

Â 

Nina walked over and opened the curtains, letting the sunlight pour in.

The phone buzzed. She turned around and saw the phone on the bed.

Â 

The screen lit up, showing a call from Mosterwania.

Â 

The contact name was Alvin Nelson.

###chapter 439 Nauseous

Nina took the phone to the bathroom door and knocked softly. "Ms. Murphy, you've got a call."

Ophelia's voice came through, a bit muffled, "Who is it?"

"It's a guy named Alvin," Nina replied.

Ophelia's tone softened immediately. "That's my son. I can't take the call right now. Nina, could you answer it for me?"

Nina hesitated, thinking maybe Ophelia should call back after her bath.

Â 

But then Alvin called again.

Â 

Knowing he was far away and probably really worried,Â after a moment, she pressed the answer button and put the call on speaker.

Alvin's voice was urgent and fast, clearly worried. "Mom, my leave got approved. I'm booking a flight now and will be back ASAP. Please don't do anything rash!"

Nina waited for a pause and then spoke softly, "Hi, Ms. Murphy is with me right now. She's fine, so you don't need to worry too much."

There was a brief silence before Alvin replied, sounding puzzled, "Thanks for looking after my mom. Who are you?"

"My name's Nina. I'm a friend of Ms. Murphy," she explained.

Alvin sounded grateful, "Thank you. When I get back, I'll thank you in person."

"You're too kind," Nina replied, glancing toward the bathroom. "She's taking a bath right now. She'll call you back when she's done."

"Alright. Sorry for the trouble," Alvin said politely.

"No trouble at all," Nina said before hanging up.

Ophelia came out of the bathroom looking refreshed.

Â 

She invited Nina to go out for dinner.

In the restaurant, Ophelia's face reflected in the glass.

Â 

After a moment, she said to Nina, "I took a bath at your place, and I feel much clearer now. You're right; there's no point in holding on to the wrong person. I've decided to divorce Nathaniel! But I won't leave empty-handed. I will get back the business my father gave him."

Nina nodded. "No matter what, I support you in legally defending your rights."

"Yes, thank you," Ophelia said, just as the waiter served their dishes.

Â 

Ophelia smiled warmly, pushing a plate of grilled fish toward Nina.

Â 

"This fish is the signature dish here. I have savored it for many years and never grown tired of it, so I brought you here today to experience it."

Nina picked up a fork hesitantly. "Shall I give it a go?"

Â 

She took a piece of fish and brought it to her mouth; actually, she was starving now.

Â 

Having been so swamped with work lately, she barely had time to eat.

Â 

Her assistant usually ordered lunch for her, but she only managed a few bites before diving back into work. 

Â 

his was her first proper meal in a while.

Â 

The fish was delicious, but as soon as Nina swallowed it, her stomach churned.

She suddenly felt nauseous and, unable to hold it back, quickly covered her mouth and nose with her hand, spitting the fish into her palm.

Ophelia's face fell with concern as she leaned forward. "What's wrong? Is the fish not fresh?"

Then she picked up her own fork, tasted a piece herself, "It tastes the same as always."

Nina quickly cleaned her hand, looking a bit embarrassed. "Maybe I'm just too hungry. I've been feeling a bit nauseous these past few days," she said, her voice trailing off.

Ophelia observed Nina's weary appearance, took a clean bowl and ladle, and served her some soup. "It's good to be ambitious."

Â 

"But you also need to take care of yourself. It's hard to bounce back if you ruin your health."

She placed the bowl of soup gently in front of Nina. "Try some soup first," she added, her tone encouraging.

"Okay," Nina replied, picking up the bowl.

Â 

But as soon as she brought it to her nose, her stomach churned violently again.

Â 

She quickly put the bowl down, covering her mouth and nose. "Sorry, I need to go to the restroom," she said, her voice tight with discomfort.

Ophelia watched her thoughtfully and nodded. "Alright," she said softly.

Nina stayed in the restroom for about ten minutes. The nausea subsided a bit, but her stomach started to ache.

Â 

She massaged it gently to ease the pain before returning to the table.

Â 

Sitting back down, she grabbed her bag, took out a white pill bottle, and opened it, pouring out two white pills.

As she was about to take them, Ophelia leaned forward, her brow furrowed with concern. "What are those?" she asked.

"Stomach medicine," Nina replied. "I've been feeling this way lately, constantly nauseous or in pain. Taking these pills alleviates the symptoms somewhat."

Nina held the pills in one hand and a glass of water in the other, about to take them when Ophelia suddenly reached out and grabbed her wrist, stopping her.

Nina looked up, surprised, meeting Ophelia's intense gaze. After a moment, Ophelia's expression softened, and she asked gently, "When was your last period?"

Nina was stunned.

Â 

She wasn't naive; she immediately understood what Ophelia was implying.

Â 

But, could it be?

Seeing that she got it, Ophelia let go of her hand and sat back down, her expression still serious.

Â 

"If you're not sure, you should go to the hospital. You shouldn't take any medicine during sensitive times," she advised gently.

Nina slowly clenched her fingers, put the pills back in the bottle, closed it, and put it back in her bag. "Okay," she said quietly.

After dinner, Nina drove Ophelia home.Â 

Since Vilma got pregnant, Ophelia and Nathaniel had completely broken down.

Â 

Nathaniel no longer came home, spending all his time with Vilma.

Â 

Ophelia had been reluctant to return home, feeling that everything in the large villa was an eyesore.

Â 

In her moments of emotional breakdown, she had trashed the place.

But now, Ophelia was determined.

Â 

Even if Nathaniel didn't want a divorce, she did. So, after returning home, Ophelia called a cleaning service to tidy up the house and changed all the security codes.

Â 

She even cut off all the surveillance cameras that Nathaniel could access to.

Â 

This home was now completely unrelated to Nathaniel.

What surprised Ophelia was that when she checked the safe, she found Nathaniel's Social Security card and state ID.

Â 

She didn't know if he had forgotten them or never intended to take them.

Â 

She picked up the items, weighed them in her hand, then put them in her bag.

On the other side, Nina drove home.

Â 

Thinking about Ophelia's words, she couldn't wait until tomorrow to go to the hospital.

Â 

As she passed by a pharmacy, she stopped the car, went inside, and purchased a few pregnancy tests.

Â 

Back at home, she locked the door and went straight to the bathroom.

###chapter 440 Two Lines

Nina followed the instructions, laid the pregnancy test flat, and started timing.

Â 

Just then, there was a knock on the door.

She opened it to find Margaret standing there, holding Sweetie.

Â 

"Nina, Sweetie has a fever. I took her temperature, and it's almost over a hundred degrees. She's burning up. Your dad and Zaire are out of town, and Kelsey is at Jack's place. I'm worried and want to take her to the hospital," she said, clearly anxious.

A child's fever was always scary-it may result in convulsions, seizures, and potentially graver complications such as brain damage.

Â 

Nina touched Sweetie's forehead and frowned, "She's really hot. Hang on, I'll grab the car keys and a coat, and we'll head to the hospital."

She quickly went back to her room to get her things, and then they headed to the hospital.

They registered for the emergency room, drew blood, and waited for the results.

Â 

It was finally diagnosed as a lung infection.

Â 

Considering Sweetie was so young, the doctor recommended hospitalization for treatment.

Margaret was terrified when she heard the diagnosis.

Â 

She grabbed the doctor's hand and repeatedly asked, "Doctor, is this serious? Is it treatable? Sweetie is so young; will there be any lasting effects?"

The doctor reassured her, "It's just a common viral infection. With timely treatment, she should be fine."

Â 

Margaret still looked very worried.Â 

While Nina went to complete the admission procedures, Margaret accompanied Sweetie to the ward, and by the time they arrived, it was nearly midnight.ost midnight.

As Nina pushed open the ward door, Sweetie was already asleep, her small body making the narrow hospital bed seem spacious.

Â 

A cooling patch was on her forehead, and one small hand was tightly gripping Margaret's finger.

Â 

Sweetie appeared so serene and well-behaved, making it heart-wrenching for them.

Margaret sat beside the bed, half-leaning on it, lovingly gazing at Sweetie's sleeping face.

Â 

Hearing footsteps, she wiped her slightly wet eyes and looked up. "All done?"

"Yes, all done," Nina confirmed. "A nurse will come by regularly to check her temperature tonight. If the fever doesn't go down by tomorrow, the doctor will start her on an IV."

"Okay," Margaret nodded. "I've always taken care of Sweetie, and this is her first time being sick. She is still so young; seeing her like this makes my heart break."

Nina squeezed Margaret's shoulder gently. "The doctor said it's a minor issue. Try not to worry too much."

"Okay," Margaret sighed. "It's late; you should go home and rest. You have work tomorrow."

Nina shook her head, placing her bag on the sofa.

Â 

"It's too late to get much sleep if I go back now. Besides, I can't leave you and Sweetie alone in the hospital. I'll stay here tonight and go to work after the doctor checks on Sweetie in the morning."

In the quiet of the night, Nina still couldn't sleep.

Â 

She lay there with her eyes open, suddenly thinking of the pregnancy test she left in the bathroom at home.

She wondered what the result was. She was curious but also felt a sense of relief from avoiding it.

Â 

She wanted to know the result but was also afraid to find out, because she feared disappointment.

A nurse came in to check Sweetie's temperature.

Â 

Nina got up to adjust the room's air conditioning, then poured herself a glass of water, and looked at the hazy moonlight outside.

Â 

She suddenly missed Isabella.

"Bella," she murmured, tears welling up in her eyes.

The next morning, Nina went downstairs to buy breakfast.

Â 

She also picked up another pregnancy test.

Â 

After a night of reflection, she was ready to face the result calmly.

Â 

Back in the hospital restroom, she took the test.

Â 

As the urine slowly soaked the strip and a second red line gradually appeared, her heartbeat and breathing grew erratic.

It was really two lines!Â Nina picked up the test and stared at the two red lines for a long time.

Â 

To avoid any misunderstanding, Nina went to the clinic to get a blood test.

Though the lab results would be ready in just 20 minutes, Nina stood by the printout machine, checking her phone every few seconds, wishing she could fast-forward time.

When the time was finally up, she walked over.

Â 

The screen indicated a report was being printed. She watched as the paper emerged, noting the significantly elevated HCG levels.

Â 

Having been pregnant once before, she knew exactly what this meant.

Nina took a deep breath and brought the report to the doctor.

Â 

The doctor glanced at it, "Congratulations, you're pregnant. Probably over four weeks."

Counting the time, it was right after her last time with Richard.

Â 

Happiness washed over her; this little life had been growing inside her for a month. "Doctor, are you sure?" she asked, still in disbelief.

The doctor looked up at her, misinterpreting Nina's reaction.

Â 

She suggested kindly, "Are you not planning to keep it? I found that your uterine lining is thin. Have you had an abortion before? At your age and with your current condition, getting pregnant again and having such a stable state is already very difficult."

Â 

"If you have another abortion, I'm not exaggerating; it might be very hard for you to get pregnant again."

Nina was stunned and quickly shook her head. "No! I want this baby. I just can't believe it. It all feels like a dream as it happened so suddenly."

The doctor smiled. "That just means you and this baby are meant to be."

Leaving the clinic, Nina sat on a bench for a long time, lost in thought.

She held the report in her hand, thought for a moment, and took a photo to send to Richard.

Â 

Like the countless messages she had sent before, there was no reply.

"Richard, we have a baby," she whispered to her phone, tears of joy streaming down her face. "You must be happy too, right? I'll wait for you to come back. The baby and I will wait for you."

After Sweetie stayed in the hospital for five days and finally recovered, Nina came to pick her and Margaret up.

Â 

During these days, Margaret's mind was entirely on Sweetie and she had been in a state of constant worry.

At this moment, as she carried Sweetie out, Margaret finally had a bit of a smile on her face.

Nina hadn't had a chance to tell Margaret about her pregnancy yet.

Â 

She heard that Steven and Zaire would be back tonight, so she planned to share the news when everyone was present.

Ophelia had been dealing with a divorce case recently, and Nina had been helping her a lot.

When Ophelia heard Sweetie was in the hospital, she came to visit and even brought some gifts.

Back home, Sweetie sat on the carpet, surrounded by a pile of toys.

Soon it was time for dinner.

Â 

The Jose family dining room was aglow with warm light, and everyone had gathered, engaging in hearty discussion, save for Zaire, who seemed lost in thought.

After some small talk, Nina put down her fork and stood up. "I have some news to announce."

Everyone looked at her expectantly.

Â 

Nina paused, gathering her thoughts before saying, "I'm pregnant."

Kelsey was the first to react, jumping up excitedly. "Really? Nina, who's the father?"

Margaret pulled Kelsey back gently. "Who else could it be?"

"Richard's?" Kelsey asked, her eyes wide with excitement.

Nina blushed and nodded. "Yes."

"That's fantastic! Does Richard know? What did he say? Wait, am I going to be an aunt again?" Kelsey practically squealed.

Steven looked lovingly at Nina and suggested, "Nina, sit down and let's talk."

Margaret immediately asked the caregiver to prepare some soup to nourish Nina, who had lost weight from working too hard recently

Kelsey moved closer, reaching out to touch Nina's flat belly.

Â 

She whispered excitedly, "Hello, little baby, I'm your aunt. Are you a boy or a girl?"

Nina was amused by Kelsey, but when she looked up, she met Zaire's grave and profound gaze.

###chapter 441 He Clearly Likes Someone Else

After dinner, Nina was chilling in the living room, chatting with everyone.Â 

Sweetie was nearby, playing with a plush toy.

Â 

Out of nowhere, she crawled over to Nina, her tiny hand grabbing onto Nina's clothes like she wanted to stand up.

Â 

Nina bent down to help her, and to everyone's surprise, Sweetie stood up just like that.

Kelsey exclaimed, "Sweetie can stand on her own! Nina, let go and see!"

Nina slowly let go of Sweetie's hand.

Â 

Sweetie stood there for a couple of seconds before reaching out to grab Nina's knee again.

Â 

She was a bit wobbly, but she did it.

Margaret and Kelsey gathered around with all smiles, showering Sweetie with praise.

"Wow, Sweetie, you're amazing! You can stand on your own now!" Margaret cheered, clapping her hands.

"Seriously, you're the smartest kid I've ever seen!" Kelsey added, leaning in to give Sweetie a quick kiss on the cheek.

Even though she was young, Sweetie already understood people's attitudes.

Â 

Seeing everyone surrounding her with laughter, praise, and applause, she happily crouched her little body, her laughter crisp and innocent, particularly endearing.

Nina picked her up and placed her on her lap. "Sweetie really looks a lot like Bella when she was little," she said.

Every time Nina looked at Sweetie, she was reminded of Isabella when she was young.

Â 

At that time, Bella's parents were absent, and Nina was Bella's only support.

Â 

Now, Sweetie was in a similar situation, but this time, she had the support of the Jose family.

After chatting, Nina went upstairs and saw Zaire at the door of her bedroom.

"Nina," Zaire called out, standing up straight, "I have something to tell you."

Nina walked over and opened the door. "Come in and talk," she said.

Inside the room, Zaire closed the door behind him.

Â 

Nina looked back at him and asked, "Do you have news about Richard?" Her voice was filled with anticipation.

Zaire pursed his lips and nodded, looking serious.

Nina's eyes lit up with hope. "Where is he?" she asked eagerly.

"Silvercrest," Zaire replied.

Nina was silent for a few seconds, her mind racing.

Â 

She then said, "The Black Family is also in Silvercrest. Bella is in Quentin's hands. Did Richard go back to save Bella?"

Zaire frowned slightly, avoiding her gaze.

Â 

Instead of answering, he asked, "Nina, do you plan to keep this child?" His tone was gentle but concerned.

Nina was stunned and nodded, "Of course. Why do you ask?"

Zaire shook his head. "Nothing."

Â 

He knew the hardships Nina had endured in her previous marriage and understood what this child meant to her.

Â 

Zaire found himself at a loss for words.

Seeing Zaire hesitating, Nina couldn't help but worry, her tone becoming more urgent, "Did something happen to Richard?"

Zaire was silent for a moment, then said, "He's getting married."

Nina was stunned, her face lost all colors.

Zaire looked worried and angry. "This news has already spread in Silvercrest. I went to see him, but he didn't give any explanation. As a man, I could tell from his behavior that he clearly likes someone else."

Nina pressed her lips tightly, not saying a word.

"Nina?" Zaire's voice softened, afraid he had said too much and made her sad.

Â 

He restrained his anger and didn't say more.

Â 

He didn't care aboutÂ Richard's well-being, but as Nina's brother, he didn't want to see her hurt emotionally again.

Nina looked up, her eyes calm. "I'm fine."

Zaire suddenly didn't know how to react.

Â 

If Nina had cried or shown any sadness, he could have comforted her.

Â 

But her calm and composed demeanor left him feeling helpless.

He knew Nina couldn't possibly be unaffected.

Â 

She had endured so much pain over the years.

Â 

Despite the warmth of the Jose family and Richard's presence, Nina's sore spot stillremained.

Being betrayed again would only deepen her pain.

Â 

But she habitually hid her pain, not wanting to worry those around her.

Â 

This calmness was both a form of self-protection and a way to hide her hurt.

Zaire was always good at comforting women, but with Nina, none of his usual tricks seemed to work.

Â 

Seeing Zaire standing there, clearly wanting to comfort her but not knowing how, Nina forced a smile and said lightly, "I'm really fine; don't worry."

Zaire was about to say something more, but just then, Kelsey appeared with a tray of fruit.

"Zaire?" Kelsey said, surprised to see him at the door. "Are you talking to Nina?"

"Yeah," Zaire replied, stepping aside to let Kelsey in.

Kelsey walked in with a fruit platter and said earnestly, "Nina, Mom noticed you didn't eat much at dinner, so she had the maid cut up some fruit for you. She also said if you get hungry later, just go downstairs and ask the maid to cook something for you."

Â 

"Don't worry about bothering anyone. You're not alone now; there's a little life growing inside you. You can't go hungry or you'll be malnourished."

Nina smiled softly, "Okay, thanks."

The next morning, Nina got up early.

Â 

As soon as she went downstairs, she ran into Zaire, who had just finished his morning run.

"Good morning, Nina," Zaire greeted her.

"Good morning," Nina responded, taking a towel from the maid and handing it to him, "Wipe your sweat."

Zaire took the towel and wiped his sweat while secretly observing her expression.

Â 

Nina looked very calm, as if last night's news related to Richard hadn't affected her at all.

As she stood at the door changing her shoes, Zaire walked over, asking, "Are you going to the office this early?"

Nina put on her shoes and replied, "Yes. I have a meeting today, so I need to go early."

"Okay," Zaire nodded.

"Then I'll go now," Nina said.

"Be safe," Zaire reminded.

As Nina walked to the door, Zaire's voice came from behind, "Nina!"

She paused slightly and turned to look.

Zaire smiled. "No matter what, Dad, Mom, Kelsey, and I are always here for you. You're not alone. If you're feeling bad, you don't have to keep it all inside."

Zaire, who usually had a way with words in the workplace,Â  found himself struggling to express his thoughts now.

Â 

It was true what they said, "When you care too much, it's easy to get tongue-tied."

Nina walked over, stood in front of Zaire, adjusted his collar, and patted his shoulder. "Seriously, don't worry about me. I'm really fine."

After a moment, Zaire nodded. "Alright."

As he watched Nina leave the house, Zaire let out a sigh.

Nina got into the car and sat there for a long time before finally starting the engine and heading to the company.

Â 

She was a bit distracted on the way and at an intersection, sheÂ almost collided with another car.

Out of nowhere, a fiery red sports car swerved recklessly towards her.

Â 

Fortunately, Nina reacted quickly, turning the steering wheel and braking just in time.

The red sports car also screeched to a halt, its rear end just inches from Nina's front bumper.

Still in shock, Nina watched as the door of the red sports car flew open and a young woman in maternity clothes stormed over, banging on her window.

Nina glanced outside and frowned.

###chapter 442 Ophelia's Kindness Going Unrewarded

Nina rolled down the car window, and Vilma, upon seeing her, immediately became furious. "No wonder my day was so unlucky; it turns out it was because I ran into you."

Nina glanced at her calmly.Â 

Vilma's face was caked with makeup.

Â 

Her belly was still flat, but she was wearing an oversized maternity dress, one hand on her hip, as if she was worried people wouldn't notice she was pregnant.

"What are you staring at?" Vilma snapped, clearly annoyed by Nina's gaze."Do you even know how to drive? You almost hit me just now."

Nina was at a loss for words.

Â 

She sometimes marveled at Vilma's twisted logic.How could she put it? It was beyond what the average person could grasp.

"I've got it!" Vilma's expression shifted dramatically, like she had just uncovered some grand conspiracy.

Â 

"Ophelia must have sent you! Did she send you to run me over? Are you trying to kill me and my baby?"

Nina remained silent. She thought Vilma's reasoning was truly out of this world.

"It has to be! No doubt about it!" Vilma gasped, stepping back dramatically while clutching her waist.

Â 

"She thinks if she gets rid of me and the baby, she can have Nathaniel all to herself? Doesn't she realize she's old and ugly now, and she reeks? How could Nathaniel stand her?"

Â 

"What man doesn't prefer young and beautiful women? What man could put up with his wife who smells bad? Nathaniel told me himself that just thinking about Ophelia's face gives him nightmares for days."

Vilma spoke with a smug look on her face.

Â 

If these words were said in front of Ophelia, it would probably provoke her into fighting Vilma.

Nina, however, remained calm. She quietly listened to Vilma finish, then indifferently asked, "Vilma, are you done?"

Vilma felt that her words were wasted.

Nina, sitting in the car, smiled at her.

Â 

"Vilma, being young and beautiful is your asset, but everyone ages. Besides, I never thought youth and beauty were something to brag about, unless you have nothing else to show."

"Who says I don't?" Vilma snapped, her face contorting with indignation. "I am the founder of Harmony Jewelry."

Nina couldn't help but chuckle at this. "If I remember right, the first investor in Harmony Jewelry was Ms. Murphy."

Ophelia had given everything to Vilma, treating her like a daughter.

Â 

She invested a substantial amount of money in Harmony Jewelry.

But not everyone in this world deserved love, and not everyone knew how to be grateful.

Â 

Ophelia's kindness went truly unappreciated.

"So what if it was her?" Vilma shot back defiantly. "I made money later and bought Ophelia many things. Her relationship with Nathaniel was already broken before I came along. I found out Nathaniel had a mistress before I met him."

Â 

"It was only after meeting me that Nathaniel became faithful. Ophelia should thank me; otherwise, who knows how many of Nathaniel's mistresses would have come to bother her."

Nina realized Vilma didn't even have a normal perspective on things.

Â 

Continuing the conversation seemed pointless, and Nina didn't want to be dragged into Vilma's twisted logic.

So she changed the topic, "Vilma, I'm in a hurry. Could you please move your car?"

Their cars were blocking two lanes, and a lot of vehicles were honking behind them.

Nina was in a hurry to leave, but Vilma raised an eyebrow and provocatively said, "This is attempted murder! How can I let you go so easily?"

Nina was left speechless.

Â 

She mused that her luck must be truly wretched today to encounter such an irrational woman.

Nina thencalled the police. When the police arrived, they took them back to review the road surveillance footage. This took several hours.

In the end, the police determined that it was Vilma's sudden lane change that caused the accident.

Â 

The main responsibility was placed on Vilma.

After dealing with this matter, Nina saw Ophelia on the phone.

Ophelia hung up and walked over to Nina. "Nina, are you okay?" she asked.

Nina replied, "I'm fine. Why are you here?"

Ophelia said, "I was just going to your company to find you when your assistant told me about this, so I came over."

As they were talking, Vilma emerged.

Â 

Ophelia saw her and her expression turned dour, the hatred in her eyes impossible to conceal.

Seeing Ophelia's glare, Vilma visibly shrank back, probably afraid Ophelia might lash out. She took a few steps back.

But then, Vilma's eyes flicked past Ophelia and focused on someone behind her.

Â 

Instantly, her demeanor changed, and she became arrogant again.

Vilma stopped retreating and quickly ran forward.

Â 

She brushed past Ophelia and ran straight into a man's arms, whining, "Nathaniel, you're finally here. Do you know you almost lost me and our baby?"

Nathaniel hugged her and patted her gently.

Â 

The man, in his fifties, spoke to her like she was a child, "Alright, don't be scared. It's okay; I'm here."

When he looked up and met Ophelia's eyes, Nathaniel's face stiffened slightly.

Ophelia's eyes were full of hurt. After so many years of marriage, Nathaniel had never spoken to her so gently.

Â 

How could Ophelia not resent him?

"Nathaniel, I'm cold," Vilma clung to Nathaniel, looking very fragile.

Nathaniel immediately bent down and, like a strong young man, scooped Vilma up and walked away.

Even as they disappeared from her sight, Ophelia's hands remained tightly clenched, her teeth gritted in frustration and pain.

"Ms. Murphy?" Nina called her softly.

Ophelia came back to her senses, her fingers suddenly relaxing, and the hatred in her eyes dissipated.

Ophelia smiled awkwardly and apologized, "Sorry, I dragged you into this."

Nina shook her head and decided to change the subject. "So, did you need something from me?"

"Yes. My lawyer has organized all the documents. Tomorrow, I'll talk to Nathaniel about the divorce," Ophelia said, taking a deep breath.

Â 

"He betrayed the marriage first. I don't think he can refuse my terms."

Nina extended her hand and smiled warmly. "Good luck."

Ophelia shook her hand, her eyes resolute. "It will."

Three days later, Nathaniel and Ophelia finalized their divorce.

Â 

No one knew how Ophelia did it, but she managed to reclaim some of the assets.

Â 

Nathaniel, however, faced significant losses.

To celebrate, Ophelia invited Nina to dinner.

Â 

Unexpectedly, the dinner came with quite a spectacle.

###chapter 443 The Dinner Came with Quite a Spectacle

This was an elegantly decorated restaurant.

Â 

To ensure diners' privacy and personal space, partitions were used to separate the tables, allowing guests to enjoy their meals undisturbed.

Nina and Ophelia had barely taken their seats when an elevated female voice resounded from the next table.

Â 

"Why don't you just kick her out with nothing?"

It was Vilma.Â Ophelia's fingers paused briefly as she flipped through the menu, raising her head to exchange a glance with Nina.

Nina, holding her water glass, put it down and started to signal for a waiter toÂ change their position.

Â 

But Ophelia stopped her with a raised hand.

The conversation next door continued, now with a familiar middle-aged man's voice-Nathaniel.

Â 

"We've been married for so many years, and I wouldn't be where I am today without her family's support."

"Nathaniel, if you care so much about her, you shouldn't have gotten involved with me. I'm not against you giving her money; I just think you're giving her too much," Vilma argued.

"After all, she and I still have a son together." Nathaniel replied.

"And I'm carrying your son too. You only think about them; but have you thought about us? Should my child suffer as soon as he's born?" Vilma shot back, her voice cracking.

Nathaniel tried to soothe her, "You're overreacting. Since I'm willing to divorce Ophelia for you, I won't let you and the child suffer."

"You're just sweet-talking me," Vilma whimpered.

Nathaniel kept trying to calm her down with sweet words.

Nina glanced at Ophelia and suggested, "Should we move?"

Â 

She wasn't scared, just grossed out.

Ophelia closed the menu and was about to stand when Vilma walked over, probably heading to the restroom.Â 

Seeing Ophelia, Vilma's face changed. "Ophelia, what a coincidence! You're here too?" she said loudly, drawing attention.

She called out "Ophelia" loudly, making sure Nathaniel heard.

Sure enough, after some rustling, Nathaniel appeared beside Vilma.Â 

The recently divorced Ophelia and Nathaniel exchanged a brief glance before looking away.

Nathaniel reached out to support Vilma, cautiously saying, "Weren't you going to the restroom? I'll go with you."

Vilma, however, felt that he was avoiding Ophelia.

Â 

Her temper flared as she stood her ground, "Nathaniel, you and Ophelia were once a couple. Even though you're divorced now, you shouldn't act like you don't know her. At least say hello."

Ophelia's eyes narrowed, her gaze mocking. "Vilma, that's enough. Don't flaunt your bad deeds, or you'll get what's coming to you."

Vilma's eyes widened in fear. "Ophelia, are you threatening me and my child?"

"Nathaniel, listen to what she's saying." Vilma whined, clutching Nathaniel's collar.

Nathaniel frowned and turned to Ophelia. "I know you hate me. If you have an issue, take it out on me, but leave them out of it."

Ophelia laughed bitterly, "If you're paranoid, see a doctor. Don't drag me into your delusions."

"I'm not making this up," Vilma shot back, her voice rising and drawing looks from nearby tables.

Â 

Â 

"Can you deny that you told Nina to run me down with her car that day? You wanted to kill me and my unborn child! Ophelia, others might not see through you, but I do. You're the most vicious person I've ever met."

From Vilma's defiant stance, many people may think she was Nathaniel's original wife.

Recently, Nathaniel and Ophelia's divorce had been the talk of the town.

Now, some people in the restaurant recognized them and started filming the scene.Â 

Ophelia felt humiliated. She had always valued her dignity, but now, her last shred of it was being torn apart by Nathaniel and Ophelia..

The atmosphere was thick with tension.

Â 

Vilma kept hurling accusations, and Ophelia was on the verge of losing her temper.

Just as Ophelia was about to stand up and slap Vilma, Nina beat her to it.

Â 

Nina stood up and threw her glass of juice right in Vilma's face.

The world fell silent.

Vilma stood there, her delicate makeup ruined by the juice, dripping steadily downward.

Â 

After a long moment, she grabbed Nathaniel's hand and let out a piercing scream.

Nina raised her hand and called the restaurant manager, "Joshua, could you please ask these two to leave? They're too noisy and ruining my appetite."

Joshua recognized Nina because his boss, Richard, often brought her there.

Â 

So he immediately said to Nathaniel and Vilma, "I'm sorry, but you two need to leave."

Nathaniel's face darkened, and he said to Joshua, "Do you know who I am? You're kicking me out?"

"Please leave," Joshua said firmly.

"Nathaniel!" Vilma protested, clinging to Nathaniel's sleeve and whining, then pointed at Nina, "Make her apologize to me!"

Nathaniel looked embarrassed and cold.

Â 

He knew that the owner of this restaurant was Richard.

Â 

Richard was dismissive of him.

Â 

And now they were being expelled, with no hope of asking Nina to apologize to them.

Nathaniel, holding back his anger, grabbed Vilma's hand, "Let's go."

"I won't go!" Vilma struggled, screaming as she suddenly lunged at Nina.

No one reacted in time. Nina tried to dodge but couldn't, and Vilma's nails scratched her cheek.

Â 

A thin line of blood appeared on her face.

Seeing this, Ophelia stood up, walked over, and slapped Vilma.

Vilma staggered and fell into Nathaniel's arms.

Â 

Realizing what happened, Vilma covered her cheek, glaring at Ophelia, and suddenly burst into tears.

Nathaniel hadn't reacted yet when she clutched her stomach, pretending to be in pain, "My belly, it hurts so much."

Nathaniel immediately panicked, "Vilma, are you okay? Don't scare me."

Vilma collapsed to the ground, and Nathaniel had to crouch down to support her.

The surrounding crowd gathered, taking photos with their phones.Â 

Nathaniel felt utterly humiliated. He had intended to cause trouble for Nina and Ophelia.

At this time, Michael walked over.

Seeing Michael, Nathaniel shuddered and didn't dare to say another word.

Â 

He picked up Vilma and left in a hurry.

###chapter 444 I Wish Him a Happy Marriage

"Nina, you alright?" Ophelia asked, guilt written all over her face.Â 

The thin, long scratch on Nina's face looked quite alarming. She wondered if it would leave a scar.

Nina wiped the blood off her fingertip and said calmly, "I'm fine."

Michael, who had been standing nearby, stepped in. "Too many people here. Let's go inside and take care of it'"

Nina nodded.

Â 

Ophelia knew they had something to discuss, so she said she'd wait outside.

Once inside the lounge, Michael opened the first aid kit and laid out some cotton swabs and disinfectant on the table.

Â 

But Nina wasn't in a rush to treat her wound. Instead, she asked, "Is Richard in Silvercrest?"

Michael glanced at her, looking thoughtful. "You should take care of your wound first."

He then pulled out a tube of ointment from the first aid kit and handed it to her. "This is the best for scar removal. You should use it," he advised.

Nina took the ointment and replied, "I heard he's getting married."

Michael paused but didn't say anything.

Â 

Seeing Nina's calm demeanor made him feel really uneasy, but he had promised Richard not to spill the beans.

Â 

Until things were settled, no one could ensure what unexpected events might occur along the way.

Â 

Since Richard wanted to protect Nina, he couldn't let him down.

Michael's silence seemed like a helpless acknowledgment to Nina.Â 

She tugged at the corner of her mouth, not sure if it pulled at the wound on her face, causing a burning pain.

Â 

"Thanks for the ointment," Nina said. "Could you pass a message to Richard for me?"

"Sure," Michael replied.

She smiled faintly, "I wish him a happy marriage."

Her smile stung Michael. Avoiding her gaze, he said, "I'll make sure he gets your message."

She said, "Thanks."

Nina didn't linger and turned to leave the lounge.

Nina and Ophelia left together.

Â 

Michael closed the lounge door and dialed Richard's number.

After hearing his account, Richard was silent for a moment and then said, "Michael, I need you to do something for me."

Michael said, "Go ahead."

Late at night, Nina was sleepless again.

Â 

She sat up in bed and leaned against the headboard, reading some documents.

Suddenly, there was a dull "thud" from the window.

Â 

The sound wasn't loud, but in the quiet of the night, it was particularly clear.

Nina was startled and immediately turned her head to look, her heart pounding.

Â 

After a moment, she put on her slippers, walked over, and opened the balcony door.

Â 

The balcony was very tranquil. She looked around carefully but saw nothing.

She leaned over the railing and looked down.

Â 

The garden lights below emitted a faint warm glow, exuding a sense of mystery in the tranquility.

Â She stared at the flower bed for a long time but saw no movement.

Â 

Nina felt a wave of disappointment wash over her.Â 

At the same time, she thought to herself with a wry smile.

Â 

'Damn, what am I expecting? Hoping that jerk who's about to get married would suddenly show up in front of me. How stupid can I be?'

She lingered on the balcony for a while, until the night breeze chilled her to the bone, prompting her to step back inside.

Â 

With a heavy heart, she finally went back inside.

However, she couldn't focus on the documents at all.

Â 

Leaning against the soft pillow, Nina gently placed her palm on her lower abdomen and murmured, "Baby, what do you think your dad's reaction would be if he knew about you?"

If it were before, Richard would definitely be thrilled.

But now he was getting married. Would he still care about her and her child? What would her child mean to him then?

Raindrops began to patter against the window, and gradually, a light rain started to fall.

Nina turned to look at the rain outside the window and unknowingly fell asleep.

Two days later, Nina went to the hospital to pick up her folic acid and ran into Vilma.

Nina was at the hospital entrance, where a crowd had gathered.

Â 

Curious, she walked over and saw Vilma half-kneeling on the ground, clutching a man's leg tightly.

Â 

Nina drew closer for a better look; wasn't that man indeed Nathaniel?

Vilma was still in maternity clothes, with various medical reports scattered around her.

Â 

She was crying, "Nathaniel, let me explain. This is all a misunderstanding. It's the hospital's fault for misdiagnosing. You can't blame me."

Nathaniel glared down at her, his voice dripping with anger. "From the beginning of your pregnancy, you've been getting reports from small clinics."

"I asked why you didn't go to a proper hospital, and you said small clinics were more convenient. I never doubted you. And now, I figured out that you are feigning pregnancy."

Vilma clung to his leg, pleading, "I'm innocent. I didn't expect them to deceive me! Nathaniel, I'm still young. We can still have children. Give me another chance, and I promise to give you several sons!"

As more people gathered, Nathaniel looked around and saw Nina in the crowd.

Â 

Feeling ashamed, he kicked Vilma in the stomach and then got into his car and left.

Vilma clutched her stomach and curled up on the ground, trying to chase after him but unable to get up.

Seeing this, the crowd began to disperse.

Â 

A hospital security guard came over and told Vilma, "Miss, you need to move. You're blocking the exit, and other cars can't get out."

Vilma glared at him and snapped, "This is a public road, not your home! I'll sit here if I want. What are you gonna do about it?"

The security guard had seen his fair share of unreasonable people, but this was next level.

Â 

He was speechless. "Fine, fine. Sit here if you want. But don't blame me if you get run over by a car!"

Vilma, looking defiant, retorted, "Mind your own business!"

The security guard shook his head, thinking she was out of her mind, and walked away.

Vilma turned and saw Nina.

Â 

Her eyes narrowed as if she had just pieced something together. She stood up and glared at Nina. "I know! It must be you!"

Vilma's paranoia was acting up again! Nina turned to leave, but Vilma suddenly rushed over.

Afraid of hurting the baby, Nina instinctively took two steps back, her eyes wide with fear.

"You're not going anywhere!" Vilma spread her arms wide, blocking Nina's path like a madwoman. "It was you, wasn't it? It had to be you!"

From afar, Nina hadn't noticed, but now she saw that Vilma also had a long, thin scratch on her face.

Â 

It was even longer than Nina's, nearly reaching her ear.

"I kept it a secret so well, and today Nathaniel suddenly wanted to accompany me to the hospital for a check-up. I knew something was off. It must have been your scheme!"

Â 

Vilma's voice was sharp and accusing as she reached out to grab Nina, but Nina dodged, her heart pounding.

Vilma wasn't about to give up and lunged at her again, her face twisted with rage.

Nina didn't expect her to be so unhinged and stumbled back, her breath catching in her throat as she nearly lost her balance.

At that moment, a hand reached out from the side and gently wrapped around her waist.

###chapter 445 Alvin

Vilma hit the ground hard, causing her skin to scrape and bleed instantly.

Nina clutched her stomach, feeling a surge of fear.

Â 

If someone hadn't caught her just in time, she would've fallen even harder from Vilma's shove.Â 

Nina had a miscarriage; she was not concerned about her own well-being, only anxious that something might happen to the child she carried.

Vilma lay there, glaring, but her eyes quickly shifted past Nina to the man beside her.

Nina noticed Vilma's expression change several times before she hesitantly called out, "Alvin?"

"Alvin?" Nina repeated, turning to see a ruggedly handsome face.

Â 

He was tall and strong, with deep-set eyes that radiated calm.

As Nina checked him out, Alvin looked down at her.

Â 

After helping her steady herself, he stepped back and asked, "You okay?" His voice was calm and reassuring.

Nina nodded, "Yeah, I'm fine."

Â 

She was trying to figure out the connection between Alvin and Vilma.

Ophelia had mentioned yesterday that her son, Alvin, was coming back today.

Â 

Thus, the man standing before her was Alvin?

While Nina was still piecing it together, Alvin extended his hand and introduced himself, "Hey, I'm Alvin."

It really was him! Out of politeness, Nina shook his hand. "Hi, I'm..."

"Nina," Alvin cut in, saying her name before she could. He smiled warmly at her surprise. "My mom's been talking about you a lot lately."

Nina smiled back. "Ms. Murphy mentioned you too. She said you were coming back today. Didn't expect to meet you like this."

Alvin chuckled, "On my way back, I encountered an elderly lady who was having a medical emergency, so I brought her to the hospital. I stayed until her family arrived. I also didn't expect to run into you here."

Nina was a bit taken aback. "You actually dared to bring the elderly woman to the hospital?"

"Why not?" Alvin looked puzzled.

"Aren't you afraid she might accuse you of causing it and hold you responsible?" Nina asked.

Alvin shrugged, still confused. "This is illogical. If it wasn't my fault, I wouldn't be scared. If it was, I wouldn't run. If I truly faced that situation, I wouldn't regret helping. It's a life, after all."

Nina was speechless.

While they talked, Vilma had gotten up, steadied herself, and said, "Alvin, is it really you?"

Her eyes were locked on Alvin's face, astonished.

Nina thought, 'Alvin's quite the looker, tall and obviously fit. Why's Vilma looking at him like that?'

Reflecting on Vilma's past with Nathaniel, Nina started to get it.

Â 

Maybe Vilma just had peculiar taste? She didn't go for young, handsome guys but liked middle-aged dudes like Nathaniel?

As Nina was thinking this over, she noticed Vilma's expression change to one of flattery. "Alvin, it's been so many years. I didn't expect you to change so much. You're so different from before."

Alvin glanced at her, his face staying neutral. "You, on the other hand, haven't changed much."

Vilma blushed and shyly touched her face. "No way. When you went abroad, I was only seventeen. Now I'm twenty-five. How could I not have changed?"

Despite her words, she felt a surge of pleasure, thinking Alvin was complimenting her on still looking young and beautiful, just like eight years ago.

Her delight was short-lived, though, as Alvin's next words hit her like a ton of bricks.

Â 

"I wasn't talking about your looks. I meant your unfaithful heart."

Vilma was stunned.

Â 

Only then did she notice that when Alvin looked at her, his eyes were cold.

Â 

She stammered, "Alvin, why..."

Alvin turned to Nina and interrupted coldly, "I know everything you've done to my mom. Vilma, you better take care of yourself."

Vilma was speechless.

Â 

She thought, 'Ophelia must have said a lot of bad things about me to Alvin. Now, no matter what I say, Alvin won't believe me.'

Thinking of this, Vilma hated Ophelia even more.

Alvin ignored Vilma and said to Nina, "Shall we go?"

Nina was stunned, not quite understanding what he meant, when suddenly a phone rang.

Alvin took out his phone and answered, "Mom, yes, I'm at the hospital. No, it's not me... I'll be back soon. Yes, I'm with Nina. Okay, I'll give her the phone so you can talk to her."

After speaking, Alvin handed the phone over.

During this time, Nina and Ophelia had grown close.

Â 

She picked up the phone, and Ophelia's joyful voice rang through. "Nina, are you free for lunch? I made some food; come over and have some."

Nina knew Ophelia had been looking forward to Alvin's return for a long time.

Â 

At this moment, as an outsider, she shouldn't disturb their mother-son reunion.

Â 

So she gently declined, "I have work at the office, so I can't make it."

"You should come anyway," Ophelia insisted, "I have something to discuss with you."

After a pause, she added, "It's about Richard."

Hearing Richard's name, Nina fell silent.

Nina was aware that Richard was soon to be married; perhaps Ophelia wanted to share this news with her.

Nina knew she shouldn't be curious.

Â 

She shouldn't be trying to gather information about him from others.

Â 

She should calmly say, "I don't want to hear it."

But as she tightened her grip on the phone, she found herself unable to resist.

Â 

Finally, with a heavy heart, she lowered her eyes and said, "Okay."

Ophelia's voice lit up with happiness. "Alright! See you in a bit."

"Okay," Nina replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

She handed the phone back to Alvin, feeling a bit dazed and conflicted

Â 

Â Her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts.

Â 

'Should I go? What if it is some other news?' she thought.

###chapter 446 Crash the Wedding?

After Ophelia split from Nathaniel, she sold their old villa and moved into a house she owned that had been sitting empty.

Â 

This place was right by the river, offering some pretty agreeable views.

Nina followed Alvin inside, and Ophelia came out of the kitchen carrying a dish.

Â 

When she saw them, her face lit up with a smile. "Perfect timing! Alvin, take Nina to wash up for dinner."

Ophelia set the dish down and headed back to the kitchen.

Â 

Nina put down the fruit gift box she had brought and followed Alvin to the sink.

Nina had just turned on the faucet and barely lathered her hands when she suddenly heard a loud "bang."

Â 

Before she could react, she was drenched in cold water.

"What the heck?" Alvin shouted and came over.

Nina was just as confused.

Â 

She raised her arm to block the water and turned to him, "I have no idea," her voice raised over the splashing.

Alvin reached out and pulled her closer. "You okay?" he asked, clearly worried.

Nina nodded, "Yeah, I'm fine."

Alvin took off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

Â 

He then hurried into the bathroom and turned off the water valve.

The bathroom was a mess, water everywhere, and Alvin's T-shirt was soaked too.

He came back out, looking apologetic. "I'm so sorry. I invited you for a meal, yet caused this mess."

Nina shook her head, "Is everything okay?"

Alvin hesitated, then nodded, "Yeah, I'm fine."

Nina paused, a bit confused.

Â 

She had meant the faucet, not him, but it didn't seem like the right time to clarify.

"Alvin, Nina," Ophelia called out as she walked over, noticing their wet clothes.

Â 

She raised an eyebrow in surprise before chuckling. "This house has been empty for too long. I've been here a few days, and something's always breaking. Looks like I'll need to call the repairman again."

Alvin glanced at Nina, concern on his face. "Mom, Nina's soaked. You should take her upstairs to change."

"Right." Ophelia said, quickly catching on. She gently took Nina's hand and led her upstairs.

Alvin grabbed a suitcase from the living room and went upstairs to change too.

Ophelia found a clean dress for Nina. It was brand new, tags still on.

Â 

It was a bit oversized for Nina; fortunately, she still looked elegant in it.

Ophelia looked her over and said sincerely, "You usually dress pretty casual. I didn't expect you to look so stunning in a different style."

Nina cared little for her attire; wiping the droplets from her face, she got straight to the point. "You said you had news about Richard? What is it?"

Ophelia's expression turned serious, a hint of anger in her eyes. "I talked to an old college roommate yesterday and found out Richard is getting married. To Elodie from the Black Family. Did you know?"

Nina felt a pang of disappointment. She had hoped for different news.

Â 

Under Ophelia's concerned gaze, she nodded, "Yeah, I know."

Ophelia asked, "Are you planning to crash the wedding?"

Nina was taken aback, "Crash the wedding?"

"Yes. You're pregnant, right? Richard is the father, so he should take responsibility," Ophelia said, noticing Nina's expression was a bit off.

Â 

"Are you planning to have the baby and raise it alone?"

Nina nodded, "Yeah. I can handle it on my own."

Isabella had been raised by Nina from a young age, back when Nina had nothing and no one to lean on.

Â 

She had survived those tough times. Now that she had family support, raising a child wasn't a big deal.

"But it's not good for the child to be without a father," Ophelia said, concern in her voice.

"No problem," Nina replied firmly. "My child will undoubtedly be strong. Even without a father, my child will grow up just fine."

Ophelia looked at Nina, sensing her determination and maybe a bit of stubbornness.

Â 

She wanted to persuade Nina but felt it might be pointless.

Nina wasn't some fragile woman raised in luxury.

Â 

The experiences she and Isabella had gone through had made her self-reliant.

Now that Richard was getting married, even if Nina cared, it would be hard for her to ask him to change his mind.

Â 

She definitely wouldn't use the child to force Richard not to marry.

Outside the door, Alvin stood quietly, listening to their conversation.

A few days later, one morning, Nina came downstairs as usual.

Â 

She saw Zaire standing at the door with a suitcase by his feet.

Nina walked over and asked, "Zaire, heading out on a business trip again?"

Zaire looked at her and replied, "I'm going to Silvercrest for Richard's wedding."

There was a moment of silence.

Â 

Nina lowered her eyes, her face calm. "Ok. Be safe. Remember to call home when you get there. Mom and Dad always worry when you travel far."

Zaire asked, "Nina, do you want to come with me?"

Nina shook her head decisively. "I have too much work at the company. I can't leave."

Zaire frowned and continued, "Are you really going to just sit by and watch Richard marry Elodie? What about you and the baby once they do?"

Nina frowned, her expression serious. "Zaire, I told you not to mention my pregnancy to Richard!"

Nina was very obstinate, and Zaire didn't dare to go against her wishes.

Zaire sighed, "I won't say anything. I just think Richard might have his reasons."

Nina coldly responded, "Whether he has reasons or not, I don't care."

Zaire wanted to say more, but at that moment, Kelsey came running down the stairs, linking her arm with Nina's. "Nina, I'm ready. Let's go," she urged.

Zaire asked casually, "Where are you two off to so early?"

"We've got a doctor's appointment. I'm going with Nina for her prenatal checkup," Kelsey said excitedly.

Â 

"It's Nina's first ultrasound, and my first time seeing the baby in her belly. Zaire, I'll send you the pictures when we get the report."

Zaire shrugged, "The baby is just a bunch of cells right now. What can you even see?"

"Really?" Kelsey was a bit clueless but found it all fascinating.

Â 

She grinned, "It doesn't matter. Everyone starts as cells, right? As long as I get to see the baby in Nina's belly, I'll be satisfied."

Maybe women were naturally more emotional than men.

Â 

Listening to Kelsey's words, Nina felt a warmth in her heart, saying, "I hope the baby in my belly is a girl."

Kelsey nodded in agreement. "A girl would be great. Girls are more caring. Look at Sweetie, so young and already hugging her mom's neck affectionately. If you have another girl, Sweetie will be very happy."

Nina nodded, "Yeah. They will be like me and Bella."

When Nina talked about the baby, she radiated maternal love.

Â 

Zaire knew she had made up her mind and didn't try to persuade her further.

At the hospital, after Nina's ultrasound, she and Kelsey sat on a bench waiting for the results.

Â 

Kelsey was a bit impatient, constantly checking her watch.

Â 

Nina was relatively calm, but Zaire's words had her a bit lost in thought.

###chapter 447 Going to Silvercrest

"Nina? Hey, Nina?" Kelsey's voice snapped her back to reality.

Nina blinked and saw Kelsey looking at her with concern.Â 

"What's up?" Nina asked.

"I've been calling you several times. You okay?" Kelsey asked, her worry evident. "You are nervous or something?"

Nina chuckled. "Nah, I'm good."

"Want some water? I'll grab you a bottle," Kelsey offered.

"Sure," Nina nodded.

Kelsey dashed over to the vending machine by the elevator.

Â 

Nina watched her go, then felt a gentle tug on her clothes.

Â 

She turned to see no one in the seat next to her.

Nina's hem was tugged once again.

Â 

She looked down and saw a little girl, barely reaching her knee.

Â 

The kid was dressed to the nines, with short, neatly braided hair and a cool expression. She clung to Nina's clothes and timidly said, "Daddy, daddy."

The little girl's clear eyes melted Nina's heart.

Â 

Just as she was about to kneel down, a young woman rushed over, relief washing over her face.Â 

She scooped the girl up. "Sweetie, didn't Mommy tell you to wait on the chair? How did you end up here? You are freaking me out." she said, her voice gentle but firm.

The girl pointed at Nina, "Daddy."

The woman finally noticed Nina and gave an embarrassed smile. "I'm so sorry. My baby gets confused sometimes."

Before the woman could finish, the girl pointed at a passing couple and called the man "Daddy, daddy," louder this time.Â 

The couple turned, the man looking a bit awkward.

The girl got more excited, trying to wriggle free from her mom's arms, waving her little hands, signaling the man to hold her.

Â 

The couple looked mortified.

Â 

The mom had to cover the girl's mouth and awkwardly explain again.

Once the couple left, the girl quieted down.

Â 

But as soon as her mom let go, she started bawling.

Â 

Big tears rolled down her cheeks, making her look heartbroken.

The young mom tried to calm her, but it didn't work, and tears welled up in her eyes too.

Â 

Seeing this, Nina stepped forward, gently patted the woman's shoulder, and asked, "Mind if I try holding her?"

The woman looked up at Nina, eyes wet.

Â 

Nina suggested, "She seemed to want me to hold her earlier. Maybe it'll help."

The woman hesitated but then handed the girl over.

Â 

Nina took her, and the crying slowly stopped. The girl's big eyes blinked, and she still called out "Daddy."

After a while, the girl fell asleep in Nina's arms.

Â 

The young woman looked apologetic and whispered, "I'm really sorry for the trouble."

"It's no trouble," Nina said, handing the girl back.

Â 

After a pause, she asked, "What about her dad?"

The woman looked away, her gaze dropping.

Â 

After a moment, she said, "He passed away."

Nina's eyes softened. "I'm sorry."

The woman shook her head, tears brimming but with a determined look.

Â 

"It's okay," she said, her voice steady despite the emotion. "I can give her everything she needs. The only thing I can't give her is a father."

She sighed heavily. "Sometimes I really regret having her."

Nina felt a pang in her heart.

Â 

She glanced at the child sleeping peacefully in the woman's arms and gently said, "Don't say that. It would break her heart if she heard you."

The woman gave a bittersweet smile. " I know. I love her more than anything and would even lay down my life for her. But it's tough raising a kid on my own, without a father around."

Nina drifted into her thoughts.

Â 

Raising a kid without a father was indeed challenging.

Â 

She didn't know about others, but Isabella's situation was a perfect example.

Â 

Isabella had grown up without parents, so Nina, as her sister, worked tirelessly to earn money and provide for her.

Â 

For a long time, Bella envied other kids who had parents.

Â 

Even if she never said it out loud, the longing in her eyes was unmistakable.

Nina understood better than anyone the importance of parents to a child.

Â 

Nina couldn't help but think about her own unborn child.

Â 

Would her child also long for a father's love in the future? When that time came, how would she explain to her child where their father went?

"Nina," Kelsey called out and returned with the water. "It's about time to get the report, right?"

Nina snapped back to reality and went to get the report.

There were two ultrasound photos, showing a small, round shape.Â 

Kelsey took a few photos of the report and then sent them to the Jose family group chat.

The group chat was buzzing with conversation, but Nina was lost in thought and didn't hear what Kelsey was saying.

Â 

As they walked out of the hospital, Nina suddenly grabbed Kelsey's hand and said firmly, "Kelsey, I need to go to Silvercrest!"

Kelsey was stunned. "What?"

Nina didn't respond; instead, she hurriedly searched online for plane tickets.

Â 

She always carried her documents with her, so going to Silvercrest was just a matter of buying a ticket.

Â 

But for some reason, all the tickets to Silvercrest were sold out today. The earliest ticket was for tomorrow.

Â 

But tomorrow was Richard and Elodie's wedding. If Nina went then, it would be too late.

Nina sat in the car, her sense of despair growing with each passing moment.

"Nina, what's wrong?" Kelsey asked.

Nina put down her phone, leaned back in her seat, and looked dazed. "Maybe this is God's will," she muttered to herself.

Â 

God did not wish for Nina to prevent the wedding of Richard and Elodie.

Kelsey didn't press but smiled meaningfully, "Let's go home."

Nina nodded. "Okay."

Â 

Kelsey started the car and drove toward the Jose family home.

As soon as the car entered the yard, they saw Zaire sitting on a garden bench, drinking tea.

Nina got out of the car, and Zaire walked over.

Â 

"Zaire, I thought you had already left?" she asked in surprise.

Zaire exchanged a glance with Kelsey and replied, "I was supposed to leave, but I was worried you might regret it, so I decided to wait a few more hours. The helicopter can take off at any time. I was afraid you wouldn't be able to get a ticket and would be sad."

Nina finally smiled. "I'll go pack my things now."

Before Nina could take a step, she saw Margaret pushing a suitcase out.

Â 

It was Nina's suitcase.

"Mom," Nina murmured, her eyes brimming with tears.

Margaret handed the suitcase to Nina and gently patted her hand.

Â 

She said gently, "Go. No matter the outcome, you need to make this trip. If things go well, bring Richard back. If not, come back safely. We will always stand behind you, supporting you unconditionally."

Nina choked up, "Thank you, Mom."

Â 

She stepped forward and hugged Margaret, tears streaming down her face.Â 

Nina prided herself on being a strong woman who had weathered many hardships and didn't need to rely on anyone.

Â 

Yet in the presence of Margaret, Nina could not maintain her bravado.

Â 

In front of her family, Nina was willing to reveal her vulnerability, seeking support and assistance.

###chapter 448 I'm Pregnant

Tomorrow was the wedding day. Elodie, too excited to sleep, slipped out of bed while everyone else was out cold and tiptoed into her walk-in closet.Â 

Adorning herself in the pristine wedding gown, Elodie stood before the mirror, gazing upon her reflection with admiration.

The wedding dress was exquisitely beautiful, crafted by a renowned designer from abroad at Richard's behest.

Â 

It was a one-of-a-kind masterpiece, unparalleled worldwide.

She imagined how breathtaking she would look tomorrow, capturing everyone's attention as Richard's bride.

Out of the corner of her eye, Elodie glimpsed the wheelchair in the corner, and the smile on her face faltered.

Alas, despite looking so stunning, she could only make her entrance in a wheelchair.

Elodie spent half the night gazing at herself in the mirror, excitedly twirling in the walk-in closet.

Â 

She didn't notice a faint red dot blinking under the armrest of the wheelchair.

Meanwhile, a helicopter landed on the hotel rooftop.

Â 

Zaire had already booked a private room, but Nina had other plans.

Â 

As she reached the door, she stopped abruptly, "Zaire, I want to find Richard."

Nina was here for Richard, and she craved to see him as soon as possible; otherwise, she couldn't stay calm.

Zaire, understanding her urgency, nodded, "I've arranged for a car. Head downstairs; someone will take you to him."

"Okay," Nina nodded and turned back into the elevator.

The city's lights flashed by.

Â 

The driver, assuming Nina was a tourist, enthusiastically detailed the scenic spots of the city.

Â 

But Nina was lost in her thoughts, consumed with unease, wondering what would happen when she saw Richard later.

Along the way, Nina imagined countless scenarios, but she never thought that Richard wouldn't be there.

A maid greeted Nina.

Â 

She didn't even let her inside, curtly stating that Richard wasn't home and eyeing Nina with suspicion.

Nina didn't say anything and sat down on a bench by the roadside.

Seeing this, the maid turned back into the house and secretly made a phone call.

Nina lingered there for a while, and suddenly, the rain began to fall.

Â 

In no time, the drizzle began to fall, wetting the ground and the bench.

Â 

Nina had to get up and stand under the wall. She tried to stand as far in as possible, but still got a bit wet.

At this moment, a car's headlights flashed, and a car slowly approached.

Â 

The headlights shone directly into Nina's eyes, making her squint and raise her hand to block the light.

The villa's gate opened, and the car drove past her. Nina instinctively took a couple of steps forward.

The car drove into the yard, and the driver got out, pulling out a wheelchair from the back seat.

Â 

Sitting in the wheelchair was Elodie.

Elodie saw her too, her expression mixed with mockery.

Â 

At her signal, the driver pushed her over. She snorted, "Nina? You still came."

Nina always felt guilty about Elodie's legs

Â 

Because of this guilt, she was still patient with Elodie.Â "I'm here to find Richard."

Elodie sneered, "What do you want with him? Do you know he's my fiancÃ© now? You must know that Richard and I are getting married tomorrow, right? Nina, I advise you not to think about ruining my wedding with Richard, or my family won't let you off."

"I have something important to tell him," Nina insisted. "I'll leave afterwards."

Elodie raised an eyebrow, "Oh, really? Well, I'm his fiancÃ©e now, and tomorrow I'll be his wife. Whatever you need to say, you can tell me."

"No way." Nina muttered, shaking her head.

Â 

How could she possibly tell Elodie about her pregnancy?

As they stood in a tense standoff, another car drove into the yard.Â 

Elodie's expression changed at once. "Richard," she called softly.

Richard had rushed back in a hurry.

Â 

Upon receiving the servant's call informing him of Nina's arrival, he abandoned all matters and hastened to return to meet her.

Â 

But what he hadn't expected was that Elodie was also there!

Richard's cold gaze swept over the maid. It seemed Elodie had planted an informant in his house.

He walked over step by step, his eyes falling on Nina's face, his thin lips pressed together without saying a word.

Richard looked so indifferent. Nina's heart was pricked lightly.

Â 

She watched Richard walk past her and go straight to Elodie. Then he crouched down and gently asked, "Why aren't you resting at home so late?"

Elodie glanced at Nina; of course, she wouldn't tell the truth.

Â 

She grabbed Richard's hand, and he didn't avoid her, letting her hold it.

Elodie clung to his hand tightly, her voice trembling, "Richard, I was sleeping well at home, but suddenly I had a nightmare. I dreamed that you abandoned me at the wedding. I was so scared, afraid you really didn't want me, so I came to find you."

Elodie's voice choked, but Nina could tell she was faking it.

Â 

She believed Richard could see through it too. Maybe because of this, Richard didn't respond.

Elodie continued, "As soon as I arrived, I saw Nina. Richard, will you leave me for her?"

Nina looked at Richard. She also wanted to know the answer. Between her and Elodie, he had to make a choice.

Richard's silence stretched on, his expression unreadable.

Â 

"What nonsense are you talking about," he finally replied, his tone soothing.

Nina remembered how he used to speak to her in the same manner-softly and gently, his words soothing her heart.

Â 

She used to think it was Richard's unique way of showing love to her.

Â 

Now, experiencing it firsthand, it was profoundly painful.

Elodie, satisfied, squeezed his hand, "Richard, tomorrow is our wedding. Please tell me you won't leave me."

"No, I won't," Richard said simply.

When Nina was with Richard, she loved looking at his profile.

Â 

She would always lie in his arms, tracing the curve of his profile with her fingers.

This was the first time Nina felt that Richard was so heartless.

Â 

He just looked at Elodie, his profile cold and distant.

Â 

He never once looked at Nina.

Elodie, basking in his reassurance, turned to Nina, eyes gleaming with worry and triumph. "Nina said she has something important to tell you."

Richard gently furrowed his brow before directing his gaze towards Nina, his eyes serene and steady.Â 

Elodie continued to hold Richard's hand as she spoke to Nina, "Whatever you have to say, say it here. Richard and I will soon be married. He won't mind."

Nina felt a surge of nausea and pain at the sight of Elodie and Richard holding hands.

Nina looked at Richard, her eyes full of sorrow, "Are you sure you want me to say it here?"

Richard paused, "Go ahead."

"Fine." A cold smile crept up Nina's face, masking her pain. Richard felt a sharp pain in his heart as he looked at her face.

Nina said calmly, "Richard. I'm pregnant."

###chapter 449 Having 108 Babies All at Once

Nina finished talking, and Richard was left speechless.

He instinctively wanted to move towards her, but Elodie tightened her grip on his hand.

She snapped, "Nina, from the moment you appeared, I had a hunch. You've come to Silvercrest this time with the sole intention of sabotaging my wedding with Richard. Nina, to reach your goal, you even lied about being pregnant. Aren't you afraid of the consequences?"

Nina barely glanced at Elodie, her eyes fixed on Richard. "Do you want to see the test results? They're in my bag." She directed the question at Elodie, but her gaze never left Richard.

Richard stood there, seemingly unfazed.

When Nina pulled the report from her bag and held it out, Richard didn't take it.

A servant, on Elodie's signal, stepped forward, took it, and handed it to Elodie.

It was an ultrasound Nina had just done that day.

The round gestational sac was clearly visible in the image, and the text below stated that the little life was very healthy, with measurements detailed in inches.

The text and images stung Elodie's eyes, but she still didn't believe it.

She scoffed, "You came prepared, Nina. But I bet you've got a stack of fake reports just like this one."

Nina's cold stare met Elodie's. "I don't lie about something like this."

With a look of irritation, Elodie turned towards Richard. "Richard."

Richard had been quietly listening all along. At this moment, he took the sheet from Elodie's hand, gave it a cursory glance, and then casually tossed it aside.

His eyes, hard and skeptical, fixed on Nina. "Are you sure the child is mine?"

Nina's heart sank. "What are you implying?"

Richard's lips twisted slightly. "Nothing, it's just... the dates don't quite match."

His tone was so casual, like a knife piercing Nina's heart.

A dull pain seeped from the depths of Nina's heart, pricking every nerve.

Nina felt a bit unsteady on her feet and took a few steps back.

Nina understood. Richard didn't want this child; he didn't even want to acknowledge it.

Nina wanted to say something, but she felt so distressed that she couldn't find the words.

She had anticipated this outcome, but when reality hit, she was still at a loss.

The scene she had imagined on the way here, where he would be overjoyed upon hearing the news, shattered at this moment.

Richard looked at Nina, a deep pain flashing in his eyes.

His heart ached with an intense longing to go over and hold Nina in his arms, to whisper words of comfort and reassurance.

But he had promised Seb.

Before their plan succeeded, he couldn't afford to let anything go wrong on his end. He clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white as he struggled to maintain his composure. In front of Elodie, he could only endure, his face a mask of cold indifference.

Nina was in a daze for a moment. She wanted to smile but found her lips heavy, unable to even twitch. Half of her body was soaked by the rain; she thought, 'At this moment, I must have looked like a clown.'

Nina came here seeking a definitive answer, and now she had it, though it was not what she had hoped for.

Nina looked up and managed to ask, "So you don't plan to acknowledge the baby in my belly, right?"

"If it's mine, I'll acknowledge it," Richard said flatly.

"It is yours!" She fought to keep her voice steady.

"Then prove it," he said.

Nina was speechless. When she needed to prove herself, the result no longer mattered.

All of Nina's remaining strength was drained. She lowered her eyes and gave a bitter smile. "Sorry to bother you."

Nina turned and walked away. Richard's tense expression softened a bit. As long as Nina left, he could find a way to see her again and explain everything later.

"Wait!" Elodie's voice cut through the rain-soaked air.

Richard's face hardened. Elodie clutched his hand and asked, "Richard, what if she really is pregnant with your child?"

Richard's voice was cold and final. "Impossible."

"What if she's telling the truth?" Elodie said, eyeing him suspiciously. "I mean, Nina came all this way. We can't just send her packing. Why not have a doctor come over and do a quick blood test? It'll show if she's being honest or not."

Richard's voice was icy. "There's no need."

"There is," Elodie insisted, her fingers intertwining with his, her tone soft but resolute. "Tomorrow is our wedding, Richard. I don't want any last-minute surprises. Even if Nina leaves today, I won't feel at ease. If it's all a lie, great. But if it's true? If Nina shows up with the child later, I'll be a laughingstock."

Nina shot back coldly, "Didn't you hear him? He said he wouldn't acknowledge this child. So from now on, my child is mine alone and has nothing to do with him at all. Elodie, don't worry. Even if you can't have children in the future and want to claim this one, I won't allow it!"

"Nina, are you cursing us?" Elodie snapped, gritting her teeth. "I'm younger than you, and this is my first marriage. Besides, I've never had an abortion. What makes you think I can't have children?"

Nina chuckled, "It's great if you can have kids. I came in such a rush that I didn't bring you any gifts. So, here's to you having 108 babies all at once!"

Elodie glared at her, her face darkening.

Was Nina implying Elodie was a breeding machine?

"Richard," Elodie called out, knowing she couldn't win a verbal spar with Nina. Her only card left was Richard.

As long as Elodie used Richard, she could easily hurt Nina deeply.

Richard sighed, "Why bother arguing with her?"

"I don't care." Elodie was determined.

She pressed, "Richard, I want her to take the test here today! I need to know the results to feel at ease! If not, I'll call my dad right now and cancel the wedding."

Richard was silent for a moment before speaking. "If you insist, I guess I have no choice."

He was referring to canceling the wedding.

"Richard!" Elodie's eyes welled up with tears, and her tone softened.

"You know marrying you has been my dream for years. I just don't want any unresolved issues between us after we're married."

"Can't we clear up any misunderstandings and issues before the wedding? After all, marriage is a lifelong commitment."

"You're the one I want to spend my life with. Marrying you means I want to grow old with you."

Richard frowned, his voice still cold. "Then stop making a fuss."

Elodie bit her lip and insisted, "I have only one request: let Nina do the blood test here."

Richard fell silent, realizing that Elodie wasn't going to let Nina off the hook tonight.

If Elodie let Nina go now, there was a chance Nina might vanish later, making the situation even more complicated.

Richard weighed his options and thought this might actually be a good opportunity.

Elodie pleaded, "Richard, please agree. I won't be at ease otherwise."

Richard sighed, pretending to be helpless. "Alright, you win."

Seeing him agree, Elodie's face lit up with happiness.

Nina, however, looked at them with an indifferent expression. "I'm not taking any test!"

###chapter 450: Blood Draw

Nina finished speaking and turned to leave.

She really couldn't stay here any longer.

Every extra second made her feel suffocated and uncomfortable.

Normally, Nina only felt nauseous when she smelled certain foods, but now just seeing Richard and Elodie made her stomach churn.

However, after taking a few steps, two maids blocked her path.

Elodie's voice came from behind Nina, "Nina, let's just cooperate to avoid any future issues, okay?"

Nina turned to look at Richard.

When Nina met the man's eyes, she felt an indescribable dull pain in her chest.

Richard looked at her, "The doctor will be here soon. It won't take much of your time."

In the end, Nina was forcibly made to stay.

After Nina entered the house, Elodie instructed the maids to bring tea and snacks, but Nina didn't even sit down and glance at them, just stood there.

Richard's gaze unconsciously drifted towards Nina.

At this moment, Elodie picked up an orange and handed it to him, "Richard, I want to eat an orange."

Richard glanced at it, took and peeled it.

Elodie ate two slices of the orange and said with a smile, "so sweet."

Richard asked, "do you want more?"

"No," Elodie said coquettishly, "I have to put on makeup tomorrow morning. If I eat too many sweets tonight, I'm afraid it will affect my condition tomorrow."

"My wedding dress is so beautiful, I want to be in the best state to wear it, showing it off perfectly. Only then will I be worthy of you."

"You look good no matter what." Richard casually complimented.

"Really?" Elodie deliberately glanced at Nina, "so, do you think I look better, or does Nina look better?"

Richard's smile froze.

Although he was still looking at Elodie, his brows furrowed slightly, and theÂ light smile in his eyes disappeared, showing that he was unhappy.

Elodie, being competitive, pretended to be pitiful and murmured, "I know my question is silly. If it were before, when my legs were still fine, I wouldn't have asked such a question."

"But now I can never stand again. Richard, I'm a cripple, I feel like I can't compare to anyone."

Richard lowered his eyes, sweeping over her legs, with a flash of displeasure in his eyes.

He paused, then reached for Elodie's hand.

Richard replied earnestly, "I told you, I will take care of you for the rest of your life. You don't need to compare yourself to anyone, just be yourself."

"Richard," Elodie exclaimed, her face full of emotion.

But Richard quickly looked away.

He was looking in another direction, his gaze unfocused, his attention entirely on Nina.

Richard looked over and saw Nina standing quietly, not moving at all.

"Richard," Elodie called him again.

Richard felt a bit irritated. He didn't look at Elodie and coldly asked the maid, "Why isn't Jason Griffin here yet?"

The maid, looking fearful, answered softly, "Doctor Jason is on his way from home, it will take at least twenty minutes."

"Call Jason and tell him to hurry up!" Richard barked.

The maid said timidly, "I already called to urge him."

Richard's impatience reached its limit, "tell Jason to hurry up!"

The maid was about to leave when a man in his thirties, carrying a medical kit, strode in.

This must be the Jason Richard mentioned.

As soon as Jason entered, he sensed the tense atmosphere.

His gaze swept over Elodie and Nina's faces, then cautiously asking, "Who needs the examination?"

Jason had come over as soon as he got the call. Richard had instructed him to do a blood test to check for pregnancy.

On the way, Jason thought it was Elodie who might be pregnant, but upon arrival, he saw there was another woman.

And the atmosphere felt off.

Before Richard could answer, Elodie spoke first, "Jason, this is my friend Nina. Please do a blood test for her. We all want to know if she's really pregnant."

Jason had once been Bruno's private doctor and was later given to Richard. It was clear to everyone that he was just a spy Bruno had placed by Richard's side.

Richard was the standout in Black Family. Over the years, half of the Black Family's achievements were due to Richard.

The Black family should be grateful to Richard, but his outstanding achievements might provoke jealousy or fear within the family.

At the peak of Richard's success, Bruno found an excuse to demote him and assigned him to Lakina to oversee a small casino.

Richard had been quite content in Lakina over the years. Although he wasn't as prominent as before, he was at ease.

If it weren't for Nina and Isabella, Richard probably wouldn't have returned.

Elodie felt assured with Jason conducting the blood test for Nina.

Jason turned to Nina, opened the medical kit, "Nina, please sit down."

Nina took two steps back, looking at Richard with disappointment in her eyes, "Richard, do you really have to do this to me?"

Richard had promised to protect Nina for a lifetime, to love and cherish her, never to abandon or betray her.

Richard had once seen Nina stuck in a loveless marriage and had reached out to help her get a divorce.

But now, those vows still echoed in Nina's ears, and Richard stood before her, the memories of past events flashing before her eyes and then dissipating.

Richard's voice deepened, "Nina, it's just a blood test. Please cooperate, it will be quick."

"What if the blood test shows I'm pregnant?" Nina asked.

Richard pressed his lips together, "I'm confident you are not pregnant."

Nina let out a light laugh.

Nina didn't understand why Richard was so certain she wasn't pregnant.

Nina clenched her sleeves, "I won't do this test, not unless I'm dead!"

The hurt and humiliation she had suffered today were already too much. She didn't want to drag her child into this dirty mess.

"Nina, it's just a test. Why are you so agitated?"

Elodie sighed softly, deliberately provoking Nina with her words, "Are you reacting so strongly because pregnancy is just an excuse, a lie?"

Nina completely ignored Elodie.

Richard frowned and instructed, "Jason, just draw the blood."

Jason responded and approached Nina with the syringe.

But as soon as he reached out, Nina knocked the syringe away.

Elodie immediately commanded the maids in the villa, "Hold Nina down! Don't let her escape!"

Several maids swarmed over. Nina was no match for so many people and was quickly pinned down on the sofa.

Nina's hands were tightly protecting her belly, afraid of hurting the child.

Seeing this, Richard was provoked.

Without thinking, Richard stood up and turn to Nina.

The maids were desperately trying to pull Nina's arms apart, attempting to get one arm free for Jason to draw blood.

But no matter how hard they pulled, they couldn't move Nina's arms.

Nina's hands were clasped together, protecting her abdomen, her arms covered in scratches from the maids' nails.

Richard angrily kicked away the maid who was being the roughest.

Then the maid immediately fell.

"Richard!" Elodie exclaimed.

Elodie was afraid Richard would soften and go to save Nina at this moment.

But after kicking the maid away, Richard placed one hand on Nina's shoulder, grabbed her arm with the other, and pulled.

His strength was clearly much greater than the maids'.

Nina turned to see it was him, momentarily stunned.

In that moment, Nina's hand was pulled out and placed on the table.

The needle pierced Nina's skin, with bright red blood flowing into the tube.

Nina lay on the sofa, her eyes glaring at Richard with unwillingness, finally shedding a tear.

###chapter 451: Let Go of Me

Richard was a decisive man, having served the Black Family for years with some skill, but at this moment, he found himself unable to meet Nina's gaze.

Nina's eyes were like sharp arrows, piercing straight through his chest.

The blood was quickly drawn, and because Nina had been tense, the area around the needle was bruised and swollen.

Seeing this, Richard's face grew even darker.

To avoid being disturbed, Jason went to the guest room to conduct the test.

Nina sat on the sofa, clutching her arm, her face pale.

Richard stood nearby, his eyes fixed on Nina's face, unable to look away.

But after the blood was drawn, Nina never looked up at him again.

About five minutes later, Elodie voiced, "I'm going to the bathroom."

Richard didn't respond, as if he hadn't heard.

Elodie maneuvered her wheelchair and left.

As soon as she was gone, Richard immediately walked to the sofa, squatted in front of Nina, and reached out to grab her hand. Nina gave his hand a wide berth.

She clutched her arm and looked at him, "the blood has been drawn. What more do you want?"

Richard felt a pang in his chest, his Adam's apple bobbing, "let me see your wound."

Nina sneered, "do you want to see the wound on my arm or the one in my heart?"

Richard pressed his lips together and suddenly grabbed Nina's hand.

He used a skillful force, appearing strong but not hurting Nina.

Seeing the needle mark, now even more swollen, Richard frowned.

He thought, 'Jason must be out of his mind to be so rough!'

"Let go of me!" Nina was stunned for a moment; she could feel the pain and tenderness emanating from Richard at this moment.

Nina was all too familiar with this sense which had accompamied her through every passionate night.

But sweetening the pill was no longer suitable for a woman of Nina's age and experience.

If Nina were a little girl, she might easily forgive Richard.

But what Richard had just done had left her heart utterly disappointed.

At least for now, Nina couldn't forgive him.

Nina tried to pull her wrist out of his grasp, but Richard held on tightly.

Richard gave Nina a deep look, then lowered his head, pressing his lips to the bruised area.

In guest room,Â Jason had just placed Nina's blood into the machine when he heard the door open.

He turned around to see Elodie wheeling herself in.

He nodded slightly, "Ms. Black."

Elodie glanced at him first, then her eyes lightly swept over the machine on the table, "how is it?"

"I just put the sample in." Jason replied.

"What are the results?" Elodie asked.

"It will take twenty minutes to get the results." Jason reckoned.

Elodie impatiently raised her eyes, interrupting him, "I asked for the results, not the time."

Jason immediately understood her meaning, "what results does Ms. Black want?"

Elodie smiled with satisfaction, "can you give me whatever results I want?"

Jason lowered his head, "Of course. Whatever you want, no matter how difficult, I will help you achieve it."

"Good. Jason, listen, no matter what the results are, you must say that Nina is not pregnant."

Jason nodded, "I see."

Elodie deliberately went to the bathroom to wash her hands, staying for about twenty minutes before returning to the living room.

She put on a smile, but when her eyes swept over the sofa, she found that both Nina and Richard were gone.

Elodie felt uneasy and angrily asked the maid, "Where's Nina?"

"She went to the bathroom."

"Who took her? Richard?"

The maid shook her head, "No."

"Then where's Richard?"

"I don't know." The maid was also confused.

They could keep an eye on Nina and monitor her every move, but they couldn't follow Richard.

As the master of the house, it was impossible for Richard to report his whereabouts to the maids.

Elodie stared at the sofa for a while, then suddenly asked, "Which bathroom did Nina go to?"

"She went to the bathroom at the far north end of the first floor."

Elodie frowned, "That's the farthest bathroom in the house, hardly ever used. There are several bathrooms on the first floor; why take her there?"

Elodie's eyes were almost murderous, and the maid shrank back, saying, "Mr. Mille ordered it, saying you didn't like Nina and it was best not to let her run into you, so they took her to the north bathroom."

Elodie gritted her teeth and beckoned the maid with her finger, "Come here."

The maid walked over.

Elodie said, "Kneel down."

"Yes, Ms. Black." As soon as the maid knelt down, Elodie slapped her hard across the face.

"Ms. Black!" The maid clutched her burning cheek, tears welling up in her eyes.

Elodie looked at her with disdain and scolded, "Idiot!"

Then, Elodie maneuvered her wheelchair towards the north bathroom, but finding it too slow, she ordered the maid, "Push me there! Quickly!"

The maid didn't have time to be sad and quickly stood up, pushing Elodie to the north bathroom.

The bathroom door was tightly closed, with no sound of water from inside.

Elodie turned the handle, but it wouldn't budge; the door was locked from the inside.

She knocked on the door, "Richard, are you in there?"

There was no response from inside.

Elodie grew more anxious.

She had a nagging feeling that Richard had taken Nina there while she was away.

Elodie went crazy with jealousy, thinking about Richard possibly pinning Nina against the wall and kissing her wildly.

Elodie believed Richard was hers.

After tomorrow's wedding, Richard would be her husband.

Yet on the eve of the wedding, Richard was being seduced by his ex-girlfriend.

If this got out, she would be a laughingstock.

As long as she caught Richard being unfaithful, he would owe her.

Elodie knew Richard well. Part of the reason Richard was marrying her was due to Bruno's pressure, and another part was to protect Nina.

With Nina's appearance, Richard's heart was clearly unsettled.

For a responsible man like Richard, Elodie only needed to do two things to keep him by her side: get pregnant with his child and make him feel forever guilty towards Elodie.

Nina clearly understood these two points as well, which was why she came with news of her pregnancy.

Elodie knocked on the door urgently, making a lot of noise.

The more there was no response from inside, the more agitated she became, her face even starting to contort.

Even the maid was frightened by her expression and tried to calm her down, "Ms. Black, maybe we should wait outside? Nina didn't look well before going to the bathroom; she said her belly hurt."

Elodie glared back at the maid, "Go find the key!"

The maid looked troubled.

Although she was Elodie's inside person, this was Richard's house, not the Black Family's.

"What? You don't take orders from me anymore?" Elodie asked angrily.

The maid, fearing Elodie's punishments, was about to get the key when the bathroom door opened.

###chapter 452: What Else Is There to Say

The maid's body froze.

Elodie immediately turned to the bathroom.

Nina walked out from inside, her expression indifferent as she glanced at Elodie.

Elodie stared at her face intently and aggressively asked, "Where's Richard? What were you doing there? I've been knocking for so long, why didn't you open the door?"

"I don't know what you're talking about," Nina said as she started to walk away.

Elodie raised her hand to stop her, "You're not allowed to leave!"

She then signaled to the maid, who immediately walked to the bathroom door and peeked inside.

"Ms. Black, there's no one else in the bathroom."

Elodie didn't believe it, "How is that possible? Go in and check! Richard must be there!"

The maid didn't dare to disobey Elodie's orders and went into the bathroom.

She checked every corner and, after confirming no one was there, came out to report to Elodie, "Ms. Black, I've checked everywhere. Mr. Mille is not here."

Elodie suspiciously glanced at Nina and said to the maid, "You stay here and watch Nina. I'll go in and check myself."

Clearly, Elodie was afraid the maid might cover for Richard.

So, Elodie maneuvered her wheelchair into the bathroom.

A few minutes later, she came out.

"Nina, where did you hide Richard?"

Nina replied, "Elodie, where do you think I could hide him? You've searched the bathroom. Richard is such a big person; I couldn't possibly flush him down the toilet, could I?"

Elodie raised her hand, about to attack Nina's belly.

At that moment, another maid hurried over, "Ms. Black, Mr. Mille is looking for you."

Elodie's movement paused, turning to that maid, her eyes sharp, "Where is Richard?"

"In the living room." That maid replied.

Elodie and Nina returned to the living room and indeed saw Richard sitting on the sofa.

But he seemed to have changed his shirt.

His pants were the same color as before, so it was hard to tell if he had changed them.

Elodie found it suspicious, "Richard, where did you go?"

Richard glanced at her, "I went upstairs to change clothes."

"Why did you suddenly change clothes?" Elodie pressed.

Richard didn't answer immediately. He stared at her for a moment before saying, "Elodie, even if we get married, you can't have me under your thumb."

She used an excuse, explaining, "Richard, I'm just concerned about you."

"Concerned or suspicious? I know the difference." Richard said coldly.

Elodie felt a bit embarrassed but didn't dare to say more, worried she might make Richard completely unhappy.

Elodie glanced at the time, "In five minutes, the blood test results will be out."

Once the results were out, she would immediately kick Nina out.

And Richard would never see Nina again!

Nina felt a vague unease upon hearing this.

Suddenly, Nina sensed a gaze on her. She looked up atÂ Richard, but he wasn't looking at Nina; he was playing with his phone.

Elodie peeked, finding Richard playing a very old single-player game.

Various shapes of blocks were falling from the top of the screen. He quickly switched directions and dropped the blocks. Each block fell perfectly into place, disappearing as soon as a row was filled.

This was a little-known habit of Richard's. Whenever he had something on his mind, he would play this game for a while.

It seemed like he was playing a game, but he was planning other things in his mind.

This unique little habit was known only to his closest people, Michael and Nina.

It was the first time Elodie had seen it.

Elodie watched for a while, then feeling bored, she averted her gaze.

As Richard played the game, his thoughts drifted back to a few minutes earlier.

He had deliberately sent Nina to the farthest bathroom to arouse Elodie's suspicion, thus buying himself time to meet Jason alone.

Jason was slightly surprised by Richard's arrival. He nodded respectfully and had just called out "Mr. Mille" when a cold dagger was pressed against his neck.

Jason raised his hands to his chest, "Mr. Mille, what are you doing?"

Richard growled, "Jason, I need to protect Nina."

Jason was immediately troubled.

It seemed Richard also wanted him to alter the blood test results.

Elodie wanted him to say Nina wasn't pregnant, and what about Richard?

Jason knew a bit about why Richard was marrying Elodie.

If Richard could use Nina's pregnancy to call off the wedding, it would be a rare opportunity.

The problem was that Jason didn't want to offend either the Black Family or Richard.

One was openly ruthless, the other secretly so.

In fact, Richard's methods were even more ruthless than the Black Family's.

Over the years, Jason had managed to stay safe between the them by not offending either side.

But Jason knew that one day danger would belay him, and now was the time.

Richard told Jason firmly, "Listen, no matter what the real result is, you can only announce that Nina is not pregnant."

Jason was puzzled, "Mr. Mille, are you sure you want Nina to not be pregnant?"

Jason thought, 'Why is Richard's request the same as Elodie's?'

The knife in Richard's hand grazed Jason's skin. The blade was extremely sharp, and with just a slight pressure, it left a cut on Jason's neck.

Feeling pain in his neck, Jason quickly agreed, "Okay, I can definitely do this."

Richard narrowed his eyes slightly, "Jason, if you dare betray me, you know what will happen."

"I know. Don't worry. I'll say what you want me to say." Sweat was already forming on Jason's forehead.

The blade was pressed tightly against his wound, forcing him to tilt his head back, making Jason quite afraid and hard.

As they talked, a drop of blood trickled down the blade. Richard couldn't dodge it, and it landed right on his sleeve.

To avoid arousing Elodie's suspicion, Richard had to quickly go upstairs to change his clothes.

"Mr. Mille, the blood test results are out," Jason murmured submissively.

As soon as Jason appeared, three pairs of eyes turned to him.

Jason cleared his throat and walked briskly to Richard, handing him the blood test report and reporting, "The blood test results are out. The data shows that Nina is not pregnant."

With satisfaction flashed in Elodie's eyes, Elodie immediately looked at Richard, only to see him gripping the thin piece of paper tightly, his eyes seemingly glued to it, staring intently.

Those few lines of text had probably been read dozens of times by Richard.

Richard showed almost no reaction, only a coldness and a hint of disappointment emanating from him.

Elodie thought Richard must have believed the results.

This was Richard's normal reaction!

Richard slowly looked up at Nina on the sofa, his tone and gaze equally cold, "Do you have anything to say?"

###chapter 453: The Result

Nina's lips trembled slightly as she slowly stood up from the sofa, "How is that possible? I'm clearly pregnant. I had a blood test and other examinations done at Lakina, even an ultrasound."

There was indeed a little life inside her. How could it be gone now that she's at Silvercrest?

Elodie sneered, "Jason is a nationally renowned doctor. Are you questioning his abilities?"

Nina looked at Jason. It was true he had a stellar reputation, but he was also part of the Black Family, taking orders from them.

Her test results didn't depend on the instruments and data, but on Jason's words.

Nina smiled indifferently, "Whatever."

She didn't want to do the test in the first place; they had forced her into it.

Now they were using the negative result to insult her.

Arguing was useless and meaningless. She just wanted to end this farce quickly and leave.

Nina asked, "Can I leave now?"

"Of course." Elodie smiled, "Since everything is clear, and Nina's pregnancy is fake, there's no need to keep you here."

"Just one thing, tomorrow is my wedding with Richard. I don't expect you to sincerely bless us, but I hope you won't pull a stunt like today again."

Nina had already reached the door. She paused slightly then sneered, "Don't worry."

Then Nina strode out of the villa.

Richard watched Nina run out, his body slightly stiff.

Suddenly, Richard's fingertips softened, as Elodie held his hand. Elodie saying tenderly, "Richard, can I stay with you tonight?"

Richard frowned slightly, "No."

"Why not? We're getting married tomorrow. Can't I rest here tonight? It's so late, do you really want to send me away?" Elodie asked sorrowfully.

Richard still frowned, "Elodie, the wedding is tomorrow. At least for tonight, we are not married. It's not proper for you to stay here."

"I don't care. I'm staying here tonight." With that, Elodie ignored Richard's expression and told the maid, "Prepare a guest room for me."

"Elodie!" Richard's voice was cold.

Elodie yawned, "I've been up all night, and I'm tired. I have to get up early tomorrow. Richard, I'm going to sleep now. Good night."

Elodie had just laid down when a maid knocked on the door to bring hot milk.

Elodie glanced at it, then replied indifferently, "Just leave it. I'm not hungry."

"Mr. Mille made it himself. He said a cup of hot milk at night helps you sleep well."

Elodie raised an eyebrow, "Richard made it himself? Then I must try it. Bring it over."

The maid carefully handed the cup over to Elodie.

Elodie reached for it but spilled the milk in her haste, wetting her sleeve and the bedding.

Elodie frowned and instructed the maid, "Get me a towel, quickly."

"Yes, Ms. Black." The maid hurried to the bathroom.

When she came out, Elodie was still in the same position, leaning against the headboard.

The maid handed over the towel and glanced at the milk cup on the nightstand, pausing slightly.

The cup was now empty, with only a bit of milk residue at the bottom.

Elodie said, "I've finished the milk. I'm feeling very sleepy now. You can go."

The maid didn't dare to question,then took the empty cup downstairs.

Richard was downstairs. Seeing the maid with the empty cup, he knew Elodie had drunk the milk.

He had put some sleeping pills in it, enough for Elodie to have a good night's sleep.

Grabbing his car keys and coat, Richard headed straight out the door.

As he opened the door, Jason was waiting outside.

"Mr. Mille." Jason walked over and pulled a report from his pocket, "This is the real result of Nina's blood test."

Richard took and glanced at it, saying, "I know. She's not one to lie."

Richard carefully folded the report and put it in his pocket as if it were the most precious treasure in the world.

After securing it, Richard started to leave.

Jason suddenly raised his hand, blocking his way, "Mr. Mille, I want to remind you, if Bruno finds out what you're doing..."

"I won't let him know!" Richard snapped, his cold eyes sweeping over Jason's face, "Unless you tell him."

Jason shrugged, "By giving you this report, we are bound together."

Richard looked at Jason, half-believing his words.

Jason lowered his hand, "Mr. Mille, can I ask you a favor?"

"Go ahead." Richard looked at him curiously.

"When you turn against the Black Family, let me add insult to injury to them."

Richard's eyes showed suspicion, "If I remember correctly, the Black Family has been good to you. Are you really going to bite the hand that fed you?"

Jason's smile turned cold, "The Black Family's kindness to me was from Lova. As for the others..."

Richard didn't know the details between Jason and the Black Family, but after being with him for so many years, he knew Jason believed in tit for tat.

Richard said, "I won't act against the Black Family."

Bruno had been kind to Richard.

Years ago, when Richard was desperate, it was Bruno who saved him. Without Bruno, Richard wouldn't be here today.

That was why Richard had been so loyal to the Black Family, fighting desperately for them.

Richard agreed to help Seb rescue Isabella but wouldn't act against the Black Family.

Jason still smiled, "I said if."

"There is no if. I won't act against the Black Family." Richard pushed past Jason and walked away.

Jason stood under the moonlight, still smiling faintly.

He watched Richard drive away, then slowly looked up to see Elodie standing on the second-floor balcony.

Elodie looked down at him.

"Jason, get up here!" Elodie commanded sharply.

Jason smiled lightly, followed by heading upstairs.

He stood behind Elodie, "Ms. Black."

Elodie suddenly turned and slapped him.

The slap was so hard that Jason's cheek quickly felt a burning sensation, but he stood still.

"Useless! Did you just give Richard Nina's blood test report?" Elodie asked angrily.

Jason replied, "Yes."

"Why did you give it to him?" Elodie raised her hand to slap him again, but this time Jason easily caught it mid-air.

Jason's gaze moved slowly from her face down to her legs under the skirt, and he sneered, "It seems Mr. Mille's hot milk really worked wonders, curing Ms. Black's leg injury."

###chapter 454: Everyone Wants Her Dead

Elodie was stunned.

She had been so angry just now that she forgot to pretend to be disabled, which were now standing firmly on the ground, away from the wheelchair.

Elodie lifted her head, delivering another slap to Jason's other cheek, barked, "Jason, I'm warning you, if you dare tell Richard about this, you're doomed!"

Jason smiled, "Of course."

His calm demeanor left Elodie unsure of how to respond.

Jason had been with the Black Family for a long time.

As far as Elodie could remember, he had been with the Black Family even longer than Richard, having spent more time in their service.

Jason had always been a very steady and reserved person, respectful to everyone in the Black Family.

This was the first time she had seen another side of Jason, who appeared a bit mad and somewhat deranged.

Staring at Jason for too long made Elodie feel a bit scared.

Averting her gaze, she ordered, "You can leave now."

Lowering her hand, Jason smiled, "Ms. Black, Richard went after Nina. I guess their family of three will soon be reunited."

The phrase "family of three" stabbed Elodie deeply.

She clenched her fingers with an angry laugh, snarling through gritted teeth, "After tonight, there will be no more Nina in this world. Richard can go if he wants; consider it he sending Nina off for the last time."

After saying that, she laughed.

Jason lowered his eyes, thenÂ silently left.

Walking out of the villa area,Â Nina saw the car parked by the roadside.

It was the same car that Zaire had arranged to bring her here.

When Nina was waiting for Richard inside, the car had been waiting outside for her.

The driver was smart and had parked the car in a conspicuous spot so that Nina could see it as soon as she came out.

But the windows were tightly closed, with no driver in sight.

Nina walked closer and found the driver sitting inside, head down, seemingly playing with his phone.

As Nina opened the car door to get in, a knife was pressed against her throat.

In the back seat sat a masked man, with a bound and gagged man slumped beside him, the driver from before.

Nina's heart skipped a beat, lifting her gaze to the front with the realization that the driver had been replaced.

In the passenger seat, there was another masked man dressed similarly.

After the car doors were locked, the car slowly started.

The man holding the knife to Nina's neck spat viciously, "Nina, blame yourself for not knowing your place. Coming here to ruin Ms. Black's wedding, even if Ms. Black could tolerate you, we, the Black Family's subordinates, must avenge her!"

With that, the man applied more pressure with the knife, seemingly wanting to end Nina's life in one stroke.

"Wait!" It was the man in the passenger seat who spoke.

He exchanged a glance with the driver,Â saying to the man with the knife, "Kade Campbell, did Ms. Black send you?"

"No! I came on my own!" Kade replied righteously.

The two men in the front exchanged another glance, then the man in the passenger seat said, "This matter isn't that serious."

"How is it not serious? This woman came to ruin the wedding. You know how much Mr. Black values tomorrow's wedding. This woman dared to fake a pregnancy today; who knows if she won't cause a scene at the wedding tomorrow."

"Mr. Black has had a successful career, but his children have had their own misfortunes. Now that Ms. Black's legs are crippled, it's fortunate that Richard agreed to marry Ms. Black and take care of her for life."

"If this wedding doesn't happen, both Ms. Black and Mr. Black won't survive. As a subordinate of the Black Family, this is the least I can do for them." Kade spoke calmly, but Nina broke out in a cold sweat.

She realized that this man was here to kill her today seriously.

After Kade finished speaking, he asked the two men in the front, "I assume you came with the same intention. This is a great opportunity to earn merit."

"You don't need to do anything, and when Mr. Black asks, I won't hesitate to give you credit."

Saying that, Kade's eyes gleamed with excitement.

It was as if Nina's life was insignificant to him.

What mattered was the merit he could earn in the Black Family.

Nina couldn't understand this behavior, but with the knife pressed tightly against her neck, she didn't dare to move and could only listen.

From her judgment, the two men in the front didn't seem to be on the same side as Kade.

But they seemed to know each other.

As Nina was thinking, the driver adjusted the rearview mirror for meeting Nina's eyes.

In that brief moment, Nina sensed the hostility in his eyes.

With that, she was almost certain that the two men in the front were enemies who want her dead.

As soon as she got here, several groups of people wanted her dead.

Nina just didn't know if any of these people were sent by Richard.

Thinking of this, Nina's heart ached uncontrollably.

The man in the front handed over a handkerchief, and the man in the back took it to cover Nina's mouth and nose without hesitation.

A pungent smell rushed into Nina's nose, making she felt her head buzz and started to feel dizzy, her body going limp.

In her last moments of consciousness, she vaguely heard the man in the front say.

"Mr. Mille's orders are not to cause any deaths."

So, Richard had indeed sent someone.

Nina didn't have time to feel sad before she blacked out completely.

She didn't know how much time had passed.

Cold water splashed on Nina's face, pulling her consciousness back from the darkness.

She opened her eyes suddenly, finding herself still in the car.

The car door was open, and one man was controlling her while the other two stood outside.

It was pitch dark around them; they had driven the car to a large, overgrown field.

Nina's lips trembled as she asked, "What exactly do you want to do?"

The three men turned to look at Nina but said nothing.

The man standing by the car door took out a box of pills from his pocket then opened it in front of Nina.

After opening the pills, he walked over to Nina, saying, "Take these two pills, then we'll let you go."

Nina's pupils contracted, "What are these pills?"

"They won't take your life. Nina, I advise you to comply. Otherwise, it won't end well for you." The man threatened.

Nina struggled, her arms hurting from being restrained, "I won't take them."

"Fuck!" Kade cursed, grabbing Nina's hair and forcing her to look up.

He shouted to the other two, "What are you waiting for? Force her to take the pills!"

###chapter 455: What About Him?

Then a man came over to pry Nina's mouth open.

But Nina clenched her teeth tightly, refusing to open her mouth no matter how hard the man tried.

"Fuck!" Kade cursed again, yanking Nina's hair back forcefully.

Nina felt a sharp pain in her scalp, as if it were being torn off.

Kade was ruthless, while the other two men looked hesitant.

Seeing their reluctance, Kade grabbed the pills, "You hold her hair, don't let go! I'll feed her the pills!"

After saying, he immediately switching roles with them.

As soon as Nina's scalp was released, she suddenly bit down hard on Kade's hand.

Kade screamed in pain slapping Nina across the face.

Nina, who was already sitting by the car door, was slapped out of the car and landed heavily in a patch of tall weeds.

She felt dizzy and disoriented. Just as she got up from the ground, Kade grabbed her hair again.

He raised his bloody hand for punching and kicking Nina.

It wasn't until the other two men intervened that Kade reluctantly stopped.

At this point, Nina was lying on the ground, covered in bruises.

"Bitch!" Kade spat on Nina, holding the white pills to force them into her mouth.

Nina was in so much pain that she couldn't move, but she still clenched her teeth tightly.

Seeing this, Kade angrily kicked her a couple more times.

Nina curled up on the ground, protecting her belly with her hands. She didn't make a sound, even as Kade's hard shoes kicked her shoulders and back.

"Kade, stop! If you keep going, you'll kill her. When Mr. Mille asks, none of us will be able to explain." One of the men was anxiously reassuring.

Kade snorted and turned Nina over to face the sky, then grabbed Nina's jaw, trying to force her to open her mouth.

After a tense standoff, suddenly, a crisp sound was heard, showing that Nina's mouth finally opened.

Kade complacently shoved the pills into her mouth, grabbed some water, pouring it into her mouth, not giving her a chance to spit it out. He forced the pills down her throat.

Nina struggled, but it was futile.

After a while, the men finally let her go.

She immediately turned over trying to induce vomiting, hoping to expel the pills she had just swallowed.

She did vomit some, but not all of it. The pills had already dissolved and entered her stomach.

The sound of the car engine faded away as the men drove off, leaving Nina in the wilderness.

Nina got up from the weeds and stumbled forward.

She didn't know how long she had been running when she finally saw the headlights of a car.

She waved her hand twice before collapsing in the middle of the road.

The car screeched to a halt in front of her.

Richard quickly got out of the car. When he saw Nina's condition, he felt heartbroken.

"Nina!" Richard placed her in the car, holding her tightly but carefully.

She was covered in injuries, her hair was a mess, and large clumps fell out at a touch. Her jaw was swollen, even her mouth wouldn't close.

Richard immediately saw that Nina's jaw was broken and she had just endured inhumane torture.

Nina suddenly moved letting out a cry of pain.

Richard immediately became anxious, "Nina? It's me."

Nina slowly opened her eyes, feeling as if her body had been cut open, the pain growing stronger.

"It hurts." Large beads of sweat formed on her forehead.

In just a few seconds, the pain intensified.

Richard reached out to touch her face, but Nina grabbed his hand.

Nina trembled violently in Rachard's arms with her nails digging into the back of his hand.

"It hurts so much."

A bad thought flashed through Richard's mind. He looked down at Nina's pantsÂ which was soaked with blood.

"The baby!" Richard was anxious.

Nina was rushed into the operating room for emergency treatment.

Richard waited outside all night.

During that time, medical staff came in and out several times.

They had him sign the surgery consent form, informing him that the baby couldn't be saved and Nina needed to reveive a D&C procedure immediately.

Richard's heart sank, but he eventually signed his name.

He handed the pen to the nurse and grabbed her wrist, "Please save her! I want her to live!"

The nurse nodded,Â reassuring him, "Don't worry, she should be fine."

Richard breathed a sigh of relief, watching the nurse go back in and the operating room door close. He took a few steps back, leaning against the wall.

The red light above the operating room door was glaring, like Nina's blood, piercing Richard's eyes.

That night, Nina was on the brink of death.

After the surgery, she fell into a coma.

When Nina woke up, the stark white ceiling hurt her eyes, and the smell of disinfectant in the hospital stung her nose.

She slowly placed her hand on her belly, tears uncontrollably rolling down her cheeks.

Suddenly, a warm hand gently wiped away her tears.

Nina opened her eyes. Despite her blurred vision from the tears, she could still recognize who it was.

She quickly raised her hand, pushed the person away, trying to sit up.

But Nina was too weak. She felt dizzy then fell back onto the pillow.

"Nina." A familiar voice sounded in her ear.

Nina's ears buzzed. She opened her eyes again, seeing that the person watching over her was Zaire.

Zaire bent slightly, not knowing where to place his hands. His eyes were bloodshot with his worried face.

"Nina. You're finally awake. You scared me to death," Zaire asked worriedly, "do you feel any discomfort? I'll call the doctor."

Nina grabbed his hand to ask, holding back her heartache, "Where is he?"

Zaire's first reaction was to avoid her gaze, then he said in a very indifferent tone, "Nina, this is my fault."

Nina suddenly let go of his hand.

Seeing her calm expression, Zaire suddenly felt a lump in his throat, unable to face Nina.

After all, he was the one who persuaded Nina to come, and now it had ended like this.

"I'll go get the doctor." Zaire felt that the smell of disinfectant in the ward was stronger than anywhere else.

It was so thick, it was suffocating!

Leaving the ward, Zaire quickly went to the doctor's office.

When he returned with a group of medical staff, Nina was no longer in the hospital bed.

###chapter 456: No More Debts

Today is the wedding day of Elodie from the Black Family held at the luxurious European-style villa of the Black Family.

Early in the morning, many people had already arrived.

Richard stood by the window on the second floor, lifting a corner of the curtain with his left hand, taking in the bustling scene below.

Behind him stood a row of maids, and on the sofa was the meticulously ironed groom's suit.

After a few minutes, a maid reminded him, "Mr. Mille, the wedding is about to start. You should get dressed."

Richard's hand moved slightly, letting the curtain fall back down. He turned to the dressing room.

Today, the maids of the Black Family were dressed even more plainly than usual. Each of them wore drab colors, as per Elodie's orders. Today was Elodie's day, she wouldn't allow any woman to outshine her. She had ordered all the maids not to wear bright colors, not to wear any jewelry, and not to wear makeup. She even gave each of them a black mask.

As soon as Richard entered the dressing room, several maids followed, intending to help him change clothes.

But as soon as they reached out, Richard's cold gaze stopped them.

"All of you, go out. I can do it myself." Richard's voice was flat, with no hint of the joy one would expect from a groom on his wedding day.

His face seemed covered in frost, making it clear to anyone that c

The maids shrank back, left the room with their heads down.

Only one person remained standing in the corner, unmoving.

Richard turned his displeased gaze towards her, but when he met her eyes, he was momentarily stunned.

Then, his expression hardened. He quickly walked to the door of the dressing room, shut it, then approached the maid, lifting her mask.

"Nina." Richard seemed a bit agitated. He carefully examined Nina's pale face, gripping her shoulders tightly before pulling her into his arms. "Nina, I'm sorry."

The words Richard wanted to say stuck in his throat.

Thinking about what had happened the night before, Richard felt a deep sense of guilt towards Nina.

He had wanted to protect her and their child, but he was late.

No matter the reason, the fact is that he was responsible for the loss of their child.

Richard could only hold Nina tightly, whispering in her ear, "After today, everything will be fine. Nina, we will have another child."

The sound of a blade piercing flesh echoed.

Richard's tall frame stiffened. He slowly released his hold on her, then Nina immediately stepped back.

The distance between them widened.

Richard saw the knife embedded in his body, the entire blade buried, leaving only a small part of the handle visible. Blood was seeping from the wound, quickly soaking his white shirt.

But Richard didn't feel much pain. From the moment Nina appeared, he only felt a heart-wrenching pain.

Compared to the pain in Richard's heart, the stab wound on his body was nothing.

Even if Nina stabbed him multiple times, he wouldn't mind.

Seeing the blood, Nina's face turned even paler.

Richard stepped forward, ignoring his injuries. Grabbing Nina's hand, he made her hold the knife, then pulled it out forcefully.

Blood splattered on Nina's face. She blinked, her hand holding the knife handle swelling with pain, making her entire arm ache.

After pulling out the knife, Richard gritted his teeth and took a few breaths, then gripped her hand again, aiming the knife at his heart and pushing down.

Realizing what he intended to do, Nina's eyes widened in horror, and she tried to pull the knife towards herself.

But the knife still pierced Richard's skin.

The stab wasn't deep, but it was shocking.

Richard didn't stop there. He continued to grip her hand, trying to push the knife deeper into his flesh.

Nina shook her head, tears streaming down her face.

Seeing her tears, Richard paused slightly, breathing heavily, his eyes fixed on her. "As long as it makes you feel better, you can stab me as many times as you want. Go ahead, stab me."

With that, he pushed the knife further into his flesh.

The slow, deliberate stabbing was more painful and torturous than a quick thrust.

Large beads of sweat quickly formed on Richard's forehead.

But he didn't stop, and as the blade slowly sank into his chest, Nina suddenly let out a scream.

Her scream snapped Richard out of his trance. Nina finally pulled her hand from his grasp and stepped back quickly until her back hit the cabinet door.

Nina's face was wet with tears. "Richard, we're even now."

With that, she ran out the door.

"Nina." Richard wanted to chase after her, but after taking a few steps, the sharp pain from his wound stopped him. He had to halt, his tall frame swaying before he steadied himself.

Elodie was getting her makeup done when she suddenly heard the sound of an ambulance.

Startled, she asked, "Why is there an ambulance?"

The maids looked flustered and stammered.

Elodie lost her temper. "Tell me! Who's hurt?"

"It's Mr. Mille."

"Richard? What happened to him?" Elodie asked anxiously.

"I don't know the details. It seems Mr. Mille was stabbed."

"Stabbed? By whom?" Elodie pursued.

The maid shook her head.

Elodie said, "Quick! Take me to see him!"

As the maid pushed her to the door, it opened from the outside. Michael stood there with a few others, coldly saying, "I'm sorry, Ms. Black, but you can't go out now."

Elodie frowned. "Michael? How dare you stop me?"

"I wouldn't dare. These are Richard's orders. I'm just following them."

Elodie gritted her teeth. "I must go out today."

She rolled her wheelchair forward, almost running over Michael's foot, but she didn't stop. Michael stood there like a stone, unmoving. Eventually, the wheelchair stopped.

Elodie had no choice but to stay at the door, glaring up at Michael. "Move!"

Michael remained like a rock. "You can't leave here."

"I need to see Richard!" Elodie insisted.

"You can't leave here!" Michael repeated.

Elodie was so angry she almost spat blood.

Knowing Michael wouldn't budge, she retreated back into the room with anger.

She called Bruno, but it was Wade who answered.

.

"Wade." Elodie had no feelings for Wade, but she decided to act all pitiful. "Michael has locked me in the room. He won't let me out. I think he's rebelling. Come save me!"

There was a long silence before Wade's voice came through. "I told him to lock you in the room."

###chapter 457: A Leap Down

"What?" Elodie was stunned for a moment before she realized, "Wade."

Wade had been wandering outside for a few years, and when he was brought back, his mental state was not normal. But at this moment, Wade's voice sounded like that of a normal person.

Before Elodie could ask, she heard a few coughs from the other end of the phone.

She recognized it as Bruno's voice, asking, "What's wrong with Dad?"

"Oh." Wade's voice was very flat, devoid of any emotion, "Mr. Black is sick. I'm about to take him to the hospital."

"Dad is sick?" Elodie was skeptical, "I saw him this morning; he was fine. How did Dad suddenly get sick? What's wrong?"

"Well, that needs to be checked by a doctor to know." Wade answered.

"Wade." The call was disconnected while Elodie was talking.

When Elodie called back, no one answered.

Downstairs, the guests were filling the hall, and everything seemed to be proceeding in an orderly manner.

It seemed that no one noticed the groom being taken away by an ambulance.

No one knew that the bride was locked in a room on the second floor.

But on the big screen, wedding photos of her and Richard were still being played, and the guests were drinking and chatting. This scene appeared so bizarre to Elodie.

Suddenly, she remembered something and then called Esme.

Strangely enough, it was her wedding day, but she hadn't seen Esme all day.

Initially, Elodie thought Esme might be busy entertaining guests, but at this moment, Elodie felt something was wrong.

The phone rang a few times before it was answered.

"Mom, where are you? Do you know Dad is sick? An ambulance just came. Did you hear it? Richard was stabbed. Michael locked me in a room." Elodie said a lot, only to realize there was no sound from the other end. "Mom? Why aren't you saying anything?"

"Elodie. Esme is with me. What do you want to say?" Wade replied.

"Wade?" For some reason, a sense of fear arose in Elodie's heart, "Why do you have my mom's phone? Where is she?"

"Esme is taking care of Mr. Black." Wade answered.

"Give the phone to my mom. I want to talk to her." Elodie said hastily.

"OK." Wade didn't refuse her, seemingly handing the phone to Esme.

"Elodie." Esme's voice came through, urgent and distressed.

"Mom." Elodei asked.

"Elodie, run!" Esme shouted.

The call was disconnected again.

When Elodie called back, she couldn't get through.

Esme's words kept echoing in her ears.

Esme told her to run? What did that mean?

Today was her wedding day. She was the bride. Where was she supposed to run to?

Suddenly, the wedding march from downstairs floated in through the window.

Elodie exchanged a horrified look with the maid locked in the room with her.

According to the schedule, the wedding march was played when the bride made her entrance. But the bride was still in the room, so why was the march being played downstairs?

"Hurry! Push me over to take a look!"

The maid, filled with curiosity, didn't dare to delay, quickly pushing the wheelchair to the window.

The two of them leaned out to look.

The maid's face instantly turned as pale as paper.

Elodie, too, was shocked, her brows furrowing tightly.

In the garden below, two maids were carrying two paper effigies onto the stage.

One of the effigies was made using a photo from Elodie's wedding dress photoshoot.

Looking around, the white silk had all turned into black fabric.

"What is going on?" Elodie's voice trembled.

Elodie couldn't care about anything else. She stood up from the wheelchair, grabbed the window, and shouted, "Who's playing tricks? I'm Elodie, I'm here! Why are you decorating my wedding like this?"

Maybe the music downstairs was too loud, but Elodie's voice didn't catch anyone's attention. Her voice was soon drowned out by the music.

Elodie turned to glare fiercely at the maid.

The maid shrank back under Elodie's glare, "Ms. Black, are you a human or a ghost?"

"What do you think?" Elodie had put on beautiful makeup, but her expression was so ferocious at the moment that the maid really thought she looked like a vengeful ghost.

The maid became even more frightened and backed away, not daring to approach Elodie.

"Come here!" Elodie shouted. Seeing the maid continuously retreating, Elodie angrily went forward to grab her.

The maid screamed in terror, turned, runnnig out of the room.

Strangely, Michael didn't stop the maid.

But when Elodie rushed out, Michael blocked her.

It was clear that Michael was only targeting Elodie.

The wedding downstairs continued.

As soon as the maid got downstairs, she was knocked out from behind by Michael's men and taken to a room to rest.

Elodie stood by the window, half of her body leaning out. She watched helplessly as her bizarre wedding with Richard took place in front of everyone.

It seemed that in everyone's eyes, she was already dead.

"No, that's not it! I'm still alive I'm right here! You idiots, are you all deaf? Look up!"

Elodie screamed in near despair, but it was useless. It was as if she was truly isolated from the world. Except for Michael at the door, no one could hear her.

Even though she was wearing a white wedding dress, climbed onto the windowsill, screaming hysterically, she was still ignored.

"Everyone's gone crazy!" Elodie grabbed her hair toring at her dress, feeling like her world was collapsing.

Finally, she jumped from the upstairs.

A white figure drew a beautiful arc in the air.

Blood splattered on the spot.

Isabella had come with Quentin.

Before leaving, Quentin had someone meticulously dress her up.

Everything she wore was in Lova's style.

Even Isabella's hair had been extended overnight.

Looking at her face, completely made up to resemble Lova, Isabella could hardly recognize herself.

Isabella really saw Lova's shadow in herself.

At the same time, Isabella was secretly alarmed. If she hadn't stayed clear-headed, if Quentin's hypnosis had succeeded, she would have become a completely fabricated Lova.

Isabella didn't expect Quentin to bring her to Elodie's wedding.

During this time, Isabella had been under house arrest, but she had seen the news about Richard and Elodie's wedding on TV.

Isabella was full of doubts. 'How did things turn out like this?'

Isabella wanted to ask Richard in person, but she didn't expect to see Elodie, dressed in a wedding gown, jump from upstairs as soon as she arrived.

Strangely, the guests clearly saw it but pretended not to.

Elodie's white wedding dress was quickly stained red with blood.

At this moment, Michael came out with his men.

###chapter 458: Wanting to Make Love So Badly

Isabella was led over by Quentin, just in time to hear Michael instruct his subordinates, "Call an ambulance."

Michael's tone was very calm, without a trace of tension or panic. He stood over Elodie, looking down at her as if he were observing a dying insect, his gaze devoid of any warmth.

Elodie wasn't dead yet; she had landed face-first, her face a bloody mess, lying on the ground convulsing uncontrollably.

Her hand clawed at the ground, as if trying to grasp something, but only left thin trails of blood.

"How did this happen?" Quentin spoke, and Michael finally turned around.

Michael's gaze swept over Quentin and Isabella's faces, finally landing on their tightly clasped hands. Raising an eyebrow, Michael said, "Isabella, long time no see."

Isabella looked at Quentin in confusion, seemingly unaware that Michael was speaking to her.

Quentin voiced, "Michael, this is Lova from the Black Family."

"Really?" Michael laughed, "Your plan to have Isabella replace Lova is quite interesting."

"Michael, watch your words!" Quentin warned sharply.

Michael was unfazed by Quentin's warning and gave a faint smile.

Isabella noticed his hand move to his waist, and with a swift motion, he drew a short knife. The sharp blade was aimed directly at Quentin.

Quentin was startled.

Before Quentin could react, Isabella had already stepped in front of him.

The blade stopped abruptly just one inch from Isabella's neck. Quentin pulled Isabella back, gripping her shoulders with both hands, "Are you crazy?"

The knife was in Michael's hand, but her life was her own.

Michael's move had been so fast and fierce that no one could say for sure whether he would have stopped.

Even if Michael intended to stop, no one could guarantee he would judge the distance correctly.

If Michael had slipped, Isabella would be dead.

But just now, Isabella had unhesitatingly stood in front of Quentin, trying to use her own life to block Michael's knife for him!

Quentin looked at Isabella, deeply shaken.

During this time, Quentin had indeed been brainwashing Isabella, not only turning her into the real Lova but also altering some of her memories.

In the memories Quentin had changed, Lova had a crush on him since childhood.

He just hadn't expected his hypnosis to be so successful that in such a life-and-death moment, Isabella would unhesitatingly come to his rescue!

Deeply moved, Quentin suddenly reached out to hug Isabella tightly.

Michael raised an eyebrow, "Quentin, Lova is your sister. Hugging her like this in front of so many people seems inappropriate, doesn't it?"

Quentin seemed like he didn't hear anything, holding Isabella so tightly as if he wanted to make her a part of him.

Isabella, helplessly held by him, looked up and met a gaze from the second-floor balcony.

She was startled, knowing it was Seb.

Bradley had mentioned that Seb had also come to Silvercrest.

But seeing Seb at the Black Family still surprised Isabella a bit.

The Black Family was so dangerous, with everyone like a ticking time bomb. How did Seb get in? Why was he on the second floor? Was anyone protecting him?

"Lova." Quentin had already let her go, noticing her gaze towards the second floor.

Quentin turned around, following her line of sight, but saw nothing.

"What's wrong?" Quentin took Isabella's hand again.

Isabella gently shook her head, docile as a lamb.

The ambulance arrived quickly and took Elodie away.

Isabella looked at this farcical wedding, feeling it was absurd.

"I need to use the restroom." Tired of dealing with the socialites, Isabella found an excuse to slip away.

Quentin had been chatting with some male guests, but seeing this, he stepped out of the crowd and came to her side.

"What's wrong?" Quentin asked.

"I need to use the restroom." Isabella put down her wine glass.

Quentin also put down his glass, "I'll go with you."

Isabella knew he was suspicious, and if she didn't let him accompany her, he would definitely be suspicious.

Refusing was useless, so she simply didn't refuse and pretended to comply, "Okay."

At the restroom, Quentin waited outside while Isabella went in alone.

Away from Quentin's control, Isabella let out a long sigh of relief.

The restroom was very quiet. She checked each stall one by one, and when she reached the last stall, just as she reached out to push the door open, a hand suddenly extended from inside, grabbing her arm and pulling her in.

Before Isabella could scream, her lips were covered by a pair of warm lips.

Then came a frenzied kiss.

Scared out of her mind, Isabella struggled desperately, but her hands and feet were easily restrained by the other person.

She was pinned against the stall door, all her breaths and sounds swallowed by the other person.

Isabella's eyes widened, and after the initial shock, she finally saw who was kissing her.

"Seb." Isabella murmured.

She stopped struggling and instead leaned in to respond to his kiss.

But at that moment, Seb let her go.

Seb gripped her chin with one hand, breathing heavily as he stared at her, "You want to have sex that badly? Quentin couldn't satisfy your desires?"

Isabella's eyes reddened, wrapping her arms around Seb's neck, tears streaming down her face.

Seb looked at her, his eyes also reddening. One hand supported her lower back while the other gently caressed her thin back. Seb's long fingers traced her shoulder blades, his brow furrowing slightly, "You've lost weight."

"So have you," Isabella's voice trembled.

They hugged each other tightly.

Isabella cherished this embrace deeply, but she knew that even cherished moments had their time limits.

After a while, she pulled away from Seb's embrace, "That's enough."

Seb's hand was still on her waist, "What's enough?"

"I need to go out," Isabella wiped away her tears, her voice as low as possible, "Quentin is still outside."

As she spoke, she reached out to open the door.

Just as her fingers touched the door handle, Seb pulled her back.

"Are you afraid of him? Aren't you afraid of making me unhappy?" Seb cornered Isabella.

Isabella shook her head, "I know you don't have the power to go against the Black Family right now."

"Who says I can't do it?" Seb interrupted her softly, a gentle smile playing at the corners of his eyes, "Bella, you have too little faith in me."

Isabella blinked, not quite understanding his words, "But."

Seb tightened his grip on her hand, "Bella, from now on, hold onto my hand tightly. No matter what happens, don't let go."

Isabella bit her lip.

She wanted to hold onto his hand and never let go, but given the current situation, was that even possible?

"Shh." His thumb brushed over her fingers.

Footsteps sounded outside, the clacking of high heels on the floor.

It seemed a female guest had come into the restroom.

Seb unhurriedly opened the nearby window, then placed his hands on Isabella's waist and gently lifted her up. Isabella jumped out of the window.

Below was soft grass. Isabella had just steadied herself when Seb followed her out.

He thoughtfully closed the window, took Isabella's hand, and led her towards the backyard.

Meanwhile.

Quentin, waiting in front, checked his watch. When a female guest came out, Quentin stepped forward to ask, "Excuse me, is there anyone else inside?"

"I didn't notice," the guest shook her head.

Seeing his apparent urgency, the guest went back in to check for him.

When she came out again, she told Quentin, "There's no one inside."

Quentin narrowed his eyes. He knew every corner of the Black Family estate like the back of his hand and naturally guessed where Isabella had gone.

He immediately headed towards the backyard.

In a dimly lit storage room in the Black Family's backyard.

Isabella was pressed against a shelf by Seb, her heart pounding. She was terrified of being discovered but couldn't resist Seb's passion, responding to him softly.

Suddenly, she heard footsteps approaching their direction.

Then, someone walked to the door of the storage room pushing it open.

Isabella glanced over, finding it was Quentin.

She and Seb were hiding inside. The room was so dark that Quentin couldn't see them immediately, but Isabella's heart was still racing.

Her fingers clutched Seb's shirt tightly. She couldn't warn him verbally, so she could only grit her teeth.

Seb sensed her tension, paused for a couple of seconds, and then resumed kissing her.

Isabella hadn't expected him to be so bold. Caught off guard, she let out a muffled groan.

That sound made Quentin, standing at the door, pause and step inside.

His hand groped along the wall, then Isabella realized he was trying to turn on the light.

The room was cluttered with items, but it wasn't large. In the dark, she and Seb could still hide.

Once the light was on, they would have nowhere to hide.

She couldn't even imagine what would happen to Seb if they were discovered.

Isabella was scared to death, but Seb seemed oblivious, continuing to kiss her intently.

Quentin's hand found the switch on the wall. Just as he was about to press it, footsteps sounded outside again.

This time, it seemed more than one person was coming.

Quentin abandoned the idea of turning on the light and quickly walked to the door to take a look.

For some reason, he didn't leave but instead turned back, quickly moving to the back of the shelf.

As he rounded the shelf, he saw Isabella and Seb hiding behind it.

###chapter 459 Stubbornness

Behind the storage room, there was a window, outside of which some sycamore trees were planted. The dense branches and leaves scattered the streetlight's glow. At this moment, the light and shadows fell on Isabella and Seb, creating a beautiful, mottled scene that framed their silhouettes.

So when Quentin came around, he saw Isabella and Seb embracing each other.

Quentin froze, his hands at his sides clenching tightly.

Just then, footsteps from outside the door began to come in one after another.

Someone let out a muffled grunt, and someone went to turn on the wall light.

That person pressed the switch several times, but the overhead light didn't respond at all.

It turned out to be a broken light.

Isabella let out a sigh of relief. Under Quentin's gaze, she and Seb had been kissing for several minutes.

Quentin's gaze felt like a knife cutting through her. She had to endure Seb's passion while worrying that Quentin might rush over, making her feel like a tightly strung bow, extremely uncomfortable.

Seb felt the sweat on her back and finally couldn't bear to let her suffer any longer, slowly ending the kiss.

Isabella leaned against his chest, listening to their intense heartbeats, her breathing gradually calming down.

A dull sound came from the other end of the shelf, showing that something had been smashed to the ground.

Wriggling out of Seb's embrace, Isabella looked outside through the gaps in the shelves.

Bruno and Esme were tied up with ropes, sitting on a wooden bench nearby.

Wade had smoked two cigarettes outside the door, then walked in, his gaze sweeping over the two of them. "So, Mr. Black, have you thought it over?"

"Bastard!" As soon as the tape on Bruno's mouth was torn off, he started cursing, "I'm your biological father, how can you do this to me?"

Wade took a document from one of his men, walked over, and squatted in front of him. "Mr. Black, I'm still your son. Didn't you also have the heart to harm me? Don't think you can push everything onto Quentin and get away with it. Do you really think I'm stupid? If you hadn't tacitly approved back then, how could I have suffered so much outside for all these years? In the end, I had to pretend to be crazy just to survive."

"What nonsense are you spouting? When did I ever harm you?" Bruno asked.

Wade sneered, "Stop pretending, Mr. Black. I know you better than anyone. There's no need to put on an act in front of me."

"Wade, what you're doing is breaking my heart." Bruno's face was full of anguish.

If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have believed that his own son would turn against him!

When Wade tied Bruno up, he didn't show any mercy, not treating Bruno as his father at all.

Bruno had been thinking about Wade all these years. As soon as he found out Wade was still alive, he immediately sent people to search. Bruno had taken great risks, avoiding Quentin's surveillance, to rescue Wade.

"Heartbroken?" Wade suddenly became agitated, the smile disappearing from his face. He stared at Bruno with wide eyes. "Do you think I don't know? Back then, because I had sex with Lova, it provoked Quentin, and to please Esme, you tacitly allowed Quentin to torture me. You just didn't expect Quentin's power to grow so much that you were also doomed. That's when you remembered me, your biological son, then had me brought back. You don't need me as a son; you need a legitimate tool to take over the Black Family."

Isabella was shocked, instinctively looking at Quentin.

But Quentin stood there quietly, listening to everything calmly.

When Wade mentioned having sex with Lova, Quentin didn't seem to react.

Or rather, Quentin probably already knew about it, so he didn't react.

It was the first time Isabella had heard about it, leaving her bewildered.

No matter what, Lova was Wade's half-sister, Isabella couldn't believe Wade had done such a terrible thing to Lova!

Bruno gritted his teeth, wishing he could slap Wade across the face.

But Bruno's hands and feet were tightly bound, and his anger was in vain.

Wade sneered, slapping the document in his hand onto Bruno's face. "You're going to hand over the Black Family to me sooner or later, so why not do it now? As long as you still acknowledge me as your son, don't worry, I won't let you die."

"Bastard, if I had known you would turn out like this, I wouldn't have brought you back!" Bruno roared.

"Too late." Wade placed the document on the ground and took out a knife, waving its sharp blade. "Mr. Black, I'll give you ten seconds."

"Ten, nine, eight." Wade slowly counted down.

When Wade finished, Bruno still didn't relent.

After all, Bruno experienced a lot so he wouldn't be easily forced into a corner by Wade's words.

"Wade, if I die because of you today, it will be my karma." At the brink of life and death, Bruno became calm. "If you want to kill me, go ahead. I have nothing more to say. As for the Black Family, if you have the ability, take it yourself."

Wade chuckled, "I knew you were stubborn. But even the most stubborn people have weaknesses."

As he spoke, Wade's gaze slowly shifted to Esme's face.

Esme seemed to understand something when she met Wade's eyes.

Wade walked towards Esme.

Bruno frowned, "Bastard, what are you going to do? She's your stepmother!"

"Stepmother? I even had sex with my own sister. Do you think I wouldn't dare to harm Esme?" Wade's smile turned wicked.

Wade lifted Esme's chin, leering at her. "I've never tasted a stepmother before."

"Bastard, you dare!" Bruno shouted.

"Considering you gave birth to someone as delicate as Lova, you as her mother shouldn't be any worse, right?"

"Bastard!" Bruno coughed violently, his face turning red.

But all Bruno could do now was roar.

Ignoring Bruno's roars, Wade pushed Esme to the ground and straddled her.

There was a ripping sound of fabric tearing, followed by Esme's scream.

"Mom." Isabella wanted to rush out but was held back by a hand.

Isabella looked up at Seb's eyes.

Seb shook his head at Isabella, signaling her not to interfere.

Outside, another scream echoed.

Accompanied by Bruno's incessant cursing, the entire storage room was filled with noise.

Isabella turned her head to see Esme's clothes torn to shreds.

###chapter 460: Died of Anger

Esme screamed, but her cries seemed to only excite Wade more, making him do even worse things.

Wade's sharp laughter mixed with Esme's voice.

Bruno stood nearby, his eyes filled with tears of blood, cursing Wade with the filthiest words he could muster.

The narrow little storage room was filled with the most unbearable scenes in the world.

And in the front yard of the Black Family, the faint sound of a melodious piano seemed to mock this scene.

Another sound of fabric tearing was heard.

The last bit of cloth on Esme was torn off by Wade, leaving her in just her underwear.

Esme's body came into Wade's view. He grinned wickedly, his face showing a lecherous expression, his eyes shamelessly scanning Esme's body. "I know this old woman had a great figure, otherwise, why would you be so obsessed with her? Back then, she had already had a child with another man, but you still had her husband killed to bring her back. Esme's figure is no worse than those young girls."

"Bastard! Shut up!" Bruno shouted.

Wade looked at him with a smirk, "Look at you, sweating all over. It's just her husband's life, isn't it? You've killed so many people already.

Bruno was furious.

Wade didn't care about Bruno's life or death. He turned to Esme and said, "All these years, hasn't your dead husband ever come into your dreams? Didn't he tell you that the one who ruined his family is Bruno who sleeps beside you every night?"

Esme shivered, seeming to understand something.

"Maybe your dead husband knew you had become the wife of his enemy. Your dead husband knew you were unreliable, right? Women, once they sleep with someone, they follow them." Quentin spread his legs, standing in front of Esme, then began to unbuckle his belt, his face still wearing a lewd smile. "Today, after I have sex with you, you'll be mine. Don't worry, I'm young, and my ability in bed is definitely better than Bruno's! I guarantee you'll enjoy it!"

As he finished speaking, Wade had already pulled down his belt and thrown it aside.

He grabbed Esme's legs, forcefully spreading them apart.

Esme had been struggling, but with her hands tied behind her back, she couldn't muster any strength.

She closed her eyes in despair as her legs were spread open by Wade.

When Bruno saw this, he was so furious that he collapsed and started convulsing. The commotion was enough to make Wade turn to look.

But Wade just glanced, then looked away. He really didn't care at all about Bruno's well-being.

Even though his biological father had just died in front of him.

Wade didn't care.

Isabella, hiding behind the shelves, had tried several times to rush out but was tightly held back by Seb.

At this moment, she couldn't hold back any longer. She forcefully broke free from Seb's grip and rushed out.

"Stop!" Isabella shouted.

As soon as she ran out, an arrow shot straight from the door.

Isabella didn't have time to react before a hand yanked her to the side.

She narrowly avoided the arrow, but Seb wasn't so lucky. When he reached out to pull Isabella, the arrow grazed his arm, leaving a shocking wound before embedding itself in the wall.

"Seb." Isabella exclaimed.

Seb grabbed her hand, gripping it tightly. "Bella, I told you, no matter what, don't let go of my hand. Did you forget so quickly?"

Isabella was shaken. "But my mom."

"She'll be fine." Seb nodded towards the room behind Isabella.

Isabella turned to see several men in black had suddenly appeared in the room, and the man walking in from outside was Richard.

Richard was also injured, his face pale, and blood was seeping through his shirt at the chest.

Richard looked terrible, but as he walked in and stood there, he was still solid as a rock, not budging an inch.

Seeing Richard, Wade frowned in displeasure. "Richard? Shouldn't you be in the hospital right now? Why are you back?"

Richard first glanced at Bruno, who was already dead on the ground, then his gaze shifted to Wade's face. He said expressionlessly, "Wade, Mr. Black is dead."

"He's dead, so what? He was old enough, he had enjoyed all the pleasures he could. Whether he died sooner or later, it doesn't matter." Wade's words left everyone speechless.

"Wade, Mr. Black was angered to death by you." Richard said calmly.

Wade was stunned, then smiled shamelessly. "So what?"

Saying this, Wade picked up the document on the ground, grabbed Bruno's finger, pressed it into the red ink, and then onto the document.

Wade threw the paper to Richard. "I got the document. Now the entire Black Family is mine. Richard, clear the place for me. Today, I want to have sex with Bruno's woman in front of him. Even if he's dead, he can't escape this!"

This was Wade's way of getting back at Bruno.

Wade wanted not just Bruno's life but for him to die without any dignity.

Wade seemed very excited. He didn't care that there were so many people watching and started undressing in public.

Wade kept undressing, and Isabella inadvertently noticed that his skin had a faint purple hue.

Just as Wade bent down to touch Esme, Isabella rushed over to blocked him.

"Wade, she's your stepmother. You can't do this!" Isabella yelled.

Wade's gaze fell on Isabella's face.

Wade's look made Isabella very uncomfortable, even making her feel nauseous.

Wade even tried to touch her face, but before he could, Seb grabbed Wade's hand.

Seeing it was Seb, Wade sneered disdainfully. He tried to shake off Seb's hand, but couldn't. Instead, a sharp pain shot through his wrist where Seb was holding him.

"Fuck!" Wade cursed, raising his other hand to hit Seb.

"Seb!" Isabella realized what he was about to do and quickly hugged Seb from the side.

Wade's slap landed on the back of Isabella's head.

Wade's slap was hard, making Isabella's head buzz and causing her to have a slight ringing in her ears.

"Bella!" Seb held her tightly, letting go of Wade, and took a few steps back with Isabella in his arms.

Once at a safe distance, Seb carefully removed her hands and checked her condition. "How do you feel?"

###chapter 461: Does It Still Hurt?

Isabella shook her head, "I'm fine."

Almost instantly, Seb punched Wade.

The punch landed squarely on Wade's nose. Isabella saw Wade clutch his nose and stagger back two steps, his face contorted in pain. Blood soon began to seep through his fingers.

Seb wasn't satisfied yet. His fists clenched tightly, he seemed ready to throw more punches.

Isabella, being timid, feared that Seb might lose control in his anger and accidentally kill Wade.

Although Wade was a scumbag who deserved to die a thousand times, she didn't want Seb to get his hands dirty.

Isabella stepped forward, gripping Seb's arm tightly with both hands. The tension in his muscles was palpable against her palms, indicating his intense anger.

Perhaps Isabella's touch brought Seb back to his senses. When Seb turned to look at her, the anger in his eyes gradually subsided.

He temporarily let Wade go, bent down, picking up Isabella, heading out.

Isabella clutched Seb's shirt, "My mom."

Seb softly consoled, "Don't worry, I'll have someone take her to the hospital."

"Okay." Isabella finally felt relieved.

Seeing Seb about to leave, Wade shouted, "What are you all standing around for? Didn't you see him hit me? Go beat him up!"

Several bodyguards in suits stood in the room, all looking very capable. Originally the Black Family's bodyguards, they were selected through rigorous tests, proving their high skill level. Stopping one Seb would be a piece of cake for them.

These men, originally loyal to Bruno, were later secretly recruited by Wade.Wade had promised these bodyguards that once he became the head of the Black Family, he would treat them well.

After all, Wade was the Black Family's first son and Bruno's only biological son. Bruno had brought him back this time to gradually hand over the inheritance to him.

For these bodyguards, serving Wade was just a matter of time. Since Wade had shown his sincerity first, they had no reason to refuse. When Wade officially took over, they could secure better prospects and treatment for themselves.

However, at this moment, despite Wade's orders, the bodyguards didn't move immediately. They first glanced at Bruno, who was already dead on the ground, then exchanged a few looks, and finally all turned to look at Richard standing at the door.

Wade sensed a hint of danger and angrily kicked the nearest bodyguard, cursing, "Are you all deaf? Why are you looking at Richard? I'm your boss!"

The bodyguards still didn't move, all looking at Richard.

It seemed that only if Richard gave the order would they act.

Richard saw everything. He first told Seb, "You take Isabella to the hospital. I'll come find you after I'm done here.."

"Okay." Seb nodded, then carried Isabella out.

Isabella looked back, seeing the storage room getting farther away. When Seb turned the corner, it disappeared completely.

In the car, Seb kept holding her. His hands were tightly wrapped around her waist, almost too tight.

Isabella looked up at him, "You're squeezing my ribs too hard."

Seb paused for a second, then loosened his grip, "Sorry."

His hand, through her clothes, gently rubbed her rib area, asking softly, "Does it still hurt?"

"It doesn't hurt anymore." Isabella grabbed his hand, "It tickles a bit."

Seb lowered his eyes, looking at Isabella closely.

Neither of them spoke, and for a moment, the atmosphere in the car was a bit delicate.

Listening to his breathing, even though Isabella had already had a child with him, being held by him like this still made her heart race, and her cheeks uncontrollably flushed.

"What's wrong? Why is your face so red?" Seb gently touched her cheek.

Isabella shook her head, mumbling, "I'm fine."

She grabbed Seb's hand, "I'm not seriously hurt. We don't need to go to the hospital."

"No way. Wade hit you pretty hard just now. We need to get you checked out at the hospital for my peace of mind." To reassure her, Seb added, "Besides, Esme will be at the hospital soon. Aren't you worried about her?"

Hearing this, Isabella didn't say anything more.

She looked at Seb, asking, "What exactly happened tonight? Wasn't it supposed to be Richard and Elodie's wedding? Why was Richard injured? Why did Wade tie up Bruno and Esme? And are we just leaving Richard there alone? Won't he be in danger?"

Seb looked at her anxious expression and listened to her voice, but instead, he laughed.

Isabella saw him laugh, feeling puzzled, "Why are you laughing?"

Seb turned her hand over and held it in his palm, "Bella, do you know? Until this moment, I wasn't sure if all this was real or just a dream."

Isabella looked at him, confused, "Of course, this isn't a dream."

She thought Seb was talking nonsense.

Seb smiled.

She would never know what kind of days Seb had lived through when Isabella was missing.

Every midnight, he would dream of her return.

In the dream, he would hold her tightly.

But dreams end.

When he woke up, he was alone in an empty, silent room, listening helplessly to his own breathing.

That feeling was truly despairing.

Coming to Silvercrest this time, both he and Richard took great risks.

Originally, they didn't expect things to go so smoothly. Unexpectedly, Wade, the idiot, helped them achieve success even faster.

Now that Bruno was dead, as long as Richard took control of the Black Family, everything would be perfect.

Seb's mind was filled with complex thoughts, but he didn't show any of it in front of Isabella.

He spoke with a soft smile, "You asked so many questions at once, where should I start?"

Isabella blinked and asked the most pressing question, "How is Sweetie?"

Perhaps their daughter was a soft spot for both of Isabella adn Seb. Seb's eyes softened, "She's doing well. She's been with the Jose family, and Margaret has taken good care of her. Sweetie can now say 'mommy' and 'daddy.' She's very obedient, and has grown more beautiful. You'll be delighted when you see her."

Isabella's eyes showed a hint of guilt, "I'm not a good mother."

She had been a child deprived of maternal love, and she never expected that due to various reasons, she would let her own child follow the same path.

"It's not your fault." Seb pulled her into his arms, "Besides, Sweetie is still young. What she missed, we'll make up for it twice over in the future."

"Okay." Isabella answered.

Isabella leaned into Seb's embrace, feeling incredibly at ease.

Just then, Seb's phone rang urgently.

He answered the call, and after hearing a few words, he suddenly looked down at Isabella, his expression turning serious.

###chapter 462: We're Going Home

Perhaps sensing something, Isabella's heart skipped a beat. She held her breath and listened intently to the voice on the other end of the phone, but she could only make out two words.

"Okay, I understand." Seb said before hanging up the phone.

He held the phone in one hand and gently supported the back of Isabella's head with the other, looking down at her. "There's something that might not be good."

Isabella's breath caught. "Is it my mom?"

Although she had spent very little time with Esme, Isabella understood Esme's character well.

Esme was beautiful and talented. Even in middle age, Esme still retained her charm. Back in the day, someone like Bruno had gone to great lengths to ruin her original husband's family just to be with her, so it's easy to imagine how stunning she must have been in her youth.

During the prime of her life, Esme must have had no shortage of suitors. After marrying Bruno, she furthered her studies, becoming a renowned international designer.

Clearly, Esme was a woman of ambition and vision.

But tonight, such humiliation occurred. Her stepson stripped her clothes in front of so many people and revealed all the terrible things Bruno had done in the past.

Each of these incidents was a blow to Esme.

It seemed almost inevitable that Esme would take her own life.

"Yes," Seb nodded, instructing the driver to turn around while trying to calm Isabella. "It might not be that bad. Let's go back to check it out."

"Okay," Isabella agreed, her heart pounding, but she tried to stay calm.

The car had just left the estate and hadn't gone far before it turned back.

After getting out of the car, Isabella's feet sank into the grass as if she were walking on clouds. The sensation spread from her feet throughout her body.

If Seb hadn't been holding her hand, Isabella wouldn't have known how to move forward.

As they rounded the backyard, they saw that Richard and the others had already moved everyone into the yard.

Quentin was there too.

Quentin had bloodstains on him and stood beside Esme, head bowed.

Hearing footsteps, Quentin looked up at Isabella, a clear expression of guilt flashing in his eyes.

Esme lay on the ground, covered in blood, her face also smeared with it.

Richard walked over and said in a low voice, "She tried to take Wade down with her, but he took the knife and stabbed her instead. I've called an ambulance; it should be here soon."

He then turned to Isabella. "She's been calling your name. You should go see her."

Richard and his group lived dangerous lives, and one look was enough to tell that Esme was critically injured.

This wound could be fatal.

If they hadn't called Isabella back, she might not have had the chance to see Esme one last time.

Seb let go of Isabella's hand. "Go ahead."

Isabella walked over unsteadily, her eyes glued to Esme, unable to look away.

Esme lay flat, her chest rising and falling weakly.

Hearing the footsteps, Esme slowly opened her eyes. "Bella."

She reached out her hand to Isabella.

Isabella hesitated for a moment before slowly squatting down.

Isabella took Esme's hand but couldn't say a word.

"Bella," Esme cooed with a self-deprecating smile. "The person I've wronged the most in my life is you. Don't forgive me, not ever."

Isabella shook her head gently.

Esme took a breath and continued, "Seb is a good man, worth spending your life with. The Jose family are good people too. My daughter, meeting these people is your good fortune. I don't deserve it. I just hope that the rest of your life will be safe and happy."

Isabella's eyes welled up. "Don't say that. I was angry with you, but I never hated you."

Esme shook her head, seemingly out of strength.

Isabella sobbed anxiously, "I know you bribed the doctor to switch my heart surgery. You didn't sacrifice me for Lova. Sometimes I understand your difficulties. Mom, don't die. Come back to Lakina with me. I'll take good care of you."

Quentin, standing nearby, was visibly shaken by these words.

Quentin first looked at Esme, then slowly turned to Isabella. His gaze lingered on Isabella's heart for a moment, and pain quickly spread across his face.

Esme smiled. "Bella, thank you."

"Mom." Isabella cried.

"I think I see Lova," Esme said, her eyes fixed on the sky with a loving smile. "I miss Lova so much. Lova has come to take me. Quentin."

Esme suddenly called Quentin's name.

Quentin stood there, unmoving.

"Quentin." Esme called urgently, as if she had some last words to say, or as if she couldn't die in peace without Quentin's response.

But Quentin just stood there, unmoved.

It wasn't until Isabella looked up at Quentin, Isabella's eyes full of earnest pleading, that he frowned and took a couple of steps forward.

Quentin didn't squat down but stood straight.

He looked down at Esme with a complex expression.

"Quentin." Esme reached out her other hand to him.

That hand stayed in the air for seven or eight seconds, but Quentin didn't respond.

He just stood there coldly, watching coldly.

Esme finally ran out of strength, and her hand fell heavily.

"Mom," Isabella's tears kept falling.

Esme closed her eyes, took a moment, and sighed softly.

After a while, she opened her eyes and looked at Quentin. "Quentin, I know you haven't been able to let go of Lova all these years. I beg you, for Lova's sake, can you let Bella go?"

Quentin didn't respond.

Quentin pressed his lips together, refusing to give an answer.

Esme just looked at him. "Quentin. In my bedroom safe, there's a diary. It's Lova's diary. When I die, you can take it."

Hearing about Lova's diary, Quentin's cold face finally showed a hint of change.

He turned and almost immediately headed towards the Black Family villa.

He walked quickly, eager to get that diary.

Esme held Isabella's arm, her body suddenly trembling. "Bella, I'm not going to make it. I'm sorry. I have to go now. Live a good life."

Esme's words stopped there.

Isabella held her, clearly feeling a vibrant life slowly slipping away.

"Mom." Isabella called out again and again, but there was no response.

When she looked down, Esme had already closed her eyes peacefully, falling into a deep sleep.

The sound of the ambulance came and went.

Isabella still knelt on the grass. It was late, and the dampness from the grass seeped through her skin, sending chills through her body.

Suddenly, she felt a weight on her shoulder and turned to meet Seb's eyes.

"Bella, let's go home." Seb whispered.

###chapter 463: Crybaby

After that day, Bruno and Esme died.

After stabbing Esme, Wade escaped through the secret passage of the Black Family.

Even though Richard and Quentin's people were looking for him, there has been no trace of him so far.

Richard took the evidence of Wade killing Bruno and Esme and spent half a month, using both soft and hard tactics, to bring the Black Family under his control.

During this half month, Isabella and Seb stayed in a hotel, and the two were almost inseparable.

After recovering, Isabella called Lakina.

For some reason, Nina's phone was always unreachable.

Isabella had to call the Jose family.

Kelsey answered the phone.

As soon as she heard it was Isabella, Kelsey screamed, "Mom and Dad, come quickly! Bella is on the phone!"

Then there was a rush of hurried and chaotic footsteps on the other end.

Next, the phone was handed to Margaret.

"Hello, Is it Bella?" Margaret asked softly.

After many days, hearing this gentle voice again, Isabella's nose tingled, and she almost couldn't hold back her tears.

She quickly responded, "It's me, Margaret. How are you?"

"I'm very well, we are all very well. And you? How are you? Did Seb find you? Are you with Seb now?" Margaret asked a lot in one breath.

Isabella patiently answered all of questions one by one.

The warmth from the Jose family quickly filled Isabella's exhausted heart.

Suddenly, a childish voice came from the other end. "Mommy."

Isabella was stunned, her heart seemed to be hit hard by something, not painful, but with an indescribable tingling sensation.

"Mommy." Sweetie's voice came again.

Isabella wanted to respond to Sweetie, but all her emotions surged up in an instant. She covered her mouth and nose, and tears streamed down her face.

"Mommy." Sweetie kept calling on the other end, her childish voice forming the most beautiful music in the world.

Sweetie didn't seem to get tired, continuing to call. It seemed that if she didn't get a response from her mommy, she would keep calling.

Seb patted Isabella's shoulder, took the phone from her hand, and said, "Hello, Sweetie, it's Daddy."

"Daddy." Sweetie called joyfully.

Maybe at her age, Sweetie didn't know what daddy and mommy were.

But humans are born with this ability to sense, and hearing their parents' voices, children feel especially happy.

Sweetie's laughter kept coming from the receiver, sometimes calling daddy, sometimes calling mommy.

Isabella cried uncontrollably beside Seb.

Even after the call ended, she couldn't come out of that overwhelming emotion.

So, she rushed into the bathroom and washed her face with cold water.

Her emotions finally calmed down.

Isabella looked at herself in the mirror, feeling helpless.

She's always been so fragile, tears start falling at the slightest thing, like she's never changed.

Now she was already a mother, and if she remained so fragile, how could she protect her child in the future?

But to change, she didn't know where to start for a while.

As she was worrying, the bathroom door was pushed open by Seb.

He stood at the door, not in a hurry to come in, looking at her with a bit of amusement.

Their eyes met in the mirror, Isabella bit her lip, a little embarrassed, "Did you hang up the phone?"

"Yes" Seb answered.

Isabella turned around, "But I haven't talked to Sweetie yet."

Seb looked seriously at her tear-red eyes, "Are you sure you want to talk now? I'm afraid you can't control it, and you'll cry as soon as you speak."

Seb walked in, holding Isabella's shoulders with both hands, "Let's wait a bit. If you make Sweetie cry too, I'll have to comfort two people."

Isabella's cheeks turned red at his words, "I just miss Sweetie too much."

She didn't want to cry either.

She just couldn't help it when things happened.

When she encountered bad people, she could become tough.

But when she met people she cared about, she couldn't control her tears.

"I know it's not good like this, I'll change in the future." Isabella lowered her head, her words lacking confidence.

Seb laughed, "No need to change."

Isabella looked up at him.

Her tear-red lower eyelids were slightly swollen, and her lips were bitten red, looking very pitiful.

Seb's heart softened, he pecked her lips lightly, saying, "With me here, I won't let you and Sweetie suffer anymore. Cry if you want to cry, laugh if you want to laugh, just be yourself, no need to change."

Isabella finally smiled.

His words made her feel at ease, secure.

She shyly burrowed into his arms like a little girl, wrapped her arms around his slender waist, and pressed her whole face against his chest, "Seb, sometimes I really love you so much."

Seb's chin rested on the top of her head, his fingers lightly pinching her slender waist, "Sometimes?"

Isabella shrank from the tickle, "Every time."

Seb's light laughter came from above her head, he hugged her tighter.

And Isabella also tightened her arms, leaning in his embrace, feeling extremely happy.

In the afternoon, Seb went out.

He originally wanted to take Isabella with him, but when he finished the call and returned to the room, he found her asleep on the sofa.

The phone was on her chest, still ringing.

Seb gently took the phone away, the screen showed a short video sent by Kelsey, a video of Sweetie eating.

Sweetie was eating happily, with a sweet smile.

Seb's thumb gently brushed over Sweetie's cute little face on the screen, then he turned off the phone.

Isabella was sleeping deeply.

In fact, she hadn't rested well in the past half month, with a faint dark circle under her eyes.

Seb gazed at her for a moment, put down the phone, picked her up from the sofa, walking to the bed.

Seb was also very tired.

But he had more important things to deal with, so he couldn't just sleep holding her.

Seb lay beside her for two minutes, kissed her cheek and forehead, then reluctantly withdrew his arm, tucked her in, and got up to leave.

Jack was already waiting outside, holding a briefcase. When Seb came out, Jack was looking at his watch.

As soon as Seb came out, Jack stood up straight, "Mr. Landon, the car is already waiting downstairs."

"Okay." Seb paused, extending his hand, "Give me the briefcase."

"Mr. Landon, let me carry it." Jack said, "I'm not tired."

Seb glanced at him, "I'm not worried about tiring you out, I'm asking you to stay here, I can handle the cooperation alone."

Jack felt a bit awkward, "But."

"I don't feel at ease leaving Bella alone here." Seb said concisely, "You stay, in case anything happens, I'll be at ease."

In the past two years, no one understood better than Jack how Seb and Isabella had gotten through.

So he understood Seb's intentions, if anything happened to Isabella again, Seb would also collapse.

Jack nodded, "I'll stay. You take care of yourself too."

"Don't worry." Seb replied.

###chapter 464: Diary

Isabella slept for four hours.

When she woke up, it was already dark outside the window.

The room was unlit. As Isabella got up from the bed, she saw a figure sitting on the sofa.

The man had his back to her, and the moonlight from outside cast a long, slanted shadow on the floor.

"Seb?" Isabella asked.

Because of the lighting, Isabella couldn't see him clearly, so she reached out to turn on the light.

When the orange light came on, she looked again to see the man had already turned his head..

Isabella could now see his face clearly and gasped, "Quentin?"

She scrambled to get out of bed, but to leave the room, she had to pass by the sofa.

She couldn't be sure if she could get past Quentin smoothly.

Just from Quentin's presence here, it was clear he wouldn't let her leave easily.

Isabella hesitated for a few seconds and then look for her phone on the bed.

It wasn't on the nightstand or under the pillow.

Her eyes scanned the room and she suddenly noticed her phone was on the coffee table in front of Quentin.

Her last hope of escape vanished, and a sense of helplessness filled Isabella's heart.

All her previous actions had been observed by Quentin.

While Isabella was frantically searching for her phone, he just sat there quietly, watching her.

It wasn't until Isabella realized her hope was gone and looked back at him that he slowly spoke, "Isabella."

Hearing Quentin call her name made Isabella's heart tighten, "How did you get in?"

Quentin didn't answer her question but raised his hand.

In his hand, he held a pink notebook.

Isabella almost instantly guessed that it was Lova's diary.

That night at the Black Family, Esme had mentioned it before she died. At that time, Quentin had dropped everything to go look for it.

Now it seemed he had found it and had already read its contents.

But Isabella didn't know what Quentin wanted from her.

"There are some words she left for you in here. Take a look." Quentin voiced.

"Words for me?" Isabella was skeptical.

The first time she met Lova was in that cold, medicine-scented hospital room.

At that time, Lova was emaciated, kept alive only by expensive medical equipment. Even just staying alive had taken all of Lova's strength, so this diary must have been written when she was still healthy.

And back then, Isabella and Lova had no intersection.

Would Lova write about Isabella in Lova's diary?

Isabella felt that Quentin was more likely trying to lure her over.

So instead of moving forward, she took two steps back.

Quentin watched her actions and seemed to understand her thoughts. He frowned in displeasure and uttered, "If I had any other intentions, I would have done something while you were asleep. I wouldn't have waited until now."

There was some truth to his words.

But it still wasn't enough to convince Isabella.

Quentin lost his patience and made a move to get up from the sofa.

"Don't move!" Isabella called out softly.

Quentin indeed stopped moving.

Isabella knew that in this situation, she was at a disadvantage.

Since Quentin is inherently overly paranoid, provoking him would only backfire. It's better to go along with him and see what he's up to.

After much deliberation, Isabella finally made a decision, "I'll get it myself."

Quentin didn't object, sitting back down on the sofa.

Isabella walked over, took the diary from his hand, and quickly retreated back to the bed.

Throughout the process, Quentin made no extra movements.

After handing her the diary, Quentin turned his head to straighten the creases on his sleeve.

Isabella relaxed a bit and then looked down at the diary.

The diary was pink, it's cover had started to fade, but it still showed a cute cartoon character.

Isabella opened the diary, and inside were neat, delicate writings with stickers that a young girl would love adorning the corners.

Isabella's eyes fell on the name.

Lova.

In her mind, Isabella pictured Lova's emaciated body.

A deep sense of helplessness rose from Isabella's heart.

She didn't know how to describe this feeling. When she first saw Lova, she felt scared. Now that Lova was dead, Isabella only felt regret when she thought of her.

A young life, full of promise, lost in the springtime of her years.

With so many strong men and such powerful resources in the Black Family, they still couldn't save one girl.

That was the greatest tragedy.

Isabella turned to the first page of Lova's diary, and the clear writing came into view.

[July 8

Weather: Light rain

Mood: Annoyed

It's raining again. I really hate rainy days.

The sky is gloomy, and when I came back from school, the entire windowsill was wet, and even my new curtains weren't spared.

These are my favorite curtains. I picked them out and hung them up myself.

July 9

Weather: Light rain

Mood: Okay

The rain drizzled all night, and there was thunder in the middle of the night. It was so scary.

Because of my curtains, I didn't sleep well all night.

My mood was terrible, and it directly affected my interest in going to dance class today.

But things always take a turn. Quentin knocked on the door and brought me a surprise.

A set of curtains exactly like mine. He brought a ladder and replaced them for me himself.

I was very happy.

My mood improved a lot.

But how did Quentin get the curtains so quickly?

These curtains were custom-made, from the fabric to the cutting and sewing, it took fifteen days.

I asked him, and he just smiled and didn't answer.

I think Quentin can do magic.]

Lova's diary was filled with love and sweetness, sometimes with childish sentences.

The earlier entries were about daily life, with Quentin, Esme, and Elodie occasionally appearing in Lova's diary.

Two people rarely mentioned in the diary were Bruno and Wade.

Isabella silently flipped through the pages and finally saw Wade's appearance.

[December 24

Weather: Snow

Mood: Good. But also a bit not good

I hate rain, but I love snowy days.

Snowflakes are so white, beautiful, and romantic.

Today is Christmas Eve. Elodie and I bought some decorations to decorate the house.

Elodie went to decorate the rooms, and I was in charge of the living room.

While hanging decorations outside, the ladder suddenly slipped, and I fell from a height.

At that moment, I was holding onto the decorations tightly, thinking I was done for and would be seriously hurt.

But as I fell, I landed on someone.

I looked up and saw it was Wade.

I quickly got up from him, but his hand tightly gripped my waist.

I was stunned for a moment.

Then his hand...]

###chapter 465: Darkness

The latter part of the diary was written but then crossed out by someone.

Isabella thought about what Wade did to Esme and could guess that Wade must have done something to Lova back then.

Isabella eagerly wanted to read further.

But she found that the dates jumped to six months later.

In between, there were obvious signs of many pages being torn out.

Perhaps after that incident, Lova wrote something in her diary, but she didn't think it was very good, so she tore it out.

[June 18

Weather: Sunny

Mood: Very happy

Today is my birthday, and I am so happy.

I must eat more cake today. My mom usually doesn't let me eat these things to keep my figure.

Today is a good opportunity. I must eat and drink more while there are many people around.

Ah, I really want to eat cake.

I wish I didn't have to dance in front of the guests today.

Oh, I have a big birthday wish: I hope to see my sister soon, not Elodie. Another sister, the one Mom gave birth to. Mom said her name is Isabella.

Isabella, happy birthday to me.

And I wish you happiness every day.

June 9

Weather: Dark

It's 1 AM on the 9th.

I was raped by Wade.

He put something in my juice. I hate him, no, I despise him.

I want to kill him!!]

This diary entry was only a few lines, but the handwriting was different from the previous neat and delicate style. Every stroke was written with difficulty.

Isabella could almost see that dark night, Lova leaning on the desk, her nails digging in so hard they almost broke.

That bastard Wade really raped Lova.

Lova was Wade's sister!

What kind of mindset did Wade have to do such a thing?

Just reading these words made Isabella feel suffocated. At this moment, she couldn't imagine what kind of devastation Lova went through after experiencing all this.

Isabella flipped further but found nothing more.

She kept flipping to the last page, getting more anxious as she went.

She was desperate to know what happened next and more about Lova's fate.

But when Isabella reached the last page, it was all blank.

All the diary entries ended there, with no more records or signs of torn pages.

This indicated that after that, Lova never wrote in the diary again. Perhaps she had locked it away in a drawer, never to be picked up again.

A sense of helplessness suddenly arose in Isabella's heart.

"What are you looking for?" Quentin's voice sounded above her.

Isabella found that Quentin had somehow appeared behind her.

Startled, Isabella dropped the diary on the ground.

Quentin frowned slightly, picked up the diary, and gently wiped the dust off with his sleeve. "You don't need to look anymore. She never touched this diary again after that day."

After reading the diary, Isabella was engulfed in a deep gloom. Her throat felt choked, and she didn't know what to say.

Quentin's gaze swept over her slightly reddened eyes, coed, "Because she mentioned you in her diary, I thought she would want you to know about her. So I came to find you."

Isabella lowered her eyes, still feeling a sting in the corners.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

Jack's voice came through the door, "Isabella?"

Isabella was about to go open the door but was pulled back by Quentin, "Don't open it."

Isabella was puzzled.

"Tell him to leave. I will go." Quentin whispered.

Isabella thought Quentin might really be here just for the diary.

Not wanting to make things difficult for him, she said towards the door, "Jack, what's up?"

"I brought you some fruit." Jack answered.

"Leave it at the door. I'll get it later."

Jack paused for a moment outside the door and said, "Okay."

Then Jack left.

Only then did Quentin let go of Isabella's hand, speaking in a low voice, "Thank you."

Isabella shook her head, "You should go."

She didn't want to make things difficult for Quentin, entirely because of Lova.

But that didn't mean she could forgive everything Quentin had done to her.

Quentin didn't say anything more and turned to leave.

After that night, Isabella had several dreams, all featuring Lova.

A few days later, Seb told her that Wade was dead.

Wade was found in a garbage dump, and when Richard arrived with his men, Quentin had already gotten there first.

Afterward, Quentin shot Wade in front of everyone.

"Did Wade just die like that?" Isabella was a bit indignant.

Thinking about everything Wade did to Lova, Isabella felt that letting Wade die so easily was too lenient.

Scum like Wade should be tortured.

Seb held her hand, "Quentin's shot didn't hit a vital spot. Wade wasn't dead at the time, but if not treated in time, he would slowly bleed to death. Someone called the police, they took Wade and got him the best doctor."

Isabella clenched her fingers, feeling even more absurd.

She initially thought a single shot was too easy for Wade. Now she felt it would have been better to send him to hell, rather than risk him escaping.

Someone as rotten to the core as Wade didn't deserve to live.

Seb seemed to read her thoughts and smiled, "Don't worry, he won't escape."

Isabella looked at Seb, blinking in confusion, waiting for him to continue.

"Do you know who the best doctor in Silvercrest is?" Seb asked.

Isabella blinked, and a face suddenly popped into her mind.

But she couldn't recall the name.

Seb replied, "Jason."

Isabella suddenly understood.

Seb continued, "Jason took the job to treat Wade. But within a few days, Wade's wound started to fester and grow maggots. He felt an unbearable itch, as if it was crawling all over his body. At first, Wade could endure it, but one night, he couldn't take it anymore. He tore off the bandage, revealing a highly rotten and foul-smelling wound, with maggots constantly wriggling out."

Hearing this, Isabella couldn't help but feel nauseous.

Seb stopped, "Sorry, I shouldn't have told you this."

Isabella held back her nausea, her eyes red, "I still think Wade didn't suffer enough. But isn't Jason one of Bruno's men? Why would he do this to Wade?"

"It's said that Lova saved Jason's life back then. So to Jason, only Lova was his benefactor. And I think you can tell, Jason's feelings for Lova were not ordinary." Seb explained softly.

###chapter 467: What Do You Know

It's said Wade died a horrible death.

When Isabella heard the news, she didn't feel particularly happy.

Wade was scum and not worth mourning, but it was regrettable that Lova's once beautiful life was completely ruined, and she could never come back.

Seeing Isabella's lack of enthusiasm, Seb invited her to the riverside to watch the fireworks.

The fireworks in Silvercrest were renowned. As dusk settled, a luxurious cruise ship slowly sailed down the river. Isabella leaned against the railing, feeling the river breeze brush her cheeks, and finally, her mood began to calm.

Massive fireworks shot into the sky, drawing a bright line in the dark night before blooming into brilliant flowers after a few seconds.

One after another, the fireworks lit up the river.

Isabella was still in awe when she felt something fall from the sky into the river.

She caught it, realizing it was a rose petal.

Isabella was even more astonished to see a rain of rose petals falling from the sky.

In no time, the cruise ship was covered in petals.

The crowd watching the fireworks by the river let out a faint cheer.

Following the sound, she saw the fireworks in the sky forming a sentence.

"Bella, marry me."

Isabella unconsciously read it aloud, catching a glimpse of a tall figure approaching.

She saw Seb, dressed in a suit, walking towards her step by step.

When he reached her, he knelt on one knee, holding a box with a sparkling diamond ring inside.

Seb solemnly proposed, "Bella, let's get married."

"The last wedding was my fault for not considering everything, which led to an accident. This time, please give me your hand. I promise I won't let you get hurt again."

"Bella, marry me."

Isabella covered her mouth, emotions surging within her. After calming down, she finally said, "I do."

Seb placed the ring on her finger, then embraced her.

That night, the fireworks by the river lasted for over an hour.

In a building by the river, Richard watched everything through the window.

He downed his drink, then sat on the sofa, sending a video he had just recorded to Nina.

He had just sent it when he realized it failed to deliver.

Richard frowned slightly, not knowing when Nina had deleted him.

But upon reflection, it made sense.

Richard thought for a moment and called his assistant in. "Book me a flight back to Lakina, the earliest available."

The assistant looked puzzled. "You want to go back to Lakina? But there's a shareholders' meeting tomorrow."

Richard had forgotten about that..

Now that he was the head of the Black Family, his position was not yet secure.

Beneath the seemingly calm surface, who knew how many undercurrents lay in wait.

He had to attend tomorrow's shareholders' meeting.

Richard's brow furrowed deeply. After a moment, he said in a low voice, "Then book it for after the meeting."

"But after the meeting, you have many other engagements."

Richard's brow furrowed even deeper. "What's the latest I can leave?"

The assistant said, "Your schedule is packed for the next six months."

"No later than three months! Arrange all the engagements and expedite everything." Ricahrd voiced seriously.

A hint of worry flashed across the assistant's face. He want to say something but gave up when he saw Richard's determined expression.

Richard sat alone on the sofa, repeatedly trying to add Nina as a friend.

There was no response.

He called Nina, but the number was no longer in service.

Richard knew Nina's temper too well. She was cutting him out of her life completely.

"Nina, wait for me. When I'm done, I'll go back to Lakina and apologize in person." Richard murmured, his fingers tracing the edges of his phone.

The scene tonight was too overwhelming. Quentin stood on a high building, quietly watching the fireworks show.

Then he took out a yellowed diary from his pocket. "Lova, did you see that? No matter what, the people you cared about finally got a good ending."

"Lova, I let Isabella go. Would that make you happy?"

As Quentin spoke, tears silently fell, dripping onto the diary.

He heard light footsteps behind him and turned to see Jason.

Quentin's gaze swept over Jason's face. "You're here."

Jason stood there, gripping the gun hidden in his sleeve tighter. "You knew I would come?"

Quentin sneered lightly. "If I hadn't deliberately leaked my whereabouts, do you think you could have found me so quickly?"

Jason didn't understand why Quentin would leak his whereabouts and thought he might have set a trap, so he cautiously observed his surroundings.

"Relax, it's just you and me here." Quentin reassured.

Jason was still wary but didn't back down. Even if there was a trap, he was determined to face it.

Quentin reached into his pocket, and Jason nervously drew his gun, pointing it at Quentin.

Quentin paused, then set the diary on fire with his lighter.

Jason's eyes widened. "Is that..."

Quentin didn't answer. He held the corner of the burning diary, not flinching even as the flames reached his fingers.

The burning flesh emitted an indescribable smell.

Jason frowned. "Quentin, do you think this will atone for your sins? What you did to Lova was worse than what that scum Wade did."

Quentin frowned, his expression serious. "Don't compare me to that scum Wade. I'm not like him!"

"You're right. Wade was a scumbag who couldn't control his urges, and you're a lunatic who can't control your mind!" Jason shouted.

Quentin's sharp gaze fell on Jason's face.

Jason wasn't afraid. Instead, he smiled. "Lova was first destroyed by Wade, then tortured by you until she died. Quentin, ask yourself, if you hadn't forcibly hypnotized her, would she have ended up in such pain?"

Jason continued, "Lova was too kind. She always thought you could be saved, so in her few moments of clarity, she never harmed you. But she was wrong. You took advantage of her kindness, hypnotized her, and made her love you under hypnosis. But when she was clear-headed, she regretted it deeply. Quentin, do you even deserve to be called human?"

Jason's words seemed to hit a nerve. Quentin's eyes turned red, glaring at Jason with a murderous look.

After a long pause, Quentin sneered, "What do you know?"

###chapter 468: Return to Lakina

The diary was burned to ashes in Quentin's hands, and a large part of his hand was also burned.

The searing and sharp pain slowly transmitted through his nerves, but it was nothing compared to the pain in Quentin's heart.

Quentin murmured, "The Black Family looks glamorous on the surface, but inside it's filthy and disgusting. From Bruno to Wade, there's not a single good one. A pure girl like Lova is wasted in the Black Family. I want to take her away from the Black Family. In this world, only I truly love and care for her. Only by being with me can she remain completely pure."

"If you really loved her, you wouldn't do this to her! Quentin, you're a complete psycho!" Jason shouted.

Quentin smiled, "Say whatever you want."

Jason gripped his gun tightly, "I live to kill you and Wade. Now that Wade is in hell, how can you not join him?"

The gunshot rang out.

The bullet pierced through Quentin's forehead, leaving a dark, bloody hole.

Quentin's body stiffened, and in an instant, he fell backward off the building.

A few minutes later, the sound of police and ambulance sirens came from below.

Jason fell to his knees, feeling as if all his strength had been drained, even his soul seemed absent.

He looked up at the pitch-black night sky, as if he could see that bright and pure girl again.

On that cold winter morning, Lova appeared before him, and at that moment, he thought he saw an angel.

"Lova." Tears streamed down Jason's face. After calling her name a few times, he shot himself.

When Michael arrived, he heard the gunshot.

He stood in front of Jason's body for a long time before silently leaving.

Three days later.

At the airport.

As Isabella and the others entered the waiting area, they saw Michael waiting there.

At Michael's feet was a suitcase.

Michael pushed the suitcase over, holding a ticket and documents in his hand. He said to Isabella and Seb, "Richard is tied up with something, so he asked me to go back to Lakina with you."

Isabella had already learned about Nina's miscarriage from Seb. She had spoken with the Jose family a few times during this period, but Nina was never around.

Worried about Nina's condition, Isabella asked, "When will Richard return to Lakina?"

Michael shook his head, "I don't know. The situation in Silvercrest is unstable right now, and Richard probably won't be able to return anytime soon."

"What about Nina?" Isabella questioned.

Michael handed over a letter to Isabella. "This is a letter from Richard. He can't reach Nina right now, so he asked you to take it back. Richard said he'll return as soon as he's done here."

"Okay." Isabella nodded, "I know everything Richard does is for me and Seb. Tell Richard not to worry, I'll help comfort Nina."

Michael nodded, "That's exactly what Richard wanted to hear."

The flight lasted over four hours.

When the plane landed, the sky over Lakina was clear.

The Jose family had arrived at the airport early to wait. As soon as Isabella got off the plane, she almost ran out.

She immediately saw the Jose family and Sweetie sitting in a stroller.

Sweetie was holding a rattle. When she saw Isabella, she waved her arms excitedly, her big eyes sparkling, and she giggled.

Isabella tried to hold back her tears and tentatively clapped her hands at Sweetie, "Sweetie? Want a hug from Mommy?"

Sweetie reached out her chubby little hands and tightly grasped Isabella's fingers, "Mommy, hug."

Isabella's heart melted instantly, and tears rolled down her cheeks.

She bent down, picked Sweetie up from the stroller, and held her soft, sweet-smelling little body in her arms.

Sweetie obediently lay on her shoulder, calling, "Mommy."

Isabella gently kissed Sweetie's forehead, "Sweetie."

Seb gently embraced his wife and daughter.

The Jose family, along with Michael who was quietly watching from the side, all had tears in their eyes.

Michael looked at Kelsey, who was standing with Jack, holding Jack's arm, her eyes red as she wiped her tears.

Jack took out a handkerchief to wiped Kelsey's eyes gently.

During Seb's time in Silvercrest, Jack had been traveling back and forth.

Sometimes Jack would be gone for a week, and this time he had stayed for over a month.

Kelsey, being a clingy girl, was emotionally touched. With Jack being so gentle, she quickly kissed his cheek when no one was looking.

Just after the kiss, she felt a pair of eyes on her.

She looked over and met Michael's amused gaze.

Kelsey felt instantly embarrassed.

Just as she was about to glare back, Michael's phone rang. He greeted Seb and Zaire before turning to leave.

With Michael gone, Kelsey felt more at ease.

"Bella, welcome home." Kelsey gave Isabella a big hug.

Zaire took the suitcase and said, "Let's go home first. Knowing you were coming back, Mom has prepared a lot of delicious food."

"Yes." Kelsey chimed in, "Mom started studying recipes a week in advance, and Dad was even more exaggerated. As soon as he knew you were coming back, he started ordering cakes and drinks. I haven't seen them this happy in a long time."

As Isabella walked out with them, she asked, "Where's Nina? Why didn't she come?"

Mentioning Nina, the warm atmosphere slightly tensed.

Kelsey said, "Nina is waiting for you at home. You'll see when you get there."

Hearing this, Isabella felt even more uneasy.

It wasn't convenient to ask on the way, so she held her unease until they finally arrived at the Jose family home.

As soon as the car entered the yard, Isabella saw Nina.

Nina was standing on the steps, wrapped in a thick coat, wearing a beige knit hat, and a scarf around her neck.

Nina looked well bundled up, but as soon as Margaret got out of the car, she had a servant bring a pair of cotton shoes for Nina to change into.

Nina smiled wryly, "Mom, this is too much."

Margaret took the cotton shoes from the servant and placed them at Nina's feet herself, "It's not too much. If your heels get cold now, they'll crack when you're older, and it can be excruciating. Be good and put on the cotton shoes."

Nina could only smile helplessly and change into the cotton shoes.

The temperature in Lakina was lower than in Silvercrest. Isabella felt the chill as soon as she got out of the car, and standing at the door for a while made her sneeze.

Nina quickly took Isabella's hand and rubbed it in her palms, "It's chilly out here. Let's go inside."

###chapter 468: Getting Older, Afraid of Noise

The living room was already prepared with various teas and snacks by the servants.

Everyone took off their coats after entering the house.

Nina was feeling uncomfortable from the heat, with beads of sweat forming on her forehead. As soon as she took off her coat, Margaret came over with a tissue to wipe the sweat from her forehead.

Nina reached out for the tissue and said, "Mom, I can do it myself."

At her age, Nina felt quite embarrassed to be taken care of like a child by her mother.

Margaret emphasized, "You need to wipe off the sweat immediately. You're a bit vulnerable right now, so be careful not to get sick."

"Okay." Nina nodded and obediently wiped off the sweat.

A servant brought over two cups of warm tea, one for Nina and one for Isabella.

Isabella rejected, "I don't need it."

Margaret said, "You just came in from outside. Drinking some warm tea will be good for you."

"Bella, just listen to Mom. She knows best." Kelsey voiced cheerfully from the side.

Margaret looked at Kelsey lovingly and said, "There's one for you too."

As soon as she finished speaking, the servant brought over a few more cups.

Everyone, including the men, had a cup.

Nina was on a special diet for her health, so her dinner was different from everyone else's.

Isabella glanced at Nina's meal, which seemed too bland. Nina barely ate anything. By the end of the meal, Nina had only eaten a couple of leaves of green vegetables and hadn't touched the soups at all.

After dinner, Isabella accompanied Nina upstairs.

Everyone else knew they wanted to talk privately, so they didn't follow.

Nina lay down on the bed, looking healthy but with a certain emptiness in her eyes.

Isabella knew it was a lack of vitality.

Whether it was with Charlie before or Richard later, children had always been Nina's pain.

Nina had finally gotten pregnant, which should have been a joyous occasion, but...

"Nina, this is from Richard. He said he'll come back to you once he's done with his work." Isabella took out Richard's letter while speaking.

As soon as the letter was handed over, Nina took it.

Without a moment's hesitation, Nina threw it into the trash can.

Isabella was stunned, "Nina?"

"Don't mention Richard again. I don't want to hear about him."

"But Richard..."

"Isabella!" Nina's smile finally disappeared, "Are you my sister or his? If you still consider me your sister, listen to me. Don't mention Richard again. If you do, I'll be upset with you."

Isabella knew Nina wouldn't really be upset with her. Nina was just using such decisive words to show her stance.

A month later, Isabella and Seb got married.

The night was very lively, and Nina was very happy, drinking quite a bit.

She kept holding onto Isabella, saying a lot of drunken words.

After a while, Isabella noticed that Nina had opened her eyes, staring blankly at the ceiling with a dazed expression.

"Nina?" Isabella gently pushed Nina's shoulder.

Nina's tears suddenly rolled down.

Isabella was startled, "Nina? What's wrong?"

Nina wiped her tears, "I just feel like my life is too hard."

Isabella wanted to tell Nina that she had called Richard for her wedding.

Richard should be on his way now.

An hour ago, Seb had contacted Richard, and Richard should be arriving soon.

Isabella anxiously glanced outside, worried that Richard might not show up.

Nina had already stood up from the sofa, "It's getting late, Bella. I should go. You and Seb should rest early."

"Nina." Isabella stood up, holding her hand.

Nina patted her hand, "I'm fine."

As she walked out of the villa, Nina took out her car keys from her bag.

Just as she was about to get in the car, someone walked over.

"You drank so much, and you still dare to drive yourself?" A slightly teasing voice sounded in her ear.

Nina slightly stunned when she saw who it was.

She knew this was Ophelia's son. Maybe it was because she had been drinking, but she couldn't quite remember his name.

"Alvin." Alvin walked up to her and gentlemanly took the car keys from her hand, his gaze never leaving her face, "Why do you look so surprised to see me?"

Nina laughed, "No, it's just that I thought Ms. Murphy said you had gone back to Mosterwania. I'm a bit surprised to see you here. Maybe I remembered wrong."

Nina helplessly rubbed her forehead, "I've been so forgetful lately."

Alvin looked at her, his teasing gaze turning gentle, "Then you definitely shouldn't drive yourself home."

He tilted his head slightly, "My car is over there. You can ride with me, and I'll take you home."

Putting everything else aside, Alvin made a good point.

"I was actually thinking of calling a driver." Nina explained.

"Then just think of me as your driver." Alvin looked at Nina sincerely, "I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving you in the hands of a stranger in your condition."

Nina felt his words were somewhat ambiguous. She was friends with Ophelia but not familiar with Alvin.

Alvin seemed to understand her thoughts and smiled openly, "You helped my mom so much before. This is the least I can do for you. If you refuse, I can wait here with you for the driver."

As he spoke, he extended his hand, holding Nina's car keys in his palm.

"I didn't mean it that way." Nina felt a bit embarrassed.

Alvin's straightforwardness made her feel petty in comparison.

Refusing him repeatedly would make her seem pretentious. It was no big deal, but she was making it awkward.

Nina put away her car keys and stopped hesitating, "Then I'll trouble you."

Nina got into Alvin's car. Finding it stuffy inside, she rolled down the window a bit.

At the same time, she saw a black car pass by.

Nina thought the car looked familiar, like Michael's.

She was about to look when Alvin asked, "Want to listen to some music?"

Nina withdrew her gaze, "Better not. I'm getting old and can't handle the noise."

###chapter 469: What the Hell Are You Doing

Alvin chuckled and commented sincerely, "You're very funny."

Nina leaned her entire back against the seat with a wry smile, "You're the first person to say I'm funny."

"Really?" Alvin said while driving steadily, "How do others describe you?"

Nina seriously thought about the question.

"My ex-husband said I was a very dull person. My former friends said I was very boring. Some said I was very serious, and others said..." Suddenly, an image of Richard appeared in her mind.

She couldn't remember the exact day or location. Back then, they weren't very familiar with each other. Richard held a cigarette, his handsome figure half-leaning on the railing, eyes fixed on her with a faint smile. Pale blue smoke drifted from his teeth, slightly blurring his features. Nina heard his deep voice in the night, "Interesting."

"What else have people said about you?" Alvin's voice interrupted her thoughts.

Nina lowered her eyes, slightly collecting her scattered thoughts, speaking softly, "They said I'm old."

Alvin said, "Don't say that about yourself. Actually, you're not much older than me."

Nina laughed, "I know your age. Your mom said you haven't even graduated from college."

"So what? A person's age doesn't always match their maturity. Can't you see I'm a very deep man?" Alvin replied.

Nina glanced at him, "At most, you're a boy."

Alvin frowned, "What boy? I've been in relationships; I'm not some naive kid."

Nina shook her head and chuckled, not commenting on his words.

Michael's car braked sharply, the tires screeching against the ground. Richard, in the back seat, was thrown forward due to the sudden stop.

The documents on Richard's lap scattered all over the car.

Before Richard could get angry, Michael quickly said, "I think I just saw Nina."

The anger in Richard's eyes subsided as he turned to look out the window, "Where?"

Michael pointed behind them, "Just walked by."

Richard felt a headache, "Why aren't you chasing her?"

"I just caught a glimpse, the window was only half open, I'm not sure if it was her." Michael explained.

Richard was already getting impatient.

Michael quickly turned the car around, "She hasn't gone far, I'll catch up."

The car window was open, and a breeze blew in, chilling Nina's face.

Alvin said, "I'll close the window. Your face is almost frozen."

Nina leaned back, "OK."

Then Nina leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes to rest.

As Alvin closed the window, his gaze was again drawn to Nina's profile.

The next second.

A loud sound startled both Nina and Alvin.

The sound came from the rear of the car, and they felt a strong impact even inside the car.

Nina was thrown forward, and if not for her seatbelt, she would have hit the windshield.

"Careful!" Alvin immediately reached out to pull Nina, while he himself slammed into the steering wheel.

Half of Alvin's face was injured.

Before Nina and Alvin could react, Nina's car door was pulled open from the outside.

Nina only had time to see a black cashmere coat before her arm was grabbed by a large, strong hand.

If not for the seatbelt, she would have been pulled out.

"Nina, watch out!" Alvin's hand tightly gripped Nina's other arm.

At the same time, Alvin felt a cold, intimidating gaze.

Nina followed the edge of the cashmere coat upward and finally saw Richard standing outside the car.

Richard was dressed in black, standing silently by the car, his slightly sunken eyes showing fatigue, but his sharp gaze was intimidating. One hand was on the car door, the other gripping Nina's arm. His tall figure leaned slightly forward, lips tightly pressed together, exuding a powerful aura that warned others to stay away.

Even though Nina had seen Richard's gentle side, she was still stunned.

Nina sat in the car, momentarily forgetting how to react.

Until Richard bent down, and unbuckled her seatbelt. His hand supported her waist, about to lift her out of the car, Nina suddenly came to her senses, instinctively pushing against his broad shoulder, "Don't touch me!"

Richard paused slightly at her words.

Then he maintained his position, just looking at her.

Alvin, ignoring his own injuries, opened the car door, "Please stay away from my friend!"

Richard didn't respond, not even glancing at Alvin. He just stared at Nina, his gaze intense, "What did you just say to me?"

Nina, regaining some composure, looked Richard in the eye and repeated firmly, "Richard, don't touch me! I feel dirty! Disgusting!"

Richard's eyes instantly turned cold, anger almost bursting out.

Seeing this, Alvin frowned and reached out, "Please don't harass my friend."

As soon as Alvin's hand touched Richard's shoulder, Richard grabbed his wrist.

With a slight twist, Alvin's face changed dramatically.

Although there was no sound of bones breaking, Nina knew that Richard's move had definitely hurt Alvin.

"Richard!" Anger surged in Nina's heart. She immediately got out of the car,Â  standing in front of Alvin.

She glared at Richard, "What are you doing?"

Under the night sky, Nina's angry face was clearly visible to Richard.

Alvin pulled Nina back, "Stay behind me."

Nina pulled him back, "It's none of your business!"

"Nina!" Alvin, worried, held her arm, afraid she would get hurt confronting Richard.

This scene was particularly glaring to Richard.

He coldly glanced at Alvin holding Nina's hand, lightly biting his teeth.

"Richard." Michael walked over.

Seeing the scene, Michael's expression stiffened.

It seemed Michael had come at a bad time!

###chapter 470: We're Done

Michael glanced at Alvin, took a few steps forward, grabbed Alvin by the collar, and dragged Alvin aside.

No matter how much Alvin struggled, he was no match for Michael.

Nina wanted to intervene but was stopped by Michael. "Nina, take my advice and go back with Richard."

Nina frowned.

Michael looked at her expression, comfort her, "Richard has made countless efforts to see you, Nina. You should have a conscience."

"Conscience?" Nina was amused by Michael's words.

She turned to face Richard. "Alright. Let's talk about conscience. How do you want to discuss it?"

Given Richard's temperament, he had no patience for coaxing women.

But for him, Nina was that exception.

Richard's emotions fluctuated in his eyes, but he finally suppressed his anger. He held Nina's hand, coaxing softly, "Come back with me. I have something to tell you."

Nina glanced back at Alvin, who was still being restrained by Michael, and nodded. "Alright, I'll go back with you. Alvin is Ophelia's son; don't hurt him."

Richard didn't even look at Alvin. At this moment, his eyes were only on Nina, and he only listened to her.

"Don't worry, I'm not so bored as to kill someone irrelevant." Richard finished speaking, took Nina by the hand, and led her to the car.

Seeing this, Alvin shouted anxiously, "Nina, don't go with him!"

Nina turned back, "I'm fine. Michael, you crashed his car, so you have to pay for the repairs!"

Michael smiled and waved at her, "I'll pay for it, don't worry."

Nina left with Richard.

As the car drove away, Nina kept looking in the rearview mirror.

Richard frowned, made a left turn at the next intersection, and Nina could no longer see anything.

She withdrew her gaze but still didn't look at Richard, instead staring out the window, not even giving him a side glance.

Richard, feeling irritated, pulled the car over to the side of the road, locked the doors, and turned to embrace her.

Nina didn't resist, letting him pull her over to sit on his lap.

Nina's body was warm and soft. Richard buried his head in her neck, greedily kissing her delicate skin. "Nina, do you know how much I've missed you these days?"

After so many days, Richard's pent-up longing was finally released at this moment.

Richard didn't want to suppress himself; he wanted to show all his passion to Nina.

Soon, Nina's clothes were stripped down to just one piece.

"Is this how you discuss conscience with me?" Nina's cold voice rang out.

Richard stroked Nina's cheek with his thumb, seeing her cold and somewhat hateful expression reflected in his eyes. Richard felt a pang of pain in his heart.

He lowered his head in shame, took a while to compose himself, then looked up again, "The child's death was an accident."

Nina's eyes gradually turned from cold to mocking.

"I know nothing I say now will help. You have every right to be angry. Now that I'm back, you can take out your anger on me however you want." Richard spoke with soft tone.

Nina looked at him, amused. "Mr. Mille, now holding all the power of the Black Family and being the husband of the Black Family's daughter, you are incredibly powerful. What can a helpless person like me do to you?"

Richard frowned deeply, "Nina, don't talk to me like that."

"If Mr. Mille wants to hear sweet words, why not go back to your new wife, Elodie? Or with your current status and power, you can have any woman you want with just a wave of your hand. Why waste time on me?"

Richard's gaze locked onto her. "Nina, I can only tolerate hearing such words once. I didn't marry Elodie that day; it was all part of the plan."

Nina turned her head away, her voice cold. "I don't want to know about your plans. You don't need to tell me."

"Alright, I won't say anything." Richard gently comforted her, his palm brushing over her flat stomach. Thinking of the child, he felt a sharp pain in his heart. "Nina, we will have more children in the future. However many you want, we'll have. I promise you, I'll be a good husband and a good father."

Nina shook her head. "No, Richard, we're done."

As she finished speaking, the arm around her waist tightened. "Nina."

"You should know how important that child was to me. You should also know that with the child's death, there's no chance for us anymore. Richard, you don't owe me anything. The stab wound on your wedding day has already paid me back in full. Let's end this amicably. I believe you're a straightforward person, and so am I."

Before she could finish, Richard sealed her lips with his.

Richard's hand firmly held the back of her head, kissing her dominantly. There was a gentle fierceness in his kiss, as if he wanted to swallow all her resolute words.

Nina stiffened.

Richard's kiss was so passionate and familiar, the same kiss she had dreamed of countless times during their separation.

Back then, she was truly lovesick. Every time she woke from a dream, she would run to the balcony to look for him.

Each time, she returned disappointed.

Nina found herself a bit ridiculous. Despite all she had been through, she still felt a sense of admiration and longing for Richard, like a girl in her first love.

But a simple truth remained: the more she invested in a relationship, the more hurt she received.

She had deeply understood and experienced this truth, but now she was blinded by love, forgetting all the painful scars.

At this moment, Richard's kiss felt bitter to her.

She stiffened, not moving, her teeth clenched tightly, refusing his advances.

Perhaps Richard sensed her rejection, and his kiss gradually softened. He kissed her lips repeatedly, with a hint of pleading.

It even gave Nina the illusion that if she responded to him, he would be willing to kneel and apologize immediately.

But she no longer needed such an apology.

Finally, Richard stopped.

He looked down at Nina's swollen lips from the kiss, his voice hoarse. "Do you hate me that much?"

Nina didn't speak, choosing silence as her answer.

She thought her coldness would make Richard give up.

But in the next second, he reclined the seat and pressed her down completely.

###chapter 471: Helplessness

The car doors locked as the interior lights went off.

Richard stripped off the last piece of clothing from Nina, attempting to use his tenderness to melt her cold heart.

Nina hadn't seduced him, but his desire was already at its peak.

At the critical moment, Nina stopped him, "Enough, Richard!"

Richard stared at her indifferent face, unthreatened.

He leaned in closer, his handsome face hovering above, "Not enough! It will never be enough!"

Nina slowly shook her head, "Why bother?"

Richard bent down, kissing away the tears at the corner of Nina's eyes, his fingers threading through her hair, gently massaging her scalp.

Nina used to enjoy this gesture the most; his caresses could smooth over all the scars in her heart.

He always knew what she needed and was never stingy in giving it. Yet, he neglected the most important thing, allowing something that shouldn't have happened to occur.

"Nina, forgive me," he whispered.

Nina shook her head desperately.

The man held her firmly beneath him; she couldn't break free at all.

In the end, they still made love.

The atmosphere in the car was heated, and during the act, Richard called Nina's name over and over again.

At first, Nina shook her head desperately, but later, as all her strength was exhausted by Richard, she just lay there quietly, her body flushing red.

Afterwards.

After helping her get dressed, Richard held her for a while.

Smelling an indescribable odor filling the car, Nina suddenly felt nauseous, covered her mouth, and gagged a few times, her eyes instantly welling up with tears.

Richard kissed her cheek, placed her back in the passenger seat, and buckled her seatbelt, patting her hair, "Take a nap, I'll wake you when we get home."

Nina felt that she couldn't communicate with him anymore.

Even though she had said such resolute words, they were useless to Richard.

He was a dominant man, used to strategizing and having everything under his control. How could he be defeated by a few words from her?

He would only show weakness in front of her when he was willing, but that didn't mean Nina could easily push him away.

Nina felt very tired.

Her body was tired, and her heart was even more exhausted.

To avoid communication, she simply closed her eyes, not wanting to hear anything more from him.

When the car came to a stop, Nina opened her eyes.

She looked at the villa nestled in the woods, her eyes swelling with emotion.

Her car door was opened, and Richard lifted her out of the car.

They walked into the villa, greeted by the smell of dust.

All the furniture was covered with dust cloths, but Richard's eyes were immediately drawn to a bouquet of nearly wilted roses on the table.

He looked down at Nina, "You've been here?"

Nina lowered her eyes, refusing to communicate.

She had indeed been here more than once.

Every time she missed Richard unbearably, she would come to see if he had returned.

The villa was always cold and empty. She would wander upstairs and downstairs; every place here held memories of her and Richard making love.

She would bring a bouquet of flowers, take out a glass vase from the cabinet, trim the flower stems bit by bit, and place them in the vase.

She thought that if Richard ever came back, he would see her handiwork as soon as he walked in.

Unexpectedly, it had now become a kind of irony.

She hadn't been here for a long time.

This bouquet was bought before she went to Silvercrest to try to ruin the wedding. She thought it would have wilted by now, but it was still there.

Richard pulled off the dust cloth from the sofa and placed Nina on it, kissing her forehead, "Wait here for me."

Then he went to the kitchen.

Nina didn't leave because she had seen Richard lock all the doors and windows of the villa.

She couldn't leave.

And she knew that even if she left now, Richard would still find a way to bring her back.

Until she made him completely give up, she had no control.

Nina sighed, staring at the ceiling.

She used to like this man's dominance a bit, but now she found it somewhat repulsive.

The feeling of helplessness she had when Charlie's family entangled her was starting to resurface.

Richard came out of the kitchen, finding Nina was nowhere to be seen on the sofa.

He paused, looking towards the door first.

Nina's shoes were still quietly placed there.

A row of footprints on the floor led upstairs.

For some reason, Richard felt a sense of relief.

He carried a plate of spaghetti upstairs, the bedroom light was on, and the sound of water could be faintly heard from the bathroom.

He put down the spaghetti, turned to the closet to get clean bedding, and changed it. Just as he finished, Nina came out of the bathroom.

She was holding her stomach, one hand on the door frame, her face pale, "Richard."

As soon as she said that, her legs gave out, and she started to collapse.

A pair of strong arms caught her, and she fell into a warm embrace.

Richard carried her to the bed, covering her abdomen with the freshly changed blanket, "I cooked spaghetti for you."

Nina shook her head, "My stomach hurts."

In just a few words, beads of sweat had already formed on her forehead.

Richard felt guilty, "Sorry, I was too rough."

"Painkiller." Nina said, each word causing her pain.

Richard often got injured and always kept some painkillers around.

He feels heartbroken seeing Nina in such pain at this moment. He took out a painkiller from the drawer and put it in Nina's mouth.

The taste of the pill spread on her tongue, and Nina found it too bitter to swallow.

Richard got up to get her some water.

When he returned, Nina was leaning against the headboard, her eyes closed, her face still pale.

"Nina, water." Richard sat on the edge of the bed, putting his arm around her shoulders, and Nina leaned weakly against him.

Her forehead pressed against his jaw, the burning temperature shocking Richard.

Nina is running a high fever and has already lost consciousness.

Richard lifted the blanket and picked her up, only to find a large patch of bright red blood on the white sheets.

When Nina woke up, the first thing she saw was the white ceiling of a hospital.

Nearby, she heard voices.

"Richard, how could you be so careless? Don't you know she just had a miscarriage not long ago? She's at her most vulnerable now, how could you bear to put her through this?" Margaret's voice was choked with emotion.

Steven gently tugged at Margaret, signaling her to lower her voice.

Margaret angrily shook him off and voiced to Richard, "We love our daughter very much. Mr. Mille, since you're already married, please don't bother her anymore!"

###chapter 472: No Conclusion

Richard was about to say something when Kelsey suddenly walked past him. "Nina, you're awake."

In an instant, the Jose family surrounded Nina.

"Nina, how are you feeling?"

"Nina, are you feeling any better?"

"Is there anywhere you feel uncomfortable? I'll go get the doctor right away."

Everyone asked anxiously. Richard stood at the foot of the bed, his thin lips pressed together, his eyes filled with deep emotions.

Suddenly, someone patted his shoulder. Richard find it was Seb.

Seb whispered, "Want to go out for a smoke?"

Richard hesitated for a moment, but seeing the current situation, he felt it was inappropriate to stay, so he went out with Seb.

As soon as Richard left, Kelsey asked, "Nina, when did Richard come back? Why didn't you tell us?"

"I don't know either." Nina shook her head gently.

When Richard appeared in front of her last night, she thought she was dreaming. She really didn't know Richard would come back.

Isabella spoke guiltily, "I'm sorry, Nina. I knew Richard was coming back, but I was afraid you'd reject him, so I didn't tell you. I thought that when you met, the misunderstanding would resolve itself. I didn't expect this to happen."

Nina shook her head, "It's not your fault. I knew this day would come sooner or later."

"So, Nina, have you reconciled with Richard?" Isabella spoke cautiously.

Reconciled?

Nina felt an inexplicable urge to laugh at this word.

The rift between her and Richard was irreparable.

In the smoking room.

Seb asked, "How did it come to this?"

Richard glanced at him, feeling a bit irritated, "I don't know either."

Richard had always been self-controlled, but last night he lost it a bit.

In the car, he and Nina made love for almost an hour.

Because of Nina's resistance, he didn't control his strength well and ended up hurting her.

Seb utteered, "I understand. But the Jose family is very resistant to you now because of the child Nina lost."

Richard's brow furrowed deeply, feeling a painful tightness in his chest. He wanted to find a way to release the pent-up frustration, so he asked Seb, "Got a cigarette?"

Seb smiled, "I've quit. Nina and Bella both don't like the smell of smoke. You should quit too."

Richard gritted his teeth, "Seb, you're something else."

Seb was showing off his affection with Bella in front of Richard.

Richard couldn't understand why he had gone to such lengths to help Seb save Isabella back then.

Seb pulled out something, "This is all I have. Want to try it?"

Richard looked closely, "Candy?"

In Seb's palm was a piece of candy wrapped in colorful sugar coating.

"A grown man carrying candy instead of cigarettes?" Richard mocked.

Seb shrugged, "I use it to appease my daughter."

Richard felt even more frustrated.

"If you don't want it, forget it," Seb said, about to put the candy back in his pocket. "I'll save it for my daughter."

"Wait!" Richard said coldly.

After a few seconds of stiffness, Richard reluctantly took the candy.

Seb patted his shoulder, "Don't worry. You helped me, and I won't leave you in the lurch."

Richard rubbed the candy wrapper with his fingers, answering softly, "No need. You live your life. Nina and I will sort things out ourselves."

Around this time, Isabella walked over, interrupting the two men's conversation.

Seb immediately took Isabella's thin shoulders in his hands, "Why did you come out? It's windy by the window."

"Nina doesn't need me right now. I thought I'd go home to make some soup for her," Isabella said, then looked at Richard. "Richard, are you leaving now?"

Richard caught the implication in her words and frowned slightly, "Did Nina ask me to leave?"

"No. It's just that everyone is here with her now, and you haven't rested all night. Why don't you go home for a rest?"

Last night, in the rush to get Nina to the hospital, Richard was still wearing yesterday's clothes, even his shoes were slippers. He looked worn out and exhausted.

Isabella thought, the issues between Richard and Nina are so deeply rooted, it will be hard to resolve quickly.

These things couldn't be rushed. It would be better for Richard to go home and freshen up before coming back. Nina always liked cleanliness, and seeing Richard in a better state might make her feel more comfortable.

But Richard rejected, "No need. You all go home first."

Then Richard, holding the candy Seb gave him, walked towards the hospital room.

"Let's go too." Seb said, pulling Isabella into his arms to shield her from the cold wind coming through the window.

Isabella looked up at Seb, "Do you think Nina can forgive Richard?"

Seb was silent for a moment, then replied, "If they still love each other, then yes."

In the hospital room.

After the doctor said there were no major issues, just needed rest, Margaret's worry finally eased a bit.

"I've prescribed some topical medication. Can someone go to the pharmacy to get it?" The dotor asked.

Kelsey stood up, "I'll go get it." Then she followed the doctor out.

The room was left with just Nina and Margaret.

Margaret sat by the bed, tucking in Nina's blanket and holding her hand, gently stroking it.

Margaret didn't say anything, but her eyes were filled with concern for Nina.

Seeing Margaret's eyes, Nina thought of the pain of losing her child.

In this world, no one cares for you more than your mother.

"Mom, I'm fine," Nina forced a smile.

Nina intended to reassure Margaret, but after she said that, Margaret's face showed even more worry.

"What's going on between you and Richard?" Margaret inquired softly, her brows furrowed.

Nina couldn't answer.

Margaret sighed, "Nina, I'm not trying to interfere. I just think that you and Richard are from different worlds. Your circles, your personalities, your ways of dealing with things, they're completely incompatible with Richard's. I have experience, I know what kind of people are suitable for dating and marriage. I never approved of your relationship with him from the start. This time he hurt you so deeply, I think it's time for me to say something. Nina, have you thought it through? Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone like Richard, living such an unstable life?"

Nina looked up, about to answer, when she caught a glimpse of Richard standing at the door.

Nina paused, then chuckled softly, "Don't worry, Mom. Richard and I won't have a future."

###chapter 473: I Speak Harshly

Margaret was taken aback by Nina's cold response.

Margaret had prepared a lot of persuasive words, thinking it would be hard to convince Nina.

Unexpectedly, before Margaret even started persuading, Nina had already given a resolute answer.

This was quite out of character for Nina.

Before Margaret could think further, there was a sudden thud behind her.

Richard forcefully pushed open the door and strode in.

Before Margaret could react, he had already picked Nina up from the bed and walked out.

By the time Margaret chased after them, Richard was already taking Nina down in the elevator.

There was no one else in the elevator.

Nina only came to her senses after the door closed, "Richard, what are you doing?"

The man didn't speak, his firm jawline tightened, and he seemed colder than usual.

Nina waited for a long time without getting a response. She grabbed his collar, straightened her legs, and tried to break free from him.

Richard probably didn't expect her to do this and was caught off guard, so she actually managed to jump down.

He reacted quickly, almost as soon as Nina's feet touched the ground, he grabbed her arm and pulled her back.

Nina's back hit the elevator wall, the dull sound seemed to shake the entire elevator.

"Let go of me." Nina struggled, but her hands were quickly pinned down by Richard.

"Richard, you bastard, let go of me! Do you hear me?" Nina angrily kicked at him, her knee almost hitting Richard's groin.

Fortunately, Richard dodged in time, bending his long legs forward and spreading Nina's legs apart.

Nina couldn't move now, and she was pinned against the wall by Richard in a very awkward position.

Richard leaned in, his voice hoarse, "You almost made me sterile just now!"

"I don't care if I'm sterile. Aren't you afraid it will affect your happiness for the rest of your life?" He hinted, a teasing smile on his lips.

Nina glared at him, "My happiness for the rest of my life is to never be involved with a bastard like you again!"

Nina's words were hurtful.

Richard's eyes tightened, "Nina, don't say such harsh things to me."

Nina turned her head away, "You're the one who keeps pestering me. I have even harsher words I haven't said yet."

"Oh? Then go ahead, I'd love to hear how harsh you can be."

Nina's chest heaved, holding back her anger, "Richard, there's no way for us. Even if you die in front of me now, I wouldn't blink an eye, let alone shed a tear."

Before she could finish, Richard silenced her with a kiss.

All of Nina's angry and hurtful words were swallowed back by Richard's kiss.

Nina was completely under his control, unable to fight back at all, just being kissed hard by him.

"Ding"

The elevator reached a floor, and the door opened.

Someone outside, carrying a bag of medicine, was about to walk in. As soon as they stepped in, they saw this intense scene and paused.

Nina also saw her, it was Kelsey, who had just gotten the medicine and was about to go upstairs.

Seeing this scene, Nina was mortified.

But she couldn't push Richard away, so she steeled herself and bit down when Richard was off guard.

Richard let out a muffled groan and finally let go of Nina's lips.

At the same time, blood oozed from the corner of his mouth.

He licked his injured lip, and upon noticing Kelsey's presence, he let go of Nina. But as he released her, he clasped her fingers tightly.

One by one, their fingers interlocked.

He probably feared Nina would run, so he held on tightly.

Kelsey came to her senses, her face blushing, "Nina, you guys..."

Nina took a step towards Kelsey, but because Richard was holding her hand, she could only take that one step and stand there, "Kelsey, I'll go up with you."

Richard still didn't let go.

Kelsey said, "Okay."

Nina was still wearing the hospital gown, so Kelsey thought she was just seeing Richard off.

Kelsey pressed the open button, the elevator door opened, but Richard showed no intention of getting out.

Kelsey turned to look, "Richard? Aren't you getting out?"

"Get out! Of course, he has to get out!" Nina used all her strength to move him a bit.

Nina knew that if Richard didn't want to leave, no one could make him.

Were they going to stay stuck here?

Or would Nina be forcibly taken back to the villa?

Nina didn't want to go back with him.

Nina bit her lip, thinking.

Richard was a ruthless person.

The only way to deal with a ruthless person is to be even more ruthless.

If she kept being weak, she would never shake him off.

She didn't want to be entangled, just wanted to end it.

So, Nina had to harden her heart.

If Richard insisted on taking her back, she would have to threaten with her life.

Either she dies, or they die together!

Thinking of this, a resolute look flashed in Nina's eyes.

She looked up and met Richard's gaze, "What exactly do you want to do?"

Her tone was cold.

Nina's tone scared Kelsey a bit.

"Nina." Kelsey called weakly, then stood aside, acting like an invisible person, not daring to ask or say anything more.

Richard silently stared at Nina for a moment, then suddenly let go of her tightly clasped hand.

Nina immediately walked over to Kelsey's side.

Richard lowered his eyes, his voice tinged with helplessness and disappointment, "I'll come see you tomorrow."

Nina wanted to say, you don't need to come.

Not tomorrow, not the day after, not any day in the future.

But Nina was afraid of provoking him.

It was hard to get a moment of peace, she couldn't afford to stir things up again.

Get him to leave first, then deal with the rest.

"I'm leaving." Richard pressed the open button again, gave Nina a deep look, and then walked out.

The elevator door closed again, Kelsey pressed the button to go up, and turned to see Nina looking a bit dazed, "Nina?"

"I'm fine." Nina snapped back, but she still didn't look right.

At night, Zaire and Kelsey stayed to keep watch.

It was already very late.

Nina tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

The hospital room was a luxury suite, Nina and Kelsey slept inside, and Zaire slept on the sofa in the outer living room.

At this hour, Kelsey was already asleep, her light snores echoing in the quiet air.

Nina's mind was about to explode from thinking, and she felt thirsty, so she took a cup to get some water outside.

A wall lamp was on outside, and Zaire was lying on the sofa playing with his phone.

Seeing her come out, Zaire immediately sat up, "Nina, still not asleep?"

"No." Nina nodded, walked past him, and stood there drinking water.

Zaire was texting someone, his phone kept buzzing intermittently.

Nina drank her water and went back to the room. Just as she lay down, a sudden idea struck her.

She sat up again, "I have an idea!"

###chapter 474 Forget

After taking a shower, Richard walked out with his car keys.

Unexpectedly, he saw Michael in the yard.

"Richard, something happened over at Silvercrest!" Michael told Richard anxiously.

Richard's fingers tightened, and a look of conflict crossed his face.

The next morning, before Zaire woke up, Ophelia came to visit Nina with gifts.

Nina was a bit surprised to see her. "Why are you here?"

Ophelia put down the gifts and smiled, "I went to your office to find you, and your assistant told me. Nina, you don't consider me a friend, do you? You were in the hospital and didn't even tell me."

"It's not a big deal." Nina comforted her.

"It's best if it's not a big deal. It's perfectly normal to get a little sick now and then." Ophelia knew her boundaries and didn't press Nina about what exactly was wrong.

The conversation quickly shifted to other topics.

Nina thought about how Richard had crashed into Alvin's car last night. She was too preoccupied to ask about Alvin's condition.

Ophelia's visit was timely, so she took the opportunity to ask.

"Speaking of Alvin, I'm a bit worried. He was supposed to return to Mosterwania today, but somehow he got into a fender bender last night. The car's in the shop, and he's lying at home." Ophelia replied with a sigh.

"Is he okay?" Nina remembered Alvin's face hitting the steering wheel, and when he got up, his face was covered in blood.

Ophelia only had one son, whom she adored. If something serious happened, she would pursue the matter to the very end definitely.

Seeing Nina so worried, Ophelia quickly said, "He's fine, just a little facial injury. Nothing serious. But why are you asking about him?"

Nina bit her lip, voicing, "I need his help with something."

Half an hour later, After leaving the hospital room, Ophelia immediately called Alvin before getting into the elevator.

"Alvin, what's going on between you and Nina?" Ophelia asked as soon as the call was picked up.

Alvin was taken aback. "Mom, what are you talking about?"

"Don't try to hide it from me. I'm your mother! Do you think you can keep secrets from me? Be honest, do you like Nina?" Ophelia's voice was stern.

Alvin scratched his head and stammered, "Mom, don't say that. I don't mind, but she's a girl."

"Stop beating around the bush. Just tell me, do you like her or not?" Ophelia directly interrupted him.

There was a moment of silence before Alvin's resigned voice came through, "This is one-sided; it has nothing to do with her."

"So, it's true?"

"Yes."

Ophelia burst into laughter. "Be honest with me, when did this start? How far have you two gone? Is the reason you won't go back to Mosterwania because you can't leave Nina?"

Alvin was utterly confused. "Mom, I don't understand what you mean."

"Stop pretending. Nina told me everything."

"What did she tell you?"

Even over the phone, Ophelia could sense his tension.

She answered with a smile, "Nina needs you to be her boyfriend for a few days."

There was complete silence on the other end.

Ophelia walked into the elevator, very pleased. "What do you think of me? Do you think I'm so old-fashioned that I can't accept you dating an older woman? I like Nina a lot. If you're dating her, I fully support it! You don't need to worry about me opposing it and using this method to test my reaction!"

"Mom, are you serious? Nina wants me to be her boyfriend?"

"Of course, she just told me."

"Where are you now?" Alvin leapt out of bed, carrying his coat as he dashed out.

"At the hospital," Ophelia asked. "Nina is sick and hospitalized. Didn't you know?"

"I'm on my way." After saying that, Alvin hung up the phone.

Ophelia was a bit puzzled, 'what's going on? Aren't they already dating? How come Alvin doesn't know Nina is sick'.

Ophelia couldn't figure it out and shook her head, deciding not to think about it anymore.

After all, it's a matter for the young people to resolve themselves.

She decided to go pick out some jewelry and other things. Oh, and houses and cars need to be bought too. She had a farm in the countryside, which she planned to give to Nina as an engagement gift. Nina would love it!

Ophelia happily went off to make preparations.

Nina is in the hospital, getting ready to eat the breakfast Margaret specifically brought from home.

Just as she was about to take a bite, the door to the hospital room was suddenly pushed open from the outside.

The noise startled everyone, and they all looked up.

In Nina's mind, only Richard could make such a commotion.

But to her surprise, it was Alvin standing there.

He looked like he had run over, holding his jacket, his cheeks flushed, one hand on the door frame, breathing heavily.

With several pairs of eyes on him, Alvin awkwardly held his breath, which made him choke, turning his face even redder.

"Who is this?" Margaret felt confused as she looked at the person in front of her.

"He's Ms. Murphy's son." Nina introduced.

After catching his breath, Alvin gave Margaret a formal bow and greeted, "Hello, My name is Alvin.

Margaret couldn't help but smile at his flushed face. "I just remembered I left something in the car. Kelsey, come with me to get it." Margaret said, pulling Kelsey out.

As they left, Margaret made sure to close the door.

Kelsey was still confused. "Mom, what did you leave in the car?"

Margaret gave her a light slap. "I didn't leave anything."

"Then why did you say-"

"Can't you see? I'm giving Nina some space. That Alvin likes Nina."

Kelsey blinked. "But Nina already has Richard."

"Richard isn't good enough for Nina," Margaret explained. "I was worried Nina wouldn't let go of Richard and keep entangling with him. Now, with someone suitable around her, maybe she can quickly forget Richard, living a good life."

"Mom, aren't you breaking up a couple?"

"Nonsense! I'm your mother. Would I harm Nina?"

"But-"

"Enough," Margaret interrupted. "Call Zaire and tell him to come home when he's done. I have a task for him."

###chapter 475: Give It Back to Me

In the hospital room, Alvin had been standing the whole time.

After taking a couple of sips of porridge, Nina finally spoke, "Why don't you sit down for a bit?"

With him standing there staring at her, she felt quite embarrassed.

"Okay." Alvin sat down on the stool beside her, his gaze lingering on Nina's face for a moment. "You got hospitalized, why didn't you tell me?"

Nina was taken aback.

Her instinctive reaction was, why should she tell him she was hospitalized?

They weren't that close, were they?

Alvin also realized his slip of the tongue and lowered his head slightly to hide his embarrassment. "I mean, you were fine yesterday, how come you're suddenly in the hospital?"

He still had injuries on his face, small and fine cuts.

Not serious, but they added a certain softness to his handsome and gentle face.

"Is your face okay?" Out of guilt and various complex feelings, Nina had to ask.

"It's fine." Alvin shook his head. At this moment, his gaze on Nina always carried a kind of sparkling emotion.

Nina could understand that look.

She was a few years older than Alvin, but her life experience was much richer.

When Alvin was still carefree and studying, she had already entered the institution of marriage.

Later, she went through a divorce and a series of other hardships.

Given her relationship with Ophelia, in Nina's eyes, Alvin was just a younger friend.

Now, Alvin was looking at her with a very passionate gaze.

Thinking about asking him for that favor later, Nina found it hard to bring up.

Maybe she should ask someone else?

She really couldn't bring herself to ask Alvin.

While Nina was hesitating, Alvin spoke first, "My mom called and asked if I was dating you."

She knew Ophelia would pass on the message, but she didn't expect Ophelia to do it this way.

Alvin smiled, "I said no. You don't like me."

Although he was joking, there was a hint of sadness in his voice.

"Sorry, I didn't know your mom told you that," Nina said. "I actually wanted to ask you for a favor."

As she spoke, Alvin listened attentively.

After she finished, Alvin nodded, "My mom said you wanted to find a boyfriend."

Ophelia's way of passing messages was something she had to admire.

"That's not what I meant. What I really want is-"

"I know. You want to get rid of your ex-boyfriend," Alvin quickly interjected. "The man who took you away that night. I looked into him; his name is Richard. He used to be with the Black Family, and now he's the head of Silvercrest."

"This isn't a big deal; I'm willing to help you."

"Thank you."

Nina was prepared.

She had Alvin stay at the hospital, waiting for Richard to show up.

But she waited all day, and Richard never came.

As night fell, Alvin came in from outside, carrying some freshly bought pastries.

When he opened the door, Nina was just getting out of bed, supporting her waist. One foot had just touched the shoe when the sound of the door startled her.

Probably because her mind had been tense all day, thinking about when Richard would come. Her nerves had been on edge all day, and when someone suddenly pushed the door open, she instinctively thought it was Richard.

Her other foot slipped and landed on the floor.

The cold touch made her pause slightly, but she couldn't care about her dirty foot at the moment and quickly looked up towards the door.

A tall figure came into view, and the man had already walked over, placing the pastries down and squatting in front of her.

Then, Nina felt a warmth on her ankle. She looked down in surprise and saw Alvin holding her calf with one hand, lifting her foot off the ground, and using his other hand to pat her sole.

Nina was startled and was about to pull her foot back when she heard a light scoff from the door.

"Michael?"

Michael stood at the door with his arms crossed, his gaze sweeping over Alvin with a mocking smile on his face. "Nina, doing this, are you being fair to Richard?"

Nina's heart tightened, "Michael, between Richard and me, it's best not to talk about who owes whom. Even he has no right to question me, let alone you."

"Right." Michael nodded, "Richard made sacrifices for Isabella and Seb, and you don't mention any of it. You only remember the child that died in your womb, right? Do you know what Richard is facing now? He overcame all obstacles to come back from Silvercrest for Isabella's wedding. And this is how you repay him. Nina, I've seen countless heartless people in my life, but someone as heartless as you, this is a first."

Nina's eyes reddened, "I've never seen someone who claims to want a child but kills their own child with their own hands!"

Michael frowned, feeling that talking to Nina was pointless.

A heartless woman like Nina didn't deserve to stand by Richard's side.

"Whatever." Michael threw out a sentence and glanced at Alvin, "I wish you two a lifetime together."

"Thank you," Alvin said.

Nina turned her face away, not saying a word.

Michael turned and left with big strides.

He was here on Richard's orders to inform Nina that he had returned to Silvercrest.

But now, it seemed unnecessary.

Standing at the elevator, Michael took out a pack of cigarettes, pulled one out, and put it in his mouth. The lighter made a "pop" sound as it ignited, and the elevator doors opened at the same time.

"Smoking is prohibited in the hospital, don't you know?" Kelsey came up and snatched the lighter away.

Michael, already fuming, saw Kelsey's action as hitting the bullseye.

He narrowed his eyes and stared coldly at Kelsey, "Give it back."

"Not unless you promise not to smoke in the hospital."

Michael laughed in anger, "What business is it of yours?"

"This is a hospital, a public place. The people here are patients, and smoking is bad for them," Kelsey said righteously.

Michael's face grew colder, "I'll say it once, give it back!"

Kelsey was a bit scared of him.

Especially when Michael had a stern face, he was indeed intimidating.

He was different from Richard.

Richard had a kind of deep-seated ferocity, while Michael wore everything on his face.

For instance, at this moment, his face showed an expression as if he wanted to eat someone.

Kelsey took a step back, her tone softer than before, "Michael, out of respect for Nina, I won't argue with you. But you can't smoke here. If you promise to smoke outside, I won't care. Even if you smoke a hundred or a thousand cigarettes, I won't care."

"Heh." Michael sneered, suddenly stepping forward and stepping on Kelsey's toe.

###chapter 476: Come, Look at the Camera

"What are you doing?" Kelsey jumped back and screamed.

Michael didn't retreat; instead, he advanced step by step, cornering Kelsey.

"Michael!" Kelsey extended her hands to push him away, her palms pressing against his chest. The muscles under his shirt were taut and slightly bulging, giving Kelsey the illusion of pushing against a rock.

Kelsey pushed for a long time without moving him an inch. Michael almost had her pinned against the wall. If it weren't for her raised arms between them, their bodies would have been pressed tightly together.

Kelsey blushed furiously. At that moment, a few people walked out of the elevator, glancing at her and Michael. As they walked away, she could hear their low, teasing laughter.

Michael looked down at her and chuckled, "Kelsey, do you want to control me so badly? Do you want to be my girlfriend?"

Kelsey wanted to punch him, her face red as she retorted, "Who wants to be your girlfriend? Jack is a hundred times better than you. No, a thousand times!"

Michael wasn't angry; he kept smiling, "Does Jack know you like to meddle so much?"

"This isn't meddling. It's everyone's duty to eliminate harm for the people!" Kelsey shouted.

Michael opened his phone suddenly, then said to her, "Come on, look at the camera."

Kelsey turned her head instinctively, only to find that she and Michael had been captured in a photo in the phone's gallery.

Michael took down his phone and admired the photo, "Nice, this angle makes it look like we're making love."

Kelsey saw a bit of the photo and tried to grab the phone, but Michael was prepared and held it above her head.

He held it effortlessly, and Kelsey couldn't reach it no matter what.

"Michael!" Kelsey was genuinely furious.

Michael's dark eyes reflected Kelsey's embarrassed and angry look, like a teased little bunny, both pitiful and adorable, making his heart itch with affection.

Just a bit fierce.

Kelsey didn't have the tenderness and sweetness of women in adult entertainment venues, but somehow, she could easily captivate Michael's heart.

Kelsey threw the lighter on the ground, the crisp sound bringing Michael back to his senses.

When Michael looked again, he saw Kelsey's eyes were red, tears welling up, "Take it back! Get lost!"

Michael paused, "You should have done this earlier."

He took a step back, and Kelsey slapped Michael across the face.

Michael's head tilted to the left from the force of her slap. Even someone as tough-skinned as Michael had a rapidly reddening cheek.

"Scumbag!" Kelsey cursed, crying as she ran into the elevator.

Michael didn't chase after Kelsey.

He stood there, rubbing his thumb in frustration, then picked up the lighter.

The lighter was made of a rare material, coated with a layer of paint, a very vintage style, with noticeable paint chipping on the body.

Kelsey's forceful throw had chipped a corner, and Michael's fingers brushed over the sharp edge, his brow furrowing.

As soon as Kelsey exited the elevator, she bumped into Jack.

Jack was carrying some fruit, having just gotten off work to visit Nina.

"Kelsey, what's wrong?" Seeing her face full of tears, Jack felt concerned, "Who bullied you?"

Kelsey almost blurted out everything that had just happened, but Michael's face suddenly flashed in her mind.

Jack was a decent guy, unlike Michael, who was involved in shady dealings.

If it came to a head-to-head confrontation, Jack wouldn't be a match for Michael.

After weighing it in her mind, Kelsey decided not to tell Jack. She didn't want Jack to get angry and stand up for her, only to get himself into trouble.

"Who is it? Tell me." Jack grabbed her arm, pulling her closer to him, looking down at her.

Jack seemed to be waiting for Kelsey to say the name, ready to confront that person without hesitation!

At that moment, the elevator across the way arrived on the first floor.

Kelsey saw Michael walking out with his hands in his pockets.

Since they were face to face, Michael also saw her and Jack.

But Michael just glanced at them indifferently, showing no intention of greeting them.

Thinking about what had just happened, Kelsey instinctively hid behind Jack, biting her lip.

Jack turned to her, "What's wrong?"

Kelsey shook her head.

Kelsey only relaxed when she saw Michael walk away, further solidifying her decision not to tell Jack about it!

But Jack wasn't a fool; he noticed Kelsey's reaction and asked again, "Did Michael bully you?"

"No! Absolutely not!" Kelsey answered quickly, almost as if she was rushing to respond.

Jack looked at her quietly.

Afraid of being found out, Kelsey forced a smile, "How could he dare bully me? I just twisted my ankle while walking."

Jack still didn't say anything, just looked at her, seemingly still doubtful of her words.

"Really." To quickly move past this, Kelsey resorted to her trump card, acting cute, "My foot hurts so much, I can hardly walk. Can you help me out?"

"Okay." Jack nodded, then turned his back to her, bending slightly, "Hop on, I'll carry you."

Kelsey smiled sweetly, as if the earlier shadow had been dispelled.

She obediently climbed onto Jack's back, wrapping her arms around his neck, "I think I've gained a few pounds recently. I wonder if you can still carry me."

Jack's laughter came from ahead, "Even if you were as round as a ball, I could still carry you."

"Nonsense! How could I get as round as a ball? I would never allow myself to get that fat!"

Michael sat in his car, not driving away immediately.

From a distance, he saw Jack carrying Kelsey out, confirming his suspicion.

It seemed Michael had really hurt her.

Michael had only intended to tease her, but after running into Nina and Alvin, he was already angry and hadn't controlled his strength, accidentally stepping on Kelsey's foot.

He wondered how badly Kelsey was hurt.

Feeling restless, Michael opened the glove compartment, rummaging through it but finding nothing.

At that moment, Jack's car slowly drove past him.

The car's interior light was on, and he could clearly see Kelsey's smiling, happy face.

Only after the car had completely driven away did Michael let out a self-mocking laugh and shut the glove compartment door with a snap.

Kelsey had a boyfriend. Why was he feeling sorry for her?

'Michael, it's bad enough that you're pathetic, but now your character is becoming despicable too?' Michael joked self-deprecatingly.

###chapter 477: "Do you really not want me anymore?"

The Jose family.

When Zaire walked in with his coat, Margaret and Steven were sitting on the living room sofa, both pairs of eyes immediately turning to look at Zaire.

"Dad, Mom, what's so urgent that you called me back?" Zaire walked over, slumped into the sofa, looking a bit tired.

He had been very tired recently because of the issues with Isabella and Seb.

Now that Isabella and Seb were finally settled, he had to face a pile of company issues while stepping back from their matters.

Zaire was practically going crazy with busyness.

As soon as he got Margaret and Steven's call, he rushed back.

Margaret asked, "You have Richard's contact information, right?"

"Yeah, I do. What's up?"

"Tell him not to bother Nina anymore." Margaret, usually gentle, was rarely serious.

Zaire didn't take it seriously, "Mom, that's between Nina and Richard. Even if you oppose it, it won't help. Neither Nina nor Richard seems like someone who would listen to you."

"I'm not arranging things for Nina; I respect her choices. Just tell Richard that Nina has a boyfriend now and stop bothering Nina. Don't make it look like Nina is dating two men at the same time."

Zaire, seeing her seriousness, believed her a bit, "Nina has a boyfriend? Who?"

"Alvin."

"Alvin?" Zaire laughed, "He's not good enough for Nina."

Margaret glared at him, "Nonsense! I think Alvin is quite good, well-mannered, and studied abroad. Very suitable."

"Mom, you don't know how wild people can get when they study abroad."

"I trust my judgment!" Margaret was very insistent.

Zaire felt he couldn't reason with Margaret, so he shifted his focus to Steven, "Dad, what do you think?"

Steven first glanced at Margaret, then held Margaret's hand and answered, "Stop nagging. Do what your mom says. I trust Margaret's judgment."

Zaire was speechless.

"Are you going to make the call or not?" Margaret was getting anxious, "If you don't want to call, give me the number, and I'll call him myself."

Zaire had to compromise, "I'll call Richard."

With that, he headed upstairs.

Margaret stopped him, "Where are you going?"

"I'm going upstairs to call Richard."

"No, you call Richard right here."

Zaire was helpless, "Mom, don't you trust me? From childhood to now, which of your requests have I not fulfilled? Since I promised to call Richard, I will definitely convey your message."

Seeing Zaire's tired face, Margaret had to relent, "Alright then, I'll leave it to you. Don't forget!"

Zaire smiled knowingly, "Don't worry."

After returning to his room, Zaire called Richard.

He relayed Margaret's words verbatim.

Richard on the other end commented, "Nina won't fall for Alvin."

Zaire laughed, "Confidence is good, but overconfidence is bad. Richard, you'd better come back. Settle things before you leave."

"I'm too busy here, can't get away for now."

Zaire frowned, "I understand."

A man's career ambition is quite similar.

Especially for someone like Richard, who had reached a certain height, it wasn't a matter of doing or not doing as he pleased.

"Thanks for telling me this." Richard spoke, "And please, when you have time, take care of Nina for me."

"I will."

After hanging up, Richard leaned back in his large chair. He hadn't rested for two minutes when his assistant came in, "Richard, there's a problem."

Nina had been in the hospital for three days.

To cooperate with her act, Alvin came every day, sometimes staying the whole day without getting bored.

When Margaret and the others were around, he quietly looked at his phone.

When no one was around, he would chat with Nina about daily topics.

He talked a lot about interesting things that happened while he was studying abroad, but Nina mostly couldn't keep up with the conversation. Not wanting to interrupt him, she just patiently listened.

But actually, she easily forgot the topics Alvin talked about. Sometimes, even while Alvin was enthusiastically talking, she would start zoning out just sitting there.

Nina had been waiting for Richard to come.

But in these three days, Richard hadn't shown up once.

Probably knowing the hurt in Nina's heart, her family never brought up Richard in front of her.

Even Isabella stopped mentioning Richard.

Nina had been annoyed by their constant mention of Richard. She knew everything Richard did was to help Isabella and Seb.

But as her child was lost because of Richard, Nina still couldn't get over that in her heart.

Now, no one mentions Richard anymore, as if he has completely vanished from her world, which makes Nina feel uneasy.

After completing the discharge procedures, Isabella and Seb were already at home.

When they were talking, Nina kept staring at Isabella.

Finally, Isabella couldn't take it anymore and asked with a smile, "Nina, what's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?"

"Bella, are you hiding something from me?" Nina couldn't hold back any longer.

Isabella blinked, "No, Nina, what's wrong?"

In front of others, Nina might still be able to endure it.

But Isabella had grown up with her, sharing secrets under the same blanket many times.

At this moment, Nina couldn't hold it in anymore, "I want to know, where did Richard go?"

"He went back to Silvercrest."

"When did he go back?"

"The second day after you were admitted to the hospital."

Nina exhaled, her eyes stinging with tears.

Isabella explained, "Nina, we know you're dating Alvin now, and we don't want you to reconcile with Richard, so we haven't mentioned him."

Isabella observed Nina's expression as she spoke, "You won't forgive Richard for the rest of your life, right?"

Nina didn't respond.

At first, Nina was very angry, so angry that she could stab Richard. Now that Nina had calmed down, her feelings were complicated.

Isabella seized the opportunity, "Nina, you still love Richard, don't you? You can't let him go, can you?"

"No." Nina shook her head, "He killed my child. We can never be together."

"Nina." Isabella wanted to persuade her further, but Nina had already closed her eyes, "I'm tired and want to rest. Please leave."

Nina lay awake all night.

Early the next morning, before she got up, Alvin arrived.

When Nina came downstairs, Alvin was watering the flowers with her father.

Alvin was telling Steven about a rare flower he encountered while hiking abroad.

Alvin said the flower could bloom in seven different colors within a day, stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately, its blooming period was short. At sunset, after displaying its final color, the flower would wither with the night. By the next day, the roots would completely rot, leaving nothing behind, as if it had never existed.

Steven was fascinated, "Do you have any photos?"

Alvin shook his head, "The flower is very rare. It was my first encounter, and I planned to photograph its entire blooming process the next day, but when I returned, only the rotting roots were left."

"I see." Steven looked regretful.

Alvin hastened to add, "Don't worry. I'll look for it again when I go back. If I find it, I'll definitely take pictures for you."

Steven nodded, looking at Alvin with a bit more appreciation, "That would be great."

"It's no trouble. I've always wanted to see that seven-colored flower again."

Both turned and saw Nina.

Steven put down the watering can, "I'll go wash my hands. Nina, you keep Alvin company."

Steven was creating some alone time for them.

After Steven left, Alvin's gaze slowly fell on Nina's face. After a concerned look, he asked softly, "Did you sleep well last night?"

Nina hadsaw the dark circles under her eyes in the mirror. Without some light makeup, she wouldn't have dared to come out.

She didn't answer Alvin's question but questioned, "Is the seven-colored flower you mentioned real?"

"It's real," Alvin replied, "I know it sounds unbelievable. Even my classmates didn't believe me when I told them. It's normal for you to doubt it. If someone else had told me, I would have thought they were crazy too."

Nina shook her head, "No. I believe you."

Alvin was taken aback.

Nina continued, "When are you going back to Mosterwania?"

"I have a flight in three days." Alvin looked at her, wanting to say something but hesitating.

"Okay." Nina nodded, "I'll go with you."

Alvin was stunned again, his expression a mix of surprise and joy, and a bit of disbelief.

Nina smiled, "You've told me so much about that place these past few days. I want to see it for myself, including the seven-colored flower."

Alvin's heart pounded, his cheeks flushing slightly with excitement. His breathing quickened, but he finally managed a shy smile.

Seeing Alvin's bashful smile, Nina also smiled.

Maybe she really should go out and see the world.

She couldn't confine herself to romantic entanglements; it would ruin her.

Three days later, Nina and Alvin boarded a plane to Mosterwania.

Since Alvin had booked his ticket first and Nina bought hers later, their seats were a bit apart.

After boarding, Nina noticed that the seats around her were empty.

Alvin felt confused, "How odd, why are there so few passengers in first class today? It's empty over there too."

Nina thought, maybe they haven't boarded yet.

However, after waiting for more than ten minutes, no one else came.

Just as she started to feel something was off, the flight attendant's announcement came over the intercom.

The announcement indicated that the cabin doors were about to close and the plane was preparing for takeoff.

Alvin also found it strange but felt fortunate. He stopped a passing flight attendant and sincerely requested, "Excuse me, my seat is in the last row. I see there aren't many passengers in first class. Can I switch seats to sit with my friend?"

After patiently listening to his request, the flight attendant shook her head, "Sir, you'll need to ask Mr. Mille about that."

"Mr. Mille?" Alvin followed the flight attendant's gaze and saw a tall, imposing figure approaching.

It was none other than Richard.

Richard walked over, his cold gaze sweeping across Alvin's face, "You're in the way."

Richard's presence was so overwhelming that, despite Alvin's reluctance, his feet instinctively stepped aside.

By the time Alvin realized it, Richard had already taken his seat.

Alvin looked at Nina with concern, worried she might be bullied, and finally mustered the courage to speak, "Mr. Mille, can I switch seats with you?"

Richard didn't even lift his head but turned to Nina and asked, "Do you want to sit with him?"

Seeing him here had already left Nina stunned. His question left her at a loss for words.

"Mr. Mille, Nina is dating me now. If you are a gentleman, please don't disturb us anymore. Moreover, a true gentleman would understand the importance of letting others be happy. I believe someone like Mr. Mille wouldn't stoop to argue with ordinary people like us." Alvin knew how to use words skillfully.

Given Richard's current status, he indeed shouldn't stoop to such actions.

But Richard chuckled and finally looked at Alvin, "Didn't Nina tell you? I've never been a gentleman. And I hate letting others be happy."

The flight attendant approached Alvin, "The plane is about to take off. Please return to your seat."

"Take off?" Alvin looked around, noticing there were no other passengers.

The entire first-class cabin had only the three of them.

He asked the flight attendant, "Where are the other passengers?"

The flight attendant explained with a smile, "Mr. Mille has booked the entire first-class cabin for this flight."

Alvin knew Richard did this on purpose.

Alvin had no choice but to say to Nina, "If you need anything, just call me. I'll come over quickly."

Finally, Alvin gave Richard a wary look before turning to leave.

There was some turbulence during the flight.

Nina leaned back in her seat, her hands resting on the armrests.

To avoid eye contact with Richard, she turned to look out the window.

Suddenly, she felt a tight grip on her hand. A warm palm covered hers, enveloping her entire hand.

Before Nina could react, he had already tightly grasped her hand.

The force was domineering and unreasonable, making it impossible for Nina to break free.

Nina had no choice but to turn to Richard, only to meet Richard's deeply emotional and sorrowful eyes.

"Do you really not want me anymore?" Richard whispered.

His tone was so soft that it was almost unreasonable. Nina felt as if something had struck her chest, bringing a dull ache.

"Richard, let go."

"I won't." Richard continued to look at her with pitiful eyes, completely different from the cold and aloof demeanor he had shown Alvin earlier. It was as if he could be a powerful figure in front of anyone else, but in front of her, he was just Richard, an ordinary man.

"I'm afraid if I let go, you'll really go to hold that gigolo's hands."

"His name is Alvin, not gigolo."

"I see him as a gigolo."

By now, the plane had stabilized above the clouds. Richard's grip on her hand loosened slightly but still didn't let go, "Nowadays, young people all want to take shortcuts or rely on women. Nina, you can't possibly like someone like that, right?"

"Who says I don't?" Nina instinctively retorted, after realizing his words were all wrong, she corrected, "Alvin is not a gigolo. He's Nathaniel's son. If anything, it's not clear who is relying on whom."

"If you want to rely on someone, you can come to me. You can rely on me anytime, anywhere." Richard spoke softly.

Nina calmly voiced, "Richard, stop talking nonsense. We've broken up. I admit my previous attitude was a bit extreme. I've calmed down and re-evaluated our relationship. Call me pretentious or weak, but you should know how important that child was to me. The child is gone, and so is our past."

Mentioning the child, Richard was silent for a few seconds.

"I have nothing to say about the child. Hate me or blame me, I will never let go of your hand. I said, for the rest of your life, you can only belong to me."

Nina smiled helplessly, "Why are you so stubborn?"

Richard replied, "Since you know I'm stubborn, you should know what I'll do. Stay away from that gigolo, or I can't guarantee I won't send him to meet his maker."

After this conversation, Richard closed his eyes for a rest.

Once the plane stabilized, Alvin came to check on Nina once, but with Richard there, he only said a few words before leaving.

After that, Alvin didn't appear again.

Even when the plane landed, Nina didn't see Alvin.

Her hand had been held by Richard the entire flight, making her arm feel like it was being gnawed by ants, an uncomfortable sensation whenever she moved.

When Nina stood up, she realized the cabin was empty, and even Alvin was gone.

After getting off the plane, Nina still didn't see Alvin.

Feeling worried, Nina took out her phone to call Alvin, only to find his phone was off.

Remembering Richard's earlier words, Nina's heart sank, and she quickly asked him, "What did you do to Alvin?"

Richard glanced at her nonchalantly and replied just as nonchalantly, "I threw him off halfway. If he's lucky, he should still be in the Atlantic Ocean."

This kind of talk might scare children, but Nina knew that while Richard could be ruthless, he wouldn't go as far as throwing Alvin off the plane.

However, one thing was certain: Alvin's sudden disappearance was Richard's doing.

For the next three days, Richard stayed with Nina at a hotel.

The hotel was on an island with picturesque scenery.

At first, Nina was worried Richard might force her into something.

Richard was very proper this time.

NBut it turned out not only did Richard not touch her, but he was also very polite to her every day.

He didn't seem busy either, leisurely staying at the hotel with her, eating three meals a day on time, and receiving no more than three calls a day.

The idle time was particularly healing for the heart and made one forget about time.

Thus, Nina and Richard unknowingly stayed at the hotel for three days.

Until one afternoon, Alvin suddenly appeared in front of her.

Nina had just returned from the restaurant when Alvin suddenly emerged from behind the curtains, startling her.

Before Nina could react, Alvin strode forward to hug her.

"It's so good to see you." Alvin seemed a bit emotional. After a brief hug, he grabbed her arm, "Come with me."

Nina took a few steps with him before hearing a knock on the door behind her.

Richard's voice followed from outside, "Nina, are you ready?"

With pupils contracted, Alvin pulled Nina to run out.

Nina was on the first floor, with the balcony leading directly to the beach.

When Richard entered, he saw the two of them jumping over the balcony railing.

Richard rushed over but couldn't even grab a piece of Nina's clothing, punching the railing in frustration, "Nina, come back!"

But Nina didn't look back and followed Alvin.

Richard was left standing alone on the balcony, his face dark and stormy.

A subordinate, hearing the commotion, came in and, seeing Richard unharmed, quietly sighed in relief. Noticing the two figures running away, he seemed to understand, "I'll take some men to chase them."

He was about to climb over the railing but was stopped by Richard.

"No need."

Nina and Alvin set off to find the seven-colored flower.

As they left, Nina made a promise to herself.

If she really saw the seven-colored flower, she would reconcile with Richard.

Nina looked up at the sky, "Richard, let's leave it to fate."

On the seventh day of their mountain trek, Richard encountered an assassination attempt.

As night fell, Alvin set up two tents, and they took out their remaining food, sitting under the starry sky to eat.

"This is our last bit of food," Alvin said, "This trip doesn't seem to be going well."

They had been searching for seven days in a sparsely populated area, encountering many rare plants along the way.

But they still hadn't found the seven-colored flower Alvin had mentioned.

They had only brought ten days' worth of food, and according to their plan, today was the last day. Tomorrow, they should start heading back.

Alvin was reluctant but had to ask Nina's opinion, "Tomorrow, should we keep going forward or head back?"

Nina took a bite of her bread and decided, "I want to go forward for one more day."

Alvin smiled, "That's what I was thinking too. Let's search for one more day tomorrow!"

"Okay."

After eating, After taking a few photos of the starry sky,Â Nina then crawled into her tent to lie down.

The past few days of trekking had left her no time to think about those messy things, and the clutter in her mind seemed to be gradually clearing, making her feel lighter.

These past few nights had been the best sleep she'd had since separating from Richard.

However, tonight she couldn't sleep.

When she finally did fall asleep, she dreamed of Richard.

In the dream, Richard was dressed in black, appearing before her.

Suddenly, someone appeared behind him, raising a knife and stabbing it into his back.

###chapter 478 Reconciliation

"Ah!" Nina woke up with a start.

She sat up in the pitch-black tent, surrounded by darkness. In the overly silent environment, her heartbeat pounded like a drum in her chest.

The nightmare she just had was bloody. Even though Nina knew she was dreaming, she was still drenched in sweat from fear.

Suddenly, Alvin's voice came from outside the tent, "Nina, are you okay?"

"I'm fine." Nina calmed herself a bit before crawling out from the tent.

The temperature on the mountain dropped like winter in the latter half of the night. Wrapped in a thin blanket, Nina still felt the cold seeping in from all directions.

Alvin handed her a thermos, observing her face in the night, "Did you have a nightmare?"

Warm water slid down Nina's throat. Hearing Alvin's question, she recalled the nightmare, "Yes."

Nina found a rock to sit on, staring into the night, her mind completely blank.

She had been trying so hard not to think about Richard. She even felt she was doing well these past few days. So why did she still dream about him? And such a bloody dream!

"Seven-colored flower!" Alvin's voice came from beside her, filled with immense joy.

Nina was stunned for a moment, then quickly walked towards Alvin.

Sure enough, in a crack in a rock, a vibrant flower was blooming.

When Nina arrived, the flower was still a pale white, but within seconds, the petals began to deepen in color.

Alvin excitedly took out his camera for snapping pictures from various angles.

"I missed it last time. I can't miss its bloom this time."

Alvin noticed the silence behind him,Â seeing Nina staring blankly at the flower, lost in thought.

Just as Alvin was about to speak, a sudden wind rose, and several men in black appeared out of nowhere, surrounding him and Nina.

Seeing these men, Alvin's first reaction was to protect Nina.

But Nina recognized the leader as one of Richard's men.

She had seen him come to discuss matters with Richard several times during her stay at the hotel.

Seeing him here now, Nina didn't need to guess whose orders he was following.

The man walked over to Nina and pleased, "Nina, Richard is injured and in critical condition. Can you come back with me to see him one last time?"

'Injured, critical condition, one last time!'

Each word felt like a stab to Nina's heart.

Her nightmare had come true!

When Nina rushed back to the hotel, the hallway was filled with people.

A crowd stood there, but it was silent. The entire hallway was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

As Nina approached, a doctor came out, his expression extremely grave.

Nina grabbed him and asked in hurry, "How is Richard?"

The doctor met her eyes briefly, then quickly looked away, sighed, and shook his head, "I did my best."

Nina felt like her heart had been torn open, the pain suffocating.

The door in front of her opened, then Nina dragged her heavy feet inside.

There were still a few people inside, not as many as outside, mostly Richard's close associates.

A person lay on the bed, but at this moment, his face was covered by a sheet, lifeless.

Blood-stained cloth and cotton balls were scattered on the floor, the blood almost dried.

Nina walked to the bedside, her knees suddenly weak, and she collapsed.

She grabbed the hand hanging off the bed, holding it tightly, "Richard, you haven't even asked for my forgiveness yet. How can you die?"

She trembled as she lifted the sheet, revealing Richard's pale, bloodless face. Tears burst forth uncontrollably.

Nina lay by the bed, crying her heart out.

"Richard, you bastard! You broke your promise! You said you would make it up to me! I haven't even forgiven you yet. How can you die first? Come back to life! I want you to come back to life!"

Nina cried desperately, not noticing that everyone else had quietly left the room. And Richard, lying on the bed, had opened his eyes at some point.

It wasn't until a hand gently touched her head that Nina paused, lifting her tear-filled eyes to see Richard smiling at her through the blur.

Nina quickly wiped her tears with her sleeve. It was clear now, not an illusion; Richard was really smiling at her.

Nina, still sniffling, thought she was seeing things.

"You're so sad that I died?" Richard's hoarse voice reached her ears.

Nina finally realized she had been tricked by Richard!

She said nothing and got up to leave.

"Nina!" Richard hurriedly sat up, but something pulled at his wound, making him grimace in pain.

Nina turned back to see a large bloodstain spreading on his abdomen.

Seeing the blood, Nina knew Richard was seriously injured.

Panic surged in her heart as she bent down to lift his shirt, "Let me see."

Richard grabbed her hand, his face pale, but he forced a smile, "Why are you lifting my shirt now?"

"I'm not in the mood for jokes," Nina said, "Let me see your wound."

"You're not a doctor."

"I want to see!"

Richard finally loosened his grip.

As the shirt lifted, Nina saw the wound on his body.

A long, deep gash, already stitched up, but still oozing blood.

Seeing Richard's pale face and the veins bulging on his forehead, Nina knew he was in great pain.

"How did you get hurt like this?" Nina's voice trembled.

It seemed Richard's men hadn't completely lied to her. Before she returned, Richard had indeed been on the brink of death.

Nina felt a wave of relief. If Richard had really died, she wouldn't know what to do.

Richard, however, smiled at her, saying lightly, "It's nothing."

"This is nothing? You're lucky!" Nina's eyes reddened.

If Richard hadn't been lucky, he would have met his maker by now.

She was frantic, but Richard was still smiling, as if the wound wasn't on him but on someone else.

"You're still smiling!" Nina, exasperated, punched his shoulder.

But Richard cried out in pain, large beads of sweat forming on his forehead with his face paling even more.

Nina quickly reached out to support him, lifting his shirt to see another wound on his shoulder.

Although not as frightening as the wound on his abdomen, the white bandages wrapped around his shoulder were still soaked with blood, making Nina's heart ache.

Nina dared not touch him recklessly again. "How many more injuries do you have?"

Richard pulled her close, soothing her gently, "It's nothing. I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm not just lucky; I have thick skin. These little wounds can't hurt me."

Nina knew he was trying to comfort her. He was someone who could endure pain, yet he couldn't help but cry out earlier.

"Alright, you should lie down quickly and avoid pulling at your wounds again."

Richard wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her into his embrace and lying down together, "Lie down with me."

Because of what happened earlier, Nina didn't dare push him away and just lay there with him.

Before long, they both fell asleep.

Nina took care of Richard at the hotel for two days, so his injuries gradually improved.

One day, while they were eating, a subordinate came in to report that Alvin was looking for Nina and was waiting in the hotel lobby.

Nina put down her fork, "I'll go see him."

As she stood up, Richard grabbed her arm, his face stern, "Don't go."

"Alvin might need something. Besides, I left him on the mountain that day, which wasn't right." Nina explained.

Richard, still frowning, stood up, "I'll go with you."

"No! You're just getting better, and the doctor repeatedly warned you not to move around." Nina could sense Richard's tension and anxiety. To reassure him, she kissed his cheek, "I'll be back soon."

The kiss immediately softened the coldness in Richard's eyes.

"I'll wait for you to finish eating." Richard let go of her hand.

In the hotel lobby, Nina met Alvin.

To her surprise, Alvin was still wearing his hiking clothes, and even his backpack hadn't changed. His pants and backpack were still muddy.

Alvin looked disheveled, and worn out.

But when he saw Nina, he still flashed a bright smile and walked towards her.

Before Nina could speak, he said, "I brought back the seven-colored flower."

Nina was stunned, "Brought it back? Didn't you say it only blooms for one night?"

They had been in the mountains for seven days, and it would take at least three days to return unless, like her, Alvin had been flown back by Richard's men in a helicopter.

Even so, the seven-colored flower should have withered by now.

Alvin took out a long from his backpack, transparent cylindrical container with the seven-colored flower inside.

At that moment, the petals were transitioning between two colors, with one half red and the other half pink, and the middle part a different color.

"This is its final color transition. I dug it out with its roots and soaked it in chemicals for three hours, preserving its color at this moment forever." Alvin's expression was proud, with a hint of anticipation.

Like a child who had done well and was waiting for praise, Alvin eagerly awaited Nina's amazed reaction and genuine compliments.

Nina was indeed amazed. After hearing Alvin's explanation, she was stunned again, "Is it a specimen now?"

"You could say that."

Nina felt a bit sad, "It's a pity."

"What?" Alvin didn't quite catch it.

Nina shook her head, "Nothing. You did a great job. Congratulations on finally having it."

Alvin had previously mentioned that his biggest regret was not being able to keep the seven-colored flower. If he ever saw it again, he hoped to find a way to keep it forever.

Now, he had done it.

Nina was genuinely happy for him.

Alvin handed her the container with the seven-colored flower, his face slightly flushed, "Nina, before we set out, I made a wish. If I could see the seven-colored flower again and successfully bring it back, I would confess to the person I like."

Before she could say anything, Alvin pulled out a diamond ring and knelt on one knee in front of her, "Nina, I like you. From the moment I first saw you, I liked you. But for various reasons, I never had the courage to say it. Will you be my girlfriend? Will you marry me?"

This sudden scene left Nina stunned.

A few passersby had gathered around, clapping and cheering, "Say yes."

Nina didn't want to hurt Alvin, but..."I'm sorry, Alvin. I can't accept your confession."

Alvin was stunned.

Nina explained, "Before we set out, I also made a wish. If I saw the seven-colored flower, I would forgive Richard."

Alvin's expression froze.

"To be honest, I didn't believe in the existence of the seven-colored flower. I just wanted to give myself a reason to let go completely, leaving the decision to fate. But I didn't expect that we would actually find it."

Alvin's face darkened, and he looked at the flower in the container with despair, "If we hadn't found the seven-colored flower, would you really have left him?"

Nina shook her head, "I don't think I could."

The seven-colored flower was just an excuse. In reality, she had already made up her mind when they set out to find it.

She couldn't let go of Richard.

She loved this man deeply.

So even after seven days of searching without finding the flower, she still planned to go on for another day.

She never had much hope of finding the seven-colored flower. She just wanted to delay for another day, to give herself more time to think.

And it was at that moment that Richard's men found her.

When she learned that Richard was in critical condition, Nina had no more doubts in her heart.

She realized she could never sever ties with Richard in this lifetime.

Alvin looked heartbroken.

Nina said, "I've always seen you as a friend, Alvin. You're a great guy, and you'll find someone special in the future."

Retrieving the ring, he stood up to ask Nina, "Can I hug you?"

Nina gave him a heartfelt hug.

Alvin walked out of the hotel lobby, got into his car, and leaned back in the seat, feeling lost.

Suddenly, his phone rang. He answered it casually.

"Hey, Alvin, how did it go? Did you succeed in confessing? Let me guess. I bet the girl was really moved when she saw the flower. You're so clever, thinking of using the cultivated seven-colored flower to trick her into going camping. By the way, I deserve the most credit for this, right? I risked getting fired to steal that sample from the lab for you! So, how do you plan to thank me?"

###chapter 479: The Grand Finale

The person on the other end of the phone was very noisy, but it was relatively quiet on Alvin's side.

A few seconds later, Alvin hung up the phone.

He looked down at the seven-colored flower specimen in his hand with a self-mocking smile.

Who would have thought that the thing he had painstakingly obtained would ultimately benefit Richard?

Alvin sped all the way to the beach.

He threw the precious seven-colored flower specimen into the sea.

He watched as the waves pushed the bottle away, and then it slowly sank into the sea. Only then did Alvin turn to leave.

The news of Nina and Richard reconciling reached Lakina.

Isabella and the Jose family were all happy for the two of them.

Although Margaret was somewhat dissatisfied, Nina's happiness was the most important thing.

Richard and Nina stayed abroad for more than a month.

During this month, the two traveled everywhere, enjoying their sweet time.

In the evening, after coming out of Sweetie's room, Isabella received dozens of travel photos from Nina.

Most of them were scenic photos.

Isabella was looking at them enviously when Seb put his arm around her shoulder, "What are you looking at?"

"Photos from Nina." Isabella handed the phone over and flipped through the photos for him, "Nina said she and Richard are now in the Arctic. These photos were taken on-site. Look, aren't they as beautiful as wallpapers?"

"They're pretty nice."

Isabella's eyes showed a look of envy, "Nina said it's very cold there. Even wearing two down jackets, she still feels cold. She also said they are going to see the Northern Lights tonight and will take photos and videos for me. It must be beautiful."

"Yes."

"Don't you think Nina and Richard are so happy? I believe Nina must be very happy now."

"Yes."

"I guess Richard will propose abroad. Don't you think so?"

"Yes."

"Why do you keep saying yes?" Isabella felt that Seb was becoming more like a robot. Every time she talked to him about Nina and Richard recently, he would just say "yes."

Seb rubbed her fingers with a smile, "I just think you're right."

Isabella felt a bit stifled, "Seb, are you tired of me?"

Seb laughed, "No way. Don't overthink it."

"I just feel like you're tired of me. You've been brushing me off lately."

"I'm really not."

Isabella wanted to say more, but suddenly there was a knock on the door.

The knock was urgent and sharp, making people feel uneasy.

The couple exchanged a glance, "Who could it be so late?"

Seb got up, "I'll get the door."

Isabella also stood up, "I'll go with you."

When the door opened, both Seb and Isabella were a bit stunned.

"Kelsey? What are you doing here so late?"

"Bella." Kelsey started crying loudly as soon as she spoke.

Isabella and Seb let Kelsey into the house. Seb poured her some juice, and Isabella handed her a box of tissues to wipe her tears.

After Kelsey calmed down a bit, Isabella asked, "Did you have a fight with Jack?"

Isabella's question made Kelsey start crying again. "Bella, he wants to break up with me!"

"Break up? Why would he want to break up?"

Kelsey cried even harder, "He's going back to get married."

"What? You're his girlfriend. If he's getting married and not to you, then to whom?"

"Nancy!"

"What!" Isabella was stunned.

Seb, on the side, was also incredulous, "You must be mistaken. Nancy is Jack's sister."

"Jack was adopted by the Wilso family. He has no blood relation to Nancy. Now the Wilso family is forcing him to marry, and Jack agreed. He wants to break up with me!"

Kelsey had always been pampered by her family and had only experienced one setback in her love life with Seb.

Everyone around could see Kelsey's feelings for Jack.

Now that Jack was going to marry someone else, it was indeed a big blow to Kelsey.

Isabella comforted her, "Don't worry. Let Seb call to find out what's going on. Jack is Seb's subordinate; he will definitely listen to Seb."

This suggestion worked. Kelsey gradually stopped crying, "But Jack is the kind of person who always keeps his promises. Will he really listen to Seb?"

Isabella couldn't guarantee it, but they had to let Seb try.

What if there was another reason?

What if Jack changed his mind?

Just like she and Seb, after going through so much and clearing up misunderstandings, everything turned out fine.

Isabella didn't want Kelsey to suffer as much in love as she and Nina did.

Seb immediately in front of Kelsey dialed Jack's number.

"Mr. Landon." Jack's voice came through the receiver, and Kelsey bit her lip, looking at the phone nervously.

"What's going on between you and Kelsey?" Seb asked.

There was a long silence on the other end before Jack's voice came through, "Is she with you?"

"Yes."

"Please take care of her, and don't let her go back alone this late."

Seb frowned, "She's your girlfriend, so you should take care of her yourself. Where are you now? No matter where you are, come and pick her up immediately."

"Sorry, Mr. Landon, I can't leave."

"Jack, I'm hungry," Nancy's voice suddenly came from the background.

Kelsey grabbed Seb's phone, and shouted into it, "Jack, I'm asking you one last time, are you really going to marry Nancy and break up with me?"

"I'm sorry, Kelsey."

"Jack, if you want to break up, then let's break up. Whether you regret it in the future or not, I just want to tell you, never come back to find me!"

With that, Kelsey hung up the phone.

After hanging up, Kelsey stood there, looking like she had lost her soul.

Isabella held her arm, "Kelsey, don't be in a hurry. Tomorrow I'll ask him face to face."

"No need." Kelsey's tears fell, "Bella, I loved him so much, and even lowered myself for him repeatedly. Why does he have to treat me like this?"

"I will never like him again. If he wants to get married, let him." Kelsey wiped away her tears, "I'm going home now."

By the time Isabella and Seb chased after her, Kelsey had already driven away.

Worried about Kelsey's safety, Isabella and Seb followed her in their car.

Seeing Kelsey drive to a bar, Isabella became concerned, "I'll go to check on her."

Seb stopped her, looked up at the bar's sign, and explained, "This bar belongs to Michael. Don't worry, Kelsey won't be in any trouble on his turf."

Initially, it was Richard's, but later, when Richard got too busy, he handed it over to Michael to manage, and eventually, it became Michael's.

However, tonight, Michael wasn't there.

Since Richard went to Silvercrest, Michael had been handling affairs in Lakina, and the busiest, most profitable, and most chaotic place was the No. 1 Casino.

Michael had been there every day recently.

The bar was left in the hands of two of Michael's subordinates, who happened to know Kelsey.

From the moment Kelsey walked in, they kept an eye on her.

Kelsey ordered two drinks, sat in a booth, and started drinking.

When a man approached her, she cursed him away.

As she cursed, she started crying again.

Seeing something was wrong, the two immediately called Michael.

Ten minutes passed, Isabella and Seb were still sitting in the car, not seeing Kelsey come out.

After another minute, Isabella reached for the car door, "I can't wait any longer. I need to find Kelsey. What if she gets bullied?"

Seb said, "I'll go with you."

Before they could get out of the car, they heard the roar of a motorcycle speeding down the street. In just a few seconds, a black motorcycle zoomed by like a black lightning bolt, leaving a trail in the dim night.

At the bar entrance, the motorcycle made a sharp turn, leaving a skid mark on the ground, and came to a stylish stop.

A pair of black boots hit the ground, and the man took off his helmet, revealing a handsome face.

"It's Michael!" Isabella was about to get out of the car but was stopped by Seb.

She looked back at him, puzzled.

Seb watched Michael stride into the bar and voiced, "You know Michael likes Kelsey, right?"

"Yes." Isabella nodded.

Every time Michael saw Kelsey, his eyes were so intense that he seemed to want to devour her.

If Isabella couldn't see that, she would be truly blind.

She thought for a moment, "If Jack doesn't work out, Michael is a good choice."

Seeing Michael rush in like that, he must know Kelsey is inside. The fact that he dropped everything to come immediately shows he won't let Kelsey get hurt.

Seb smiled, "So, should we still find her?"

Isabella sat back in her seat, "No, let's go home."

"Before we go home, there's something I want to tell you."

"What is it?"

Seb took out his phone, tapped a few times, then handed it to her.

"What's this?" Isabella glanced at the phone, "Plane tickets?"

When she saw the details, her eyes widened, "Isabella? Seb? Sweetie? What's this?"

"I want to invite you and Sweetie to see the Northern Lights together." Seb uttered gently, "I've arranged everything at the company. If you have no objections, we can leave in three days. If we're lucky, we might even run into Nina and Richard."

Isabella was excited, her eyes welling up.

"Seb, you're so wonderful." She leaned over and hugged Seb.

Seb gently hugged her back, "I'm not perfect, but I'll keep improving."

Isabella smiled happily.

Kelsey had drunk too much.

She lay on the sofa, her tears still wet on her cheeks.

"Kelsey? Get up!" Someone was calling her, but she was too lazy to move, too lazy to respond. "Kelsey!"

That person was so annoying, like a fly buzzing in her ear, even shaking her.

Kelsey finally opened her eyes impatiently and saw a tall figure through the blurry lights.

"Michael?" Kelsey mumbled.

Michael patted her cheek with his palm, "Get up! I'll take you home."

Kelsey was a bit confused, her brain not fully under her control, but surprisingly obedient.

When he said to get up, she climbed off the sofa, but after sitting up, she felt dizzy and fell back down.

"I can't," she waved her hand, "I'm so dizzy, I can't stand up. I'll just sleep here."

Michael didn't force her. He stared at her for a while and then asked, "How about I call your boyfriend? Let him get you?"

"No!" Kelsey screamed.

The term "boyfriend" was a huge humiliation for her at that moment.

She curled up and murmured softly, "I don't have a boyfriend anymore. I just got dumped."

The music was too loud for Michael to hear her clearly.

But seeing her lips move, he was curious about what she was saying, so he squatted down in front of the sofa and leaned in to listen.

This time he heard her clearly.

Michael brushed his fingers across Kelsey's face, "You broke up?"

Kelsey half-opened her eyes, looking very hurt, "Yes."

Michael raised an eyebrow, "Why?"

Kelsey pressed her lips together, unwilling to say.

Michael chuckled, "You broke up with him and made yourself look so miserable. This isn't like the Kelsey I know. Shouldn't you have slapped him twice and walked away coolly?"

Tears slid down from the corner of her eyes, and she mumbled, "I couldn't do it."

Hearing this, Michael's heart almost broke. He couldn't help but stroke her forehead, "Do you love him that much?"

Kelsey just cried.

Michael sighed, "If a man doesn't behave, just replace him."

"Replace him?" Kelsey sobbed, "With whom?"

Michael laughed, "With me."

Both of them were silent for a long time.

Kelsey didn't know if she was scared awake by his words, but now her eyes were wide open, staring at Michael without blinking.

After a while, Michael broke the silence with a smile, "Are you sober now? Let's go, I'll take you home."

Just as he was about to get up, Kelsey suddenly grabbed his hand.

Then she hooked her arms around his neck and kissed Michael on the lips.

Michael was stunned, holding her shoulders to pull her back a bit, staring at her, "Kelsey, don't mess with me."

Without saying a word, Kelsey kissed him again.

Kelsey's lips were soft and tender, even more so than he had imagined.

Michael had been waiting for this for a long time.

With her taking the initiative, Michael immediately surrendered. He cupped the back of her head with his palm, pressed her hard into the sofa.

Kelsey was dizzy from his kiss, but her eyes kept glancing in a certain direction.

Just now, Jack was standing in that spot.

But now, he was nowhere to be seen.

Feeling a pang of sadness, Kelsey fainted in Michael's arms due to a lack of oxygen.

The next day, Margaret arranged dinner and invited Isabella and Seb to bring Sweetie over.

When Kelsey brought Michael back and introduced him as her new boyfriend, the whole family was shocked.

Margaret was still against their relationship. Compared to Kelsey dating Jack, she was even more opposed to Kelsey dating Michael.

But Kelsey was very determined.

During dinner, when Isabella mentioned they were going to see the Northern Lights, Kelsey turned to Michael and asked, "Let's go too?"

Just when everyone thought Michael wouldn't go along with her craziness, Michael nodded, "Okay. I'll make the arrangements."

Everyone was even more puzzled.

After Kelsey and Michael confirmed their relationship, they moved in together.

When Jack heard the news, he didn't say anything.

Jack's family was busy preparing for his wedding. The day before he was to get married, he voluntarily resigned to Seb.

Jack said he was going back to repay a debt of gratitude and would stay with his family from then on.

Seb and Isabella prepared a gift for him, and Seb voiced, "Your position at the Landon Group will always be open for you. Whenever you want to come back, you can."

Three days later.

Isabella and Seb, Michael and Kelsey, the four of them boarded a plane.

Jack went home to hold his wedding.

Zaire rushed back from out of town, upon learning everything, sighed, "You all have no conscience, going to see the Northern Lights without me?"

Margaret added beside him, "They're all couples going to see the Northern Lights. It's such a romantic thing. Why would they take a single person like you? To make a wish?"

Zaire laughed helplessly, "Mom, why are you so against me now? If I wanted a wife, it would be easy. If I waved my hand, the line of women wanting to be my wife would stretch from here to another country!"

Margaret waved her hand, "I only want Miley to be your wife. I don't approve of anyone else. If you can't marry Miley, you'll stay single for the rest of your life."

That night, Zaire found out that Miley had removed him from her blacklist.

He checked her status page, seeing that Miley had just posted a minute ago, [Going on my 256th date tomorrow. Wish me luck.]

Zaire silently gave it a like.

A minute later, Miley blocked him again.

The next morning, Margaret woke up to find Zaire gone.

The bed was neatly made, and his suitcase and some daily clothes were missing.

Margaret called him, and Zaire laughed, "I know you're anxious, but don't worry. I'm going to bring Miley back for you."

"Really? I'm getting old, don't fool me."

"It's true."

Margaret was overjoyed, "Then I'll wait at home for your good news."

Zaire said, "Don't just wait around. I'm planning to take her to join Kelsey, Seb, and the others."

"Good,Â Seeing the Northern Lights is great. I fully support it."

A year later.

The wedding of the Jose family's son and daughter made headlines nationwide.

Nina and Richard, Zaire and Miley.

The two couples held a joint wedding, and the event was indescribably luxurious.

When Jack walked into his house carrying a grocery basket, the phone on the sofa was still streaming the wedding live.

The screen happened to show a familiar figure, and someone in the comments said, [Wow, is that Kelsey from the Jose family? She's so beautiful!]

Jack's eyes softened as he stared at Kelsey, unable to look away.

But soon, the camera cut to another scene.

The wedding was so grand that the media wouldn't focus solely on Kelsey.

A hint of disappointment flashed in Jack's eyes as he quietly turned off the phone, plunging the room into silence.

He was about to head to the kitchen when he suddenly heard the sounds of lovemaking from the bedroom.

Jack's steps froze. He walked to the bedroom, pushing it open. The couple on the bed was startled.

The man, seeing Jack, panicked and tried to find his pants.

The woman, however, wrapped her legs tightly around the man's waist and said coquettishly, "Don't mind him."

"But he's your husband."

"He won't be for long," the woman answered seductively, "Let's continue."

Jack walked in, grabbed the man from the bed, and gave him a severe beating.

"This is the divorce agreement. Sign it, and we will have nothing to do with each other anymore." Nancy threw the pen on the table, her eyes fixed on Jack.

Jack said nothing. Just as he picked up the pen, Nancy rushed to slap it out of his hand.

Jack bent down to pick it up, and Nancy, like a madwoman, kept hitting him.

Jack picked up the pen and restrained her wrist, "What are you doing?"

Nancy burst into tears, "Jack! We've been married for a year, but you won't make love to me! Can't I find another man to satisfy my needs? I know you were forced to marry me, but we're already married. Can't you respect me as your wife?"

Jack lowered his eyes, "Why are you saying this now?"

Nancy shook her head and hugged him, pleading, "Jack, I was confused for a moment for donig this. Please forgive me this once. If you treat me well as your wife from now on, I promise to be faithful and never mess around again."

Jack pried her hands off, "No need. I've repaid my debt to the Wilso family."

"No! You can never repay what you owe the Wilso family! I don't want a divorce! Jack, I love you. I just needed to vent. I'm a woman with normal sexual needs. Please forgive me this once."

"Once?" Jack looked at her coldly, "Was it really just once?"

Nancy was stunned.

How many times exactly, she couldn't even count.

"Jack." Nancy's tears flowed like rain.

Jack signed the divorce agreement, packed his things, and left.

Sitting in his car, he thought about calling Nancy's mother to stay with her.

But before he could dial, he saw a man rushing upstairs.

Kelsey was happy and had a bit to drink.

She wanted to drink more, but Michael stopped her.

After the wedding, they walked hand in hand along the roadside, leaving their car behind.

When they got tired, they sat on a bench to rest.

"Michael."

"Yes?"

"I want some cake."

Michael nodded, "I'll go buy some."

Watching him walk away, Kelsey felt a sudden pang of sadness.

Over the past year, Michael had been really good to her.

He treated her almost like a child, pampering her.

He had also gradually changed her parents' prejudices against him.

Now, Michael was recognized by everyone as Kelsey's future husband.

Tonight, the wedding of Zaire and Nina had a big impact on Kelsey.

She wondered if it was time for her to settle down too.

Kelsey saw a blind person trying to cross the street, but because the tactile paving was blocked by something, the blind person was anxiously turning in circles.

Seeing the countdown on the green light, Kelsey ran over, helping the person across the street.

The blind person kept bowing and thanking her.

Kelsey helped him to the tactile paving and watched him leave.

At that moment, she saw a familiar figure standing on the left side of the street.

It was Jack!

Kelsey's heart skipped a beat. Unexpected reunions always catch people off guard.

Jack smiled at her.

Kelsey instinctively wanted to walk over, but she suddenly sensed something and turned to the right. She saw Michael standing at the right corner.

Clearly, Michael had also seen Jack.

At that moment, the pedestrian light was green. Michael was holding a cake but didn't walk over.

Michael and Jack stood at two different corners, two different paths.

The city's neon lights flickered, and Kelsey stood at the intersection, unsure which way to go.
