###Chapter 1:
“Hmm…” Sadie Hudson murmured softly, her eyes fluttering open into a drowsy blur, only to be met with the intense gaze of another pair of eyes.
Her husband, Noah Wall, had quietly returned, his presence subtly marked by the faint scent of alcohol.
He sealed their reunion with a kiss that was unyielding in its dominance, compelling her into reluctant acquiescence.
A wave of unease surged through Sadie’s chest, and reflexively, she attempted to withdraw.
“Stay still.” Noah’s voice rumbled, deep and seductive, tinged with a compelling charm that was hard to resist.
For a moment, Sadie’s body tensed, caught in a struggle between resistance and submission.
Today was significant— it was their second anniversary—and she was determined not to spoil the celebratory mood.
With a sigh, she closed her eyes, allowing herself to melt into his embrace.
The robust scent of his cologne masked the alcohol, swirling around her and piercing her heart with its potent allure.
Noah’s eyes darkened with desire as he observed her yielding, his actions becoming bolder and less restrained.
Just as Sadie was about to regain her composure, she gasped softly, her plea laced with tender fragility. “Please, not too harsh…”
She couldn’t complete her revelation of being pregnant. The sharp ring of a phone sliced through the thick tension, abruptly severing the intimate moment between them.
Noah’s eyes, still ablaze with longing, flickered as he caught sight of the caller ID.
He got up and began to dress, his movements betraying none of the fervor that had engulfed him just moments before.

“Are you heading out?” Sadie inquired, her voice tinged with a mix of confusion and concern as she tightened her grip on her nightgown.
“Yeah,” Noah answered, his tone breezy and dismissive, as if evading further inquiry.
“But…”
“Go back to sleep,” he interjected smoothly, his voice soft yet detached. He leaned forward, his lips briefly caressing her forehead in a fleeting, tender gesture.
Without a single backward glance, he strode out of the room.
Sadie’s eyes lingered on the empty doorway, her heart sinking slowly. She convinced herself it had to be an emergency at work.
Understanding was essential; any sign of displeasure could drive him further away.
After all, she had loved Noah for over a decade, and becoming his wife was a dream realized. She could hardly expect more.
With a sigh, Sadie quickly freshened up and returned to bed, her hand resting gently on her belly, a hopeful smile playing at the corners of her mouth.
“Sweetheart, Daddy didn’t mean to leave us by ourselves. Please, don’t hold it against him, alright?”
No sooner had she uttered these words than her phone buzzed with an unexpected news alert, startling her.
“Wall Group CEO Spotted at the Airport Late at Night, Allegedly Picking Up Mysterious Girlfriend.”
The photo that accompanied the headline captured Noah at the airport’s private terminal entrance, clad in a black suit. He stood with impeccable posture, exuding an undeniable aura of authority. His eyes conveyed a softness, a tender warmth that Sadie had never observed before.
Shock flashed across Sadie’s face as her heart thudded painfully in her chest, the sharp sensation nearly stealing her breath.
It took a considerable effort for her to regain her composure. Clutching onto a sliver of hope, she clicked on the article, her fingers quivering.
As she had feared, a familiar face filled the screen—Kyla Wade. The woman Noah had seemingly been unable to forget was evidently back in his life.
A chill spread through Sadie, a profound sorrow embedding itself deep within her heart.
She clenched her teeth, forcefully suppressing her cries.
The memory of how her marriage had begun was too painful to revisit. Two years earlier, just as Kyla and Noah had been planning their future together, Kyla had vanished without a trace.
At that critical juncture, with Noah poised to secure the position of chairman of the board and in dire need of a compliant wife, Sadie, known for her unwavering devotion to him and from a family now in decline, had become the ideal candidate.
For the past two years, Sadie had been a docile wife, enveloped in a sense of unworthiness, as if the joy she experienced was never truly meant for her.
That illusion shattered yesterday when she discovered she was pregnant.
They had always been meticulous in preventing pregnancy, except for that one night last month. Noah had staggered home, reeking of alcohol after a business dinner, and in his drunken haze, they had lost themselves to passion.
That fleeting lapse had now culminated in her pregnancy.
Now, Sadie was tormented by uncertainty on how to break the news to Noah.
She dreaded that Noah would demand an abortion.
Deep down, she knew she wasn’t the woman he loved.
When Sadie was still engulfed in a whirlpool of anxious thoughts, her reverie was broken by Noah’s voice echoing from the study.
Was he already home?
She rose, pulling a light coat around her shoulders, and made her way to the study.
Just as she neared the door, the playful tones of Alex Howe, Noah’s friend, reached her ears. “Did you really spend the entire night with Kyla?”
Sadie felt her heart plummet.
So it was true. Noah had spent the night with Kyla.noveldrama
“Mm-hmm,” Noah responded, his voice empty of any discernible emotion.
“What’s your take on Sadie, then? After two years as husband and wife, you can’t possibly say she means nothing to you, can you?” Alex’s voice softened with concern. “She’s truly remarkable, you know. If you fail to see her worth, someone else surely will, and you’ll be left with nothing but regret.”
“I only feel a faint stir of guilt,” Noah retorted, his voice cold and distant, as if discussing something trivial. “If you’re so taken with her, perhaps I should do the matchmaking. But really, shouldn’t you be getting back to work? Off you go.”
Guilt? Was that the only thing Noah felt towards her? As this stark realization dawned on Sadie, a solitary tear traced a silent path down her cheek. Her hand fell away from the doorknob, trembling.
It was painfully clear—he had never truly loved her.
In the recesses of Noah’s heart, she was just an insignificant trifle he could easily hand off to another.
A shiver of desolation coursed through her.
With a swift turn, Sadie darted into the sanctuary of the garden, her heart pounding wildly.
There, she huddled down, burying her face in her knees, her tears distorting the world around her.
Memories flooded back—the day she first met Noah, ten years ago. He had been the epitome of charm and vitality, born of privilege, effortlessly stealing the hearts of every girl at school.
And Sadie, newly vulnerable from her family’s downfall, had been easy prey for ridicule.
It was Noah who had stepped in like a guardian, his words like shields, commanding others to back down.
In those moments, he had been her savior, her angel.

###Chapter 2:
It was at that time that Sadie fell hopelessly in love with Noah.
In the days following his departure to study abroad, she immersed herself completely in her studies, eventually earning a place at his university.
She harbored the belief that excellence could bridge the gap between them.
Finally, one day, he approached her and proposed marriage.
She believed her affections had thawed his indifference.
However, she was mistaken.
Noah’s heart had always belonged to Kyla.
To him, she was nothing more than a stand-in.
Taking a deep breath, Sadie fought to control the whirlwind of emotions threatening to overwhelm her.
Pregnant and under doctor’s orders to maintain her composure, she knew she had to be strong for her unborn child.
Brushing away her tears, she rose and made her way back to the bedroom.
Unprepared for Noah’s lack of empathy, she was met with his blunt announcement as soon as he entered the room.
“Kyla is back,” he declared. “I think it’s time we got a divorce.”
The word “divorce” struck Sadie with the force of a physical blow, robbing her of breath.
Until he uttered it, she had clung to a sliver of hope, however frail.
It took Sadie a painfully long time to muster the courage to speak.
“You’re leaving me now that she’s returned?” Her voice quivered, betraying her attempt to mask her vulnerability.
Noah’s brow furrowed as he regarded her with evident displeasure.
gα?ησν?s?com, the place for amazing tales
“I was clear from the start when we married—don’t long for what can never be truly yours. Anything you desire, I’ll ensure you’re compensated.”
Those harsh words had been his vow on their wedding night, a night meant only to quell the relentless whispers of the corporate board.
His heart had never been hers to claim.
Driven by a fool’s hope, Sadie had thrown herself at him, believing she could stir some emotion in him.
Sadie raised her eyes to Noah’s, a silent plea for truth in her gaze.
“All those nights we shared… were you imagining I was Kyla?”
Noah was caught off guard by her blunt question. He hesitated, his mouth opening slightly, but no words came.
Sadie interpreted his silence as the stark admission she had feared, and it shattered her already fragile heart.
Deep down, she had always understood that Noah’s heart was not in their union.
Yet, the fleeting moments of happiness during their intimate nights had momentarily blinded her to this brutal reality.
She had mistaken their physical closeness for emotional acceptance.
But she had been tragically mistaken.
Throughout their entire tumultuous entanglement, Noah’s heart had remained elusive to her.
With a profound sigh, Sadie closed her eyes and resigned herself to her fate.
“Fine, I consent to the divorce,” she declared resignedly.
Turning on her heel, she collected a few personal belongings, deciding to spend the night in the guest room.
Noah’s gaze lingered on her, his forehead creasing in frustration, a subtle annoyance brewing within him.
As Sadie brushed past him, Noah reached out instinctively, clasping her hand, poised to say something.
Yet, just as he opened his mouth, Kyla’s call interrupted him. Reluctantly, Noah let go of Sadie’s hand to answer, and Sadie made her way to the guest room.
“Hello, Kyla… It’s nothing, really…”
Sadie couldn’t hear the rest of Noah’s words.
All she could discern was the unexpected softness in Noah’s voice, a stark contrast to the coldness he reserved for her.
She shut the door of the guest room, threw herself onto the bed, and clamped a hand over her mouth to muffle her cries.
Even as she grappled with the harsh reality of their impending divorce, the stinging disparity between Noah’s indifference to her and his warmth towards Kyla pierced her heart deeply.
What was she to do now? And what of their unborn child?
Sadie was completely at a loss.
All she knew was that she felt exhausted, hurt, and desperate to flee from everything.
The sound of cascading water filled the bathroom as Sadie absentmindedly shed her clothes and stepped into the shower. Although the warm water cascaded over her, it did nothing to thaw the cold grip of sadness clutching her heart.
She sank down, curling into herself and burying her face against her knees. The relentless roar of the shower muffled her sobs as she finally let go, tears streaming down uncontrollably.
Why? Why did he have to be so cruel?
Exhausted from crying, she stood up and got dressed, but suddenly, her foot slipped on the slick surface.
A jolt of sharp pain surged through her as she couldn’t hold back a pained cry. Instinctively, her hands flew to her lower abdomen, cradling the spot where she felt the impact.
In the master bedroom, the sound of Sadie’s distress reached Noah. He immediately sprinted toward the source of the noise.
The bathroom door was ajar, and he caught sight of Sadie crumpled on the floor.
Her complexion was ghostly pale, a sheen of cold sweat on her skin, her attire in disarray, and her hands fervently guarding her abdomen as if she had taken a hit.
A sudden pang of concern tightened Noah’s chest.
He hurried to Sadie, quickly scooping her up from the cold, wet floor.
“What happened to you? Are you injured anywhere?”
Noah’s voice trembled with a barely detectable undercurrent of panic.
Sadie’s mind reeled, her vision blurring slightly as she tried to focus on the man before her. It took her a moment to muster a response through the haze of her confusion.
“I’m fine…” Her words were barely a whisper.
She attempted to wriggle free from Noah’s embrace, but he tightened his grip.
“Stay still,” Noah commanded, his voice firm, tinged with urgency.
Sadie ceased her struggling, subdued by his tone.
He continued with a softer edge, “Let me make sure you’re not hurt.” Gently, he laid her onto the bed.
Leaning over, Noah meticulously examined her for any injuries, his expression a mix of concern and focus.
This unexpected gentleness rekindled a wavering spark of hope within Sadie.noveldrama
She seized his hand abruptly, her voice cracking as she posed a question loaded with fear and desperation.
“Noah, what if I were to tell you I’m pregnant? Would you still push for a divorce?”
The possibility of keeping their marriage intact for the sake of a child lingered in the air.
Sadie searched Noah’s eyes for any sign of reconsideration.
Noah paused, his face unreadable for a brief moment before he replied coldly, “We’ve always been careful. It’s unlikely you’re pregnant. But even if it were true, the situation wouldn’t change—you’d have to end the pregnancy.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 3:
Sadie’s complexion drained of color, leaving her ghostly pale.
Noah had just delivered his harsh decree for her to end the pregnancy. His indifference was a dagger to her heart.
“Why? Noah, even if you don’t want this child, must you be so merciless?” Sadie’s voice trembled, disbelief etching her features.
Noah returned her gaze with icy detachment, his voice a deep, unwavering growl.
“Our marriage is merely a contractual arrangement. A child would only make things messy.”
Crushed, Sadie averted her eyes, the sting of rejection too potent to bear. Internally, her sorrow carved through her, deep and relentless.
After collecting herself, she said, her tone defiant, her resolve firm, “Don’t you worry, Noah. I would never burden you with a child!”
Her decision was made: she would keep the baby, but not for him—for herself.
One day, she would tell her child that their father was a part of her past, nothing more.
Noah’s brow creased slightly.
“I’m glad you see it that way. You’re not feeling great. Take some time to rest. No need to worry about work for now.”
Without another word, he exited Sadie’s room, his silhouette disappearing into the hallway.
Despite his words, Sadie appeared at the company the very next day.
The weight of raising a child alone left no room for weakness. No matter how drained she felt, she had to push through—there was no luxury of rest.
She worked at Wall Group. She had joined its secretarial department right out of college to be close to Noah.noveldrama
Their marriage was a well-kept secret, hidden from the eyes of the oblivious majority, except for Noah’s assistant, Samuel Ford, and a select few executives.
Step into a new journey on .con
As soon as Sadie stepped into the bustling secretarial department, she noticed a crowd huddled in front of the meeting room, buzzing with hushed, eager whispers.
“So that’s the woman everyone’s been whispering about—Mr. Wall’s rumored girlfriend.”
“Rumored? She’s practically official, okay? Don’t forget she was the reason Mr. Wall spiraled into that slump two years back.”
“Apparently, they’ve known each other since they were just kids in elementary school.”
“Mr. Wall actually held back during the meeting just now—no scolding at all. Guess his sweetheart was watching.”
“And now, Miss Wade’s stepping in as Mr. Wall’s private senior legal counsel. Talk about a power couple.”
Each whispered word struck Sadie like a sharp, icy dagger, slicing through the facade of her calm demeanor.
The memories of Noah’s enduring affection for Kyla, even remembered vividly by the employees, haunted her.
She felt utterly insignificant.
Sadie bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, her nails digging into the flesh of her palms, a physical counter to the emotional pain.
She forced herself to block out the murmurs, to ignore the stabs of jealousy, and to focus on her tasks as if nothing had disrupted the ordinary.
But the words clung to her, a relentless echo in her mind, taunting her with their cruel, magical persistence.
Suddenly, nausea overwhelmed her.
Sadie stood abruptly, her chair scraping back, and hurried to the restroom.
To mask her discomfort, she cranked the faucet to full blast, the sound of rushing water a feeble shield against any curious ears. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 4:noveldrama
It wasn’t until after she had vomited nothing but bitter bile that Sadie felt the turmoil inside her subside slightly.
She splashed her face with cold water, each droplet a small shock to her system, helping her piece her composure back together.
With a deep breath, she steadied herself and left the restroom. The door to the meeting room was slightly open as she walked by, just enough for her to see Noah and Kyla sitting side by side.
Kyla tilted her body forward in a pose that spoke of elegance and deliberate grace.
Her voice was soft, almost a whisper, and her eyes glinted with a mix of allure and subtle seduction.
They were so close their shoulders almost touched, casting them in the intimate silhouette of a couple deeply in tune with each other. Watching from afar, Sadie felt like a forgotten shadow lingering on the edges of their world.
In her own marriage, she had always been the one on the outside, peering in, never truly part of the picture.
Tears welled up quietly, tracing a silent path down her cheeks. As she turned to leave, her elbow caught a potted plant, sending it crashing to the floor with a clatter that sliced through the quiet.
The sudden noise jerked Noah’s attention away from Kyla. His eyes found Sadie’s, locking onto her with a mixture of surprise and something colder, harder.
Embarrassed by her own clumsiness and overwhelmed by her feelings, Sadie felt frustrated.
Noah stepped outside, his presence now overwhelming, and Kyla, quick as a flash, appeared beside him.
“What are you doing here?” Noah’s voice was sharp, edged with clear displeasure at the sight of Sadie.
It didn’t take long for Kyla to figure out Sadie’s identity.
Dive into fiction with gα?ησν?s．com
Yet, she pretended not to know, flashing a sugary smile as she asked, “Noah, who is she?”
And there it was—the question that hung in the air, heavy and oppressive. Who was she?
Sadie’s heart ached to know just where she stood in Noah’s life.
The disdain in her expression was evident, and Noah’s features tightened, a flicker of displeasure crossing his face. He responded curtly, “She’s just an employee.”
Just an employee?
The phrase echoed mockingly in Sadie’s ears, amplifying her sense of insignificance.
She felt reduced to nothing—a mere shadow within the cold, unyielding walls of their workplace.
No sooner had Noah finished speaking than he turned around and strode away.
Kyla paused to shoot Sadie a smug, provocative glance, her eyes gleaming with triumph, before she hurried after Noah.
Left alone, Sadie felt adrift, as if standing in the midst of a strange, unfathomable world.
Lost in a haze for the rest of the workday, Sadie was jolted back to reality by an unexpected call from her grandmother, Laura Stewart.
“Sadie, I’m not getting any younger, and who knows how much time I have left. More than anything, I dream of the day you’re settled, with a loving spouse and children by your side. So, when are you finally bringing your boyfriend to meet me?”
As Laura spoke with warmth and ease, Sadie found herself swallowing hard, emotion creeping up on her.
Even Laura, the one who had always been there for her, was completely unaware that she was married. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 5:
Noah had set the terms before their wedding—beyond the board of directors, it was best to keep their marriage under wraps.
He surely anticipated Kyla’s return, didn’t he?
Every step of the way, he had been silently working to make things easier for Kyla.
The moment she hung up was a blur, but one thing stuck—her promise to Laura that she’d bring her boyfriend home this Saturday. But just who was she supposed to show up with?noveldrama
Sadie’s mind was in chaos as she hastily collected her things and exited the office.
As she stood on the curb, her eyes searching the street, a sleek Maybach slid to a stop before her.
The window descended slowly, unveiling the striking features of a man whose appearance never failed to draw admiring gasps from onlookers.
It was none other than Noah.
“Get in,” he called out, his voice smooth and authoritative.
Despite her urge to decline, the memory of Laura’s unsettling phone call earlier made Sadie step into the car with resignation.
This time, she deliberately chose the back seat instead of the front.
“I told you I’d compensate you, but don’t think acting pitiful will make me feel sorry for you,” Noah remarked, a hint of reproach in his tone.
“Acting pitiful?”
The irony of his words struck Sadie, and a laugh, sharp and devoid of any real amusement, escaped her.
“When are we getting divorced?” she asked, her voice tinged with a brittle, hollow quality.
Noah, puzzled by her laughter, replied, “Relax, there’s no need to rush—it’s not the right time.”

“And where are we going now?” Sadie pressed, her frustration mounting.
“We’re heading back to the family estate—Grandpa wants to see you,” Noah explained, his voice softening.
Noah’s grandfather, Nigel Wall, stood as a pillar of warmth in Sadie’s chaotic life, second only to Laura.
Since her family’s financial collapse in middle school and the mysterious disappearance of her parents, kindness had been a rare luxury in Sadie’s life.
Noah’s presence had once brightened her entire existence.
Now, everything seemed to be reverting to a gray, mundane reality.
Sadie remained silent, her quietness an implicit nod of agreement. After a long pause, her voice, barely above a whisper, broke the silence.
“One month.”
“What?” Noah’s confusion was palpable.
“I want the divorce finalized within a month,” she declared, her tone resolute yet tinged with a hidden urgency.
If the proceedings dragged on, Noah might uncover her secret—she was pregnant.
Given his attachment to Kyla, he would undoubtedly demand she end the pregnancy, and she was determined not to forsake her unborn child.
Noah’s brow creased in annoyance. “The decision’s been made, Sadie. Stop playing these mind games with me,” he said, his voice laced with frustration.
He knew all too well how deeply she cared for him, which always left him wrestling with a sense of guilt.
However, he was adamant that her feelings couldn’t be used as leverage in their strained negotiations. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 6:
With a stern tone, he added, “Until the divorce is official, we need to keep up appearances. Let’s not give anything away.”
Sadie felt a sharp sting in her eyes at his harsh words.
“Noah, you really have a heart of stone when it comes to me,” she murmured, her voice breaking.
She slightly lowered the car window, turned her head to gaze out, and let the brisk wind dry her tears.
Their car wound its way toward the Wall Manor, located on a lush, prestigious hill in Buirhon, a mere half-hour drive from the bustling city center. The car leisurely pulled into the yard, marking their arrival with a gentle halt.
Noah swung the car door open for Sadie, gracefully shielding her head with his broad palm, a gesture brimming with consideration.
Despite her knowledge of his theatrical display, Sadie found herself momentarily captivated by his charm.
As they strode forward, Noah’s warm grip enclosed her hand. Sadie hesitated, her fingers twitching as she attempted a subtle escape from his clasp.
Unprepared for her sudden resistance, Noah stumbled slightly, turning to face her with a bewildered expression.
In that unexpected moment, as Sadie looked up to meet his gaze, their lips brushed softly against each other.
A shiver of surprise raced through Sadie, her eyes reflecting an astonished sparkle.
“Noah…” she whispered, her voice trailing off as she stepped back. Her retreat was cut short by the sudden appearance of Nigel emerging from the grand house.
Caught off guard, Sadie allowed Noah to reclaim her hand as Nigel tapped his cane with feigned annoyance.noveldrama
“Well, well, look who finally showed up! I was starting to think you’d forgotten me.” His voice carried a playful rebuke.

Under usual circumstances, Sadie would have stepped forward to appease him.
However, today she stood frozen, uncertain of the role she was supposed to play before Nigel.
His keen eyes, seasoned by years in the business world, didn’t miss the tension between the young couple.
“Noah’s being ridiculous, putting you through unnecessary stress,” Nigel stated, his gaze softening with empathy towards Sadie while shooting a disapproving glare at Noah.
Noah, lips pressed in a thin line, remained silent, soaking in the weight of Nigel’s words.
“I’m fine, Nigel,” Sadie murmured, her lips curving into a strained smile that failed to reach her eyes, which shimmered with unspoken loneliness.
She was aware of Nigel’s genuine concern for her, yet she knew his affection couldn’t alter her situation.
“Still claiming you’re fine?” Nigel’s voice was gentle, laced with worry as he took Sadie’s hand in his. “You look pale. Come, let’s have a chess match. It’s been far too long since our last one.”
With a hesitant nod, Sadie allowed herself to be led into the grandeur of the house.
From a distance, Noah observed them, his brow creased with a mixture of confusion and concern.
Although he had mentally prepared himself for the divorce from Sadie, the sight of her finding solace in Nigel’s company stirred an unexpected pang of regret in his heart.
As Sadie stepped into the living room, her gaze fell upon Kyla. Poised and elegant, Kyla sat on the sofa, a coffee cup in hand, laughing merrily with Noah’s mother, Isabel Wall. 
.

.
###Chapter 7:
Kyla’s eyes widened in feigned surprise when she noticed Sadie. “Hello, you’re one of Noah’s employees, right?”
Isabel chimed in with a venomous tone, barely disguising her disdain, “Is that how Noah introduced her? Looking at the mess she is, it’s clear why he doesn’t want to admit to their relationship.” She then turned to Kyla, patting her hand with approval. “Fortunately, you’re back, Kyla.”
Kyla cast an apologetic glance at Isabel. “I’m sorry, Isabel. Leaving for my studies abroad was a mistake. If I hadn’t, you and Noah wouldn’t have had to worry all this time.”
Isabel huffed dismissively. “Well, it’s a relief you’re back now. Some people who’ve overstayed their welcome will finally have to step aside.”
“Enough already!” Nigel snapped, his glare slicing through the tension as he stared Isabel down, silencing her instantly.
Sadie and Isabel had never gotten along.
Isabel, always looking down her nose at Sadie, considered her as nothing more than a bankrupt heiress trying to claw her way into the Wall family’s vast fortune.
In the past, Sadie had to navigate these treacherous waters with grace, swallowing her pride even when she felt deeply aggrieved.
But now, with divorce proceedings looming on the horizon, she no longer felt compelled to humble herself before Isabel.
Brushing off the chilly atmosphere, Sadie strode confidently across the room to where Nigel sat, taking a seat beside him.
At that moment, Noah pushed the door open and stepped inside. The moment he walked in, Kyla sprang up and approached him, looping her arm around his.
“Noah, you’re finally back,” she cooed, her voice dripping with the honeyed tones of a wife who had awaited her husband’s return for long.
Noah’s reaction was swift and cool. He slipped his arm away, his eyes narrowing slightly. “What are you doing here?” he asked, his tone icy.
Find your next chapter gα?ησvs?com
Before Kyla could muster a reply, Isabel interjected smoothly, “She’s here because I invited her. It’s been too long since her last visit, so I thought we’d catch up.”
Two years earlier, Isabel had fallen victim to a disastrous investment scam, losing a substantial sum. It was Kyla who had stepped in to untangle the mess, a deed that had quietly solidified her status in Isabel’s eyes as the preferred daughter-in-law.
Kyla cast a sorrowful glance at Sadie, her voice trembling slightly. “Maybe I shouldn’t have come. It might be best if I leave now. I don’t want to cause any trouble for you, Noah.” She turned dramatically towards the door.
Noah, visibly annoyed yet restrained, stopped her and said, “No, don’t overthink things. Stay.”
Sadie observed their interactions from the sidelines, her heart sinking with a bitter sense of irony.
Officially, she was Noah’s wife, yet she sat there, feeling more like an unwelcome intruder in his life.
Restlessness crept up on her, making it impossible to remain passive any longer.
“Shall we go to the study now, Nigel?” Sadie suggested, her voice steadier than she felt.
Nigel, leaning heavily on his cane, responded with a sneer, “I may be old, but I’ve still got some fight left in me! As for my granddaughter-in-law, Sadie is the only one I acknowledge. The others don’t even come close!”
He paused for emphasis, his tone hardening. “And let me be clear—if I hear of anyone here hurting Sadie, they can kiss my shares goodbye.”noveldrama
At this declaration, Kyla clenched her fists, her nails almost digging into her palms, a clear flash of jealousy sparking in her eyes. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 8:
Isabel, visibly upset, bit her lip, holding back her words.
Noah bristled at the confrontation, loathing the sensation of being cornered, especially by Nigel.
“Then go ahead and donate your shares,” he retorted sharply, tugging at Kyla’s arm to leave.
“What did you just say, you ungrateful brat…” Nigel’s voice trembled with fury, his body shaking as he struggled to maintain his composure. Quickly, Sadie offered support as she guided him into the sanctuary of the study.
Once inside, she spoke, her tone low and filled with weary acceptance. “Don’t bother forcing him—his heart was never mine to begin with.”
Watching her composed demeanor, Nigel exhaled a heavy sigh, a mix of admiration and sorrow. “It’s truly Noah’s loss, not yours.”
He knew deep down that no matter how much he wanted to, he couldn’t steer the lives of the younger generation.
It pained him to see Sadie mistreated.
With a resigned air, he pulled a document from his drawer and laid it before her.
“Sadie, please, sign this.”
The moment Sadie spotted the word “shares” on the contract, a sudden, piercing tension gripped her head.
With a firm hand, she slid the document across the table, her voice steady but laced with resignation. “This isn’t mine to take. I married Noah knowing full well he had someone else in his heart. Now that she’s here, it’s only fitting that we put an end to our marriage.” With a solemn expression, Nigel ventured cautiously, “Sadie, do you ever regret marrying Noah?”
His question, unexpected and direct, made Sadie pause. She was momentarily taken aback, then offered a bitter smile as she shook her head. “No, I don’t regret it,” she admitted, her voice tinged with a sorrowful resolve.
Despite the searing pain, her love for Noah was something she could never regret.

Yet, this love had grown too burdensome, teetering on the brink of crushing her.
Sadie refused to sign the document.
Nigel, seeing he couldn’t sway her, handed her a card instead. As she stood to leave, he told her that if it became unbearable, she had no reason to keep suffering.
He cared for Sadie with the affection one might show a beloved granddaughter, even if it meant standing against his own grandson.
After she stepped away from the grandeur of the Wall Manor, Sadie didn’t return to the home she still shared with Noah.
Instead, she found solace in a modest, serviced apartment managed by a hotel.
It had a bedroom and a living room, fully furnished, offering her solitude at an affordable price.
Sadie grew to cherish this small, cozy sanctuary.
Most importantly, it was free from Noah’s presence and the excruciating memories that lingered around him.
After a refreshing rinse, Sadie scrolled through her contacts, a pang of helplessness washing over her.
No matter how she looked at it, she had no one to pretend to be her boyfriend.
What excuse could she possibly give Laura for showing up alone? A wave of frustration crested within her, prompting her to run her fingers agitatedly through her hair.
Accepting the inevitable, she surrendered to whatever happened next. If pressed, she’d lay out the truth for Laura—plain and simple.
With her mind somewhat settled, Sadie busied herself with tidying the space.
Thankfully, the little one nestled within her was cooperative today, not stirring up any discomfort.

###Chapter 9:
Just as she was lost in her cleaning frenzy, her phone buzzed to life.
Noah was calling.
Sadie’s heart skipped. She was torn between answering and ignoring the call, but ultimately, she picked up.
Noah’s voice, icy and sharp, cut through the silence. “Where the hell are you, Sadie? Why aren’t you home? You’re not causing trouble again, are you?”
“Me? Causing trouble?” Sadie’s laugh was tinged with bitterness. “Considering we’re getting a divorce, I don’t see how my whereabouts are your concern.”
“Listen,” Sadie interjected, her tone firm yet cool, “I’ve accepted this divorce. I won’t be clinging to you. And I’d appreciate it if you’d refrain from bothering me further, Mr. Wall.”
With a decisive click, Sadie ended the call, leaving Noah to stew in silence on the other end.
His face twisted in anger as the line went dead. How dare this woman hang up on him!
In the days that ensued, Sadie meticulously dodged any encounters with Noah.
Since they both worked at Wall Group, it was almost unbelievable how their paths never crossed.
Sadie worked tirelessly, determined to finish the project at hand. Once it was wrapped up, she’d make sure the divorce was final, then hand in her resignation and leave Wall Group behind.
As the week spiraled into a brisk Saturday morning, Sadie, clutching a box of Laura’s favorite pastries, made her way to the old, familiar teacher’s apartment building.
Laura, a dedicated elementary school teacher of many years, still resided within the modest confines of the apartment building.
Just as Sadie was navigating the leaf-strewn path from the school grounds to the apartment building, she was startled by Alex’s voice, tinged with surprise.

“Sadie? What brings you here?” he inquired, his eyebrows arching in curiosity.
Sadie turned around to look at him, her face mirroring his surprise. “Oh, my grandmother lives here. How about you?” she replied, her tone a mix of astonishment and curiosity.
Alex’s eyes widened even further, his face a canvas of shock. “Really? I’ve never seen you around. Noa—uh, I mean, I used to go to school here.”
He stumbled over his words, waving a sheaf of documents. “I’m currently involved in some plans for expanding the school.”
Nodding with a newfound understanding, Sadie offered a smile. “I only came here once or twice a year during my childhood, so it’s likely we just missed each other,” she explained, her voice steady and composed.
As Sadie prepared to bid Alex farewell and continue on her way, Laura emerged from the apartment building with a bright, welcoming smile. Her eyes landed on Alex, and she radiated warmth as she approached him, laying a gentle hand on his shoulder.
“Young man, what’s your name?” she asked with a tone of friendly curiosity.
Alex, a touch bewildered by Laura’s fervent greeting, cautiously responded, “Oh, you’re Sadie’s grandmother, right? Pleased to meet you, I’m Alex Howe.”
His charm was enough to make Laura’s smile bloom effortlessly.
Meanwhile, Sadie lingered in the background, her intuition telling her that this cheerful encounter might soon take an awkward turn.
“No, Grandma, you—” she interjected, tugging at Laura’s sleeve.noveldrama
Yet, Laura shot her a playful, teasing look and chuckled. “What do you mean, ‘no’? You’ve brought him here, and now you’re getting all flustered?”
Confusion clouded Alex’s features.
It took him a moment to catch on.

###Chapter 10:
Did Laura take things the wrong way?
“No, I—” he said, attempting to clear the air, but Laura cut him off before he could continue.
“Come on in, Alex,” Laura said, her voice warm and inviting as she ushered them into the building. Their path was marked by lively exchanges with a few of Laura’s old friends.
Laughingly, Laura declared, “My granddaughter’s boyfriend, isn’t he a fine young man?”
Sadie and Alex exchanged a look of mutual reluctant resignation, a silent communication filled with both amusement and a touch of distress.
“I’m sorry,” Sadie whispered to Alex, her apology tinged with embarrassment. “I mentioned to Grandma a few days ago that I’d bring my boyfriend over…”
Surprisingly, Alex took it more gracefully than she anticipated. With a gentle reassurance, he murmured, “It’s fine. Let her enjoy her misunderstanding for now. Anyway, you’ve…” He trailed off, but Sadie understood the implication.
Alex let out a weary sigh, his voice softening with concern. “If you ever need help, just let me know.”
Sadie had once been a vibrant part of their youthful social circle, her eyes shimmering with a bright, infectious spirit every time he met her. However, as the Hudson family fell from grace, she gradually faded from the gatherings that had once bound them together.
Over time, Sadie’s life took another unexpected turn as she became Noah’s wife.
“Sadie, I can finally rest easy now,” Laura murmured, gesturing for Sadie to take a seat, emotion flickering in her gaze.
In the cozy embrace of Laura’s apartment—a modest two-bedroom with an invitingly spacious living room—Alex didn’t feel his tall frame confined at all.
“Make sure to cherish each other and live well,” Laura remarked, her hands wrapped around theirs as she continued chatting.
Your favorite tales live at g?lnσν?s．
Sadie wanted to speak up, to explain everything, but watching her grandmother glow with happiness for the first time since her mother was gone, she chose to hold her tongue.
Later, sitting in Alex’s car, Sadie felt an awkwardness creeping in. “I hope you don’t mind—my grandma absolutely loves to chat. And thank you for everything today—seeing her this happy means a lot,” she said, her voice tinged with gratitude and relief.
Alex chuckled, his tone light. “Yeah, your grandmother is quite a character. I remember hearing tales of the strict ‘Iron Lady’ teacher back in elementary school, though I never had the chance to meet her.”
Their conversation flowed seamlessly until they reached Sadie’s apartment building.
As a gentleman, Alex escorted Sadie to the entrance of the building.
As she was about to express her thanks and head up the stairs, a sudden misstep caused her to twist her ankle, a sharp pain nearly drawing tears.
“What’s wrong? Are you hurt?” Alex’s concern was palpable as he quickly stepped forward to support her, ready to assist her upstairs.
But before they could take another step, an unexpected fist swung through the air, cutting the night with startling abruptness.
“Are you fucking insane, Noah?” Alex’s voice was sharp, his disbelief clear as he confronted Noah.noveldrama
Without thinking, he returned a punch, driven by a rush of anger. Noah, with reflexes quick as a whip, sidestepped, his eyes narrowing into slits as he fixed a piercing gaze on Alex. “Why are you with Sadie?”
“Well…” Alex started, his tone hesitant, but before he could stitch his words into an explanation, Sadie cut him off.

###Chapter 11:
“There’s no need to explain, Alex. I have nothing to do with him anymore,” she declared firmly, her voice tinged with finality. “Does it hurt? Do you need some medicine?”
Sadie’s concern was evident as she leaned closer, inspecting Alex’s face for injuries. Relief washed over her when she found none. The possibility of Alex getting hurt because of her filled her with a deep, unsettling guilt.
But for Noah, witnessing this tender exchange was like a match to kindling. A fierce blaze of jealousy ignited within him.
He reached out abruptly, grabbing Sadie’s wrist with a grip that was both sudden and forceful, and pulled her toward the elevator.
“What the hell are you doing? Let me go!” Sadie’s protest was sharp as she struggled against his hold, but her efforts were in vain.noveldrama
“Noah, calm down!” Alex stepped forward, his voice a mix of concern and command, attempting to defuse the escalating situation.
Yet, he was met with nothing but a chilling glare from Noah that made him halt in his tracks.
Noah’s anger didn’t wane as he dragged Sadie through the hallway to her apartment door.
Releasing her abruptly, he kicked the door open with such force that it swung wildly on its hinges, barely holding together.
Rubbing her wrist, Sadie glared at the damaged door, then turned her fiery gaze to Noah.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” she demanded, her voice rising with both anger and hurt.
“What’s wrong with me?” Noah echoed her words mockingly, his sneer sharp as broken glass. “Why are you with him?”
Noah’s sudden closeness, mixed with the intoxicating trace of his cologne, snapped Sadie back to reality.

“Are you following me?” Sadie’s voice carried a sharp sting as she narrowed her eyes menacingly.
Instead of giving an answer, Noah scoffed. “Why, feeling guilty?”
“Why should I feel guilty?” Sadie retorted with a sneer, her defiance clear. “We’re on the brink of divorce. Who I spend my time with is none of your business. Haven’t you moved on as well?”
“Divorce?” Noah’s voice dripped with disbelief, as if the idea was ludicrous. “Sadie, I’ve already told you—until those papers are signed, everything stays the same.” A chill spread through Sadie’s heart.
“Why the hell should I care about what you have to say?”
“Well.” Noah edged closer, his body pressing hers against the door, an unyielding barrier. “Because I’m still your husband!”
With those words, he claimed her lips in a fierce, punishing kiss.
His kiss was relentless—rough and demanding.
Sadie pushed against him with all her strength, but his arms remained locked around her.
“Noah, are you out of your damn mind?”
She managed to push him away and quickly ran her tongue over her swollen lips.
Noah’s eyes burned with an intensity that felt almost inescapable. “Sadie, you’re playing a dangerous game,” he murmured, his voice rough like gravel, his hand lingering possessively on her lower back. The air between them was charged, a silent acknowledgment of the storm that was about to break.
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat, a rush of emotion flooding her veins.
“Noah, come to your senses. You’re in love with Kyla. She’s back in your life, and yet, here you are, trying to hold on to me. What do you take me for?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 12:
Her voice quivered as she spoke, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.
The mention of Kyla seemed to jolt Noah out of his reverie.
He reached out, cradling Sadie’s face in his hand, his thumb tenderly wiping away her tears. His voice was a soft whisper, trying to soothe her. “Come on, let’s just go home.”
“Go home to what? To watch you play the devoted lover to her?” Sadie’s voice cracked, her resolve crumbling.
She stepped closer, her gaze locked onto his, a silent plea in her eyes.
“Noah, I’ve loved you unwaveringly for ten years! Yet, I’ve never had a place in your heart. I’ve sacrificed my dreams, my self-respect… I know I can’t demand your love, but do you really have to be this cruel? I hurt too, you know.”
Her tears cascaded down her cheeks, each drop reflecting her broken heart.
Noah, caught off-guard by her raw vulnerability, found himself at a loss.
A heavy weight seemed to press on his chest, stealing his breath.
“Sadie…”
His heart ached to console her, but no matter how hard he tried, the words refused to leave his lips.
“Noah, please, just leave. I can’t bear to look at you right now.” Sadie’s voice was laced with a palpable hurt. She turned her back to him, a clear dismissal.
Noah lingered, his gaze fixed on her rigid shoulders, the silence stretching painfully between them.
After a moment that felt like an eternity, he turned away, his footsteps echoing down the hall.
The sound of the door closing behind him felt final, a resolute click severing their ties.
Leaning against the wall, Sadie slid to the floor, her face buried in her knees as sobs wracked her body.
gα?ησν?s?com is where imagination thrives
The harsh truth settled in her heart; Noah would never truly grasp the depth of the pain he had inflicted on her.noveldrama
Outside, the crisp night air did little to clear Noah’s troubled thoughts. His phone rang, Kyla’s voice floating through with a teasing undertone. “Noah, can you spend the night with me, please?”
The fact that he hadn’t made a move on her was what unsettled her the most.
Despite her obvious intentions, Noah responded firmly, “Get some rest, Kyla. We’ll talk at the office tomorrow.”
“But Noah…”
Kyla’s voice was a mix of disappointment and persistence.
“I’m driving right now. We’ll catch up later,” Noah interjected, ending the call briskly.
On the other end, Kyla’s eyes narrowed, the message from the private investigator she had hired burning in her mind. A dangerous plan was forming.
The following morning, upon arrival at the office, Sadie was immediately met with curious glances and whispered murmurs from her colleagues.
Her connection with them paid off when one of them pulled her aside and whispered, “Sadie, you should see what’s been sent to the company group chat.”
Trepidation gripped Sadie as she lifted her phone. Among the flood of messages, she found the anonymous email—images that captured moments between her and Noah, and shockingly, one with Alex.
As whispers swirled around her, Sadie felt the sting of each word like a slap. Colleagues she barely interacted with were painting her as the villain in a scandalous love triangle, labeling her a seductress and side chick. The comments were biting, filled with contempt.
Grateful for the heads-up, Sadie gave a quick thanks and wasted no time heading straight to Samuel.

###Chapter 13:
“Samuel, can you take care of this? I can’t have my personal life disrupt my professional environment,” she implored, her voice steady yet edged with urgency.
Knowing exactly who she was, Samuel made sure to treat her with the respect she deserved.
“I’ve already silenced the group chat. We’ll wait for Mr. Wall’s guidance on how to proceed,” he assured her, his demeanor composed but sympathetic to her plight.
Keeping Sadie’s identity as his wife hidden had always been part of Noah’s plan.
Though he understood Sadie’s situation, Samuel, bound by his position, dared not intervene.
Trying to maintain her composure, Sadie nodded and excused herself, her facade uncracked as she moved through the office towards the break room.
There, she encountered the last thing she needed—a group of usual detractors, casually tossing around their latest speculations about her.
“Who would have thought the quiet and reserved Sadie had such a scandalous side?”
“Right? Just look at her—trouble from the start. It’s clear she’s not as innocent as she seems.”
“And bold enough to play the seductress right under the real girlfriend’s nose. She’s cunning, I’ll give her that.”
Sadie tried to steady her trembling hand around her cup.
The irony twisted deep into her heart—she, the legitimate wife, now misjudged as the other woman.
Unable to correct the narrative without exposing more of her private life, she took a deep, steadying breath, steeling herself against the slander.
“Sadie!”
g ? ln σ ν s?com, your fiction escape
She was about to walk away when a familiar voice called her name, stopping her in her tracks.
“What’s wrong? Feeling upset?” Kyla’s voice dripped with a taunting smugness as she sauntered closer.
The white dress she donned today only amplified her deceptively innocent allure, making her seem as pristine as a freshly bloomed lily.
Sadie stopped dead in her tracks, her gaze turning frosty as she met Kyla’s eyes. “Was it you?” she demanded, her voice a mix of disbelief and accusation.
The thought of Kyla slandering her was incomprehensible.
Didn’t she fear that Noah might just expose their marriage?
Kyla’s lips curled into a sly smile, and instead of a straightforward answer, she leaned closer, her whisper laced with contempt. “I heard you’ve been in love with Noah for a decade, but funny thing—he’s been in love with me just as long. So, tell me, when push comes to shove, do you think he’ll side with you at the brink of a divorce, or will he just discard you like a used-up toy?”
A laugh, bitter and incredulous, escaped Sadie. She fixed Kyla with a steely look. “Are you so certain he’ll choose you? I’ve shared his bed for two years. Do you honestly believe his desires mean nothing?”
Sadie knew Noah had never truly been intimate with Kyla, at least not before he confessed as much to her.
“You—”
Kyla’s face twisted with hurt and anger. Her hand flew up, poised to strike, but a sudden glimpse of a familiar black suit in her peripheral vision made her hesitate.
Quickly masking her fury with a look of feigned sorrow, she lowered her hand and sighed, “It’s not Noah’s fault—it’s all on me. Coming back was a mistake.”noveldrama
“What bullshit did you just say, Sadie?” Noah’s voice suddenly cut through the tension.
He strode into the room just as Kyla’s words reached his ears. His gaze, heavy with disapproval, landed on Sadie.

###Chapter 14:
She returned his look with a frosty silence before turning sharply and exiting the break room.
The wave of emotions surging through her was too much to bear; her stomach twisted into knots, compelling her to gag.
Stumbling into the restroom, Sadie leaned over the sink, her body convulsing as she retched, each heave leaving her more lightheaded than the last.
“Sadie!” Noah called out, his voice echoing slightly off the restroom tiles.
He had seen her storm away with such resolve that he couldn’t shake the feeling something was terribly wrong. His instincts had guided him here, to find her in distress.
She was sick, and it was more serious than he had realized.
Sadie’s recent mood swings suddenly made sense to him, but she remained oblivious to his thoughts, her mind screaming for solitude.
In her desperation, Sadie retched even more, and she couldn’t get a word out. She could only weakly wave her hand, signaling him to leave.
Noah’s expression darkened with worry, and without hesitating, he reached for her trembling hand.
“You’re not okay! Let me take you to the hospital!” he declared, his voice a blend of command and concern, leaving no space for her to argue.
As she slowly regained some composure, the last thing Sadie wanted was for Noah to uncover her pregnancy.
Pulling her hand away, she responded in a strained voice, “I’m fine. Probably just some bad food, no big deal. Mr. Wall, please, a little decency—we’re nearly divorced!” Her words seemed to float past Noah, who was focused on the gleaming cleanliness of the sink.
Sadie didn’t vomit anything. Was she really pregnant? No, that couldn’t be.
He was meticulous, always cautious with timings and protection. The very thought seemed ludicrous.
gα?ησνs?com has your next chapter
Just then, his phone shattered the silence, its ring slicing through the tension like a knife. The call was from Kyla.noveldrama
“Noah, where are you? You disappeared without a word! There’s an important contract waiting for you. Can you come and take a look?”
Noah’s eyes flickered to Sadie, who managed a weak, reassuring smile.
“No need to delay business for my sake, Mr. Wall.”
“Take care of yourself,” Noah muttered, pocketing his phone and reluctantly turning to leave.
Sadie’s gaze followed him until he was out of sight, her legs buckling beneath her as she collapsed to the floor, gasping for air.
A sense of urgency washed over her. She couldn’t waste any more time—she had to get divorced and walk away soon.
If she stayed, if Noah ever discovered the child’s existence, it would all be too late.
Sadie took a deep breath, her heart pounding like a drum in her chest.
The taxi driver caught a glimpse of her pale face in the rearview mirror. His brow furrowed with concern as he asked, “Miss, are you alright? Should I take you to the hospital?”
“No, thank you,” Sadie replied, her voice barely above a whisper as she forced a feeble smile.
The very thought of the hospital sent a chill through her bones. It was too dangerous. Going there could unravel her secret.
The sudden ring of her phone cut through the silence, making her heart skip a beat.
The call was from Noah.
The sight of his name on the display sent a jolt of fear through her. Her heart stumbled over its next beat. She was torn between dread and the urge to disappear. 
.

###Chapter 15:
With a hand that shook slightly, Sadie hesitated, then pressed the answer button.
“Hello…” Her greeting was timid, laced with a hoarseness born of her anxiety.
“Sadie, where on earth are you?” Noah’s voice came through, icy and sharp with anger.
Clutching the phone with both hands now, Sadie tried to steady her voice. “I—I’m heading home.”
“Get back here right now—we’re going to the hospital!” With a commanding edge in his voice, Noah made it clear—this wasn’t up for debate.
Going to the hospital?
The very idea sent a shiver down Sadie’s spine—she couldn’t possibly.
But something in Noah’s tone hinted at concern, sparking a tiny flame of hope in her chest.
With her heart pounding, Sadie ventured, her voice barely audible, “Are you… worried about me?”noveldrama
But before Noah could answer, a sugary, flirtatious voice cut through the silence, dripping with intimacy.
“Our friends are hosting a party for me tonight, Noah. I’d love it if you came with me.”
Kyla’s voice was sweet, yet her words crashed down like a steel fist, snuffing out Sadie’s lingering hope.
A vice tightened around Sadie’s heart, the agony breathtaking.
How naive she had been!
A bitter chuckle escaped her as she realized the truth. Noah’s concern wasn’t for her well-being; he was simply worried she might be pregnant—a complication for him and Kyla.
Unable to bear another second, Sadie abruptly ended the call.
Tears betrayed her composure, cascading freely down her cheeks.
She clamped a hand over her mouth, muffling the heart-wrenching sobs that threatened to overwhelm her.
A flicker of Sadie’s reflection in the rearview mirror caught the driver’s eye, prompting a soft, thoughtful sigh. He remained silent, the only sound the soft hum of the engine as he pressed down on the accelerator with deliberate heaviness.
Sadie, leaning against the cool window, watched the world blur past. A deep, throbbing ache filled her chest, her heart squeezed by the relentless grip of realization.
She had once believed that two years of marriage would at least forge some semblance of sincerity, even if love remained elusive.
But now, faced with the stark truth, she realized how stupid she had been.
Noah had only harbored disdain, cloaked in the guise of indifference, while she—foolishly, hopelessly—had clung to a fraying thread of hope.
Self-pity washed over her as she allowed the tears to escape, tracing wet paths down her cheeks, mourning the love she had imagined.
Meanwhile, Noah stood firmly as he addressed Kyla’s request. “No, I have plans for tonight,” he stated flatly, his voice a mix of resolve and detachment.
Kyla’s eyes momentarily lost their sparkle, her smile waning slightly, but she nodded with a feigned understanding, her voice tinged with disappointment. “I see. Alright then.”
Her fingers delicately gripped her purse as she turned to leave. Noah’s gaze lingered on Kyla’s retreating figure, his eyes shadowed with a complex, unspoken turmoil.
After she had gone, he reached for his phone, intending to ask Sadie what she had said earlier.

###Chapter 16:noveldrama
But as he saw the dark screen, he realized the call had ended long ago. The phone’s screen reflected his darkening expression.
Frustration boiled inside him as he flung the phone onto the table, unable to make sense of the emotions churning within him.
“Damn it!” Noah grumbled through clenched teeth.
Just then, the soft murmur of whispers slipped through the thin walls of his office.
“Did you see the pictures? Sadie was getting cozy with two men at the same time.”
“Is that so? That’s hard to believe. She’s always seemed so upright and polished to me.”
“Well, appearances can be deceiving, can’t they?”
As these snippets of conversation reached his ears, Noah’s face clouded over, a storm brewing in his eyes.
With a sudden, forceful motion, he flung the office door open, his eyes piercing as they swept over the group of gossiping women outside. His voice sliced through the air, icy and sharp.
“Don’t you all have actual work to do?”
The women blanched, a wave of fear washing over them as they lowered their heads, hardly daring to draw breath.
“Mr. Wall, we’re truly sorry. It won’t happen again!”
Noah gave a dismissive snort, his silence as condemning as any words. Turning on his heel, he retreated back into the sanctuary of his office. Even when he was back at his desk, his anger continued to simmer, barely contained.
He snatched up the phone and dialed a number.
“Samuel, get over here. Now.”

Samuel knocked lightly on the door before stepping inside.
“Is there something you need, Mr. Wall?”
“What’s the deal with those pictures?” Noah’s voice cut through the air, a hint of barely contained rage threading through his words.
Samuel hesitated for a moment, his mind racing to catch up with Noah’s query. Realization flickered in his eyes, and he quickly composed himself.
“I only just found out about this matter myself, sir, and I was on my way to inform you.”
He extended his phone towards Noah.
“I’ve sent the photos to your phone as well.”
Noah accepted the phone with a swift motion, his gaze narrowing as he scrutinized the image displayed.
It was him and Sadie in the picture. The background left no doubt—it had been taken covertly from outside Sadie’s apartment building. In the photo, Sadie clung to him tightly, her posture tender, while he gazed down at her, their closeness undeniably intimate.
A shadow passed over Noah’s face, his brow knitting together as his eyes turned stormy and impenetrable.
Observing Noah’s troubled expression, Samuel tread carefully.
“Mr. Wall, should we take this opportunity to make your marriage—”
“No need.” Noah cut him off sharply, his voice resonating with authority.
“I don’t care how—just figure out who took those photos and who posted them online.”
He tossed the phone onto the desk with a clatter, the haunting image of Sadie’s ghostly, distraught face lingering in his mind.
As the finality of their divorce loomed, he desperately wished to avoid any more complications.

###Chapter 17:
With a small nod, Samuel responded in a calm, respectful tone, “Understood, Mr. Wall.”
Meanwhile, Sadie dragged herself through her front door, her body heavy with exhaustion.
She collapsed onto the sofa, rummaging through her bag for her phone. The bright screen flared to life, causing her to squint against the harsh light.
Her attention was quickly captured by Kyla’s latest Instagram post—a black Bentley parked under the soft glow of streetlights, its license plate familiar, stabbing at her heart with a sharp pang of recognition. In the photo, Kyla was the picture of contentment, her makeup impeccable and her smile gentle, as she playfully flashed a peace sign at the camera.
The caption beneath the photo struck even deeper.
“I told him it was late, and next thing I knew, he was driving across the city to get me.”
Those words sliced through Sadie’s heart with cruel precision.
Indeed, Noah had chosen to be with Kyla.
A wave of nausea overwhelmed her as her vision blurred and her stomach twisted violently.
Clamping a hand over her mouth, Sadie stumbled to the bathroom, her other hand bracing against the wall as she lurched forward, succumbing to her sickness and retching miserably into the toilet.
But no matter how hard Sadie gagged, only the bitter taste filled her mouth.
Overwhelmed, she slumped against the wall, sliding helplessly to the floor as tears cascaded down her cheeks.noveldrama
Her heart was shattered, each shard throbbing with a deep, relentless pain.
She had braced herself for the divorce, believing she was prepared. Yet, the instant she glimpsed Kyla’s latest post, the harsh reality hit her—she had completely overestimated her tolerance.
Your new favorite is gα?ησν?s?c?m
On the glaring phone screen, Kyla’s smug expression seemed to mock her, taunting her frailty and her misplaced confidence.
Sadie’s fingers whitened around her phone, her grip tightening with resolve.
She couldn’t stomach another second with that scumbag.
A divorce was the only way to rid herself of his bullshit.
This conviction swelled within her, filling every corner of her mind, leaving no room for rest.
That night, sleep eluded her entirely.
The next morning, Sadie dragged herself out of bed, the toll of the night evident in the dark circles branding her under-eyes.
Her reflection in the mirror was ashen, the very image of exhaustion. She reached for her makeup bag, attempting to mask the signs of her sleepless night with layers of foundation.
Yet, no amount of cosmetics could veil the profound exhaustion and despair that had seeped into her very bones.
That insufferable post from Kyla was all it took—Sadie’s last bit of restraint snapped like a brittle thread.
It dawned on her with painful clarity that some things were simply beyond redemption, no matter how fervently she wished otherwise.
Drawing in a steadying breath, Sadie placed the compact on the table with a soft click.
Divorce was her only option now.
It was time to forge a new path—for her own sake and for the unborn child she nurtured within her.
As she walked into the office, Sadie’s day took an immediate downturn as she stumbled upon Kyla.

###Chapter 18:
Their encounter felt like the universe’s cruel joke.
Clad in a pale yellow dress that accentuated her porcelain-like skin, Kyla epitomized deceptive innocence.
But behind that seemingly harmless facade, Sadie was keenly aware of the conniving spirit that dwelled.
“Hello, Sadie,” Kyla began, her voice dripping with feigned concern, a mocking smile curling her lips. “You look absolutely worn out. Didn’t get much sleep, did you?”
Sadie’s hand instinctively clenched into a tight fist, a sharp pain lancing through her palm.noveldrama
She remained silent, casting a frosty glare at Kyla before trying to brush past her.
Kyla’s voice spiked with deliberate provocation as she called out, “Well, yeah. Any woman would be restless if they knew their man was in another woman’s bed, wouldn’t they?” Her words echoed with malice.
Stopping dead in her tracks, Sadie lifted her head abruptly, her eyes blazing as she met Kyla’s challenging gaze.
Rage blazed inside her, searing through her like wildfire.
“So what?” she hissed, her words slicing through the tense air like shards of ice. “In the end, you’re nothing but a pathetic mistress.”
For a fleeting moment, Kyla’s confident smile wavered, but she quickly masked her momentary doubt.
Leaning in close, she whispered into Sadie’s ear, her voice a venomous hiss only the two of them could hear, “Talk all you want, but at the end of the day, it’s Noah’s feelings that decide everything.”
A chill ran down Sadie’s spine, a foreboding feeling washing over her. Kyla’s words struck like a dagger, twisting deep in her heart.
She couldn’t bring herself to dwell on what Noah might be thinking or the disaster that could follow.

As Kyla observed Sadie’s complexion turn ghostly pale, her lips curled into a smug smile.
This was precisely the reaction she sought—to see Sadie tormented, pushed to the brink of despair, compelled to retreat.
Brushing off the confrontation with a dismissive flick of her wrist, Kyla declared, “I have things to do, so I’ll be off.”
She then turned sharply and walked away, her heels clicking ominously against the hard floor.
Sadie sank into her chair, a whirlwind of emotions leaving her unsettled.
The moment she walked into the office, an awkward silence settled over her colleagues, their eyes darting away as if that could undo the whispers from before.
Distracted by the whirlwind of her thoughts, Sadie barely registered the shift in the office’s mood.
It wasn’t until a colleague—nervous and fidgety—made her way to her desk that Sadie snapped back to reality. With a hesitant cough, the colleague seemed to struggle with words, her discomfort palpable in the thick air.
“What’s going on here?” Sadie’s voice cut through the silence, her brow furrowed in concern.
The office felt suddenly smaller as her colleagues exchanged uneasy looks. Finally, one of them stepped forward, her face flushed with embarrassment. “Sadie, we owe you an apology,” she said, unable to meet Sadie’s eyes.
“We got it all wrong. We shouldn’t have jumped to conclusions,” another colleague said.
“We thought that you and Mr. Wall… well, that you were the other woman…”
“It was wrong of us to assume without knowing the whole story. Please forgive us.” 
.

###Chapter 19:
Sadie’s mouth fell open in shock. “What happened?” she asked, her voice tinged with disbelief.
“You should check the group chat,” a colleague said, pointing towards Sadie’s computer with a sheepish expression.
As Sadie turned to her screen, a cautious hope began to bubble inside her. Could it be that Noah had made their marriage public?
Was he ready to embrace their relationship openly, to declare their bond to the world?
Heart pounding with a mix of nerves and urgency, Sadie started her computer, clicking into the work group chat without hesitation. For a brief, hopeful second, her lips curved into a tentative smile.
But it faltered, then froze entirely.
The pinned message wasn’t the happy announcement she had longed for.
Instead, it was a somber clarification.
Her eyes scanned the lines quickly; they were penned by a colleague from the marketing department, one with whom she had previously clashed. The colleague confessed to having taken those photos with the sole intent of tarnishing Sadie’s reputation.
An official notice from the company swiftly followed, denouncing the colleague’s actions and imposing a strict penalty, while also issuing a stern warning against the spread of rumors.
So, it wasn’t what she had thought.
Disappointment crashed over Sadie like a cold wave, leaving a sting as if she had been slapped hard across the face. The sensation seared her, sinking claws deep into her flesh.
“Talk all you want, but at the end of the day, it’s Noah’s feelings that decide everything.” Kyla’s words haunted her, tightening around her heart like a steel vice.
Was it possible? Noah preferred pinning the blame on an innocent colleague rather than making their marriage public, simply to shield Kyla from the scandal of being the other woman?

Sadie’s hands balled into fists at her sides, her nails digging crescents into her palms. Yet, she felt numb to the physical pain.
The ache in her heart dwarfed any physical discomfort, a deep, throbbing wound far more grievous than any cut could ever be. The realization pierced her heart like a shard of ice, chilling and sharp, drawing forth a silent, seething agony.
Sadie had given everything to this marriage, putting her own dreams on hold just to stand by Noah’s side, unseen but unwavering.noveldrama
Yet, this was her bitter reward.
A hollow laugh escaped her lips, tinged with the taste of disillusionment.
As the sun dipped below the horizon and the office buzz dwindled to a hushed stillness, Sadie lingered at her desk, lost in thought. The soft luminescence of her computer screen cast ghostly shadows across her features, underscoring the turmoil within.
She marveled numbly at her ability to endure the day—each sidelong glance and hushed murmur from her colleagues felt like a blade twisting in her already wounded heart.
She had believed herself resilient, armored against the slings and arrows of fate. But the harsh light of truth unveiled her fragility, a delicate glass figure on the verge of shattering.
“Sadie, why are you still here?”
The sudden intrusion of a familiar voice jolted her from her reverie. It was Tina Delgado, a beacon of kindness in the often indifferent sea of their corporate world.
“I’m just… trying to wrap my head around the new project,” Sadie replied, mustering a feeble smile to mask her inner chaos.

###Chapter 20:
Tina eyed Sadie with concern, her brows knitting together. “Work’s still on your mind even now? You really should take it easy and rest,” she advised softly. “Come on, let’s go home together.”
“No, I still have a few things to wrap up,” Sadie responded, her voice tinged with exhaustion.
She craved some solitude, a moment to untangle her thoughts. After Tina’s departure, Sadie lingered in the quiet office for a while before she finally stood to leave.
Outside, darkness had enveloped the city. Despite the vibrant lights and the incessant hum of traffic, a sharp pang of loneliness sliced through her.
She meandered through the streets, the sharp click of her heels on the pavement echoing around her. The fading light of the sunset stretched her shadow long and thin across the ground.
Suddenly, the harsh screech of brakes rang out near her, and an unseen force slammed into her, sending her crashing to the sidewalk. A jolt of pain seared through her ankle, drawing a sharp gasp from her lips.
“Are you blind? Watch where you’re going!” The voice came from a young man perched on a motorcycle, his hair dyed a striking shade of yellow. He glared down at her, his black leather jacket catching the dim light.
Gritting her teeth against the pain, Sadie attempted to rise, her hands trembling.noveldrama
“This day is an absolute train wreck,” the young man grumbled, his voice dripping with disdain as he revved his engine and sped off into the night.
Sadie sat on the chilly pavement, her tears carving wet trails down her cheeks. She felt completely forsaken, as if the world had turned its back on her. Her ankle pulsed with a sharp, insistent pain. She reached for her phone, her heart sinking as she realized the battery was dead.
At that moment, the purr of an engine drew her attention. A black Bentley glided to a stop before her, its presence almost surreal in the dim streetlight.
The window descended smoothly, revealing a man with striking features and an air of unmistakable elegance—it was Noah.
gα?ησν?s?com has stories worth exploring
What the hell was he doing here?
Sadie’s mind raced, her heart fluttering with a mix of dread and unexpected hope.
“Get in,” Noah commanded, his voice deep and compelling, resonating with a familiar authority that sent shivers down Sadie’s spine.
As Sadie hesitated, her thoughts flashed to Kyla’s recent Instagram post—the very car Noah was driving now had been used to escort Kyla just the night before.
Could he be here for Kyla again?
The possibility stung, sending a wave of sorrow through her already fragile emotions.
With a defiant bite of her lip, she turned her head away, unwilling to let Noah see the vulnerability in her eyes.
“I said, get in,” Noah repeated, his impatience tinged with a sharper edge.
Taking a deep, steadying breath, Sadie pushed herself to her feet, her injured ankle protesting as she limped slightly.
“That won’t be necessary, Mr. Wall. I can manage on my own,” she declared, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside.
Whatever they had was over—she wanted him out of her life for good. But after just a few steps, a tight grip locked around her wrist, stopping her in her tracks.
She glanced back—Noah had left the car and wasn’t letting her go. His imposing figure loomed, his voice carrying a quiet hint of annoyance. “Sadie, what’s the drama about this time?”
A pang of sorrow tightened around Sadie’s heart.
Jerking her hand away, she straightened her posture and masked her pain with a veneer of cool detachment. “You really think too highly of yourself, don’t you? We’re getting divorced, and the last thing I need is any drama that might confuse your precious sweetheart.” 
.

.
###Chapter 21:
Noah’s expression faltered, a trace of discomfort flashing across his features.
“It’s late, and it’s not safe for you to walk home alone. Kyla would understand; she won’t get the wrong idea.”
So, he acknowledged that Kyla was his precious sweetheart. The ache in Sadie’s chest grew until it was nearly unbearable.
With a forceful twist, Sadie freed her wrist and pivoted sharply to walk away.
The pain from her earlier injury was momentarily forgotten until she misstepped.
Her ankle buckled under her weight, and a sharp cry of pain escaped her lips as she stumbled. “Ah!”
Sadie tumbled gracelessly onto the cold ground. Instantly, Noah’s face twisted with concern, and he hastened to her side with long, urgent strides, sweeping her into his arms effortlessly.
“Let me down! I can manage on my own!” Sadie insisted, her voice thick with defiance as she wriggled in his grasp.
But Noah was unyielding. With a determined grip, he carried her to the black Bentley parked nearby. He settled her gently into the passenger seat, securing the seatbelt around her with a click that echoed her confinement, before slipping behind the wheel.
The Bentley sliced through the night, its engine a low growl against the silence. Outside, the landscape merged into a blur of shadows and fleeting lights, reflecting Sadie’s tumultuous emotions. She peered out, feeling adrift in a sea of confusion.
They navigated into an upscale residential area, the car’s headlights casting eerie shadows until they halted in front of a grand villa.
Sadie’s eyes widened in shock and a flicker of nostalgia. It was their former shared home.
Noah’s movements were tender yet firm as he carried Sadie into the living room and eased her onto the plush sofa. His brow furrowed as he observed her swollen ankle, his concern palpable in the quiet space.
Feeling uneasy, Sadie instinctively tried to retract her foot, but Noah gripped it firmly.
“Don’t move,” he commanded, his voice a blend of firmness and underlying warmth, leaving no room for protest.
Sadie’s heart fluttered with unease as she followed the instruction. With a swift motion, Noah pulled out his phone and promptly dialed a number.
The urgency in his voice was unmistakable as he stated sharply, “Jim, you have thirty minutes to make it to the Myrtlewood Estate.”noveldrama
On the other end, a groggy Jim Archer struggled to gather his wits. He attempted to ask a question, but Noah briskly cut him off and ended the call.
With a heavy sigh of resignation, Jim reluctantly swung his legs out of bed. As he dressed in the dim light of his bedroom, he grumbled under his breath, “It’s the dead of night. Why can’t these emergencies ever wait until morning?”
But he knew all too well that when Noah called, refusal wasn’t an option—not when his $200,000 monthly salary came from a man as powerful as Noah.
Half an hour later, Jim arrived at the estate, his hair tousled and his eyes bleary. He briefly vented his frustration to Noah before turning his attention to Sadie’s injury.
Examining her carefully, he concluded, “This ankle sprain is quite severe. You’ll need to stay off it and rest for a few days.”
His skilled hands were gently securing a bandage around her swollen ankle.
“Thank you, Dr. Archer,” Sadie murmured, her attention fixed on the throbbing ache in her ankle.
Jim waved off her gratitude with a casual flick of his wrist. “Oh, it’s nothing. With what your husband pays, it’s the least I can do.” His tone held a hint of cynicism that didn’t go unnoticed. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 22:
At the mention of “your husband,” Sadie felt a sharp sting of bitterness surge through her. She managed a strained smile, masking the turmoil that the phrase evoked within her.
Jim had just finished tending to Sadie’s injury when he sought out Noah to discuss some necessary precautions. As he relayed the information, his gaze occasionally drifted toward Sadie, whose distant expression tugged at his curiosity.
Something about the evening’s atmosphere felt unsettlingly amiss.
Jim leaned closer to Noah under the guise of confidentiality, his voice dropping to a whisper. “Did you and your wife have a fight? She seems a bit… distant tonight.”
Noah paused, a shadow crossing his features. After a moment, he responded in a hushed tone, barely audible, “I’m planning to divorce her.”
Shock flickered across Jim’s face as he stared at Noah, his eyes wide with disbelief.
The silence stretched between them, heavy and uncomfortable. Observing Noah’s stern countenance, devoid of any humor, Jim let out a heavy sigh, tinged with regret.
“It’s your choice,” he finally said, his voice low and somber as he began to pack up his medical kit. “Just don’t do something you’ll wish you could take back.”
Noah, taken aback, felt a stab of irritation.
Why did everyone assume regret would follow his decision? Didn’t they understand? The love of his life had finally returned to him. He remained silent, lost in his thoughts, not fully grasping that some choices, once made, were irrevocable.
As Jim zipped up his kit, he turned to Sadie, offering her a gentle smile. “Take care, and try to get some rest,” he advised softly, his tone laced with concern. “I’ll be on my way.”
At his words, Sadie’s head snapped up, her eyes locking onto his with a desperate sharpness, as if she were grasping at a lifeline in a stormy sea.
Sadie knew seizing this moment was crucial for her escape.
“Wait, Dr. Archer!” she exclaimed suddenly, determination lighting her eyes. “I’m coming with you.”
She scrambled to slip back into her shoes, fumbling and hopping on one foot in her haste to catch up to Jim.
“Hey, slow down there!” Jim called out, surprised. He extended his hand to steady her, his eyes wide with concern.
As she made for the door, Sadie stumbled yet again, her foot twisting awkwardly.
“Ow…” she muttered, grimacing as a sharp pain shot through her. Tears threatened to spill from her eyes, but she blinked them back fiercely. The only thing on her mind was getting out.
She just needed to escape, away from this suffocating place.
Just then, Noah snapped out of his reverie, catching the tail end of her frantic movements. His heart clenched with worry, propelling him forward. He reached her just in time to prevent another fall.
“Sadie!” he bellowed in anger. “I told you to rest, and here you are, disregarding your own health! Are you trying to worsen your injury?” His voice was thick with worry and frustration, his brow furrowed as he looked at her intently.
Sadie blinked at him, caught off guard by the sudden flare of anger in his eyes.
As Jim realized his presence was unnecessary, he silently retreated, melting into the shadows.
Noah scooped Sadie up in his arms, and she was immediately enveloped by the comforting, familiar scent of him—a scent that evoked memories of intimate nights they had once shared.
Despite the warmth of his embrace, Sadie was keenly aware that soon, he would no longer be hers. noveldrama

###Chapter 23:
The realization sent a sharp ache through her heart, prompting her to wriggle desperately, trying to escape his hold.
“Let me go! I can walk on my own!” she asserted defiantly, her voice laced with frustration.
Her vigorous struggle irked Noah, and in response, he tightened his grip, his resolve firm.
“And risk you hurting your foot again?” He chided her softly, his voice a blend of reprimand and tenderness.
Sadie’s resistance faded; she reluctantly ceased her efforts and settled down.
Noah’s gaze softened as he looked upon her calm, delicate features, stirring a storm of emotions within him.
He carefully lowered her onto the sofa, his movements tender and deliberate, and he knelt to examine her swollen ankle.
His fingers, articulate and precise, brushed against her skin with a gentleness that contrasted with his earlier firmness.
Sadie cast her gaze downward, her eyes settling on the crown of Noah’s head, momentarily adrift in thought.
These instances of tenderness from Noah were few and far between.
Every gesture he made seemed to strum a chord deep within her heart. Once Noah confirmed her ankle was fine, he carefully placed her feet on the sofa and draped a blanket over them with a soft touch.
“You haven’t had anything to eat yet, have you? I’ll whip up some clam chowder to fill you up,” he offered, his voice soft and filled with concern.
At his words, a surge of warmth fluttered through Sadie’s chest. She raised her eyes to meet his, her gaze lingering on his striking features, rendered speechless.
She meant to insist that it wasn’t necessary, yet before the words could leave her lips, Noah said firmly, “Just relax,” and made his way to the kitchen.
g?lnσνs?c?m is a world of wonder
The kitchen’s open layout allowed Sadie a clear view from the sofa. She watched as Noah rolled up his sleeves, exposing his muscular, well-toned forearms.
The way he chopped ingredients was pure artistry—fluid, precise, and nearly enchanting to watch.
Sadie’s thoughts swirled in chaos—she just couldn’t make sense of him. They were on the brink of divorce; why then did Noah continue to perform these thoughtful, intimate acts that only fueled her confusion?
Before she could delve too deep into her thoughts, Noah returned, setting a steaming bowl of clam chowder before her with a gesture that suggested she enjoy it while it was hot.noveldrama
The enticing aroma of the clam chowder wafted through the air, but to Sadie, it was more of an assault than a comfort, making her stomach twist in revolt. She instinctively clapped a hand over her mouth, her eyes widening as she fought the urge to gag.
Noah’s brow furrowed in concern. “What’s wrong?” he asked, his voice laced with worry.
Sadie shook her head and mustered a feeble smile. “Nothing, just not feeling very hungry,” she responded, hoping her voice sounded convincing enough. She desperately wanted to keep her discomfort hidden from Noah, to mask the turmoil that churned within her.
Noah’s expression softened, though his concern didn’t wane. “Sadie, it’s your own body,” he reminded her gently, his voice tinged with a mix of exasperation and tenderness. “You know about your stomach issues. If you don’t eat on time, you’re the one who’s going to suffer later.”
His words were firm, underscored by a palpable sense of concern that seemed to fill the room.
Sadie felt a sudden pinch at her nose, and before she could stop them, tears began to stream down her cheeks. Memories flooded back—of years ago when she first started working at Noah’s company, of the countless nights spent toiling away, skipping meals in a vain attempt to gain his approval. It was during one of those grueling nights that her neglect had caught up with her, her stomach condition flaring up so severely that she had collapsed and curled in on herself on the floor, pain clouding her vision. In her haze, she vaguely remembered being lifted, carried with a steadiness that had felt strangely comforting at the time. 
.

.
###Chapter 24:
When she had come to, it was to find Noah by her bedside, his face etched with worry as he gently offered her water and medication.
“It’s your own body. Don’t treat it so poorly.”
Though his tone had been calm at the time, it etched itself into her memory. Those words had spurred her to take better care of herself, ensuring she ate regularly, no matter the circumstances. What once felt comforting now sliced through her, leaving an aching wound.
Noah observed Sadie, who was gazing vacantly at the floor, seemingly lost in a world of her own. Minutes ticked by without a single change in her expression. He knitted his brows, concern slowly morphing into irritation. Just as he was about to confront Sadie, she lurched forward, her movements abrupt as she seized the bowl and scooped a spoonful of clam chowder into her mouth.
The soup’s robust seafood flavor bombarded her senses immediately, too potent for her liking. Her face contorted in disgust as her stomach revolted against the taste. With a swift motion, she set the bowl aside and brushed past Noah, hopping on one foot as she rushed toward the bathroom.
Her fingers dug into the toilet seat as she bent over, vomiting until nothing was left. Noah lingered at the doorway, his initial annoyance fading into a shadow of concern as he watched her trembling form. He stepped closer, tentatively extending a hand to comfort her, but she slapped it away with a weak, yet determined, gesture.
“Sadie…”
“Don’t touch me!” Sadie’s voice was ragged, strained from the force of her retching.
Noah halted, his hand suspended in the air, his features clouding over with a mix of hurt and confusion.noveldrama
“Let me take you to the hospital,” he hastily suggested.
“No!” The refusal came sharp and instinctive from Sadie as she braced herself against the cool bathroom wall, her arms protectively wrapped around her abdomen. Her eyes, filled with a mix of fear and defiance, locked onto his.
The air between them thickened with unspoken words, and Noah’s suspicions crept back into his mind, the idea that she might be hiding a pregnancy gnawing at him. His eyes narrowed, the weight of his fears and frustrations making his next words heavy and resolute.
“You don’t get to decide this time!”
His voice was unyielding, shutting down any chance of protest. Just as Noah was about to step forward and scoop Sadie up, his phone erupted into a jarring ring. The name “Kyla” flashed urgently across the screen.
Without a second thought, Noah answered. Kyla’s voice, soft and frail, seeped through the receiver.
“Noah… Something feels off with my heart… I think my old condition is flaring up again. Can you come get me and take me to the hospital?” There was a soft, nasal sweetness to Kyla’s voice, making it hard not to feel for her.
Noah’s eyes darted towards Sadie. She sat curled up in the corner, her posture reminiscent of a kitten deprived of safety, her arms wrapped tightly around herself.
Her pallid face, lips pressed into a thin line, and eyes brimming with unease and defensiveness painted a picture of vulnerability that could soften the hardest heart.
A wave of discomfort washed over Noah, causing his grip on the phone to tighten. He found himself caught in a moment of deep hesitation, torn between two calls for his attention.
Kyla’s voice, threaded with a hint of fragility, broke the silence once again, followed by two soft coughs.
“Well, if it’s too much trouble for you, that’s okay. After all, it’s quite late. I can wait until tomorrow to see a doctor. It’s not urgent.” Her words were polite but carried an unspoken accusation of neglect, wrapped in quiet endurance.
Noah felt as though an invisible fist had clenched around his heart. His earlier hesitation melted away instantly. “I’ll be right there,” he declared, his voice firm, offering no room for doubt.

###Chapter 25:
Hastily, he strode out of the bathroom, the sound of his footsteps fading away, followed by the decisive click of the door closing behind him.
In the now-quiet room, Sadie’s tension unraveled suddenly.
She sat on the cold floor, clutching her stomach tightly.
Although she had anticipated this outcome, a sharp pang of pain still shot through her heart.
In Kyla’s shadow, she felt endlessly sidelined, like nothing more than a disposable —cherished only when needed, then carelessly cast aside.
Despite it all, she clung to a foolish sliver of hope, hoping that perhaps, one day, her presence might mean more.
With an empty, aching stomach from skipping dinner and earlier bouts of nausea, Sadie managed a rueful grin.
She braced herself against the wall, awkwardly hopping on one foot as she made her way outside.
Determination etched her features. She had to step away from it all—resign, leave Noah, and never look back.noveldrama
The stiff sofa and biting cold made for a miserable night, forcing her in and out of light, uneasy sleep.
As she languished in a groggy haze, the room seemed to grow colder, hinting at an intrusion.
A draft whispered through the room, and Sadie sensed the presence of someone else. Her eyelids, heavy as lead, fought against her efforts to see who it was.
“Don’t move.” A low, mesmerizing voice brushed against her ear, laced with quiet gentleness.
His large hand rested gently on her forehead, the heat from his touch making his features crease with concern.
  ? .
With a smooth motion, she was lifted, the refreshing scent of mint enveloping her like a fleeting breeze.
Almost instantly, however, the invasive aroma of medicinal bitterness overwhelmed her senses, pungent and overpowering, making her recoil.
She coughed violently, her body rejecting both the strong smell and the notion of treatment. With a feeble hand, she pushed away the proffered bowl of medicine. “I don’t feel well. I really can’t take this,” she whispered hoarsely.
“Just try,” the man insisted softly, his voice firm yet threaded with concern. His fingers tenderly grasped her chin, coaxing her to face him, his expression unwavering with patience.
“Noah…” she murmured in a daze, her voice trailing off as if clinging to the threads of her fading consciousness.
The man paused mid-motion, a storm of unspoken emotions swirling in his profound gaze.
Eventually, Sadie meekly complied, the bitter medicine coursing down her throat.
As her world blurred into shadows, she felt a gentle pressure as he carefully laid her on the bed, the sheets rustling softly around her.
Even as she drifted off, the room clung to a faint aroma of tobacco—a lingering trace of his presence, mingled with an elusive, comforting reassurance.
Morning light spilled across Sadie’s face as she stirred awake. As her eyes fluttered open, she realized she was resting on a soft bed, the aches in her body now a distant memory.
“Could Noah have returned?” she whispered to herself, pushing herself up against the plush pillows, her mind replaying the fragmented memories of the night before.
That familiar commanding voice, those gentle, searching eyes—could it really have been him? 
.

###Chapter 26:
The mere thought sent a thrill of excitement through her, a tender sweetness blossoming silently in her chest.
A low, insistent buzz filled the air as the phone on the bedside table rattled against the wood, breaking the quiet.
Sadie reached out, her hand trembling slightly as she answered.
On the other end of the line, a warm, motherly voice spoke with gentle concern. “Mrs. Wall, I’ve prepared some chicken soup for you. Be sure to have some once you’re up; it will help you recover faster.”
The voice belonged to Rosa Barrett, the devoted housekeeper who had faithfully served Sadie and Noah for years.
“Thank you, Rosa. I appreciate your concern,” Sadie replied, her voice polite but tinged with unmistakable disappointment.
As she set the phone down, her face drained of all color.
So, it wasn’t Noah.
The faint spark of hope that had flickered to life in her chest was ruthlessly snuffed out.
A self-deprecating laugh escaped her lips; she had let her imagination run wild again.
How could Noah, with his life of privilege, ever stoop to care for her—the wife he was planning to leave behind?
No doubt he was with Kyla now, lavishing her with affection and warmth.
Sadie sipped her steaming chicken soup, a semblance of comfort seeping into her weary bones.
She applied some blush to mask her pallor, grabbed her bag, and made her way to work.
As soon as she entered the office, Tina immediately came over, her expression clouded with worry.

“Sadie, are you alright?” she inquired, her brow furrowed.
“Just a slight cold. I’ll be fine after some rest,” Sadie replied, managing a weak smile.
“But you look terribly pale,” Tina noted, setting a cup of hot apple cider on Sadie’s desk. “Drink this; it’s great for boosting your immune system and fighting off colds—it’s amazing!”
With a genuine smile and an enthusiastic thumbs-up, Tina warmly recommended the concoction.noveldrama
Amusement flickered in Sadie’s eyes as a soft warmth filled her heart. “Thank you,” she murmured, her voice a gentle whisper.
“It’s nothing. We’re colleagues after all, and it’s only right we look out for each other,” Tina responded, giving Sadie’s shoulder a comforting pat.
Sadie nodded her head in acknowledgment, her heart caught in a tangled mix of emotions.
Despite her marriage, it was a colleague, not her husband, who offered her solace and concern.
And then there was Noah—where was he right now? And who was he with?
Just then, a soft, apologetic voice drifted from the hallway, halting Sadie’s spiraling thoughts.
“Noah, I didn’t mean to take up so much of your time—sorry about that.”
There was no mistaking that voice—it could only be Kyla.
A chill ran through Sadie as she instinctively turned, her eyes meeting the silhouette of the woman. Her body tensed, her complexion paler.
Tina, noticing the sudden shift in Sadie’s demeanor, followed her gaze and caught sight of a sophisticated woman facing away from them. The woman slightly tilted her head, exposing the graceful curve of her slender neck, her lips curled into a radiant smile directed at the man before her. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 27:
That smile, bright and seemingly innocent, stung Sadie’s eyes like a shard of glass.
With the notion that Sadie was unaware of Kyla’s identity, Tina chimed in helpfully, her voice low and tinged with intrigue, “Sadie, that’s the CEO’s rumored girlfriend, Kyla Wade.”
“They do seem quite close,” Sadie replied, her voice flat.
“I heard that Kyla had a heart attack last night. The CEO was so concerned he whisked her to the hospital and remained by her side the whole night. He only returned this morning,” Tina whispered, cautious of eavesdroppers.
A sharp pang of jealousy jabbed at Sadie’s heart, spreading a numbing ache.
So, her memories had been nothing more than a fanciful illusion.
With unwavering devotion, Noah stayed with Kyla at the hospital, keeping her company through the long night.
How could he possibly have found the time to check on her at home? Despite the turmoil swirling inside her, Sadie’s exterior remained unflappable. All she wanted was to leave the scene.
Yet, unexpectedly, Kyla appeared beside her. With a fake smile plastered on her face, she greeted Sadie.
“Good morning, Sadie. I’m sorry, but Noah was overly concerned about me and spent the entire night by my side at the hospital. Now, he’s fetching a glass of water for me. It’s rare to find someone so thoughtful.”
Sadie responded with a frosty smirk, her voice a whisper meant only for Kyla’s ears, laced with scorn. “Tell me, Kyla, if the whole world knew you were the homewrecker in my marriage with Noah, could you still parade around as Mrs. Wall in the future?”
The Wall family prized their reputation above all else.
At Sadie’s insinuation, Kyla’s complexion drained to a ghostly pale.

Sadie, that miserable bitch, actually had the audacity to threaten her! Seething, Kyla watched as Sadie turned sharply and strode away, not once glancing back.
Noah, returning with a glass of water, looked up just in time to catch a glimpse of Sadie’s retreating form.
A wave of inexplicable unease washed over him, leaving him restless and concerned.
Like sand slipping through his fingers, Noah felt something essential drifting away from him.
Without hesitation, he buried the unsettling feeling deep inside.
With an indifferent glance at Kyla, he said in a flat, unyielding tone, “Alright, I’m heading back to the office.”
Kyla gave a small, compliant nod, her expression docile.
Yet, as she watched Noah’s imposing silhouette recede down the corridor, her lips twisted into a smug, victorious smirk.
In her eyes, it was clear—she still had a firm grip on his heartstrings.noveldrama
With just a touch of her cunning, she had ensnared him once again.
But beneath that triumph, a bitter seed of resentment towards Sadie, Noah’s legal wife, sprouted. Kyla’s thoughts darkened.
If only Sadie hadn’t left for overseas, she wouldn’t have had the chance to wedge herself into Noah’s life.
Now was the perfect moment—Kyla was dead set on making sure Sadie ended up divorced and discarded.
With a scheme brewing in the depths of her twisted heart, Kyla’s heels clicked authoritatively against the floor as she entered the secretarial office.
Her eyes sparkled with manipulative delight as she addressed the room, her voice dripping with condescension. “There’s an important dinner tonight, and I need two of you to join me. Who’s coming with me?” She scanned every face with a predatory grin. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 28:
“So, who would like to do me the favor?” Her tone, laden with arrogance, left no doubt that refusing her request was not an option. As Noah’s rumored girlfriend, Kyla was someone that many sought to ingratiate themselves with.
Her voice barely carried over the crowd when a flurry of volunteers sprang forward, vying for her attention. “Miss Wade, allow me to accompany you!”
Kyla’s lips curled into a knowing smirk, her satisfaction palpable. Yet, with a shrewd glint in her eyes, she ignored the eager faces and fixated on Sadie, who remained nestled in the…
Solitude settled in the corner as Sadie remained still, her gaze fixed on Kyla, who now addressed her with a provocative undertone. “You, Sadie,” she declared, her red lips parting slightly.
Sadie’s head snapped up, her eyes locking with Kyla’s chilling stare. The message was clear.
As if on cue, the room’s attention shifted towards Sadie, spotlighting her with an intensity that felt almost palpable.
“Why so quiet? Don’t tell me you’re unwilling to do me this favor,” Kyla continued, her voice sweet, yet beneath the honeyed tones lay an unmistakable edge of coercion.
Fists tightening subtly at her sides, Sadie wrestled with the urge to decline. Now, more than ever, with her pregnancy, staying away from such dinners was the wiser choice. But before she could voice her ion, Kyla’s attention snapped to another male colleague.
“Mack, why don’t you join us as well?”noveldrama
Her voice was smooth and undeniably enticing as she addressed the male colleague with effortless charm.
Mack Walsh, who had been dozing off, jerked to full alertness. A hint of eagerness lit his eyes as he responded, his voice a mix of surprise and delight, “Absolutely, Miss Wade. It would be a pleasure.”
As Sadie watched the exchange, a cold realization washed over her. Kyla was orchestrating a spectacle, a deliberate move to corner her into submission, to strip her of the option to decline. It was a power play meant to showcase dominance, and Sadie was the chosen pawn.

Forcing a calm facade, she took a deep breath and curved her lips into a smile at Kyla. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to support the company, Miss Wade.”
Together, the three of them made their way to a private room at a restaurant. Mack took the lead, his steps brisk with newfound importance, while Kyla and Sadie followed, their pace more measured. Sadie could feel Kyla’s eyes on her, studying her, dissecting her every move with a mix of curiosity and a subtle glint of victory.
As they approached the door, Kyla halted abruptly, wearing an apologetic smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.
“Mack, Sadie, I apologize for imposing this social obligation on you both. As you’re aware, I’ve just returned from the hospital due to my heart condition, and the doctor has expressly forbidden me from drinking. However, this collaboration is vital, and if the occasion calls for a toast later, I’ll have to rely on you,” Kyla stated with a charming smile, her tone laced with subtle persuasion.
Mack immediately thumped his chest with a reassuring grin. “No worries at all, Miss Wade. You’re a valued guest of our company, and it’s admirable that you’re still pushing through for us despite your illness. Managing the drinks is the least we can do to help!”
Kyla nodded appreciatively, her satisfaction clear. However, her smile waned as she turned to Sadie, her voice adopting a slightly sharper tone. “Sadie, your dedication precedes you. Even before I came aboard, I heard tales of how you immerse yourself in work, earning quite the ‘workaholic’ badge. I trust you’ll handle this situation with your usual flair, right?”
The term “workaholic” struck Sadie like a sharp jab to the heart. It was clear that Kyla was intentionally putting her on the spot, trying to rattle her in front of Mack.

###Chapter 29:
Before Sadie could respond, Kyla casually shifted her gaze away and dismissed the tension with a wave of her hand. “Let’s head inside.”
Mack, noticing the subtle shift in Sadie’s demeanor, leaned closer and whispered, “Sadie, don’t stress over the drinking or what Miss Wade said. Being new to the company, she might not fully understand how things work yet.”
Sadie forced a strained smile as she murmured, “Thank you, Mack.”
As they opened the door to the secluded room, they were immediately enveloped by an air of sheer luxury. Above them, a crystal chandelier cast a cascade of twinkling lights across a table heaped with gourmet treats and bottles of fine wine. The room was heavy with the rich aromas of costly perfumes, subtly blending with a lingering trace of tobacco smoke.
Kyla entered with an elegant glide, her voice soft yet clear. “Mr. Valdez, Mr. Crawford, I hope I didn’t keep you waiting too long.”
The two men, previously engaged in light-hearted banter with their female companions, ceased their flirtations and rose promptly. Their expressions shifted to one of courteous eagerness.
“Oh, not at all, Miss Wade, you’ve arrived just in time,” replied one of them, his tone infused with gentle admiration.
“Indeed! Considering your hectic schedule, it’s truly a privilege that you’ve spared a moment to dine with us,” added the other, his smile broadening in genuine delight.
Kyla responded with a radiant smile that lit up the room, her eyes twinkling mischievously. “You flatter me, gentlemen. Truly, it is a pleasure to work alongside you.”
After exchanging a round of warm pleasantries, they all settled into the plush sofas.
Platt Crawford’s gaze then drifted over to Sadie and Mack, pausing with a hint of undisguised interest.
“And who might these two be?” Platt inquired, his curiosity piqued.

Kyla, putting on a fleeting act of modesty, swiftly handled the introductions. “Oh, these are my colleagues. Noah was concerned that drinking might not be the best idea for me while I’m still recovering, so he let me bring two assistants instead. Hope that’s alright!”
She emphasized the name “Noah” with a hint of pride, as if to underscore her special connection to him.
A shadow of discomfort briefly crossed Sadie’s features, her pupils narrowing as a subtle wave of bitterness washed over her.
In Kyla’s narrative, Noah was someone she spoke of with endearing familiarity, while Sadie was relegated to the role of a mere assistant.
The two men, skilled in the art of reading between the lines, exchanged knowing glances. Platt let out a hearty laugh, his voice filling the room. “I’ve often heard rumors of how close you and Mr. Wall are,” he said lightly. “Now that I see it for myself, I totally get it… Haha, should we start picking out gifts for the wedding?”
Kyla basked in the warm glow of the spotlight, her eyes briefly flicking to Sadie, who appeared lost and dejected. A sly smirk played at the corners of Kyla’s lips as a sense of victory surged through her.
She leaned in slightly, her voice dipping into a playfully ambiguous cadence as she addressed Platt. “You must be kidding. Mr. Wall would extend his concern to any colleague, wouldn’t he?”
She paused, letting the words linger, her tone laced with teasing suggestiveness. “After all, his kindness towards his team is quite legendary.”noveldrama
Her carefully chosen words danced around the truth, insinuating yet never confirming her rumored ties to Noah. This veiled implication left room for rampant speculation, stirring the imaginations of her listeners.
The more experienced members of the group, seasoned in corporate subtleties, caught the drift of her insinuations and shared knowing glances, their smiles crinkling at the edges of their eyes. As the conversation turned to more pressing matters, Mack shifted his focus, his voice imbued with a supportive undertone.

###Chapter 30:
“Sadie, would you do us the honor of presenting the project to Mr. Valdez and Mr. Crawford?” His gaze fell encouragingly on Sadie, who inhaled deeply, her demeanor shifting as she steeled herself against the emotions from earlier.
With a newly minted smile of confidence, she nodded. “Certainly, Mack.”
As she stepped into her professional role, Sadie seemed to transform before their eyes. Her stance became poised, her eyes sharp and focused. Her voice resonated with clarity and conviction as she detailed the project’s merits and potential. Each movement she made was charged with assurance, painting her as the epitome of a driven and formidable leader.
Kyla’s look of slight disdain towards Sadie gradually shifted to one of seriousness. As Sadie’s presentation unfolded, Kyla was forced to acknowledge the talent Sadie displayed, a talent that clearly justified Noah’s high opinion of her. This recognition stoked a fire of jealousy in Kyla, simmering with quiet intensity that threatened to engulf her.
As Sadie wrapped up her detailed presentation, the room erupted into enthusiastic applause.
“Absolutely brilliant! Miss Hudson, your insight was not only enlightening but also instills a solid confidence in our future collaboration!” Platt exclaimed, leading the applause. His admiration wasn’t just professional—his eyes briefly betrayed him, lingering appreciatively on Sadie’s poised figure.
Feeling a wave of satisfaction from the reception, Sadie was nonetheless eager to conclude the meeting. The tension with Kyla hung heavily in the air, making her want to escape the charged atmosphere. “With this in mind, concerning our collaboration…” she began, aiming to steer the conversation towards finalizing their agreement.
However, Platt interrupted, his tone taking on an unsettling quality as his eyes roamed over Sadie. “Miss Hudson, while signing the contract is certainly crucial, let’s not overlook the importance of building stronger personal connections while we’re all here,” he suggested, his gaze overtly sweeping across her and pausing suggestively at her waist with a sleazy grin.
“Miss Wade said you’re the kind of person who gives it their all for work. That’s exactly what a company needs. Let’s drink to that!” he declared, picking up a bottle of red wine from the center of the table. “We just received this incredibly strong wine—one sip, and you might feel it right away. Why not give it a shot?”
gα?ησν?s?com hosts captivating talesnoveldrama
Sadie’s gaze shifted to the bottle of red wine. The liquid’s deep, dark red hue was mesmerizing under the soft glow of the overhead lights—a rich color that hinted at a dangerously high alcohol content.
“You flatter me, Mr. Crawford, but I must confess, my tolerance for alcohol is embarrassingly low. I’m afraid I’ll bring the mood down instead of adding to the fun tonight,” Sadie replied.
“Oh, come now, Miss Hudson! Don’t sell yourself short,” Platt insisted, a playful edge to his voice. “Everyone harbors hidden strengths. How will you discover your limits if you never test them? Surely, you wouldn’t want to make me think you’re doubting my company, would you?”
Platt’s stare bored into Sadie, his eyes shimmering with undisguised greed, as if she were a trophy awaiting his claim.
Under the weight of his gaze, Sadie shifted uncomfortably, her voice faltering as she attempted another refusal. “Well, Mr. Crawford…”
“How about this, Miss Hudson,” Platt cut in, his voice dripping with allure. “I’ve got a major government project in the works. Drink this, and not only will I partner with your company, but I’ll also put you in charge. What do you say?”
The proposition hung in the air, tantalizingly within reach. Landing this project could secure a hefty commission and a much-needed bonus.
With her divorce from Noah looming and the financial strain of her baby’s future pressing on her mind, Sadie’s resolve hardened. “I’m in,” she declared, nodding with determination.

###Chapter 31:
With a shaky hand, Sadie reached for the bottle and poured herself half a glass of wine. Normally, wine was a familiar comfort, but tonight, with the flutter of nerves in her stomach and the knowledge of her pregnancy, it felt like a betrayal.
The scrutinizing eyes of the onlookers burned into her, spotlighting her every move.
Kyla watched from across the room, her chin propped on her entwined fingers, a sly smirk curving her lips. Her eyes sparkled with mockery, enjoying the unfolding drama with a predatory glee.noveldrama
A deep crease formed on Mack’s forehead as he paused, clearly torn on whether to speak.
Platt, however, watched with anticipation, as if waiting for the main event to begin.
Under the intense scrutiny of those around her, Sadie drew a deep, steadying breath and tipped the glass back, the wine disappearing in a single, determined gulp.
The moment the liquid scorched her throat, a fierce burning sensation erupted, sending her into a fit of violent coughing. Her body bent over in response, hands clutching the edge of the table for support, her posture a stark display of agony.
“Oh dear, Sadie,” Kyla exclaimed, her voice thick with mock concern as she delicately covered her mouth with a slender hand, her eyes twinkling maliciously. “Is that truly the extent of your tolerance? Surely, you’re not pretending?”
Mack’s expression softened, concern washing over his features. “Are you alright, Sadie?” he asked gently, his voice low and filled with worry.
Sadie waved her hand, a feeble attempt to dismiss their concern. Words failed her as the turmoil churned in her stomach, leaving her nearly voiceless.
“Really, Miss Hudson, if you didn’t wish to drink, you could have simply said so. But to drink and then cause such a spectacle? What are you trying to prove? Are you challenging me?” Platt’s expression darkened, his displeasure palpable as he took in Sadie’s disheveled state.
The atmosphere in the private room grew thick with tension, the air charged with an uncomfortable silence.
g?lnσν?s﹒оm opens doors to fiction
Amidst this, Kyla cleared her throat with an uneasy giggle, then turned apologetically toward Platt. “Mr. Crawford, I’m truly sorry for this lapse. It seems I haven’t disciplined my team well enough. Please, don’t take it to heart.”
Kyla turned sharply to Sadie, her demeanor shifting to one of stern reproach. “Miss Hudson, what has gotten into you today? You’ve never behaved this way before. Quickly, apologize to Mr. Crawford—he’s one of our key clients!” Her words cut through the silence, sharp and accusatory, piercing Sadie’s composure.
After battling a wave of nausea, Sadie managed to steady herself. She raised her pale face, eyes narrowing as she caught the flicker of smug satisfaction dancing in Kyla’s eyes. With a cold, mocking sneer, Sadie retorted, “Kyla, is this the best you can do—resorting to such petty schemes?”
Her voice, though soft, carried a chilling undertone that instantly wiped the smugness off Kyla’s face. Kyla, taken aback, struggled to respond.
Ignoring Kyla’s flustered state, Sadie pushed herself to her feet. She knew she needed to leave—now more than ever.
With shaky steps, she made her way out of the private room, each step echoing her resolve to escape the stifling atmosphere.
As Sadie rushed for the elevator, her thoughts collided with each other like a storm, but one resolve cut through the chaos—she would no longer tolerate being pushed around or bullied, especially not by Kyla.
Just as this determination solidified, the elevator chimed open.
In her haste, Sadie rushed inside, colliding with a man exiting the elevator. The impact sent a jolt through her body. Through the thin fabric of his shirt, Sadie could feel the firm contours of his muscles, a clear indication of his physical strength.
The man’s face twisted into a frown, an irritated grunt escaping him as he prepared to scold the careless intruder. However, his reprimand faltered as his gaze fell upon Sadie—the very woman who was supposed to be resting at home. A surge of frustration built within him, threatening to overflow.

###Chapter 32:noveldrama
With a firm grip, he seized Sadie’s shoulders, his brow furrowing deeper. “Sadie, what the hell are you doing here?” he demanded sharply. As he leaned closer, the unmistakable sharp scent of alcohol hit him, and his frown deepened into a scowl. “Have you been drinking?” he asked, his displeasure unmistakable.
The moment their bodies collided, Sadie immediately recognized him by his signature cold, woody fragrance—Noah. The realization only fueled her desire to flee.
She believed, deep down, that if Noah hadn’t been supporting Kyla, Kyla wouldn’t have dared target her so blatantly.
At that moment, Sadie was overwhelmed by discomfort, her senses heightened to an unbearable intensity. Though Noah’s touch had been gentle, a dull pain throbbed in her shoulders.
“Get your hands off me! Let me go!” she cried out, her voice trembling with desperation.
Her plea seemed only to provoke Noah, whose grip tightened in response. He pulled her flush against his chest, his hold unyielding as he spoke in a chilling tone. “Can’t resist making a mess, can you, Sadie? You’re not holding back anymore, huh?”
Noah’s imposing presence surrounded Sadie, and her heart squeezed painfully, as if trapped in a vice, stealing her breath away.
For a fleeting second, Sadie ceased her struggles, allowing herself to feel the confinement of his embrace. Her voice, when she spoke, was shaky and heavy with tears.
“What did I do to deserve this?” she asked, her voice breaking. “Since the love of your life came back, I didn’t stand in your way—I agreed to the divorce. I even left our home to keep the peace, yet it seems you and she just can’t let me be!”
In the midst of her emotional turmoil, Sadie unleashed a torrent of pent-up feelings.
A twisted sense of triumph flickered through Noah as he listened. Could her recent erratic actions be a sign of her love for him, still burning too fiercely to extinguish?

Thinking of the years of deep affection Sadie had shown him, Noah found it wasn’t so easy to simply let go. Perhaps his approach had been too harsh.
He exhaled a heavy, resigned sigh, signaling a reluctant compromise. “Alright, let’s put the brakes on the divorce for now. Take all the time you need to adjust, but know that I won’t stay forever.”
Sadie felt a sharp pang in her heart upon hearing his words. Did he really believe she needed time to adjust to the idea of their separation?
A bitter smile twisted her lips as tears cascaded down her cheeks.
“Noah, your cruelty knows no bounds,” she said, her voice cold and detached as she turned her head away, shutting her eyes to block out the sight of him. “I don’t need time to adjust. You can vanish from my life whenever you please—it would be better if you never returned!”
A shadow fell over Noah’s expression, his aura turning icy and menacing. He couldn’t believe she would dare speak to him like that.
Seizing her chin, he forced her to look at him, his voice sharp and commanding. “Sadie, don’t you forget—you are still my wife!”
“Wife?” Sadie’s lips curled into a bitter smile as she confronted Noah. “Tell me, Noah, am I really your wife? Or just another possession you think you can throw away when you’re done with it?”
“Noah!” At that moment, a soft, melodious voice echoed down the hallway.
Noah’s gaze shifted upwards, catching sight of Kyla emerging from the other end of the corridor. She was clad in a flowing white gown, her figure ethereal, almost like a porcelain doll brought to life.
As Sadie had stormed off earlier, Kyla had trailed behind, her steps light with the anticipation of witnessing Sadie’s misery, ready to add fuel to the fire. However, the scene that unfolded before Kyla was not the debacle she had envisioned. She was shocked by the sight of Sadie, now cradled securely in Noah’s arms.

###Chapter 33:
The intimacy of their embrace, the tender way Noah held her, sparked a seething rage within Kyla. They were so close, so entwined, that it seemed as though the world around them had dissolved.
Jealousy clawed at Kyla’s heart, fierce and unrelenting. She couldn’t comprehend it all. Why did Sadie, of all people, receive such affection and tenderness from Noah?
As Kyla approached, her smile softened even further, her hand extending warmly toward Noah. Her voice, infused with tender concern, broke the tension. “Noah, why don’t you let me take care of Sadie?”
There was a softness in her voice, wrapped in just enough worry to make it seem like she was the only one who genuinely cared for Sadie. Yet, instead of releasing his hold, Noah clutched Sadie tighter to his chest, his brows knitting together in a mix of confusion and slight irritation.
“What are you doing here?” he demanded, his voice edged with mild annoyance.
Kyla’s outstretched hand closed on empty air, and she paused, her face a mask of fleeting confusion before she smoothly retracted her hand. With a casual flick, she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, concealing her momentary embarrassment. Maintaining her composed demeanor, she replied softly, “Noah, don’t tell me it’s already slipped your mind? I brought this up last night. You were overwhelmed, so I offered to handle the contract negotiations with Mr. Crawford from Sky Tech.”
Noah’s mind flickered with a vague memory of that conversation. After he had dropped Kyla off at the hospital, his thoughts had been overwhelmingly occupied with Sadie’s health, only half-hearing Kyla’s words. He had nodded absentmindedly, his attention already elsewhere as he rushed off. That casual dismissal, though unintentional, had pierced Kyla like a dagger, wounding her deeply.
Still oblivious to the depth of Kyla’s hurt, Noah asked, “And Sadie? Why on earth is she here with you?”
With a casual ease, Kyla spoke as if she were merely commenting on a sunny afternoon. “Noah, you know there’s always drinking at these gatherings, and with my heart condition, I simply can’t drink. I heard that Sadie is exceptionally diligent at work, so I figured she could handle it. That’s why I asked her to step in.”
  ? .
She studied Noah’s face intently, her eyes searching for the usual gentle understanding he had shown so many times before—hoping he would let the issue pass without fuss, as he always did. However, this time, his response was unexpectedly icy. “Sadie’s not feeling well either,” he stated flatly.
What?
Kyla stood rooted to the spot, shocked. For a fleeting moment, she questioned whether she was trapped in some surreal dream. Wait… was he seriously defending Sadie?
The thought pierced through Kyla like a sharp thorn, igniting a wild blaze of jealousy within her. She lifted her eyes, only to meet Noah’s intense, unwavering stare. There was a chilling coldness and an unspoken warning in his eyes that she had never seen directed at her before.
Feeling a tight knot in her chest, Kyla fought back any show of displeasure. Instead, she clenched her fist so tightly that her nails dug into her palm, and with a voice tinged with innocence yet laced with self-reproach, she murmured, “I had no idea about Sadie’s condition… I never would have involved her had I known. Remember, after I saved you and barely escaped those kidnappers, I was left with this heart condition. You promised, Noah—you said you’d always look after me.”
Noah remained silent, his deep eyes fixed on Kyla with an intensity that seemed to pierce through her very soul.
After a prolonged silence, he averted his gaze, his features shadowed by a mix of emotions—unreadable and foreboding.
“I haven’t forgotten—I don’t break my promises. The Wall Group is the only thing keeping Sky Tech from sinking,” he said, his voice low and steady. “You don’t need to be so deferential toward its CEO. When it comes to the partnership, he’s not our only choice. And you had no right to involve Sadie.”
Kyla’s heart thudded painfully against her chest.

###Chapter 34:
A wave of irritation crashed over her as she pressed her lips together and murmured, “Noah, I’m sorry. I didn’t think it through.”
Noah ignored Kyla’s apology and shifted his focus to Sadie, who looked half-conscious and pale in his arms. His eyes darkened with concern as he gently guided her toward the private room.
Kyla watched Noah’s figure, her fists clenched so tightly that her nails dug into her palms, drawing pain without her noticing.
Kyla was determined to win against Sadie no matter what it took.
Inside the private room, an opulent yet eerie atmosphere enveloped the space. The crystal chandelier cast a ghostly glow over the polished mahogany table, intensifying the room’s unsettling aura.noveldrama
“People rave about Miss Hudson’s brilliance at the Wall Group, but today, I see she’s nothing special.”
Platt, his ample stomach brushing against the edge of the table, spoke with palpable disdain and a mocking tone.
Marvin Valdez, who was perched next to him, eagerly joined in, his eyes gleaming with amusement.
“I heard she’s closed million-dollar deals on her own—showing the world she’s just as ruthless and sharp as any man in the game! For all her reputation, she can’t even hold her liquor! Ha! Women belong at home raising kids, not sticking their noses where they don’t belong in the business world. She wants to play with the big leagues, yet one drink has her tapping out? Pathetic!”
Mack, who had been quietly simmering with irritation, couldn’t hold back any longer. His voice cracked with emotion as he interjected, “Mr. Crawford, please watch your words!”
Platt, unfazed, gave Mack a condescending look and waved him off dismissively. “Oh, come on, Mack. I get it, a man’s instinct to defend a woman he admires, but don’t let that blind you to reality. Spoil a woman too much, and she’ll crumble the moment reality hits.”
He leaned closer, and his voice dropped to a sly whisper, heavy with insinuation. “And let’s not forget, some women are masters of manipulation—maintaining an innocent facade while cunningly advancing their own agendas behind the scenes.”
More content at gα?ησνs?c?m
Laughter rippled through the group, yet Mack’s expression didn’t waver.
“Mr. Crawford is absolutely right. These days, a pretty face isn’t just a blessing; it’s a stepping stone. Makes you wonder what underhanded tricks they resort to for climbing the ladder so swiftly.”
“Couldn’t agree more! Some women pretend to be saints in the daylight, but once the doors shut, they know exactly how to seduce their prey!”
As their laughter grew louder and more obnoxious, a piercing, cold voice sliced through the cacophony.
“Let me get this straight—according to you, Mr. Crawford, the women at Wall Group are just eye candy?”
Platt’s smirk froze on his face as he swiveled toward the door. Standing there was Noah, his figure outlined by the sleek, tailored lines of a dark suit that accentuated his commanding presence. His features were sharp, his expression icy as he surveyed the room with a gaze so frigid it seemed to lower the temperature.
The sheer force of his arrival sent a palpable chill across the gathering.
What left them truly speechless was the fact that he was standing there, holding Sadie—the same woman they had just belittled. With her cheeks burning red, Sadie leaned hazily against his chest, their proximity exuding an undeniable intimacy.
Murmurs filled the room, the previous arrogance turning into whispers of confusion.
Wasn’t Kyla the one everyone claimed to be Noah’s girlfriend?
Why the hell was he suddenly playing hero for a damn secretary? 
.
.
.
###Chapter 35:
Under the impression that Kyla would be Noah’s future bride, Platt had no qualms about conspiring with her to humiliate Sadie. However, if he had misjudged the situation, the consequences would be disastrous—he’d be as good as dead. As these thoughts churned through his mind, Platt rose, his face breaking into an ingratiating smile directed at Noah.
“Please, forgive my earlier oversight in properly welcoming you,” he said, his voice carrying a tone of deference.
Immediately, the room buzzed to life as everyone stood, shuffling chairs and clearing the way to honor their guest. The seat of honor and its adjacent chair were conspicuously left vacant.
Noah watched the orchestrated commotion silently, his expression unreadable. Only after the last murmurs had settled did he gracefully take the chair reserved for him.
Kyla, poised to sit beside him, paused mid-step as Noah, in a surprising move, gestured for Sadie to sit next to him instead. The room filled with whispered speculations and furtive glances towards Kyla, whose plans seemed to unravel before her eyes.
“Kyla, what’s the deal with Miss Hudson? Why is Mr. Wall acting like she’s someone important?” A woman, dressed in eye-catching, over-the-top clothing, covered her mouth with a delicate hand, her voice a syrupy blend of curiosity and scorn.
A man joined in, skepticism lacing his tone. “Miss Wade, weren’t you just telling us how Mr. Wall…”
Kyla inhaled sharply, quelling the storm inside her. She put on a forced smile and replied, “Mr. Wall has always been exceptionally attentive to every member of his staff. With Sadie drunk, he’s obviously going to ensure she gets the care she needs.”
“Oh, is that so?”
The crowd murmured, their disbelief thinly veiled by nodding heads, their expressions etched with doubt. But wasn’t this care unusually personal?
It was clear to anyone observing that there was something more to it. And Noah—known for his indifference towards romantic entanglements and his cutthroat decisiveness—since when did he exhibit such warmth and concern for a woman?
Yet, no one dared to call out Kyla’s bluff.
With her facade intact, Kyla moved to another seat, sitting ramrod straight, fully aware of the curious glances thrown her way. Her cheeks burned with embarrassment.
Her hands clenched into fists under the table, nails digging painfully into her flesh, yet she remained outwardly composed, oblivious to the physical discomfort her own body inflicted.
The spacious private room was engulfed in a stifling silence. Everyone present was on edge, scarcely daring to draw a deep breath for fear that even the slightest noise might provoke the formidable man seated in the chair of honor.
Noah’s piercing eyes swept across the room, and wherever his steely gaze landed, it seemed to exert an invisible, crushing weight. People instinctively lowered their heads, shunning his scrutiny as if the mere act of meeting his eyes could spell disaster. His gaze, sharp and discerning, seemed to slice through the tense atmosphere, sending a chill skittering across everyone’s skin.
Just as the room’s anxiety was teetering on the brink of unbearable, Noah broke the silence. His voice was calm, almost disinterested, as his thin lips parted slightly to deliver two simple words: “Mr. Crawford.”
Despite the casual delivery, those words landed with the explosive force of a thunderclap, echoing ominously in the tense air.
At the mention of his name, Platt felt an icy dread snake down his spine, his back slick with cold sweat. He shot up from his seat as if jolted by an electric current, snapping to attention like a soldier heeding a general’s call. Standing ramrod straight, his hands aligned precisely along the seams of his trousers, he leaned forward in a deferential bow and asked with a tremulous voice, “Mr. Wall, what can I do for you?”
Noah let the question hang in the air, his response delayed as he turned his attention to Sadie. She reclined in her chair, her head resting against the high back, eyes half-lidded and her complexion ghostly pale, a picture of distress. A shadow crossed Noah’s features, and the oppressive atmosphere thickened palpably around him. noveldrama

###Chapter 36:
He slowly redirected his gaze towards Platt, allowing a small, chilling chuckle to escape his lips—a sound deceptively gentle yet laden with an unspoken threat.
“You sure have a thing for drinking, don’t you? Well, today you’re in for a treat,” Noah declared with a sly grin. He snapped his fingers, the sound crisp and resonant in the hushed confines of the private room.
At his signal, Samuel, who had been poised just outside, swung the door open. Waiters strode in one after another, their movements smooth and precise. They filed in two neat rows, each carrying bottles of wine that gleamed under the soft lighting. One by one, they set the bottles before Platt, each placement marked by the soft chime of glass meeting wood—a sound ominously reminiscent of a tolling bell in Platt’s increasingly anxious ears.noveldrama
His complexion drained to a ghostly pallor. A fine sheen of sweat beaded on his brow, and his discomfort was palpable in the thickening silence. The entire spectacle wrapped up in five minutes.
Finally, as the last bottle was placed, the lead waiter stepped forward, his voice breaking the suspense. “Mr. Wall, all the wine is here,” he announced, his tone formal yet tinged with a hint of disbelief. The room held its breath. The extent of Noah’s command—every bottle in the restaurant laid out before them—was staggering.
Was he trying to make Platt drink himself to death?
Noah’s gaze swept over the assembly, landing with icy finality on Platt. His lips barely moved as he spoke, but the word “Enjoy” fell from them like a verdict, resonating with a chilling authority that sent a shiver down Platt’s spine.
Platt’s breath hitched, unease settling in as he stared at the mountain of wine bottles. He conjured a smile, more like a strained grimace, as he stammered, “Well, Mr. Wall, th-this is… it’s rather excessive.” He flicked a desperate glance towards Kyla, silently pleading for intervention from the normally eloquent diplomat.
Catching his cue, Kyla nodded subtly. She gracefully swept a loose strand of hair behind her ear as she chimed in, her voice deliberately softened to convey concern. “Noah, forcing down this much wine could be deadly—”
Her words were laced with a feigned fragility, designed to evoke Noah’s protective instincts.
gα?ησν?som has it all
Yet, before she could elaborate, Noah cut her off with a stern, commanding tone. “So, you’re aware of the risks, then?”
His voice, though not raised, carried a potent, resonant force that filled the charged silence of the room.
His sharp gaze swept across the faces before him, resting on Kyla with a glint of sarcasm and unmistakable chill.
His insinuation was clear, and it struck Kyla directly.
A storm of emotions whirled within her, her complexion paling. It never crossed her mind that Noah would go to such extremes for Sadie.
The weight of it hit so hard, it felt like the air had been sucked from her lungs.
Beneath the table, her fingers gripped her handbag with such intensity that her knuckles whitened.
The gentle mask she had so meticulously maintained began to fracture, revealing a hint of the turmoil within.
Platt, too, understood the gravity of the situation. He recognized that he had provoked someone truly formidable. Consequences loomed over him, inevitable and severe.
Trapped with no escape, he sank to his knees with a resounding thud, his hands clasped before him, the very picture of desperation. With urgency laced in his tone, his words shattered the tense stillness surrounding them. “Miss Hudson, I was foolish to cross you, and I sincerely regret it. Please, show some mercy and convince Mr. Wall to let me off just this once!”
The room was enveloped in a palpable silence, every attendee frozen, their breaths held as they witnessed the unfolding drama. 
.

.
###Chapter 37:
Who would have thought that Platt, a dominant force in business, would be reduced to pleading for mercy from a woman who appeared so fragile?
Sadie, her eyes slowly fluttering open, fixed a weak yet resolute gaze on Platt. Her voice, though soft, was infused with an unwavering resolve. “Mr. Crawford, when I continuously declined your request, neither you nor Miss Wade showed me any leniency. You branded me a workaholic, so devoted to the company that I’d overlook personal boundaries. You dismissed my refusal to drink, insisting that without my compliance, you wouldn’t work with Wall Group.”
“Mr. Crawford, were those your words?” Sadie pressed, her voice dripping with sarcasm, which visibly darkened Platt’s expression.
His lips quivered as he struggled with the weight of her words. After a painful pause, he managed a reply, his voice barely above a whisper. “Miss Hudson, I messed up—please, give me this one chance to make it right.”
Kyla, who had never imagined she’d witness Sadie—the typically reserved woman—confronting someone, felt a sudden urge to defend Platt. She almost rose to speak on his behalf, but Noah’s frosty stare rooted her to the spot.
“Mr. Crawford, since you hold such contempt for Wall Group, I believe it’s best we sever our ties now.” Noah’s tone was as cold as the arctic, leaving no room for Platt to argue.noveldrama
Overwhelmed by the gravity of the situation, Platt collapsed to the floor, his face the picture of despair. Despite all efforts, his company had never risen beyond mediocrity. A massive conglomerate like Wall Group, built on generations of success, could bankrupt his company without even breaking a sweat. In a last-ditch effort to salvage the situation, Platt grabbed a bottle of wine and declared, “Mr. Wall, I’ll drink!” He then took a desperate gulp, hoping against hope to mend the irreparable rift.
The fiery liquid scorched its way down his throat, causing his eyes to water, yet Platt persisted, knowing this momentary agony was trivial compared to the devastation of bankruptcy.
One bottle, two bottles, three bottles…
  ? .
No one dared to make a sound, their eyes fixed on Platt as he drowned himself in liquor, each bottle tipping back like the final act of a doomed man.
Platt’s torment dragged on, bottle after bottle, until the fifth sealed his fate. His body failed, his world spun, and in the next second, he collapsed—nothing but dead weight on the cold floor.
Noah, his face twisted in a grimace of revulsion, turned to Samuel with icy detachment. “I’ll leave the rest to you,” he commanded, his voice brooking no argument.
“Absolutely, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded with a deferential nod. Disregarding the shocked faces around him, Noah snatched up his coat and strode out, Sadie in tow.
The chill of the night air greeted them, cutting through the stench of alcohol that clung to their clothes. It was a welcome, cleansing breeze that seemed to clear Sadie’s senses slightly. She shook her head vigorously, trying to shake off the lingering haze of alcohol. She needed to get away, to find solace in the quiet of her own space.
She walked straight to the roadside, intending to hail a taxi home. There was something unsettling about the way Sadie ignored him, leaving Noah with a vague but persistent discomfort he couldn’t put into words. He approached her and grasped her hand, his voice tinged with irritation. “After everything I did for you tonight, Sadie, do I not even get a word?”
Sadie turned to face him, her eyes wide with a mix of surprise and indifference. “Oh, thank you,” she murmured, her tone flat.
“That’s it?” Noah chuckled dryly, his frustration bubbling to the surface. “Just a ‘thank you’?”
“What more do you expect?” Sadie retorted, her confusion evident. “What else should I say?”

###Chapter 38:
Noah paused, caught off guard by his own escalating annoyance. He didn’t really know what he expected her to say; it was her nonchalant demeanor that irked him.
Seizing the moment, he pulled her a bit closer, his expression serious. “You never fail to stir things up, do you, Sadie? You knew you were sick, but that didn’t stop you from showing up at this dinner anyway. So, you think the company’s incapable of closing a deal unless you’re involved?”
“You’re being unreasonable, Noah!” Sadie snapped, her frustration flaring. Noah had heard Kyla admit she practically dragged her to this event. Yet here he was, conveniently overlooking the real culprit, placing all the blame directly on her. Was he really accusing her of bringing this on herself?
Exasperated and done with the confrontation, Sadie broke away from his grasp, flagged down a taxi, and disappeared into the night without a backward glance.
As the taxi disappeared into the night, Noah’s face twisted into a terrifying grimace. The anger radiating from him was palpable, his frustration boiling over as he delivered a sharp kick to the railing. The sound of leather slamming into metal pierced the quiet, reverberating ominously.
From a distance, Kyla had observed every moment of the altercation, her eyes fixed on the unfolding drama. As Noah and Sadie parted ways under a cloud of discord, a smug smile slowly spread across Kyla’s face.
After allowing Noah some time to cool down, Kyla approached him with deliberate steps, her voice dripping with feigned remorse. “Noah, you can’t hold Sadie responsible for her reaction. It was my fault—I made a mistake today, and it upset her. I’ll make it right tomorrow; I’ll apologize to her first thing at the office.”
She lowered her gaze, letting the shadows of her lashes fall over her cheeks, her voice soft.
“No need,” Noah snapped, his voice icy, tinged with an irritation that was almost imperceptible. “She’s the one who put herself in this mess. She could’ve just spoken up if she wasn’t feeling well, couldn’t she?”
Kyla’s expression tightened, her features hardening. Though Noah seemed to be chastising Sadie, it was clear that concern, not disdain, colored his words.

She stole a glance at her phone. The call had ended. A cold smile curled her lips again. The dim light from the screen highlighted her flawless skin, but it failed to mask the cunning glint in her eyes.
Minutes ago, in the back seat of the taxi, Sadie had every intention of closing her eyes and finding a moment of respite. But the shrill ring of her phone shattered the silence.
It was Kyla calling.
With annoyance knitting her brow, Sadie instinctively reached for the reject button. However, in her haste, her finger grazed the touchscreen, inadvertently accepting the call instead.
Noah’s voice burst through the speaker, his words hitting her like a cold, unexpected slap. The raw accusation in his tone left her stunned, a chill creeping down her spine. So, he truly believed that all her misfortunes were solely her own making!
A sharp pang of betrayal twisted in her chest, as if her heart had been cleaved in two, bleeding out silently. Her grip on the phone tightened, her knuckles whitening with the strain, yet her eyes remained dry. She stubbornly refused to spill any tears.
The following day, Sadie walked into the Wall Group offices as if nothing had changed. Yet, as she settled into her routine, Tina approached her with a probing stare.
“Sadie, what exactly is your relationship with Mr. Wall?” Tina’s voice was laced with curiosity, her gaze piercing.
Sadie felt a knot tighten in her chest, but she masked her discomfort with a casual shrug and questioned, “What do you mean by that?”
“Mr. Wall whisked you away like a knight in shining armor!” Tina declared, her voice rising with theatrical flair as she mimicked Noah’s tone. “You’ve got two options, Mr. Crawford. Drink yourself to death or sit back and watch your company collapse! How amazing is that?” Her eyes sparkled with unabashed admiration as she blinked rapidly, clearly enthralled by the story.

###Chapter 39:
Sadie hadn’t anticipated that the rumors would circulate through the office so swiftly, thrusting her once again into the relentless whirl of office gossip. Back when she married Noah, only a select few were privy to their union. Now, with Kyla’s return, Noah must be even more determined to distance himself from any association with her.
“It’s strictly professional—a classic boss and subordinate dynamic,” Sadie asserted, her voice a soft murmur as she cast her eyes downward, veiling the flicker of sadness that threatened to surface. “Mr. Wall is renowned not just for his generosity but also for his unwavering loyalty. Were any of you compelled to drink against your will, he’d undoubtedly defend you, too.”
“Huh?” Tina’s jaw dropped, her expression morphing into one of incredulity. She searched for something to counter Sadie’s impeccable defense, but finding none, she hesitantly backed down, her skepticism lingering in the tense air.
Sadie sank into her seat, her mind swirling with chaotic thoughts. Could Noah possibly harbor lingering feelings for her? This tantalizing possibility fluttered through her consciousness briefly before she firmly squashed it. No, Noah didn’t love her; she couldn’t let herself succumb to baseless daydreams.
Inside the CEO’s office, Samuel dutifully completed his rundown of the day’s agenda for Noah. Then, he hesitantly broached the subject of the latest office whispers that were circulating.
Noah’s face remained impassive, his features set in an icy mask that seemed to chill the very air around him. The atmosphere grew heavy, laden with tension. Samuel, standing rigidly before him, felt a nervous sweat bead on his forehead, his hands slightly trembling.
“Do I seriously have to tell you how to deal with these simple matters?” Noah’s voice sliced through the silence, sharp and unforgiving, without even a glance in Samuel’s direction.
Disappointment crept into Samuel’s heart. It appeared that Noah was truly indifferent to his wife, Sadie. Samuel realized there was little he could do to mend the fissures in their relationship.
“Mr. Wall, please be at ease; your wife has already cleared up the misunderstandings,” Samuel hastily assured, adopting a professional demeanor to mask his inner turmoil.

As Samuel was about to depart, Noah’s voice halted him abruptly. “What did she say?”
Noah’s inquiry was flat, emotionless, yet Samuel detected an underlying current of something intense, something not quite definable.
“Well, she said…” Samuel paused, scrutinizing Noah’s stoic facade as he chose his words carefully. “She said that the two of you have nothing more than a typical boss-subordinate relationship. She praised your compassion and protective nature, insisting that you’d defend any employee just as fiercely against injustices.”
With each word, Samuel’s enthusiasm grew; he couldn’t help admiring Sadie’s tactful maneuver—it was a masterstroke, painting Noah as an approachable and benevolent leader. However, Noah’s countenance abruptly shifted; his mood soured as he slammed a pen against the desk with a sharp crack. “Get out!” he bellowed, his voice booming with authority.
Samuel recoiled, wasting no time as he made his exit from the ominous atmosphere of the office. Left alone, Noah slumped into his expansive chair, his features twisted into an ominous scowl.
Outside the office, the echo of high heels on the polished floor signaled someone approaching. Kyla, donned in a sleek Chanel suit, paused at the doorway of the CEO’s office. “Samuel, is Noah inside?” she inquired with a knowing smirk, her voice laced with playful tease, already aware of the answer.noveldrama
When Kyla appeared, Samuel’s face lit up with relief, as though he had just spotted a lifeline. His smile was wide, almost ingratiating. “Miss Wade, perfect timing! Mr. Wall’s in a foul mood. You’re the only one who can handle him. He could use your soothing presence.”
After a soft knock on the door, Noah, mistaking the visitor for Sadie, adjusted his tone to something more commanding. “Come in,” he called out.

###Chapter 40:
However, it was Kyla who sauntered in, her presence marked by a wave of her potent perfume. As the fragrance enveloped him, Noah’s expression shifted subtly; his brow creased slightly, betraying a flash of irritation. He had always had an aversion to strong perfumes, deeming them somewhat pretentious.
“What brings you here?” Noah questioned, his voice cool, masking his growing annoyance. Despite his cool demeanor, his thoughts inadvertently wandered to Sadie—the simple, refreshing scent of her shower gel lingering in his mind, sharply contrasting with the perfume now filling his office.
Kyla, sensing the tension, swept a strand of hair behind her ear and offered a soft, reassuring smile. “Noah, Samuel mentioned you were feeling out of sorts, and I couldn’t help but worry,” she said, her voice laced with concern. “Is it still about the incident with Sadie and the drinking? I messed up. I wasn’t thinking straight. I’m really sorry,”
Her words were smooth, her demeanor empathetic, yet internally, she harbored a flicker of resentment towards Sadie. It was Sadie, after all, who had inadvertently cast a shadow over her standing with Noah. At her words, Noah’s frown only deepened.
“Don’t stress over it. Nobody’s perfect—we all mess up now and then,” Noah stated, his voice steady, betraying not a trace of emotion.
Kyla’s smile faltered, her heart sinking as she realized he hadn’t denied her assumption about his reason for being upset. A sense of alarm echoed through her thoughts—Noah’s affection for Sadie was evidently more profound than she’d anticipated. No, she couldn’t stand by and watch Sadie claim everything that was hers!
Masking her turmoil, Kyla adopted a more compassionate demeanor. “Even so, I should show Sadie my sincerity through actions. Since Sadie hasn’t been feeling well, perhaps it’s best if she takes some time off to recover, don’t you think?”
Noah paused, considering her suggestion with a thoughtful frown before nodding in agreement. “Alright, we’ll follow your advice.”
In the bustling secretarial office, Sadie was immersed in her tasks, organizing piles of documents with diligent focus. It was her duty day, and she was responsible for compiling all the office documents and delivering them to Noah.

Contemplating the recent tensions with Noah, Sadie felt a pang of unease. After much deliberation, she approached Samuel with a tentative air, her voice low and respectful. “Samuel, could you please assist me in delivering these documents to the CEO’s office? I just…”
Samuel cut her off, his expression uncomfortable. “I’m afraid that’s not going to happen. Mr. Wall prefers not to have others handle his documents, especially the crucial ones that need his personal approval.”noveldrama
Sadie’s expression froze, her disappointment palpable. Struggling to find the right words, she stood there, momentarily lost. Despite the turmoil swirling within her, she recognized the importance of professionalism. With a resigned sigh, she inhaled deeply, mustering her resolve, and strode towards the CEO’s office.
Just as her hand was poised to knock, the door swung open with a soft “click.” The immediate waft of perfume enveloped Sadie, causing her to lift her gaze abruptly. There, framed in the doorway, stood Kyla, her features enhanced by flawless makeup. Dressed in an impeccably tailored Chanel suit, Kyla exuded an aura of sophistication. Yet, her smug expression was particularly glaring. Sadie’s hand hung suspended in the air, her face draining of color.
Kyla, oblivious to Sadie’s reaction or choosing to ignore it, strode confidently to the heart of the secretarial office. With a brisk clap that sliced through the murmurs, she beamed a practiced smile and announced, “Everyone, may I have your attention, please?” The office fell into a curious hush, all eyes drawn to Kyla.
“Here’s the situation,” Kyla began, her smile unwavering and her voice dipped in a soothing cadence. “I realize now that my decisions yesterday may have unintentionally slighted both Sadie and Mack. To convey my genuine regret, I’ve ordered milkshakes for everyone. I hope this can smooth over any hard feelings.”
Her words were met with a ripple of cheers, the office buzzing with appreciative murmurs for Kyla’s thoughtful gesture. 
.

###Chapter 41:
Meanwhile, Tina leaned closer to Sadie, her voice a hushed undertone. “Sadie, doesn’t it seem like Kyla is a bit cunning? If she truly meant to apologize to you and Mack, wouldn’t a private moment have been more appropriate? It’s pretty obvious she’s turning your struggles into a publicity stunt to make herself look good.”
Sadie managed a wry smile in response, her eyes narrowing slightly. True to her style, Kyla knew exactly how to put on a performance, shaping the story to fit her needs.
As if on cue, four burly bodyguards dressed in black uniforms made their entrance, carrying two enormous tubs of milkshakes. The spectacle drew intrigued glances and whispered speculations from every corner of the room.
Kyla lingered at the threshold of the secretarial office, her smile radiant and warm as she oversaw the bodyguards placing an array of colorful milkshakes on the desk. With a flourish, she began distributing the sweet treats gracefully.
“Thank you, Kyla!”
“Kyla, you’re an absolute treasure.”
“Kyla, this is beyond thoughtful of you.”
As she basked in the glow of admiration, Kyla’s smile widened, her eyes twinkling with the pleasure of being the center of attention—the puppeteer in her own grand play.
As the milkshakes dwindled to just two remaining cups, she scanned the room and asked with a soft, inviting voice, “Is there anyone who hasn’t received their milkshake?”noveldrama
Tina exchanged a hesitant glance with Sadie, her expression torn.
The weight of loyalty tugged at her heartstrings. Sadie had become more than just a colleague; she was a friend, someone Tina was inclined to support without hesitation.
Yet, the prospect of being the only rebel to decline Kyla’s offering hung over her like a dark cloud—a mark of defiance that could isolate her in this tight-knit office environment.

Sadie caught the flicker of conflict in Tina’s eyes and felt a surge of warm gratitude mixed with concern.
She treasured Tina’s support but was keenly aware of the potential repercussions it could bring upon her friend in such a scrutinizing setting.
Sadie nudged Tina’s arm just enough to get her attention and said softly, “Go grab the milkshake. I’m fine, really. Don’t trouble yourself over me.”
Tina hesitated, her lip caught nervously between her teeth, before her hand shot up with a reluctant, “Me!”
Kyla passed the frosty drink to Tina, her gaze drifting leisurely toward Sadie, her smile unwavering and radiant. “And Sadie, this one’s for you.” She offered the last cup with warmth, as if they were long-lost friends reunited.
Sadie eyed the creamy concoction, the pungent aroma of fresh milk hitting her hard, the sugary scent nearly overpowering, churning her stomach.
With a subtle step back, she lowered her voice and gently declined. “No, thank you. I’m actually allergic to milkshakes.”
A hush fell over the room as curious eyes darted between Sadie and Kyla.
Sadie’s refusal, meant to be discreet and polite, seemed to strike a nerve.
Kyla’s expression shifted subtly, her eyes downcast as her lashes cast shadows across her porcelain cheeks. Her voice was tinged with hurt, almost too faint to catch.
“Sadie, it seems you’re still holding a grudge. Why else would you make up such a lame excuse like a milkshake allergy just to turn me down?”
That single, biting sentence drew a clear line between Sadie and everyone else in the room.
As expected, a wave of criticism swiftly followed, targeting Sadie with sharp, unsparing words.
“Sadie, that was uncalled for. Kyla admitted her mistake and genuinely apologized—don’t make this tougher on her than it needs to be!” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 42:
“Come on, it’s just a cup of milkshake. Is it really that big of a deal?”
“Kyla has good intentions. How could you be so harsh?”
Each syllable of reproach sliced through Sadie like shards of ice, her heart sinking with every word.
She mustered a brittle smile, her face a mask of forced composure. Drawing in a deep breath to quell the tempest of emotions churning inside her, Sadie fixed her gaze on Kyla.
“Kyla, this is what you wanted, isn’t it?”
Her response was measured and firm, the clarity of her tone cutting through the murmurs of the office.
The office fell silent, all eyes darting between the two women. Kyla’s response was not one of irritation, but of increased radiance; her smile widened, tinged with a provocative and triumphant gleam.
It was as if she was silently proclaiming her victory, suggesting that Sadie was no match for her cunning.
With a sly smirk, Kyla leaned in, her crimson lips hovering near Sadie’s ear, whispering just loud enough for her alone to hear. “That’s right. I’m telling you that if I wanted to strip you of everything, it would be as easy as pie.”
The heat of her breath tickled the sensitive skin behind Sadie’s ear, sending an involuntary shiver cascading down her spine. Her fists clenched tightly, nails digging into the flesh of her palms.
Sadie fought the fierce urge to strike Kyla.
But this was their workplace, after all. Noah was just next door, separated only by a thin wall. Acting on impulse now would do nothing but backfire on her.
Kyla took silent pleasure in the way Sadie kept herself in check, as if savoring a secret triumph.
There was something deeply gratifying about seeing Sadie so visibly disturbed yet utterly powerless; it affirmed Kyla’s dominance, complete and undisputed.
L?ττ ch?ρτ?rs ιn glov?ls.?
Straightening up, Kyla smoothly transitioned back to her usual poised and polished demeanor. She cleared her throat slightly and raised her voice, ensuring everyone could hear her.
“Sadie, I understand you haven’t been feeling great lately. Noah and I decided it would be best for you to take a break and focus on recovering.”
Her voice was dripping with sweetness, her tone so tender, as if she genuinely cared for Sadie’s well-being.
Yet, a cold shiver crawled down Sadie’s spine as anger surged within her, bubbling dangerously close to the surface.
Her eyes widened in sheer disbelief as she fixed her piercing gaze on Kyla, her words coming out sharply through clenched teeth.
“Who do you think you are to decide for me?”
The fury in Sadie’s eyes burned brightly.
She was baffled by Kyla’s audacity to interfere in her life, boldly taking it upon herself to dictate her actions at work!
Meanwhile, Kyla adopted the facade of an aggrieved innocent. Her eyes were tinged with red, yet her tone stayed soothing and calm.
“Sadie, don’t take this the wrong way. I’m only doing what’s best for you. You’ve been sick and overworking yourself. I just don’t want you to collapse from exhaustion. “Noah and I talked it over, and this is what we decided. Isn’t that right, Noah?”
As the words left her lips, she glanced at Noah with feigned helplessness, as if seeking support, though no one had realized when he had arrived at the door.
Noah, distinguished in a sharply tailored black suit that highlighted his stern posture and cold aura, gave a noncommittal “mm-hmm” before advising, “Pushing yourself while you’re unwell won’t do anyone any favors—it’ll just add to the company’s burden.”

###Chapter 43:
Sadie cast her gaze downward, masking the bitterness and despair swirling in her eyes, and murmured in a hushed tone, “Understood, Mr. Wall.”
Observing her distress, Tina quickly closed the distance between them, tenderly grasping Sadie’s hand and whispering, “Sadie, it’s really okay to take a break. Don’t overthink it. Remember, your health comes first.”
With a strained smile, Sadie tightened her grip on Tina’s hand, expressing her gratitude. “Thanks, Tina. I appreciate your concern.”
With no further obligations at work, Sadie decided it was time to leave for her grandma’s place, where she would stay for a while. In a world that often felt lonely, Laura was her only family and the only light that kept her heart warm.
As she gathered her things, memories of the earlier confrontations haunted her—Noah’s aloofness, Kyla’s gloating, and the inquisitive stares from her colleagues felt like daggers to her soul, suffocating her spirit.
“Sadie?” Laura’s eyes widened in surprise as she saw Sadie. “What are you doing here?”
Having just wrapped up a line dancing class with her close friends, Laura entered her kitchen to find Sadie unexpectedly standing there, holding a spatula.
Sadie mustered a strained smile as she arranged the stir-fried vegetables on the plate, her movements deliberate, aiming to project calm. “Grandma, I made some dishes for you! Come taste them and tell me what you think.”
Laura regarded Sadie with a gentle, perceptive look as she placed her palm fan beside her on the table. She hadn’t even touched her food when she pinned Sadie with a deep, penetrating stare, as though she could unravel all the secrets Sadie was trying to hide.
Feeling a tingle of unease under Laura’s intense scrutiny, Sadie maintained her poise. She served a bowl of shrimp and grits—Laura’s favorite—and attempted to steer the conversation away from the tension. “Grandma, please have some. I remember how much you used to enjoy my shrimp and grits.”
Yet Laura wasn’t swayed by the diversion. She continued to study Sadie with a solemn expression, and her voice was slow and measured when she finally spoke. “Sadie, did something happen between you and that young man, Alex?”
g?lnσνs．c?, a world of tales
At the mention of Alex, a flicker of discomfort crossed Sadie’s face, and her grip on the fork tightened imperceptibly. She conjured a light, dismissive smile and reassured Laura. “Grandma, everything’s fine. Please, don’t worry about it.”
“Sadie,” Laura responded with a mix of firmness and affection, “I might not be as sharp or as capable as I once was, and there’s only so much I can do for you, but promise me this—don’t ever let anyone hurt you. If your heart is heavy, just come home. I’m always here, waiting.”
Instead of challenging Sadie’s pretense, Laura simply extended her hand and clasped Sadie’s, her fingers warm against Sadie’s chill. Her voice was soft yet unwavering, a testament to her unconditional support.
Overwhelmed, Sadie could no longer contain her emotions. Her nose tingled as tears surged, blurring her vision, and she choked out a barely audible, “Grandma…”
Laura, her heart swelling with tenderness, drew Sadie into a warm embrace, her hand gently patting her back in a comforting rhythm reminiscent of Sadie’s childhood. Softly, she murmured, “Look at you, my dear, still so quick to cry just like when you were a little girl.”
Nestled against Laura’s shoulder, Sadie found solace in the familiar, soothing scent of lavender soap, a fragrance that always seemed to calm her storms.noveldrama
She took a deep, shuddering breath, trying to still the chaotic whirlwind of her emotions.
Now wasn’t the time to break—she had to stay strong.
For her unborn child’s sake, Sadie knew she had to act fast to secure the funds needed for a safe delivery and a fresh start.

###Chapter 44:
Leaving Wall Group was a move she had to make.
The painful memories and the shadows of a fractured family that clung to this city were too much to bear.
There was no way in hell Noah would ever accept the existence of her child!
In the chaos of her mind, a sudden idea struck Sadie like lightning.
The Maple Group’s collaboration project—this could be her lifeline!
That project was highly profitable, and the planning department had been unable to secure it. If she could secure this project, it could mean not just a significant bonus, but also a chance to break away from Wall Group and rebuild her career in design.
A resolute spark ignited in Sadie’s eyes as she flung open her laptop, plunging into the depths of research about the Maple Group. The bluish hue from the screen bathed her face, casting her determined features in sharp relief.
“Got it!” she exclaimed triumphantly, her voice slicing through the silence as she snapped the laptop shut. The light flickered across her sharp, intent gaze, a testament to her sudden insight.
The morning whirled by as Sadie pieced together bits of intel on Roy Dominguez, the enigmatic CEO of Maple Group.
Her breakthrough came just before noon: Roy was slated for an afternoon of golf, aiming to unwind at a local club.
With no time to spare, Sadie threw essentials into her bag and darted out, her heart pounding with anticipation.
Her arrival at the golf course was perfectly timed, just minutes before two.
She exhaled a deep breath of relief and surveyed the upscale surroundings, yet Roy was nowhere to be seen.
Just as she stepped forward, a skeptical voice halted her. “Miss, do you have a reservation?”
Explore more on gα?ησν?s﹒
The staff member’s eyes swept over Sadie’s casual attire—a plain white T-shirt and jeans—looking completely out of place amid the venue’s usual glamour.
Sadie drew in a deep, steadying breath, steeling herself against any sign of vulnerability.
“I am Mr. Noah Wall’s secretary from Wall Group,” she declared, her voice a calm blend of composure and firm conviction. “He has sent me to discuss a potential collaboration with Mr. Dominguez from Maple Group.”
The staff member’s expression shifted dramatically, the initial wariness melting away to be replaced by respectful acknowledgment.
“Oh, you’re with Mr. Wall. I apologize for missing that.” With newfound courteousness, the staff member beamed and gestured ahead. “Right this way, please.”
Releasing a hushed sigh of relief, Sadie followed, her heart lightening with each step.
The golf course sprawled before her, a landscape tinged with familiarity—she had traversed these greens before alongside Noah, lending her a comforting sense of déjà vu.
Choosing a secluded bench, she settled down, extracting a meticulously prepared business proposal from her bag. She scanned the surroundings with practiced ease, her anticipation building quietly. Roy showed up soon after, accompanied by just a secretary. His arrival confirmed the intelligence she had gathered.
With no clients in sight, Roy appeared to be here purely for a leisurely day on the course, making her job a breeze.
Sadie drew a deep breath, steeling herself as she made her way toward Roy, who was leisurely sipping his coffee.
She offered him a measured smile, the kind meticulously practiced for professionalism.
“Hello, Mr. Dominguez. I’m Sadie Hudson, Mr. Wall’s secretary.” She introduced herself with a calm, dignified air.

###Chapter 45:
Roy glanced up, his eyes momentarily lighting up with an unspoken appreciation for Sadie, before he swiftly masked it with a neutral expression.
After all, Sadie was no stranger; she had been a constant, though subtle, fixture by Noah’s side for the past two years, her presence as elegant and unobtrusive as a finely crafted piece of decor.
With a nonchalant smile, Roy responded, “Ah, Miss Hudson, what a pleasant surprise. Is Mr. Wall accompanying you today?” His eyes flicked around the place, feigning casual interest in the area, but secretly searching for Noah.
Maintaining her composed facade, Sadie was ready with her response. She extended the business proposal—a document she had refined tirelessly—to him. Her voice was firm, perfectly balanced between respect and assertion.
“Mr. Dominguez, I’m here to present this business proposal on Mr. Wall’s behalf. He values our prior cooperation highly. He mentioned concerns about the planning department’s flaws in details, prompting him to send me personally to ensure you receive this,” she explained, her gaze steady.
Roy gave the business plan a brief glance, his expression unreadable, before setting it aside without opening it. His smile was thin, almost forced, as he responded, “Miss Hudson, I came here today to unwind, not to get tangled up in business talks.”
His gaze lifted, sharp and assessing, as he subtly dismissed her efforts. “And please tell Mr. Wall that it’s best to leave bygones as bygones. There’s no point in lingering on it.”
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat, but she wasn’t ready to back down. Drawing in a steady breath to calm her rising nerves, she proactively dove into Maple Group’s current dynamics.
“Mr. Dominguez, our partnership for this quarter is nearing its conclusion, and Maple Group is actively exploring alliances that align better with your vision,” she stated, maintaining a poised, professional demeanor. Her eyes, however, flickered with a hint of desperation. “Given Wall Group’s solid infrastructure, it’s ideally suited to bolster Maple Group’s ambitious expansion strategies.”
She paused for effect, her tone earnest. “Mr. Dominguez, I urge you to consider our proposal. I’m confident it could shift your perspective.”
g?lnσν?s?com is your storytelling haven
Sadie knew this moment was pivotal—not just for her, but for Wall Group as well.
The line between success and failure was perilously thin.
Sadie articulated her thoughts with such precision and conviction that Roy, previously dismissive, now appeared markedly taken aback.
His slender fingers drummed a steady, rhythmic beat on the tabletop, each tap echoing in sync with Sadie’s own pulsing heart.noveldrama
Roy finally opened the business proposal and skimmed through its contents. While the proposal was generally in line with his expectations, it was much more detailed and presented numerous insightful recommendations that would undoubtedly benefit Maple Group.
With each page he turned, his eyebrows drew together tighter, signaling his escalating skepticism.
This proposal showcased an intricate understanding of Maple Group’s operations and astutely forecasted potential partnerships, a level of insight not typically expected of an average secretary.
“Well, about this proposal…” Roy began, hesitating as he closed the document. His sharp eyes locked onto Sadie’s. “Did you put this together by yourself?”
Remaining outwardly composed, Sadie felt her heart pounding fiercely beneath her chest.
She clenched her delicate fingers so tightly that a thin layer of sweat dampened her palms.
Originally, she had devised this proposal to lighten Noah’s burden.
With the invaluable insights she had gathered from him about the Maple Group, she managed to assemble a detailed and strategic plan. Yet, she had never dared to present it to Noah, held back by the fear that he might view her initiative as presumptuous.

###Chapter 46:
Now, lured by the promising bonus tied to the project, she felt compelled to dive headfirst into the challenge.
Roy mulled over the situation briefly, his fingers drumming a thoughtful rhythm on the polished tabletop before he addressed her with a measured calmness. “Please, take a seat, Miss Hudson. Did Mr. Wall himself put this proposal together?”
The slight arch of his eyebrow betrayed his surprise, offering Sadie a moment of relief as she felt a burden lift from her shoulders. She sensed the odds were finally tilting in her favor this time, yet, given the circumstances, she was well aware that the biggest share of credit had to be Noah’s.noveldrama
It was absurd to think a mere secretary could stand for the entirety of the Wall Group.
With a restrained smile, Sadie nodded in acknowledgment. “Mr. Dominguez, your discernment is commendable. Yes, Mr. Wall did this personally. Unfortunately, he’s not feeling well today, so he sent me in his place. I trust everything is to your satisfaction?”
Her voice maintained its composure, but beneath the surface, a subtle bitterness simmered.
For Noah’s sake, she had set aside her own ambitions, satisfied with lifting him up from behind the scenes. Yet, when all was said and done, she remained unnamed, her contributions silently acknowledged but never celebrated.
Roy gave a small nod, gently returning the proposal to the table, his expression betraying a hint of admiration as he regarded Sadie.
“Miss Hudson, with someone as capable as you by Mr. Wall’s side, things must run a lot smoother. I’m inclined to take a closer look at this project. Could you walk me through it in more detail?”
The knot of anxiety in Sadie’s stomach loosened at Roy’s encouraging tone.
She flashed him a composed, confident smile and replied smoothly, “Absolutely, Mr. Dominguez. Let me delve into the specifics of our proposal.”
g?lnσνsо opens doors to wonder
Her voice was soft but clear, her words meticulously chosen as she unfolded the intricacies of the proposal, sprinkling her explanation with insightful observations that seemed to resonate with Roy, who nodded appreciatively at her points.
As Sadie reveled in her growing sense of accomplishment, she remained blissfully unaware of two familiar figures gradually closing the distance behind her.
“Noah.” Kyla’s voice floated in the air, tinged with excitement. “I heard there’s a new restaurant over at Elmsgate. Shall we try it tonight?” She clung affectionately to Noah’s arm, her tone playful and inviting. Noah’s response, however, was absent. His gaze was intensely fixed on the graceful figure a short distance away.
Sadie was dressed in a chic, understated professional suit, her long hair swept up into an elegant bun that accentuated her delicate neck. She radiated a poised blend of competence and grace.
At that instant, she sat partially turned away, a slight confident smile playing at the corners of her mouth as she engaged in a spirited exchange with Roy.
This was a side of Sadie that Noah had never witnessed before.
Kyla’s eyes darted covertly towards Sadie, a sly smirk barely visible on her face.
She brought a hand to her mouth, feigning shock. “Noah, are my eyes deceiving me? Is that Sadie? What on earth is she doing here?”
Noah remained silent, his intense gaze fixed on Roy, who was engaged in an eager conversation with Sadie. A shadow of doubt flitted across his expression.
Kyla’s jealousy surged unchecked when she saw Noah’s attention so fixed on Sadie. Her emotions morphed into simmering anger.
She grasped Noah’s arm, her voice laced with feigned surprise. “Noah, is Sadie really discussing business with Mr. Dominguez? But I thought Wall Group wasn’t collaborating with Maple Group right now, or am I mistaken?”
“Kyla.” Noah’s brow furrowed, the displeasure in his tone unmistakable.

###Chapter 47:
Kyla, seemingly unaware of his growing irritation, leaned in with a teasing smirk. “Could it be there’s something between Sadie and Mr. Dominguez?”
She paused dramatically, her voice dripping with insinuation. “But isn’t Mr. Dominguez quite a bit older? Does that really not bother Sadie?”
The air around Noah seemed to chill, his eyes narrowing into icy slits as he fixed a stern look on Kyla. “Enough with the nonsense.”
Despite the warning, a thrill ran through Kyla, her pulse quickening.
She stifled a giggle, her hand lightly covering her mouth as she hurried to keep pace with Noah’s brisk strides, her high heels clicking against the floor. Her eyes twinkled with mischief, as she relished the stir she’d caused.
Roy caught sight of them first. Despite his fifty-plus years, his presence was distinguished and vibrant. He stood gracefully, greeting Noah with a warm, calculated smile and an outstretched hand.
“Mr. Wall, I thought you were not feeling well. Why did you come in person?” Sadie hadn’t anticipated running into these two, and her features twisted into an awkward mask of surprise.
Noah’s eyes briefly scanned the business proposal sprawled across the table before settling on Roy, who maintained an inscrutable facade. In that instant, Noah’s sharp instincts kicked in, whispering that the situation was laced with complexity.
He parted his lips to speak, but Sadie, quick on the uptake, interjected, “Mr. Wall, how are you feeling today?” Her voice was laced with a genuine tint of concern. “I didn’t expect you to come in person. It seems you hold the partnership with Maple Group in high regard.”
Her words cleverly offered Noah a hint, as she acknowledged that her own bold moves had orchestrated today’s meeting. Nonetheless, if this secured the partnership with Maple Group, Wall Group would benefit just as much.
Noah, ever the astute businessman, caught her implications without missing a beat.

He nodded, his response firm yet infused with undeniable gravitas. “My apologies, Mr. Dominguez, for not arriving sooner.”
Kyla’s lips curled into a tight, almost imperceptible sneer, her eyes glinting with a flicker of disdain. She had seen through the charade; today’s high-stakes negotiation was all Sadie’s doing.
And now, Sadie was deftly passing the responsibility, forcing Noah to untangle the web she had woven—what a strategic move.
Kyla watched as Noah maintained a stoically indifferent facade. There was no sign he intended to derail Sadie’s plan, and Kyla couldn’t help but smirk inwardly.
It appeared Sadie had managed to coax even the typically calculating Noah into bending the rules just for her.
Roy and Noah had already taken their respective places on the plush sofas, poised to dive into their business discussion.
Roy leaned forward with a warm smile, his eyes twinkling with genuine admiration. “Mr. Wall, I must say, your secretary is quite remarkable. So young, yet she grasps the intricacies of the project like a seasoned pro. It’s a rare find,” he noted, his voice rich with sincerity as he nodded towards Sadie. “You’ve really landed yourself an extraordinary talent there!”
Sadie allowed herself a small, humble smile in response. Her voice was soft yet confident as she replied, “Mr. Dominguez, you’re too kind. I’m just fulfilling my responsibilities and continually learning from Mr. Wall.”
Her posture remained impeccable, a testament to her professionalism, as she anticipated the successful closure of their discussion, which would, in turn, secure her a well-deserved bonus.
The mere thought sparked a subtle gleam of anticipation in her eyes.noveldrama
On the sidelines, Kyla observed the exchange, her heart simmering with envy.
There was no way in hell she was going to stand there and let Sadie steal the spotlight!

###Chapter 48:
Taking a deep, calming breath to quell the rising storm of indignation, Kyla masked her frustration with a practiced, serene smile and sat next to Noah with graceful nonchalance. Her voice was light, almost airy, as she chimed in, “Mr. Dominguez, perhaps there’s been a slight misunderstanding. In truth, Noah was the one behind this proposal. Sadie was merely assisting in its delivery. The main thing, of course, is your satisfaction with the work.”
Her words, wrapped in a veil of politeness, were designed not just to set the record straight but to subtly diminish Sadie’s role to that of a simple intermediary.
Roy, a seasoned judge of character from years of encountering diverse personalities, swiftly grasped the hidden intentions in Kyla’s cautious words. With a discerning glance, his features subtly shifted to a frown, reflecting his displeasure.noveldrama
He was no stranger to whispers of Kyla’s past with Noah, and her recent reappearance had already sparked rumors among their circles. Despite Noah’s lingering affection for his former lover, Roy was resolute in disregarding her.
Roy cleared his throat pointedly, his gaze piercing as it swept across Noah and Kyla, finally anchoring on Noah with a significant weight. “Mr. Wall, I would appreciate a moment to discuss our potential collaboration in private at your earliest convenience. Given that you have company today, perhaps we should postpone our conversation.” His words hung heavy in the air, amplifying the tension.
Kyla’s expression hardened, a mix of regret and embarrassment crossing her features as she realized her misstep had soured the mood. Just as she was gearing up to defuse the tension, Roy abruptly stood and exited the room.
Sadie’s voice faltered. “Mr. Dominguez…” She watched, a blend of anxiety and frustration brewing within her, as her chance to secure the deal seemed to vanish with his departure. Yet she restrained her emotions before Noah. Powerless, she could only look at Roy’s retreating figure.
When Roy was out of sight, Sadie turned towards Noah, her expression one of bewilderment. She ventured cautiously, “Mr. Wall, this moment could be crucial for finalizing our cooperation. Perhaps you could still…”
She was cut off mid-sentence by Noah’s frosty voice. “Sadie, who authorized you to approach Mr. Dominguez on your own?”
Feel the magic at gα?ησν?s?cο
Stunned, Sadie felt a tight grip around her heart, a creeping dull ache spreading across her chest.
“Noah, please, don’t be too harsh on Sadie,” Kyla remarked, her voice a gentle murmur, seemingly protective yet tinged with a hint of criticism.
As she spoke, she edged closer to Noah, her arm lightly brushing against his, suggesting intimacy as she added, “She meant well for the company, though perhaps her methods strayed from our usual protocols, right?”
Noah’s brow creased with a slight frown, and though he subtly shifted away from Kyla’s touch, he remained silent, not contesting her statement.
Turning away, Sadie averted her eyes, unable to bear the discomfort of the exchange.
The fierce sunlight enveloped her, but failed to thaw the coldness seeping into her soul.
While Sadie buried herself in the proposal, pouring her heart and soul into the work, Noah was busy enjoying himself with the love of his life. The absurdity of the situation wasn’t lost on her.
Taking a measured breath to quell the storm raging inside, Sadie addressed him with a veneer of composure. “Mr. Wall, our company has always placed great importance on the Maple Group project. When we manage to secure the deal, I trust you’ll remember the bonus you promised.”
Noah’s gaze turned sharp, his eyes a deep abyss, difficult to read.
So, it all boiled down to the bonus for Sadie. Was this her calculated move to cut ties? To think she planned her exit with such meticulous care!
Unable to bear the sight of Noah and Kyla’s closeness, Sadie decided to leave.
She swiftly picked up the proposal document from the table, tucked it into her bag, and turned to leave. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 49:
“Sadie!” The authority in Noah’s voice echoed in the tense air.
Sadie stopped dead in her tracks, inhaled deeply to steady her nerves, and turned around. Her lips, a striking shade of red, parted ever so slightly. With a voice that carried a steady resolve, yet trembled ever so subtly, she asked, “Mr. Wall, is there anything else you need?”
Kyla cast a wary glance at Noah, trying to gauge his thoughts. His rage was palpable, radiating in waves that filled the room. She surmised it was sparked by Sadie’s daring behavior.
“Sadie, every organization abides by its own set of rules. I trust you’ll refrain from disregarding our company’s guidelines in the future,” Kyla said, her voice soft yet imbued with an authoritative firmness. It looked like she already considered herself the CEO’s wife. “As a consequence of your actions, your bonus for this project will be withheld.”
Sadie’s response was swift and fierce. She jerked her head up, her gaze icy as she fixed Kyla with a cold, challenging stare. Her delicate features were twisted in fury, her teeth gritted. “What right do you have to make this decision?” she demanded sharply.
Ignoring the tension, Kyla subtly leaned against Noah, her posture feigning vulnerability. Her eyes brimmed with tears as she looked up at him imploringly. “Noah, did I do something wrong? Imagine the chaos if everyone at Wall Group behaved as she did.”
Noah’s response came as a dismissive snort, his voice laced with a clear edge of impatience. “I have to agree with Kyla—Sadie, you really did mess up here.”
Sadie’s fingers clenched around her bag, the sharp press of her nails against her palm unnoticed in her rising agitation.
She had poured her heart into this project, aiming to impress Roy and shift the tide in her favor. Yet here she was, on the brink of losing everything because of Kyla’s remarks.
“Noah, it appears Sadie is opposed to this punishment,” Kyla murmured, her voice a mask of regret, though her eyes told a different story. “However, without it, we risk setting a precedent that might lead others to disregard our policies.”
gα?ησν?s?cо, your storytelling home
“Mr. Wall,” Sadie interjected, her restraint evaporating as she faced Noah directly. Her features hardened with resolve, each word tinged with a quiet ferocity. “If I’m denied the bonus for this project, then consider the proposal for Mr. Dominguez withdrawn. If he pushes for more details, don’t expect me to back you up.”
In that moment, Sadie realized she would rather face the repercussions than watch Noah reap the benefits of her diligence. Why should she be the one to endure such injustice? All she desired was a modest bonus to ease her and her child’s life after the divorce.
Why the hell couldn’t Noah just let her have this one?
With a heavy heart and no desire to linger, Sadie turned and walked away, each step echoing her profound disappointment.
Sadie’s high heels clicked sharply against the floor, each step echoing like a mockery of her misplaced confidence.
Kyla watched as Sadie walked away, a smug smile curling the corners of her lips. Her eyes and brows sparkled with uncontained triumph, as if she was savoring a small but sweet victory. “Noah, how could Sadie say that?” she asked, her voice tinged with grievance and accusation. “She works for Wall Group, so naturally, her project proposal belongs to the company.”
Noah’s gaze followed Sadie’s departure, his expression inscrutable. He gently removed Kyla’s hand, containing his inner conflict, and said softly, “Kyla, go home.”
Kyla’s smile faltered, her perfectly groomed eyebrows knitting together in frustration. She wasn’t ready to leave, not like this. It had taken so much effort to convince Noah to spend time with her, only for Sadie to ruin everything.
Suppressing her irritation, Kyla leaned in close, her arm wrapping around Noah’s with feigned tenderness. “Noah, let me stay with you. It’s been so hard for us to get back together…” Her voice was sweet but carried a hint of reproach, as if blaming Noah for their scarce moments together.

###Chapter 50:
Noah deftly stepped away from her touch. “I’ll make time for us soon,” he assured her, his tone even and firm.
Before Kyla could say anything more, Noah walked away, his silhouette merging with the golden sunset, his presence marked by a cool detachment.
Kyla’s lips quivered slightly as she pressed her nails into her palm, seemingly unaware of the pain. She hadn’t anticipated such complications; Sadie was indeed a relentless problem!
Meanwhile, Sadie stepped out of the golf course, only to find herself surrounded by silence. The area was desolate, with no taxis in sight; it felt like a forgotten corner of the world.
Sadie’s stomach churned painfully, a stark reminder that the single piece of bread she’d eaten for lunch had done little to sustain her. The confrontation with Noah and Kyla had left her emotionally and physically drained, her body trembling with dizziness and exhaustion.
As she thought about her lost bonus, a fresh wave of frustration crashed over her. Her vision blurred, her legs buckled, and before she could steady herself, she collapsed onto the ground. Tears spilled down her cheeks, hot and unbidden.
What had she done to deserve this? She was bewildered by the harshness of her situation.
As Noah stepped outside, he instantly noticed Sadie’s plight. A flicker of surprise crossed his usually stern face, and his eyebrows furrowed involuntarily. “What is she doing now?” he muttered.
But as Noah took in Sadie’s pale face and her lips pressed tightly together, as though she were fighting to hold back the pain, something inside him softened. Almost instinctively, he found himself walking toward her. Before he could second-guess his actions, he stood right before her.
Sadie’s stomach lurched painfully, and before she could stop herself, she bent over, retching violently and spitting out a mouthful of stomach acid.
Noah’s frown deepened, an unfamiliar emotion tightening his chest, something he couldn’t quite place.
galnσνs?c?m opens doors to new adventures
Noah crouched beside Sadie, his brows drawn together. “Sadie, what’s wrong?” His voice was steady, but a faint, almost hidden hint of concern was beneath it.
Sadie fought to raise her head, her surroundings spinning as her vision blurred. She could barely make out Noah’s face through the fog of dizziness, but his features were still as perfect as ever, like a precision-made sculpture. But this time, his expression had an unfamiliar softness, a hint of concern that confused her.
“Noah…” Sadie’s voice trembled, barely audible.
Feeling a clench in his heart, Noah didn’t hesitate; he lifted Sadie into his arms.
As the world seemed to whirl around her, Sadie soon found herself cradled in a warm, yet strange, embrace.
She inhaled deeply, a blend of perfume and a trace of tobacco filling her senses — a scent that was unmistakably Noah’s.
“Noah, what are you doing?” Sadie asked, trying to wriggle free, but his grip only tightened.
“Stay still. We’re heading to the hospital,” Noah commanded, his expression severe, tolerating no opposition.
Confusion swirled within her once more, deep and perplexing. “I don’t want to go to the hospital!” The word “hospital” alone set Sadie on edge. She shoved hard against Noah’s chest. “Put me down!”
Without hesitation, Noah lifted her into the car and said to the driver, “Take us to the hospital.”
“I don’t want to go to the hospital! Let me out!” Sadie cried out, her voice edged with desperation and despair.

###Chapter 51:
Observing her ashen face and the defiant look in her eyes, Noah felt a surge of frustration. He firmly grasped her shoulders, his voice stern and urgent. “Sadie, stop this nonsense! If you felt unwell, why did you even meet with Roy?”
Pinned by his firm hold, Sadie ceased her struggles.
A sarcastic laugh escaped her, filled with self-derision. “What does it matter at this point? Wasn’t my bonus already cut? Today was just a futile effort on my part. So tell me, are you pleased now?”
Noah noticed the bitterness in Sadie’s gaze, and without thinking, his hold grew firmer, his tone colder. “Is your rush to accumulate wealth tied to your eagerness for a divorce?”
The pain in Sadie’s heart intensified as she looked into the eyes of the man she once adored, now confronting her so harshly. It felt as if needles were piercing through her heart, causing a deep, persistent ache.noveldrama
Could it be that his frustration stemmed from a reluctance to end their marriage? Unlikely, considering Kyla was anxiously awaiting her turn to be his wife. How could Noah stand to disappoint the woman he loved?
As these thoughts raced through her mind, any faint hope Sadie clung to crumbled to nothing.
With a bitter chuckle and tears welling up in her eyes—yet defiantly not spilling over—Sadie forcefully removed Noah’s hands.
Her voice was steady and resolute, each word pushed out between gritted teeth. “Why deceive yourself? You’re just as keen for this divorce, aren’t you? Here’s your chance, right before you.”
The certainty in her eyes pierced Noah, kindling an unexplainable wave of irritation within him.
“Halt the vehicle,” Sadie commanded. Her tone was not loud, but unmistakably firm.
The driver caught Noah’s reflection in the rearview mirror. With no sign of dissent from Noah, he pulled the car over to the roadside. Sadie didn’t hesitate; she opened the door and exited the car immediately.
Your imagination begins with gα?ησν?s﹒
“Sadie!” Noah called out as he watched her resolute departure, feeling a rush of anger swelling in his heart.
She didn’t turn back. With purposeful steps, Sadie reached the curb, flagged down a taxi with quick, sure motions, and climbed in without a backward glance.
As the taxi blended into the night, Noah’s expression darkened significantly. He had always expected her to softly plead with him as she used to, but this time, she had not!
The cold within the car was evident, as Noah’s cold aura unsettled everyone.
In the passenger seat, Samuel sat rigid, acutely aware that any word from him could provoke Noah’s anger due to his terrible mood.
Silence hung heavy until Samuel tentatively broke it, saying, “Mr. Wall, should we continue on to Maple Group? I have already made an appointment with Mr. Dominguez.”
Noah, feeling a throb in his temples, gave a brief nod and muttered, “Drive.”
Samuel exhaled quietly in relief and signaled to the driver to move forward.
Meanwhile, Sadie, afraid of worrying Laura with her condition, returned to her apartment.
As soon as she exited the vehicle, a wave of nausea struck her hard, making her head spin.
Her sickness was more intense today, possibly aggravated by her scant lunch, unsettling the baby.
Supporting herself against the wall, Sadie retched a few times but didn’t vomit anything; she only felt painful cramps in her stomach. Gradually, she regained some balance and walked weakly to her apartment. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 52:
The tiny apartment had barely any furniture, but it was spotless and neatly kept.
Still, an undeniable loneliness hung in the air, echoing Sadie’s mood. Shaking off the feeling, she headed to the kitchen and made a bowl of mac and cheese.
The dish was bland, and the sauce was dull, but consuming the warm meal slowly helped her feel slightly better.
Sadie reclined in her chair, one hand resting on her still-flat belly as a wry smile touched her lips.
The light outside began to fade as the night deepened.
Then, a sharp ringtone pierced her reverie.
It was the unique ringtone she had set for Laura.
Swiftly, Sadie picked up the call. “Hello, Grandma?”
Instead of Laura, an unfamiliar voice, urgent and slightly panicked, responded, “Is this a family member of Mrs. Stewart? She has suffered a sudden heart attack and is now in critical condition at the hospital. You need to come immediately!”
Sadie’s mind turned to white noise. The phone fell to the floor, landing with a soft thud.
Her grandma had a heart attack? How was that possible?
Moments later, Sadie snapped back to reality. She quickly picked up her phone, slipped into her shoes, and rushed out of her apartment.
On the way to the hospital, the doctor’s urgent message replayed incessantly in her head, constricting her heart like a vice, making it hard to catch her breath.
Laura was everything to her, her only family, her pillar in life. Nothing could happen to her, nothing at all!
Sadie’s high heels echoed sharply against the hospital’s polished floors as she raced through the corridors, her heartbeat thundering just as wildly.
“Grandma! Grandma!”

She surged forward, gasping for air but not slowing down, and headed towards the nurse’s station. Grasping a nurse’s arm with shaking hands, her voice thick with tears, she pleaded, “Excuse me, my grandmother, Laura Stewart, was just brought in by ambulance. Where is she? I’m her granddaughter!”
The nurse, skilled in handling such crises, maintained a stoic expression, her voice even and professional as she responded with a slight furrow of her brow, “Please try to remain calm. Your grandmother is in critical care, and things aren’t looking great right now.”
As the nurse’s words sank in, Sadie’s vision blurred, each syllable like a hammer blow shattering the fragile hope she clung to.
Just then, the resuscitation room doors burst open, and a grave-looking doctor clad in a white coat stepped out, clutching a document. Sadie instantly knew what it was—a Critical Condition Notice. Darkness clouded her vision, and she nearly collapsed, but the alert nurse at her side caught her in time.
The doctor, his face somber as he lowered his mask, spoke with deep regret. “Your grandmother’s pre-existing health conditions compounded the severity of this attack. We’ve exhausted all our options…”
“Doctor, please, there must be something you can do to save her,” Sadie pleaded desperately, her hands clasping the doctor’s arm as if it were her last strand of hope. “I’ll cover any cost. Just please, save her!”
The doctor’s eyes softened with sympathy for a moment before he shook his head. “It’s not a question of money. She’s in a precarious state unless…”noveldrama
He hesitated, searching for the right words. “If we could bring in a top specialist to attempt the surgery, there might still be hope.”
A top specialist.
Noah immediately sprang to mind. 
.

.
###Chapter 53:
With his extensive connections as CEO of Wall Group, securing a top surgeon should be feasible.
Sadie’s heart clenched painfully as panic set in.
She fumbled for her phone and dialed Noah’s number, her fingers shaking.
Each ring echoed like a tolling bell in her ears, every tick of the clock magnified.
At last, the call connected.
“Noah, be gentle…”
The voice that floated through the phone was sultry, infused with a lazy allure that sank Sadie’s heart into despair.
It wasn’t Noah on the line—it was Kyla!
Sadie’s mind went completely blank.
After a while, Kyla spoke into the phone. “Sadie, calling at this hour? Is there something you needed to discuss?”
Sadie inhaled sharply, fighting to stabilize the emotional storm brewing inside her. “I need to speak with Noah. Could you please hand him the phone?”
“Oh?” Kyla chuckled, her voice dripping with taunting. “Noah, your phone.”
But all Sadie heard was silence.
Kyla’s voice turned playful and teasing. “Noah—” Yet again, there was no reply.
“My apologies, Sadie,” Kyla said, her tone superficially regretful yet tinged with evident delight. “Noah’s currently in the shower. We’ve just finished… Well, he’s exhausted now. If there’s something urgent, you can tell me, and I’ll make sure he gets the message.”
Sadie felt a crushing wave of despair wash over her. She grasped the subtext in Kyla’s remarks instantly.
Shower? Exhausted?
Kyla’s comments were a clear display of her closeness with Noah, meant to emphasize that Sadie was someone insignificant.
Yet, with her grandmother’s critical condition looming in her mind, Sadie couldn’t afford to lose any hope.
“Miss Wade, it’s really important. Could you please let Noah come to the phone?” Sadie pleaded, mustering every bit of her resolve to speak. Her voice was tinged with desperation, a far cry from her typically assertive demeanor.
Kyla’s sense of triumph intensified when she heard Sadie’s earnest request, her smile widening. “Sadie, haven’t you realized yet? Noah isn’t coming to the phone because he doesn’t want to speak with you. Why continue bothering him?”
“Um…” Sadie began, but was cut off by the call ending abruptly with a beep.
Kyla swiftly erased the call log and set the phone down before heading downstairs.
She had merely used Noah’s bathroom and coincidentally picked up the call.
It seemed destiny had played its hand perfectly!
“Miss Hudson, please ensure the Critical Condition Notice is signed promptly,” said the nurse, her voice laden with urgency.
Yet Sadie barely registered the nurse’s words, her eyes fixed on the resuscitation room’s sealed doors, lost in memories of Laura’s warm, reassuring smile.
As Sadie signed the Critical Condition Notice, her hands shook visibly.
The cold feeling started at her fingertips and spread through her entire body, as if a cold winter wind had swept through her. Laura represented her last remaining family connection.
Without Laura, isolation would envelop Sadie completely.noveldrama
She felt as though she had reached a dead end.
Just as despair started to take over, Alex’s words suddenly rang in her mind. “If you ever need help, just let me know.” 
.

###Chapter 54:
With this last sliver of hope, Sadie hurriedly dialed Alex’s number.
“Alex, are you familiar with any specialists in cardiac surgery?”
The conversation ended, and Sadie found herself curled up on a hospital bench, her tears blurring her view until everything melded into indistinct shapes.
She barely noticed when someone gently placed a warm suit jacket over her. Looking up, she found Alex standing there, concern furrowing his brow.
“You came,” Sadie said, her voice breaking with emotion. “It’s my grandma. She’s…”
A shadow of sorrow passed over Alex’s face as he softly patted her head, comforting her as one would a distressed child.
“Everything will be fine,” he assured her with a deep, soothing voice. “I’ve brought along a doctor.”
He shifted slightly to present the individual next to him to Sadie. “Here is Jim Archer, a renowned cardiologist and a leading expert in Helva.
He’s well-equipped to ensure your grandmother’s well-being.”
Startled, Sadie turned her attention to the man Alex indicated.
At that moment, Jim also glanced her way.
Simultaneously, they both exclaimed, “It’s you?”
Seeing their surprise, Alex was confused. “You two have met before?”
Jim started to speak, but Sadie quickly interjected, “Just once, briefly.” She spoke with a tone of detachment, showing no interest in delving deeper into the topic.
Jim seemed poised to say more, his mouth partway open, yet he merely replied, “I’ll go to the sterilization area and then head straight to the operating room. We don’t have much time. We’ll talk later.” With a light nod from Sadie, he moved to leave.
Alex firmly grasped Jim’s hand, his expression earnest. “Bro, she’s in your hands.”
Jim wore a complex look, caught between various emotions.
New content available now at g?lnσνs?c?m
He knew the significance of Alex’s gesture.
As he made his way to the sterilization area, Jim pondered whether Noah, if he realized that the woman he dismissed was cherished by someone else and on the verge of being claimed, would lose his composure.
Sadie watched Jim depart, feeling a surge of warmth soothe her. She turned to Alex, her voice filled with earnest gratitude. “Thank you, Alex…”
Words seemed insufficient to convey the depth of her gratitude.
But before she could continue, Alex offered her a tissue. “Here, dry your eyes. We wouldn’t want your grandma to see you upset,” he said gently, yet with an assertive undertone.
Sadie accepted the tissue, dabbing gently at her eyes.
The relief was so profound that it momentarily overwhelmed her, causing her to sway a bit from dizziness.
Alex acted quickly to stabilize her.
His hands, firm and warm, conveyed a comforting strength as they made contact through her clothing.
To an onlooker, their interaction might have seemed like an embrace.
Just as Sadie was about to step back and regain her composure, a sharp voice cut through the silence of the corridor. “Oh, Sadie, this is a hospital, not a dating spot.”noveldrama
Sadie was rooted to the spot.
She swiveled toward the source of the voice to find Kyla and Noah a short distance away.
Kyla, clad in a delicate white dress, seemed almost ethereal, as if a mere breeze could shatter her.
Her eyes brimmed with tears, looking as though they could soften the hardest of hearts.

###Chapter 55:
Beside her, Noah stood impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, his handsome features set in a stoic mask.
Confusion clouded Sadie’s thoughts.
What were they doing here?
To Noah, her confusion mirrored guilt.
He approached with a grave expression and said sharply, “I kept trying to get you to the hospital, but you resisted. It seems it wasn’t that you didn’t want to come, but rather that you wanted someone else to be here with you.”
His piercing gaze swept from Alex back to Sadie.
Feeling the growing strain, Alex instinctively positioned himself between Sadie and Noah. “Noah, this isn’t what it looks like. You’re misunderstanding…”
But Noah didn’t let him finish, pushing him aside with a brisk movement.
Alex staggered, catching himself after a few unsteady steps.
Holding back his frustration, Noah seized Sadie’s wrist firmly. “You’re coming with me now.”
He assumed he was emotionally detached from Sadie.
Nevertheless, witnessing her closeness with another man unexpectedly irked him. Noah held onto Sadie’s wrist tightly, causing her to grimace as she attempted to break free.
“I’m not leaving with you! Go alone if you must!” she said firmly.
Her voice was unwavering and clear.
Noah’s temper flared at her words.noveldrama
He stepped forward, seized her waist, and held her close, saying, “You’re coming with me, whether you like it or not!”
Read all updates at g?lnσv?ls?com
Despite her forceful attempts to escape, Sadie was unable to break his hold.
“Noah! Remember, our divorce is imminent. Soon, there will be nothing between us!” she yelled out.
Her declaration momentarily pained Noah, but his anger quickly submerged that sensation.
With a stern expression, he lifted her over his shoulder. “Stop talking! We’ll figure out the future when it comes!”
The pressure of his shoulder against her abdomen sent a jolt of pain through Sadie, causing her to wince.
As Sadie thought of the child she was carrying, her face drained of color.
The way Noah was carrying her posed a risk to the baby.
Realizing the danger, Sadie stopped struggling.
She softened her voice and pleaded, “Set me down, Noah. I promise I’ll follow on foot.”
Seeing Noah’s concern for Sadie sparked a flicker of envy in Kyla, yet she masked it with worry. “Yes, this is a hospital. It wouldn’t look right if people saw.”
Kyla’s remark snapped Noah out of his rage.
He was reminded that he would be divorcing Sadie soon.
Having this scene captured on camera would certainly cast a negative light on him.
After a brief pause, Noah carefully lowered Sadie to the floor, his voice distant and cold. “Let’s go.”
Surprisingly, Sadie swiftly stepped away, saying, “I can’t go.”
Noah’s irritation flared again. “Sadie!”
He advanced to pull her back, but paused as he encountered her pleading look.
Her voice was quiet, almost delicate, as she pleaded, “Noah, please let me go. My grandmother’s surgery is starting soon. Please, let me stay.”

###Chapter 56:
At her words, Noah stopped abruptly and looked at her.
For the first time, he noticed how fragile she seemed, her typically steadfast gaze now brimming with concern.
For a moment, Noah hesitated, his voice tightening as he said, “Why didn’t you…”
He was cut off before he could finish by Kyla, who suddenly gripped her chest and exclaimed, “Ah—Noah, my chest is in so much pain…” Her brows furrowed slightly, as if she was enduring immense pain, trying hard to mask it.
Noah’s concern instantly shifted towards her. He rushed to her side, urgently inquiring, “Are you alright?”
“It hurts,” Kyla whispered faintly, collapsing weakly into Noah’s arms, gasping for air.
Without a second thought, Noah lifted Kyla and quickly headed for the director’s office.
Originally, Noah’s visit to the hospital was meant to be for Kyla’s diagnosis.
The encounter with Sadie was not planned.
Kyla had secretly taken Sadie’s call to Noah and couldn’t let any quick resolution of their misunderstandings happen.
As Noah carried Kyla away, Sadie watched, her heart sinking into deep bitterness. Overwhelmed and drained, she couldn’t afford to ponder their situation any further.
Alex, who had been quietly observing for some time, noticed Sadie’s forced strength, and his heart went out to her.noveldrama
He gently suggested, “Sadie, it’s alright to cry if that’s what you feel like doing.”
“I’m okay,” Sadie replied, shaking her head while her eyes lingered on the operating room’s newly illuminated red light.

She sat back on the bench, silently waiting for the surgery to be over.
Time seemed to blur until Noah and Kyla appeared again.
Noah noticed Sadie from afar, her figure small and delicate on the bench, like a leaf that might be swept away by the wind.
“What’s on your mind?” His voice, cool and detached, reached her. Sadie offered him a brief glance before diverting her eyes, offering no response.
Despite being ignored, Noah didn’t react with his usual irritation. Instead, he chose a spot nearby to sit down, clearly intending to stay. Seeing this, Kyla became anxious. She snuggled closer to Noah, her voice tender. “Noah, it’s really cold. Can we go?”
He nodded briefly, but his gaze landed on the tightly closed doors of the operating room. “I’ll get the driver to take you home,” he responded without emotion.
Kyla’s smile froze, the tension visible in her expression.
Was he planning to stay here with Sadie?
A flare of jealousy ignited within her, but it was quickly concealed as she rose with practiced elegance, her posture unsteady as though she might faint.
“Then, I’ll head back now. It’s cold here. Look after yourself,” she said softly.
Her light coughs added to the fragile illusion she projected.
Noah offered a noncommittal “Hmm,” his gaze never wavering from the operating room’s doors. Reluctantly, Kyla turned to leave.
Sadie, absorbed in her own thoughts, overheard every word they exchanged.
She couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity.
Their open discussion unfolded as if she didn’t exist, as though she were just part of the background.
Her hands clenched into fists, fingernails digging into her palms, yet this physical pain was trivial compared to the emotional turmoil within.
She stroked her abdomen gently, a soft warmth spreading under her fingertips.

###Chapter 57:
In her mind, she hoped her unborn child would understand that their father was not the man they should look up to, and she resolved to leave him before her pregnancy showed.
Catching a glimpse of Kyla lingering in the corridor, Sadie finally broke her silence. “You should go with Kyla.”
Noah’s expression tightened, his eyes flicking to Alex with a derisive edge. “Am I disrupting your moment with your beloved?”
Sadie’s emotions flared, a surge of irritation flooding through her.
“Noah, I’m not at fault here. I called—” she began.
“OUCH!” Her statement was abruptly interrupted by a sharp cry. Kyla had stumbled and fallen, her palm scraping against the floor, turning bright red from the abrasion.
Her ankle had twisted, and tears promptly pooled in her eyes, naturally drawing sympathy.
Noah quickly moved to help her, scolding, “Why weren’t you more careful?”
“It stings a bit, but I’ll handle it. I’ll just use some ointment when I get home…” Kyla managed a weak smile through the pain.
Kneeling beside her, Noah checked the injuries on her palm and her ankle.
His brow furrowed in confusion.
What had caused her sudden fall?
While he considered this, Kyla’s gentle voice floated to him. “Noah, don’t be concerned. The doctor did say that the stress on my heart has been causing insufficient blood flow, which leads to dizziness now and then…”
Noah’s doubt faded after he heard her explanation, replaced by feelings of responsibility.
He recalled that Kyla’s heart issues stemmed from a time when she had saved him.
Your journey begins on g?lnσνes?com
He felt a debt of gratitude.
“I’ll drive you home,” he suggested gently.
Kyla put on a remorseful act, saying, “I’m sorry, Noah. You were supposed to spend time with Sadie. My clumsiness has caused this…” She subtly bit her lip, tears filling her eyes, casting a pitiable figure.
Noah’s gaze darkened as he instinctively looked toward Sadie. Their eyes connected, and Sadie felt a tight clutch around her heart, her breathing stifled.
Determined to avoid being let down by Noah again, she quickly interjected, “You should leave with Kyla.” Her delivery was even and detached.
Noah’s expression tightened, a spark of annoyance flickering.
But considering Kyla’s injuries, he didn’t think twice and said, “Alright.” His reply was brief and cold, lacking any emotional warmth.
Before departing, Noah unexpectedly removed his suit jacket and placed it over Sadie, after smoothly taking Alex’s coat off her shoulders. Sadie’s expression tightened slightly, but she remained silent. With a tender manner, Noah assisted Kyla to the car, his actions gentle, and his look filled with care.
Kyla, supported weakly by Noah, allowed a sly smirk to cross her face. Once settled in the car, Noah pulled out his phone and sent a quick text.
Shortly after, Alex’s phone buzzed.
He checked the message, his expression changing slightly.
“Alex, what’s wrong?” inquired Sadie.
“My grandfather needs me back home immediately,” Alex explained. He hesitated, throwing a concerned look back at Sadie, but he left nonetheless.
Sadie scanned the deserted corridor, feeling a deep sense of solitude envelop her, as though there was no one left in the world she could lean on.
Just when she felt she might give in to despair, the doors to the operating room swung open.

###Chapter 58:
Sadie surged forward instinctively, but her legs, stiff from long hours of sitting, nearly buckled beneath her.
Just in time, a strong, warm hand grasped her arm.
It was Jim.noveldrama
“How is my grandmother?” Sadie asked, her voice shaking heavily with barely contained emotion.
She fixed her gaze on Jim, observing his every gesture and expression.
“She’s out of immediate danger,” Jim responded wearily, his voice conveying relief. “However, she needs to stay in the isolation ward for now and cannot have visitors.”
When Sadie received the update, relief washed over her, tears of happiness streaming down her face as she felt a burden lift.
Jim found it difficult to witness such raw emotion.
He averted his eyes, seemingly pained by the sight.
“I need to make a call,” he muttered.
He walked briskly towards the sterilization room.
Jim removed his gloves and coat before he called Noah.
“Sadie’s at the hospital. You might want to come.”
Jim believed that as Sadie’s husband, Noah should be there to provide support.
“I’ve already been there,” Noah replied flatly.
Jim was momentarily surprised.
Noah had been here? Why hadn’t he noticed him?
“Sadie’s grandmother just made it through a critical procedure, and Sadie’s quite upset…”
L?tτ ?нαρτ?rs ιn glov?ls.
He was about to stress Sadie’s need for comfort when he was interrupted by a woman’s voice through the phone, complaining of pain.
“Ouch… it hurts…”
The flirtatious tone from the other end caused Jim’s thoughts to scatter.
He knitted his brows tightly.
Was that Kyla?
A wave of irritation surged through him.
“Noah,” Jim said coldly, “you may come to regret your choices today.” He ended the call abruptly.
Damn it!
Cursing under his breath, Jim slammed his fist against the wall. How could he have ended up being friends with someone so oblivious to matters of the heart?
On the other end, Noah was left listening to a dial tone, his expression clouding with confusion.
What had he done? Why was Jim so upset?
Kyla watched with barely concealed satisfaction, her voice tender but rough. “It hurts…”
She delicately touched her swollen ankle, feigning a grimace of pain. Noah dismissed his lingering doubts and moved toward Kyla, his voice filled with concern. “Are you still feeling pain?”
Kyla lightly shook her head, her eyes tinged red, portraying a visage of vulnerability and distress.
“Thank you, Noah. I feel much better now,” she murmured appreciatively.
In the meantime, Jim had changed his attire and made his way to the corridor, only to realize Sadie had left.
Sadie, unaware that Jim had sought her out, was preoccupied with the daunting thoughts of Laura’s hospital costs. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 59:
The harsh fluorescent lighting outside the operating room did little to brighten her desolate mood.
For Sadie, Laura was her last remaining relative, indispensable and irreplaceable.
The anticipated bonus from the Maple Group project was her final lifeline.
Regardless of Noah’s decisions concerning the bonus, Sadie was resolved to secure it.noveldrama
She dried her tears, inhaled deeply, and called Roy.
“Mr. Dominguez, is now a good time? I’d like to discuss the project with you again.”
The voice that answered Sadie’s call had a sleazy quality, a far cry from Roy’s usual professional tone.
“Ah, another lady eager to make a deal! Why don’t you drop by the Night Owl Bar, Room 317? Impress us here, and the contract’s as good as yours. Hahaha!”
Laughter echoed through the line, the sound grating on Sadie’s ears.
Anxiety clutched her heart, a cold dread seeping through her.
Left with no alternatives, she conceded.
“I’ll be there soon,” Sadie replied, her voice quivering imperceptibly. As she left the hospital, the cold wind struck her, scattering her hair across her face.
Pressed for time, she bypassed the bus and dismissed the idea of a taxi due to cost.
Resolutely, Sadie headed for the subway.
The car was nearly empty, a relief given the hour.
She found a vacant seat and settled in, her tension easing momentarily. Yet, discomfort soon pricked at her as she felt unsettling stares from around the car.
Curious eyes lingered on Sadie, some intentional, others merely coincidental.
Find the magic on g?lnσν?s?
As she touched her face, Sadie questioned if her makeup was smudged.
“Hey, where did you buy that suit jacket? It’s quite chic and looks expensive. Could you tell me where I might get one?” Suddenly, a voice from a young girl pierced the quiet of the subway car.
It was only then that Sadie remembered she was still wearing Noah’s suit jacket.
Crafted from fine black cashmere, the jacket was luxurious yet subtle.
The urge to remove it came over her, yet she hesitated.
What would she do with it if she took it off? What if it disappeared?
This jacket seemed costly, and she couldn’t risk misplacing it. Smiling uneasily, Sadie said, “Actually, I don’t know where to buy this jacket; it’s not mine.”
The girl’s knowing glance and her slightly gossipy tone followed.
“Ah, did your boyfriend cover you with it to keep you cozy?”
With admiration in her voice, she added, “He must really care for you! Does wearing his jacket make your heart feel warm?” Sadie felt a sting from the girl’s words.
Warm? Perhaps it once was.
Now, all that remained was a cold and sharp ache.
If Noah truly cared, why would he leave her for Kyla?
Sadie tried to respond, meeting the girl’s expectant look, but she found herself torn between a lie and a truth too painful to utter.
Fortunately, the subway pulled into the station, and Sadie seized the moment to escape.
Inside the Night Owl Bar, the clash of loud music and vibrant lights overwhelmed the senses.
As she navigated through the crowded space, the mix of perfume and alcohol in the air unsettled her.
Upon reaching Room 317, Sadie paused, inhaling deeply to steady her nerves.

###Chapter 60:
The door burst open just as she raised her hand to knock.
A disheveled woman was forcefully ejected, landing on the floor with a painful groan.
From inside, a man’s harsh, rough voice reached Sadie’s ears. “If you can’t handle the game, stay out of it. You’re just spoiling my fun!” A slight tension gripped Sadie’s frame as she pieced together the scene inside.
A wave of fear washed over her.
She was about to turn away when the man caught sight of her. “Hey there, pretty lady. First time here?” he inquired, eyeing her with evident predatory interest.
With quick thinking, Sadie said, “I’m sorry, I’m just passing by.”
The man’s gaze narrowed suspiciously on her. When he noticed the suit jacket she wore, his expression momentarily stilled.
The jacket, dark and meticulously tailored, clearly spoke of wealth.
Her appearance in a man’s jacket suggested she wasn’t alone. And the quality of the jacket implied its owner was influential and not to be trifled with.
The man was here for fun, not for trouble.
Yet, the allure of Sadie’s beauty made it hard for him to dismiss her. Finally, he shoved down his frustration and gave the woman on the floor a kick, muttering, “What a killjoy!” He then forcefully shut the door.
Breathing a sigh of relief, Sadie knelt to assist the weeping woman, gently asking, “Are you okay?”
Tears streaming, the woman said, “They’re just dreadful…”
As Sadie soothed her, she simultaneously gathered useful information.
“They… they made me do things…” The woman’s voice trembled, each word a broken shard of terror.
Read the newest chapters g?lnσνs?c?m
Sadie listened patiently, slowly reconstructing the chaos of events. Inside the private room, a man in his forties reigned supreme, a center of gravity around which every sycophant swirled. Drink-sellers were coerced by these sycophants into performing provocative acts, yet the man in the center didn’t seem interested.
“He didn’t even look at me…” The woman sobbed, her anguish deepening. “They told me I was worthless… then discarded me like refuse.”
In that moment, Sadie was convinced Roy was a man of principles. If she could avoid the sycophants surrounding him and speak to him directly, she’d face far less peril.
Exiting the Night Owl Bar, Sadie lingered at the entrance, her eyes scanning every departing silhouette, determined not to miss sight of Roy. The cool night wind whispered over her exposed skin, teasing stray hairs on her forehead. Even in the murk of night, Sadie’s beauty shone unmistakably—a silent magnet drawing attention from every corner.
A man with glossy hair and an ostentatious flair stepped forward and flirtatiously said, “My dear, would you care to join me for a drink inside? Just name your price.”
Sadie merely shook her head, her voice cool and unyielding. “I’m afraid I must decline—I’m awaiting someone.”
The man’s expression darkened as he snapped, “Why do you have to play hard to get?”
When he lunged forward, attempting to seize Sadie and pull her into the bar, her alarm surged. In a burst of defiance, she declared, “This is a public place; stop making a scene!”
A harsh laugh escaped the man as he sneered. “You parade your allure openly—why act so righteous? Attend to me, and your rewards shall be generous.”noveldrama
Undeterred, he reached out once more, his eyes glinting with greed and desire. But Sadie fought back fiercely—a resounding slap crashing into his leering face.
The man staggered, his shock quickly turning to rage as he shouted, “Damn, you bitch—how dare you hit me?”
Enraged, he roughly grabbed Sadie’s neck, pinning her hard against a nearby car. A crushing wave of suffocation hit her; she struggled for breath as her vision began to blur.

###Chapter 61:
Then, one of the man’s companions, looking terrified, warned him, “Mr. Natt, that suit she’s wearing looks custom-made. Only Noah Wall would have one like that. Could she… could she be with him?” Jorma Natt paused, his grip loosening ever so slightly.
Grasping the fleeting opportunity, Sadie managed to stammer, “I… I’m Noah’s wife… just let me go…”
Jorma snorted with disbelief, his eyes laced with sarcasm. “Wife? Since when did Noah ever get married? How come I didn’t know? Noah’s true love is back—and the only person he’s going to marry is Kyla. Who do you think you are, pretending to be his wife?”
With that, he yanked the suit jacket off Sadie and threw it aside with disdain. “You’re not talking your way out of this!” The jacket fell onto the dirty ground.
The faint trace of Noah’s cologne stood in stark contrast to the grimy air.
Sadie knew, deep within her, that there was no escape from this moment.
Jorma grabbed a fistful of her hair and pulled her toward the Night Owl Bar with ruthless force.
Despair haunted Sadie’s eyes. Her attempts to resist and her cries proved futile. The sounds of the bar seemed to filter through from another dimension.
In secrecy, Jorma’s companion snapped a photo of the suit on the ground and messaged Samuel, saying, “Is this Noah’s suit? A woman claiming to be his wife was just taken into the Night Owl Bar by Jorma.” Plans began to form in the man’s mind.
Whether or not this woman was connected to Noah, it presented an opportunity for him to demonstrate his loyalty and get closer.
Samuel quickly forwarded the message to Noah.
A heavy scent of perfume filled the dimly lit room. Sadie found herself harshly tied to a bed adorned with romantic motifs, her wrists and ankles bound so tightly that they caused her pain. Despite her struggles, she was immobilized.

“Do you prefer it rough or gentle?” Jorma sneered, retrieving several whips from a tool cabinet and approaching her.
Tears of anger welled in Sadie’s eyes as she glared back at him. “You’re a monster! Release me now!” she shouted.
If her glare could inflict harm, Jorma would have been in pieces.
Jorma’s smile only grew more sinister. “You’ve got spirit; that’s what I like to see,” he replied casually, pinning her down on the bed.
The silence was broken by the faint sound of fabric rustling.noveldrama
“No!” Sadie’s shout was a mix of panic and despair.
Her instinct was to fight, to push back, but she felt utterly powerless. Jorma relished her vulnerability, delighting in it like a predator with its captured prey.
Bending over, he tried to plant a kiss on Sadie’s neck.
In that instant, Sadie found a sliver of opportunity. Gathering all her strength, she bit hard into Jorma’s ear.
“Ah!” Jorma howled in pain, his hands flying to his ear as blood spilled between his fingers. He touched his ear, only to discover a piece was missing.
Driven by searing pain, his rage escalated. “You bitch! You’re going to die today!” he yelled, grabbing a whip and striking Sadie brutally.
The lash struck Sadie, and a sharp cry escaped her as pain flared through her. With relentless force, the whip continued its assault, each strike etching a line of agony into her skin.
As the torture persisted, Sadie’s mind clouded with pain, reducing her responses to mere survival. Initially, she could still cry out, but her cries soon diminished to weak whimpers.
Overwhelmed by the continuous pain, Sadie gradually lost consciousness. A soft moan escaped her as her eyelids fluttered weakly.

###Chapter 62:
Through the haze, a vague shape began to emerge in her blurred vision. A sense of being rescued flickered through her mind, anchoring her fading awareness. She silently vowed to forever be grateful to this savior.
As Sadie regained consciousness, the pungent scent of disinfectant filled her nostrils. She opened her eyes to find herself in a hospital room, the walls adorned with green and white stripes.
Noah was seated beside the bed, his forehead creased with weariness.
Was it him?
Her heart raced, hope flickering in her eyes.
Feeling her stare, Noah looked her way and gently said, “You’re awake.”
Oddly, his words enveloped Sadie with a comforting warmth. She gave a small nod, hesitating to voice her questions.
At that moment, Kyla entered, bearing a container of food, her expression warm. “Here’s some soup for you, Noah. You must be starving,” she said, passing the container to Noah with a familiarity that spoke of closeness.
As Kyla turned to Sadie, her voice held a comforting tone. “Don’t worry, Sadie. The police caught that man yesterday. What would you like to eat? I can bring it for you.”
Her words were soft, soothing like a gentle breeze, yet they caused Sadie’s spirits to plummet.
It was the police who had rescued her, not Noah.
The spark in her eyes dimmed, replaced by a growing bitterness.
How could Noah have been her rescuer?
While she had endured her ordeal, he was likely with Kyla.
G aln ove ls . com has stories you’ll lovenoveldrama
“Thanks, but I don’t feel like eating,” Sadie murmured.
At her words, Kyla’s eyes filled with tears, her expression teetering on the edge of breaking down.
“I’m sorry for intruding and causing you distress. This is all my fault,” she murmured, her lip quivering and her shoulders shaking, as though she had been deeply wronged.
Sadie watched her, the feigned vulnerability from Kyla unsettling the peace in her heart.
She found herself at a loss for words, sensing that whatever she might say would be inconsequential.
Suddenly, the silence of the room was broken by the health monitor beside the bed, which started beeping sharply.
Jim entered swiftly, a look of concern etched on his face.
“The patient needs to be undisturbed for her rest,” he said firmly.
A flicker of irritation crossed Jim’s face as he glanced pointedly at Kyla.
Caught in her act of exaggerated frailty, Kyla seemed uncomfortable. She hadn’t anticipated her actions would lead to accusations of disturbing Sadie.
Her eyes welled up again as she looked to Noah for support, biting her lip in apparent distress.
Noah remained focused on Sadie, ignoring Kyla’s emotional display, as he asked Jim, “Have the test results come in yet? What’s the status of Sadie’s health?”
Sadie felt a pang of despair at his words.
Tightly gripping the quilt, she attempted to sit up, her movements laced with anxiety. “Dr. Archer…”
She harbored a secret she didn’t want Noah to discover—her pregnancy. Jim glanced at Noah and then at Kyla, allowing a heavy silence to settle before he said, “Her life isn’t in danger. She needs to focus on resting.”
Noah’s expression darkened with concern, his voice tinged with skepticism. “She’s been experiencing nausea and fainting. Are you sure she’s fine?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 63:
Jim met Sadie’s anxious gaze, took a deliberate breath, and affirmed with certainty, “She’s alright, just overly fatigued and in need of rest.”
Noah’s frown deepened. He sensed something was off in Jim’s assessment but respected his medical expertise.
The room fell into a tense silence.
Sadie felt a slight burden lift from her shoulders. She exhaled wearily and murmured, “Please, everyone, leave. I need to rest.”
Noah hesitated, words on the tip of his tongue, but he restrained himself, recalling Jim’s earlier advice. He rose, his presence looming over Sadie, and whispered reassuringly, “Rest now. Don’t worry about anything. The man from last night won’t bother you again; he’s been arrested.”
Sadie was momentarily stunned, a mix of emotions flickering in her weary eyes.
For a fleeting moment, she nearly convinced herself that Noah had rescued her, yet Kyla’s earlier remarks echoed in her mind—the police were the true rescuers, not Noah.
As Noah exited, Kyla trailed behind him. The echoing click of Kyla’s heels on the floor slowly receded, and with them, the fleeting comfort brought by Noah’s seemingly concerned words dissipated from Sadie’s heart.
She then looked toward Jim, who had purposely stayed behind, and summoned her strength, calling out, “Dr. Archer…” Her voice was raspy. “Thank you.”
Jim paused and turned, caught off guard. “For what?”
“For keeping the baby a secret from Noah.” Her grip on the quilt intensified, whitening her knuckles.
Jim wore a look that conveyed mixed emotions. He paused, weighing his words, then asked, “Sooner or later, the truth will surface. What’s your next move?”
Sadie’s eyes lingered on the pristine white of her quilt. A resolve solidified within her as she said, “I will divorce Noah as soon as possible. And this child? I’m raising them by myself.”

Jim, visibly startled, struggled to grasp her resolution. “You… you’re planning to raise the baby on your own?” he asked, stunned. “That won’t be easy.”
Beneath the quilt, Sadie caressed her abdomen, feeling the stir of new life. A small, yet resolute smile formed on her lips. “Each child is a blessing,” she said softly, her voice resonant with determination. “This child picked me to be their mother, and I will shoulder that responsibility. They may not have a father, but I will make sure they feel double the love from me.”
After a brief silence, Jim nodded, accepting her choice. “Okay, if you’re sure that’s what you want.”
Sadie nodded in return, a small smile of gratitude forming on her face.
Jim exited the hospital room quietly, softly clicking the door shut. He pondered whether Noah would one day regret losing such a remarkable woman. Unlikely.
Recalling Noah’s lack of empathy, Jim shook his head in disappointment and sighed softly. He pulled out a prescription pad and wrote down the names of some medications. On the surface, they appeared to be simple vitamins to help Sadie recover, but in reality, they were meant to protect her pregnancy.
Later that day, as Sadie sat in the hospital canteen, her phone rang with an unexpected call from a nurse.
“Miss Hudson, your grandmother is now awake.”
At the news, Sadie felt a surge of happiness replace her grief instantly. “Is that true? I’m on my way!”noveldrama
She rushed toward Laura’s hospital room.
A clinical scent lingered in the air, and the stark white linens contrasted sharply with Laura’s pale complexion. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 64:
As Sadie gripped Laura’s delicate hand, her tears began to flow.
“Grandma, it’s such a relief to see your eyes open! I was terrified when you collapsed. What caused your heart attack?” Sadie’s voice trembled with emotion.
Laura had always been healthy, with no history of heart issues, making the attack even more baffling to Sadie.
With her other hand, Laura reached out to brush away Sadie’s tears. Her own eyes brimmed with tears, too.
“Sadie, have you been keeping secrets from me?” Laura whispered weakly.
Frozen by the question, Sadie responded, “What?”
Laura’s eyes searched Sadie’s, filled with deep concern.
“Have you been involved with another woman’s man?” Laura’s words were heavy with grief, and her tears flowed freely. “It’s my fault. I failed to keep you safe.”
Confusion clouded Sadie’s expression, and her anxiety mounted. “Grandma, why would you think that? Who has been filling your head with such lies?” Sadie’s voice rose in frustration.
Laura continued, “Someone delivered photos and a letter to my doorstep. They showed you being held by a man as you entered his car.”
Sadie gasped.
A man was holding her? Entering a car?
“And the letter accused you of stealing this woman’s husband,” Laura said with effort, each word seeming to drain her strength. “It warned that you must end it, or suffer the consequences.”
A chill crept down Sadie’s spine, leaving her momentarily speechless as she scrambled for the right words.
Laura’s eyes locked onto Sadie’s forehead, and her face paled with horror. “You’re injured? Did that person come after you to settle the score?”
Exclusive updates available at g?lnσνe?s?c?mnoveldrama
Her voice quivered, thick with fear and panic. “Sweetheart, listen—stay out of someone else’s marriage. You need to cut ties with that man immediately.”
With each word, Laura’s anxiety swelled, her breaths growing ragged as her chest rose and fell in frantic waves.
Sadie felt as though an invisible fist had clenched around her heart, squeezing until it became hard to breathe.
“Grandma, it’s not like that,” she said, her voice shaky despite her best efforts to steady it.
But Laura’s doubtful gaze didn’t waver, and Sadie exhaled deeply, the weight of misunderstanding pressing down on her. “Where are the photos?” she asked softly.
Laura pointed towards her clothes. “In my pocket.”
After she left the resuscitation room, a nurse had swapped her clothes for a sterile patient gown. The nurse had then placed her belongings in this ward.
Sadie stepped over to the clothes, her hands fumbling through the fabric until her fingertips brushed against something stiff and glossy.
She pulled out the photos.
There, frozen in glossy stillness, were images of her and Noah.
His arm was wrapped around her waist, shielding her in a way that felt far too intimate. The closeness between them was undeniable, almost tender.
Sadie’s breath caught in her throat.
She couldn’t even recall a moment when she’d been that close to Noah.
A bitter knot twisted in her chest, rising like bile.
How was she supposed to explain this to Laura?
If she confessed the truth—that the man in the photos was her husband—then when the inevitable divorce happened, it would only make the situation worse. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 65:
But lying wasn’t any easier.
Sadie clutched the photos tighter, her mind racing for an answer.
After a shaky inhale, she forced a smile and walked back to Laura. “The man in the photos is my boss, Noah Wall,” she said, trying to sound casual. “He’s still single.”
Every word that slipped from Sadie’s lips was the truth.
Her marriage to Noah was a well-kept secret, buried so deeply that no online search could unearth their marital records.
But Laura’s skeptical gaze lingered, her clouded eyes narrowing with concern. “I hope you’re not lying to me.”
Without missing a beat, Sadie pulled out her phone and began typing, searching for proof right then and there.
The loading icon spun in circles before the results popped up. Noah’s public profile stared back at them, his marital status boldly stamped: Single.
Sadie shrugged, forcing an easy tone. “See? There’s no truth to that rumor about me interfering in someone else’s marriage.”
Laura’s frown deepened, her thoughts clearly racing. “So someone’s out to smear your name.”
Sadie gave a tight nod, a sharp glint flickering in her eyes. “You said there was a letter with the photos? Did you keep it? Maybe we can trace the handwriting and figure out who’s behind this.”
Laura froze for a moment, then let out a frustrated sigh and patted her head. “I tore up the letter and tossed it in the trash.”
Sadie reached for Laura’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. “It’s okay. No one else has been home, right? The letter should still be there. I’ll head back later and dig it out.”
They talked for a little while longer, with Sadie making sure Laura’s nerves had settled before finally getting up to leave.

But as she approached the door, she nearly collided with a slender figure—Kyla.
Sadie hadn’t planned on giving Kyla a second glance, but Kyla’s panicked, guilty expression made her stop in her tracks. “What are you doing here?”
Kyla’s eyes darted away, her words tumbling out in a stammer. “Well, um… my… my heart’s been acting up. I came for a check-up.”
Then, as if a switch had flipped, Kyla’s tone turned defensive, her eyes narrowing. “But what’s it to you, anyway?”
Kyla turned around and stormed off, her footsteps echoing hastily down the corridor.
Sadie stood there, watching her retreat, her brows knitting together as a profound unease settled heavily in her chest.
There was something about Kyla’s panicked gaze and her fumbled, half-hearted excuse that felt like sharp thorns digging into Sadie’s thoughts.
Determined, Sadie sought out Jim to arrange her discharge, eager to rush to Laura’s apartment and find that letter.
However, Jim firmly ed. “You’re pregnant, and you were really shaken up yesterday. It’s crucial that you rest to maintain your pregnancy’s stability. Wandering about is the last thing you should be doing now.”
But Sadie was resolute. “There’s something pressing that I need to attend to immediately. As for the baby, I have a strong feeling—they’re just fine.”
Despite his reservations, Jim could not sway her; eventually, he gave in.
On her way out of Jim’s office, Sadie unexpectedly encountered Kyla again.
Their paths crossing so frequently seemed almost orchestrated.
Had she not known of Kyla’s heart condition and her urgent need for medical attention, Sadie might have suspected Kyla of snooping on her conversations.

###Chapter 66:
With her patience wearing thin, Sadie brushed past Kyla, barely acknowledging her presence.
“Sadie!” Kyla’s voice, laced with urgency and a tremor of panic, halted her.
Sadie stopped dead in her tracks but didn’t turn to face Kyla.
“Y—you’re pregnant?” Kyla stammered, her voice a mix of disbelief and fear.
At that moment, a cold dread washed over Sadie, her heart plunging into an abyss of worry.
Under Kyla’s icy glare, a shiver skittered down Sadie’s spine, her posture rigid with unease.
“What does that have to do with you?” she demanded, her voice edged with defensiveness.
Sadie instinctively wrapped her arms around her stomach, a protective gesture that didn’t go unnoticed.
“Then why haven’t you told Noah you’re pregnant?” Kyla snapped, her fingers clamping around Sadie’s wrist with a force that bordered on painful, her nails threatening to break skin.
“Let me guess—you’re going to have the baby behind his back and then shove them in his face to blackmail him?” she went on, pure contempt lacing her words.
The sharp pinch forced a grimace onto Sadie’s face as she wrenched her arm free, her scorn palpable. “Do you think I’m as desperate as you? Clinging to Noah by any deceitful means necessary?” Sadie retorted, her disdain for Kyla’s touch evident in her shudder of revulsion.
Kyla, momentarily unbalanced by the force, steadied herself and sneered. “Pathetic. You actually believe having his child will keep Noah by your side? If he couldn’t care less about you now, what makes you think he’ll give a damn about that baby?”
She paused, her voice dropping colder with each word. “If you’re hoping this baby will boost your standing, you’re living in a fantasy. A man of Noah’s caliber could father countless heirs if he chose.” With a mocking laugh, Sadie shot back, “Then I sincerely wish you luck in bearing Noah’s child soon!”
With a final, dismissive glance at Kyla, Sadie turned around and strode away.
  ? .
All she wanted now was to get that letter and put an end to this nightmare once and for all.
Kyla watched, her chest burning with pure rage as Sadie’s silhouette faded into the distance.
The sting of Sadie’s parting words lingered, as sharp and sudden as a slap across her face.
Noah hadn’t even laid a damn finger on her—not even once! What would happen if Noah found out that Sadie was carrying his child?
The mere possibility made her shiver, her mind refusing to accept the outcome.
Despite trying to convince herself otherwise, Kyla knew in her heart that Noah harbored feelings for Sadie.
His fleeting looks and subtle, unconscious gestures were undeniable—silent testaments to his care.
No, this child had no place in this world—they had to be dealt with. Kyla’s resolve hardened, and she sprinted after Sadie, her decision crystallizing with every step.
She scanned her surroundings in panic, only to catch a glimpse of a self-driving car pulling away from the curb.
Sadie’s voice, distant and icy, floated back to her. “Take me to Everhart Gardens.”
Everhart Gardens. Of course. That was where Laura, Sadie’s grandmother, resided.
A memory flashed in Kyla’s mind: the hushed tones of a conversation she had overheard between Sadie and Laura.

###Chapter 67:
The letter. That damning, handwritten letter.
If Noah ever laid eyes on it and recognized her handwriting, the fallout would be catastrophic.
A sharp pang gripped Kyla’s chest, a cold wave creeping up from her toes to the crown of her head.
Her gaze locked onto the self-driving car vanishing into the distance. Without hesitation, she scribbled down its plate number.
She slipped into a quiet corner, pulled out her phone, and dialed. The call connected instantly. A laid-back male voice came through the line. “Well, well, it’s been a while. Miss me? Let me guess—another hotel? I promise, you won’t regret it.”
Kyla’s fingers tightened around the phone, her tone sharp. “I need to discuss something important with you.”
“Oh? And what pressing issue made you reach out first?” the man teased.
“Can you hijack a self-driving car and make it crash?” Kyla asked without preamble.
A brief silence followed, then a soft chuckle. “Naturally. Have you forgotten who you’re talking to? But… my skills don’t come cheap.”
Kyla inhaled deeply. “Two hundred grand.”
“For that price, I can guarantee minor injuries, but nothing fatal,” the man countered smoothly.
Kyla realized she was being taken advantage of.
Her jaw clenched. “What do you want?”
“Simple. A night with you.”
  ? .
Kyla didn’t respond immediately. She already knew this was coming.
After a brief pause, her voice turned cold. “Fine. But not tonight. I have something important today.”
“Deal.” The man agreed without hesitation. “Just don’t think about backing out, or I might feel inclined to expose your secrets.”
Kyla gave an indifferent “understood” and sent over Sadie’s license plate.
Keystrokes echoed faintly over the call.
Moments later, he spoke. “In ten minutes, that car will collide with another self-driving car at a traffic light. The probability of fatality? Around eighty percent.”
A slow, pleased smile spread across Kyla’s lips. “Perfect.” She ended the call and immediately swallowed a pill.
The pill was designed to strain her heart—mimicking a severe cardiac episode that would fool any medical scan.
She had kept it as a safeguard, anticipating the day Noah might suspect her illness was a facade.
Now, it was time to make the act real—to ensure Noah stayed by her side instead of running to Sadie’s rescue.noveldrama
The drug worked fast. Pressure built in her chest, her breaths turning labored.
Supporting herself against the wall, she staggered toward the hospital.
The busy outpatient hall blurred before her eyes.
A final inhale—then she crumpled to the floor.
“Someone collapsed!”
“Nurse!”
“She’s not breathing!”
“Blood pressure’s plummeting!”
“Her heart’s out of rhythm!”
“Increase the dosage, now!” Inside the oxygen chamber, alarms shrieked as medical personnel scrambled to stabilize Kyla. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 68:
Kyla’s face was ghostly pale, her brows knitted, her lips trembling as if she were on the verge of death.
Noah arrived in a rush the moment he received word.
He stormed into the oxygen room, the sharp scent of antiseptic hitting him immediately.
His eyes found Kyla on the hospital bed—barely hanging on.
A doctor turned to him. “Mr. Wall, Miss Wade’s condition is critical. We’re doing everything possible.”
A nurse spoke to Noah, “Are you a relative? Hold her hands—she might remove the oxygen mask.” Noah’s gaze fell on Kyla.
Inside the mask, condensation had gathered, making each breath a struggle. She fought to stay conscious.
Noah moved quickly, following the nurse’s commands. His strong, slender hands pressed firmly on Kyla’s, ensuring she remained still. Kyla’s voice was a fragile murmur. “Noah… I feel terrible…”
Noah’s brow furrowed in immediate concern. “Kyla, stay with me. The doctors will take care of you.”
Kyla’s fingers twitched as she weakly attempted to hold his hands, but Noah intentionally pulled away. Instead, he pressed her wrists down firmly, making sure she didn’t remove her oxygen mask.
His focus was absolute; his eyes locked on Kyla with an intensity that made everything else in the room seem distant and irrelevant. It was as if the world had narrowed down to just the two of them.
Despite the pain, Kyla felt a twisted satisfaction deep inside. As long as she kept Noah occupied, Sadie wouldn’t get the help she needed. She would die.noveldrama
Meanwhile, Sadie sat in the self-driving car, unease gnawing at her. Something didn’t feel right. Was it just a coincidence that she ran into Kyla twice at the hospital? And who had sent her grandma those photos and the letter? Who could know so much about her life, her family? It had to be… Kyla, right?

Before Sadie could process the thought, a car ran a red light and slammed into the side of her vehicle with a deafening bang!
Everything flipped; Sadie was thrown around like a rag doll, her body violently jolted with every impact.
Panic surged through her as she instinctively wrapped her arms protectively around her abdomen.
Her head hit the window hard, sending a jolt of searing pain through her skull. Blood streamed down her forehead, and her vision blurred as she struggled to focus.
Through the pain, Sadie noticed flames licking at the car’s exterior, getting dangerously close.
Fear gripped her heart, freezing her in place. Her breath caught, shallow and quick. The seatbelt and airbag had trapped her, and the door was pinned to the ground.
Sadie’s fingers twitched, the only part of her body still free. She could feel the warmth of the fire creeping closer, and a cold realization hit her: if she didn’t escape, the flames would consume both her and the baby.
“Help…” Sadie’s voice was barely audible, a faint whisper against the overwhelming roar of the flames.
Each breath felt like she was inhaling fire itself, the smoke stinging her lungs and clouding her thoughts. Her body felt numb, but she forced her trembling fingers to find her phone. The screen was smeared with her blood, a cruel reminder of the danger she was in. Desperation surged through her as she pressed the power button three times with frantic urgency.
The phone dialed Noah, her emergency contact. She had set this up long ago, believing he would always be there when she needed him most. 
.

.
###Chapter 69:
Now, in this burning wreck, he was her only hope.
Each ring seemed to drag on forever, the silence more deafening than the flames. The car was slowly being consumed by fire, and the smoke was choking her. Time was running out.
Sadie dialed again, panic clawing at her chest. Every ring felt like a knife twisting in her heart. Her pulse raced, her thoughts frantic. Please, just pick up.
Then, at last, the call connected.
“Are you serious? Can’t you leave me alone?” Noah’s cold and impatient voice snapped through.
Before Sadie could speak, Noah continued, his tone clipped, “Kyla’s in critical condition. I don’t have time for this. If you have something to say, then wait.”
“I’m dying, Noah…” Sadie’s voice was barely a whisper, weak and strained. “For everything we were, please, save me…”
The smoke filled Sadie’s lungs, a burning ache that made her vision swim and everything around her fade into a blur. She held the phone tightly, clinging to it as if it were her last thread of hope.
Noah’s brow furrowed as he heard the desperation in Sadie’s voice. “What’s happening, Sadie?”
Sadie’s words sounded hollow and distant, and Noah felt a flicker of concern. But before he could press further, Kyla suddenly gasped, coughing violently, and she tried to tear the oxygen mask off her face.
“Kyla!” Noah’s voice rang out, his tone full of urgency. He quickly grabbed her hands and tried to soothe her. “It’s okay. I’m here. Just breathe.”
Noah turned his head toward his phone, his voice taking on a sharp, frosty edge. “Kyla can’t be left alone. Sadie, enough with these childish games.”
The word “childish” echoed, tightening an invisible grip around Sadie’s heart, the pain almost suffocating her. Words failed her as she struggled to respond.

Then, with a harsh beep, the line went dead. The relentless busy signal hammered in Sadie’s ears, each tone driving deeper into her dwindling hope.
Her gaze dropped. She was utterly crushed, her phone slipping through her trembling fingers. Even if she were gasping for her last breath, she would never hold a place in Noah’s heart like Kyla did.
How the hell could he be this cruel? After all these years, it dawned on Sadie that her love had been tragically misplaced.
As her consciousness began to fade, a silhouette darted through the encroaching flames toward her.
“Sadie!” The voice, urgent and laden with profound concern, pierced the chaos.noveldrama
Sadie’s eyes fluttered shut.
When she regained consciousness, she found herself lying in a hospital bed. Opening her eyes, Sadie was greeted by the stark, blinding whiteness of the ceiling above, the acrid scent of disinfectant assaulting her nostrils.
She attempted to shift her position, but a sharp sting from her injuries made her grimace painfully.
“Stay still. You’re hooked up to an IV.” A stiff, uneasy voice broke the silence beside her.
Turning toward the source, Sadie saw Alex. Strands of his hair were burnt at the tips, his face was smudged with grime, and the collar of his shirt was charred.
There was no doubt—he had walked through hell itself for her. A rush of warmth flooded Sadie’s heart at the realization.
“You came for me, didn’t you?” she asked, her voice laden with certainty.
Catching a flicker of disappointment in her eyes, Alex nodded, his voice soft. “Yes, I did.”

###Chapter 70:
He paused, as if he had more to say. “Noah must be caught up in something urgent; don’t think too much about it.”
“You don’t need to cover for him,” Sadie said, a gentle shake of her head dismissing his excuse as she let her eyes drift closed once more.
She had reached out to Noah, yet at her most desperate hour, he had chosen Kyla. The pain of that realization was sharper than any physical wound.
A moment of panic touched her features as she gingerly felt her abdomen. “Thank you for saving me,” she murmured, anxiety threading through her voice. “Is my baby…?”
The thought of harm coming to her child was unbearable, the weight of potential guilt as a mother heavy on her soul.
Alex leaned in, his eyes alight with concern as he gently reassured her. “Your baby isn’t seriously injured, thankfully, but your pregnancy is somewhat precarious right now. You’re on medication to help stabilize things. The doctor mentioned that a few days of bed rest should set things right.”
Sadie exhaled, her shoulders dropping as the weight of her worry lifted slightly.
The baby was safe—that was all that mattered.
As she opened her mouth to express her gratitude, the abrupt ring of Alex’s phone cut her off.
He answered swiftly, his face contorting with concern, his eyebrows knitting together in a mix of confusion and frustration as the conversation unfolded.
Feeling a knot form in her stomach, Sadie watched him closely, sensing the gravity of the call.
“What happened?” she questioned, unable to contain her anxiety.
After ending the call, Alex faced her, his voice thick with unease. “It appears there’s more to the crash than bad luck. The self-driving car that hit you—it showed clear signs of external tampering. Someone hacked its system, causing it to veer off course at the intersection and collide with your car.”

He paused, letting the words sink in, his gaze intensifying as he studied Sadie’s reaction. “It seems like this wasn’t just an accident, Sadie. It was orchestrated.”
“Orchestrated?” Sadie repeated, her voice barely above a whisper as a cold shiver raced down her spine.noveldrama
First, the unnerving incident with Laura—so close to being catastrophic—and now this. Someone was clearly after her. But the haunting question remained.
Who the hell would go this far just to hurt her?
Fear gripped Sadie’s heart, her entire being encased in its icy hold. “Who is the hacker? Have you found out yet?” Her voice quivered, barely masking the panic beneath it.
Alex exhaled heavily, the weight of the situation clear in his drooping shoulders. “We’re still digging, Sadie, but it’s like chasing shadows. Nothing solid yet.” He rubbed the bridge of his nose in frustration.
A heavy silence filled the hospital room.
Sadie’s restless fingers wandered to her belly, tracing the faint, reassuring pulse of the tiny heart within. The reality of her pregnancy—her fragile secret—made her all the more anxious.
It had been a miracle that both she and the baby had emerged unscathed from the harrowing car crash. With the stakes higher than ever, she resolved to keep her pregnancy a secret, fearing it could be used as leverage against her.
Turning her earnest, worried eyes toward Alex, she made a bold request. “Alex, could you do something for me? Can you change my medical records to show that I had a miscarriage?” Her gaze was resolute, a stark contrast to the fragility of her condition.
Alex paused, considering the gravity of her words, then nodded slowly. “I’ll take care of it, don’t worry,” he assured her, his voice firm.
He rose, his tall frame slicing through the lingering tension as he exited.

###Chapter 71:
Moments later, the door creaked open again.
Kyla stepped inside, her presence like a gentle breeze, carrying a basket brimming with fresh fruit. A smile, tinged with concern, played on her lips.
“Is it done?” Sadie murmured, her eyes still closed against the dull throb in her temples, mistaking Kyla for Alex.
“Done what?” Kyla’s voice floated softly, tinged with confusion.
Sadie’s eyes flew open to find Kyla standing beside her bed, her expression unsettlingly sweet as she held a fruit basket.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Sadie’s voice was frosty, her brow furrowing in suspicion.
Unperturbed, Kyla perched on the edge of the mattress, gently setting the basket on the nearby table.
“I came to see you,” she replied, her tone dripping with feigned concern, which only deepened Sadie’s unease.
Sadie hadn’t mentioned her car accident to anyone. How on earth had Kyla found out?
Her fingers twitched beneath the quilt, curling into a fist.
Could Kyla have orchestrated this crash?
Kyla’s light, eerie laugh cut through the tension. “When you called Noah for help, guess what? I was right there with him. He was too busy taking care of me to talk to you.” The realization hit Sadie like a cold wave.
Kyla had been with Noah when she had desperately called him for help.
A shiver of fear trickled down Sadie’s spine as the implications of Kyla’s words chilled her to the core.
In her darkest hour, when she needed help most, Noah had turned his back on her—all for Kyla.
L?tst chαpt?rs in lnovels.
The bitter truth gnawed at her as Sadie found herself glancing at the hospital room door, foolishly wishing Noah would come.
“Don’t waste your time looking,” Kyla remarked, her voice tinged with a mirthless chuckle. She casually draped a hand over her mouth, her smirk evident. “Noah had to rush back to his company for some urgent business.”
The words stabbed at Sadie’s heart, spreading a cold, numbing pain throughout her body.
Yet, beneath her composed exterior, Kyla was far from the triumphant figure she portrayed.
The moment her condition stabilized, Noah had rushed back to his responsibilities, not sparing another moment by her side.
Why? Why did Noah’s indifference cut so deeply?
As Kyla mulled over his cold detachment, a tide of disappointment and bitterness threatened to overwhelm her. But she couldn’t let Sadie see her weakness.
Maintaining her composed fa?ade, Kyla arched an eyebrow and spoke with forced nonchalance. “You know, I told Noah about your pregnancy, urging him to come to your side. But he refused. He chose to stay with me.”
She picked up an apple, her knife gliding smoothly as she began to peel it, her gaze fixed intently on Sadie’s ashen face.
“You see, Sadie, in his eyes, you and your child don’t weigh as much as I do.”
Her tone was soft, almost tender, but each word sliced through the air, sharp and merciless.
As Sadie observed Kyla’s smug grin, a shiver of dread crept across her heart.noveldrama
So, Noah was already aware that she was pregnant.
He had known all along and had heartlessly allowed her to perish in that tragic car accident. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 72:
She had once harbored the naive hope that Noah’s heart was just unreachable, that perhaps his love was something she could earn through persistence and sacrifice.
But now, the truth was painfully clear—his icy indifference and calculated cruelty were directed solely at her.
In contrast, his demeanor towards Kyla was tender and considerate; he was even willing to sacrifice her for Kyla’s happiness.
This realization shattered her last vestige of hope, like fragile glass swept away by relentless winds.
With a heavy sigh, Sadie closed her eyes, her eyelashes quivering as they veiled the despair welling up inside her.
Well, just let it be.
It was time to let go.
Her fingers, cold and trembling, tenderly brushed over her flat abdomen, connecting with the faint but determined heartbeat within—a tiny life striving to blossom against the odds.
“Sweetie,” she murmured with a gentle resolve. “Your father doesn’t want us, but we have each other. Together, we’ll make it through.”
As Sadie lifted her gaze once more, her eyes mirrored nothing but steely resolve.
“So what if he wasn’t there to save me? I survived, didn’t I? He’s not that important to me.”
Kyla’s expression transformed in an instant, her meticulously applied makeup failing to mask the predatory glint in her eyes.
Her carefully laid plans were unraveling before her.
Fixating on Sadie’s belly, hidden only by a thin quilt, Kyla seemed to be searching for a glimpse of her greatest fear coming to life beneath the fabric.

The air thickened with tension as Sadie caught the lethal intent flickering in Kyla’s gaze. Her defenses rose instinctively.
She could already tell—Kyla wasn’t going to back down that easily. Faking vulnerability, Sadie let her eyes droop sorrowfully as tears began to spill, tracing damp trails down her cheeks.
“But it was because of him that I lost the baby. His child is gone. Maybe this is his retribution,” she murmured, her voice a mix of grief and manipulation, cleverly leaving her words open to Kyla’s interpretation.
“The child… is gone?” Kyla’s voice cracked, a mix of disbelief and sudden elation coloring her tone as she shifted her focus back to Sadie, searching her face for confirmation.
Sadie offered no reply, allowing the silent tears to gather and fall, leaving moist traces on her nose.noveldrama
She portrayed the image of utter devastation.
As Kyla observed Sadie’s breakdown, a flicker of doubt shadowed her triumph.
Sadie had always presented a facade of toughness in her presence.
Since when had she become so visibly broken?
Yet Kyla quickly brushed aside the flicker of doubt.
Sadie—a pathetic fool. What kind of schemes could she even come up with?
She had Sadie figured out—dumb as a rock and twice as stubborn. Surely, if Sadie had been feigning weakness, she wouldn’t have been so thoroughly bested in the rivalry that simmered between them. With this realization, a weight seemed to lift from Kyla’s shoulders, a liberating exhale after holding her breath. What did it matter if Sadie survived?
The child was dead, and divorce loomed on the horizon like an inevitable dawn.
Suppressing a victorious grin, Kyla inhaled sharply, her joy bubbling just beneath the surface, yet her exterior remained a mask of concern. “Sadie, don’t take it too hard,” she murmured, her voice gentle as she wrapped her fingers around Sadie’s hand. “This loss doesn’t mean you won’t be a mother again.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 73:
Sadie responded only by pulling her hand away, her head turning as her shoulders trembled slightly.
“Rest well.” With a final glance at the pitiful figure on the bed, Kyla turned and left the room.
Her steps were quick and purposeful as she approached the nurse’s station, grabbing the arm of a young nurse with a sense of urgency that bordered on desperation. “Hello, I’m a friend of Sadie’s. Could you please tell me how her baby is?”
The nurse, after a brief glance at the medical records, confirmed the tragic news. “The patient had a miscarriage. The child is gone.”
At those words, Kyla felt the last bit of worry melt away, leaving her truly at ease.
Noah strode into his office.
Outside, beyond the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows, the urban sprawl pulsed with life, its bustling traffic flowing like a vibrant, ever-moving painting.
Yet, he spared no glance for the view. His forehead was creased in concentration, fingers tapping a restless rhythm on the smooth surface of the desk.
His heart thumped with a foreboding sense of dread, a silent alarm signaling that something dire loomed on the horizon.
“Damn it,” he muttered, yanking at his tie with a mix of irritation and restlessness.
Throughout the earlier meeting, his mind had been elsewhere. The memory of Sadie’s phone call haunted him—her voice frail and fraught with desperation, her words a tangled plea for help.
“Noah… help me…”
Back then, he had dismissed her with a curt hang-up, annoyed. Now, the echo of her fear gnawed at him, a relentless reminder that he might have overlooked something critical.
“Samuel!” he barked into the internal phone line, his voice laced with urgency.

“Yes, Mr. Wall?” Samuel’s prompt reply came.
“Check on Sadie. Find out what’s going on with her,” Noah commanded, his tone clipped and decisive.
“Perhaps it would be best if you reached out to her yourself, sir,” Samuel advised, his tone tinged with confusion.
Noah’s fist clenched tightly, his knuckles blanching. He brought it to his lips and coughed discreetly, a feeble attempt to mask his growing anxiety. His voice, sharp and clipped, broke through the strained silence. “Just go look into it!”
He slammed the phone down and began pacing his office, each step echoing his restlessness.
Calling Sadie now to show he cared? That was never going to happen! He had been dismissive, almost harsh, when he hung up on her. To reach out now would only wound his pride.
Deep down, Noah began to rationalize his hesitation.
Unbeknownst to him, his defenses were slowly crumbling; he had, though unwittingly, started to harbor genuine concern for the woman he had so casually brushed aside earlier.noveldrama
A soft, hesitant knock at the door pulled him from his reverie.
“Come in,” he called out, his tone more subdued than before.
Samuel entered, his posture rigid with formality as he stopped before the desk. “Mr. Wall, Mrs. Wall was in a car accident. She’s currently at the city hospital.”
“What?!” The word burst from Noah, his face draining of color as he leaped to his feet.
The news hit him like a physical blow.
Sadie’s desperate call for help replayed like a ghost in his mind, gripping him with a newfound panic. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 74:
“Is it serious?” His voice quavered despite his best efforts to remain composed.
Samuel’s eyes held a grave light as he responded, “Her injuries are quite severe. The doctors are still evaluating her condition.”
Restlessness took over—Noah grabbed his coat and hurried out of the office without a second thought.
“Get the car ready!” he bellowed, the command sharp in the quiet of the hallway, his mind a whirlwind of regret and confusion.
What the hell was he thinking, hanging up on her like that? Why had he been so cruel?
And if—God forbid—something were to happen to her, how would he ever forgive himself?
An unfamiliar fear, cold and suffocating, clenched around his heart. Samuel watched from the doorway as Noah disappeared down the hallway.
It was painfully clear to him that despite Noah’s own denials, he harbored deep feelings for Sadie. Yet, Noah was blind to his own heart, trapped in a stubborn lie he had crafted around himself. Samuel shook his head sadly.
If Sadie were to truly walk away, Noah’s regret would be immense. Behind the wheel, Noah drove with mechanical precision to the city hospital, his face set in a stoic, impenetrable mask.noveldrama
Yet, the sweat gathering on his palms as they gripped the steering wheel betrayed the chaos roiling inside him.
Meanwhile, in the hospital room, after Kyla had left, Sadie finally allowed the tears she had been holding back to fall.
She was shattered, unable to fathom how Noah could have become so callous, wishing death upon her and their unborn child.
“Sadie…” As Alex walked back in, a sharp pang clenched his heart at the sight of her misery.

He tenderly offered her a tissue, his touch gentle. “There’s more to life than this heartache. You’re not trapped by a single choice.”
Sadie’s head bowed low, and from her lips escaped a frail, whispery admission. “I don’t want him anymore. I just want this ache in my heart to fade away.”
Alex hesitated, his words catching in his throat. “Well…”
He trailed off, the weight of his thoughts manifesting in a heavy sigh. Slowly, he reached out, drawing Sadie into a tender embrace, his hand patting her back with a steady, comforting rhythm.
“Sadie, there’s no need to pretend you’re not hurting,” he murmured gently.
The warmth from his embrace seemed to dissolve the barriers Sadie had built around her emotions, and tears cascaded down her cheeks, each drop heavier than the last.
In that vulnerable moment, the door to the hospital room slammed open with a jarring bang.
“Sadie! How are you?” The urgency in Noah’s voice was palpable, his words laced with a tremor that betrayed his concern.
Caught in the midst of her tears, Sadie froze, her sobs suspended.
Noah’s tone shifted suddenly, the warmth seeping out to leave a chill. “What the hell are you doing?” he demanded, his eyes narrowing into a frosty glare as they swept across Alex’s comforting hold on Sadie, fixating on Alex’s arms encircling her.
That sight struck Noah like a thorn, his gaze stinging with betrayal and a burgeoning rage flaring within him.
Alex let Sadie go and turned to confront Noah.
Despite their history of close friendship, Alex’s anger was palpable, fueled by Noah’s absence when Sadie faced her darkest hours. “So you finally decided to show up?” Alex’s tone was icy, each word dripping with contempt and unspoken accusations.
With rage simmering in his eyes, Noah marched toward him, his steps like a predator closing in. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 75:
His formidable presence loomed over Alex, his eyes piercing with an unyielding intensity.
“Sadie is my wife,” he yelled, his voice a blend of command and raw emotion. “Keep your hands off her!”
Unfazed, Alex held his ground, his retort sharp and biting. “Is that your definition of a husband? Because last I checked, Sadie was—” He stopped short, his voice choked with a mix of sorrow and anger clouded Alex’s face. Regaining his composure, he said, “Listen, Noah, if you’re not going to look out for her, stay the hell out of her way. You don’t deserve her!”
Every word struck deep, making it harder for Noah to keep himself together. The anger building inside him erupted, shattering his once calm exterior.
With a roar, Noah threw a punch at Alex. “And you think you deserve her? Dream on, Alex. You really think you can take her from me? Go ahead and try—I’ll rip you apart!”
Jealousy and rage roiled within Noah, untamed and ferocious, threatening to consume him entirely.
Alex, taken aback, barely had time to brace himself before the punch landed. His head whipped to the side, and a thin line of blood traced down from the corner of his mouth.
Calmly, Alex wiped the blood away, his gaze steady and unflinching, a silent promise of retaliation gleaming in his eyes.
Sadie, her heart pounding with shock at the sudden violence, stepped in hurriedly. Her voice, though firm, trembled slightly as she said, “Noah, stop it right now!”
Noah, however, seemed unfazed by her plea. He turned to face her, his smile cold and mocking. “What? Scared for your lover?” he sneered.
“What bullshit are you even saying?” Sadie snapped back, disbelief filling her. She couldn’t believe the once-dignified man she knew could descend into such pettiness.
Seizing the moment, Alex grabbed Noah’s collar and pulled him close. “If you have a problem, take it up with me. Leave Sadie out of this,” he hissed, venom seeping through his clenched teeth. This only served to stoke the fires of Noah’s fury further.

The air between the two men crackled, charged with hostility, their stares locked in a ferocious battle of wills.
Amidst the escalating tension, Sadie felt a crushing wave of helplessness wash over her. Her voice, weary yet resolute, broke through the standoff. “I was in a car accident, and Alex saved my life. He’s my savior.”
Then, bitterness flared within her as she recalled Noah’s callous indifference during her time of crisis.
With a surge of emotion, her voice rose in volume, her words sharp with bitterness. “You can’t even appreciate what Alex did for me, and here you are, throwing punches as if you wish he hadn’t saved me! Noah, is that what you think? That I should have died instead?”
Sadie’s words were laced with an agonizing sorrow, each syllable cutting through Noah’s heart.
Noah stood motionless, stunned. His grip on reality seemed to loosen, just as his grip on Alex did. He let go, turning to face Sadie, emotions swirling in his eyes. He felt an urgent need to explain himself. “That’s not what I meant. The moment I heard about your accident, I—”
But Sadie sharply interrupted him, her voice thick with biting sarcasm. “So I should be grateful?”
Her eyes squeezed shut, as if trying to block out the painful memories that came rushing back. She recalled her desperate call for help during the car accident, amplifying the pain that still lingered.
Drawing a shaky breath, Sadie opened her eyes and fixed them on Noah, her voice quivering with a mix of grief and resentment. “Right after my accident, I reached out to you first. I begged for your help, for you to save me. And how did you respond?” Her words were like a cold gust, chilling the space between them. “You accused me of disturbing your precious time with Kyla.” The hurt in her voice was clear, and she paused, struggling to regain her composure.

###Chapter 76:
Taking a deep, steadying breath, Sadie continued, her tone steady but filled with unrestrained anguish. “While I was facing the most dangerous moment of my life, you cut off my only lifeline. And now, here you are, pretending to care, as if nothing happened. Do you even realize how ridiculous that is?”
Each accusation hit Noah like a dagger. A sinking feeling gripped him—something important was slipping through his fingers.
“Sadie, please understand, it wasn’t like that,” Noah pleaded, his voice breaking. “At that time, Kyla was…” His voice cracked, his regrets choking the words before they could escape.
Kyla had had a heart attack, and he needed to be there for her, to hold her hand so she couldn’t remove the oxygen mask—but it didn’t have to be him. At the same time, Sadie was on the verge of death, her life hanging by a thread, and he was the one who could have saved her.
Noah’s forehead glistened with cold sweat as the weight of his mistake began to settle in.
Filled with regret, Noah’s voice faltered, his words tumbling out in a desperate plea for redemption. “If only I’d known about the accident, I would have been there to save you.”
But Sadie’s face remained stoic, her voice cutting through the air like ice. “There’s no room for what-ifs here. The reality is what it is. You should go. I need to rest.”
Fear gripped Noah, a fear that leaving might sever their bond forever. Resolute, he positioned himself at Sadie’s bedside, his voice steady but soft. “I’ll stay right here. I’ll take care of you.”
As he spoke, a delicate fragrance lingered around him—unmistakably Kyla’s perfume—adding an unspoken tension to the air.
Sadie’s stomach roiled with unease. She was deeply unsettled by the thought that Noah, after spending time with Kyla, had the audacity to feign concern for her.
With a sharp twist of her body, she faced away and snapped, “Get the hell out of here!”

Alex wasted no time stepping in. He firmly grasped Noah’s arm, pulling him aside while his voice carried a stern warning. “Sadie just regained consciousness after the accident. If you actually care about her, don’t make this harder on her right now!”noveldrama
Noah’s brow furrowed deeply, his face a mask of impassivity as he settled into a chair beside the bed, simmering silently. Alex’s words felt like a deliberate taunt, stoking the embers of resentment within him.
Without hesitation, Sadie pressed the emergency call button.
Within moments, a nurse hurried into the room, her expression one of concern. “What’s the matter? Are you in pain?”
Pointing an accusing finger at Noah, Sadie declared, “He’s disturbing my peace. Could you please ask him to leave?”
The nurse’s demeanor shifted to one of professional firmness as she turned to Noah. “This is a hospital. We prioritize our patient’s recovery above all else. I must ask you to leave now. If you refuse, we will have to prohibit you from future visits.”
With a reluctant heave of his shoulders, Noah stood up and took a few begrudging steps towards the door. Pausing, he threw a challenging look back at Alex and demanded, “Aren’t you leaving too?”
Alex’s response was cool and measured. “Sadie asked for you to leave, not me.”
Noah’s fury surged once more, his fists clenching tightly as he turned back, ready to confront Alex again.
The nurse grabbed Noah’s arm. “This is a hospital, not a stage for your drama!”
With a decisive tug, she escorted Noah out of the room. The door slammed shut with a resonant thud, sealing him off.
The corridor was silent, save for the whistle of the cold wind that seeped through an open window at its end. The chill it brought barely compared to the deeper cold spreading through Noah.

###Chapter 77:
He was accustomed to being shielded by his privilege, and such dismissive treatment was unfamiliar to him.
He peered through the door’s glass, his gaze landing on Alex, who was dabbing at the blood trickling from his lip. The stark red against his skin was jarring.
Nearby, Sadie offered him a tissue, her eyes filled with concern—a look that was once reserved for Noah.
A sharp pain carved through his heart.
His fists balled at his sides, knuckles blanching, Noah lingered outside, the weight of his thoughts anchoring him in place.
Eventually, he turned away, his figure stretching beneath the corridor lights, exuding an unmistakable sense of solitude.
Settling into his car, he dialed Samuel. “Who runs this hospital?” he began, his voice a mix of frustration and determination. “Let them know that the Wall Group wants to collaborate. As for the terms… I want a seat as a partner in this hospital.”
He continued the conversation with Samuel, plotting his next moves carefully.
After hanging up, he reclined in his seat, his fingers rhythmically tapping on the steering wheel. The pace was controlled, almost casual, but the tension simmered beneath.
He would step through that door again soon—not as someone the hospital could throw out, but as a partner they couldn’t ignore. No one, not even Sadie herself, would have the power to make him leave her ward—he could stay as long as he wanted.noveldrama
The thought made Noah pause.
Did he really spend over ten million dollars just to make sure no one could keep him from Sadie’s bedside?
The thought clung to him stubbornly, refusing to dissipate.

Rubbing his temples, Noah felt a nagging ache spread across his forehead.
Confusion clouded his mind.
Was this surge of panic solely about Sadie’s accident, or was it the deep, piercing concern in her eyes that had thrown him off balance?
No, that couldn’t be it.
His heart belonged to Kyla.
As he wrestled with his thoughts, his phone shattered the silence, its abrupt ringtone slicing through the air.
“Mother” flashed across the screen.
He hesitated, then answered with a tentative, “Hello?”
“I heard Kyla had a heart attack. How is she? Is she feeling better?” Isabel’s voice crackled through the line, each word laced with palpable urgency.
Noah’s irritability peaked as he gave a terse, “Yes,” in response.
Isabel’s voice sharpened with concern. “Why this cold indifference, Noah? Kyla developed a heart condition saving your life. You should be by her side, caring for her deeply!”
Noah’s mind flashed back to the harrowing moment when Sadie called for help after her accident, and he had been steadfastly supporting Kyla. Wasn’t that proof enough of his dedication?
“Mom,” Noah began, his voice tinged with frustration. “Sadie got into a car accident. I just went to check on her condition.”
Isabel let out a dismissive scoff on the other end. “Well, as long as she’s still alive, I guess that’s all that matters.”
A frown marred Noah’s face as he registered his mother’s blatant disregard for Sadie, sparking an irritation within him that he couldn’t suppress. Compelled to defend his wife, he said, “Mom, Sadie is your daughter-in-law. You should Isabel cut him off sharply, her voice slicing through the tension. “I’ve never accepted her as my daughter-in-law! Didn’t you promise to divorce her? So what’s the holdup? Don’t tell me you actually like her now.”

###Chapter 78:
A heavy weight seemed to press down on Noah’s chest, squeezing the air from his lungs. He quickly countered, “Of course not!” There was no way he could have feelings for Sadie.
The mere thought was absurd.
A woman who was inferior to Kyla in every way could never capture his heart.
Relieved by his response, Isabel let out a soft sigh. “That’s good to hear. Just remember, Noah, beneath Sadie’s seemingly innocent exterior lies a cunning woman. She—”
Noah ended the call abruptly, cutting off Isabel’s complaints with a frustrated swipe. He knew that if she found out he’d spent ten million just to secure access to Sadie’s hospital room, she’d lose her mind.
Rubbing his temples to ease the mounting stress, Noah summoned Samuel to drive him home. Throughout the ride, he noticed Samuel glancing at him through the rearview mirror, a hesitant look on his face.
“Samuel, if you’ve got something on your mind, just say it,” Noah said as he closed his eyes to rest.
Samuel took a deep breath, choosing his words with caution. “Mr. Wall, considering Mrs. Wall’s accident and her condition, perhaps it might help if you were to comfort her. If you show genuine care, she will surely forgive you.”
Noah’s eyes snapped open, his gaze sharp as he stared back at Samuel through the mirror. “Who told you I’m interested in making up with Sadie? We’re on the brink of divorce!”
Samuel’s expression briefly stiffened before he quickly composed himself. “Understood, Mr. Wall. I shouldn’t have assumed.”
Silence enveloped the car, thickening the already tense atmosphere. Samuel kept his focus on the road, not daring to break the silence. The only sound was the low hum of the engine.
After about ten minutes, just when Samuel assumed Noah might have dozed off, Noah suddenly commanded, “Find out what Sadie likes.” Startled, Samuel nearly lost control of the wheel. “Huh?” he exclaimed.
gα?ησν?s?com makes every story special
Noah’s eyes opened slowly, his gaze piercing. “Why does that surprise you?”
“Sorry, Mr. Wall. I’ll get on it right away,” Samuel replied stiffly, his focus returning to the road, though internally, he questioned Noah’s stubbornness.
Meanwhile, in the hospital, Sadie looked at the bruise on Alex’s lip, her voice soft with remorse. “I’m so sorry,” she murmured. “It’s my fault Noah misunderstood you, and you ended up hurt.”
Alex wiped away the trickle of blood from his mouth and offered Sadie a gentle, reassuring smile. “Don’t blame yourself for what he’s done. His mistakes aren’t your responsibility.”
Stunned by Alex’s words, Sadie momentarily lost herself in thought. Over the years, she had melded her identity so completely with Noah’s—sacrificing her dreams, managing their home, and constantly putting herself in danger for his sake. Yet, the stark reality was that Noah seemed indifferent to her life and the life of their unborn child.
What did she truly mean to him? Was she just an expendable part of his life?
A sharp, lingering pain throbbed in Sadie’s heart. She squeezed her eyes shut, forcing herself to push the bitterness down. This time, she wouldn’t let it consume her. This time, she wouldn’t cling to someone who treated her like she was disposable.
Alex stood and walked to the IV stand, adjusting the nearly empty infusion bottle. The soft, rhythmic drip of the liquid filled the quiet room.
After a moment, he spoke, his voice calm and steady. “You’ve done enough for him, Sadie. It’s time to do something for yourself.”
Sadie’s eyes dulled with resignation. “I’m planning on divorcing him,” she admitted.
She sighed deeply, her brow furrowing with concern. “But there’s a complication. My grandmother desperately needs funds for her medical treatment, and I need a lucrative project to cover the costs. If I made too much of a scene with Noah, he could make things difficult for me.”

###Chapter 79:
Alex’s expression grew thoughtful as he processed her words. After a brief pause, he inquired, “What project are you considering?”
“There’s a fashion brand that’s embracing classic styles,” Sadie answered, a spark of enthusiasm in her tone despite the circumstances. “It perfectly matches my design skills. I’ve been trying to connect with them, but it’s been tough to break through.”
Alex raised an eyebrow, his voice tinged with curiosity. “Which one?”
“The Maple Group,” Sadie replied, her voice a gentle whisper, as if confiding a secret. “The CEO’s surname is Dominguez. Does that ring a bell?”
A mischievous grin slowly spread across Alex’s face, his eyes lighting up. “You should’ve led with that. Our families have been friends for generations. Consider it done.”
A flicker of excitement danced in Sadie’s eyes, igniting them with hope. “Really? Help me get that project, and I’ll owe you a dinner at the finest restaurant in town!”
Alex’s laughter echoed in the room, warm and infectious, enhancing his already striking features.
“It’s a promise!” he declared. “Once you’re on your feet again, I’ll arrange a meeting with Mr. Dominguez myself.”
Sadie’s spirits lifted, a soft blush tinting her pale cheeks. “It’s a deal!”
Alex reached over to press the call button beside her bed, signaling the nurse to attend to the finished IV drip.
As he stood to leave, his voice softened, filled with a tender earnestness. “Rest up. I’ll be here tomorrow to keep you company again.”
A wave of warmth washed over Sadie, her heart swelling with gratitude, yet burdened by the thought of the inconvenience she was causing Alex.
“That’s sweet, but really, I’ll be fine on my own,” she murmured gently, turning down the offer.

The concern in Alex’s eyes deepened, reflecting sincere compassion as he gazed at her. “Sadie, don’t shut yourself away from the kindness others offer. This world has its harshness, but there’s also a lot of kindness. Let yourself accept it; you deserve that much.”
The words made Sadie’s eyes brim with unshed tears again.
With a quick, shaky breath, she lowered her gaze to mask her vulnerability and managed a subdued nod. Her voice, thick with emotion, barely whispered, “Okay.”
After Alex’s departure, a heavy silence reclaimed the room.
Sadie pulled out her tablet, her fingers brushing over its surface before she immersed herself in crafting her presentation and refining her documents.
Next time she met Roy, she wanted to be ready—impressive enough to win him over.
The weight of her decision to part ways with Noah pressed heavily on Sadie, reminding her that, from now on, she needed to be her own anchor. Once a vibrant and promising designer, she had allowed her talents to dim in Noah’s shadow.noveldrama
But that was about to change. Determined, she vowed to herself that she would reclaim the value she had once placed on her own worth.
The following day, as the noon sun cast stark light through her window, Sadie’s eyes fluttered open. Groggy and disoriented, she squinted against the bright light and noticed a shadowy figure looming nearby. Assuming it was Alex, she called out, “Alex, is that you?”
But the response came in a harsh, irate tone that chilled the air. “Sadie, look carefully at who I am!”
Sadie’s eyes snapped into focus, her brow furrowing in distress as the figure before her became clearer.
Noah stood tall in his impeccably tailored suit, his presence commanding and his expression unyielding. Confidence and power radiated from him, but the fire of displeasure flickered in his gaze.

###Chapter 80:
“What are you doing here?” Sadie’s voice cut through the tension, her tone cool and detached.
“Oh, so I’m not supposed to be here?” Noah shot back, irritation lacing his words. “Or is it just that you’d rather see Alex? Sadie, let me remind you—you’re still my wife!” His voice, though steady, betrayed a flicker of vulnerability.
A tremor of emotion fluttered through Sadie’s heart.
She remembered Alex’s gentle words from the previous night, “You deserve that much.”
Alex’s voice carried a warmth that stood in sharp contrast to Noah’s cold indifference, wrapping around her like a comforting embrace.
Yet, she dared not let her guard down.
Dodging the brewing storm of their confrontation, Sadie steered the conversation. “When will you sign the divorce agreement?” she asked, her voice a mix of resolve and weariness.
Noah was at a loss for words, his complex gaze locking onto hers.
His eyes, deep and tumultuous, seemed to churn with a storm of unsaid words, but he swiftly quelled the rising emotions.
With a deliberate clearing of his throat to mask his unease, he slid a small box across the bedside table toward her. “Open it and see.”
Sadie didn’t care what Noah was up to—she just wanted him gone, the sooner, the better. So, she played along and opened the box. Inside, nestled among the soft fabric, lay a set of gleaming pink car keys for a Mercedes. They caught the sunlight and twinkled mesmerizingly.
“You’re giving me a car?” she inquired, her voice steady and devoid of any real shock.
Noah gazed at her, his lips slightly parted in anticipation. “Do you like it?” A subtle tremor of nervousness lingered in his voice, almost imperceptible.
Lаττ ch?ρτ?rs ιn glov?ls.
Before Sadie could muster a reply, the door to the hospital room burst open. Kyla strode in with effortless grace, her white dress flowing, a serene smile on her face.
“Sadie, Noah took me along to pick this for you. It’s pink—absolutely your color.”
Her voice carried a tinge of pride, bordering on arrogance.noveldrama
At those words, Sadie’s grip on the box tightened momentarily, irritation flashing across her face before she forced herself to relax. With a swift motion, she snapped the box shut and extended it back toward Noah. “Take it back,” she demanded calmly.
Noah’s expression morphed into one of confusion. “You don’t like it?” His eyebrows knitted together, surprise evident in his voice.
Before Sadie could respond, Kyla inserted herself into the conversation, her tone overly sweet. “Sadie, you really should accept this. It’s Noah’s gift to you, and if you don’t, he’ll always feel guilty.”
Guilty?
Sadie’s mind raced to the reason why. It was because when, battered from her accident, she had called for help, and Noah had hung up on her. What made it worse was his decision to bring Kyla here now, flaunting their bond as if to spite her.
As these thoughts swirled in her head, Sadie fixed Kyla with a sardonic smile and said with deliberate nonchalance, “Do you like it? I certainly don’t care for it anymore, so you might as well have it.”
Her words carried a hidden edge, hinting not just at the car, but at Noah as well.
Kyla’s face flushed with a mix of surprise and embarrassment. She was clearly stung by the implication that she was merely taking Sadie’s unwanted things. She bit her lip in visible distress and tugged at Noah’s sleeve, her eyes pleading. “Noah, did you hear what she said?”
Noah, catching the undercurrents of Sadie’s disdain, bristled with indignation. “Is it that you don’t like this car, or just the one I chose for you?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 81:
“Does it make a difference?” Sadie retorted, her voice dripping with icy detachment. “You’ve delivered your gift, now you can leave. And don’t make me press the call button to have you escorted out like last time.”
Noah gave a casual shrug, arching an indifferent eyebrow before settling into a chair beside Sadie’s hospital bed. With deliberate slowness, he picked up an apple and started peeling it, seemingly unaffected by the gravity of the moment.noveldrama
“Just so you know,” he said, his tone effortlessly composed. “I’m now a major shareholder of this hospital. If I run into a problem, a quick call to the director will take care of it.”
Sadie couldn’t mask her incredulity. “What the hell do you want?” she demanded, fixing him with a piercing stare that seemed to search his soul. “You made it clear you wanted a divorce, which I agreed to, yet you refuse to sign the papers. You ignored my calls for help during my accident, and now you won’t leave my hospital room. Noah, do you even realize how much you’re contradicting yourself?”
At her words, Noah’s hand stilled on the apple, a sudden discomfort gripping him. He was at a loss, torn between his feelings and his pride.
Remembering Sadie’s distant demeanor the previous day sent a jolt of pain through him, spurring a desperate need to mend things between them. Yet, his pride wouldn’t allow him to acknowledge how much he still cared about her.
His voice turned icy as he replied, “Don’t read too much into it. I’m here merely to offer some comfort, nothing more than a gesture of goodwill for the sake of our marriage.”
A sharp pang struck Sadie’s heart at his words. Her eyes welled up with unshed tears, but she fought them back fiercely. “I don’t want your pity,” she declared, her voice breaking slightly. “I’ve cried over you for the last time.”
As Sadie’s sorrowful confession hung in the air, Noah’s attention wavered. The fruit knife he was holding slipped, gouging a deep wound into his fingertip. A stream of blood trickled down, staining the apple’s flesh and spattering the pristine white bedsheet with startling crimson drops. Oblivious to the pain, Noah remained transfixed by Sadie’s desolate tone until Kyla’s alarmed voice broke through his reverie.
“Oh, Noah, you’ve hurt yourself!” she exclaimed, her concern palpable.
è ￠?ΔT?εЯ? ?η ?a?иoν.
Yet, Noah paid her no mind. His gaze remained intensely fixed on Sadie, his eyes shimmering with unspoken agony. It was as though he was searching for a clue in her features, but he hesitated to meet her gaze directly, fearing the vulnerability it might expose.
Kyla tugged gently at Noah’s sleeve, her voice sweet yet insistent. “We should clean that wound and maybe get a tetanus shot. It looks pretty deep, and it definitely needs some bandaging.”
Noah, however, didn’t respond, his gaze still fixed on Sadie, seemingly oblivious to Kyla’s concern.
With a subtle bite of her lip, masking her rising jealousy, Kyla turned to Sadie and pleaded, “Sadie, could you please tell Noah to see a doctor? He’ll listen if it’s coming from you.”
Sadie offered Kyla a mocking smile before her eyes settled on Noah with a serene expression, as if untouched by the tension.
Looking at Noah with a cold indifference that was uncharacteristic of her, she declared, “Noah, whether you’re bleeding is entirely your own issue. You could bleed out for all I care; it wouldn’t matter to me one bit.”
Noah stared at her, eyes wide with shock. Sadie had never spoken to him with such disdain before.
Kyla’s brow furrowed in disapproval as she turned to Sadie, her tone laced with reproach. “Sadie, how can you be so indifferent? Noah cut himself while peeling that apple for you. Shouldn’t you show a little concern?”
Sadie scoffed, amusement twinkling in her eyes. “Concern? Really, Kyla, let’s not be dramatic. How did Noah react when I was in that car accident? And now you expect me to fuss over his minor cut?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 82:
She stared at Noah, her gaze icy and detached. “Noah, really, do you think you deserve my concern after all that?”
Noah averted his eyes, a flush of guilt washing over his face. He clenched his jaw, inhaled sharply, and stood up. His voice was firm, devoid of warmth as he addressed Kyla. “We should head to the trauma department.”
It was as if the vulnerability he briefly showed had been nothing but a fleeting shadow.
Sadie watched their retreating figures, a smirk playing on her lips as they approached the door. Her marriage seemed nothing more than a bitter joke. In her heart, she wished she could erase these two from her life completely.
Just as she relished the newfound calm, a familiar voice rang out. “Sadie, I’m here. It’s time for your IV. I’ll keep an eye on it so it doesn’t run dry—just like I promised.”
At the sound of that familiar voice, Sadie’s gaze darted toward the door where she spotted Noah, Kyla, and Alex in a standstill. Noah and Kyla seemed on the verge of departing as Alex made his attempt to enter.
The moment was charged with an uncomfortable silence, the tension almost tangible in the air. Sadie exhaled a weary sigh. Memories of yesterday’s clash between Noah and Alex flashed in her mind, fueling her concern that Noah might lose his composure once more.noveldrama
“Come on in, Alex,” Sadie called out, her voice tinged with urgency, breaking the stillness.
Noah’s expression soured, his brows knitting together in clear annoyance. Despite everything, he was still her husband, and here he was, openly dismissed by Sadie! His ego bruised deeply.
Just as he opened his mouth to retort, Alex stepped inside and slammed the door with a resonant thud, narrowly missing Noah’s face. The sound echoed, marking the severity of the moment.
Noah’s anger flared, his usually calm demeanor crumbling as he felt the slight. He reached for the door handle, only to find it firmly locked from the inside.
Your update hub: g?lησνs?c?m
The door was shut and secured, a deliberate move to keep him out. His frustration boiled over into rage.
Giving his sleeve a small tug, Kyla said in a quiet, concerned tone, “You’re hurt. Let’s get that wound looked at.”
Kyla said, her voice heavy with suggestion, “We’re in a hospital, crowded with people at all hours. Even if they were overwhelmed by their desires, they wouldn’t dare cross the line here.” She was subtly throwing shade at Sadie with her sly remarks. Noah’s expression darkened, his voice tinged with impatient disbelief. “Sadie isn’t the type to act inappropriately,” he said firmly.
He didn’t believe Sadie would behave immorally. What truly irked him was the sharp contrast in how Sadie treated him compared to Alex.
Kyla hadn’t anticipated Noah’s instinctive rush to defend Sadie. A flash of jealousy surged through her, her fingertips pressing into her palm hard enough to leave marks, though her face remained composed with a gentle, considerate smile.
“Perhaps I’m overthinking things. Sorry about that,” she murmured, her voice soft but strained.
Together, they continued walking toward the department of traumatology. With each step, Kyla’s resolve hardened. She shifted her strategy subtly. “Sadie might not be the concern, but Alex could be a different story. I’ve noticed the way he looks at her,” she noted quietly, planting seeds of doubt.
This time, Noah fell into a troubled silence. Kyla’s insinuations acted like thorns pricking at his heart. He recalled his confrontation with Alex just the day before, prompted by the very suspicions Kyla voiced now. The memory of Alex’s tender, longing gaze directed at Sadie flashed before his eyes. It was the look of a man irrevocably in love, a look all too familiar to Noah, echoing his own deepest fears.
Kyla observed Noah carefully, her eyes narrowing slightly as she went on, “When a man is truly in love, he’ll pull out all the stops. Sadie’s just been through a traumatic car accident. She’s fragile right now. Don’t you think Alex might seize this chance to deepen his bond with her?” 
.
.

###Chapter 83:
Noah brushed off the suggestion with a wave of his hand, his voice resolute. “That’s out of the question. Sadie’s heart has belonged to me for years. The idea of her turning to someone else is unthinkable.”
His conviction seemed unwavering, but a shadow of doubt flickered across his face.
However, Kyla’s calm demeanor masked the sharpness of her words as they pierced through his defenses. “But just yesterday, Sadie asked you to leave her hospital room and chose to keep Alex by her side. Earlier, you came with a present and she barely cracked a smile. But Alex? She welcomed him with open arms. Doesn’t that seem odd to you?”
Noah’s response stalled, caught in his throat. Kyla’s words struck a nerve, cutting deeper than he expected. Sadie’s disregard for him and her attention on Alex felt like salt in an open wound, stinging with every moment.
As the antiseptic seeped into his skin, it drained the wound of its color, turning it a bleak, ghostly pale. The wound looked excruciating, but he didn’t make a sound, as if pain was nothing to him. The pain in his heart outweighed the one on his body. He looked distant, trapped in his own thoughts.
In the days that followed, Noah’s visits to Sadie became more frequent, each one marked by increasingly lavish gifts. From dazzling designer jewelry to one-of-a-kind antique artworks, the tables in the ward were adorned with opulence.
One day, he arrived with a jade-carved statue of the Virgin Mary in his hands.
“Sadie, I got this to keep you safe and at ease,” Noah murmured tenderly, setting the statue down beside Sadie.
Sadie cast a brief, indifferent glance at the statue, her eyes clouded with unspoken thoughts, and remained silent.
“Don’t you like it?” Noah probed cautiously, his eyes searching her face for any sign of affection.noveldrama
She lowered her gaze, her voice steady but distant as she responded, “Thank you.”
gα?ησν?s．?оm takes you away
A heavy weight settled in Noah’s chest. It was clear to him that Sadie was marking a boundary between them. The increasing feeling of detachment ate away at him, leaving him uneasy.
“Sadie, we need to talk,” Noah said, sitting close to her on the bed, desperate to close the emotional distance that had formed.
Sadie recoiled subtly, her body tensing as she sidestepped Noah’s reaching hand.
“There’s nothing left to discuss,” she stated flatly, her voice icy and detached, as if speaking to a distant acquaintance rather than her husband.
Noah’s features twisted, his brow furrowing deeply.
“Sadie, are you still blaming me? About that day…”
“That day?” Sadie cut in sharply, her tone laced with biting sarcasm. “The day you abandoned me to fend for myself, while I was barely clinging to life?”
Noah was speechless, his mouth agape. He had no comeback; her words struck a nerve.
With a heavy sigh, Sadie shut her eyes and inhaled deeply, gathering her composure. When she reopened them, a new clarity and determination shone through.
“Noah, I want a divorce,” she declared softly, her voice low yet carrying an undeniable ring of finality.
Noah was taken aback, the word “divorce” reverberating in his mind like a sudden clap of thunder. He was utterly unprepared for her resolute declaration.
“Sadie, you…”
“I’m beyond exhausted,” Sadie interjected, her voice tinged with fatigue. “I can’t keep living like this.”
Noah had more to say, his words poised on the brink of spilling out, but Sadie turned her back to him, her gaze defiantly averted. It was clear she had made her decision.
In the subsequent days, Noah’s presence remained steadfast. He visited her every day, each time with a new gift. Sadie no longer pushed his gifts aside in rejection. Instead, she collected them, listing each item on a popular online second-hand marketplace, selling them off one by one.

###Chapter 84:
The money garnered from these sales found its way into Laura’s medical account. She harbored no guilt; in her mind, it was merely claiming what she deserved.
On the morning of her hospital discharge, Alex was already there when she woke up.
He had taken care of all the discharge formalities and was holding a bouquet of lilies, their fragrance subtly permeating the air.
“Congrats on getting out of the hospital,” Alex said, his voice tinged with relief as he extended the flowers toward Sadie.
Sadie accepted them, a faint smile playing at the corners of her lips. “Thank you,” she murmured.
“So, where are you staying now?” Alex asked, worry flickering in his eyes.
Sadie’s voice carried a trace of uncertainty. “With my apartment canceled by him, I’m left without a place for now.”
Alex paused, considering her situation. “Not far from here, a friend of mine has a lovely guesthouse. It’s cozy, and she offers reasonable rates. I can talk to her about giving you a discount if you’d like.”
The idea of staying somewhere less conspicuous, somewhere Noah might not think to look, seemed appealing to Sadie.
She nodded slowly. “Okay,” she said softly. “Could you tell me where it is? I’d prefer to get there on my own, to avoid any further trouble for you.”
Alex’s smile widened, radiating warmth as he spoke with his characteristic gentleness. “Don’t worry about it. It’s practically next door to me—we’re going the same direction anyway.”
Sadie hesitated, her lips parting slightly in uncertainty.
She had initially planned to decline, feeling uneasy about the proximity to Alex’s place. The idea of staying so close to him seemed fraught with complications. Yet, with nowhere else to go—every hotel or guesthouse she contacted seemed under Noah’s influence, ready to turn her away at his behest—she found herself without options.
€$? ?н?tя? 1π ?alиoνε.
“Well…” She faltered, the word hanging in the air.
Alex, perceptive as ever, noticed her discomfort and inquired softly, “What’s the matter?”
As Sadie nibbled her bottom lip, her resolve weakened. “It’s nothing,” she replied, managing a strained smile. “Thank you for your kindness.”
She thought she’d stay at the guesthouse Alex suggested until she found something more permanent.
With the owner’s relaxed attitude and reasonable rates, Sadie had no trouble reaching an agreement.
As sunlight streamed through the window, its rays filled the room with the earthy scent of polished wood. Sadie inhaled deeply, feeling the knots of tension in her shoulders begin to unwind.
She turned to Alex, her expression softening with genuine gratitude. “Alex, I can’t thank you enough for all your support during this ordeal,” she said.
Alex’s smile turned tender, his gaze lingering on her face with an unspoken promise of protection. “It’s nothing, really,” he replied, his tone smooth and comforting, like a quiet reassurance.noveldrama
Reflecting on the countless ways Alex had been her unwavering support, Sadie felt a surge of warmth spread through her.
“There’s an upscale restaurant nearby with great reviews. Are you available? My treat,” Sadie offered.
Alex hesitated briefly. “Your doctor recommended a light diet for now—no seafood, among other restrictions.”
His gaze held a flicker of concern as he studied her.

###Chapter 85:
Sadie chuckled and said, “I won’t order anything I’m not supposed to. Come on, you’ve done so much for me. Let me show my appreciation.”
Her voice was light, yet firm, making it clear she wouldn’t take no for an answer.
A brief look of disappointment crossed Alex’s face, but he quickly masked it with a warm smile. “It’d be rude to decline, wouldn’t it?” Though his expression remained gentle, a quiet sadness lingered in his eyes.
They arrived at the restaurant and stepped through the grand revolving door. The glow of an opulent crystal chandelier bathed the space in dazzling light.
That was when the evening took an unexpected turn.
Sadie’s eyes immediately landed on Noah and Kyla, walking towards a private dining room together. Noah’s tailored suit and confident posture gave him an air of quiet authority, while Kyla, clinging to his arm, wore a sweet, knowing smile.
Sadie’s chest tightened. She instinctively wanted to avoid them, but Kyla’s sharp gaze had already spotted her.
“Sadie? Weren’t you supposed to be resting in the hospital? What brings you here?” Kyla’s voice carried a mix of surprise and something far less innocent.
Her eyes flickered toward Alex, and a smirk played on her lips. “You sure have time for romance, even while recovering.”
Noah’s attention shifted to Sadie, his expression darkening. His gaze held a storm of emotions—jealousy, frustration, and something unreadable. Sadie exhaled slowly, steadying herself. The last thing she wanted was to show weakness in front of Kyla.
“Is that really all your mind can process? Maybe you should get it checked,” Sadie said coolly, her tone laced with quiet defiance.noveldrama
Kyla’s smile faltered. She clutched her chest theatrically, her voice suddenly soft and fragile. “I was just worried about you. Shouldn’t your health come first? I didn’t think you’d snap at me like that…” The sickly-sweet tone was suffocating.
The silence that followed was thick with tension.

Before Sadie could fire back, Alex spoke up. “You’re the one who sounds unwell. Maybe you should see a doctor before it turns into an emergency.”
His voice was mild, but his protective stance made his meaning unmistakable.
Kyla’s face grew even more somber, her eyes glistening with unshed tears as if she were weighed down by an overwhelming sense of injustice.
She bit her lip, her shoulders quivering ever so slightly, casting a pleading glance at Noah, hoping he would take her side.
Yet, Noah’s gaze remained fixed on Sadie. His eyes were unreadable, his voice low and controlled as he asked, “Why are you and Alex here?”
Sadie responded evenly, “The same reason you’re here with Kyla.” Though her tone was composed, there was an unmistakable edge of defiance.
Internally, she scoffed. They were at a restaurant—what else would they be doing if not eating? Did Noah think she was a fool?
Noah’s expression hardened at her words. His sharp features grew taut, his eyes flashing with a mix of frustration and jealousy.
Today was Kyla’s birthday.
To celebrate, Noah had brought her to a high-end dining establishment.
Was Sadie perhaps celebrating Alex’s birthday as well?
He wondered how Sadie and Alex had grown so close.
Jealousy gnawed at him.
A recent conversation with Kyla came to mind.
She had mentioned that Sadie and Alex were often seen together. At that moment, Noah hadn’t thought much of it.

###Chapter 86:
Now, however, the thought consumed him.
A heavy feeling pressed on his chest, suffocating him.
His composure shattered.
“Let’s go home now!” Noah demanded, grasping Sadie’s wrist forcefully.
Sadie faltered and nearly fell from the sudden pull.
She resisted vehemently, her expression tight with frustration.
“Release me!”
Her wrist throbbed painfully.
Annoyance surged within her.
How dare he manhandle her in such a manner?
Noah’s gaze was intense, his voice brooking no opposition. “You don’t have a choice, Sadie.”
He contained his fury, his grip on her wrist unyielding, as if trying to fuse her into his existence.
Just as Noah tried to pull Sadie closer, Alex intervened, grasping her other wrist.
“Sadie’s not going back with you. Stop forcing her!” Alex said resolutely, meeting Noah’s eyes without faltering.
As he felt the tremor in Sadie’s wrist, Noah’s heart swelled with empathy for her.noveldrama
He spun around, his eyes sharp and focused intently on Alex. “Release Sadie now!”
The air crackled with tension, charged with an unspoken threat.
Suddenly, a loud “Bang!” shattered the silence.
Kyla had collapsed to the floor, gripping her chest.

Her complexion turned ghostly, her lips colorless, and her breaths shallow.
“Kyla!” Noah immediately turned his focus to her.
The sound startled Sadie, who instinctively glanced over at Kyla. With great effort, Kyla murmured faintly, “It’s… it’s alright… Don’t fret over me… I’ll… I’ll manage…”
Her voice trailed off weakly, each word seeming to be her last.
Noah’s expression darkened with a hint of annoyance.
The memory of Kyla’s chronic heart issue, a result of a past sacrifice to save him, flashed through his mind.
He quickly stifled his frustration.
His gaze shifted from Sadie to Alex, finally settling back on Sadie with a complex look.
“I don’t care what you and Alex are doing at the restaurant,” he said coldly, his voice sharp with authority. “Just ensure you return by eight tonight.”
A heaviness settled in Sadie’s chest.
His words pierced her like a sharp needle.
She clenched her jaw, remaining silent.
Alex continued to hold her wrist, feeling the slight shiver pass through her.
He glanced at her worriedly before easing his hold.
Noah bent down to lift Kyla, making his way toward the garage with a firm, unwavering stride.
As Sadie watched them leave, her heart ached with a searing pain, and bitterness welled up in her throat.
Despite his disloyalty in their marriage, Noah wasn’t prepared to let go of her.
He seemed determined to maintain control, keeping everything in his favor.
Truly, he was cunning.

###Chapter 87:
Sadie felt a wave of sickness surge through her, and she struggled to hold back the nausea.
She gently touched her abdomen, whispering reassurances to the unborn child. “Little one, don’t be scared. Mommy’s here to keep you safe. Daddy or no daddy, you are my precious treasure, and I’ll make sure you’re happy.”
Sadie had managed to cover Laura’s medical bills by selling the “gifts” Noah had given her.
Now, she needed to save money for the baby.
She knew that to raise her child alone, she would need a reliable source of income.
The ambiance in the restaurant was set by soft lighting and soothing music.
Taking a deep breath, Sadie looked across the table at Alex and said, “Alex, I need to talk about that project with Mr. Dominguez. Could you set up a meeting for us soon?” Her voice was soft yet insistent, her eyes conveying her resolve.
Alex’s expression softened with understanding. He recognized her need for financial freedom as a step toward cutting ties with Noah.
“Let’s do it tomorrow. I’ll organize a get-together and make sure he’s there,” Alex responded, his tone smooth and supportive. “Roy won’t say no to family friends.”
A thankful smile crossed Sadie’s face. “That means a lot. Thank you, Alex.” She reached to pour herself wine, but Alex stopped her.
“Remember, Sadie, you’re pregnant; you shouldn’t be drinking,” Alex cautioned gently.
Sadie’s hand paused, and her eyes momentarily flickered.
Alex then gestured to a waiter. “Please bring us some orange juice instead.”
Soon, the waiter brought the orange juice, and Sadie accepted it, tasting the sweet-sour liquid. While it refreshed her, it did little to alleviate the lingering sadness.
Stay tuned galnov.co
She lifted her glass of orange juice, toasting Alex. “Thank you, truly.” With a warm smile, Alex raised his glass and quickly finished his wine, appreciating Sadie’s resilience and her silent perseverance.
Later, Alex drove Sadie back to her temporary home at the guesthouse. When they arrived, Alex looked at Sadie as he parked the car.
“Noah has demanded you return. Do you plan to go back?”
Sadie firmly shook her head. “I like it here at the guesthouse. Please keep my location a secret from him.”
Respecting her wishes, Alex simply nodded and asked nothing more.
Leaving the guesthouse, Alex felt a lightness in his step. Despite her fatigue, Sadie exuded a captivating resilience tonight. He liked this side of her, reminiscent of a flower weathering a storm with grace.
“Hey there, young man,” called out Katie Rivera, the innkeeper, a chubby woman surprisingly nimble on her feet. She greeted him with a sly smile. Alex stopped and gave her a respectful nod. “What can I do for you, Katie?”
With a playful yet serious look, Katie asked, “So, do you have a crush on that young lady?”noveldrama
Alex quickly glanced back to make sure Sadie was out of earshot, relieved by the cover of night.
“I’m just helping a friend,” he responded quickly, his gaze shifting away from Katie to hide his discomfort.
Katie let out a knowing laugh. “Really, just a friend? Then why did you pay triple the amount to get the people who booked this place to cancel?”
Alex felt his cheeks warm under Katie’s teasing, his expression turning awkward.
He cleared his throat, eager to change the subject. “By the way, I’ll arrange a banquet for tomorrow and invite Roy.”
“Roy? Roy Dominguez from the Dominguez Group?” Katie’s voice was filled with surprise and disbelief. 
.

###Chapter 88:
Alex nodded, his expression serious. “That’s right. He’s your uncle, isn’t he? I need you to find a way to bring him to the banquet.”
“Don’t tell me this is about her again.” A playful smirk spread across Katie’s face, her eyes gleaming with mischief as she looked at Alex. “You do realize my uncle is a very busy man, right? Getting him to show up isn’t exactly easy.”
Alex touched his nose, a subconscious gesture that betrayed his unease. A faint blush tinged his cheeks as he felt Katie’s gaze piercing through his schemes, yet he struggled to maintain his composure. “Let’s cut to the chase, Katie. How much do you want to help me?” he asked.
Katie’s laughter filled the air as she teasingly held up five fingers. Without missing a beat, Alex, determined not to haggle over details, transferred $500,000 to her account.
The chime of the transaction notification echoed between them.
Katie’s eyes lit up with sheer delight as she glanced at her phone, her lips curling into a satisfied grin as though she could almost taste the sweetness of the money. “Wow, hitting the jackpot feels just like this, huh? I could definitely get used to it.”
Alex’s patience began to wear thin at her overt display of greed. With a slight frown, he brushed past her, his parting words carrying a stern warning. “Remember, Katie, fraud involving large sums can lead to prosecution. You’ve just pocketed half a million from me. If Roy doesn’t show up tomorrow, I’ll have no choice but to report this as fraud.”
Alex’s voice, though calm, was tinged with steely authority that commanded attention.
Katie felt a wave of surprise wash over her as the light from her phone screen danced across her features, revealing a tumult of emotions. The device in her hand suddenly seemed to burn her skin like a piece of scalding coal.
“Um… well…” Katie stammered, her eyes darting around as she desperately searched for the right words.
She watched helplessly as Alex walked away, her heart pounding in a frenzy of alarm. In that moment, she realized that Alex was not someone to be underestimated.

Snapping back to reality, Katie quickly dialed a number. “Hello, Uncle Roy…” she choked out, her voice trembling. “I need help!”
Meanwhile, Noah found the sterile scent of disinfectant in the hospital almost suffocating. After settling Kyla, the clock neared ten o’clock. He wearily pulled out his phone and dialed Samuel’s number.
“Has Sadie gone home?” he asked, his voice a quiet murmur, barely concealing his exhaustion.
Silence lingered on the other end of the line, stretching for a moment. “Uh, what? Mr. Wall, should I drive over and check?” Samuel’s voice wavered with uncertainty.
Noah hung up without responding, his heart racing as he rushed to Sadie’s ward, only to find it empty. He assumed she had already gone home.
Just then, his phone rang—it was Samuel. “Mr. Wall, Mrs. Wall hasn’t come home.”
Noah’s brow furrowed, annoyance bubbling up inside him. It was already ten o’clock at night; how could Sadie and Alex still be out having dinner?
With a growing sense of unease, Noah drove to the upscale restaurant. A polite waiter greeted him at the door and informed him that Sadie and Alex had left quite some time ago.noveldrama
Frustration mounting, Noah stepped into the cool night air, massaging his temples as he dialed Sadie’s number.
“Where are you?” he muttered under his breath, his voice icy and sharp with barely contained fury.
Meanwhile, Sadie’s phone lay abandoned on the nightstand, drowned out by the sound of running water from the bathroom. She remained oblivious to the relentless ringing.
The calls went unanswered, one after another, deepening the scowl on Noah’s face.
“She’s doing this deliberately,” he muttered, his teeth clenched in anger. Images of Sadie with another man flickered through his mind, unbearable and tormenting.

###Chapter 89:
A sharp, sudden fear coiled around his heart, squeezing it mercilessly. With a swift turn, Noah made his way toward the elevator, his steps firm and unwavering.
“Samuel, locate Sadie immediately! I expect an update in ten minutes,” Noah instructed, his voice cold and firm, leaving no room for opposition. Samuel, sensing the urgency in Noah’s tone, wasted no time in getting to work.
Shortly after, Noah’s phone buzzed with a new message containing the guesthouse’s address. Without hesitation, he set off toward the location.
Fresh from the shower, Sadie stood with a towel wrapped around her, droplets of water glistening on her shoulders. Suddenly, loud knocks echoed through the room, startling her and causing her heart to skip a beat.
She wondered who could be visiting her so late. Fear crept over her. For a moment, she considered calling out to ask who it was, but hesitated, not wanting to reveal she was alone. Instead, she opened an app on her phone to disguise her voice as a man’s.
“Who’s there?”
At the door, Noah paused, his hand frozen in mid-air. The unexpected voice shook him, even though he had prepared himself for any scenario. A surge of anger obliterated his composure.
“Sadie, let me in!” he growled, his voice icy with fury.
Inside, Sadie’s annoyance grew as she recognized Noah’s voice.
“Why are you here?” she retorted sharply, her annoyance clear.
Noah responded by banging on the door even harder.
“Open it!”noveldrama
His knocks grew louder and more determined. As the situation escalated, Sadie’s grip on her phone tightened.
“We’re about to get a divorce. Stop bothering me,” she said, trying to sound composed.
Feel inspired by ga ln o vels . com
“Focus on getting the divorce papers ready instead.”
In Noah’s mind, Sadie’s words hinted at a deeper motive.
Noah suspected that Sadie’s urgency to cut ties with him was due to the presence of another man, whom he presumed was in her room. He suspected that man was Alex, the one Sadie had left the upscale restaurant with.
His face reddened with rage, his teeth gritted. “You’re not opening, huh?” he spat.
Suddenly, with a powerful kick, Noah forced the door open. Splinters flew as the door hung precariously on its hinges.
“Stop! I’m calling the police!” Sadie screamed, gripping her bath towel tightly, fear evident in her eyes.
The sight of Sadie in a bath towel only fueled Noah’s fury further. His expression hardened, his features set cold and forbidding. He was now convinced more than ever that Sadie was having an affair with Alex.
Feeling utterly betrayed and furious, Noah ignored Sadie’s protests and barged into the room, scanning it intensely.
“Where is Alex?” he growled, his voice thick with menace.
He swept aside the curtains in his frantic search. Sadie’s disbelief grew. She tightened her grip on her bath towel and met his gaze fiercely.
“How would I know where he is? Are you out of your mind?” she snapped, her voice filled with frustration.
Noah scoffed, his scorn evident.
He stepped closer, his grip tightening on her wrist alarmingly. His gaze was so intense it felt suffocating.

###Chapter 90:
“You think you can fool me?” he seethed.
Without warning, he pushed Sadie onto the bed, towering over her, trapping her.
“Tell me! What’s going on between you and Alex?”
“Noah, this is ridiculous,” Sadie said, her voice trembling but defiant.
With every ounce of her strength, Sadie shoved Noah forcefully to the floor. Anger and disgust were clearly visible in her eyes.
Rising from the floor, Noah brushed off his suit, now speckled with dirt. Despite the mess, his confidence remained intact, formidable as ever.
“You think I’m being ridiculous?” he sneered. “Remember, Sadie, you are still my wife.”
As he spoke, Sadie instinctively retreated, biting her lip in defiant silence, determined not to show any vulnerability.
“Your wife?” she scoffed. “And what makes you worthy of being my husband?”
With a scornful laugh, Noah abruptly tore away the bath towel she clung to, leaving her skin exposed to the cool air. Sadie shuddered, but she suppressed the urge to scream.
“What are you trying to do?” she asked, her anger rising as he grasped her waist, his breath hot and forceful against her neck. Despite her fierce resistance, his grip remained unyielding.
“Let me go!” she demanded.
Fear overtook her, and tears carved trails down her cheeks as her hands feebly batted at Noah’s shoulders. Her voice trembled with despair as she spoke.
“I despise you, Noah Wall. I really hate you!”
Her declaration of hatred stopped Noah in his tracks. He froze, a sharp pain striking his heart, so unfamiliar it left him momentarily dazed.noveldrama
Exclusive updates gαlησνs.c?m
He couldn’t understand why her loathing hurt him so deeply. Looking into her tearful eyes, his face showed a mixture of conflicting emotions.
“You were the one who cheated on me first,” he murmured, his voice shaking slightly.
“I never cheated on you,” Sadie said through her tears, both terrified and furious.
She was baffled, unable to comprehend why Noah would continue to accuse her in such a way.
“You know exactly what you and Alex did in this room,” Noah said through clenched teeth.
Fury overwhelmed Sadie, and she swung her hand, striking Noah forcefully across the face.
A loud “Pak!” echoed through the room as her slap landed.
Noah’s head turned to the side, his cheek quickly reddening from the impact.
“Alex isn’t even here. How can you accuse me so falsely? Do you think everyone lies like you?” Sadie retorted, her voice sharp and filled with loathing.
Stunned by the blow, Noah momentarily grasped the reality of the situation.
It then dawned on him that Sadie’s appearance showed no signs of wrongdoing, confirming her claim.
Observing Sadie beneath him, her cheeks streaked with tears, her sobs making it hard for her to breathe, Noah felt utterly bewildered for the first time.
The pain on his cheek felt deeper than any loss he had ever experienced in his business dealings.
Slowly, Noah rose and stepped back, his movements clumsy.
His shirt, with buttons torn away, exposed his chest. His usual air of assurance was gone.
“I’m sorry. It seems I was mistaken. I…” His voice was rough, carrying an undertone of unease he hadn’t perceived before.
Sadie, however, had no interest in listening to him any longer.

###Chapter 91:
To her, his apology seemed ironic and hollow.
She clung to the quilt, gripping it as if it were a protective barrier. “Just leave! I never want to see you again!” she cried out, her voice raspy with emotion.
Noah, attempting to soothe her, moved closer.
Reacting swiftly, Sadie grabbed the bedside lamp and threw it at him. The lamp struck Noah and shattered on the floor, its breaking echoing sharply in the room.noveldrama
Noah released a muffled groan but held his ground.
His gaze was fixed on Sadie, swirling with a tempest of unspoken emotions, each layer more complex and obscure than the last. Sadie clutched the quilt to her chest, her body quivering, the tremors of fear evident in her tightened grip.
“Come any closer, and I won’t hesitate to call the cops,” she said, her tone as firm as it was fraught with anxiety.
Noah’s gaze remained on Sadie, unspoken words hovering on his lips before he forced them down.
He ached to reassure her, to diffuse the tension with explanations. Yet, the shadow of his past indifference and questionable actions stripped his assurances of their strength, leaving them feeble and unconvincing.
The rejection glaring back at him from Sadie’s eyes stung, a sharp pang of remorse slicing through him.
He drew in a deep, steadying breath, trying to quell the ache spreading through his chest. Accepting the inevitable, he knew that nothing he said would bring them any closer.
“Get some rest,” he murmured, his voice a low echo of his internal defeat.
With those parting words, Noah turned away, his departure marked by the soft click of the door closing gently behind him.
The room fell silent, leaving Sadie alone with the echoes of the night. Only then did she allow her defenses to crumble, her face buried in the softness of the quilt as sobs wracked her body.
Ltеst chαpt?rs in glovs.
She didn’t know when the tears finally stopped, but by morning, her eyes were painfully swollen and rimmed with red.
As she brushed her teeth, her reflection caught her off guard—a ghostly pale face with eyes puffed up like golf balls. Right at that moment, Alex’s call lit up her phone.
“Sadie, everything’s set for tonight’s banquet. I’ll swing by to pick you up before five this afternoon. No need to worry, Roy’s definitely going to be there,” he said, his voice carrying a warmth that felt almost tangible.
“Thank you, Alex,” Sadie responded, her voice rough and slightly strangled by the emotions she fought to keep at bay.
“Think nothing of it,” Alex replied, his chuckle light and comforting. “Get yourself ready. I’ll see you later.”
“Alright.”
Once the call ended, Sadie stared at her reflection, her fingers softly pressing against her puffy eyes. There was no chance she’d show up at that event looking like a disaster.
With a crucial meeting lined up with Roy to discuss potential business partnerships, she had to embody professionalism and competence. She couldn’t let personal feelings interfere with work.
This was her moment to forge a new path after her split from Noah; she couldn’t afford to stumble now.
Determined, Sadie quickly placed an order for cooling eye patches through a delivery app and applied them diligently while working on the project files that Noah’s disruption had left incomplete. These were crucial for her meeting with Roy.
Sadie kept going relentlessly, only stopping once everything was done — well past three in the afternoon.

###Chapter 92:
Soon, Alex arrived in his car.
With a crisp “click,” the car door swung open, unleashing a wave of stifling heat that enveloped Sadie. She grimaced slightly, her fingers clutching the door’s edge with a faint tremor of discomfort.
With a smooth stride, Alex approached her, offering his hand with a charming smile. “Be careful.”noveldrama
Managing a weak smile, Sadie attempted to straighten up, only to be caught by a wave of dizziness.
“Ugh…” she groaned under her breath, her body reacting on its own, tipping slightly forward.
“What’s wrong? Are you feeling alright?” Alex was quick to steady her by the waist, his touch brief yet firm, his eyes scanning her face for signs of distress.
Sadie pressed a hand to her forehead, her complexion paling. “I haven’t eaten yet. It might be low blood sugar,” she answered, her voice barely above a whisper.
Alex’s brow creased with worry. “That’s not good. Tonight’s banquet is all about mingling and making connections. You won’t get a chance to eat properly. Let’s grab something quick at a nearby restaurant first.”
The word “restaurant” echoed ominously in Sadie’s mind, tightening her chest with sudden dread.
A restaurant again.
The memories of last night’s dinner at the upscale restaurant, where they had stumbled upon Noah, flooded back. That chance meeting had led to so many misunderstandings, and now, regret gnawed at her.
Taking a deep, steadying breath, Sadie forced the rising turmoil down. There was no time to get lost in her thoughts—she had to pull herself together and get ready for the banquet.
“Would that make us too late?” She glanced anxiously at her watch—it was edging toward five. “If we stop to eat, we’ll certainly be late for the banquet.”
Feel the thrill at gα?ησν?s﹒o
Alex’s eyes darkened with concern as he studied Sadie’s pale face. “Is this banquet really that important?”
“Absolutely,” Sadie responded with conviction. “I’m meeting Roy to discuss a collaboration. If it works out, I’ll finally be able to open my own studio.” Her eyes briefly darkened with a touch of resentment. “Having my own business is essential for my independence.”
Seeing how important this moment was for Sadie, Alex decided not to press her about going to the restaurant. Instead, he fetched a small box of beautifully packaged candies from the car and handed it to her with an encouraging smile. “Here, take these for a little energy boost.”
“Thanks, Alex,” Sadie said softly, accepting the candies. She carefully unwrapped each one and placed it in her mouth. The rush of sweetness spread across her tongue but did little to calm her nerves.
Alex started the car, the engine purring as they pulled onto the road. The drive was smooth, and the streetlights cast fleeting shadows across Sadie’s face as she leaned back, her eyes closed, trying to steal a moment of rest.
From the rearview mirror, Alex observed Sadie’s serene facade. His fingers tightened around the steering wheel, his jaw clenching slightly. He wasn’t just going to stand by; he’d do whatever it took to help her get through this.
Meanwhile, unbeknownst to them, a Bentley trailed discreetly behind. Samuel kept a steady gaze on Alex’s car. The Bentley’s superior performance made it easy to maintain a close distance without drawing attention.
Samuel clicked his tongue, watching the car with mild amusement. “Well, well… Mr. Howe seems quite devoted to Mrs. Wall,” he murmured, recalling the photo he had taken earlier. 
.

###Chapter 93:
It showed Alex with his hand resting protectively on Sadie’s waist. The sight had sent an uneasy chill down Samuel’s spine.
Samuel let out a quiet sigh. His boss was completely oblivious, blind to how deeply he cared for his wife, unaware of the weight of his feelings.
Samuel could almost foresee a future where Sadie, drawn in by Alex’s unwavering care, slowly let her guard down until she finally leaned on him. By then, Noah would be left with nothing but regret, powerless to change anything.
Maintaining a safe distance, Samuel trailed the car to Alex’s neighborhood and parked a few houses down. He promptly sent Noah the location coordinates.
“Mr. Wall, I’ve sent the location,” Samuel murmured, his tone measured as he recorded the voice message.
When Noah received the photo of Alex resting his hand on Sadie’s waist, he assumed Samuel had deliberately framed it to exaggerate their closeness. He was tempted to scold him for acting like a gossip-hungry paparazzo, twisting reality with angles that made things look more intimate than they really were.
“Samuel, you rascal…” Noah muttered, his voice tinged with annoyance.
But when he saw the location Samuel sent, he was taken aback; it was the family estate where Alex had been raised, a place full of memories and significance. Realizing that Alex had taken Sadie there stirred a deep unease in Noah. Was Alex introducing her to his family? The idea sent a chill through him.
As this thought nagged at him, a surge of irritation overwhelmed Noah. His grip tightened on his phone until his knuckles turned white. “Could she be meeting his parents?” he whispered to himself, his voice laced with a mix of shock and a budding jealousy he hadn’t noticed before.
The rest of his business meeting passed in a blur. Noah’s mood cast a palpable shadow over the room, the atmosphere thick with tension. His presence, usually commanding and poised, now made the air around him feel oppressively heavy.
Finally, Noah said, his voice icy, “We’re done here.” He stood abruptly and exited the room, leaving a lingering chill behind.

In the grandeur of the banquet hall at the Howe family estate, the shimmering light from the crystal chandelier bathed the room, casting a warm glow over the elegantly dressed guests as they conversed in small clusters.
The hall was teeming with notable personalities from various sectors. Sadie clutched a glass of champagne, her gaze sweeping across the sea of attendees, her eyes keenly searching for Roy.noveldrama
At last, her eyes locked onto him; he was seated on a plush sofa in the far corner of the room.
However, the scene before her didn’t match her expectations.
Roy’s face was etched with discontent, his voice tinged with a sharp edge of reproach. “Alex, using my niece to make me come? That’s a bold move!”
Across from him, Alex lounged with deceptive ease, his smile unwavering as he dismissed the tension in Roy’s voice. “I had no choice. You’re a hard man to reach, Roy, and I had to make sure you’d attend. There’s someone here who’s eager to collaborate with you. Allow me to introduce you.”
As his eyes shifted beyond Roy, spotting Sadie’s approach, Alex’s smile widened invitingly. He gestured for her to join them. “Sadie, over here!”
Roy’s gaze snapped to Sadie. “It’s you?” he exclaimed, his expression laced with disbelief.
Meeting his eyes, Sadie nodded politely, her voice steady. “Hello, Mr. Dominguez.”
Despite her calm demeanor, her grip on the champagne glass tightened, betraying a flicker of nervous tension.
Roy’s gaze darted between Sadie and Alex, his eyebrows knitted in suspicion. “What is going on between you two?” The air thickened with his scrutiny.

###Chapter 94:
He had already picked up on something strange in the way Sadie interacted with Noah before.
Now, with Alex in the picture, his suspicions deepened, urging him to probe further.
A heavy weight settled in Sadie’s chest as she registered the sharp edge in Roy’s voice, an ominous premonition blooming within her.
She opened her mouth to clarify, but Alex was quicker.
“We’re close friends,” Alex said smoothly, his smile easy and demeanor untroubled as if he were discussing the weather. “If there’s one thing about Sadie, it’s that she delivers. Her business proposals speak for themselves. Mr. Dominguez, I assure you, listening to her pitch would be worth your time.”
His voice carried a barely detectable note of protectiveness, and his eyes flickered to Sadie with a fleeting look of concern.
Roy’s attention snapped back to Alex, his expression hardening. “You’ve gone to such lengths—hosting a banquet, even threatening my niece—and you expect me to believe you are just friends?”
Having encountered various personalities throughout his career, Roy was hardly the type to take someone at face value, and Alex’s explanations did little to sway him.
Roy had long understood that in the cutthroat world of business, deceit was more common than sincerity, and Alex’s demeanor suggested he was not doing all this just for a friend.
Alex’s smile faltered, freezing as he sensed the shift in atmosphere.
“I’m sorry. If there’s any need for cooperation, I’ll contact Noah directly. I see no need for middlemen,” Roy stated, his voice laced with disdain. He continued, his tone sharpening, “Miss Hudson, making connections is fine, but your attention should go toward more important matters.”
At his words, Sadie’s grip on her champagne flute intensified, her knuckles blanching with the strain. She inhaled deeply, a practiced smile masking her brewing storm. Alex’s face clouded with panic, and he stepped closer, urgency tinging his voice. “Mr. Dominguez, please, you’ve misunderstood…”
But Roy was done with the conversation. He turned on his heel to leave when Sadie’s voice, crisp and resonant, cut through the hum of the crowded banquet hall. “Everyone praises your business acumen, Mr. Dominguez, but it appears you don’t live up to your reputation.”

Roy halted, a flicker of surprise crossing his features. He was accustomed to admiration, and the sting of public rebuke ignited a flash of anger.
He pivoted slowly, his eyes narrowing, a dangerous edge to his voice. “Excuse me, what did you just say?”
Gently pulling on Sadie’s sleeve, Alex whispered urgently, “Sadie, forget it.”
He knew all too well how Roy preferred to handle things—with diplomacy rather than direct conflict.
However, Sadie shrugged off his touch, her lips curling into a sarcastic smile. “What’s the issue? Isn’t business all about using networks and leveraging connections? Don’t tell me you’ve never leveraged connections, Mr. Dominguez?”
Despite her casual tone, there was a sharpness to her words that was unmistakable.
Roy paused, his expression darkening into a scowl. His jaw tightened, and his eyes narrowed, clearly teetering on the edge of anger.
Sweat began to form on Alex’s palms as he clenched his fists tightly. Without thinking, he moved closer to Sadie, positioning himself as her shield if needed.
Despite the mounting tension, Sadie remained composed and unyielding.noveldrama
“Were my actions really that unacceptable, Mr. Dominguez?” she challenged. “You judge me as if I’ve done something wrong. Is it simply because I’m a woman?” She locked eyes with Roy, her gaze unwavering.

###Chapter 95:
“Here we are in the 21st century, and yet a CEO of your stature still believes women advance only through their associations with men.” With a soft chuckle, she added, “Isn’t that a bit outdated, Mr. Dominguez?”
Roy’s expression grew colder as he responded, “You think you have real talent?”
His tone dripped with disdain, as if he considered all of Sadie’s efforts a mere joke.
Anticipating such a response, Sadie retrieved a folder from her bag and presented it to Roy. “How can you judge my capabilities without looking at this?” she challenged. “Or are you worried that you might feel guilty after reading these documents?”
Roy’s squint hardened as he faced Sadie’s confident stance. He was aware that Sadie was deliberately provoking him.
Walking away would have been the wiser choice.
Yet, fueled by Sadie’s provocations, his anger surged uncontrollably.
The thought of being outsmarted by her was unbearable. Despite recognizing her strategy, Roy responded impulsively, “You’d better hope your skills match your confidence, or you’ll regret it in the end.”
Undeterred, Sadie locked eyes with him, her smile brimming with assurance. “We’ll just have to see what happens.”
Alex soon prepared the lounge for their discussion.
Roy settled into his chair, radiating authority with every movement. He casually took the folder from Sadie, ready to criticize its contents.
Sitting opposite him, Sadie remained poised and focused, bracing herself for a challenging encounter.
As Roy skimmed through the documents, his initial skepticism was evident. But with each page he turned, his demeanor shifted. His skepticism gradually faded as he became more intrigued.
The thoroughness of Sadie’s preparation and the clarity of her presentation were undeniable.
Every story starts at g ? ln σ ν s, com
After half an hour and having gone through all the documents, Roy acknowledged that Sadie was the most innovative and capable fashion designer he had encountered. He realized her designs would likely be highly successful in the market. They were also a perfect match for the new direction his company was aiming to take.
Today’s young people sought fashion that showcased their uniqueness and style. Previously, his brand had been synonymous with traditional elegance, which failed to resonate with the younger crowd.
Sadie’s fashion designs perfectly aligned with the latest youth trends. Roy set the folder aside, meeting Sadie’s eager gaze as he said deliberately, “Your designs are exactly what our company has been searching for.”
A wave of relief washed over Sadie as she smiled brightly. “I appreciate your approval, Mr. Dominguez. I’m eager to collaborate with you.” Victory seemed just within her grasp.
Rising from his chair, Roy made his way to the door. “However, we cannot proceed with a partnership.”noveldrama
“May I ask why not?” Sadie asked, taken aback, her fingertips trembling slightly. Was Roy still upset? She quickly added, “Please accept my apologies. I…”
Roy gestured dismissively, a trace of resignation on his face. “It’s not about holding grudges. I realized I jumped to conclusions about you too quickly.”
He sighed, looking back at Sadie’s earnest, yet somewhat pale face. “Noah spoke to me earlier. Any agreement should be discussed directly with him.”
Pausing, he added apologetically, “Attempting to bypass him to work directly with me would be inappropriate.”
Roy exited through the door, his parting words lingering in the air. “Miss Hudson, I regret this. While your designs are outstanding, we can’t proceed under these conditions.”

###Chapter 96:
As he disappeared through the doorway, Sadie watched the door swing shut, her hand unconsciously clenching into a fist.
Despair overwhelmed her. She had hoped that her hard work would free her from Noah’s control and grant her independence. Yet, here she was, still bound by his influence.
What was her next move? Was escape from Noah’s grasp ever possible? Her hand rested on her belly, protectively guarding the growing life inside her. If she failed to leave Noah before her pregnancy became obvious, he might never allow the child to be born.
The memory of Noah’s cold expression and harsh words haunted her.
Taking a deep breath, Sadie resolved not to give up.
She had to leave, for the sake of her unborn child.
Alex approached, his concern evident. “Sadie, stay calm. I’ll speak with Mr. Dominguez. Given the long-standing relationship between our families, he might change his mind.” His voice was gentle and reassuring.
With those words, Alex hurried off, urgency in his stride.
Sadie wanted to call out to him, but the opportunity slipped away. Amidst the elegantly dressed crowd in the banquet hall, Sadie felt completely out of place. She turned and walked away.
The night air outside was refreshingly cool. Her phone buzzed—it was Alex calling.
“Sadie, Mr. Dominguez has agreed.” Alex’s voice buzzed with excitement. “He’s set up an independent project for you, one that doesn’t involve Noah’s oversight. What do you think?”noveldrama
Clutching her phone, Sadie realized this was a more favorable outcome than she had hoped for. Without Noah’s knowledge, there would be no chance for him to interfere.
“Alex, I’m so grateful,” Sadie responded earnestly. “How can I ever thank you enough for this?”
Every story unfolds at gα?ησν?s．
“Marry Alex, and you’ll be even,” a cold, sarcastic voice cut through.
Startled, Sadie looked up sharply.
Noah stood a short distance away, impeccably dressed in a sharp suit. His handsome face showed no warmth, and his deep, cold eyes were fixed on her.
A heavy feeling settled in Sadie’s chest.
Had he overheard their entire conversation?
“What, are you feeling guilty?” Noah stepped closer, his voice cold. “You promised last night there was nothing between you and Alex, yet here I find you together. What excuse can you offer now?” His voice was tinged with derision.
Sadie’s expression darkened as Alex’s worried voice filled her ear through the phone. “Sadie? What’s happening there? I can hear Noah— is he causing trouble? Tell me where you are, I’ll be right there!” Sadie’s heart sank. She dreaded another confrontation between Alex and Noah.
“Alex, listen—”
But before she could finish, Noah snatched the phone from her hand. With a swift motion, he ended the call and threw the phone into the nearby lake. The phone hit the water with a splash.
Despair gripped Sadie’s heart. Her eyes snapped to Noah, filled with anger. “Noah, have you lost your mind?!”
Noah’s eyes flickered with a chilling resolve as he gripped her wrist. “I can’t stand watching you talk to Alex!” he exclaimed, his words dripping with fury.
The pressure on her wrist was painful, but Sadie stood her ground, defiant. “We’re just friends!”
With a sneer, Noah taunted, “Don’t overestimate yourself, Sadie! Just because Alex introduced you to his family doesn’t mean you’re free. You’re still my wife, and until I sign those divorce papers, you’re not going anywhere!”

###Chapter 97:
A resounding slap cut through the tension.
With her free hand, Sadie struck Noah hard across the face. Noah covered his face with one hand and slowly turned to look at her, his expression dark.
As her breath quickened, Sadie’s anger surged. “I can’t believe I was ever in love with you,” she said, each word forced out painfully. “Marrying you was the greatest mistake of my life! Let go of me!”
Noah’s breath hitched. The unexpected words from her left him stunned.
The greatest mistake?
His lips formed a thin line, and his gaze turned icy as he stared at her. “You regret marrying me?” he taunted, his tone dripping with scorn. “Just say you’re dying to marry Alex! You’re after a divorce, aren’t you?” He suddenly tightened his grip on her wrist, almost crushing it.
“You’ll get it only when I say so!”
Noah then hoisted Sadie over his shoulder. For Sadie, the world seemed to flip, everything turning upside down. She felt completely humiliated and overwhelmed. Despite her efforts to escape, kicking and flailing, she achieved nothing.
“Noah, you bastard! Put me down!”
The sound of the car door slamming resonated with a deep echo. Sadie was thrown against the leather seat. Her head struck the window, disorienting her further.
“Noah! Have you lost your mind?” she cried out, trying to sit up. But Noah remained silent, flooring the gas pedal as the car zoomed forward. The outside world became a blur of lights and shadows as they sped past. Fear tightened its hold on Sadie, her heart racing.
What exactly was he planning to do?
The car came to an abrupt halt at Myrtlewood Estate, throwing her forward once again. Without hesitation, Noah unbuckled his seatbelt, got out, and pulled her from the car.
“Stop, let me go!” Sadie’s resistance was fierce. Ignoring her protests, Noah maintained a tight grip as he pulled her toward the villa.
Inside, Rosa paused her cleaning of an antique vase, looking up. Her face brightened at the sight of them. “Mr. and Mrs. Wall, welcome home! What would you like for dinner tonight? I’ll get started right away.”noveldrama
Noah appeared to have heard nothing, effortlessly lifting Sadie and heading toward the bedroom. Rosa remained still, her expression a mask of bewilderment.
With a loud thud, the door slammed shut.
Sadie was thrown onto the bed with force, letting out a soft grunt. She attempted to rise, but Noah’s firm hold kept her pinned. His tall frame pressed down on her, completely immobilizing her. Panting, Sadie fixed a defiant gaze on him and mocked, “Noah, isn’t this a bit low, even for you?”
Noah’s expression remained dark; he tightened his grip on her wrist without a word.
“You’re the one who wanted a divorce and the one who wanted to be with your true love,” Sadie’s voice trembled, but her tone was resolute. “I never stood in your way of the divorce, yet you won’t sign. Could it be… you’ve developed feelings for me?”
Her laugh was bitter. “Not that I care about your affections anymore.” Looking Noah directly in the eyes, Sadie said distinctly, “I don’t love you anymore.”
These words struck Noah like a dagger to the heart. A throbbing pain filled his chest, confusion clouding his emotions. Still, he masked his vulnerability with a stern facade, retorting, “Don’t kid yourself. Who could possibly love you?” His voice was cold, his dismissal sharp.
His gaze was devoid of any warmth, as if he saw Sadie as nothing more than a stranger.
A cold swept through Sadie, her heart constricting with a frigid sensation. Struggling to maintain her composure, Sadie said with a blank face, “Please move and let me go.”
Her tone was quiet yet resolute. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 98:
A line of tension formed on Noah’s lips, his eyes briefly flaring with anger. Instead of releasing Sadie, he pushed her wrists deeper into the mattress.
“You’re my wife,” he said, his words tight with anger. “I won’t stand by and let you get involved with Alex and betray me. You’re not leaving this house until you sever all ties with him.” His voice was quiet but menacing.
Disbelief clouded Sadie’s face as she looked up sharply. “Are you imprisoning me?”
Noah remained silent, his cold stare warning her of the seriousness of his intent.
He then stood and exited, his tall silhouette casting a long shadow across Sadie. The door closed with a loud thud, making Sadie’s heart jump.
She instinctively reached for her phone to seek help, but it was missing.
Then it hit her. Noah had tossed her phone into the lake.
Completely cut off, Sadie felt helpless.
She rose and moved toward the window.
From the window, Sadie observed the security guards, clad in black uniforms, positioned firmly at the villa’s base, vigilant and unyielding. Their presence effectively imprisoned her within the villa’s walls, eliminating any possibility of escape.
Retreating to the bed, Sadie felt the mattress envelop her like the confining bars of a cell. What was she meant to do?
Fury consumed her, especially after Noah’s rough handling had compressed her abdomen, causing increasing pain.
Sharp, consistent pains began to wrack her body. Beads of cold sweat emerged on her forehead as her complexion faded to a stark white.
Curled into a tight ball on the bed, Sadie shook uncontrollably.
As she wept, tears silently drenched her pillow.

“My darling,” she murmured, her lips trembling as she spoke so softly it was almost a breath. “Not now… If your father discovers our secret, we’ll be in danger…”
Clasping her stomach, she tried to form a barrier to protect her unborn child.
The relentless harshness of Noah, compounded by Kyla’s sharp words and relentless setbacks, had drained her completely—both body and soul.
She didn’t know how much longer she could hold on.
Yet, she clung to one clear purpose: safeguard her unborn child.
That child represented her only beacon of hope.noveldrama
Despite the hours passing, the ache in her abdomen persisted relentlessly.
Gradually, Sadie’s surroundings blurred as weariness and pain clouded her consciousness.
She cried until fatigue overtook her and she drifted into a deep sleep.
Meanwhile, Noah brooded in his office, the golden whiskey in his glass catching the light as he moved, mirroring his troubled mood.
Sadie’s defiant words tormented him, echoing in his mind.
“Who does she think she is, telling me she doesn’t love me anymore?” he muttered, scoffing as he swallowed his drink. Despite the warm trail it left, his anger remained unquenched. “As if her words could affect me. Absurd!”
With a forceful gesture, he set the glass down, its clink resounding in the quiet room.
Suddenly, he grabbed his phone and dialed Samuel’s number.
“Bring Kyla to Myrtlewood Estate immediately,” he instructed, his voice cold and detached.
Samuel’s voice came through the phone, laced with uncertainty. “Why? Myrtlewood Estate was meant to be a haven for you and Mrs. Wall. Isn’t it wrong to have Miss Wade move in? Mrs. Wall would be devastated if she knew.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 99:
“Devastated?” Noah scoffed, his voice thick with disdain. “She won’t be devastated. Better yet, I hope it crushes her completely!”noveldrama
The fury in Noah’s tone was unmistakable to Samuel, who sensed that something grave had upset him.
Samuel felt compelled to urge Noah to reconsider. “Mr. Wall, please… try to calm down,” he suggested carefully.
“I am calm,” Noah insisted, taking a slow, deep breath to control his rising anger. “Just do as I say and bring Kyla to Myrtlewood Estate now, or consider yourself fired!”
He abruptly ended the call, reaching for his glass to gulp down the last of his drink.
Hearing the disconnect tone, Samuel exhaled a weary sigh.
The situation was escalating. Noah was determined to stir up trouble. Samuel had a sinking feeling about the impending fallout but felt powerless against Noah’s direct threat.
Noah poured himself another drink, seeking solace in alcohol, yet the inner chaos only intensified.
Visions of Sadie’s defiant stare and her biting words haunted him, each memory stabbing at his conscience like a relentless blade.
Frustrated, he yanked at his tie, feeling each breath grow laboriously heavy.
He puzzled over his own rage. He had initiated their separation and been unfaithful, so why did Sadie’s declaration of lost love incite such bitterness?
A fleeting thought crossed his mind—could he have feelings for her?
He dismissed the notion almost instantly.
He shook his head firmly, determined to banish such thoughts from his mind.

When Samuel arrived at Myrtlewood Estate with Kyla, he found Noah already drunk—sprawled across the study’s sofa, eyes barely slits in his flushed face.
“Mr. Wall?” Samuel called out, his voice cautious.
He moved to help Noah to his room, but a slender hand caught his arm. “I’ll take care of him,” Kyla murmured.
Samuel mustered a strained smile. “Mr. Wall’s not exactly light—Wade. Let me do it.”
It was a flimsy excuse. The truth was, Samuel didn’t want to be anywhere near Noah, especially while Noah was drunk.
This wasn’t because he favored Sadie over Kyla; his loyalty lay squarely with Noah, not with Sadie or anyone else.
As Samuel supported Noah, he felt like he was carrying a sack of bricks. The overwhelming blend of alcohol and Noah’s usual heavy, woody cologne made his head swim.
Noah groaned, his brow creased, as though even unconscious, he couldn’t escape his troubles.
Kyla trailed silently behind them, her eyes glinting with a strange cocktail of satisfaction and unease she couldn’t quite shake.
“Samuel, are you sure you can handle that?” Kyla’s voice dripped with a subtle mockery, just enough to grate on Samuel’s nerves.
Sweat trickled down his temple. “Don’t worry, Miss Wade. I’ve got it.” In truth, Samuel was silently cursing his misfortune. This wasn’t assisting a boss—it was like hauling deadweight uphill, with Kyla’s sharp gaze stabbing at his pride.
“Good,” Kyla murmured, her eyes slicing through him with a glacial glare.
A chill crawled up Samuel’s spine. All he wanted was to dump Noah in bed and escape this place.
He knew Noah cared about Sadie—even if the man hadn’t realized it yet.
As his loyal assistant, Samuel’s job was to keep Noah safe from opportunists, especially in this drunken stupor.

###Chapter 100:
Kyla watched him struggle with barely concealed amusement, a cold smile tugging at her lips. “Samuel, are you trying to come between me and Noah?”
Samuel, now drenched in sweat, shook his head quickly. “Of course not. It’s just… Mr. Wall is really heavy.”
Kyla chuckled, a sound devoid of warmth. “Fine. Help me get him to the bed. After that, you can stop worrying.”
Samuel swallowed a groan. He’d have been better off staying out of this mess altogether.
But with Kyla making the request—and knowing Noah rarely denied her anything—he couldn’t exactly refuse.
Reluctantly, he followed Kyla’s lead, helping Noah to the bedroom door, wishing he were anywhere else.noveldrama
Taking a steadying breath, Samuel nudged the bedroom door open.
But as it creaked wide, both he and Kyla froze in their tracks. There, sprawled across the master bed, was Sadie—her breathing slow and even, lost in deep sleep.
Her face, though pale and shadowed with fatigue, still held an effortless, delicate beauty that seemed to glow in the dim light.
Kyla’s expression darkened instantly. The smug confidence she’d worn like armor melted away, replaced by a venomous mix of jealousy and rage.
She bit her lip hard, so much so that it nearly drew blood.
“Well…” Samuel managed to say, his voice thin with shock. Sadie asleep in Noah’s bedroom was the last thing he thought he’d stumble upon tonight.
Kyla inhaled sharply, her fury simmering beneath the surface. She leaned toward Samuel, her voice a low, icy whisper. “Take him to the guest room.”
The warmth had bled from her tone, leaving nothing but cold steel.
g?lnσνes?com is your update hub
She had believed Noah invited her to move into Myrtlewood Estate out of love, but finding Sadie—so comfortably ensconced in the master bedroom—felt like a slap to the face.
Kyla’s fists clenched at her sides, the bitter taste of regret rising in her throat. She should’ve gotten rid of Sadie long ago.
Samuel, however, felt an unexpected wave of relief wash over him. With Sadie here, the chances of anything reckless happening between Noah and Kyla seemed slim.
Without another word, he guided Noah’s dead weight toward the guest room. The moment Noah was settled, Kyla turned to Samuel with a sharp glare, her voice flat and final. “You should get going.”
Kyla tiptoed toward the bed where Noah lay, holding her breath as she neared him.
Under the faint light, Noah’s defined features became more pronounced.
His eyes were firmly closed, long lashes casting slight shadows. His lips remained just barely parted.
Charm seemed to radiate from him even in sleep.
Many times, Kyla had imagined making her dreams a reality, yet Noah had never touched her.
At last, the moment she had yearned for was within reach!
Her heart thudded loudly.
Kyla’s fingers shook slightly as she reached for Noah’s belt.
The belt clicked open, but simultaneously, Noah’s hand gripped hers. Her heart stuttered as panic flickered in her eyes, and she met his gaze, which was devoid of emotion.
Kyla froze, breathless with shock.
As she braced for confrontation, Noah’s raspy voice broke the silence, asking, “Sadie?” 
.

.
###Chapter 101:noveldrama
That single question, laden with confusion, stabbed at Kyla’s heart.
It was Sadie he saw in his half-awake state, not her!
Kyla felt her heart shattering, as if cut by a sharp blade.
She stood there rigidly, clenching her fists tightly.
A sudden stab of jealousy hit Kyla.
Internally, she cursed, wishing the recent car accident had killed Sadie.
Yet, despite her bitterness, Kyla recognized the crucial nature of the moment.
She inhaled deeply, calming her anger, and murmured, “Noah, you’re drunk. Let me wipe your face.”
Noah loosened his hold on her wrist, murmuring an indifferent “Mm.” This compliance was uncharacteristic; Noah was usually commanding and assertive around her, yet now he seemed subdued and easy to sway
Kyla’s fingers whitened as she twisted a towel dry, then gently dabbed at Noah’s face.
The cold water might have begun to wake him, as Noah’s senses gradually sharpened.
Upon opening his eyes and seeing Kyla, he frowned, and his demeanor instantly chilled.
He brushed her hand away and said bluntly, “Get out.”
Kyla’s small spark of hope crumbled with those few words.
“Noah, let me look after you…” Kyla’s voice faltered, her eyes welling up as she spoke.
“I said, get out.” Noah’s voice grew even colder.
A sting of pain shot through Kyla’s heart, prompting her to exit the room.
gα ?η σ ν s?com holds great reads
She collapsed onto the sofa in the living room, her thoughts simmering with resentment.
Rising abruptly, Kyla began to pace, her frustration mounting. She slipped out to the garden, glanced around to ensure privacy, and then pulled out her cellphone to make a call.
“Why didn’t Sadie die in the car crash you staged?” Kyla demanded, her voice laced with restrained fury.
From the other end came a leisurely, mocking reply. “What’s the matter, my lady? Why so upset? That mishap certainly caused enough drama.”
Drawing in a deep breath to calm her rage, Kyla said, “Set up another accident. Make sure Sadie doesn’t survive this time.”
A chuckle resonated from the other end, amused and taunting. “I can’t.” Kyla’s temper flared, and she raised her voice. “And why not? How dare you refuse—”
She was abruptly cut off by the hacker.
“Have you forgotten the deal we made?” the hacker said, his voice calm, almost amused. “You still owe me for that favor, and now you want me to stage another accident?”
Kyla froze, her fingers tightening around her phone.
The memory hit her like a slap. She had made a deal with him, hiring him to engineer a car accident. His price? A night with her. At the time, she hadn’t flinched—so desperate was she to erase someone from the picture.
A flicker of shame bubbled up, but she shoved it down.
They’d been intimate more than once; there was no reason to act coy now.
Besides, anger burned hotter in her chest, and she needed an outlet—something raw and reckless to match the storm inside her.
Pulling up her phone, she searched for the nearest luxury hotel to Myrtlewood Estate. Once she found one, she shot the hacker a message with the location. “Go there. I’ll book a room.” 
.

.
###Chapter 102:
On the other end of the line, she heard the faint hiss of a cigarette being stubbed out, followed by a low chuckle. “So eager? You’ve always been wild.”
Kyla’s lips curled into a bitter smile. Her voice was sharp, teetering between frustration and challenge. “Are you coming or not? If not, forget it!”
There was a beat of silence before the hacker’s amused voice returned. “Oh, I’m coming. But it’s been too long since our last time. I’m extremely horny now. You’d better be ready.”
The sound of his heavy breathing over the line sent a shiver down Kyla’s spine, her legs suddenly weak beneath her.
She ended the call abruptly, her fingers trembling as she rushed to book the room.
Impatience gnawed at her. She couldn’t even wait for the hotel staff to hand over the key. Instead, she slipped into the public restroom, taking a hurried shower, as if washing away the residue of the night’s frustrations.
When she finally stepped into the room, the hacker was already there. The faint scent of tobacco mingled with his distinct, musky cologne, filling the air and making her head spin. He stood by the window, his gaze flickering to her wet hair, and a hungry gleam lit up his eyes. Without a word, he crossed the room and pulled her into his arms.
“Kyla, you’re becoming more irresistible every time I see you.”
She let out a soft laugh, playfully pushing the hacker back, though her touch lacked any real resistance.
They tumbled into a night of reckless abandon.
By the time dawn crept over the horizon, the hotel room was a chaotic mess of tangled sheets and discarded clothes.
Kyla groaned as she pushed herself up from the bed, her body aching, especially around her waist. Bruises mottled her skin, stark against the early morning light. She winced as she dressed, her movements stiff and deliberate.
While she was buttoning her blouse, her voice cut through the thick, stale air. “I’ve repaid the favor from last time. Now, make sure you arrange another ‘accident’ for Sadie. This time, I want her dead.”
Feel the thrill on gα?ησν?s?c?m
The hacker, still lounging lazily against the headboard, lit a cigarette. He took a long drag before releasing a plume of smoke into the room, his lips curling into a smirk. “With all the effort you put in last night, I promise,” he drawled.
Kyla knew exactly what he meant by “effort.”
She shot him a look, equal parts annoyance and teasing. “As long as you play your part, once I become Noah’s wife, you’ll be well compensated.”
The hacker chuckled darkly, his laughter low and taunting. “Noah’s reputation might be squeaky clean, but who would’ve thought his beloved would turn him into a cuckold?”
Kyla rolled her eyes, ignoring his crude amusement. She had no time for his jabs. Her focus was razor-sharp now—Sadie had to be eliminated, and Noah would be hers.
She finished dressing, grabbed her bag, and walked out without a backward glance.
The hacker’s grin faded as he watched the door click shut behind her. His eyes hardened, the amusement replaced by a cold, calculating glint. “Noah, your reckoning is coming,” he muttered, flicking ash onto the floor.
When Kyla returned to Myrtlewood Estate, the first light of morning stretched across the sky. Rosa hadn’t arrived yet, and the house was cloaked in silence.
Kyla slipped into an empty guest room, scrubbing herself clean of any lingering traces of the night. She dressed carefully in long sleeves and pants, making sure every bruise and mark was hidden from sight.
As Kyla emerged from the room, she caught sight of Noah lingering by the master bedroom door, his knocks soft and hesitant.
“Sadie, I get that you’re upset with me, but neglecting your health just to make a point is reckless! Do you really think skipping breakfast will make me feel sorry for you?”noveldrama
There was an undertone of urgency in his voice, his brow slightly furrowed.

###Chapter 103:
His words carried a note of reprimand yet were underscored by genuine concern.
Kyla clenched her fists, her nails pressing into her palms.
In her mind, if Sadie succumbed to her illness, all the better—she wouldn’t have to get her hands dirty at all.
At that moment, the master bedroom door creaked open.
Sadie stood there, her complexion ghostly, a sheen of sweat glistening faintly on her brow, her body emanating frailty and fatigue.
“How many times do I have to repeat myself? I don’t want to eat,” she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper, trembling with frustration.
Noah’s face softened immediately. He stepped closer, extending a hand to check her forehead.
“Are you feeling alright?” he inquired, concern lacing his words. Yet, Sadie turned away sharply, her cheeks shadowed with a mix of hurt and defiance.
A flicker of bitterness tightened her lips.
Yesterday’s harshness from Noah had left her reeling, not just emotionally but physically too, leading to complications in her pregnancy and a burning fever.
All of it was his fault. Now he dared to show concern? Was she seriously supposed to let this go? No way in hell!
“Just leave me alone,” she said, her voice cold and flat, slicing through the tense air.
Noah shifted his attention to Rosa, who was standing nearby, unease written on her face. “Rosa, make some plain soup,” he instructed firmly.
His gaze briefly met Kyla’s, who stood not far away. He acknowledged her with nothing more than a dismissive glance before turning back to Sadie with a commanding tone that brooked no argument. “Go back and lie down. I’m calling the doctor now.”
A pang of anxiety gripped Sadie’s heart, pulling a rash, desperate response from her.
The place for great stories: g?lnσνs?com
“Don’t!” The word escaped her lips with a tremor, betraying her fear.
“I’ll just stay warm and sweat this thing away.”
The looming threat of a doctor’s visit terrified her.
It would unveil her secret pregnancy, a revelation she feared Noah would never accept.
This child was both her last beacon of hope and her deepest vulnerability.
Noah’s brow deepened into a troubled furrow as he pressed on,
“You’ve been throwing up lately and are burning up with a fever now. You’re clearly unwell, yet you stubbornly refuse to see a doctor. Are you hiding something from me?” His tone was demanding, laced with concern and frustration.
Sadie averted her gaze, her eyes darting nervously, betraying her reluctance to confront his questioning.
“Of course not,” she replied, her voice a strained whisper of feigned calm. “It’s just… doctors tend to pry too much into my life.”noveldrama
On the sidelines, Kyla observed the tense exchange with a simmering blend of jealousy and resentment.
Her eyes lowered, masking the storm brewing within.
Seriously? Sadie thought Noah would care about her with this act? She was dumber than she looked.
Noah, his face a mask of stoic indifference, whipped out his phone. His long fingers danced across the screen with practiced ease as he made a call.
“You’ve been in Jim’s care before. It’s just another check-up. Why act like it’s a big deal now?” he questioned, his voice smooth.
At the mention of “Jim,” a visible wave of relief washed over Sadie. Jim was among the few who knew of her pregnancy and had vowed to keep it a secret.
She trusted him implicitly, and the mere thought of his support seemed to soothe her fraying nerves.

###Chapter 104:
As Noah ended the call, his expression softened, his voice gentle. “Just wait for a while. Jim will be here before you know it.”
With a slight nod, Sadie’s attention drifted toward the window, her thoughts swirling.
Sadie knew she needed to reach out to Alex. He was her last chance to escape this place.
Jim’s visit could be her break.
Kyla’s eyes darted between Sadie and Noah repeatedly.
Observing the shift from tension to ease on Sadie’s face, Kyla grew suspicious, sensing that something was off.
Her instincts whispered that Sadie was concealing something important from Noah.
But what could it possibly be?
Interrupting her thoughts, Noah’s voice resonated, “Kyla, you’ve put in the effort last night looking after me. Why don’t you grab a bite and refresh yourself?” His voice was deep and captivating.
A flutter of warmth passed through Kyla as her heart momentarily skipped a beat.
He actually cared about her!
It was unusual for Noah to show such personal concern, sparking curiosity about his different behavior today.
Doubt briefly crossed her mind, but it was swiftly overtaken by a rush of satisfaction.
With a sidelong glance at Sadie, Kyla responded to Noah, “I did what I should. Shall we head to the dining room together?”
Agreeing with a nod, Noah began to walk with Kyla toward the dining room.
L?t?st chαpt?rs in glnovels.
He couldn’t resist a backward glance at Sadie, as if searching for a sign of emotion.
Finding none, he quickly turned and hastened to catch up with Kyla. Upon entering the dining room, Noah courteously pulled out a chair for Kyla.
Caught off guard by the gesture, Kyla released a victorious smile.
She reveled in the attention, feeling more like his rightful partner.
All the while, Sadie watched quietly.
She had no resentment, only a deep sense of weariness.
Turning away, she gently closed the door to the master bedroom, silencing the sounds from the dining room.noveldrama
Everything finally became quiet.
Jim, carrying a medicine box, rushed into the house, his forehead dotted with sweat.
Upon spotting Noah, he eased up a bit and inquired, “Where’s Sadie?”
“Just follow me,” Noah responded briefly.
Kyla quickly set her utensils aside, her eyes alight with eagerness as she whispered, “Noah, I want to come along to see Sadie because…” She trailed off, seeming to search for the right words, then continued, “There are some misunderstandings between us that need to be cleared up face-to-face.”
Noah didn’t , simply saying flatly, “Let’s go.”
Rising, he took the lead toward the master bedroom.
Kyla was right behind him, a subtle smile of anticipation playing on her lips.
Catching sight of Kyla, Jim froze for a moment before staring at Noah in disbelief. “You’ve actually put Kyla and Sadie in the same house?”
Noah stopped, giving Jim a look of mild annoyance. “Why does it bother you? Sadie isn’t bothered. She doesn’t even care. What’s got you so agitated?”
Jim was momentarily speechless.
He inhaled deeply, and after a pause, he shook his head and muttered, “Never mind. You’re truly blind, Noah. Just don’t come to regret this.”

###Chapter 105:
“What do you mean by that? I’m blind to what?” Noah’s expression darkened.
Jim remained silent, only gesturing towards the door as he told Noah and Kyla, “I have to go in and see to the patient. Wait here, please.”
“Why should I stay out? Sadie is my wife,” Noah retorted, puzzled.
This was not the first time Jim had come to his house to attend to Sadie, and Jim hadn’t asked him to leave them alone before.
Noah eyed Jim with suspicion, his gaze piercing. “You’ve been close to Sadie lately. Are you hiding things from me?”noveldrama
Jim felt a tightness in his chest, his gaze flickering.
He doubted Noah’s abilities as a father. Resolute, he was prepared to shield Sadie’s secret pregnancy from him.
Jim steadied himself, drawing in a deep breath to quell the turmoil churning inside.
Lifting his gaze to Noah, he let out a sharp, pointed remark. “Mr. Big Shot, of course, you can go in. But are you certain you won’t make things worse? If the patient refuses to cooperate and I can’t treat her, don’t come pointing fingers at me.”
Noah’s brows furrowed tighter, his eyes clouded with confusion and hesitation.
His lips pressed into a thin line, but no words came.
Jim didn’t press. Instead, he simply swung open the door to the master bedroom, stepping to the side with a slight, almost dismissive wave. “This is your house, your kingdom. Naturally, you can go in if you wish.” He met Noah’s gaze with a steady one of his own. “But if things go south, that’s on you.”
Noah’s jaw tightened, his expression hardening. He could feel the weight behind Jim’s words.
Jim’s forthrightness made Noah second-guess his own suspicions.

His mind flashed back to that morning—Sadie refusing to open the door, her coldness gnawing at his patience. A surge of frustration bubbled to the surface.
“Forget it,” Noah snapped, his voice laced with defiance and something unspoken beneath. “It’s not like I wanted to go in anyway.” He spun on his heel to leave, but his steps weren’t as sure as his words. There was a slight hesitation, a flicker of something uncertain in his stride.
Through the ajar door, Sadie heard every word.
She lay curled on the bed, her face ghostly pale, eyes staring into nothingness.
She had long known Noah didn’t care. Her heart, already numb, felt like it was being cut by a knife, yet she felt nothing.
A bitter, self-mocking smile tugged at her lips, as if she were laughing at the foolish hopes she’d once clung to.
Without a word, Jim quietly closed the door, shutting out Noah’s final, wavering glance.
Silence settled over the room, broken only by the soft, shallow rhythm of Sadie’s breathing.
Jim’s footsteps were soft as he approached the bed. His eyes filled with concern as he studied Sadie’s pale, unmoving face. “Are you all right?” he asked gently, his voice low and careful.
Sadie remained silent, lying still as if she were nothing more than a hollow shell, a puppet with its strings cut.
Jim let out a quiet sigh, sitting on the edge of the bed. He reached out to feel her forehead, his touch light. “It’s alright. The fever isn’t too high.”
But then, without warning, Sadie stirred.
She shot up abruptly, her eyes wild, glinting with a desperate, almost frantic light.
Before Jim could react, she seized his hand. Her fingers were ice-cold, but her grip was fierce, unrelenting.
Then, to his utter shock, Sadie slid off the bed and dropped to her knees with a dull thud. 
.

###Chapter 106:noveldrama
“Please.” The word tore from her throat, hoarse and raw, trembling with emotions she had buried for far too long. “Help me.”
Jim’s heart lurched. He quickly reached down, flustered, and helped her back to her feet. “Sadie, what’s wrong?” he asked, his voice urgent but gentle. “What happened? I was told you were just sick.” He held her by the arms, his steady hands trying to calm her.
Sadie fought to keep her tears at bay, her voice trembling as she forced out the words. “Noah has me trapped here… cut off from everyone. I need to get out. Please, can you help me?” Her eyes locked onto Jim’s, her desperation palpable.
Jim froze, the weight of her plea pressing down on him. “Well…” He trailed off, torn between empathy and concern.
He knew all too well how ruthless Noah could be. If Noah ever found out he’d helped Sadie escape, the fallout would be catastrophic. The mere thought of Noah’s wrath sent a trickle of sweat down Jim’s temple.
Sadie saw the hesitation flicker across his face. She inhaled deeply, steadying herself, her voice soft but resolute. “Don’t worry. I won’t drag you into this any more than necessary. Just… distract the guards downstairs. That’s all I need. I’ll take care of the rest.” Her tone was calm, but her eyes burned with fierce determination. She was ready to risk everything.
Jim wavered, the logic gnawing at him.
It wasn’t much—just a simple diversion.
Harmless enough, or so it seemed.
As if sensing his internal struggle, Sadie pressed her advantage. Her trembling hand moved to her abdomen.
“Yesterday…” she whispered, her voice cracking. “Noah carried me back. It… it put the pregnancy at risk.” She swallowed hard, her words thick with emotion. “And today, I’ve been running a fever.”
She lifted her gaze to meet Jim’s, her eyes swimming with a mix of despair and silent pleading.

“If I stay here any longer… I’ll either be forced into an abortion when he finds out about the pregnancy… or I’ll lose the baby from his neglect.”
Her words hung heavy in the air. She squeezed her eyes shut, and the tears she’d fought so hard to hold back finally broke free, trailing down her pale cheeks.
“Either way…” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I can’t keep the baby… For the sake of my child… I have to leave.”
Jim stood frozen, feeling as though two warring voices clashed inside his mind.
One screamed at him to back away, to avoid entanglement in this mess. Noah’s wrath wasn’t just dangerous—it was catastrophic. Getting involved could ruin him.
But the other voice, softer yet more insistent, tugged at his conscience. It was the voice of compassion, of duty, reminding him of why he became a doctor in the first place: to save lives.
His eyes drifted to Sadie—her haunted, pleading gaze, the tear-streaked cheeks, and her trembling hand resting protectively over her abdomen. It felt like something had pierced through his chest, striking the very core of him.
Jim remembered his oath, the promise he’d made to protect life in all its forms, no matter the cost.
The battle within him settled. Compassion outweighed fear.
“Alright, fine,” Jim said, his voice low but unwavering as he gritted his teeth. “I’ll help you.”
Sadie gazed at Jim, her eyes brimming with gratitude, tears gleaming as though she had clung to a lifeline in the midst of a storm.
“I won’t forget this—I’ll pay you back when the time comes,” she stated, her voice thick with emotion, each word laden with raw sincerity. Jim caught the shimmer of genuine thanks in her eyes, feeling an unexpected warmth bloom in his chest.

###Chapter 107:
He shifted his gaze away, an awkward gesture as he cleared his throat. “We don’t have to talk about that yet,” he replied, his voice striving for calm. “How are you feeling right now?”
He paused, a concerned look crossing his face before continuing, “You need to focus on your health first.”
As he spoke, Jim gently began to check Sadie’s condition.
His hands were careful as he listened to her heartbeat and delicately touched her slightly swollen belly. His brow furrowed deeply with concern.
“The fetus is showing signs of distress,” he announced, withdrawing his hand with a grave tone. “If the situation worsens, you might start bleeding, and that could be dangerous.”
At his words, a chill ran through Sadie, her complexion turning ghostly pale.
She gripped the bedsheet tightly, her knuckles whitening, a storm of fear and anxiety swirling in her heart.
Jim observed Sadie’s tense posture, his heart twinging with sympathy. He considered her condition thoughtfully, then offered a gentle suggestion. “It’s a mild fever, nothing too concerning. Put on a cooling patch, and I’ll prescribe something to help with the fever and keep your pregnancy stable. You have to take it,” he advised, his voice calm and reassuring.
He hesitated briefly before adding, “Once you’re feeling better, I’ll help you get out of here safely.”
Sadie paused, absorbing his words, then gave a slow, determined nod. The child growing inside her was her anchor in this vast, uncertain world. She couldn’t risk anything harming her unborn baby.
She needed to forge a secure future for them both, a life far away from Noah’s destructive reach. That meant vanishing completely—no traces left behind.
However, there were things to settle first. She needed to ensure Laura’s well-being and advance the secretive project Roy had promised to orchestrate for her, sidestepping Noah completely.
Step into new worlds with gα?ησν?sоm
Success in these tasks would mean a steady income, crucial for sustaining her and her child’s future.
As Jim began to pack his medical kit, signaling his departure, Sadie felt a surge of urgency.
“Dr. Archer!” she called out, her voice laced with hesitation and quiet desperation.
Jim paused, turning back to face her with an expression of soft concern. “What is it?” he inquired gently.
Sadie chewed on her lower lip, her nerves fluttering. After a torturous pause, she mustered the courage to ask, “Could I… borrow one thousand dollars from you?”
She dipped her head, her gaze anchored to the floor, cheeks tinged with the soft blush of embarrassment. The silence between them stretched, fraught with her anxiety.
She knew her request was bold, given the casual nature of her acquaintance with Jim.noveldrama
But desperation had backed her into this tight corner, and she had nowhere else to turn.
Jim, for his part, seemed genuinely surprised, his eyebrows arching as he processed her unexpected plea.
To him, a thousand dollars was a mere pittance. But for Sadie, at this moment, that money was nothing short of survival.
“Absolutely,” Jim responded, his voice imbued with a warmth that underscored his willingness to help. “But since you can’t leave, what do you need the money for?”
A weary sigh slipped from Sadie’s lips as she cast her eyes downward.
“I need a phone,” she said, her words barely audible.
She wanted to get in touch with Alex. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 108:
Her plan to vanish—disappear without a trace—would stand a better chance with Alex’s help.
With everything hanging in the balance, he was the only one she dared to trust—sharp-minded and always in control.
Jim paused, his brow furrowed in thought as he seemed to grasp her intention.
From the inner pocket of his crisply tailored suit jacket, he pulled out a phone, his slender fingers gliding smoothly over its screen to unlock it. He extended it toward Sadie with a steady hand, his voice even but imbued with quiet resolve.
“Here, take this,” he offered, the corners of his mouth lifting subtly in reassurance.
Sadie’s hand hovered, hesitant, not immediately accepting the device. “This is your phone. Are you sure it’s alright for me to use it?” she murmured, her voice tinged with guilt. “What if someone needs to contact you for work? It might cause you trouble.”
Reluctance flickered across her face, betraying her worry about imposing on Jim or accumulating too many debts of gratitude. As Jim observed her cautious demeanor, his smile widened just a fraction, a spark of warmth in his eyes.
“It’s my personal phone,” he assured her. “Very few people know the number, so you’ll be fine using it.”
He took a thoughtful pause, his gaze locking with hers earnestly. “Besides, if I were to buy you a phone and Noah discovered it, that could lead to unnecessary complications.”
Touched by his considerate words, Sadie felt a warmth spread through her chest.
She finally accepted the phone, her fingers brushing against his as she took it.
“Thank you so much,” she murmured, her gratitude resonating deeply in her quiet, heartfelt expression.
Jim felt a surprising tenderness swell in his heart.
He lingered in the room, observing as Sadie carefully slid his phone into the pocket of her soft pajamas.
Letting out a quiet sigh, he turned on his heel and opened the door. As he walked out of the room, he was caught off guard by the sight of Kyla.
It was clear she had been standing there for a while, her posture tense and suspicious.
Jim’s brows knitted together, a shadow of annoyance crossing his features.
“Were you eavesdropping?” he asked, his voice tinged with cool reproach, his eyes narrowing slightly as they scanned Kyla’s flustered expression.
Taken aback by his piercing stare, Kyla instinctively stepped back, shaking her head vehemently. “No… it’s not like that. I just happened to be passing by,” she stammered, her eyes darting away, betraying her discomfort.
Jim, catching the slight quiver in her voice, let a sardonic smile play across his lips.
“Passing by?” he echoed, his tone dripping with skepticism. “You care about Sadie quite a bit, Miss Wade. If I didn’t know better, I’d say you were sisters.”
Kyla’s cheeks flushed a deep red, the sting of Jim’s sarcasm palpable in the air.
His words mocked her behavior, suggesting she was meddling in matters beyond her concern.
Biting her lip, Kyla clenched her fists at her sides, her nails pressing into her palms as she fought to control her rising irritation.
Despite the anger simmering within, she managed a strained smile. “I’m just making sure she’s alright,” she asserted, striving to sound composed even as her voice betrayed a faint tremble.
Jim dismissed her words with a cold shoulder, striding away decisively. His towering silhouette soon vanished down the long, dimly lit corridor, leaving Kyla frozen in place, her fists clenched and shaking with suppressed fury.
Her eyes, dark with resentment, followed Jim’s fading figure. Taking a deep, shaky breath to calm her mounting anger, she snapped her wrist up, the door to the master bedroom clicking open sharply under her forceful push.

###Chapter 109:
Inside, Sadie was just about to dial Alex’s number when the sudden noise of the door made her start. Her fingers fumbled, and she quickly shoved her phone under the quilt.
As she looked up, her gaze met Kyla’s, who stood framed in the doorway, her expression unreadable yet undeniably stern.
Sensing Sadie’s flustered demeanor, Kyla marched over, her steps echoing with authority.
“What are you hiding?” she demanded, her voice slicing through the tense air, bristling with suspicion. “You’re acting way too suspicious!” She reached forward, her hands grasping at the quilt.
Sadie blanched, her face draining of color as panic flared in her eyes.
The discovery of the phone would shatter her carefully laid plans.
Desperate, she shoved Kyla back, yelling, “Stop acting crazy!”
Her push was gentle, hardly more than a nudge, but Kyla, already weakened by the intense night before, stumbled. Her legs gave way, and she crumpled to the floor, her clothing twisting and bunching up around her limbs.
Sadie’s eyes trailed over the red marks marring her skin—marks left by kisses that were too eager, bites that lingered too long, and touches that were far too rough.
It was an undeniable trace of a night’s untamed heat.
The revelation sent a jolt through her, her breath catching in her throat.
Kyla staggered to her feet, her movements clumsy yet filled with an indignant energy.
“You actually dared to push me?” Her voice cut through the air, laced with sheer disbelief.
When she caught the direction of Sadie’s gaze, her lips twisted into a smug smirk.
Let your imagination soar with g?lnσνs?com
She slowly adjusted her rumpled clothes, her eyes shimmering with unspoken stories of conquest.
“Did you see this?” she asked, drawing out the words with a tantalizing slowness, her voice dripping with provocation. “Noah is always so…”
Kyla trailed off, her eyes darting as she searched for just the right description, finally settling with a flourish. “Passionate,” she declared, the word tinged with a mix of coquettish delight and pride.
Meanwhile, Sadie’s hands balled into fists at her sides, her nails pressing painfully into her palms—yet she felt nothing but a cold numbness.noveldrama
She shut her eyes and inhaled deeply to steady her racing heart. When she opened them again, her expression was serene, almost detached.
Was there a hint of relief in her calm demeanor?
Perhaps there was.
She was relieved that she had fallen out of love with Noah before his darker sides had fully emerged into the light.
How much more devastating would the betrayal have been otherwise?
“If you’re done putting on a show, Miss Wade, then get the hell out.” Sadie’s voice was a serene whisper, eerily devoid of emotion.
Kyla, momentarily stunned by Sadie’s calm, gave her a once-over.
Her eyes paused briefly on the cooling patch adorning Sadie’s forehead.
Was it just a fever, or was there something more?
Skepticism flickered across Kyla’s face.
“Is it just a fever?” she probed, her voice laced with a sliver of concern so subtle it was almost imperceptible.
Sadie’s response was a sneer, sharp and biting.
“Thanks to you, I’m still breathing,” she spat, her voice dripping with venomous sarcasm. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 110:
Kyla’s features flickered with emotion, but she quickly put on a placid smile.
“What are you implying? I haven’t done anything,” she said, her innocence feigned, her eyelashes batting as if to ward off suspicion.
Exhausted by the pretense, Sadie snapped, “Get the fuck out!” Her finger jabbed toward the door, her tone icy enough to chill the air between them.
Kyla’s lips tightened, a glimmer of spite flashing in her eyes.
Yet, she held back her words, turning sharply to exit the room, leaving the tension thick in her wake.noveldrama
Kyla strode out of the master bedroom, her intuition screaming that something was amiss.
There was no way Sadie and Jim didn’t have something hidden between them.
Their hushed conversation made it clear—they didn’t want her to hear a word of it.
Leaning against the wall in the dimly lit hallway, she stared at the closed door of Sadie’s room, her resolve hardening.
She was determined to bring their scheme to light.
As minutes morphed into what felt like hours, her patience frayed at the edges.
The fact that Sadie hadn’t stepped out of her room yet only made her suspicions grow stronger.
“Playing the innocent, are we?” Kyla scoffed softly, her voice a whisper of venom. She was now certain; the duo was hiding something significant.
She was no longer willing to stand idly by, a dark plan beginning to crystallize in her mind.
Pulling out her phone with a determined flick of her wrist, she dialed Isabel’s number.
“Hello, Mrs. Wall! It’s been quite some time since we last spoke. Tell me, how have you been?” Kyla’s tone was dripping with feigned sweetness.

“Oh, Kyla! It’s been a while. I’m doing just fine. What about you?” Isabel’s voice carried a genuine warmth.
“I’m fantastic, Mrs. Wall. Actually, a friend of mine just returned with some lovely souvenirs from overseas, and I immediately thought of you. I’d love to bring them over to you,” Kyla said, her words coated in the thoughtful politeness one used with an elder.
“That’s incredibly kind of you, Kyla,” Isabel responded, her voice tinged with eager anticipation.
“It’s truly my pleasure, Mrs. Wall. Are you available sometime soon?” Kyla probed, her tone light yet deliberate, weaving her plan with practiced ease.
“I’m free anytime, dear.”
“Perfect! I was actually planning to make dinner for Noah tonight. Why not join us? It’s been ages since we all caught up, and I’ve missed you terribly,” Kyla continued, strategically. Dropping Noah’s name, Kyla knew well that Isabel’s affection for him would make this an offer she couldn’t refuse.
Just as she anticipated, Isabel answered without hesitation, “That sounds wonderful, dear. I haven’t seen my son in what feels like forever. I’ll make my way over soon.”
“That’s wonderful, Mrs. Wall. I’ll be waiting for you at Myrtlewood Estate.” A subtle, victorious smirk danced across Kyla’s lips, her eyes gleaming with scheming delight.
She hung up the phone with a sneer that barely touched her features, betraying her sense of imminent triumph.
“Sadie, just wait. I’ll enjoy watching you fall,” she muttered under her breath.
She pivoted slowly, her gaze drifting scornfully toward the master bedroom.
Sadie could try all she wanted, but at the end of the day, she was just a fool playing chess with a grandmaster. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 111:
It was only a matter of time before Sadie was forced out, banished from Myrtlewood Estate, disowned by the Wall family, and wiped from Noah’s world.
Inhaling deeply to contain her bubbling glee, Kyla set her plan into motion.
She strode purposefully to the kitchen, her movements graceful and precise as she tied an apron around her waist, the picture of a perfect homemaker.
Though the actual cooking was left to the servants, she flitted about with authoritative ease, issuing commands with the poise of a seasoned chef—adjusting a seasoning here, lessening the sugar there.
Every so often, she’d pick up a spoon and stir a pot aimlessly, her facade as the doting wife flawlessly painted, imagining herself preparing a loving meal for her husband.
The sound of the entrance door alerted her to a new arrival.
Her heart skipped in anticipation—Isabel had arrived.
Setting down the spoon, Kyla rushed to the entrance with eager steps. “Mrs. Wall, you’ve arrived!” Kyla exclaimed, her face lighting up with feigned joy and hospitality.
Isabel looked on with a gentle smile, eyes brimming with apparent admiration.
“Kyla, you’re such a sweet girl. Are you really cooking all by yourself?” Isabel’s eyes brightened at the sight of the apron on Kyla.
With a voice brimming with warmth, she insisted, “Don’t fuss over that, dear. Let the kitchen staff take care of it. Why don’t you come and sit with me for a while?”
“Of course, Mrs. Wall,” Kyla responded with a respectful nod. She carefully hung the apron on the back of a nearby chair before turning to address a servant lingering by the doorway.
“Kari, would you please inform Sadie that we have a distinguished guest awaiting her presence downstairs?” she instructed with polite firmness.
“Right away, Miss Wade,” Kari Lewis, the servant, replied as she headed upstairs without hesitation.

With a soft smile, Kyla turned back, slipping her arm through Isabel’s and guiding her smoothly to the sofa.
“Mrs. Wall, how have you been these days?” she inquired with concern.
“I’ve been doing just fine,” Isabel answered, her smile soft as she gave Kyla’s hand a reassuring pat.
“And how about you? How have things been with Noah?” she probed, her casual tone belying the keen sharpness in her gaze.
“Very well, Mrs. Wall,” Kyla murmured, her head bowed in modesty while a faint smile danced on her lips. “Noah has been wonderful to me.”
She hesitated, her voice faltering slightly before she continued, “It’s just that he’s been swamped with work and seldom finds time for us.” Her tone wavered with a soft complaint, drawing Isabel’s empathetic concern.
“That boy never stops working, does he?” Isabel lamented, her head gently swaying in disapproval.
“Once he returns, I’ll make sure to speak to him about this.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Wall,” Kyla responded, her voice thick with emotion, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.
“I do understand, though. He has an enormous burden, keeping everything in a business this big running smoothly,” she explained with a forgiving smile. “I’m just grateful to stand by him through it all.”
“Kyla, you really are such a kind-hearted girl,” Isabel declared, visibly touched as she clasped Kyla’s hands in her own. “No need to worry—I’ll take care of everything to get you and Noah married soon.”
At Isabel’s promise, a wave of elation swept through Kyla, though she composed herself with demure grace.

###Chapter 112:
“Thank you, Mrs. Wall. Noah’s happiness is my greatest concern,” she stated firmly, her gaze dropping modestly while a soft glow of joy illuminated her expression.
The two women exchanged lighthearted words and laughter, their voices occasionally mingling in a melody that filled the room with a comforting, welcoming aura.
Meanwhile, Sadie reclined on her bed, enveloped in the solitude of her room.
The distant hum of conversation floated up from below, but she didn’t bother to listen.
Isabel had never been fond of her, and having her around now would only make Sadie feel even more uneasy.
With a weary sigh, she closed her eyes, seeking refuge in the fleeting escape of sleep.
However, the serenity was abruptly pierced by a sharp knock at the door.
“Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall’s mother is here. Please come downstairs.”
The servant spoke politely at the doorway.
Sadie hesitated, yearning for nothing more than solitude.
She began to shut the door to escape the social obligations waiting outside. But the conversations drifting up from below paused her movements.
“Kyla, have you noticed an increase in your weight? Could it possibly mean…?” Isabel’s tone was filled with curious expectation.
“Really, Isabel? Do you think I appear heavier?” Kyla responded, her voice tinged with shy happiness.
Sadness washed over Sadie abruptly.
Her hand instinctively moved to her abdomen.

“Both you and Noah aren’t getting younger. It’s time to consider settling down.” Isabel’s voice echoed once more, decisive and clear.
“I’ll let Noah decide,” responded Kyla, her voice both soft and determined.
Color drained from Sadie’s face.
Breathing became a laborious task for her.
She mused over the irony—her existence and that of her child seemed like some harsh jest, overlooked by all.
Sadie forcefully closed the door, cutting off the sounds of laughter and conversation rising from below.
Resting her back against the wood, she gradually slid down to the carpeted floor.
Her hands wrapped around her abdomen, fingers quivering slightly. Within her, a new life was taking shape, its future as precarious as hers.
Inhaling sharply, she fought to control the tears threatening to spill. Her hands shook as she pulled her phone from her pocket and dialed Alex.
“Hello?” Alex answered, his voice tinged with surprise and concern.
“Sadie? Is that you? Is everything okay?”
There was a mix of worry and restrained joy in his tone.
“Has Noah been giving you a hard time? I’ve been trying to reach you for days.”
Sadie struggled to hold back her emotions, her voice breaking. “Alex, I need your help. I’m thinking of leaving the country.”
Alex was shocked and responded, “Leaving the country? Can you tell me what’s going on?”
With her eyes shut tightly, Sadie took another deep breath, trying to steady her overwhelming feelings.
She said, “I feel trapped. He monitors my every move. It feels like I’m suffocating here.”
She hesitated before adding, “I won’t forget this help you’ve given me. And regarding my secret dealings with Mr. Dominguez—I must step back from it. Please handle it yourself. I expect no gains from it.” noveldrama

###Chapter 113:
The line went quiet.
Then, after a considerable delay, Alex’s response came, subdued and slow. “Are you certain about your decision?”
With unwavering resolve, Sadie replied, “Absolutely.”
A resigned sigh came from Alex. “What should I do next?”
There was a momentary pause as Sadie contemplated, her expression tense. “I’m currently at Myrtlewood Estate. Could you arrange for someone to fetch me this evening? I plan to escape through the window.”
“Please, think this through carefully!” Alex urged, concern evident in his voice.
“It’s just the second floor; the fall won’t be fatal,” Sadie replied with determination. “I need to get out of here to build a better future for me and my child.”
Kyla lingered at the doorway, her face betraying no emotion.
Her initial plan had been to bring Sadie downstairs to unsettle her and witness her discomfort.
But she ended up overhearing Sadie’s conversation about leaving the country.
A chill of satisfaction spread across Kyla’s face.
This was indeed welcome news.
Naturally, she thought to herself, she would “assist” Sadie in her plans. Without making a sound at the door, Kyla quietly walked away, her lips curled into a cold smile.
Soon after, Noah arrived back at Myrtlewood Estate.
His brow furrowed when he noticed Isabel’s presence.
From the kitchen, Kyla emerged bearing dishes, her smile bright as she invited Noah to dine.

“Dinner is served, Noah,” Kyla called out, her voice calm and gentle, masking any underlying issues.
Noah’s eyes shifted towards the staircase. “Why isn’t she coming downstairs?”
Isabel’s eyebrow arched, her voice laced with annoyance. “Why is that woman still around? Weren’t you going to divorce her?”
Kyla attempted to diffuse the tension. “Sadie seems unwell today. I’ll check on her.”
“No need,” Noah said.
He ascended the stairs himself.
Adjusting his tie, he approached Sadie’s room, finding the door locked to his surprise.
Frustration welled up inside him.
Noah knocked on the door, a note of impatience in his voice. “Sadie, open up.”
Sadie’s heart sank. She swiftly concealed her phone, inhaled sharply, and opened the door.
As she faced Noah, her expression was cold. “Do you need something?” she spoke with a detached tone, as though addressing someone she barely knew.
Noah’s irritation mounted at Sadie’s aloof demeanor.
“Join us for dinner,” he demanded, his tone unyielding.
Sadie let out a soft scoff, her gaze mocking. “I’d rather not interrupt your family meal.”
She paused, her stomach churning, and revulsion threatened to break through her composure.
“Frankly, being around you all is nauseating,” she continued.
Noah’s expression hardened.
This was a new, bitter sharpness in Sadie’s voice that he hadn’t encountered before.noveldrama
Could Kyla have said something she shouldn’t have to his mother? Noah was about to inquire when the door slammed shut abruptly, cutting off any opportunity for him to speak. The click of the lock echoed, firm and decisive.

###Chapter 114:
Noah stood outside the door, his expression dark and foreboding. Inside, Sadie pressed her back against the door, gradually sinking to the floor.noveldrama
She couldn’t bear the sight of Noah anymore.
She resolved to shut out his words from now on.
Tonight, Sadie was determined to escape through the window.
She anticipated the moment eagerly.
Her careful watching had revealed a security lapse around nine o’clock each evening during the guard shift change.
It was an ideal opportunity.
Inhaling deeply, Sadie sought to steady her nerves.
She rose, approached the window, and quietly opened it slightly to survey the scene below.
Meanwhile, Noah made his way to the dining room.
The air was tense as Isabel and Kyla sat at the table, their faces strained.
Isabel set down her utensils sharply as Noah approached, her tone laced with criticism. “Noah, if you’re divorcing, it’s time that troublemaker left. Why keep her around?”
Her words cut through the air, tinged with resentment.
Noah’s expression tightened, his impatience evident.
“Mind your own affairs,” he retorted coldly, his voice carrying a warning edge.
Isabel bristled at her son’s rebuff, her displeasure growing.
“So, when are you planning to get engaged to Kyla?” she asked, turning expectantly to Kyla.
Noah’s face immediately took on a sterner look, his eyes narrowing as he faced Isabel.
Your story hub is g?lnσνs?
“When did I ever say I was going to get engaged to her?”
Kyla, perceiving the escalating tension, stepped in with a reassuring smile. “Mrs. Wall, Noah just needs a little more time. We should pace ourselves.”
Her tone was gentle, aiming to calm the charged room.
Facing continuous rebuffs from her son, Isabel turned livid with anger, and she couldn’t contain her frustration any longer. “I’m done with both of you!”
She rose sharply and exited the dining room in haste, leaving Noah and Kyla behind in a tense and awkward silence.
Kyla extended a delicate hand to lightly grasp Noah’s sleeve, her touch grazing his wrist.
Tears rimmed her eyes as she spoke in a tender voice, displaying a touching vulnerability. “Noah, Mrs. Wall was just showing her care for you. Please don’t take her words to heart. We don’t have to rush this, okay?”
Her eyes met Noah’s, filled with earnest emotion, pleading silently.
Noah quietly pulled his arm away, irritation flickering in his glance. “I have no appetite,” he responded tersely, then turned and walked toward the stairs.
Kyla’s gaze lingered on his departing back, a flicker of reluctance in her eyes that she swiftly concealed.
She quickened her pace to catch up, her smile seamlessly returning. “Since you’re not hungry, how about we try that new restaurant downtown? They serve excellent dishes.”
She paused briefly, proposing with apparent nonchalance, “Why don’t we ask Sadie to join us? She hardly touched her lunch; she must be hungry.”
Behind her friendly facade, Kyla was plotting. She needed to keep Sadie from slipping away through the window.

###Chapter 115:
She had already set the hacker on standby, just waiting for the right moment to deal with Sadie.
Her plans were too important to be abandoned now.
Noah paused, her suggestion catching his attention as he furrowed his brows slightly.
“Why wasn’t she eating?” he asked, his voice tinged with both curiosity and a subtle concern that was almost unnoticeable.
“Perhaps she finds the food at home too bland. I’ve read that people who aren’t feeling well sometimes prefer stronger flavors,” Kyla explained, her voice infused with a hint of concern that suggested genuine care for Sadie’s well-being.
Gracefully, she moved toward the staircase.
“I’ll go see how Sadie is doing.” Casually throwing the remark behind her, Kyla ascended the stairs, leaving Noah to ponder alone.
Internally, Kyla grinned. She was eager to see how Sadie would try to get away this time.
Arriving at Sadie’s door, she confidently raised her hand and knocked decisively.
“Knock. Knock. Knock.”
Her knocking was persistent and forceful.
“Sadie? Sadie!” she called, her voice growing louder and infused with urgency as she knocked.
In her room, Sadie scowled with irritation. What was Kyla planning this time?
As Kyla’s knocks echoed, Sadie’s stress escalated.
“Knock. Knock. Knock.”
The knocks intensified, echoing louder through the room.
gα?ησν?s． brings magic to life
Unable to bear the incessant knocking, Sadie quickly stood, marched to the door, and flung it open.
“What is it you want?”
Her tone was cold, her stare piercing, as though she could see right through Kyla.
Taken aback by Sadie’s vehement reaction, Kyla momentarily stepped backward.
However, she swiftly regained her composure, her smile returning.
“Sadie, are you alright? Why were you taking so long to answer?” Kyla’s voice was laced with concern, her eyes twinkling with a hint of smug satisfaction.
Sadie responded with a cold glare, remaining silent.
At that moment, Noah appeared.
He caught sight of Sadie by the door, her expression tense and her eyes steely, which deepened his concern.
“What’s happening here?” he inquired, stepping closer to Sadie with evident worry.
Ignoring Noah, Sadie directed her cold tone at Kyla, asking, “What is it that you really want?”
Kyla maintained a feigned look of concern. “I’m just concerned about you, Sadie. You skipped lunch, and I thought I’d check on you.” She added, “Mrs. Wall suggested that those feeling unwell might prefer spicier, more acidic foods to stimulate their appetite, given the blandness of our meals.”
Noah’s expression darkened slightly. He firmly said to Sadie, “Go and eat.”
He reached for her arm, intending to guide her downstairs.
Sadie swiftly pulled her arm away and responded coldly, “I’m not going.”
Noah lost his temper, his demeanor turning cold as he picked Sadie up in his arms and decisively carried her downstairs.
“Let me go!” Sadie fought back with all her might. noveldrama

###Chapter 116:
“Are you out of your mind?” Her eyes bore into Noah, filled with both anger and fear.
Noah paid no attention to her protests, carrying her effortlessly and heading straight for the dining table. He placed her onto a chair with a firm but controlled motion.
His stare was cold as he looked down at her.
“Is this some kind of threat, refusing to eat or drink?”
Sadie was baffled by his actions. She had no desire to argue or engage with him; she only wanted to escape this oppressive environment as soon as possible.
Her eyes quickly swept to the wall clock—it read eight-thirty. The guards at the gate would switch shifts at nine o’clock, which was her window for escape, coordinated with Alex’s arrival.
Noah took the seat opposite Sadie, his expression as cold as ever. “You won’t leave this table until you’ve eaten,” he said, his voice leaving no room for negotiation.
Kyla observed the escalating tension with growing annoyance.
She had intended to thwart Sadie’s plan to flee, not anticipating that Noah would care so much about Sadie.
He even got furious just because she had skipped a meal.
A sharp pang of jealousy hit Kyla, feeling excluded and unnoticed.
Sadie clenched her jaw, silently working out her next move. Her only thought was to get out.
Despite her lack of hunger, Sadie feigned cooperation to minimize conflict with Noah.
She reached for the serving spoon, selected a piece of fish steak, placed it on her plate, and began eating without any real interest.
The flavor of the sauce coated her tongue, yet it failed to appeal to her taste buds.

As she chewed without enjoyment, her gaze flicked towards the clock intermittently.
With each passing minute, her tension mounted.
Once Noah observed Sadie consuming a few bites, he seemed to relax somewhat.
He filled a glass with water and set it next to Sadie’s hand.
A spark of inspiration flashed in Sadie’s eyes.
She feigned a casual gesture and accidentally knocked the glass over.
Water cascaded out, saturating Noah’s suit with a spreading dark patch.
“Argh! Are you alright, Noah? Did that scald you?” Kyla sprang into action, pulling out paper towels and hastily trying to dry Noah’s suit, her expression etched with worry.
Her voice thick with disapproval, she scolded, “Sadie, how could you be so clumsy?”
Sadie dismissed Kyla’s criticism, ignoring her completely, and continued with her meal as though the incident hadn’t occurred.
A scowl formed on Noah’s face, and he uttered a grunt of irritation before standing.noveldrama
“I need to go change,” he said, his voice filled with cold fury.
Immediately, Sadie placed her fork down.
With determination, she got up, planning to shut herself in the bedroom and bar Noah from entering.
But as she took her first step, Kyla’s sharp voice stopped her cold. “Where do you think you’re heading, Sadie?” Kyla’s words were tinged with sarcasm.
Caught off guard, Sadie stopped and turned around in surprise to face Kyla.
“Trying to make a getaway through the window?” Kyla sneered, her voice full of contempt.
A wave of cold fear washed over Sadie.
Kyla’s correct guess about her escape plan unnerved her.
Sadie’s complexion drained of color. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 117:
Observing Sadie’s distressed look brought a twisted sense of gratification to Kyla.
She moved closer to Sadie, towering over her with a mocking smirk.
“Really, Sadie, such a clumsy attempt. Jumping out of a window? Do you honestly think you’ll manage to flee? Even if you manage the jump, escaping isn’t certain.”
Kyla paused for a moment, her eyes flashing with spite.
“Imagine if I inform Noah that you deliberately spilled water on him as a distraction to help your escape…”
Kyla left the threat hanging, confident that her words had hit their mark.
Sadie inhaled sharply.
“What are you trying to imply?”
Kyla gave a dismissive shake of her head and exhaled, pitying Sadie as if she were a lost cause.
Kyla’s eyes narrowed as she looked at Sadie. “You’re really unbelievable. Did you honestly think such a reckless plan would work? You think you can just waltz in and out of this villa whenever you please?” She paused for a moment, her expression softening ever so slightly. “But… I can offer you help, if you agree to my terms.”
Sadie was taken aback. She stared at Kyla, suspicion written across her face. “Help me? Why would you?” Her mind raced, trying to make sense of it. Still, she couldn’t fathom what other connection could exist between her and Kyla besides the animosity that had always been present.
Kyla’s lips curled into a knowing smile, her gaze calculating. “It’s simple, really,” she said. “I want to marry Noah. And you’re standing in my way. If you vanish and promise never to appear in front of him again, I’ll help you.”
Sadie’s heart dropped, a heavy weight settling in her chest. Her mind raced, her eyes flickering with doubt and conflict. She didn’t trust Kyla. Not for a moment. Kyla was cunning, manipulative, and always scheming. What was she really after?
Sadie bit down hard on her lower lip, silence filling the space between them. She didn’t respond immediately, unsure how to handle the situation.

Kyla didn’t push further. Instead, she leaned back, observing Sadie intently, a knowing smile tugging at the corners of her lips. Her voice was smooth, but there was an unmistakable edge to it. “You can think it over,” she said, her tone laced with subtle warning. “But don’t even think about trying to escape through the window. Even if you try, you won’t get away.”
Just as the tension thickened, Noah returned, freshly changed.
Kyla immediately took two steps back, her demeanor shifting instantly. The sharp, calculating woman from moments ago was gone, replaced by someone calm and composed. She wore a gentle smile as if nothing had happened.
Sadie’s eyes flickered to Noah as he approached her. There was a faint look of confusion on his face. “What are you zoning out for?” he asked, his voice deep and smooth, laced with a subtle hint of concern. “Did you spill the water on purpose?” His tone was light, almost teasing, as though he were merely making casual conversation.
Sadie scoffed quietly, a bitter laugh escaping her. “Yes, I did it on purpose,” she said, her voice sharp. The anger she’d been holding back was now bubbling to the surface.
Sadie turned her eyes away, her voice growing cold. “The meal’s finished. Can I go back and rest now?”noveldrama
Noah’s gaze shifted to the small stain of soup at the corner of her lips, his brow furrowing in slight concern. Instinctively, he reached out to wipe it away.
But Sadie quickly stepped back, a firm expression crossing her face. “It’s fine,” she said, her tone dismissive as she avoided Noah’s touch.
Without another word, Sadie turned and left the dining room, her steps quick and deliberate. She didn’t look back as she walked straight to her bedroom and locked the door behind her.
Sadie walked to the window, staring out at the sprawling grounds of Myrtlewood Estate—Noah’s world. Kyla’s words replayed in her mind, taunting her. 
.

###Chapter 118:
A bitter laugh escaped Sadie’s lips. “I can’t escape,” she murmured, her chest heavy. This was Noah’s domain, surrounded by his people. She might never get another chance if anyone found her trying to leave.
Sadie pulled out her phone, the light from the screen casting an eerie glow on her pale face. Her fingers trembled as the seconds ticked by, each moment pressing harder on her chest. Time was running out.
Taking a steadying breath, Sadie dialed Alex’s number.
“Hello?” Alex’s voice sounded puzzled. He was confused by the sudden call.
“It’s me,” Sadie replied, her voice low and hoarse, as though every word required immense effort.
“Sadie? What’s wrong?” Alex’s tone shifted instantly as he picked up on the unease in her voice. He sounded anxious, almost alarmed.
“The plan’s canceled,” Sadie said, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath to steady her trembling voice. “Kyla found out. She won’t let me leave.”
“What?!” Alex’s voice rose sharply. “How did she find out?”
“I don’t know,” Sadie admitted, her voice heavy with frustration. “This plan was too risky. I never agreed to it,” Alex said, his words sharp with regret.
“I didn’t have a choice!” Sadie replied, bitterness crawling up her throat. “There was nothing else I could do.”
“You need to get out of Myrtlewood Estate, somewhere public, somewhere crowded,” Alex advised, his voice calm but urgent. “A mall, a big event, anywhere you can disappear into a crowd.”
“I’ll figure it out,” Sadie murmured, her tone resigned.
Sadie ended the call without another word, tossing the phone onto the bed in frustration. Helplessness clawed at her chest.
Downstairs, Noah sat on the sofa, his expression dark and unreadable. Kyla approached with a sweet smile, settling beside Noah and curling close to him. Her voice dripped with sweetness as she said, “Noah, the Maple Group CEO’s wedding anniversary party is the day after tomorrow. Why don’t we go together?”
mr ρdaes ? anovels.cm
Noah frowned, a flicker of impatience crossing his face. He gently pushed her hand away. “No. I have other plans.”
Kyla’s lips formed a small pout, her tone turning playfully whiny. “But it’s so boring here. A party would be so much more fun.”
Kyla paused momentarily, then, as if a thought had just crossed her mind, added, “By the way, I heard Sadie has worked with Maple Group before. She should probably go too. Otherwise, she’ll just stay locked in her room and get sick.”
Noah’s gaze shifted to Kyla, his expression sharpening with suspicion. He studied her briefly before asking, his voice low, “Since when did you start caring about her?”
Though Kyla was shaken, she maintained her composure and offered a strained smile.
“It would be best if we went together. I’d prefer you not to bring anyone else. After all, your divorce is imminent.”
Noah averted his eyes and responded flatly, “We can discuss that.” He got up and headed directly to the study, leaving Kyla by the sofa.
When the door to the study clicked shut, the forced smile disappeared from Kyla’s face, giving way to a chilling, calculating look.
She checked the clock; it was almost nine.noveldrama
Rising, she made her way to the courtyard and gazed up at the lit window of Sadie’s room on the second floor, her expression a mix of emotions.
The light in the room was on, the window ajar, yet Sadie was out of sight.
Kyla’s sneer emerged. Clearly, Sadie had abandoned her naive scheme. As the guards changed shifts, Kyla covertly took out her phone and dialed a secured number.
“Hello, it’s me,” she whispered, her voice laced with subtle tension. “At the Maple Group CEO’s wedding celebration in two days, it’s time to act.”

###Chapter 119:
She paused, her voice hardening. “You must not fail this time. I’ll text you the details later. If plans change, I’ll update you.”noveldrama
Laughter tinged with sarcasm answered her from the other end. “Ah, Miss Wade, surely you won’t make me wait again?”
Kyla’s irritation flared.
“Just execute it flawlessly. Don’t botch it like last time,” she said, anger evident in her tone. “Make sure she dies this time.”
“Make sure she dies?” the hacker repeated with a playful tone, amused by Kyla’s intensity. “Wow, when a woman gets fierce, it’s truly terrifying.”
“Stop the nonsense!” Kyla exclaimed with a hint of impatience. “Finish the job, and your reward will follow.”
“Okay, fine. You always keep it simple, Miss Wade. It’s refreshing to work with you!” the hacker responded playfully, chuckling before disconnecting.
Kyla inhaled deeply, attempting to settle her nerves.
Raising her eyes once more, Kyla locked eyes with Sadie by the window of her room.
With a chill in her smile and a casual wave, Kyla greeted her. In two days, Sadie would meet her end; she should savor these final days.
Meanwhile, in his study, Noah was engrossed in paperwork, his brow furrowed in concentration.
The piercing sound of his ringtone shattered the silence.
He picked up, his expression growing stern as he listened. “What’s that? Any leads?”
The informant on the line updated him about the ongoing probe into Sadie’s car accident.
The prime suspect was a hacker known as Ryder Clifford, infamous for his elusive nature.
Lɑt?st chαpt?rs in glov?ls.?m
Although the police had pinpointed his last known location, they found it deserted, suggesting he might be using multiple hideouts.
Luckily, they managed to secure surveillance footage and extracted several images, which they forwarded to Noah.
As Noah scanned the blurry images on his screen, his gaze became more discerning.
He stared at the familiar eyes in the photos, sparking doubt.
Despite a mask and hat obscuring most of his features, something about the eyes struck him as familiar.
Zooming in on the images, he scrutinized them until he noticed one in which Ryder was in an embrace with a woman.
The photo’s angle obscured her face, but her fashion sense, particularly her choice of designer wear, was unmistakably similar to Kyla’s usual style.
Could Kyla have orchestrated that car accident?
A chill of dread crept through Noah, his heart heavy with suspicion.
He wasted no time contacting Samuel. “Continue the investigation. I want a detailed report on Ryder, especially his recent contacts.” His tone was icy, leaving no room for argument.
The Myrtlewood Estate was brightly lit.
All three occupants were lost in their thoughts.
By the next morning, Jim made an unexpected appearance.
He marched into the living room, his gaze quickly settling on Kyla, who sat with poised grace on the sofa. His eyes narrowed. “Where’s Sadie?” he asked, his tone casual yet tinged with concern.
“She’s taking a rest upstairs,” Noah responded from behind, his voice carrying a cool undertone.
Jim stopped, turned to Noah, and held his gaze for a moment. Then, pretending not to care, he said, “I’ll go check on her.”

###Chapter 120:noveldrama
Noah stepped into his path. “What’s this sudden interest in Sadie? Are you keeping secrets from me?”
Jim avoided a direct response. His eyes flicked to Kyla, still seated, and with a knowing glance, he challenged, “How long will you keep up this charade? Is it really amusing to have all three of you under one roof here at Myrtlewood Estate?”
Noah’s expression tightened. “Stay out of my affairs.”
With a casual shrug, Jim remarked, “It hardly matters to me.” He then moved past Noah and made his way upstairs, leaving Noah brooding silently in the living room.
Jim knocked softly on the bedroom door, the sound barely audible.
“Come in.” Sadie’s response came from inside, her voice raspy and weak.
As Jim eased the door open, he caught sight of Sadie perched on the edge of the bed, her face slightly drained of color.
“What happened last night? Why did you cancel the plan?” Jim approached her, his voice laced with concern, his brow creased with a trace of puzzlement.
“It was too risky to go through with,” Sadie murmured, shaking her head as a wave of exhaustion seemed to wash over her. “I can’t afford to complicate things further.”
Her gaze lifted, eyes steeling with resolve. “I need to figure out a way to step out in the next few days.”
“Step out?” Jim frowned slightly. “Where do you plan to go?”
“Anywhere but here,” Sadie stated, her voice quivering as she gripped the blanket, her knuckles blanching.
“There’s no way Noah’s letting you step out alone,” Jim pointed out.
“I know,” Sadie sighed deeply, her expression fraught with determination. “That’s why I need you. Could you possibly speak with Noah?”
She gazed at Jim, desperation flickering in her eyes. “Tell him I’ve got work to handle, and if the business partners can’t get a hold of me, they’ll start getting suspicious.”

Jim held her gaze, a silent moment passing between them before he nodded, his expression solemn. “I’ll do what I can,” he assured her.
“Thanks, Jim,” Sadie said, her voice threaded with gratitude as a warm smile brightened her face.
“Don’t stress yourself out over it,” Jim replied, his voice mellowing as he locked eyes with her. “I’ll do my best to help you.”
He hesitated, his concern evident as he continued, “Just make sure you’re eating well and resting enough. It’s not just about you anymore; the baby needs it too.”
“I know, I know,” Sadie murmured, her gaze drifting away thoughtfully.
Jim’s expression was a complex tapestry of emotions as he watched her, wanting to say more but ultimately holding back.
With quiet resolve, he turned and left the room, gently closing the door behind him before making his way downstairs.
Noah was still there, framed against the vast floor-to-ceiling window in the living room, lost in thought.
As Jim’s footsteps echoed softly, Noah turned, his gaze intense and laden with unspoken words.
“What were you and Sadie discussing?” he asked, his voice a low rumble.
“Nothing,” Jim answered, stopping to face him, his posture tense.
“But you were in there for a long time,” Noah pressed, skepticism sharpening his tone.
“Just some stuff about her health,” Jim replied, shifting uncomfortably. “Sadie’s… she’s not doing great.”
He took a deep breath, steeling himself before adding, “Noah, this isn’t working. You can’t keep going on like this.”
Noah’s frown deepened, a shadow falling over his features. 
.

.
###Chapter 121:
“The way things are between you two—it’s helping no one,” Jim continued, his voice firm with conviction. “If you’re set on divorcing, why delay it?”
Noah’s voice was thick with scorn as he sneered dismissively. “Divorce? Who said we’re getting a divorce?”
He took a step closer, his piercing gaze locked on Jim. “Do you have some kind of crush on her?”
Jim bristled, his tone heated as he shot back, “What bullshit are you spewing now? As someone not directly involved, I have to say this seems really unfair to her.”
“Unfair?” Noah echoed, dripping with sarcasm. “Look, our issues are none of your concern.”
“I was merely trying to—” Jim began, but Noah cut him off with an icy sharpness that left no room for argument.
“You don’t have to come to Myrtlewood Estate anymore—consider this your last visit.”
His words hung heavily in the air as he turned sharply and ascended the stairs, leaving Jim frozen in place, a storm brewing across his features.
Watching Noah’s determined departure, Jim felt a crushing wave of defeat.
He pulled out his phone with a shaky hand and typed a message to Sadie. “I did everything I could.”
After confirming the message was sent, he pocketed his phone and walked away from Myrtlewood Estate, each step heavy with resignation.
On her end, Sadie stared at the glowing text on her screen, a wave of desolation washing over her.
Uncertain of her next move, she was jolted from her thoughts by a sudden knock at the door.
Panic flickered across her face as she stashed her phone away, composing herself before answering.
Opening the door, she found Noah filling the doorway, his imposing figure casting a long shadow. His voice was emotionless, almost mechanical. “Are you already bored of staying at Myrtlewood Estate?”
A bitter chuckle escaped Sadie’s lips, sorrow lingering in her heart. “Bored? Mr. Wall, is that really what you think being trapped here feels like?”
“Noah Wall, I’m a living person, not your caged pet,” Sadie said, her voice tight with anger. “What gives you the right to take away my freedom?”
Noah’s eyes narrowed, taking in her defiance with a cold, calculating look.
“Answer my question,” he responded, his tone heavy and demanding.
In her mind, Sadie clung to a sliver of hope for freedom from her confinement.
“I absolutely want out!” she replied boldly, challenging him. “So, Mr. Wall, will you set me free?”
“Tomorrow marks the Maple Group CEO’s wedding anniversary celebration,” Noah said. “As Mrs. Wall, your role is to support me as my wife.”
A spark of resolve flashed in Sadie’s eyes.
“Fine,” she responded swiftly, her voice tinged with urgency.
Noah studied her for a moment longer before exiting the room. As his silhouette vanished through the door, Sadie exhaled deeply, her shoulders dropping as the tension eased.
She moved to the window, looking out at the sky, her emotions swirling.
Just then, Kyla approached with a sly grin.
“It was I who proposed the idea of letting you attend the anniversary party to Noah,” she said, her voice laced with pride. “So, you should thank me.”noveldrama
Suspicion clouded Sadie’s eyes, a tremor of unease stirring within her. “What do you want?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 122:
Kyla fixed her with a stern look. “I’ve made myself clear. Stay away from Noah,” she said, her voice sharp. “If you don’t, I’ll sabotage your plan.”
A chill ran through Sadie as she realized Kyla meant what she said. She clenched her jaw tightly. “I’m going to leave the country, and get as far away as possible.”
A triumphant smile played on Kyla’s lips. “That’s excellent.”
Once Kyla left, Sadie inhaled deeply, struggling to calm the storm of feelings within her, and picked up the phone to call Alex.
“Alex, could you book a plane ticket for me? I need to depart after the Maple Group CEO’s wedding anniversary event tomorrow night,” she said with forced calmness, though her voice quivered slightly.
“The anniversary event? When does it start, and where is it happening?” Alex asked.
“It’s set for eight in the evening at the Pearl Hotel,” Sadie responded quickly, thinking about her escape plan.
“Understood. I’ll take care of it. Stay safe,” Alex replied, concern evident in his voice.
“I will,” Sadie answered, hanging up the phone with a sense of reassurance. She now had a way out.
The next day, Noah came back from work sooner than usual. A housemaid ascended the stairs to inform Sadie that she was needed downstairs.
Sadie didn’t refuse. She felt eerily calm.
With each moment closer to her departure, she became more composed.
As she descended the stairs slowly, her steps were light yet resolute. In the living room, Noah was perched on the sofa, a document in hand, and a look of weariness etched on his face.
On the dining table lay two beautifully wrapped gift boxes, their lavish packaging screaming luxury.

As she approached the table, Sadie’s eyes landed on the gift boxes, her mind clouded with confusion.noveldrama
“What are these?” she inquired gently, her voice laced with curiosity.
Noah raised his eyes, his expression a complex tapestry of emotions, difficult to read.
“They are a dress and shoes for you,” he explained, his voice steady. “Put them on later.” He paused before continuing, “You mustn’t bring shame upon the Wall family.”
Without a word of protest, Sadie lifted the gift boxes and began ascending the stairs.
From below, Noah observed her lithe form vanish around the bend of the staircase, a sense of unease tightening in his chest.
This was uncharacteristic of Sadie; she was unusually calm today. Kyla, her heels clicking assertively, sauntered toward Noah, her lips curved in a seductive smile.
“Noah,” she cooed, gracefully linking her arm with his. “I’d love to accompany you to the anniversary celebration tonight.”
Noah responded absentmindedly with a simple, “Hmm,” his thoughts still lingering on Sadie’s unusual behavior.
“Would you join me to choose a dress?” Kyla pleaded, tugging at his sleeve.
With a hint of irritation, Noah replied, “I’ll have the driver give you a ride.”
Kyla paused, taken aback, then nodded her compliance.
She knew about the dress Noah had gotten for Sadie.
Yet, after tonight, Sadie would vanish without a trace.
Then, no one would rival her.
Watching Kyla walk away, Noah massaged his temples and made his way to his study.
Having changed into the attire provided by Noah, Sadie observed herself in the mirror.
The deep red gown made her complexion glow, its fine cut enhancing her elegant silhouette.

###Chapter 123:
Yet, staring down at the high heels, she felt a stir of unease.
Escaping in high heels would prove challenging.
Yet, going without them would surely raise Noah’s suspicions.
With a sigh, Sadie forced herself to put on the shoes.
There was a knock at the door.
“Mrs. Wall, you need to be going,” a servant’s voice called respectfully from the other side.
Taking a quick breath, Sadie concealed her phone against her chest securely and then opened the door.
Noah was casually reclining on the sofa downstairs, examining some paperwork.
At the sound of footsteps, he glanced up, giving Sadie a thorough once-over.
Today, there was a noticeable change in Sadie.
She appeared more poised and self-assured.
“What a hassle,” Noah muttered under his breath, visibly annoyed yet unable to conceal a spark of admiration.
Dismissing his remark, Sadie strode confidently towards the exit, pausing as she waited for the driver to open the door.
At that moment, Kyla descended the stairs, an elegant handbag in hand, her movements graceful and effortless.
“Noah, wait up,” Kyla called out sweetly, hooking her arm through his as they walked.
A slight frown marred Sadie’s features; she wasn’t in the mood to watch their flirtatious interaction along the way.
Above all, Sadie needed a moment to slip away.

“This car is too small,” she said decisively, her tone full of intent.
Noah chuckled dismissively, thinking Sadie was just being difficult. “Bring around a different car,” he commanded the driver, his voice tinged with derision.
A stretch Lincoln soon rolled up to the front door. Sadie compressed her lips.
Noah quietly relished Sadie’s evident annoyance.
“Come on, what are you waiting for? Get in,” he said impatiently.
Silently, Sadie climbed into the car and closed the door behind her. She watched the streets rush by, the outside world a blur as she meticulously planned her next move.
Before they arrived at their destination, she had to devise a meticulous plan.
Kyla remained close to Noah, her voice sweet as she said, “Noah, these leather seats are so comfortable. They must be imported from Ivernia, right?”
Her hand subtly grazed Noah’s, her tone flirtatious.
Across from them, Sadie looked out the window with an impassive face, seemingly unaffected by her surroundings. She kept her gaze fixed outside.
Kyla, smirking at Sadie’s indifference, teased, “Noah, look. Sadie isn’t even saying anything.”
Occasionally, Noah’s eyes wandered to Sadie.
Tonight, her silence was deep, unsettling him.
The car grew quiet, punctuated only by Kyla’s sporadic laughter.
Eventually, they pulled up to the Pearl Hotel’s grand entrance.
The entryway was brightly lit, swarming with guests in fine attire. As they disembarked, Kyla naturally tried to link arms with Noah, but he deftly sidestepped her.
He approached Sadie instead, taking her slightly cold hand in his. When Sadie instinctively pulled back, Noah tightened his hold and whispered, “Remember your place.”

###Chapter 124:
At that moment, Sadie realized she was still bound to him as his wife and reluctantly accepted his arm.
Her face remained unsmiling, her expression laced with sarcasm.
She wondered who he was performing for. Was it Kyla?
Sadie glanced at Kyla.
A flicker of resentment was evident in Kyla’s eyes.
Inwardly, Sadie scoffed.
Lights bathed both Sadie and Noah as guests gathered, praising their apparent harmony.
“Mr. and Mrs. Wall, what a beautiful couple you make!”
“Mrs. Wall, you look marvelous today. That dress is a perfect fit for your style.”
“The love between Mr. and Mrs. Wall is truly something to behold.”
While Sadie heard the flattery, it left her heart untouched.
She was desperate for any reason to escape this overwhelming atmosphere.
“I need to use the restroom,” Sadie said coldly, avoiding Noah’s gaze.
Noah caught her wrist and, smiling enigmatically, suggested, “Let me accompany you.”
Sadie briskly freed her hand, her voice low and tense as she hissed, “Have you lost your mind?”
Noah simply chuckled, casually draping an arm around her waist and steering her toward a quieter area.
“Something’s off with you tonight,” he murmured, his voice carrying a probing undertone. “What are you planning?”
Sadie felt a pang of anxiety but masked it with defiance, retorting, “What do you expect? Should I play the devoted wife? At a celebration, accompanied by both your wife and your lover, are you not worried that people will think you’re playing the field?”

Her voice dripped with sarcasm, and her eyes were cold as she suggested, “Why don’t you spend your time with your dear Kyla instead?”
With those words, Sadie forcefully shoved him aside and made her way to the restroom.
Noah remained rooted to the spot, his face a mask of uncertainty as he watched her depart.
Kyla navigated the crowd effortlessly, her smile enchanting and her conversations with guests light, though her gaze often drifted towards Noah.
When she noticed his stillness, a smirk secretly formed on her face. Kyla realized that Sadie’s attempt to slip away alone was futile and thought she might have to intervene for the fool.
Circling the restroom, Sadie found no windows for a possible escape.
The constant flow of people meant any unusual behavior would quickly draw attention and likely alert Noah.
Feeling trapped, she decided it was best to leave the area for now.
When Sadie emerged, Noah eyed her suspiciously but remained silent. At that moment, Kyla approached, bearing two glasses of champagne, her expression sweet.
But as she reached Sadie, Kyla’s foot seemed to catch on something, sending her lurching forward, and the champagne splashed all over Sadie’s dress.
“Oh no!” Kyla let out a startled cry as she stumbled backward. Sadie fought the urge to roll her eyes. What a pathetic act. But Kyla’s over-the-top performance played right into her hands.
Sadie masked her disdain with feigned shock, glancing down at her champagne-soaked dress, her expression the picture of mild panic.

###Chapter 125:
“My dress…” she murmured, just enough to sell the scene. “Kyla, are you alright?”
Noah’s attention snapped immediately, his concern surfacing in an instant.
His voice was filled with worry, his eyes scanning her as if she might crumble at any second.noveldrama
“I’m sorry, Sadie. I didn’t mean to spill the champagne on you…” Kyla let out a soft, breathy sigh, adding with a wince, “I think I twisted my ankle.”
“It’s fine,” Sadie said coolly, turning to leave. “I’ll just go get changed.” She seized the opportunity, eager to escape the suffocating tension. But just as she pivoted, Noah’s hand shot out, his fingers wrapping around her wrist with surprising force.
“I’ll come with you.”
A flash of panic darted through Sadie’s eyes as she yanked her wrist, trying to break free from his grip.
“That’s not necessary. I can handle it myself,” she replied, forcing a calm tone even as urgency clawed at her. She needed to get out of there—fast.
But before she could make another move, Kyla gasped sharply, her hand flying to her chest as she staggered, her face going pale.
“Noah… my chest… it’s killing me…” Her voice was barely a whisper, strained and weak, like she might crumble to the floor any second.
Noah’s focus snapped to her instantly. His fingers loosened around Sadie’s wrist as he rushed to Kyla’s side, slipping an arm around her to steady her wobbling frame.
“Kyla, what’s going on? Talk to me!”
The guests, drawn by the sudden commotion, crowded in, their whispers quickly growing louder.
“What’s happening to Miss Wade?”
M s  s.
“Should we call for a doctor?”
“Maybe she should be escorted to the hospital—now!”
While all eyes were on Kyla and her dramatic display, Sadie quietly edged toward the back of the hall. Without hesitation, she slipped through the door and into the cool night air.
She broke into a run, her breath sharp and ragged, her heart slamming against her ribs like it was trying to escape her chest.
Every few steps, Sadie glanced over her shoulder, worried that Noah might chase after her.
But then she reminded herself—with Kyla putting on such a show, Noah wouldn’t have the presence of mind to think about anyone else. Sadie exhaled shakily, realizing her fears were running ahead of her.
Once she’d left the hotel’s noise and lights behind, she slowed down enough to catch her breath. Pulling out her phone with trembling fingers, she quickly dialed Alex’s number.
“Alex, I’m at the back entrance of the hotel. Can you send someone to get me?” Sadie’s voice wavered slightly, but she fought to steady it, trying to keep her composure.
“Got it. I’ll handle it right away,” Alex replied, his voice calm and reassuring, a steady anchor amidst Sadie’s growing anxiety.
Just as she was about to end the call, a sudden screech of tires tore through the quiet night.
A black car barreled around the corner at an alarming speed, its headlights blinding. Sadie barely had a second to react before a crushing force slammed into her, lifting her off her feet.
Pain exploded through her body as she hit the ground hard, her phone flying from her grasp and skidding across the pavement.
“Ah!” A raw cry of agony escaped her lips as her vision blurred, darkness creeping in at the edges.

###Chapter 126:
Through the haze of pain, she saw a shadowy figure step out of the car. The man’s face twisted into a sinister grin as he approached, his footsteps slow, deliberate.
“Noah really is an idiot,” the man said, his voice dripping with malice. “Did he seriously think he could protect you?”
Sadie’s mind reeled. Noah? What did any of this have to do with him? She tried to speak, to ask the questions swirling in her fading consciousness, but the metallic taste of blood filled her mouth. Her strength ebbed away, and the world around her dissolved into darkness.
In the distance, the shrill wail of an ambulance siren pierced the night air.
Kyla lay on a stretcher, clutching her chest, her face contorted in pain and ghostly pale.
Noah stood beside the ambulance, his eyes shadowed with worry as he watched the medics load Kyla into the vehicle.
His brows furrowed, his expression clouded with a mix of confusion, frustration, and something he couldn’t quite name.
Kyla reached out with trembling fingers, clutching Noah’s sleeve. Her voice was barely audible, a fragile whisper. “Noah…”
But Noah didn’t respond. His eyes drifted past Kyla, scanning the entrance of the hotel. Where was Sadie?
Where had she gone?
A sudden, sharp unease coiled in his chest. Without another thought, he jerked away from Kyla’s grasp and strode back toward the banquet hall, his steps quick and purposeful.
“Noah! Noah!” Kyla’s voice rose, tinged with panic and desperation. But she was too weak to follow, her pleas fading into the background as Noah disappeared through the door.
His face was set, grim and determined, his mind racing with worst-case scenarios.
I/t?$+ ?h?pt?r?  g?vê.c?m
He grabbed the first person he saw, a startled waiter, his voice dropping to a cold, dangerous tone. “Where’s Sadie?”
The waiter’s eyes widened in fear. “I don’t know, Mr. Wall…” he stammered, his words trembling in the tense air.
Noah shoved him aside, his unease now morphing into full-blown dread.
He moved swiftly, his long strides carrying him through the hotel toward the back entrance. As soon as he pushed through the door, the stark contrast hit him—the quiet, almost haunting stillness outside felt miles away from the banquet hall’s lingering laughter and music.noveldrama
Then he saw it. Under the flickering streetlight, a dark red stain smeared across the pavement, standing out vividly against the concrete.
Noah’s pupils constricted, and a heavy, suffocating weight dropped into his chest.
Noah’s body trembled as he crouched beside the chilling pool of blood, his fingertips grazing the surface. A shiver surged from his hands, coursing through him with icy dread.
Just inches away, Sadie’s handbag lay discarded, its contents spilled out like silent whispers of the chaos that had unfolded.
“Damn it!” Noah hissed, a storm of emotions swirling within him. In a sudden burst of fury, he stood and slammed his fist against the wall. Pain exploded through his hand as his knuckles split and blood mingled with the paint, a sharp contrast to the pale barrier.
Taking out his phone, he dialed with unsteady hands.
“Find Sadie immediately! I need to see her, dead or alive,” he commanded, his voice a rough whisper laden with barely contained rage and a tremor of fear.
“Hmmm…” A faint groan pierced the silence. Sadie’s eyelids fluttered, fighting against the weight of her weariness.
As her eyes cracked open, a harsh white light assaulted her senses, forcing her to squint against the brightness.

###Chapter 127:
She was enveloped by an endless white expanse, the sterile scent of disinfectant hanging heavy in the air.
A ventilator pressed uncomfortably against her face, hindering her breaths.
Awareness slowly crept in—she was in a hospital.
Her blurred sight slowly sharpened, forming the outline of a concerned figure standing over her. It was none other than Alex.
Recognition flickered through her foggy mind, and a wave of relief washed over her. Her heart, which had been pounding in wild disarray, settled into a more steady rhythm.
Thank goodness it wasn’t Noah.
“You’re awake, Sadie!” Alex’s voice carried a trace of concern as he lightly brushed his hand against her forehead. “How are you feeling?” he asked softly, his eyes searching hers for any sign of discomfort.
Sadie gave a feeble shake of her head, her voice just a raspy whisper.
“Water…” she murmured weakly, her lips barely moving.
Without hesitation, Alex grabbed a glass and filled it to the brim before gently assisting her in sipping.
The cool water glided over her parched lips and down her throat, offering a fleeting respite from her discomfort.
“Take me away from here,” Sadie muttered urgently, gripping Alex’s hand with surprising strength. Her voice was fraught with desperation. “Please. Take me away.”
Her eyes, wide and haunted, seemed to see something horrifying beyond the sterile hospital walls.
“I don’t care if I die—I just never want to see Noah again.”
Your next story is here g?lnσνels?com
Alex felt a painful squeeze in his chest, seeing her fear.
“The private jet is ready,” he assured with quiet confidence. “We can leave anytime you want. But your condition—it’s precarious. It’s best to rest here, under medical care, for a few more days. We’re safe, Sadie. We’re not in Jazmah anymore. This is my territory. Noah won’t find us here.”
But Sadie was shaking her head fiercely, tears cascading down her cheeks in silent testimony to her resolve.noveldrama
“No. I want to leave now,” she insisted, her voice quivering with determination. “I can’t bear another minute here.”
Seeing the resolve in her eyes, Alex realized that arguing would be pointless.
“Alright,” he said with a heavy nod. “I’ll arrange for us to leave immediately.” He stood, his silhouette framed by the window, and dialed the phone. His instructions were murmured into the receiver with an air of finality.
Sadie’s breath caught as the haunting memory of the crash reverberated through her closed eyelids.
The black car, the blinding headlights—it had all collided with the force of a tempest.
Everything had spiraled so quickly, a blur of moments that could have spelled her end.
But here she was, breathing, her heart beating a fierce rhythm of survival, clinging to the hope of a brighter future—a future where she could finally be free, with Noah out of the picture.
“Alex,” her voice cracked as she reopened her eyes, desperation shimmering within them. “Please, you have to help me. Make Noah believe I’m dead—that’s the only way he’ll…”
“Stop searching for me.”
Alex turned to face her, his features softening, his heart twisting at the sight of her drained face and the sheer fear in her eyes.

###Chapter 128:
Meanwhile, in the chilling glow of the study at Myrtlewood Estate, Noah’s fingers clicked the mouse in an impatient rhythm.noveldrama
The screen froze on a frame: a slender figure, Sadie, was caught in the merciless embrace of a black sedan, the dim streetlight casting long shadows over the scene.
Noah’s heart clenched, his breath hitching as the vice-like grip of dread and realization tightened around him.
As the footage played on, a figure emerged from the driver’s side—a man shrouded in the anonymity of a hat and a mask.
Despite the disguise, Noah’s eyes narrowed, recognition dawning with chilling certainty. There he was again—Ryder.
With steady steps, Ryder closed the distance, bent down, and said something in a hushed tone.
Through the flickering glow of the screen, Noah could almost feel Ryder’s smugness oozing through, as if the man were basking in the glory of his vile actions.
“Damn it!” Noah’s voice cracked the tense air as he slammed his fist down on the table, his knuckles whitening with the force.
In that instant, the surveillance footage sputtered and died, leaving the room cloaked in sudden darkness.
Noah’s fist struck the mahogany coffee table with a resounding “Bang!” His frustration spilled out in a guttural roar.
His teeth were clenched so tightly that it seemed the veins on his forehead might burst from the pressure.
“What happened to the rest of the surveillance? Why did it suddenly stop? Where’s Sadie? Is there still no news?” His questions flew like bullets, punctuating the heavy silence of the study.
Noah stood up abruptly, his imposing figure casting a long, ominous shadow across the room.

Samuel, standing beside him, trembled slightly, holding his breath.
“Mr. Wall, we still haven’t heard anything about Mrs. Wall. The surveillance… It appears to have been deliberately sabotaged. The tech team says it’s beyond repair,” he stammered, his voice barely audible against the thick tension.
Noah’s expression darkened, a storm brewing in his steely eyes.
“Where’s Kyla?” he demanded, his tone icy.
“Miss Wade is in the hospital. She… She’s been hoping you’d visit,” Samuel replied, his eyes darting nervously, cautious of Noah’s impending explosion of wrath.
“Find Ryder as soon as possible and bring him to me,” Noah commanded, his voice low and dangerous, filled with a promise of retribution.
“This time, he won’t escape again.” His menacing tone echoed ominously, as if sealing Ryder’s fate with each syllable.
Meanwhile, at the city hospital, Kyla lay in a private ward, her face pale and delicate, the very picture of fragility.
The soft click of the door opening stirred her, and she immediately lifted her head. When her eyes met Noah’s figure standing in the doorway, tears welled up in her gaze. “Noah, you’re finally here…”
Her voice was faint, laced with subtle grievance, as though she had been abandoned in her moment of need.
Noah approached the bed, his expression stern, his eyes cold and devoid of warmth.
Kyla’s heart fluttered anxiously under his chilling stare. She struggled to sit up, her body trembling with effort. “I’m in a lot of pain…” Kyla’s voice was barely a whisper as she clutched Noah’s hand, her tears spilling freely down her cheeks. “Did you really have an episode last night?”
The sudden shift in Noah’s tone sent a jolt through Kyla. Her eyes widened, and the little color left in her face drained completely.

###Chapter 129:
She bit down on her lip, trying to compose herself, but her gaze flickered nervously. “Noah… what are you talking about? I’m really not well. My chest—it hurts so badly—”
“Oh, really?” Noah let out a cold, humorless laugh, his eyes narrowing with suspicion. Without another glance at her, he turned to Samuel. “Go get the doctor who was on duty last night.”
Samuel didn’t hesitate. He spun on his heel and left the room, leaving a heavy silence in his wake.
Kyla’s heart pounded in her chest, dread creeping in. She clutched the quilt tightly, her knuckles turning white, fighting to keep her breathing steady.
Minutes later, Samuel returned with a doctor in tow.
“Tell me, Doctor—does Miss Wade’s condition match the emergency she claims it is?” Noah’s voice was like ice, his tone leaving no room for excuses.
The doctor glanced nervously between Noah and Kyla before finally speaking, his voice cautious. “Well… there are some minor issues with her heart, but nothing severe. We can’t entirely rule out the possibility of sudden complications, though.”
His words were careful, measured, as if he were walking a tightrope.
Noah gave a dismissive wave of his hand. “Both of you, leave.” Samuel and the doctor didn’t need to be told twice. They exchanged quick glances of relief before slipping out the door, closing it softly behind them.
“Noah… why are you questioning me like this? Don’t you trust me?” As soon as they were gone, Kyla turned to Noah, her eyes welling up with fresh tears. Her voice wavered, thick with feigned hurt.
But Noah’s stare only grew colder, his jaw tightening. The pity in Kyla’s expression did nothing to soften him; in fact, it solidified what he already knew in his heart. “Everything that happened last night…”
His voice was low, razor-sharp. “It was all part of your plan, wasn’t it?”noveldrama

Kyla’s face paled, the mask slipping as panic flickered in her eyes. “No… no, it’s not like that, Noah. You’ve got it all wrong!”
“Then tell me, do you know someone named Ryder Clifford?” Noah leaned in slightly, his gaze piercing through her.
Kyla’s breath hitched. “R-Ryder Clifford?” she repeated, her voice quivering. “I… I don’t know anyone by that name…”
Noah watched her carefully, the guilt etched across her face dissolving any lingering doubt. In that moment, he knew—she was involved in what happened last night.
“I’ll find Ryder soon, and when I do, the truth will come out.” With that, Noah spun on his heel and left the room without a backward glance, his footsteps echoing down the hall.
Back in the ward, Kyla collapsed against the pillows, her body trembling, her face as white as the hospital sheets. She never imagined Noah would suspect her—never thought he’d be so cold, so unforgiving. Meanwhile, outside the room, Noah’s expression hardened as he turned to Samuel.
“Keep an eye on Kyla. I want to know her every move. If she so much as blinks suspiciously, report it to me immediately.”
Samuel nodded sharply. “Yes, Mr. Wall.”
Without another word, Noah stalked out of the hospital and into his car.
He pounded the steering wheel with such force that the veins in his hands bulged, his knuckles white from the pressure.
Where the hell was Sadie? His mind kept replaying the same image—Sadie’s pale, fragile face and the horrifying pool of blood staining the pavement.
Minutes later, the car screeched to a halt in front of the bar belonging to Jim’s family.
Without hesitation, Noah jumped out, his stride purposeful and tense as he stormed through the bar’s entrance. 
.

###Chapter 130:
Inside, the bar pulsed with dim, flickering lights and pounding music. The air was thick with the sharp scent of alcohol and tobacco. At the bar, Jim sat alone, nursing a drink, his posture relaxed, as if the chaos around him didn’t exist.
When Noah stormed in, Jim’s eyes flickered with brief surprise, but he quickly masked it with indifference.
“Hello,” he said flatly, his tone devoid of emotion, as if he’d been expecting this confrontation all along.
“Where is Sadie?” Noah shot back, cutting straight to the point. Jim chuckled quietly, swirling the amber liquid in his glass.
“How would I know?”
“Don’t play games with me!” Noah snarled, lunging forward to grab Jim by the collar. His eyes burned with fury. “You and Sadie were plotting something!”
But Jim didn’t flinch. He met Noah’s glare with calm defiance.
“Playing games?” Jim scoffed, shaking his head. “Noah, you give me too much credit.”noveldrama
With a swift, sharp motion, Jim wrenched himself free from Noah’s grip, his eyes glinting with mockery.
“And why would Sadie be plotting with me? Hasn’t she always been your loyal little shadow?”
“Damn you!” Noah spat, his chest heaving with frustration, but deep down, he couldn’t find the words to argue.
“Noah,” Jim said quietly, his voice cutting through the tension, “you only realize the value of something once it’s gone. But by then… isn’t it too late?”
Noah’s fists clenched so tightly his nails dug into his palms, but the sharp sting didn’t register. All he could feel was the weight of Jim’s words.
Noah’s fist shot out with brutal speed, connecting squarely with Jim’s jaw. The crack of the impact echoed over the thumping bass of the bar’s music.

Jim staggered back, catching himself against the edge of the bar, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.
“Are you in love with Sadie?” Noah roared, his voice raw. His eyes were bloodshot, wild—like a caged animal teetering on the edge of losing control.
“In love with her?” Jim scoffed, shaking his head. “Noah, you really do think too highly of yourself. I’ve been with more women than I can count—why the hell would I be interested in your wife?”
“Then why are you protecting her?” Noah barked, grabbing Jim by the collar, his grip like a vice. His knuckles blanched as he pulled Jim in, his teeth clenched so tightly it looked like his jaw might snap.
“Because I can’t stand watching you tear down a good woman like that,” Jim shot back, his voice sharp, cutting through Noah’s rage like a blade. “Sadie’s given up everything for you. And you—you’re too blind and too fucking selfish to see it!”
With a sharp shove, Jim pushed Noah back, his eyes gleaming with disgust. “You’ve changed, Noah. You’ve turned into a selfish, hypocritical bastard, all for Kyla. And in the process, you threw away someone who loved you without question, like she was nothing.”
Noah’s chest heaved, his breath coming in ragged bursts. His fist shot up again, trembling in mid-air, ready to land another punch. Jim didn’t move. He just shrugged, a knowing smirk tugging at his bruised lips, as if he’d expected Noah to pull back all along.
“We’re not friends anymore.” Noah’s voice was low and hoarse, weighted with pain and disappointment he couldn’t quite mask.
Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode out of the bar, never once glancing back. Jim stood there, watching Noah’s figure disappear into the shadows, the echo of his words lingering in the air long after he was gone.
Sadie drifted in and out of consciousness, trapped in a fog of dizziness. Her vision was hazy, and a sharp, persistent ringing filled her ears. She blinked hard, trying to focus, and slowly, the sterile white of the hospital ceiling came into view.

###Chapter 131:
The sharp, clinical scent of disinfectant filled her nostrils, making her stomach churn.
“You’re awake, Sadie?” A familiar voice broke through the haze, warm and laced with concern.
Sadie turned her head slowly, wincing at the effort. Her blurry gaze settled on Alex, sitting at her bedside. His face was lined with exhaustion, but relief flickered in his eyes.
“Where… where am I?” Her throat was dry, the words barely a whisper.
“We’re in Cairhienen,” Alex replied gently, reaching for a glass of water. “I’ve taken care of everything.” He handed her the glass, his tone soft but firm. “Just focus on getting better. We’ll deal with the rest later.”
Sadie accepted the glass, sipping slowly. The cool water soothed her raw throat, offering a sliver of comfort amidst the lingering pain. “Thank you, Alex,” she murmured, her eyes meeting his with quiet gratitude. “I don’t know how I’ll ever repay you.”
Alex smiled, though there was something unspoken behind his eyes—a flicker of hesitation. “Actually… about Noah…” he started, his voice cautious.
“Don’t,” Sadie snapped, cutting him off. “I don’t want to hear his name. I’m done talking about the past.”
Alex paused, the tension settling between them like a weight. After a beat, he nodded. “Very well, just get some sleep then.”
Alex stood up, his footsteps light as he made his way to the door. He paused for a moment, his hand resting on the doorknob, as if on the verge of saying something. But whatever words lingered on his tongue, he swallowed them, slipping out silently and closing the door softly behind him.
Left alone, Sadie let out a shaky breath and gently placed her hand on her flat abdomen. Beneath her fingertips, she imagined the fragile pulse of life growing inside her, a warmth blooming in her chest despite the lingering fear.
If that black sedan had swerved just a few more centimeters…
?tst chαpt?rs in glnovels.c?
The thought clawed at her mind. She could’ve been lying in a morgue right now, her body cold and lifeless. The tiny life within her would’ve been snuffed out before it even had a chance to begin.
A tremor ran through her, the fear crashing over her in waves. But mingled with that fear was an overwhelming sense of relief—a fierce, bittersweet joy that she had survived. They had survived.
A single tear escaped, sliding down her cheek and soaking into the crisp white sheets, leaving a faint mark of everything she was feeling but couldn’t say out loud.
Sadie closed her eyes, drawing in a deep breath, steadying the whirlwind of fear and sadness swirling inside her.
Tomorrow… tomorrow would be a new beginning.
Ryder was thrown onto the cold concrete floor, the impact jarring through his bound limbs. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, a stark contrast against his pale skin, pooling beneath him like a dark stain.
Noah stood over him, his eyes cold and sharp, a predator circling its prey.
“Who ordered you to do this?” His voice was low, steady, but laced with a dangerous edge.
Ryder let out a guttural chuckle, spitting a mouthful of blood onto the floor, the crimson splatter vivid in the dim light. “Do whatever you want,” he said, defiance burning in his eyes.noveldrama
Without a word, Noah reached into his suit pocket and pulled out a photograph. He tossed it onto the floor in front of Ryder, the glossy image landing with a soft slap.
In the photo, a woman leaned intimately against a man, their faces obscured, but their closeness undeniable.
“Who’s the man with her?” Noah’s voice dropped, the words slicing through the tense air like a blade.
Ryder’s gaze flicked to the photo. A twisted grin curled the edges of his bloodied lips, and a hoarse, almost manic laugh escaped his throat. “Care to make a guess?” he taunted, his voice dripping with mockery.

###Chapter 132:
Noah’s patience snapped. He drove his foot into Ryder’s chest with brutal force, the thud of impact echoing off the walls.
“Answer me!”
Ryder doubled over, groaning in pain, coughing up more blood as his face drained of what little color it had left.
“I’d rather die than tell you,” he hissed, his voice raw. His gaze bored into Noah’s, filled with a dark, unrelenting hatred.
“You’ll never be loved,” Ryder spat, his words like poison-tipped daggers. “Just like me.”
The curse lodged itself deep in Noah’s chest, an unexpected thorn that pricked something raw and unspoken within him. He frowned, a wave of irritation and something darker rising beneath his composed exterior.
“What grudge do you have against me?” Noah demanded, his voice a low growl.
Ryder’s lips curled into a bitter sneer. He spat out two words, each syllable dripping with hatred. “Johnson Group.”
Noah’s eyes narrowed.
“Years ago,” Ryder continued, his voice seething with resentment, “Johnson Group got caught in a corporate war.”
“It went bankrupt.” Ryder’s voice was ragged, each word forced through clenched teeth, saturated with pure, unfiltered hatred. “My parents couldn’t handle the pressure. They jumped to their deaths. All of this—every bit of it—is thanks to you, Noah Wall.”
Ryder had hidden his true identity, letting his anger fester like an open wound. And now, his moment had come.
“And as for your wife… I already killed her.” His laugh was guttural, like something torn from the depths of hell.
“Serves you right!” he spat, his voice dripping with venom, each word laced with a satisfaction that cut deeper than any blade.

Noah felt as though the ground had been ripped out from beneath him. Ryder’s words slammed into him like a thunderclap, reverberating in his skull.
His pupils shrank sharply, and a wave of icy fear surged through his chest, suffocating and relentless.noveldrama
Without thinking, Noah lunged forward, seizing Ryder by the collar. His grip tightened with brutal force, his knuckles whitening as if he could crush Ryder’s bones through sheer rage.
“What did you just say?” Noah’s voice trembled, a mixture of disbelief and fury. “Sadie… is she… really gone?” His voice was barely a whisper, each word feeling like shards of glass in his throat, slicing deeper with every syllable.
Ryder let out a wild, guttural laugh, the sound echoing like a twisted melody in the air. His eyes gleamed with wicked satisfaction, as he savored Noah’s agony as if it were a prize he’d long waited to claim. That laughter shattered whatever fragile thread of control Noah had left.
Without thinking, Noah’s fist lashed out, slamming into Ryder’s face with bone-cracking force.
The sickening crack of the punch was followed by a low groan as Ryder crumpled to the floor, unconscious.
Noah’s hand trembled as he let go. His knees buckled beneath him, and he sank to the cold floor. His eyes stared into nothing, hollow and glassy, as though the soul had been ripped from his body, leaving behind only an empty shell.
At the same time, Kyla’s days in the hospital ward stretched into a slow, torturous blur. She wore the mask of a fragile patient, but beneath the surface, anxiety gnawed at her like a relentless parasite. The fear that Ryder might be caught—that he’d expose everything—hung over her like a noose tightening around her neck. It was suffocating. Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore.
“Doctor,” she said, her voice heavy with exhaustion, “I need to be discharged.”

###Chapter 133:
The doctor gave her a cursory examination and, seeing no medical reason to keep her, nodded in agreement. The moment the paperwork was signed, Kyla bolted from the hospital, her heart hammering against her ribs as she sped toward Myrtlewood Estate. She had to find Noah.
Bursting through the study door, Kyla froze. Noah sat slumped at his desk, his figure barely recognizable. The sharp, commanding presence of Wall Group CEO was gone. In its place was a man swallowed by grief, his eyes void of light, his face pale and gaunt, with stubble shadowing his jaw. The sight of him—so broken, so hollow—sent a chill down Kyla’s spine.
She stepped forward carefully, her voice soft, almost hesitant. “Noah… are you okay?”
“Pack up your things. I want you out of here as soon as possible.” Noah’s voice was like ice—sharp, cold, and utterly devoid of emotion.
Kyla felt her stomach twist, a wave of dread rising in her chest.
“What… what are you talking about, Noah?” she asked, her tone light, feigning confusion as if she hadn’t heard him clearly.
Noah slowly lifted his head. “Let me be clear—I want you out of my life.” His words were deliberate, each syllable dropping like a hammer. “It’s over between us.” His voice was final, leaving no room for negotiation, no space for hope.
Kyla’s face drained of color. She had anticipated many things, but Noah’s sheer ruthlessness wasn’t one of them.
“Noah, you can’t do this to me! I saved your life, remember? Back then—I risked everything for you.” She clung to the only leverage she had left, but Noah’s expression didn’t waver. If anything, his eyes grew colder, his jaw tightening.
“If it hadn’t been for you, I wouldn’t have been in danger at all.” His voice sharpened with anger as he suddenly stood, towering over her. “If you hadn’t insisted on following me into that dangerous place, I never would’ve crossed paths with those people.” His eyes blazed with disgust and something even deeper—hatred.
Kyla’s body trembled, a slight but undeniable shiver running through her. She hadn’t expected Noah to speak with such cutting finality. “Noah, I…” she began, her voice fragile, but Noah didn’t let her finish.noveldrama

“Enough!” he snapped, his voice like a whip cracking through the tension. “I don’t want to hear another word from you.”
Without missing a beat, he barked an order toward the door, his tone ice-cold and authoritative. “Keep searching for Sadie. I want her found—dead or alive.”
Kyla stood frozen, her face drained of color, her entire body trembling. She felt the ground shift beneath her, realizing with a hollow ache that Noah’s disappointment wasn’t fleeting—it was absolute.
But as she quietly observed him, a flicker of realization sparked in her mind. He didn’t know. He hadn’t learned the truth about her from Ryder—not yet.
Still, Kyla knew better than to relax. Ryder was a ticking time bomb. As long as he was alive, he could destroy everything she’d built. Taking a deep, steadying breath, she forced herself to push the fear down.
The priority now was survival.
With Noah’s thoughts fully consumed by Sadie, his guard over Ryder had slipped. This was her chance.
Seizing the opportunity, Kyla sent some people to infiltrate the place where Ryder was being held. The operation was swift, silent—no one noticed his disappearance.
“You…” Ryder’s voice cracked, thick with shock. He instinctively struggled against the ropes binding him, his body tense with confusion and suspicion.
Kyla’s gaze swept over his disheveled, broken figure, a brief flicker of disdain crossing her eyes. “Don’t be afraid,” she said smoothly, her tone gentle but laced with hidden intentions. “I’m here to set you free.”
Ryder clung to a sliver of hope, his eyes lighting up with renewed life. “You mean… you’ll actually let me go?”

###Chapter 134:
“Absolutely,” Kyla responded with a smile that seemed warm, handing him a glass of water. “Drink this. It’ll calm your nerves.”
Without hesitation, Ryder accepted the glass and drank it down in one steady gulp.
Unbeknownst to him, Kyla had slipped a deadly, untraceable poison into the water.
The poison took effect swiftly. Ryder grasped his chest in agony, his face contorting in shock, before he crumpled to the floor in a heap. Kyla watched his convulsing body with a cold, emotionless gaze.
“Dispose of this,” she commanded her team, her voice void of warmth.
Her subordinates quickly removed Ryder’s body, erasing all traces of the incident. After adjusting her attire as if nothing had happened, Kyla made her way to Noah.
“Are you still searching for her?” she asked, entering Noah’s study with a false concern laced with hidden intent.
Noah, haggard and with worry etched into his face, looked up. “Kyla, hello,” he said weakly, overwhelmed by fatigue.
“Let her go, Noah,” Kyla said, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Weren’t you two heading toward a divorce anyway? Maybe it’s for the best if she just disappears.”
“Enough!” Noah exclaimed, standing abruptly and shoving Kyla back. His eyes blazed with rage. “You don’t understand anything!”
Kyla staggered from the push, anger flashing in her eyes, but she quickly masked it with a hurt expression.
“Why are you so harsh with me?” she asked, feigning distress. “I’m just worried about you…”
“Get the fuck out!” Noah shouted, pointing toward the door, his voice thunderous.
However, Kyla wasn’t easily dismissed. She left the study and hurried to find Isabel.

Tears streamed down Kyla’s face as she pleaded, “Mrs. Wall, you have to talk to Noah! He’s losing his mind over Sadie!”
Already predisposed against Sadie, Isabel’s irritation deepened after hearing Kyla’s words.
“Trouble seems to follow that woman wherever she goes!” Isabel erupted, slamming her hand on the table in anger before storming off to find Noah.noveldrama
“Sign this, Noah!” She threw the divorce papers at him, her voice firm and commanding. “You’re done with her after this.”
Noah glanced at the divorce papers, a mix of emotions crossing his face, but he remained silent.
“What are you thinking?” Isabel’s voice grew harsher as she saw his reluctance to sign. “Are you really going to disregard my advice because of her?”
Noah remained silent, visibly torn by his decision.
“Just look at what she’s done to you!” Isabel’s words dripped with disappointment as she observed his conflicted demeanor. “You’re letting her destroy you.”
“Mom, I don’t want to talk about this right now,” Noah murmured, massaging his temples, his voice tired.
“This needs to be discussed now. Your negligence at work, the past scandals—have you forgotten them all?” Isabel pressed, her voice sharp and filled with disdain for Sadie.
“Those issues are behind us, Mom,” Noah replied dismissively.
“Behind us? Do you realize the embarrassment she’s caused the Wall family?” Isabel was furious. “I’ve always said she wasn’t right for you. Kyla is everything Sadie is not—kind, moral, well-educated. How can Sadie compare?”
“Mom, about Kyla and me…” Noah began, clearly conflicted.
“You and Kyla belong together. It’s a blessing that Sadie is out of the picture. She was nothing but a hindrance!” Isabel insisted firmly. “Now, sign these papers and marry Kyla. Do it quickly!”

###Chapter 135:noveldrama
“I need to deal with something urgent right now, Mom. We can talk about the divorce later,” Noah responded, standing up to leave.
“Noah…” Isabel started, but he had already exited the room, leaving her alone with her frustrations.
Noah slouched in his office chair at Wall Group, overwhelmed by a sense of defeat. The people he had sent to search for Sadie had returned with no updates.
“Where could you possibly be, Sadie?” he muttered to himself.
Had she really managed to leave the city? Given her limited resources, escaping so quickly seemed unlikely. Perhaps she had help.
Suddenly, an idea struck him. Alex must be involved.
Springing from his chair, Noah grabbed his coat and rushed out.
Arriving at Howe Manor, he found it eerily quiet.
“Mr. Howe left for a business trip days ago,” the butler explained, his face marked with unease.
“Days ago?” Noah’s heart sank. His lead had vanished. It felt as if Sadie had disappeared from the world.
“Damn it!” he cursed under his breath, pounding his fist against a nearby surface, frustration boiling over.
Later, in the dim lighting of a local bar, Noah sought solace in drink after drink. The alcohol dulled both his senses and his heart. Visions of Sadie, sometimes smiling softly, sometimes resolute in her departure, haunted him.
“Sadie…” he whispered, his voice raw with emotion.
“Noah?” The soft inquiry came from nearby.
Kyla approached, her presence marked by a subtle fragrance. She steadied the drunken Noah, a glimmer of triumph in her eyes.
L?t?st chαpt?rs in glnovels.
“What are you doing here?” Noah asked, struggling to focus his eyes.
“I’ve come to take you home,” Kyla replied, her smile gentle as she led him outside.
Once inside a hotel room, Kyla eased Noah onto the bed. Looking at his face, she felt a surge of excitement she couldn’t contain. She began unbuttoning his shirt, leaning in close.
“Sadie…” Noah mumbled, still calling another woman’s name.
“Noah, it’s me,” Kyla whispered, panic flickering in her eyes.
As Noah’s clarity returned, he recoiled and shoved her away, his expression filled with disgust.
Kyla’s face turned pale, her eyes flashing with anger. “It’s me, Kyla, Noah,” she said, stepping closer to him again.
“Leave now!” Noah’s voice was cold, rejecting her again.
Kyla stood there reeling from the rejection, her eyes burning with fury. She hadn’t expected that even now, Noah’s heart was still with Sadie.
With a furious glare, she stormed out, slamming the door behind her.
In her car, Kyla slammed the door, her frustration boiling over. She hit the steering wheel hard, her nails threatening to pierce the leather.
“Damn you, Noah!” she muttered under her breath.
His thoughts were still with Sadie, not with her.
Kyla couldn’t come to terms with it. Why couldn’t he see her instead? Why did all his affection belong to Sadie alone? Why was she constantly overshadowed by Sadie?
Kyla inhaled deeply, attempting to calm her pounding heart. She reminded herself to maintain composure.
To her, Sadie’s disappearance was a stroke of luck. If Sadie remained out of the picture, Kyla was convinced she stood a chance. 
.
.

###Chapter 136:
She was determined to prove to Noah that she was a more suitable partner than Sadie.
Her plan was to erase Sadie from his heart and make him love her. Determination welled up in Kyla’s eyes, and a confident smile began to form on her lips. She ignited the car’s engine and accelerated away from the hotel.
In Cairhienen, another country, the sun cast a brilliant glow. From the floor-to-ceiling windows, the skyline with its towering skyscrapers and the lively streets below portrayed a vibrant urban life. Standing by the window, Sadie drew in a breath of the fresh air, feeling an overwhelming sense of relief and liberation.
She turned to survey her modest, yet tastefully decorated apartment, a slight smile playing on her lips. This was the space she had secured on her own; it was small, but it felt like home. Here, she could begin anew and embrace her true self.
A series of knocks interrupted her thoughts.
“Come in,” Sadie said, turning to look at the entrance.
Alex appeared, his arms laden with fruits and health supplements. “Sadie, how are you holding up? Feeling any better?” he inquired, his gaze laden with concern.
“I’m feeling much better, Alex. Thanks for all your support these days.” Sadie took a seat on the sofa and motioned for Alex to join her.
“It’s nothing. Being there for each other is what friends do.”
After placing the items on the coffee table, Alex settled into a chair opposite her. “What are your plans moving forward?”
“I’m determined to restart my career in design,” Sadie replied, her eyes shining with resolve.
“You’ve always been passionate about design, yet…” Alex paused, aware of the sacrifices Sadie had made for Noah.
“Let me stop you there,” Sadie cut in. “I’ve given it a lot of thought. I can’t continue sacrificing my own dreams for the sake of others.”

“But, at the moment, you…” Alex expressed his concern with a furrowed brow. “Do you have enough money? It takes significant funds to start over.”
“I’ve got it covered.” Sadie pulled out a sleek black card from her purse and laid it on the table.
“What’s this?” Alex inquired, looking confused.
“Nigel gave me this,” she explained.
Just then, Alex’s phone began to buzz.
Noah left a missed call and a voice message for Alex, inquiring if there was any update on Sadie.
Alex’s fingers tightened around his phone, but he chose to keep Sadie’s situation to himself. He returned the bank card to the table and looked at Sadie with a cool expression.
“Alright. Since you’ve decided, proceed. And remember, I’m here if you need assistance.”
“Thank you, Alex,” Sadie responded, her gratitude clear.
“Think nothing of it. We’re friends,” Alex replied, mustering a smile as he stood to leave. “I’ll let you rest now, Sadie. Take care. I’m off.”
“Okay.” Sadie rose to escort him to the door.
Once Alex departed, Sadie retreated to her room, where she gathered her drawing board and pencils. She inhaled deeply, her eyes filled with determination.noveldrama
This was her moment to prioritize her own life.
She resolved to revive her passion for design. Sadie’s pencil flew across the paper, bringing her innovative ideas to life. Engrossed in her work, she sketched tirelessly, channeling all her prior disappointments and frustrations into her art.
As the days passed, Sadie finalized her portfolio. She then sent her resume to Majestic Ego, the most prestigious design firm in Cairhienen. 
.

.
###Chapter 137:
Before long, an invitation for an interview landed in her inbox. On the day of the interview, Sadie donned a sleek, professional outfit and strode into Majestic Ego with confidence.
During the interview, she passionately explained her design philosophy while showcasing her portfolio. Her evident talent and enthusiasm won over the interviewers, who offered her the job immediately.
Thus, Sadie embarked on a new career path with Majestic Ego.
Three years later.
Standing by a floor-to-ceiling window, Sadie gazed out at the lively night lights of Cairhienen. Despite the beauty before her, her attention was elsewhere. She gripped a black pen tightly, her fingers tense and pale. Her face conveyed a turmoil of emotions, and she was lost in thought.
“Sandra, Averi is awake.”
A soft knock on the study door interrupted the quiet, followed by the gentle voice of Nina Welch, the nanny. Startled from her reverie, Sadie set the pen down and moved toward the door.
“Coming,” she replied softly, a tender smile breaking across her face. She opened the door to find her young son, dressed in cartoon pajamas, sleepily calling out, “Mommy.”
Overcome with affection, Sadie quickly approached and lifted her son into a warm embrace.
“My sweet boy, did you have a good nap?” Sadie asked, planting a kiss on Averi Hudson’s rosy cheek.
Averi wrapped his arms around Sadie’s neck, nestling closer. “I did, Mommy. Can you hold me?”
Sadie smiled and scooped her son up, walking him over to the living room sofa. “Just watch some cartoons for a little while, Averi. I need to go work on some designs upstairs, okay?”

Averi gave a small nod, his attention already captured by the television.
Suddenly, the doorbell rang.
Nina moved to answer it, and soon Alex stepped through the door.
“Alex!” Averi shouted, his face lighting up.
With a warm smile, Alex approached and lifted Averi into his arms. “Have you missed me, Averi?”
“Yes!” Averi responded, hugging Alex tightly around the neck.noveldrama
After a few playful moments, Alex glanced towards Nina.
“Is Sadie upstairs?” he asked.
“She’s in the study, Mr. Howe,” Nina replied, her smile reflecting her familiarity with Alex due to his frequent visits.
“Let’s go see Mommy, shall we?” Alex suggested, carrying Averi towards the staircase.
“Yes!” Averi cheered, clapping his hands in excitement.
As they neared the study, Sadie stepped out and saw them. “Averi, why don’t you have some dinner with Nina first?” she suggested, catching a glimpse of Averi behind Alex.
“Mommy, look, Alex is here!” Averi exclaimed, pointing at Alex with joy.
“Yes, I see him, Averi. Please go have your dinner now. Mommy needs to talk to Alex,” Sadie said, stroking her son’s hair softly.
Averi then walked to the dining room with Nina.
Alex gazed at Sadie, his expression filled with concern. He approached her, paused, then said hesitantly, “Sadie, there’s something I need to tell you… it’s not good news.”
A wave of dread washed over Sadie. “What happened?” she inquired anxiously.
“It’s your grandmother… she’s very sick.”
Hearing this, Sadie turned ashen. “How bad is it? What’s happened to her?” Her voice quivered as she fought back tears.

###Chapter 138:
“The doctors are not hopeful about her condition,” Alex replied, his voice laden with sorrow as he met her tearful gaze.
Tears began to flow down Sadie’s cheeks. Over the last three years, Alex had been instrumental in helping care for her grandmother, Laura, which made the news particularly devastating.
“I must go to her. I need to see Grandma,” Sadie responded, her resolve steeling.
Alex stared at her, his face etched with empathy. “Maybe we could bring your grandmother to Cairhienen,” he suggested.
Sadie’s eyes were red as she quickly responded, “No, Alex.”
She inhaled deeply, striving for composure, and explained, “Grandma has lived her whole life in her hometown. She won’t handle the change in climate and the time difference here in Cairhienen.”
Sadie paused, her voice tinged with self-reproach. “And I’m so busy with work that I can’t take care of Grandma properly.”
Alex looked at her sympathetically, feeling a mix of sorrow and helplessness. “Have you made up your mind?” he asked in a deep voice. “If you go back, Noah… he might find you.”
At the mention of that name, Sadie shivered slightly, then crossed her lips. “I’m not the same Sadie from three years ago,” she declared, her voice sparking with resolve. “I have the means and the confidence now. I won’t let him control me anymore.”
Alex felt a wave of relief seeing her determination. “What about your job?” he inquired, concern evident in his tone.
Sadie remained composed; she had already strategized her next steps. “I plan to start my own brand,” she stated confidently. “After three years at Majestic Ego, I’ve gained invaluable experience. It’s time.”noveldrama
Admiration flickered in Alex’s eyes. He was aware of Sadie’s capabilities. “That’s a great idea,” he expressed his support enthusiastically. “If you need any help, just let me know. I could even invest and become a shareholder,” he added, half-jokingly, to lighten the mood.

Tears welled up in Sadie’s eyes as she looked at him gratefully. “Thank you, Alex,” she said sincerely. “Without your support, I wouldn’t have been able to become the renowned Sandra or come this far.”
“Why do you always have to be so formal with me?” Alex laughed. “Once you’re back home, I won’t have to keep traveling back and forth.”
“Hmm?” Sadie seemed to miss his implication.
Alex’s expression flickered, and he coughed to cover up his slip. “Nothing,” he quickly said, feigning ease, though his heart was pounding.
He regarded Sadie with deep affection. Over the past three years, he had watched her overcome her challenges, growing stronger and more intriguing every day.
Without realizing it, she had captured his heart. Yet, because of Noah, Alex had never been able to confess his feelings, always conflicted about his attraction to a friend’s wife. But now, he sensed that an opportunity might be on the horizon.
The next day, Sadie took a deep breath to steady her excitement and pushed open the door to the office of Majestic Ego’s design director. “What’s up, Sandra?” Amy Flores, the design director, asked, setting aside her design draft and looking up.
Sadie approached Amy’s desk and gently placed a light gray envelope on it. “Amy,” Sadie’s voice faltered slightly. Over the past three years, she had dedicated so much effort and passion to her work here, and the thought of leaving filled her with a mix of emotions.
Amy picked up the envelope, slid out the resignation letter inside, and quickly skimmed through it. Her blue eyes widened in surprise as she looked up at Sadie. “You’re resigning?”
Sadie nodded, managing a small smile. “Yes, Amy, I am.” She paused, gathering her thoughts. “I want to return to Helva to further my career.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 139:
Amy set the resignation letter down, clasped her hands together, and leaned forward, her expression serious. “Sandra, I know your talents. You have a promising future here. Why choose to leave now?” Amy’s voice held a note of regret; she truly didn’t want to lose such a talented designer.
“I appreciate that, Amy. I’m truly grateful for all the guidance and trust you’ve given me these years.” Sadie’s eyes conveyed her deep gratitude. Amy had been more than a boss; she was a mentor and a friend.
“But I need to start my own journey,” Sadie added.
“In Helva? Right, you came from Helva.” Amy thought for a moment before making an offer. “How about this, Sandra? Our company has a branch in Helva. I could arrange for you to transfer there as the design director. The salary and benefits will be at least as good as here. What do you think?”
Sadie was taken aback by Amy’s proposal. After a moment of silence, she shook her head.
“Thank you for the offer, Amy, but I’m committed to starting my own brand.” Her voice was firm, reflecting a decision that had been carefully thought through.
Seeing the determination in Sadie’s eyes, Amy realized that any further persuasion would be futile. She sighed, her expression tinged with regret.
“Alright, Sandra. Since you’re sure, I support your decision. But remember, my offer remains open.” Amy then picked up a pen and signed the resignation letter.
“I hope we have the chance to work together again in the future,” Amy said, handing the signed resignation letter back to Sadie, her voice sincere.
“We definitely will, Amy.” Sadie accepted the resignation letter, a look of relief washing over her, accompanied by a hopeful smile.
Sadie stepped out of the director’s office, her signed resignation letter clutched tightly in her hand. Returning to her desk, she began packing her belongings, while her colleagues gathered around her, their faces filled with reluctance at her departure.
“Sandra, are you really leaving?” a young designer asked, his voice tinged with regret.

“Well, we won’t be working together anymore,” another colleague added.
“How about we throw you a farewell party?” someone suggested.
Sadie looked at the familiar faces around her, touched by their warmth. She gently shook her head, politely declining. “No need. I appreciate the thought. Let’s catch up another time.”
Just then, Vivi Quinn, another designer from Helva, sauntered over, her high heels clicking sharply on the floor. A subtle smirk played across her face.
“Oh, Sandra, are you leaving? I thought you’d be more reluctant,” Vivi said, her voice laced with sarcasm.
Sadie met her gaze, her expression composed and poised. Vivi had always viewed Sadie as a competitor, enjoying any opportunity to overshadow her. Now, with Sadie leaving, Vivi couldn’t resist the urge to needle her.
“Even if you’ve made a name for yourself at Majestic Ego, don’t overestimate your chances,” Vivi said, her disdain barely veiled. “Going solo is no small feat.”
Sadie responded with a calm smile. “With me gone, you’ll finally get that promotion you’ve been after. Congratulations.”
Her seemingly congratulatory words struck a nerve with Vivi, who had long envied Sadie’s position but lacked her talent. Vivi’s expression soured, and her retort was stifled as she glared at Sadie, frustration clear on her face.
“You all shouldn’t get too attached to her. You won’t see her again,” Vivi said.
The colleagues exchanged uneasy glances, torn between their regret over Sadie’s departure and the need to maintain good terms with Vivi, their soon-to-be supervisor. One by one, they drifted away, leaving Sadie to finish packing in solitude.
Sadie wasn’t bothered. She had long understood the dynamics of workplace politics. With a genuine smile at Vivi, she said, “I wish you great success.”

###Chapter 140:
Picking up her packed belongings, Sadie left the office for the last time. Behind her, Vivi watched, her face flushed with frustration, yet she was powerless in the face of Sadie’s dignified exit.
The next day, Sadie double-checked her suitcase, zipping it up, ready for her next chapter. Averi sat on the sofa, clutching his teddy bear, his eyes wide with curiosity.noveldrama
Sadie ruffled his hair gently. “Averi, are you ready? We’re about to leave.”
“I’m ready, Mommy!” Averi said, jumping off the sofa, his teddy bear bouncing along. They walked to the door, which rang just then.
Sadie opened it to find Alex. “Alex? What are you doing here? Weren’t you supposed to be back in the country?”
Stepping in, Alex took Sadie’s suitcase. “I came to pick you up,” he said. He ruffled Averi’s hair. “Hey Averi, have you missed me?”
Averi hid shyly behind Sadie, peeking out to murmur, “Hello, Alex.” Moved by Alex’s gesture, Sadie felt a warm glow.
They headed to the black car parked outside. Alex loaded the luggage and held the door open for them.
On the road, Averi asked, “Mommy, where are we going?”
Sadie looked into Averi’s innocent eyes and smiled gently. “We’re going to see Mommy’s beloved grandma,” Sadie replied softly.
“What’s she like?” Averi asked, his eyes sparkling.
“She’s kind-hearted and gentle. She’ll tell you stories and play games with you,” Sadie explained, her voice tender.
“Wow, she must be wonderful!” Averi clapped excitedly.
Alex, watching Averi’s joy in the rearview mirror, smiled. “We’re on our way,” he said. “Her health has improved, and she was discharged yesterday. A caregiver is there, so don’t worry.”

Relief swept through Sadie as she absorbed the news.
“Thank goodness,” she whispered, a mix of emotions stirring inside her.
Three years had passed, and she was finally returning to that familiar place, to see the person she had missed every day and night. With her eyes shut, she inhaled deeply, trying to steady her racing heart.
As the plane touched down, the darkness enveloped Jazmah. Averi, sleepy, rested his head on Sadie’s shoulder.
“Mommy, have we arrived?” he asked in his sweet voice.
Sadie kissed his forehead gently. “Yes, darling, we’re here.”
Alex parked his car outside the faculty housing where Laura resided. He took out the luggage from the trunk and opened the car door. Sadie, with Averi in her arms, got out of the car. Her shadow, long and slender, stretched under the dim streetlight.
Alex pressed the doorbell. The door soon opened to show a middle-aged woman, Laura’s caregiver.
“Mr. Howe, welcome,” she said with respect.
Acknowledging her with a nod of his own, Alex turned to Sadie. “Let’s head inside.”
Taking a deep breath and clutching Averi’s hand, Sadie stepped through the door.
Laura’s room, though small, was meticulously kept. There, Laura rested on her bed, looking notably pale. Tears filled her eyes as Sadie came into view.
“Sadie, my dear, it’s been so long,” she said with a trembling voice, reaching out to clasp Sadie’s hand firmly.
Sadie’s cheeks were streaked with tears.
“Grandma…” she managed to say, her voice breaking with emotion. It had been three years since she had last seen her beloved family member.

###Chapter 141:
Averi observed their tears, unsure of what to do. He slipped out of Sadie’s arms, approached the bedside, and gently dabbed at Laura’s cheeks with his small hands.
“Please don’t cry, Great-Grandma and Mommy,” he said softly, his young voice soothing.
Through her tears, Laura smiled at the sweet child in front of her. “Is this lovely child?” she asked affectionately.
Sadie’s heart sank. Explaining Averi’s identity to Laura seemed daunting. After a brief pause, she chose to lie. “He’s… Alex’s son.”
Taken aback for a moment, Alex quickly caught on. Approaching the bedside, he wrapped an arm around Sadie.
“Yes, he’s my son,” he said firmly. “Due to family ions to our relationship, we had him overseas.”
Laura gazed at Sadie, her eyes filled with empathy. “My dear, you have endured so much,” she said, before shifting her gaze to Alex, her tone tinged with disapproval. “Alex, how could you let Sadie face such difficulties?”
Holding Sadie’s hand tightly, Alex responded earnestly, “Don’t worry. I’ll marry Sadie soon and ensure she is recognized as she deserves.” Emotion tinged his voice, stirring a flutter in Sadie’s heart.
After soothing Laura, Alex got ready to leave. “Laura, Sadie, it’s time for me to head out.”
At the doorway, Sadie bid him farewell. “Thanks, Alex.”
“Don’t worry about it,” he responded, smiling. “You’ve just gotten back. Have you thought about where you’ll stay?”
“I’m still figuring that out,” Sadie quickly replied.
Pausing, Alex then suggested, “Maybe I could assist you in finding a bigger apartment? It might be more practical.”

Shaking her head, Sadie declined. “There’s no need, Alex. I can manage on my own.”
She preferred not to impose any further on him.
To help with Averi, Sadie hired a nanny, Carol Green.
“Mommy, where are you going?” Averi gripped her leg, his expression showing his reluctance to let her go.
Bending down, Sadie caressed his head. “I need you to be a good boy, okay? My grandma and I are going to the hospital for a check-up. I’ll return soon.”
“Can I come with you?” Averi looked up at her with hopeful eyes. Sadie smiled. “Next time, sweetheart. This visit, Mommy needs to discuss some things privately with my grandma.”
Averi nodded, though hesitantly. “Alright, but please come back quickly.”
“I promise, I will.”
As they left, Sadie held Laura’s hand tightly.
“How are you feeling, Grandma?” she inquired.
“Much better now,” Laura answered, affectionately squeezing Sadie’s hand. “Having you here really calms me.”
Tears welled up in Sadie’s eyes as she softly said, “Grandma…”
Swiftly, Sadie averted her gaze to the window, concealing her emotional state from Laura.noveldrama
“By the way, Sadie, have you and Alex set a wedding date yet?” Laura inquired unexpectedly.
A heavy feeling descended upon Sadie’s heart.
“Actually… we haven’t set a date,” she stammered.

###Chapter 142:
“Why haven’t you set a date yet?” Laura’s voice carried genuine concern. “You have a child now. Getting married soon would put my mind at ease.”
“We… we’ll definitely tie the knot,” Sadie responded, her tone noncommittal.
Explaining her complex relationship with Alex to Laura was beyond her.noveldrama
Laura exhaled a weary sigh. “I don’t quite understand you young people, but Alex is a catch. Don’t let him get away.”
Managing a strained smile, Sadie remained silent.
In the hospital, Laura proceeded to her appointment.
Seated in the corridor, Sadie absentmindedly scrolled through her phone.
Out of the blue, her phone buzzed.
It was a call from Amy, the design director at Majestic Ego.
“Hello, Amy.”
“Sadie, how are you? I heard you’re back in Helva,” Amy said.
“Yes, I’ve returned.”
“Our Jazmah branch is really in need of a design director. Won’t you reconsider your decision?” Sadie was taken aback. She hadn’t expected Amy to invite her to work at the company’s Jazmah branch again.
“Well… I’ll think about it.”
“Sure, I await your decision. Please let me know as soon as you can.”
Once the conversation ended, Sadie was lost in thought.
Standing at a crucial decision point, she felt unsure of her next steps.
Suddenly, she spotted Noah and Kyla approaching.

In a rush, Sadie concealed herself behind some thick greenery, her heart pounding.
She absolutely did not want to be discovered, especially here. Kyla was close to Noah, her hand on his arm, speaking softly with the doctor about something.
Sadie froze, trying to blend into the background.
Looking more closely, she noticed they were near the gynecology and obstetrics department. Could Kyla be expecting?
A bitter smile crossed Sadie’s face. Three years had passed; it made sense that Kyla might be pregnant. Indeed, time had a way of changing things.
Eventually, Noah and Kyla departed.
Taking a deep breath, Sadie prepared to retrieve Laura.
“Grandma, we can leave now,” she said, offering her arm to Laura.
“Okay,” Laura responded with a gentle smile, accepting Sadie’s support.
Unbeknownst to Sadie, a familiar presence was back.
It was Kyla.
Disbelief filled her. She blinked several times to ensure she wasn’t imagining things.
There was no mistake—it was indeed Kyla.
Kyla felt a sudden pang of anxiety. Despite all her efforts over the past three years, Noah had consistently resisted marrying her. With Sadie’s return, Kyla feared the stability of her relationship with Noah was at risk.
In a state of panic, Kyla watched as Sadie walked away, her eyes alight with a fierce resentment. She was determined not to let Sadie win Noah back.
Quickly, Kyla grabbed her phone and made a call, instructing, “Keep a close eye on Sadie. Report back on everything she does!”
After ending the call, Kyla gripped the medical report so tightly that her fingertips whitened. She got back into the car and nonchalantly tossed the report aside, her facial expression smoothing out.

###Chapter 143:
Noah glanced at his watch, an expression of impatience creasing his forehead.
“Drive me to the office,” he said to the driver, his voice devoid of warmth.
“Noah…” Kyla called tentatively.
She had claimed a heart issue as an excuse to have him join her for the check-up, hoping to spend more time with him.
However, once the check-up was over, his mind was set on returning to work.
“I’m still not feeling well…” she said, clutching at her chest and turning pale.
Noah glanced at her briefly, his eyes cold and detached.
“Let the driver take you back to the hospital after dropping me off,” he said, his voice strictly professional and emotionally distant.
A sense of despair washed over Kyla. She pressed her lips together, attempting a smile.
“It’s just fatigue. A little rest should help. I’ll be okay.”
“Alright,” Noah responded, his tone disinterested, his attention focused on the documents in his hand, not sparing Kyla another look.
The air in the car felt oppressively thick.
Drawing in a deep breath, Kyla struggled to contain her mounting frustration and worry.
“Noah, do you have any plans this evening? We could perhaps dine together,” she asked hesitantly.
Noah, without raising his eyes from his work, refused.
“No, I’m tied up with a meeting tonight.”
Another meeting?
Kyla felt like she was on the verge of exploding with frustration. She managed to maintain a composed facade, but her nails dug deeply into her palms.
“I understand,” she said, forcing a smile that was more a grimace than anything genuine.
The car sped along. When Kyla returned to her villa, she wore a stormy expression. She tossed her bag onto the sofa with a huff.
A servant approached cautiously and asked, “Miss Wade, should I prepare dinner?”
“No need!” Kyla snapped, causing the servant to flinch.
Just then, a man in a black suit entered and respectfully handed her a document.
“Miss Wade, here is the information you requested.”
Kyla snatched the document and quickly skimmed it. Her eyes widened in shock at one particular line, her hand trembling as she pointed at it.
“A child?! She actually has a child with her?!”
“Yes, Miss Wade. According to our investigation, Sadie disappeared more than three years ago and only recently returned, accompanied by a boy about three years old,” the man explained calmly.
Kyla stood abruptly, pacing the room as her high heels echoed against the floor, each step pounding like a drumbeat in her chest.
“Three years ago…” she muttered, remembering Sadie’s odd behaviors back then, her expression growing darker. “Could it be that Sadie didn’t lose her baby at that time?!”
She stopped, a fierce determination in her eyes. “She came back with the child to win Noah back! I can’t let her succeed!”
Jealousy flared within her, nearly overwhelming her. She grabbed the car keys from the table and said icily, “Get the car ready!”
Determined to confront Sadie immediately, Kyla arrived at the faculty housing and took a deep breath to calm herself before entering the building with poised steps.noveldrama
Inside, the soft, dim lighting of the hallway cast a warm glow on Sadie, who was holding the sleeping Averi and murmuring gently to him. She had hoped for a peaceful night, but Kyla’s unexpected visit disrupted that.

###Chapter 144:
Not wanting to worry Laura and Averi, Sadie whispered to Carol, “Carol, please take Averi and my grandma back. I’ll handle this.”
Carol gave Sadie a worried look but nodded, gently carrying Averi and assisting Laura back into the apartment.
Sadie turned to face Kyla, who regarded her with a mocking smile. After three years, Kyla still radiated glamour but now carried a more assertive air, stripped of her previous innocence.
“Well, if it isn’t the great designer Sadie? I thought you were dead!” Kyla said, her arms crossed, her voice dripping with sarcasm.
Sadie responded with a faint smile, her voice steady, “Sorry to disappoint you, Miss Wade. I’m very much alive.”
Three years had changed much. Gone was the timid Sadie of the past. Now, she stood with firm confidence, her gaze steady.
Kyla felt a twinge of unease seeing Sadie’s transformation. Was this really the same Sadie she once manipulated so easily? The woman before her now was composed and unflinching, her eyes reflecting a depth Kyla found unnerving.
However, Kyla’s unease quickly morphed into smug superiority.
Sadie dropped her calm facade, her eyes turning icy as she looked into Kyla’s eyes. “It’s quite late. Why are you here?”
Kyla replied, “I saw you at the hospital today and thought I’d drop by. Didn’t expect you’d have a child with you…”
She paused, her hand lingering over her flat stomach, her smile loaded with implication.
Sadie’s expression hardened, her hands balling into fists—a reaction Kyla noted with vindictive satisfaction.
“The child is adorable. He looks just like you,” Kyla said, continuing her provocation.

“If you’ve come just to see the child, you’ve seen him. Please leave. I don’t want any trouble,” Sadie said, her voice icy, her anger barely contained.
“Trouble? Get this straight, Sadie. You’re the one causing trouble. Three years, and you’re still here in Jazmah. Don’t tell me it’s not because you’re still hung up on Noah.” Kyla’s voice was cutting. “Take my advice and move on. He’s with me now, and we’re getting married soon.”
Sadie took a deep breath, striving to keep her emotions in check. “I returned solely to care for my grandmother. This has nothing to do with you or Noah.”
Kyla scoffed coldly. “Really? You expect me to believe that? You abandoned Noah for money three years ago. Now, you’re back, trying to rekindle old flames, aren’t you?”
“What are you talking about?” Sadie’s voice rang out, every syllable dripping with anger. “I never planned to cross paths with Noah ever again!”
“Really?” Kyla retorted, her tone laced with skepticism. “It’s been three years, and not once has he tried to reach out to you, Sadie.” A glint of malice sparked in her eyes as she leaned in closer. “Do you know what Noah said after your car accident three years ago? ‘It’d be simpler if she just disappeared.'”
Sadie felt the sting of those words as if a blade had sliced through her soul. Her entire body shook, her complexion turning ghostly, her jaw locked tight.
“Get out of my sight!” Sadie seethed, her fists tightening. “I don’t care about Noah, and I don’t want you near me! I swear, I’ll never see him again!”
With those final words, she pivoted on her heel and strode away, her steps faltering but filled with fierce determination.
Kyla’s eyes narrowed as she watched Sadie retreat. A shadow of doubt flickered across her face. She wasn’t convinced Sadie had truly moved on.
“Keep watch over her,” she murmured icily to the empty space before turning to leave.

###Chapter 145:
“Kyla?” A deep voice shattered the stillness.
Whirling around, Kyla found herself facing Alex, who stood at the shadowy threshold of the corridor, his brow creased and his eyes reflecting a chilling frost.noveldrama
“What the hell are you doing here?” Alex demanded sharply. His sudden presence seemed to snatch the smug grin right off Kyla’s face.
Kyla blinked, momentarily thrown off balance, but she swiftly masked her surprise, her eyes flickering with defiance before settling back into their usual haughty glare.
“Oh, Alex, what a coincidence,” she drawled, her voice dripping with feigned surprise. “Still playing the gallant knight for Sadie after all these years?”
Alex’s expression turned stormy, his voice cold and steely. “Kyla, what exactly are you up to?”
With a sneer curling her lips, Kyla’s eyes sparkled with scorn. “What am I up to?” she huffed, leaning in closer. “Just paying a visit to an old friend. But you, Alex—three years and still chasing after Sadie’s affection? How… romantic.”
She stretched the word, her voice thick with sarcasm, mocking Alex’s unrequited devotion.
Alex’s hands balled into fists at his sides, his jaw tightening as he fought to keep his anger in check. “Kyla, whatever you think is going on with Sadie and me, you’re wrong.”
Kyla’s eyebrow arched maliciously, and her smirk widened. “Oh? It isn’t what I think? Then enlighten me, Alex—whose child is that?” Her gaze landed on the door to Laura’s apartment, her question hanging heavily in the air like a charged accusation.
Alex inhaled sharply, his chest heaving as he struggled to maintain control. He was keenly aware that he couldn’t let Kyla uncover the truth, nor could he risk her spilling everything to Noah.
With a tense voice, he shot back, “This is Sadie’s personal matter—it has nothing to do with you.”

“Personal matter? Sounds more like something scandalous,” Kyla retorted, her voice dripping with scorn. “Alex, you really should open your eyes. Don’t let that woman fool you!”
Alex felt a surge of frustration but restrained himself, fearful that Noah might appear out of nowhere, leaving him scrambling for an explanation.
Steadying his voice, he warned, “Kyla, enough! Stay out of this! She’s done with the chaos—let her have the peaceful life she deserves and don’t bother her again!”
Kyla laughed harshly, disbelief clear on her face. “A peaceful life? If peace is really what she’s after, why come back to Jazmah? Face it, Alex—you’re blind to how she’s manipulating you!”
Alex’s eyes narrowed, a cold fire burning behind them. “That’s none of your business! Get the hell out of here!”
Turning around, Kyla strode toward her car parked along the roadside. Pausing by the door, she threw Alex a loaded glance. “If you’re really in love with her, you’d better stake your claim fast. You’re not the only one interested.”
With those parting words, she slid into her car and sped off.
Alex stood there, watching the red taillights fade into the distance, his brow creased with worry and contemplation. He lingered for a brief moment, then turned and made his way to Laura’s apartment.
With a gentle rap on the door, he waited, his heart pounding with a mix of anticipation and dread. When the door swung open, Sadie stood there, her smile tired but welcoming.
“Alex, what brings you here at this hour?” she inquired softly, her voice a gentle murmur.
“I needed to see how you and your grandmother were holding up,” Alex replied, stepping inside with concern evident in his voice. “How is she?”
“She’s resting, already turned in for the night,” Sadie whispered, her gaze dropping slightly. “Kyla stopped by earlier.” 
.

###Chapter 146:
Alex’s brow furrowed deeply. “What was she after this time?”
“Just her usual drama, trying to stir things up,” Sadie responded, her tone even, almost indifferent, yet a subtle strain hinted at the annoyance simmering beneath the surface. “Alex, do you think she’ll tell Noah about me?”
Alex gave her a reassuring look. “She probably won’t. She’s not that reckless. But I do think Kyla could be a real threat. I have a hunch she was involved in that car accident three years ago. Remember, aside from us, she was the only one who knew about your plan to slip away from the banquet.”
Sadie’s complexion drained, her eyes wide with a flicker of fear. “You mean…”
“I’ll look into it,” Alex declared, his voice resolute with determination. “Don’t worry, I’ll keep you, your grandmother, and Averi safe.”
After bidding Sadie goodbye, Alex drove back to his place.
As he unlocked the door, a pungent odor of alcohol hit him. Stepping into the living room, he found Noah slumped on the sofa, clutching an empty bottle, his gaze unfocused and distant.
“You’re back,” Noah murmured, his voice rough and tinged with the bitterness of drink.noveldrama
Alex felt a sudden tightness in his chest, a sense of foreboding washing over him. “Why are you here? And why have you drunk so much?”
Noah gave a self-deprecating laugh. “What, am I not welcome?”
“It’s not that,” Alex replied, sitting down across from him and picking up the bottle from the coffee table to pour himself a drink. “I’m just surprised you found time to visit today.”
“It’s been three years, Alex. You’ve been hard to see,” Noah said, his gaze piercing as he watched Alex. “What have you been so busy with abroad? So secretive.”
Alex took a sip of his drink, keeping his tone casual. “Just the usual business.”
New chapters available g?lnσνls?com
“Business?” Noah scoffed. “What kind of business has you jetting off to different countries all the time?”
Alex’s eyes flickered momentarily, but he quickly regained his composure. “You know how it is—expanding globally is part of the process.”
After a pause, Noah’s gaze turned icy. “Alex, be straight with me. Is Sadie hidden abroad by you?”
Alex’s heart skipped a beat, but he maintained his composure. “What are you talking about? Sadie left long ago, and I have no idea where she is.”
Noah scrutinized his face, searching for any sign of deceit. “Really? Your recent travels seem highly suspicious.”
Alex shifted his gaze away and changed the subject. “When are you planning to marry Kyla?”
Noah’s expression darkened, and he fell silent, as if lost in thought. Seeing this, Alex fell silent as well. The two of them sat there, each holding their drink, enveloped in a heavy silence.
Suddenly, a phone rang, shattering the stillness. Noah glanced at it, noticing the caller ID read “S.” He moved to answer it.
But Alex was quicker. He snatched the phone and stepped outside. “I’ll take this call.”
Outside, Alex answered and said, “Hello, Sadie.”
“Alex, I… I want to start my own brand and was hoping you could introduce me to some professionals in this industry. Is that okay?” Sadie’s voice was tentative.
“Of course, no problem at all,” Alex responded promptly. “I’m free tomorrow. We can discuss it then.”
“Thank you, Alex.”
After ending the call, Alex walked back into the living room to find Noah staring at him with a cold expression.
“Who was that on the phone?” Noah asked, his voice icy.

###Chapter 147:
“Just my secretary,” Alex replied.
“Secretary? A secretary calling at this hour? Alex, do you think I’m a fool?” Noah’s tone was sharp with sarcasm as he reached out, trying to grab Alex’s phone.
Alex sidestepped, holding the phone away from him. “You’re drunk. Stop making a scene.”
“I’m not drunk!” Noah insisted, grabbing Alex’s arm with surprising strength. “Give me the phone!”
“Let go!” Alex snapped, pulling his arm free. “Noah, enough! Stop this drunken spectacle!”
He turned to the butler and said, “Please take Mr. Wall home. He shouldn’t be causing a scene here.”
The butler hesitated, glancing between the two men, then stepped forward to assist Noah. “Mr. Wall, perhaps it’s best if you head home to rest.”
Noah resisted, his gaze locked on Alex’s phone, but the butler eventually led him out.
Watching them leave, Alex exhaled deeply, quickly opened his phone, and changed Sadie’s contact name to “Allen,” vowing to be more discreet in the future.
Noah woke the next day with a splitting headache, the previous night’s events vivid in his mind. He summoned his assistant, Samuel. “Investigate everything about Alex, especially his travels over the last three years. I want details. And keep an eye on him. Report back anything unusual immediately.”
Samuel nodded and left to execute the orders.
The same day, Alex met Sadie at her grandma’s apartment as promised.
“Thank you, Alex,” Sadie expressed her gratitude warmly.
“It’s the least I could do,” Alex replied with a smile. “Let’s not keep the professionals waiting.”
Exclusive updates gαlησνs.c?m
They had dinner at an upscale private club, where, thanks to Alex’s connections, the professionals in the design industry were particularly welcoming to Sadie. They praised her portfolio and offered valuable advice. After dinner, Sadie thanked Alex again.
“Alex, I really can’t thank you enough. Meeting these people wouldn’t have been possible without your help.”
“It was the least I could do,” Alex said with a faint smile. “By the way, have you thought about the studio? If you need, I can help you find a suitable place to rent.”
Sadie thought for a moment before refusing. “I can handle it myself. Thank you.”
Meanwhile, Samuel handed Noah a stack of photos.
“Mr. Wall, these are Mr. Howe’s activities from this afternoon.”
Noah took the photos and flipped through them. Suddenly, he paused at one. In the picture, Alex was walking alongside a woman. Though she wore sunglasses, Noah recognized her instantly—it was Sadie!
A torrent of suppressed longing surged within him, and Noah could no longer contain himself. Snatching up his car keys, he rushed out, driven by a singular desire to see her.
Outside Laura’s apartment, Noah knocked forcefully on the door. The door swung open, and Sadie, taken aback, said, “N-Noah?”
Inside, Laura’s voice echoed. “Sadie, who is it?”
Sadie didn’t want Noah to find out about Averi. She managed to keep her composure. “It’s… a friend. I’ll just step outside for a moment.” Taking a deep breath, she stepped out and gently closed the door behind her.
“What are you doing here?” she asked, her voice tense.
As Sadie descended the stairs, Noah grabbed her wrist with surprising force.
“Noah, what are you doing? Let go of me!” Sadie exclaimed, struggling to free herself.noveldrama
Without a word, he dragged her through the quiet campus roadside, beyond the gates. Ignoring her protests, he suddenly pressed her against the cold metal of the car and kissed her. 
.

.
###Chapter 148:
The kiss was forceful, marked by a fierce possessiveness that seemed to overpower Sadie.
“Mm… let… let go…” Sadie desperately twisted her head away. Noah’s breathing grew heavier. He scooped her up and tossed her into the car.
The car door slammed shut with a bang, muffling the sounds of the outside world.
He leaned in closer, his presence pressing against her as he gently pulled her shirt open, exposing her delicate shoulders.
Sadie’s eyes widened in fear as she noticed the intense emotion in his gaze. She knew it all too well.
A loud slap echoed inside the car.
Noah paused suddenly, his expression shifting to one of surprise. He looked at Sadie, a mix of emotions flickering in his eyes, quickly replaced by anger.
“Noah, get a grip!” Sadie’s voice trembled with fear and anger. “We’re already divorced!”
“Divorced?” Noah said, his face close to hers. “The divorce papers aren’t signed. You’re still my wife, Sadie!”
Sadie closed her eyes in despair, tears streaming down her face. Noah kissed her again, this time more gently, but the humiliation for her deepened.
Feeling her tremble and the tears on her cheeks, Noah finally paused. He gazed at her, a tumult of emotions swirling in his eyes.
“Where have you been these three years?” His voice was low and hoarse.
“Where I’ve been is none of your business,” Sadie responded coldly, regaining some composure.
“None of my business?” Noah said, his smile turning into a mocking sneer. “Are you refusing to be intimate with me because of Alex? Did you ask him to take you away?” His tone was accusatory.
Sadie pushed him away with all her strength, her eyes flashing with anger.
Explore magic at g?lnσν?s．c?
“Noah, stop this madness! You have no right to control me anymore! From the moment you decided to get a divorce, everything between us was over,” she declared firmly.
Noah opened his mouth to argue, but Sadie cut him off.noveldrama
“Enough!” She took a deep breath to steady herself. “Noah, it’s over between us. Please don’t disturb my life anymore.”
With that, she pushed open the car door and walked away without looking back.
Noah sat in the car, watching her depart, his expression unreadable. After adjusting her slightly disheveled clothes, Sadie walked back to her grandma’s apartment slowly.
As soon as she entered, a small figure rushed over, hugging her leg tightly.
“Mommy, where did you go? I missed you!” Averi’s soft, childish voice carried a hint of sadness as he looked up with big, hopeful eyes. Sadie’s heart melted. She bent down, lifting him into her arms and kissing his chubby cheek.
“I just had to run some errands. Were you a good boy?”
“I was!” Averi nodded enthusiastically, his arms tightening around Sadie’s neck.
Sadie smiled.
“Sadie, you’re back? Why so late?” Laura appeared from the kitchen with a steaming bowl of soup. “Come have some soup to warm up.”
“Thank you, Grandma.” Sadie set Averi on the sofa and took the bowl, sipping the soup thoughtfully.
Laura watched her with concern. “Has Alex been busy recently?”
Sadie paused. “Yes.”
Laura sighed. “Alex is a good man. He’s been very kind to both you and Averi…”
“I know,” Sadie said. “But right now, I need to focus on my career, so I might not have much time to look after you and Averi.” 
.

###Chapter 149:
Laura looked surprised.
Sadie glanced at Averi, who was playing with his toys. “Don’t worry. Carol will come during the day to help.”
Laura nodded after a moment of silence.
Back in her room, Sadie took a deep breath, trying to settle her thoughts. She opened her laptop and continued refining her brand logo design. The company registration was nearly complete and would be finalized in about two weeks. Time was pressing, and she needed to focus on preparing her brand.
“It has to succeed,” she murmured to herself.
Yet, the memory of Noah’s forceful kiss haunted her. Frustrated, she rubbed her temples, struggling to focus. She spent the night restless and uneasy.
The next morning, with dark circles under her eyes, Sadie grabbed her purse and headed out, determined to face the day.
“Grandma, I’m going to check out some office spaces. I might not be back for lunch,” she said.
“Alright, be careful on the road,” Laura responded, her voice tinged with concern.
Sadie then contacted the real estate agent she had previously spoken with, detailing her requirements.
“Miss Hudson, I found a few office spaces in the city center according to your budget. Shall we take a look?” the agent suggested enthusiastically.
Together, they toured several office buildings. One in particular caught Sadie’s eye due to its ample lighting and suitable size.
“How do you feel about this one? If it’s suitable, we can start the contract process,” the agent said.
Sadie hesitated for a moment. “It’s not bad. But…”
Updates always live at galησvls?com
“Do you have any concerns, Miss Hudson? Actually, there’s another one that might suit you even better. It’s near Wall Group, prime location, and the price is about the same,” the agent added.
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat, and she almost blurted out, “No, this one will do.”
She wanted nothing more to do with Wall Group.
“Alright, Miss Hudson, I’ll prepare the contract,” the agent said, noticing her reluctance to explore further options.
Sadie took the documents for the chosen office space and went with the agent to the agency to sign the contract. Sitting in the waiting area, she reviewed the contract terms, trying to push aside the unease in her heart.
“What a coincidence, Sadie.”
Kyla’s piercing voice shattered the silence. Sadie looked up to see Kyla striding in on high heels.
“What brings you here, Miss Wade?” The agent quickly stood up, his face breaking into a polite smile.
Kyla glanced at Sadie disdainfully, her lips curling into a mocking smile. “Noah said he’d buy me a place and let me choose.”
Sadie’s fingers tightened slightly around the contract, but she kept her face impassive.
“Oh? Tired of living at Myrtlewood Estate?” Sadie asked.noveldrama
Kyla’s demeanor stiffened, her gaze sharpening. “Sadie, stop with the sarcasm! What right do you have to be so arrogant now?”
Sadie let out a soft, cold laugh, locking eyes with her. “I’m just curious, Miss Wade. It’s been three years, and you still haven’t moved into Myrtlewood Estate?”
The air grew heavy with tension, both women poised on the brink of a confrontation.
The real estate agent shifted uncomfortably, his eyes darting nervously between Kyla and Sadie as perspiration dotted his brow. “Uh… you’re both my clients. Let’s talk this over calmly—”
.

.
###Chapter 150:
Kyla cut him off, her chin tilting defiantly, a hint of imperiousness in her posture. “I’ve made up my mind—I want this office space, your price. I’ll pay double.”
Her eyes flicked towards the contract clutched in Sadie’s hand, a wave of vindictive triumph washing over her.
Sadie’s gaze held a spark of sarcasm as she gently placed the contract on the table, her hands elegantly folded in her lap. “Do you understand the cost of renting office space in the prime downtown area, Miss Wade? Can you truly afford to pay double?”
Kyla was momentarily at a loss for words, her face flushing a deep shade of red. She hastily grabbed the contract to scan the figures, and when she saw the numbers, her expression turned to stone.
She had blurted out her offer to demean Sadie, not expecting to be cornered by her own brash statement.
Sadie rose, her presence imposing as she looked down at Kyla and said with a serene yet foreboding tone, “A piece of advice, Miss Wade. Think twice before putting on a tough act—know what you can handle first.”
Kyla’s eyes flickered with surprise as she met Sadie’s unwavering gaze, but she quickly composed herself, her voice sharpening. “What… what are you renting this place for, anyway?”
Sadie took the contract back, throwing Kyla a cool, disinterested look. “What concern is that of yours?” she asked, her tone flat and dismissive.
Tired of the bickering, she was eager only to ink the deal and escape the stifling atmosphere of contention.noveldrama
She turned to the real estate agent with a resolute expression. “Let’s get on with the signing. If that’s not possible right now, I need to leave.” Her voice carried a finality that brooked no argument, and she pivoted on her heel, poised to depart. The real estate agent, catching the urgency in her movement, was seized by a sudden panic.
This was a coveted piece of prime office space in the city’s pulsing heart, where leases commanded top dollar. Losing this transaction meant waving goodbye to a hefty commission.
“Miss Hudson, don’t worry about it. I’ll get it done right away.”

Smiling warmly, the real estate agent steered Sadie toward a lounge. “Take a seat and relax for a moment. I’ll have the contract and paperwork ready soon.”
Sadie settled into a plush sofa with a sigh of relief. Without Kyla’s prickling presence, the world seemed instantly more serene.
Shortly, the landlord bustled in, documents in hand and a welcoming grin plastered across his face. The signing unfolded without a hitch, and Sadie soon clutched her copy of the contract, ready to make her exit.
But as she stepped out into the fresh air, her eyes landed on Kyla, who was lurking under a nearby tree. Kyla leaned casually against the trunk, arms folded, her lips curling into a sly, knowing smile as Sadie emerged.
Finding the scene rather amusing, Sadie paused, shooting Kyla a look laced with sarcasm. “Well, well, a ‘big-shot’ lawyer like you lounging around here? You must be really worried about me staying in Jazmah, huh?”
“Worried? About you?” Kyla’s laugh was sharp and dismissive. “You’re making a big deal out of nothing—I was simply passing by.”
Sadie arched an eyebrow, her tone brimming with irony. “There aren’t any law firms for miles, Kyla. Your ‘simply passing by’ doesn’t make any sense.”
A flicker of annoyance shadowed Kyla’s features, but she masked it quickly with a cool smirk. “Don’t get ahead of yourself, Sadie.”
Uninterested in prolonging the confrontation, Sadie turned to leave, her steps firm.
“Stop!” In a swift motion, Kyla lunged forward, her fingers clamping around the contract in Sadie’s hand.
That was the last straw. Sadie’s patience snapped. She seized Kyla’s wrist, pushing it away sharply.

###Chapter 151:
Surprised, Kyla lost her balance, tumbling backward onto the soft earth with a heavy thud.
“I’m warning you—stop meddling in my affairs!” Sadie’s voice sliced through the air, icy and stern.
Stooping down, she picked up the contract, dusted it off with a flick of her hand, and strode away without a second glance.
Kyla’s gaze lingered on Sadie’s retreating silhouette, her eyes shadowed with a dark, brooding intensity. Rising smoothly, she brushed the stubborn dust from her clothes. A sly, knowing smile slowly curled the edges of her lips as she muttered under her breath, “Oh, Sadie, do you really think you’ve won?”
Taking out her phone, she dialed a number with a determined tap. “I need intel on Sadie’s plans for that office space—every last detail,” she commanded, her voice a mix of ice and steel.
As the shadows of evening stretched across the city, Sadie trudged back to her grandma’s apartment, her energy sapped. Her heart skipped a beat when she spotted a familiar black car parked by the curb—it was unmistakably Noah’s.
A knot of dread tightened in her stomach, urging her to evade him. With a hopeful breath, she attempted a stealthy detour around the building, only to collide with a figure at the entrance.
Noah was there, casually leaning against the doorframe, hands buried in his pockets, his expression unreadable yet undeniably expectant. Sadie’s brow furrowed, her grip on the folder tightening, her knuckles blanching with the strain.
“What are you doing here again?” she demanded, her voice strained with frustration and weariness.
Noah’s eyes flickered briefly to the folder clutched in her hand. “What? Have you taken up running errands for Alex now?”
Taking a measured breath, Sadie fought to keep her composure. “This has nothing to do with you, Noah,” she asserted firmly. Desperate to get away from him, she shifted to the side, longing to reach home.

However, Noah grabbed her wrist with sudden intensity. “Three years, Sadie. Three whole years. You owe me an explanation—why did you disappear? Was the idea of being my wife so repulsive to you?”
With a forceful tug, Sadie freed her hand and let out a mocking laugh, chilly and sharp. “Yes, exactly! I couldn’t care less about being your wife! Ha! Do you honestly think that’s…”
“Isn’t that something everyone dreams of?” Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears, a fiery defiance burning within them despite her efforts to remain composed.
She shot back, her voice steady yet icy, “We’ve been apart for three years, Noah. In the eyes of the law, we’re divorced. There’s nothing left between us. Stop pestering me!”noveldrama
“You’ve changed, Sadie. Who’s behind this newfound boldness? Alex?” Noah’s eyes narrowed into slits, a menacing glint emerging as he scrutinized her.
Sadie’s eyes flashed with open loathing, unwavering and intense. Noah was taken aback, never having encountered such a piercing stare from her before.
Just then, their tense standoff was momentarily interrupted by a passerby—a woman with a shopping basket—who greeted Sadie with a warm smile. “Hi Sadie, just finished work?”
Instantly, the hardness in Sadie’s expression melted into a warm, radiant smile. “Yeah, were you out shopping again?” Her tone lightened, filled with genuine cheer.
Noah lingered in the background, his sharp gaze locked on her, irritation simmering beneath the surface.
With a derisive snort, he remarked, “Well done. You’re getting faster at putting on a new face.”
Saying nothing more, he turned sharply and walked away.

###Chapter 152:
Meanwhile, Sadie’s face, once a mask of shifting emotions, settled into a blank slate as she watched his retreating figure. She understood Noah too well—he wouldn’t stop here.
He was just feeling things out. What would happen when he returned next time, or the time after that?
The possibility of Noah discovering Averi’s existence loomed large in her mind, threatening the fragile peace she had pieced together. A chill raced down her spine, anxiety flooding her senses like a cold tide.
She hastened into the apartment building, her fingers trembling as she fumbled for her phone and dialed Alex.
The phone barely rang twice before Alex answered with a soothing voice. “Sadie?”
“Can you do me a favor, Alex?” Sadie’s voice wavered ever so slightly, almost unnoticeable.
Alex’s response was immediate and grave. “What do you need? Just tell me.”
Sadie paused, her breath catching. “If Noah ever asks about Averi, could you… could you please say Averi is your son?” Her plea hung in the air, heavy with unspoken fears as she awaited his reply..
“You… You met with him?” Alex asked. “Did he give you a hard time?”
Sadie closed her eyes for a couple of seconds before taking a deep breath. “Yes, we met. I’m fine, I really am. You have nothing to worry about.”
“That’s good, then.” Alex’s relief was evident in his voice. “You have nothing to worry about, either. If he asks, I’ll say that Averi is mine. I’ll protect you two.”
Warmth surged in Sadie’s chest. “Thank you, Alex,” she choked out.
A beat of silence passed before Alex spoke again. This time, his tone was laced with hesitation. “So… How is the preparation of your studio coming along?”
“It’s going well. I found the perfect spot and managed to secure the lease. The company registration is almost done, too.”
M ?ρ?α  ?ασν.?σ?
“That’s great. I’ll be there when you open shop.”
“Sure thing.” Sadie smiled. “I’ll make sure to reserve a seat for you in the VIP section.”
They chatted a bit more about trivial matters.
“I’ll hang up now. Get some rest,” Alex said, though it was quite clear he didn’t want to end the conversation just yet.
“You, too. Good night.” In the end, it was Sadie who ended the call.
She had barely put her phone down when a knock came at the door. “Mommy! When are you taking me out to play?” a cute, whiny voice called out from the other side.
Sadie got up and opened the door. Averi stood there, his feet bare, his eyes bright, and his hands perched on his hips.
“It’s so boring here,” the little boy complained. “Let’s go out and play!”
Sadie crouched down to meet Averi’s innocent eyes. She knew she would be busy soon, so she might as well spend more time with her son while she still could.
“All right,” Sadie said as she patted Averi’s head. “I’ll take you out to play.”
Just as she had promised, Sadie took Laura and Averi to a nearby mall the next day. It was a rare family outing, and the three of them made the most of it. It took a few more days before Sadie’s studio was fully set up. All that remained was finding the right staff.
She posted a job advertisement online, and it wasn’t long before calls came in. Sadie wasted no time and got the recruitment and hiring process going.noveldrama
“Alex! What brings you here?” Sadie looked up in surprise when Alex suddenly appeared at the studio’s door.
“I thought I’d drop by to check out your studio. Also…” Alex held up the lunchbox he was carrying. “I brought lunch.”
“That’s very thoughtful of you. Thank you.” Sadie stood from her desk and took the lunchbox with a gentle smile.

###Chapter 153:
“Please, there’s no need to be so formal with me.” Alex seemed to be in high spirits as he looked around. “This place is really nice, very much your style.”
“Yeah,” Sadie replied with a light sigh. “I hope everything goes smoothly.”
It was then that the first applicant arrived. “Hello, Miss Hudson.” A young woman greeted Sadie nervously. “I’m here to interview for the designer position.”
“Yes, please have a seat.” Sadie gestured for her to sit down, then proceeded with the interview.
Soon, other applicants arrived one after another. While waiting for their turn, one of the interviewees kept eyeing Alex.
She eventually leaned close to the person next to her and whispered, “Isn’t that Alex Howe, the CEO of Howe Group? What is he doing here?”
“You’re right. I think it’s him. Maybe he and the owner of this studio…” The other person trailed off, but she didn’t really need to finish her sentence for the implication to come across.
Alex, sharp as he was, immediately noticed the subtle shift in the air. He cleared his throat and nodded at Sadie. “It looks like you’re going to have a busy day. I’ll be taking my leave now.”
“Okay, take care.” Sadie waved and watched him leave the studio. The moment Alex was gone, the whispered discussions among the young women grew more animated.
“I knew it! Those two must be connected in some way. Why else would Mr. Howe make time for such a small studio?” One of the more fashionable of the girls winked at her companion.
“I mean, who knows? Mr. Howe could well be an investor in this small business. Young women these days sure know how to use their charms to get ahead in life!”
Sadie pressed her lips together and took a deep breath. She put down the resume she had been reading and swept a cold glance over the remaining candidates.

“If you’re more interested in my personal life than the actual job offer, then I think I should end the interview here.”
Everyone was visibly shocked by the bite in her tone. They exchanged wary glances, not daring to speak another word.
“I didn’t mean anything, Miss Hudson,” one of the interviewees hurriedly said.
But Sadie held up a hand to stop her. “No need to explain. I’m looking for employees who will dedicate their attention and skills to their work, not vapid office gossip.”
“We understand, Miss Hudson,” the job applicants said.noveldrama
“Good, then please wait for further notice,” Sadie responded firmly, leaving no room for negotiation.
The applicants left the studio, their spirits low, and the room quickly fell silent.
Sadie massaged her temples, feeling a surge of fatigue wash over her. As she flipped through the remaining résumés, few stood out.
However, one portfolio caught her eye—belonging to an applicant named Glenda Kelly. Her design style was understated yet elegant, marked by a creative flair.
Just then, Glenda knocked and entered the office, her demeanor composed and her gaze clear. “Nice to meet you, Miss Hudson.”
“Hello, Miss Kelly. Please have a seat,” Sadie said, her interest piqued as she began the interview.
Throughout the discussion, Glenda demonstrated professionalism and a profound understanding of design, impressing Sadie further.
Ultimately, Sadie decided to hire only Glenda.
Meanwhile, at a café, Kyla listened to a report with a cold smirk. “A studio? Does she really think she can make a comeback? She should keep dreaming!”
A man in a black suit across from her bowed respectfully. “Miss Wade, everything is arranged.”

###Chapter 154:
“Ensure there are no mistakes,” Kyla said, taking a sip of her red wine.
“Absolutely,” the man answered before discreetly leaving.
Unbeknownst to Sadie, Kyla was plotting against her.
The next day, Sadie reviewed the job applications with a furrowed brow, finding it challenging to locate suitable candidates.
“Oh well,” she sighed, rubbing her forehead. “It looks like I’ll have to wait a bit longer.”
At that moment, there was a knock on the door.
“Come in, please.”
The door opened, and a well-dressed young man entered, his confidence evident.
“Hello, Miss Hudson. My name is Byrum Smith, and I’m here to apply for the designer position.”
Sadie looked up, assessing the newcomer who presented himself neatly and efficiently.
“Mr. Smith, please have a seat.”
Byrum sat down and handed over his résumé and portfolio.
“Miss Hudson, I’ve heard much about you. You’re quite renowned in the design circles of Cairhienen.”
Sadie offered a faint smile, taking the documents to review them closely.
Byrum’s work was bold, innovative, and practical, making a strong impression.
“Your work is quite impressive,” Sadie said, setting down the portfolio, her voice tinged with admiration.
“Thank you, Miss Hudson.”
“I’m looking for someone who can independently complete design projects and who takes responsibility seriously.” Sadie outlined her needs clearly.

“No problem. I can handle that,” Byrum responded confidently. “Additionally, I bring stable client resources.”
He reached into his bag, pulling out a document. “These are some of my recent collaborative projects. Please have a look.”
Sadie took the document and quickly scanned it, her expression showing a hint of surprise.
Byrum’s client list was impressive, featuring several well-known brands.
“Miss Hudson, I have one request,” Byrum said, his tone earnest. “I hope we can finalize the contract soon.”
Sadie looked up, meeting his gaze, her instincts slightly uneasy.
Byrum’s credentials were compelling, and she recognized his potential.
Yet, something about his eagerness felt unsettling.
After a brief pause, Sadie made her decision.
“Alright, I agree, but with a one-month probation period. Your salary will be as discussed, but we’ll hold off on signing the contract until the probation is complete,” she stated firmly.
Byrum’s expression tightened slightly.
“Miss Hudson, I assure you of my sincerity.”
“And I respect that, Mr. Smith,” Sadie replied. “But in business, precautions are necessary. If you accept these terms, start tomorrow at nine.”
Byrum masked his irritation and nodded with a forced smile. “No problem. I look forward to our collaboration.”
After he left the office, Byrum’s smile faded.
He quickly pulled out his phone and dialed a number, his voice betraying his tension.

###Chapter 155:
“Hello, Miss Wade, it’s done. I’m in, but Sadie insists on a one-month probation before signing the contract. She seems to trust me,” he said, his tone attempting to sound confident but revealing his anxiety.
“Byrum, I hope you’re not deceiving me. If I find out you’re up to any tricks…” Kyla paused.
“No, how could I possibly?” Byrum quickly interjected, a bead of sweat forming on his forehead. “Miss Wade, please rest assured. You can trust me. I’ll start right away and get her design drafts as soon as I can.”noveldrama
“Good,” Kyla’s tone softened slightly. “Remember, I want her reputation completely ruined. She must never recover.”
“Understood, Miss Wade,” Byrum responded immediately.
“You’ll be well rewarded once it’s done,” Kyla said before hanging up.
Listening to the beeps as the call ended, Byrum exhaled a long sigh of relief.
The next second, his phone chimed with a notification. He opened it to see a transfer of one hundred thousand dollars displayed on the screen. A greedy smile crept across Byrum’s face as he gazed at the substantial amount.
Meanwhile, Sadie was deeply focused on preparing for the upcoming project in her studio.
Suddenly, a shrill ringtone shattered the silence.
“Hello?” Sadie answered, her voice weary.
“Miss Hudson, Averi… He’s suddenly got a high fever. It’s really severe, and he’s been crying non-stop…” Carol’s voice was fraught with tears and urgency.
Sadie felt a pang of worry, and the documents she was holding dropped onto the desk.
“A fever? How bad is it? How is he now?” she asked, her voice laced with concern.
Ltτ ch?ɑρτ?rs ιn glov?l.?оm
“I took his temperature; it’s already 40 degrees. I… I don’t know what to do…” Carol replied, her voice trembling with panic.
“I’m coming right now. Use warm water to sponge him down and make sure he drinks plenty of water,” Sadie said hurriedly, grabbing her coat and dashing out.
“What about Grandma? How is she?” Sadie remembered Laura as she reached the door, her anxiety deepening.
“Laura’s okay, just worried about Averi. I’ve asked her to stay in her room while I look after him,” Carol replied, sounding a bit calmer.
“Good. Take care of Averi and Grandma. I’ll be there soon,” Sadie said, ending the call and sprinting to the parking lot. She started her car and sped toward home.
Throughout the drive, Sadie’s heart was racing.
Averi was her world; the thought of anything happening to him was unbearable.
When Sadie arrived home, she rushed into the room.
Seeing Averi’s flushed face filled her with concern. “Averi… Averi, Mommy’s here. Everything will be alright.”
“He’s still burning up; we need to get him to the hospital right now,” Sadie said, quickly scooping Averi into her arms.
“I’ll drive,” Carol said, following them swiftly.
At the hospital, the doctor examined Averi and administered a fever-reducing injection.
“Doctor, how is he?” Sadie asked, her voice filled with worry.
“He’s fine. It’s just a reaction to the new environment and the recent weather changes that caused the fever. The injection will help, and he should recover quickly with some rest,” the doctor said.
Relieved by the doctor’s words, Sadie finally relaxed.
“Thank you, doctor,” she said with heartfelt gratitude.
“You’re welcome. It’s my duty,” the doctor replied with a smile before leaving the room. 
.

###Chapter 156:
Relief washed over Sadie, grateful it was not a serious situation. She asked Carol to return home to look after Laura, while she stayed with Averi.
As night fell, Sadie dozed off beside Averi’s bed.
The next morning, Averi moaned softly and slowly opened his eyes.
“You’re awake, Averi?” Sadie instantly sat up, feeling his forehead. “How do you feel? Still uncomfortable?”
“Mommy, I’m a bit hungry,” Averi murmured, his voice soft and slightly whiny.
“Alright. I’ll get you something to eat,” Sadie replied, gently ruffling his hair.
Just then, the door to the ward opened, and the doctor entered with a nurse to make their rounds.
Sadie’s gaze landed on a young doctor in a white coat who looked vaguely familiar.
The young doctor paused, then smiled politely. “Sadie?”
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat.
“Jim?”
“It really is you, Sadie.” Jim’s voice was tinged with surprise and other emotions.
The nurse behind him looked curiously at Sadie, her expression intrigued.
“Yeah, it’s been a long time.” Sadie managed a smile.
Jim’s eyes then drifted to Averi on the bed.
The boy’s rosy cheeks and long eyelashes sparked a moment of recognition in Jim, but he quickly composed himself.
Jim hid the turmoil in his eyes as he looked away. The air thickened with tension for a brief moment.
“Let’s talk in the corridor,” suggested Sadie, breaking the silence.
Side by side, they walked to the corridor.
“Thank you for what you did three years ago. Without you, I don’t know what I would have done. Averi might have…” Sadie’s voice trailed off as her eyes shimmered with tears she fought to hold back. Jim saw her strained smile and felt a twinge in his heart.
Three years earlier, Sadie had appeared frail and despondent, her eyes brimming with despair. Now, she stood before him transformed, vibrant and full of life.
“How have you been these past three years?” he asked quietly.
Sadie replied with a smile, “I’ve been doing well. I’ve started my own business, and I’m staying with Averi. Life’s tough, but fulfilling.”
“That’s good to hear.”
“When Averi gets better, I’ll treat you to a meal to properly thank you,” Sadie promised earnestly.
Jim nodded. “Alright.”
He checked his watch. “I have other patients to attend to, so I should get going.”
“Okay, you go ahead,” Sadie said, watching him walk away. Her smile slowly faded.noveldrama
Averi’s fever quickly subsided. Watching her son sleep peacefully, Sadie sighed deeply.
Once he was discharged, she returned to her studio without pausing to rest. With the opening looming, she threw herself into her work.
Managing with a small team, Sadie aimed for perfection in everything she did. Byrum proved to be a diligent worker, bringing in a batch of clients, which greatly reassured her.
“Miss Hudson, please take a look. I’ve contacted these clients and sorted out their requirements,” Byrum said respectfully, presenting a file to Sadie.
“Thank you for your hard work, Byrum.” Sadie glanced over the file quickly. “These clients have high demands. We’ll need to step up our game.”

###Chapter 157:
“Yes, they are quite influential in the industry. Securing their orders would greatly benefit our studio’s development,” Byrum replied.
Sadie nodded her agreement. “I’ll finish the design drafts as soon as possible to ensure their satisfaction.”
In the subsequent days, Sadie practically sealed herself in the studio, laboring tirelessly both day and night.
“Miss Hudson, you haven’t slept for two days. You need to rest,” Byrum said, approaching Sadie with a glass of hot milk.
Sadie rubbed her eyes, weary from exhaustion, and managed a smile. “It’s okay. I can handle it. This is our studio’s first major project, and it needs to leave a strong impression.”
Finally, the day before the deadline, Sadie completed all the design drafts. She exhaled in relief and passed the drafts to Byrum.
“Byrum, I’ve been abroad for some time, so I’m not quite in tune with local tastes. Could you review these drafts and forward them to the clients? I need to rest,” Sadie said, her voice tinged with fatigue.
“Of course, Miss Hudson,” Byrum replied, his expression unreadable for a moment.
Sadie nodded and walked to the lounge. Overcome with exhaustion, she needed to sleep soundly.
As Sadie departed, Byrum’s lips twisted into a smirk. He pulled out his phone and made a call.
“Miss Wade, I have the drafts.”
“Good, proceed as planned,” came the cold reply from the other end. Byrum then anonymously uploaded Sadie’s design drafts to the internet.
Meanwhile, at Wall Group’s headquarters, Noah concluded his work and left his office. He rubbed his temples, preparing to end the day. Walking down the corridor, he stopped upon noticing Kyla by the window, her voice cold as she spoke on the phone.
Noah caught the name “Sadie” and frowned.
g?lnσνs?com hosts the latest chapters
“Who are you talking to?” he inquired with a deep tone.
Kyla turned sharply, nearly dropping her phone at the sight of Noah. “Oh… it was… It was Mrs. Wall…”
Noah eyed her skeptically. “Mrs. Wall…?”
She took a deep breath to steady herself. “She just called, inquiring about Sadie,” Kyla explained. “She heard Sadie was back… and asked when you and I could visit Wall Manor for dinner.”
Kyla observed Noah’s reaction carefully, her anxiety palpable.
Noah’s expression remained impassive. After a brief pause, he responded indifferently, “Is that so?”
“Yes… yes, that’s right,” Kyla said, managing a forced smile.
Noah remained silent, giving her a penetrating look. “Go by yourself, then.”
He then turned and entered the elevator, not looking back. Kyla watched as the elevator doors closed slowly and let out a breath.
She gripped her phone tightly, her palms sweaty.
In the underground parking lot, Noah settled into the back seat of his Maybach.
“Mr. Wall,” Samuel said respectfully, handing over a set of documents. “Here’s the latest update on Miss Hudson’s studio.”
Noah skimmed through the documents casually. The studio’s location, staffing, and even details about the first batch of clients were all meticulously documented.
“She’s moving quite fast,” Noah observed.
“According to reliable sources, the first project of Miss Hudson’s studio is complete, and the client is very satisfied,” added Samuel.

###Chapter 158:
Noah paused, his fingers resting on the page as his eyes landed on the words “Sadie’s Studio.”
“Keep an eye on it and report any developments immediately,” he commanded.
“Yes, Mr. Wall.”
Noah closed his eyes and massaged his temples. Sadie’s decisiveness was unsettling for him. He had expected her to cling to him after the divorce, pleading as she used to. But she hadn’t. She had left, as if he were merely a fleeting thought.
“Take me to Sadie’s studio,” he instructed the driver, his voice almost involuntary.
Upon arrival, Noah stayed in the car, observing the studio’s entrance through the window. As time passed, the lights inside the studio went out one by one. A slender figure emerged at the door—it was Sadie.
She had changed from her professional attire into a simple white dress. Unaware of the Maybach parked by the roadside, she walked to the curb and hailed a taxi. She told the driver the address of her grandma’s apartment. Inside the Maybach, Samuel cautiously watched Noah’s expression through the rearview mirror.
“Mr. Wall, should we…?”
Noah’s eyes stayed fixed on the taxi ahead, his lips pressed tightly together. The driver, Omar Ruiz, also gauged Noah’s mood through the mirror. Years of experience had taught him exactly what Noah was contemplating. With a slight turn of the steering wheel, Omar smoothly began to follow Sadie’s taxi.
The taxi eventually stopped at an older faculty housing complex. Sadie paid the fare and stepped out. Noah watched her until she vanished into the building, then he slowly averted his gaze.
“Mr. Wall, shall we head back—?” Samuel began, only to be cut off.
“Back to Myrtlewood Estate,” Noah said, his voice low and tinged with fatigue.
Samuel and Omar exchanged glances, both puzzled. Noah had rarely gone back to Myrtlewood Estate since Sadie’s departure. Without further inquiry, Samuel directed Omar to drive.
Upon reaching the apartment door, Sadie felt an inexplicable unease wash over her. She glanced at the dim streetlight, thinking she saw something move, yet nothing was there. The night breeze chilled her, prompting her to tighten her coat.
“Was it just my imagination?” she whispered, taking out her keys to unlock the door.
“Sadie, you’re back!” The comforting scent of home-cooked dishes and Laura’s warm smile welcomed her. On the dining table, dishes steamed invitingly, and Alex was setting the tableware.
“Grandma, why did you cook yourself?” Sadie quickly dropped her bag and hugged Laura.noveldrama
Laura patted Sadie’s hand, looking at her affectionately. “I invited Alex for dinner, so I wanted to treat the man I consider my grandson-in-law well. Go wash your hands. Dinner’s ready.”
Caught off guard, Sadie hesitated, then looked at Alex, her voice polite. “Alex, good to have you here.”
“I’m here to mooch a meal. Averi is already asleep,” Alex replied, pulling out a chair for her.
They sat down, and Laura served Sadie food, talking about everyday matters.
“Sadie, you and Alex are at a good age to think about marriage. When do you plan to get married?”
Laura’s question made Sadie pause mid-bite.
“We, uh…” Sadie began, but Alex cut in.
“We’re considering it. We’ll let you know when the date is set,” Alex said with a kind smile.
“That’s wonderful,” Laura said, her face lighting up. “I know you young people have your ways, so I won’t meddle. But Sadie, Alex is a fine man. You should hold him dear.”

###Chapter 159:
Sadie managed a smile, lowering her gaze to her plate, her emotions tangled.
Suddenly, a phone vibrated.
Alex retrieved his phone and glanced at the screen.
“Excuse me, I need to take this,” he said, standing and walking to the balcony to answer the call. “What’s up?”
His assistant’s voice came through clearly. “Mr. Howe, Mr. Wall’s Maybach followed Miss Hudson all the way to her home just now.”
Alex’s grip tightened on the phone, his knuckles whitening.
What was Noah planning?
“Got it,” Alex replied coldly before ending the call.
He inhaled deeply, attempting to quell the turmoil inside him, and returned to the dining table.
Sadie, sensing his distress, asked with concern, “Is everything alright? Is there a problem at your company?”
“It’s nothing. Just a minor issue,” Alex replied, managing a smile.
Sadie didn’t press further, though she felt uneasy.
The next day, as Sadie arrived at her studio, she sensed something was wrong. Before she could determine the cause, a burly man with an angry expression stormed into the studio.
“Sadie Hudson! Come out here!” he bellowed.
Heart racing, Sadie stepped forward. “Hello, I’m Sadie. What seems to be the problem?”
The man pointed accusingly at her. “You have the nerve to ask? Don’t you realize what you’ve done? You’re deceiving consumers! A designer like you disgraces the industry!”
Confused, Sadie responded, “Sir, please calm down and explain what’s happened.”
All the magic begins at g?lnσνs?com
“What’s happened? Stop pretending! The design drafts I commissioned have been leaked online! How can my company use them now?” The man slammed his phone down in front of Sadie, displaying the design drafts she had completed the day before. Sadie’s face blanched as she realized the implication.
The design drafts she’d finished had been leaked online today—someone was clearly trying to undermine her!
“Sir, please, don’t worry. I will investigate this immediately and provide you with an explanation,” Sadie assured him, striving to remain composed and alleviate the client’s fury.
“An explanation? How are you going to explain this? What am I supposed to do with my project now? Who will compensate for my losses?” The man was relentless, refusing to consider Sadie’s explanations.
“I’ll create new designs for you promptly, and I assure you they will meet your expectations. We still have time,” Sadie responded.
“It’s too late! I want to cancel the contract now! And you must compensate for my losses and pay a penalty, or I’ll take legal action!” The man was inflexible, leaving no room for negotiation. Sadie inhaled deeply.
After much effort, she managed to escort the man out of the studio. The office fell quiet, her colleagues watching her with mixed expressions.
She fought to maintain her composure, her mind racing to determine what had gone wrong.
She had been the only one to handle the design drafts yesterday… No, that wasn’t right.
There was another person—Byrum!
Yesterday, after completing the drafts, utterly exhausted, she had gone to the lounge to rest, leaving Byrum to handle the final details.

###Chapter 160:
Realizing this, Sadie scanned the office quickly.
Byrum was… nowhere to be found.
A chilling premonition washed over her, and her heart sank.
“Where’s Byrum? Why isn’t he here today?” she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.
A young designer timidly raised a hand, responding cautiously, “Miss Hudson, Byrum took a leave today, citing an emergency at home.”
“An emergency?” Sadie echoed, suspicion rising within her.
Byrum’s absence seemed too convenient.
“Did he mention when he’d return?” she pressed.
The young designer, clearly nervous under her scrutiny, stuttered, “N-no, he didn’t specify.”
Taking another deep breath, Sadie said, “Give me Byrum’s phone number.”
The designer quickly jotted down the number and handed it to her.
Sadie dialed immediately.noveldrama
It went unanswered.
Finally, an automated message stated, “Hello, the phone you dialed is turned off…”
Turned off?
Sadie’s heart sank deeper.
Determined, Sadie tried calling again, only to be met with the same result.
She instructed, “Does anyone here have other contact information for Byrum?”
Nothing came of Sadie’s efforts.
L€$? ￠t?€я? ?η ?@lи?νεl?.c?m
Sadie bit her lower lip hard, striving to maintain her composure. At this point, panic would serve no purpose.
“Call the police!” she commanded decisively. “Call them now!” Simultaneously, Sadie began urgently creating a new batch of drafts. Time was pressing, and every second was crucial.
She worked relentlessly, foregoing sleep and rest. Reassuring the clients was also essential. Handling the smaller clients proved manageable, but the larger ones, particularly Hank Lawrence, the CEO of Lawrence Group, posed the greatest challenge.
“Mr. Lawrence won’t see me?” Sadie massaged her temples, fatigue evident in her voice.
The assistant responded cautiously, “Yes, Miss Hudson. Mr. Lawrence’s secretary mentioned he’s been extremely busy and can’t spare time for a meeting.”
This was the third time Sadie had been rebuffed.
“Find out what Mr. Lawrence has been involved in lately! And check his social circles too!” she instructed.
Shortly after, the assistant returned with information. Hank’s wife, Leanna Lawrence, had her eye on a rare Hermes bag that was hard to acquire, even with ample funds.
An idea sparked in Sadie’s mind. Perhaps leveraging Leanna could provide a breakthrough.
“Contact the Hermes store,” she directed her assistant. “Tell them I need that bag, regardless of the cost.”
The assistant paused momentarily, then quickly grasped the urgency. “Okay, Miss Hudson, I’ll handle it immediately.”
The assistant was prompt, and by the next day, there was good news.
“Miss Hudson, it’s done!”
Sadie felt a wave of relief. Securing Hank’s order would provide the studio with much-needed stability.

###Chapter 161:
“Excellent, send me the address, and I’ll head there right away,” she responded.
Upon arriving at the Hermes store, Sadie encountered Isabel and Kyla. Their presence was unwelcome, like an ill omen.
Isabel, clad in opulent attire, lounged on the sofa while store employees showcased the latest handbags. Kyla stood elegantly beside Isabel, her smile poised and courteous. As soon as Isabel spotted Sadie, her expression soured, her eyes flashing with open disdain. The atmosphere became tense.
Taking a deep breath, Sadie, having already noticed them, strove to remain composed.
“Oh, isn’t this Sadie?” Isabel’s voice dripped with sarcasm. “I didn’t expect you to still be around after three years.”
“It’s been a long time, Mrs. Wall,” Sadie responded, keeping her voice even.
“Well?” Isabel sneered, eyeing Sadie contemptuously. “I thought you had disappeared. So, have you climbed another social ladder and decided it was safe to show your face again?”
“Please show some respect, Mrs. Wall,” Sadie countered, her own expression hardening. She was not the same person who could be easily intimidated like she was three years ago.
Isabel laughed mockingly. “You were ousted from the Wall family. What right do you have to demand respect from me? If it hadn’t been for Noah’s momentary lapse, did you really think you would have married into the Wall family?”
Sadie inhaled deeply, knowing arguing with Isabel was futile.
“Why the silence? Lost for words?” Isabel taunted. “What else can a woman like you do besides degrading yourself?”
Kyla attempted to intervene, tugging at Isabel’s sleeve and whispering, “Let it go. Don’t stoop to her level.”
Sadie scoffed coldly, fixing her gaze on Kyla. “You really have a heart of gold, Miss Wade. Anyone who doesn’t know better might think you’re a saint.”

“What do you mean?” Kyla’s face fell.
“You know exactly what I mean,” Sadie shot back. “Don’t assume your actions are a secret.”
“Damn you!” Kyla snapped, anger flaring.
Seeing Kyla flustered made Isabel even angrier. “You wretch, how dare you speak to Kyla that way!”
With that, Isabel raised her hand, aiming to slap Sadie.
But Sadie was prepared, smoothly stepping aside to dodge the slap and catching Isabel’s wrist in a firm grip.
“Please, Mrs. Wall, show some respect,” Sadie said icily.
Isabel hadn’t expected Sadie to retaliate. She winced as her wrist throbbed with pain.
Flushing with fury, she demanded, “Let go of me!”
A sales assistant, caught in the unfolding drama, rushed forward to intervene. “Ladies, please, let’s keep calm. This is a public place…” She found herself in a precarious position, caught between a member of the Wall family and the assertive Sadie, aware that she could not afford to offend either.
The assistant faltered, unsure of how to proceed.
Sadie, refocusing on her original intent, moved past Isabel. She addressed the sales assistant, her tone easing slightly. “Excuse me, could you please bring me the orange Kelly? I called ahead about it.”
Relieved, the assistant quickly brought the handbag and handed it respectfully to Sadie.
Isabel seethed as she observed Sadie’s composed manner. How could she stand being treated like this? Unable to accept the shift in their dynamics from three years ago, when Sadie was subservient to her, Isabel felt her anger intensify.
“Wait a minute!” Isabel called out sharply, pointing at the orange bag. “I want that bag. I’ll pay double.” noveldrama

###Chapter 162:
She slammed a black credit card onto the counter with force.
Kyla, trying to defuse the tension, suggested softly, “Sadie, since Mrs. Wall likes it, perhaps you could let her have it?”
Isabel immediately approved of Kyla’s words, patting her hand. “Kyla, you’re so sensible, unlike some who lack any sense of decency.” She shot a scornful look at Sadie.
Hearing their comments, Sadie scoffed. “Why should I? I chose this bag first.”
The sales assistant, caught in the middle, attempted to clarify. “Ma’am, this lady did choose the bag first…”
Isabel’s expression darkened. “If I want something, it should be mine. If I say I’m buying it, she should step aside.”
Undeterred, Sadie held Isabel’s glare. “I’ve already decided to purchase this bag. I’m not giving it up.”
She then handed her bank card to the sales assistant. “Please, proceed with the transaction.”
The sales assistant, eager to avoid any further commotion, quickly took Sadie’s card to process the payment.
Isabel, seething with anger, trembled as she pointed at Sadie. “You… you…” As Sadie neared her victory, Kyla was determined not to let her win easily. Scanning the area quickly, Kyla hatched a plan.
“Ow!” she exclaimed suddenly, stumbling toward Sadie.
Caught off guard, Sadie wobbled, nearly losing her grip on the bag.
In the nick of time, a strong arm encircled Sadie’s waist, steadying her.
“Careful!”
The deep, resonant voice was familiar in her ear.
Looking up, Sadie met Alex’s concerned eyes.
Meanwhile, Kyla, failing to regain her footing, fell to the floor with a pained moan.
“Kyla!” Isabel rushed over, helping her up. “Are you okay?”
Kyla clutched her ankle, wincing. “My ankle… I think I twisted it…”
Isabel shot an angry look at Sadie, her worry for Kyla turning into scorn. “You clumsy fool! Watch where you’re going! You’ve injured Kyla!”
Alex stepped in front of Sadie, his tone icy. “Mrs. Wall, please mind your words. It was Miss Wade who lost her balance first.”noveldrama
“You…” Isabel, overwhelmed with fury, struggled to find words. Sadie gently tugged at Alex’s sleeve, signaling him with a shake of her head.
She was tired of the endless disputes with these two women.
“Let’s leave,” she whispered softly.
Alex gave her a meaningful look but remained silent, escorting her as they turned to depart.
Kyla’s gaze followed them, a fleeting glint of malice in her eyes quickly giving way to an expression of feigned vulnerability.
“Who would have thought, after three years, Alex is still by Sadie’s side?” Kyla said pointedly, stressing “three years” as if to insinuate something deeper.
Isabel, already irate from Sadie’s resistance, felt her anger intensify at Kyla’s insinuation. She turned sharply, her tone accusatory. “Kyla, what are you implying? Was Alex… already involved with her three years ago?”
Isabel struggled to grasp the notion that the seemingly unassuming Sadie had been connected with Alex even back then.
To Isabel, Sadie was merely a gold digger who had married Noah for his wealth, and now, she suspected infidelity. Kyla cast her eyes downward, her long lashes concealing the cunning thoughts brewing within. She nibbled on her lip, appearing as though she was wrestling with whether to divulge more.

###Chapter 163:
“Tell me! What’s really going on?”
“Mrs. Wall, I heard… Three years ago, Alex frequently visited Sadie and seemed to often take care of her…”
“Care? What kind of care? When a man and a woman are alone, what could they be doing?!” Isabel erupted, her anger spilling over. “Noah must divorce her!”
Outside the mall, Alex’s concern was evident. “Sadie, are you alright?”
Sadie inhaled deeply, steadying herself, and mustered a weak smile. “I’m fine.”
They walked in silence until Sadie broke it. “How did you find me here?”
Alex paused, then chose honesty. “I saw the news about your studio’s designs being leaked online. I was concerned about you, so I came to see if you were alright. Your assistant mentioned you were at Hermes… What happened?”
Sadie chuckled dryly. “The usual schemes. But I won’t be brought down so easily.”
Isabel’s words echoed in her mind, causing a sharp pain in her heart. “Get in the car. I’ll take you home,” Alex offered softly, pulling Sadie from her reverie.
Sadie nodded, slipped into the car, and closed the door behind her. The ride home was quiet.
Breaking the silence, Sadie suddenly asked, “Alex, do you know where Mrs. Lawrence often goes?”
Alex blinked, surprised by the question. “Mrs. Lawrence? The wife of the Lawrence Group CEO?” Sadie nodded in confirmation.
“I heard she’s quite fond of limited-edition handbags, and I happen to have one she’s been searching for. I thought I’d try my luck and see if I can meet with her.”
“I do know a few of her favorite spots…” Alex shared a list of places, which Sadie noted carefully.
Over the next few days, Sadie embarked on a thorough quest, visiting each venue Alex mentioned, hoping for a chance encounter. Her determination paid off. At a high-end art gallery, she finally crossed paths with Leanna.
New adventures await at g?lnσνs﹒o
“Mrs. Lawrence, hello. I’m Sadie,” Sadie introduced herself with polite assertiveness.noveldrama
Leanna gave her a brief look, her response brusque. “I know who you are, the one whose designs have been leaked. If this is about work, you should speak with my husband.”
Her voice was frosty, signaling her lack of interest in further discussion. Taking a deep breath to steady her nerves, Sadie produced the Hermes bag.
“I heard you appreciate this style, so I brought it for you.”
Leanna’s attention shifted to the bag, her expression revealing a hint of surprise, though she quickly masked it. She checked her watch.
“I’ll give you five minutes.”
Sadie’s excitement grew.
“Mrs. Lawrence, in addition to this bag, I have another gift for you,” Sadie continued with composure, retrieving a design portfolio from her bag.
“I’m truly sorry about the leak. To rectify that and to demonstrate my sincerity, I’ve created new drafts and also crafted an extra set…” She paused, gauging Leanna’s reaction. Seeing no interruption, she continued. “I understand that your ten-year wedding anniversary with Mr. Lawrence is approaching, and I’ve taken the liberty of designing a special collection to mark the occasion. I hope these can serve as a token of my apologies and goodwill from my studio.”
Leanna finally showed some interest. She picked up the portfolio and began flipping through its pages. With each page turned, Sadie’s heart raced faster.
The portfolio was the culmination of her tireless efforts over the past few days. When Leanna finished, she placed the portfolio back on the table, her expression unreadable.

###Chapter 164:
“Nice designs.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Lawrence.” A spark of hope ignited in Sadie’s chest.
“These designs not only fulfill Mr. Lawrence’s specifications, but I’ve also introduced some innovative ideas… They were inspired by the love story between you and Mr. Lawrence, symbolizing a decade of companionship and commitment. I hope they resonate as more than just jewelry, but as a testament to your journey together.”
For the first time, a shift appeared in Leanna’s composed demeanor. Her eyes lingered, and her fingers gently caressed the cover of the portfolio, as if touching a fond memory. “How… how did you know all this?”
Sadie gave a modest smile. “As a designer, understanding the stories behind my clients enriches my work. Your story with Mr. Lawrence, while not widely known, isn’t exactly hidden. I did some research.”
Leanna looked at Sadie more intently, her expression becoming more complex. The room’s atmosphere tensed.
After a significant pause, Leanna exhaled softly, a subtle but genuine smile appearing on her lips. “You’re very clever, and you’re very thoughtful.”
Relief washed over Sadie, calming her rapid heartbeat.
“Thank you for the compliment, Mrs. Lawrence.”
“I really like these designs.” Leanna’s expression softened, showing a hint of appreciation. “Considering your sincerity, I won’t hold the leak against you.”noveldrama
“Thank you so much!” Sadie nearly leapt from her spot in excitement but quickly regained her composure.
“As for my husband…” Leanna continued. “I’ll speak to him. What happens next… well, that’s in the hands of fate.”
Leanna’s reassurance brought immense relief to Sadie. The encounter had gone smoother than she had anticipated, and the weight she had been carrying was finally lifted.
gα?ησν?s?com takes you on a journey
“Mrs. Lawrence, I won’t take up more of your time,” Sadie said as she stood, giving Leanna a respectful nod before leaving the VIP room. Upon her return to the studio, an employee approached immediately, her expression laden with worry. “Sadie, how did it go? What did Mr. Lawrence say?”
Sadie waved off the concern with a tired gesture and sank into a chair, pressing her fingers against her temples to ease the tension. “It’s resolved. Mrs. Lawrence won’t push the issue any further.”
Relief washed over the employees, smiles breaking across their faces. “That’s fantastic! Sadie, I knew you could handle it.” However, the sense of relief was short-lived.
Before Sadie could fully embrace her moment of respite, she felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her chest.
“This isn’t over yet,” she said gravely, dampening the brief jubilation around her.
“What? Sadie, didn’t Mrs. Lawrence say she’d drop it?”
“The issue with the design drafts is settled, but we can’t just let this slide,” Sadie said, massaging her forehead, visibly drained. “We need to find out who leaked the designs, or we’ll continue facing problems.” She stood and walked over to the window, lost in thought.
It had been days since she’d had a proper night’s sleep, leaving her physically and mentally exhausted. She had reported the incident to the police, but so far, they had no leads.
After a moment of contemplation, she picked up her phone and dialed a number.
“Hello, it’s me. I need to hire you for an investigation.”
A deep, reassuring voice responded from the other end, “Miss Hudson, please proceed.”
“It’s about the leak of my studio’s design drafts.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 165:
Sadie detailed the situation. “I need you to find the source of the leak and identify the person responsible.”
“Please rest assured, Miss Hudson. We will conduct a thorough investigation and provide you with results as soon as possible.” After she ended the call, Sadie’s heart remained heavy.
Sadie hadn’t slept a wink that night, her thoughts dominated by the leak of the design drafts.
The following morning, a knock sounded at the studio door. “Sadie, someone from the Lawrence Group is here,” an employee informed her.
Taken aback for a moment, Sadie quickly rose, adjusted her clothing, took a deep breath, and opened the door.
A man in a sharp suit and gold-rimmed glasses stood at the threshold, a document folder in hand and a professional smile on his face. “Good morning, Miss Hudson. I’m Edgar White, Mr. Lawrence’s assistant.”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. White. What brings you here?” Sadie inquired.
“Mr. Lawrence has sent me to deliver this to you,” Edgar replied, presenting the folder.
Taking the folder with a mix of curiosity and apprehension, Sadie opened it to discover a proposal for a partnership.
“Mr. Lawrence mentioned that if you can handle this public relations issue effectively, the Lawrence Group would be open to renewing collaboration with you,” Edgar explained. “Moreover, Mrs. Lawrence has expressed a high regard for your designs.”
Sadie felt a surge of excitement at this unexpected opportunity.
“Mr. White, please extend my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Lawrence for his trust and support. I am committed to resolving this crisis and eager to work with the Lawrence Group once more,” she said, her voice tinged with excitement.

After Edgar departed, Sadie quickly convened a meeting with her team.
“Good news! Lawrence Group is interested in renewing our collaboration.”
Cheers erupted throughout the studio.
“That’s fantastic, Sadie!”
“We can definitely overcome this challenge.”
“Let’s give it our all!”
As the team celebrated, Sadie’s phone, which lay on the table, vibrated.noveldrama
She picked it up and saw it was the private detective she had hired.
She swiped to answer. “Hello?”
“Miss Hudson, we’ve located Byrum,” the detective said in a low, serious tone. “He’s currently hiding in a rundown neighborhood in the west of the city. I’ve sent the exact address to your phone.”
A rundown neighborhood in the west of the city—known for its dubious reputation—implied Byrum likely felt guilty.
“Thank you, I’ve received it,” Sadie said, taking a deep breath. “I’ll head over as soon as I can.”
After ending the call, Sadie faced her team, managing a smile. “Everyone, please stay focused here. I have an urgent matter to attend to. Sonia, I’ll leave the studio in your care.”
“Sadie, what’s going on?” Sonia Torres asked, concern in her voice, while the others looked on curiously.
Sadie hesitated, then chose transparency. “I’ve found Byrum’s location. I need to go and get some answers.” The room tensed immediately.
“Sadie, it’s too risky for you to go alone.” Sonia expressed her worry. “Let us come with you!”
“Yes, Sadie. There’s strength in numbers.”

###Chapter 166:
Sadie shook her head. “I appreciate your concern, but this is something I must do on my own. Don’t worry, I’ll be careful.”
Resolving the issue with Byrum quickly was crucial; delays could complicate things further.
In a dilapidated rental house in the west of the city, Byrum’s voice was obsequious and urgent. “Hello, Miss Wade, about the final payment…”noveldrama
On the other end, Kyla’s voice carried clear impatience. “Why are you still there? Didn’t we agree you’d leave immediately after the job was done?”
Byrum stammered, “I don’t have the money for a plane ticket. Miss Wade, about the final payment…”
Kyla let out a sneer. “Once you’re out of the country, the payment will be transferred.”
Byrum started to panic. “Miss Wade, you can’t do this. What if I get caught and expose everything?”
“Don’t you dare!” Kyla snapped back fiercely. “If you breathe a word, I’ll make sure you regret it.”
Byrum’s complexion turned ashen.
“Bang! Bang! Bang!” Loud knocking suddenly echoed, intensifying the already strained atmosphere.
Byrum thought it might be a food delivery.
He opened the door, only to find himself face-to-face with a familiar and intimidating figure: Sadie.
“You… How did you find me?” Byrum stood frozen in shock.
Sadie’s expression was stoic. “Byrum, why did you betray me?”
L?t?st ?hαpt?rs in glnovl.o
In a desperate move, Byrum shoved Sadie aside and bolted.
“Freeze!” Sadie yelled, taking off after him.
She quickly pulled out her phone and dialed the police. “Hello, 911? I need assistance with a fugitive here. Please send officers immediately…”
As Byrum ran, he darted onto a deserted street, his panic escalating.
“Even if you catch me, so what? Got any proof? Can you prove I was the one who leaked the designs?” Byrum taunted over his shoulder, laughing wildly as he ran.
Sadie chased Byrum onto the highway. Suddenly, a black car appeared, speeding towards them. Byrum had no chance to react before it struck him, sending him flying through the air.
“Ah!” Sadie let out a horrified scream.
The incident unfolded so quickly that she was left stunned. Byrum was now lying still, surrounded by blood. Shock overcame Sadie, and a piercing noise filled her ears.
At that moment, the black car spun out of control after smashing into the roadside barrier, heading straight for Sadie. Reality hit Sadie; she tried to move, but her legs wouldn’t respond.
Just then, a silver-gray Maybach charged across the highway.
“Hit it now!” Noah’s voice cut through the chaos, icy and decisive.
He was passing by just as the accident occurred. The driver looked terrified.
“Mr. Wall, it’s too risky!”
“Just do it!” Noah demanded, his gaze fixed on the black sedan about to hit Sadie.
With no time to spare, the driver swerved dramatically, and the Maybach slammed into the black car with tremendous force.
“Bang!” The sound of the crash thundered through the air.
The violent collision knocked Sadie out, and everything went dark for her. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 167:
Ignoring everything else, Noah leapt from the Maybach and scooped up Sadie, who was lying unconscious. “Sadie! Sadie!”
Her face was pale, devoid of any color, and the wound on her forehead was bleeding. Noah’s heart felt heavy with dread.
“Get us to a hospital, fast!” he shouted as he carried Sadie back to the Maybach.noveldrama
The driver, deeply shaken, quickly started the car and sped towards the nearest hospital.
Noah burst through the hospital doors, Sadie in his arms. The smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air as the bright lights of the emergency room bore down.
Outside the emergency room, Noah paced, fraught with worry. “Doctor, what’s her condition?” Noah asked urgently as the doctor emerged.
With a calm expression, the doctor removed his mask and replied, “She’s not seriously injured. The shock and fear caused her to faint. We’ve treated the wound on her forehead. She needs rest now.”
A sense of relief washed over Noah. “Thank you, doctor.”
He pushed open the hospital room door and approached Sadie’s bedside, observing her in silence.
“Alex…” Sadie murmured faintly, breaking the silence.
Noah’s face clouded over instantly, his hands clenched tightly, his knuckles whitening.
He left the room without saying a word.
Stopping at the doorway, Noah took a deep breath and pulled out his phone to call Samuel.
“Samuel, manage the aftermath of the car accident. Keep it quiet, no media leaks,” he instructed, pausing briefly before continuing, “And gather all the recent information on Sadie. I want every detail.”
“Will do, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded respectfully on the other end.

After hanging up, Noah exited the hospital, not looking back.
Back in the room, Sadie’s eyelashes twitched as she slowly regained consciousness.
“Water…” Her voice was hoarse and weak.
“You’re awake, Sadie,” a gentle voice filled with underlying tension said near her.
Sadie blinked open her eyes, her vision gradually focusing on Alex’s worried face.
“Alex, was it you who rescued me?” she asked, her eyes brimming with gratitude as she gripped his hand.
Alex was momentarily taken aback, remembering that when he arrived earlier, he had seen Noah leaving.
In the end, Alex responded while holding Sadie’s hand, “I’m just relieved you’re safe…”
Elsewhere, Kyla was pacing worriedly.
She fumed over Byrum’s foolishness. He had actually managed to get himself killed in a car accident.
Kyla had only intended for Byrum to undermine Sadie. Who could have imagined it would end his life?
“That’s good news, actually…” she murmured under her breath, a sinister smile forming on her pale face. “The dead don’t speak.”
She could not let this incident trace back to her.
Just then, a gentle knock sounded at the office door. Samuel stood at the entrance, his posture respectful. “Miss Wade—Wall has requested to see you.”
Kyla felt her chest tighten, but she masked her anxiety with a composed expression. “Got it,” she replied smoothly, taking a deep breath to calm her rising panic.
She followed Samuel to Noah’s office, where she immediately noticed him sitting on the sofa, a glass of red wine in hand, swirling it thoughtfully.

###Chapter 168:
“Noah, you wanted to see me?” she inquired softly, her voice carrying a hint of flirtation as she took a seat beside him.
Noah placed the wine glass down, his intense gaze fixed on her. “How much do you know about Byrum?” he inquired.
Kyla’s heart skipped a beat, but she maintained a facade of surprise. “Byrum? Who is he? Is something wrong? Don’t frighten me like that.”
Noah’s expression remained unchanged. “He’s dead. Hit by a car.”noveldrama
“What?!” Kyla covered her mouth, feigning shock. “That’s horrible! How could such a thing happen?” She shivered, simulating distress.
“The police ruled it an accident, but…” Noah paused, his eyes narrowing slightly. “It seems he was trying to contact you before he died.”
Kyla’s complexion paled, but she struggled to appear composed. “Contact me? I’m not sure why. Maybe because I once helped him secure a job.”
“Is that so?” Noah’s lips twisted into a faint, skeptical smile as he observed her.
Kyla swallowed hard, forcing a smile. “Noah, are you suspecting me? How could I possibly—”
“Kyla.” Noah interrupted her. “I need you to understand that I do not tolerate deception.”
His intense gaze made it difficult for Kyla to maintain her composure, but years of honing her deceitful skills helped her quickly recover.
Tears welled up, her eyes reddening as she put on a pitiful look. “Noah, do you truly suspect me? Byrum and I barely knew each other. How could I possibly…”
Kyla paused, taking a deep breath.
“I know you’re upset because of what happened to Sadie, but… have you forgotten who saved you back then? If not for me, you…” Her voice faltered, tears spilling over as her tone became more distraught. “I’ve done so much for you, and yet you…”
M  ? .
She covered her face, her shoulders trembling as she cried.
She was gambling that Noah’s sense of guilt and the memories of her past assistance would sway his judgment.
Noah watched her cry, his expression complex, and remained silent.
The room was heavy with tension.
After a lengthy silence, he finally spoke, his voice low and firm. “Leave.”
The door closed softly behind Kyla.
Once he was alone, Noah’s indifferent facade disappeared.
He picked up a file from the table, gripping it so tightly that the edges crumpled.
It contained detailed records of every collusion between Kyla and Byrum, including the leak of the design drafts from Sadie’s studio.
“Samuel,” he called out sharply.
Samuel entered the room promptly. “Mr. Wall.”
“Take care of this situation and make Byrum bear all the blame. Also, contact Sadie’s studio. Inform them that Wall Group is interested in a collaboration.”
“Mr. Wall…” Samuel hesitated. “Byrum is—I…”
Noah’s icy stare cut him off. “Understood. I’ll see to it immediately.”
As Sadie slowly regained consciousness in the ward, a tender voice pierced the silence.
“Mommy!”
A small figure jumped onto the hospital bed. It was Averi.
His tiny hand gently touched Sadie’s cheek, his big eyes brimming with concern. “Mommy, you really scared me. Please don’t leave me again, okay?”
Sadie’s heart melted at his words. She embraced Averi tightly and kissed his forehead softly. 
.

###Chapter 169:
“I’m sorry, sweetheart, for making you worry. I promise I won’t leave you again.”
Alex, observing this tender moment, felt a twinge of sorrow. He had taken care of the discharge formalities.
“Sadie, the doctor said you’re all set to go home now. I’ve arranged for a car to take us.”
“Thank you, Alex.”
“It’s nothing, Sadie.” Alex smiled warmly as he lifted Averi. “Let’s go, little guy. We’ll take Mommy home.”
The drive back was smooth, with Sadie holding Averi, resting against the seat, fatigued but relieved.
As soon as the car pulled into the driveway, Sadie’s phone rang.
“Miss Hudson, I have great news!” Pierre Ballard, Sadie’s assistant, could hardly contain his excitement. “The online rumors have completely subsided. Everyone now believes Byrum was solely responsible, clearing our name.”
A wave of relief washed over Sadie, easing her nerves.
“What about our partnerships? Are they reinstated?”
“They are, and even better,” Pierre said. “Mr. Lawrence from Lawrence Group personally reached out to apologize for the misunderstanding and affirmed their commitment to strengthen our partnership. And there’s even more exciting news. Several prominent companies that were previously on the fence are now keen to work with us. Miss Hudson, your resilience has really paid off!”
Sadie’s hand trembled with emotion as she clutched the phone, overwhelmed by the turn of events.
The rapid resolution of the situation couldn’t solely be attributed to Byrum’s exposure.
Sadie knew someone must have been orchestrating things behind the scenes.
gα?ησν?s? brings great stories
Instinctively, she turned to Alex, her eyes conveying deep gratitude. “Thank you so much, Alex.”
Alex cleared his throat, his smile slightly awkward. “It was nothing, really.”
Convinced of her suspicions, Sadie felt a surge of appreciation. “Alex, why don’t you come up for dinner? I’d like to make something simple to thank you for all your help.”
After a brief hesitation, Alex agreed. “Alright.”
The three of them went upstairs together.
Post-dinner, Alex departed, and after putting Averi to bed, Sadie lay down but found sleep elusive.
The following morning, Sadie arrived at the studio early.
“Good morning, Miss Hudson.” Pierre greeted her with palpable enthusiasm. “Great news! I stayed late last night and finalized all our partnerships. The contracts are signed, and we’re ready to start coordinating today.”
“Thank you for your hard work, Pierre,” Sadie responded, her voice filled with relief.
“It’s my pleasure, really. It’s what I’m here for,” Pierre replied, clapping his hands excitedly. “This was a team effort.”
As the initial excitement diminished, Pierre’s demeanor shifted, showing hesitation. “Miss Hudson, there’s one more thing…”
“What is it?”
“It’s about Wall Group…” Pierre said cautiously. “They’ve requested that you handle the negotiations personally…”
Sadie’s smile faded slightly.
Wall Group, Noah…
“Why would… Why do they…” Her voice faltered as she picked up the collaboration proposal, her fingers quickly flipping through the pages until she saw “Wall Group” emblazoned across the document. noveldrama

###Chapter 170:
Sadie never expected Wall Group, a giant in the industry, to offer a partnership with her budding studio.noveldrama
Just the previous day, her excitement had been so overwhelming that she neglected to inquire about the crucial detail—who were their partners?
“Exactly, Miss Hudson! Wall Group! It’s the kind of chance most can only imagine,” Pierre exclaimed, unaware of the change in her expression. “Our studio could skyrocket to incredible success with this deal!”
An unseen force seemed to constrict Sadie’s chest, making it difficult to breathe.
Wall Group. That implied Noah was involved.
After painstakingly rebuilding her life after her divorce, the last thing she wanted was any reconnection with him.
Sadie said with a strained voice, “Pierre, about this partnership… is it possible… to back out?”
Pierre’s smile vanished.
“Back out? Miss Hudson, are you serious? We’re talking about Wall Group here!”
“I understand… but…” Sadie inhaled sharply. “It just doesn’t seem right for us. The penalty… can we afford it?” she asked, getting straight to the point.
Pierre’s expression darkened. “The penalty… unfortunately, it’s beyond our means…”
Sadie shut her eyes, taking another deep breath to steady herself.
Noticing Sadie’s distressed look, Pierre grasped the gravity of his mistake. His voice shook as he murmured, “Miss Hudson… I’m so sorry… I thought this was an opportunity…”
“That’s alright, Pierre. I need to be alone to think this through.”
Relieved yet regretful, Pierre hurriedly exited the office.

Silence enveloped the room as Sadie remained alone, clutching the collaboration document so tightly that her nails threatened to pierce the paper.
With eyes closed, she allowed herself a moment of respite.
When she reopened her eyes, they had a newfound clarity. Sadie knew avoidance was no longer an option. She had to confront the issue, even if it was the last thing she wanted to do. Taking a deep breath, she picked up her bag, resolved. She exited the studio and made her way directly to Wall Group.
The bustling grand lobby of Wall Group was filled with rushing people, but Sadie’s arrival seemed to stop them in their tracks.
“Is that… Sadie?” someone murmured.
“Yes, that’s her! Wasn’t she supposed to…?”
“Three years gone, and just like that, she returns?” Speculations began to swirl around the lobby like wildfire.
At that moment, Tina stepped out of the elevator, and when her eyes landed on Sadie, the file she was holding dropped with a loud clang. Her expression was one of pure shock.
“Sa… Sadie?”
Spotting Tina, Sadie managed a weak smile. “Tina.”
Rushing forward, Tina grasped Sadie’s arm, inspecting her closely. “It really is you! What happened these past three years? We all assumed you were… ”
Her voice trailed off, leaving the unspoken thought lingering in the air. With a fleeting shadow crossing her face, Sadie responded lightly, “I needed some time alone to sort things out.”
“To sort things out? For three years?” Tina’s skepticism was obvious.
“What’s the real story, Sadie?”
“Let’s not dwell on the past,” Sadie said, her voice soft but firm. She had no desire to revisit those difficult years, especially not within the walls of Wall Group.

###Chapter 171:
“But…” Tina began, eager to get more details, only to be silenced by Sadie’s determined look.
“I’m here today because I have something to take care of,” Sadie said, quickly changing the subject.
“What’s the matter?” Tina’s tone was laced with concern.
“It’s about…” Sadie paused for a moment. “About a collaboration.”
Upon hearing what Sadie said, Tina eagerly pulled her along. “Come on, Sadie, let’s head to the meeting room first. I’ll call the person in charge right away.”
Guided by Tina, Sadie entered the elevator, feeling the weight in her heart increase with each floor they ascended. To her, Wall Group was less about business and more like a source of personal anguish.
The elevator doors opened, and Tina led Sadie directly to the designated meeting room.
“Here we are.” Tina pushed open the door, only to halt abruptly at the sight of the occupant inside.
Kyla was there, casually browsing through some documents. She was dressed in a pale-yellow suit that accentuated her flawless skin and elegant demeanor. Upon hearing the door, Kyla looked up. When she spotted Sadie, her expression stiffened, and the documents she held tumbled to the floor.
“You…” Kyla started, her voice laced with surprise and irritation.
Tina, too, seemed surprised, momentarily speechless.
The room was filled with tension instantly.
“Miss Wade, Sadie is here to discuss a potential collaboration,” Tina finally stated.
Before Tina could continue, Kyla interrupted with a scornful laugh. “Sadie, you’ve got some nerve. Do you even understand your position, coming here to propose a partnership with Wall Group?”
Tina shifted uncomfortably, unsure how to manage the situation.
“Miss Wade, I am here on behalf of my studio to discuss professional matters, not personal issues. My qualifications are not up for your judgment,” Sadie responded coolly, which seemed to aggravate Kyla even more.
Kyla stepped closer, her voice low and biting. “Stop the act!” she snapped. “Are you here trying to rekindle old flames? Just don’t even think about it.”
A mocking smile flickered across Sadie’s face as she met Kyla’s glare with a chilling gaze.
“Miss Wade, you seem very interested in my personal life. It appears your feelings for Mr. Wall are quite intense.”
“Damn you!” Kyla’s face reddened with anger.
“Stop being so sarcastic! Do you really think you can come between Noah and me? Dream on!”
“Come between you? Is that necessary?” Sadie responded coolly.
“You…” Kyla was at a loss for words, her frustration evident. With a final glare, she stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind her.
The room quieted, leaving only Sadie and Tina.
After a few seconds of silence, Tina cautiously asked, “Sadie, are you… okay?”
“I’m fine. This isn’t new to me.”
Sadie had expected this kind of reaction from Kyla.
Tina looked at her, hesitating before voicing her curiosity. “So… you and Mr. Wall…”
“There’s nothing between us.” Sadie cut her off sharply.
Tina exhaled softly.
“When Miss Wade came back from abroad three years ago, everyone thought they were getting married. After all, Mr. Wall is influential, and she’s attractive—they seemed perfect for each other.”

###Chapter 172:noveldrama
After a brief pause, she added, “Everyone expected Mr. Wall to propose to Miss Wade soon.”
“Is that so?” Sadie replied, her voice detached, signaling her disinterest.
“Yes,” Tina continued, lost in the gossip. “It’s strange, three years and nothing has happened…”
Inside, Sadie felt turmoil, but she maintained her composure. “Perhaps they have their reasons,” she suggested, ready to focus on the business at hand and leave the past—and the rumors—behind.
Just then, the door to the meeting room swung open.
Noah walked in.
He was dressed in a perfectly tailored black suit, accentuating his tall, lean figure and making him appear even more imposing. His face was expressionless.
Tina’s face drained of color at the sight of him. She hurriedly stood up, stammering, “M-Mr. Wall.”
“Leave,” Noah said in a cold tone, his gaze fixed on Sadie.
Tina quickly exited the room, making sure to close the door behind her. Now alone with Noah, Sadie felt a chill. She had anticipated a meeting with someone from the marketing department, not expecting the CEO of Wall Group himself to attend.
“For such a minor collaboration, it’s really an honor for you to attend personally, Mr. Wall,” Sadie said, her voice laced with subtle sarcasm.
Noah’s expression darkened. He had overheard Sadie’s conversation with Tina just outside the door. Three years had not changed her; she still maintained that nonchalant, composed demeanor. This indifference ignited an uncomfortable feeling within him.
“You misunderstood,” Noah replied, his voice steady but firm. “Wall Group handles all partnerships with rigorous scrutiny, no exceptions.”
“Exceptions?” Sadie felt a sting in her chest. Yes, exceptions were only meant for Kyla, right? She took a deep breath to quell the rising emotions within her, then pulled out a chair and sat down.

“So, Mr. Wall, what type of design are you envisioning?”
Noah’s gaze was unreadable.
“This project is critical for Wall Group’s future, and it necessitates a deeper collaboration. I want you to start working at Wall Group tomorrow to streamline communication about the project.”
“Working at Wall Group?” Sadie laughed. He wanted her to work at Wall Group? Was this invitation for convenience in collaboration, for oversight, or perhaps… to keep her close as a form of control?
She began to gather her belongings, preparing to leave. “Have you considered the penalty for breaching the contract?” Noah’s voice remained even, yet carried an authoritative tone.
Sadie’s hand paused in mid-motion, a surge of anger flooding through her. The penalty! Given the current financial constraints of her studio, affording any penalties was out of the question.
With reluctance, Sadie turned back around. “Fine. I agree,” she said through gritted teeth, each word a struggle to get out.
As she turned to leave, Noah spoke up. “It’s almost lunchtime.”
Expecting him to delve further into project specifics, Sadie was taken aback when he instead mentioned lunch. She paused, then gave a bitter smile. “Mr. Wall, I assume you’ll be having lunch with Miss Wade? I wouldn’t want to intrude.”
Noah’s brow furrowed, his displeasure evident at her tone. “The business discussion isn’t over, and lunch can be part of that discussion too.”
A wave of frustration welled up inside Sadie. Was she just a pawn to him, to be used and dismissed at his convenience?

###Chapter 173:
“Sorry, Mr. Wall, I have another appointment.”
Noah’s piercing gaze locked on her, trying to gauge her sincerity. “With whom?”
Sadie said, “That’s not your concern, is it? We’re merely business partners. My personal life is none of your business.”
Noah’s expression darkened. “Sadie, remember, we’re discussing a collaboration here. Do you realize what partnering with Wall Group could mean for your studio? Are you really willing to risk this opportunity over a mere lunch?” His voice held a warning edge.
Sadie clenched her fists. Noah was using their business collaboration as leverage to manipulate her!
Sadie inhaled sharply, grappling with the reality that she had no real say in the matter. “Alright, I agree.”
At that, Noah’s lips twisted into a smug smile. He then strode toward the elevator. In silence, Sadie trailed after him, feeling his dominance overshadow her independence. As they approached the elevator, its doors parted slowly, revealing Kyla stepping out.
Kyla’s face lit up with a joyful smile when she saw Noah, completely ignoring Sadie. She quickly hooked her arm through his.
“Noah, how about lunch together? I’ve booked a table at your favorite place.”noveldrama
With a casual motion, Noah detached his arm. “No, I’ll pass.” For a moment, Kyla’s smile faltered, and it was only then she seemed to become aware of Sadie just behind Noah. Her eyes flashed coldly before she adopted a gracious demeanor.
“Very well then. Sadie, you can borrow Noah for the time being.” She stressed the word “borrow,” infusing it with disdain.
Internally, Sadie scoffed but maintained a stoic facade. Uninterested in Kyla’s petty taunts, Sadie stepped into the elevator without responding. Kyla’s smile tightened. She hadn’t anticipated such a dismissive response from Sadie. Anger welled up within her. She was determined not to let Sadie, that detestable woman, win Noah over.
As the elevator doors sealed shut, they obscured Kyla’s resentful stare. Inside, Sadie drew a deep breath once more.

They arrived at the underground parking lot, where Noah exited first, followed closely by Sadie. The two walked in tense silence, the emotional weight between them almost suffocating.
Noah’s car, a sleek black Maybach, stood out with its understated luxury. He opened the door, gesturing for Sadie to enter. Buckling herself in, Sadie settled comfortably into the passenger seat. The parking lot faded behind them as Noah ignited the engine and pulled away.
They came to a stop outside a trendy bistro, and Noah escorted Sadie through its doors. Inside, the restaurant radiated elegance, its soft lighting enveloping the space in a cozy ambiance. They were led by a server to a window-side table where menus awaited them.
Noah promptly ordered from memory, choosing dishes Sadie once adored, without so much as a glance at the menu. Gazing upon the array of familiar dishes stirred a tempest of emotions within Sadie. Bittersweet memories, once cherished, now tinged her thoughts with irony.
“You…” began Sadie, her voice faltering briefly as she broached the heavy topic. “When can we finalize our divorce?”
Noah’s cutlery hung in the air, his expression briefly betraying his surprise. He looked up, his gaze landing on Sadie’s calm face.
“What’s the rush?” asked Noah, a wry smile touching his lips, his words edged with a hint of scorn. “Is it because you’re in a hurry to wed Alex?”
A wave of disappointment washed over Sadie; she hadn’t expected him to see her in such a light.
The abrupt ring of a phone pierced the mounting tension. With a slight frown, Noah retrieved his phone from his pocket and eyed the caller ID. Silently, Sadie observed the changes flickering across his face, emotions she couldn’t quite name swirling within her.

###Chapter 174:
“Hello?” Noah spoke into the phone.
Kyla’s frail voice responded, her tone quivering with distress, “Noah, I… I’m feeling terrible…” She gasped, her voice breaking. “My chest… it hurts so badly… Can you come and take me to the hospital?”
Noah hesitated for a moment, his indecision palpable even over the phone. Kyla, sensing his hesitation, sounded even more aggrieved. “Noah, have you forgotten what you promised me?” Noah took a deep breath. “I’ll be back right away.” He ended the call and turned to Sadie. “Kyla isn’t feeling well. I have to go back.”
Sadie remained silent, her gaze steady on him. She felt no need to respond. Kyla’s wellbeing was not her concern.
“Sadie…” Noah started, as if he wanted to explain further, but then he stopped himself. He stood up, collected his coat, and left the restaurant without another glance.
Sadie watched him leave, feeling a chill settle over her heart. It was clear as ever; Kyla was always his priority. And she, Sadie, was just a temporary fill-in.
With Noah gone, the fine dishes before her lost all appeal. She took a sip of water, settled the bill, and left.
Meanwhile, Noah drove back to the Wall Group headquarters. In the CEO’s office on the top floor, Kyla was anxiously waiting on the sofa. Her face brightened when Noah entered. She rushed to him, wrapping her arms around his neck. “Noah, you’re back!” But Noah’s face was grim.
He gently but firmly pushed Kyla away. “What’s going on?”
Kyla, taken aback by his stern tone, faltered and said, “I… I wasn’t feeling well earlier…”
“Go to the hospital,” he said coldly.
Kyla’s expression revealed her guilt as her eyes darted around nervously. “Noah, actually… I’m feeling much better now. No need for a hospital visit.”
Your storytelling begins at g α? ησ ν s, com
She watched Noah’s expression carefully, her voice tentative. “I—I hope I didn’t interrupt your meal with Sadie, did I?”
Noah’s brow furrowed, and he gripped her wrist a bit too sharply. “Kyla, I’ve tolerated a lot from you, but don’t cross my bottom line.” Kyla stiffened. Bottom line? Did he mean Sadie? Kyla’s heart burned with resentment. Tears welled up in her eyes as she whispered, “Noah, you’re hurting me.”
Noah abruptly released her wrist. “If you pull that stunt again, you won’t have a place here.”
Kyla’s face flushed with a mix of anger and humiliation. “Noah, I’m sorry…” Her voice trembled, and tears filled her eyes. “I promise it won’t happen again.”noveldrama
Despite her tearful, pitiful appearance, Noah remained stoic. He didn’t spare her another glance as he turned and walked out of the office.
Bang! The door slammed shut behind him.
Kyla clenched her fists tightly. “Sadie! Always Sadie!” she hissed through gritted teeth, her voice seething with venom. “Why did you come back? How do you always manage to survive?”
She abruptly stood up and began pacing the office in agitated steps. “And that child…” Kyla suddenly stopped. “Noah must never find out about that child’s existence! Absolutely not!”
Sadie returned to her studio. Pierre immediately approached her. “Miss Hudson, are you okay?”
Sadie offered a faint smile. “I’m fine. The partnership is secure.”
“That’s great,” Pierre said, relief evident in his voice.
Sadie walked over to her desk and sat down, starting to pack up. “Starting tomorrow, I’ll be at Wall Group for a while. If there’s anything you’re unsure about, just call me anytime.”
Sadie rubbed her temples after giving her assistant instructions, trying to soothe the persistent ache. The fatigue from the recent days overwhelmed her, urging her just to go home and collapse. She picked up her bag and left the studio.

###Chapter 175:
“Sadie, let me drive you,” a familiar voice offered from beside her.
Looking up, she saw Alex by his car, parked at the curb, watching her intently.
“That’s kind of you, but I’ll take a cab.” She declined politely, not wanting to be a burden.
“It’s late, and it’s not safe to be out alone. Please, get in,” Alex insisted. After hesitating, Sadie nodded, opened the passenger door, and climbed in.
“You don’t have to chauffeur me anymore, Alex. It’s too much trouble for you,” she murmured, buckling up.
As Alex started the car, his face showed concern and something else he kept hidden. “You’re going to work at Wall Group?”
“Yes, it’s a joint project. I couldn’t say no,” Sadie responded, her voice filled with reluctance.
“Sadie…” Alex started, then stopped, his hands tightening on the steering wheel. He knew too well the hurt Noah had caused her. The prospect of her facing that old torment bothered him.
“I know what you’re worried about, Alex,” Sadie said, turning to face him firmly. “But I need to do this for the studio. I’ll be back once it’s done.”
Alex exhaled slowly. “I still don’t feel comfortable with you being around Noah.”
Sadie let out a bitter laugh. “Alex, Noah and I are over. He’s just a business partner now. Besides…”
She paused, her tone tinged with irony. “His heart is with Kyla. He doesn’t care about me.”
Alex clenched the steering wheel tighter, a twinge of pain crossing his face.
“Sadie!” He tried again, but the words stuck.
м?г? υρт ?т g?l?l?.
Sadie turned to the window. “Thank you, Alex. I really value this.” Silence fell heavily in the car, punctuated only by the engine’s soft rumble.
As they reached Laura’s apartment complex, the car stopped smoothly. As soon as Sadie emerged, a small figure raced toward her, wrapping himself in her embrace. “Mommy!” It was Averi. His face buried against her, he murmured, “Mommy, you’re home.” Sadie’s heart warmed instantly. She knelt, lifted Averi into her arms, and kissed his cheek. “Have you been good, Averi?”
“I have!” he replied, beaming, his arms tight around Sadie’s neck, his eyes shining with delight.
Noticing Alex exit the car, Averi offered a polite greeting. “Good evening, Alex.”
Alex smiled at the tender scene and gently tousled Averi’s hair. “Averi, you’re such a good boy.”
“Sadie, have you been looking for a rental place?” Alex inquired, concern evident in his tone.
The question reminded Sadie of her neglected task. “I’ll start tomorrow.”noveldrama
“Why don’t I help you? You seem tired,” Alex said, his concern palpable.
“That’s very kind, but I can handle it, Alex. You’ve done enough,” Sadie replied with sincerity, her voice edged with guilt.
She was grateful for Alex’s generosity, yet she was determined not to depend on him continuously. She needed to be self-sufficient to safeguard both herself and her son.
“That’s what friends are for,” Alex said, smiling weakly.
He watched Sadie cuddling Averi, their tender interaction evoking a whirl of emotions in him. How he wished he could openly be at her side. But…
He glanced at Sadie, yet found himself speechless, the words he needed to say trapped in his throat.
“Go upstairs and rest,” he murmured gently.
Sadie nodded, and with Averi snug in her arms, she headed upstairs. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 176:
“Bye!” Averi shouted.
“Bye.”
Alex remained still, watching them until they vanished down the hallway, then he slowly walked away.
The next morning, Sadie inhaled deeply and entered the Wall Group building. The receptionist welcomed her and pointed her toward the HR department.
There, the HR manager, impeccably dressed, greeted her with a smile that didn’t quite warm her eyes.
“Miss Hudson, welcome. I’m Ayanne Mitchell, the HR manager.”
“Hello, Ms. Mitchell,” Sadie responded, nodding courteously. “Mr. Wall has mentioned you to me. Please, come with me to your office.”
As Sadie followed Ayanne, she noticed the office layout was unchanged from three years ago. They moved past busy workstations, the clatter of keyboards echoing around them.
Instead of leading her to a modern office, however, Ayanne took her down a quieter corridor to a plain, weathered iron door. As Ayanne unlocked it, they were greeted by a musty smell.
Inside was a cluttered storage room, dimly lit and dusty, almost stifling.
Sadie stopped short.
“This is my office?”
Ayanne dismissed her concern casually. “Yes, Miss Hudson. It’s all we have available right now.” Her smile was sharp, with a flicker of mockery.
Sadie’s heart sank. This wasn’t an office; it was a forgotten storeroom. But she quickly regained her composure, her eyes hardening. After years in the corporate world, she was all too familiar with these tactics.
“Ms. Mitchell, are you certain this decision came from Mr. Wall?”
Your source of stories: galnσvls.
Ayanne paused, caught off guard by Sadie’s composed demeanor. She adjusted her glasses, striving to sound authoritative. “Absolutely, Mr. Wall personally arranged this.”
“Really?” Sadie’s lips twisted into a skeptical smile. “It seems more like someone is using Mr. Wall’s name to complicate things for me.” She stepped forward, reducing the distance between them. “Are you prepared to accept responsibility for someone else’s misconduct?”
Ayanne’s composure wavered, and her eyes darted nervously. Sadie’s direct challenge visibly unnerved her.
“Miss Hudson, I’m not sure what you’re suggesting.” Ayanne faltered, her confidence fading.
“Not sure?” Sadie’s smile widened with a hint of derision. “Let’s be clear. I suspect Kyla has bribed you, hasn’t she? Wall Group isn’t Kyla’s private empire, and you’re jeopardizing your career over her schemes. Are you really willing to risk it all?”
“I haven’t…” Ayanne’s response weakened as she avoided Sadie’s steady gaze.
“Really?” Sadie persisted firmly. “Then perhaps you should verify this ‘office arrangement’ with Mr. Wall right now.”noveldrama
Ayanne blanched, stepping back involuntarily, at a loss for words. Sadie observed her, a knowing smirk playing on her lips.
Sadie’s tone lightened suddenly, and she chuckled softly, her voice tinged with a hint of relief. “Never mind.”
Ayanne paused, perplexed. “Miss Hudson…”
Sadie looked around the room. “This will do.”
Confusion deepened on Ayanne’s face. “Miss Hudson, you… you’re not upset anymore?”
Sadie faced Ayanne squarely, her expression calm and insistent. “Upset? Why would I be upset? I just wanted to give you a few warnings.” She smiled subtly, her eyes glinting with mischief. “This place is quiet, away from certain distractions. It’s exactly what I need.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 177:
Ayanne struggled to grasp the sudden shift in Sadie’s attitude, finding it startlingly quick.
“Have someone clean up this room and equip it properly,” Sadie said.
Ayanne opened her mouth as if to speak, then thought better of it.
“Understood,” she responded, nodding respectfully.noveldrama
Dismissing further interaction, Sadie walked over to the room’s only window, opened it, and inhaled deeply, savoring the fresh air.
While the team scurried to prepare the “office,” Sadie checked her watch, took another deep breath to steady herself, and then headed to the Wall Group’s design department.
She tapped lightly on the meeting room door and, hearing a voice inside, pushed it open and entered.
Kyla was there, elegantly seated, browsing through a stack of documents. Her champagne-colored suit complemented her delicate complexion, and her sleek hair fell gracefully around her shoulders, giving her a look of innocence.
When Kyla saw Sadie, her lips curved into a faint smile, and she set the papers down.
Caught off guard, Sadie momentarily paused.
“Miss Wade? I didn’t know you’d changed careers to design work,” she said with a forced casualness and a slight smile.
Kyla’s smile briefly wavered before she regained her composure. “Miss Hudson, surely you jest. Noah would never have me do such basic tasks.”
A sharp twinge shot through Sadie’s heart, like a needle prick.
She suppressed her unease and asked evenly, without revealing any emotion, “Then, Miss Wade, what brings you to the design department?”
? d?  g.?
Kyla’s eyes locked on Sadie. “This time, the theme is ‘Timeless Love,’ a wedding jewelry collection.”
“Timeless Love…” Sadie echoed softly, the words hanging in the air. Visions of Noah looking at Kyla with affection haunted her thoughts. Noah and Kyla’s wedding. The realization hit her forcefully, reverberating in her mind.
It dawned on her that Noah had made her stay here to craft the wedding jewelry for his union with Kyla.
How ironic indeed.
Sadie’s complexion momentarily lost color, but she quickly masked her feelings.
Kyla noticed the subtle shift in Sadie’s demeanor, a slight smirk of victory playing on her lips.
“What’s wrong? Are you considering withdrawing from the contract?” Kyla’s tone was gentle, but the underlying sharpness was unmistakable.
“You misunderstand,” Sadie responded, her voice steady. “I was contemplating what design would truly embody a concept as magnificent as ‘Timeless Love.'”
“Remember, a wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event and requires exceptional attention. As for the budget, don’t concern yourself with it. Just ensure it’s unparalleled.”
Sadie looked at her quietly, her expression thoughtful and enigmatic.
“Of course, this is part of my responsibilities. Miss Wade, you can rest assured,” Sadie said.
Kyla nodded with satisfaction and turned to exit the meeting room. As the door closed behind her, Sadie’s polite smile disappeared, replaced by a cool, composed expression.
She recognized Kyla’s parting words for what they were—a subtle maneuver to exert pressure and provoke a response.
But Sadie was determined not to give Kyla the reaction she sought.
Upon returning to her office, Sadie found it had been tidied. Although still not perfect, it was far more organized than before.

###Chapter 178:
Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office…
“Mr. Wall, the work reports for today have been completed,” Samuel reported, closing the folder as he stood respectfully before the desk.
Noah’s fingers tapped lightly on the desktop, the sound soft in the quiet room. “Anything else?”
Samuel blinked, momentarily confused. He had already reported everything from Wall Group’s recent stock market performance to the initiation of new projects.
Noah lifted his eyes, a hint of impatience flickering through them. “Sadie… has she settled in?”
It took a moment for Samuel to catch Noah’s drift. A bead of sweat formed on his forehead as he quickly answered, “Everything’s arranged, but… her office is currently in the logistics warehouse.”
Noah’s expression turned even colder.
“Understood. You may leave now.” He dismissed Samuel with a wave of his hand.
Relieved, Samuel turned to leave, but Noah’s voice halted him.
“Wait.”
Samuel’s heart skipped a beat. Had he overlooked something? He turned back cautiously, his voice respectful. “Mr. Wall, is there anything else?”
“The branch office in Amberhollow is negotiating a deal. They need someone with legal expertise,” Noah stated, his tone neutral.
He paused briefly before concluding, “Send Kyla there immediately.” Amberhollow—a remote and underdeveloped region known for its poor infrastructure and harsh conditions. Sending Kyla there was more akin to punishment than an assignment.
Samuel hesitated briefly but quickly grasped the implication. He nodded. “Yes, Mr. Wall. I’ll make the arrangements right away.” Without asking further questions, Samuel quickly left the office, sensing that Noah’s directive was far from coincidental.
Later, as Samuel relayed the message to Kyla and turned to leave, a sharp crash resonated through the room. A delicate coffee cup had shattered on the floor, its fragments scattering everywhere.
Ga lno vel s . com takes you into new worlds
Kyla’s face twisted with rage, her breathing quick and uneven.
“Amberhollow? How could Noah send me to that wasteland?!”
“Miss Wade, please try to calm down…” her assistant ventured cautiously.
“Calm down? How can I calm down?!” Kyla snapped back. “Amberhollow is a nightmare no one deserves!”
Her hands balled into fists as she took a deep breath, attempting to regain her composure. She recalled seeing Sadie’s calm, composed smile earlier that day in the design department.
It dawned on her—this must be Sadie’s influence. Noah was punishing her, perhaps at Sadie’s behest.
The more Kyla pondered, the more her anger and jealousy grew.
Resolved, she decided she would make Sadie pay for this.
“Miss Wade, are we going there or not?” the assistant inquired timidly, her eyes flicking around anxiously.
Kyla’s gaze snapped up, her anger barely masked by her makeup. “Samuel just personally delivered the message! Do you think Noah hasn’t already decided? Why even ask?!” she barked.
The assistant recoiled, quickly bowing her head.noveldrama
“Yes, Miss Wade. I didn’t mean to question it…”
“Get the deputy director of the design department here immediately,” Kyla commanded.
The assistant, not daring to delay, hurriedly left to fulfill the order. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 179:
Soon after, a young woman knocked and entered the room. It was Jordyn Vazquez, the deputy director of the design department. Jordyn’s makeup was impeccably done today, and her professional suit accentuated her confident demeanor.
Kyla’s eyes briefly assessed Jordyn.
“Hello, Ms. Vazquez.”
“Miss Wade, hello.” Jordyn approached, bowing slightly in respect.
She knew well that Kyla was highly influential within Noah’s circle—and potentially his future wife. Crossing Kyla could jeopardize her career at Wall Group.
“Noah has arranged for me to go on a business trip. Today, Sadie, who has just joined us, has been placed in the storeroom—that’s my good friend. Do you understand what I’m implying?”noveldrama
Jordyn felt a slight tension build, her forehead beading with sweat. The storeroom was known for its poor conditions—a dark, damp space hardly suitable for anyone, much less for an office.
It was clear that Kyla intended to make Sadie’s situation difficult.
Jordyn caught on quickly, her expression composed as she replied with a faint smile, “Absolutely, Miss Wade. I will ensure Sadie is ‘well taken care of.’”
Kyla nodded, pleased. “You’re sharp. Handle this well, and the director position could be yours.”
A spark of ambition flashed in Jordyn’s eyes as she assured, “You can count on me. I won’t disappoint you.”
Meanwhile, in the dimly lit storeroom, Sadie sat at a simple desk surrounded by clutter. The faint musty smell of the room and the inadequate lighting made the space nearly unbearable.
Design drafts were spread before her, and she held a pen, though she found it hard to begin working.
Rubbing her temples, Sadie sighed deeply, overwhelmed by the oppressive environment.
?com where stories grow
Her frustration palpable, she dropped the pen onto the desk, where it landed with a crisp clack. Next to her, a wastebasket overflowed with crumpled drafts.
Just then, a knock came at the door.
“Please come in.”
The door creaked as it opened, and Jordyn entered.
Sadie looked up, her expression unreadable, as she regarded her visitor. Three years ago, when she worked as Noah’s secretary, Sadie had met Jordyn.
Back then, Jordyn was just an ordinary employee. Now, in just three years, she had risen to the position of deputy director.
Jordyn’s eyes swept over the shabby office, and a mocking smirk briefly appeared on her lips before she replaced it with a concerned expression.
“Sadie, are you settling in okay?”
“Thanks to Miss Wade, it’s not too bad,” Sadie replied dryly.
Jordyn feigned shock. “How can it not be? This is one of the finest offices in Wall Group!”
Sadie didn’t reply, simply offering Jordyn a knowing half-smile.
Feeling somewhat uncomfortable under Sadie’s steady gaze, Jordyn cleared her throat and changed the subject. “Would you like to join the department dinner tonight?”
“No, thank you,” Sadie answered without hesitation.
“Oh, come on! We were all colleagues once, and now we keep running into each other. It’s only polite to meet everyone and say hello!” Jordyn’s tone was light, yet there was an underlying insistence in her words.
Sadie realized that declining might give Jordyn a reason to complicate her situation further. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 180:
It seemed wiser to accept the invitation and gauge Jordyn’s intentions. After a moment’s pause, Sadie nodded. “Alright, I’ll attend.”
At that, Jordyn’s expression transformed into one of triumph. “Great! It’s settled then. Six o’clock tonight. Don’t be late!” With a confident stride, she exited the room.
Sadie watched Jordyn’s departing figure, her gaze thoughtful and deep. A cold smile played at the corners of her lips, hinting at her strategic mind at work.
Later that afternoon, the storeroom door creaked open, revealing a bright and cheerful presence.
“Sadie, are you busy?” Tina stepped inside, her chestnut curls bouncing around her delicate, doll-like face.
She carried two milkshakes in her hands.
Sadie looked up and met Tina’s gaze, which was filled with concern. Managing a small smile, she asked, “Tina, what brings you here?”
Tina approached, placing one of the milkshakes on Sadie’s cluttered desk and sitting across from her. She lowered her voice as she said, “I’ve got some juicy gossip for you!”
“What gossip?” Sadie asked, stirring the milkshake absentmindedly, though a sense of unease began to stir within her.
“Kyla is on a business trip!”
“A business trip?” Sadie’s brow furrowed slightly. “Isn’t that normal?”noveldrama
“Normal? Not at all! Guess where she’s headed? Amberhollow!” Tina’s voice was dramatic. “That remote, desolate place! Can you believe Mr. Wall actually sent her there? It’s so odd!”
Amberhollow?
A sudden chill ran through Sadie.
Keep reading on gα?ησv?s?com
That place…
Sadie maintained a composed expression, feigning nonchalance as she inquired, “What’s wrong with Amberhollow? It’s just another project.”
Tina gave her a knowing look, leaning in and whispering mysteriously, “That Amberhollow project is notorious for being a tough assignment! Many companies have struggled there. And now Mr. Wall sent Kyla to handle it? Doesn’t that seem odd?”
Sadie felt a flutter of anxiety, her grip tightening on the milkshake unwittingly. She lowered her eyes to conceal the unease flickering within them. Tina took a sip of her milkshake, let out a satisfied sigh, and then, as if struck by a sudden thought, looked up at Sadie.
“By the way, Sadie, are you free tonight after work? How about we go shopping?”
Sadie pondered for a moment and then shook her head, her voice tinged with regret. “I can’t tonight. The design department is having a gathering event.”
“Oh?” Tina’s face fell slightly. “Well, alright. Maybe another time.” She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a murmur. “Just be careful around that Jordyn. She’s trouble.”
Sadie offered a wry smile at Tina’s dramatic tone. “I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for the warning.”
After a bit more small talk, Tina left.
“Sadie, let’s go. We’re heading out for karaoke!” At around 5:30 p.m., Jordyn burst into Sadie’s office.
Before Sadie could react, Jordyn was pulling her away. A design draft still in hand, Sadie nearly collided with the desk edge. “Wait, I haven’t—”
“Oh, come on, what are you waiting for? Everyone’s already waiting!” Jordyn exclaimed, dragging Sadie out.
Jordyn, dressed in a form-fitting dress that highlighted her figure, led Sadie with a seemingly friendly grip that was surprisingly forceful. Sadie attempted to pull away several times but found it difficult to escape Jordyn’s strong hold.

###Chapter 181:
Sadie had assumed that a gathering for the design department would be held at a restaurant.noveldrama
However, Jordyn led her to a karaoke bar in a bustling district instead. The neon lights of the karaoke bar flashed rhythmically, and loud music blared from inside, contrasting sharply with the type of dinner gathering Sadie had envisioned.
Upon entering the private room, Sadie was dismayed to find it filled exclusively with male colleagues—many of whom were visibly overweight, some sporting potbellies—engaged in raucous drinking games. The atmosphere was more rowdy than professional.
A sense of unease washed over Sadie. She discreetly pulled out her phone and sent a quick text to Alex, hoping for some support or advice.
Meanwhile, back at Wall Group’s CEO office, Noah was wrapping up his day. He had just finished sending an email when he glanced at the wall clock and noted it was six in the evening. He stood, ready to leave, but as he passed by Sadie’s office and noticed its emptiness with the lights still on and an unfinished design draft on the computer screen, his brow furrowed in concern.
He summoned Samuel. “Where is the design department? They’re leaving this early?”
Samuel appeared equally perplexed. “I’m not sure either, sir.”
Just then, Tina happened to walk by with a stack of documents. Catching sight of Noah, she quickly chimed in, “Mr. Wall, the design department is at a gathering event tonight.”
“A gathering event?” Noah’s voice carried a hint of suspicion. “I wasn’t informed about this.”
Tina hesitated before responding, “It seems… it’s organized by Jordyn.”
A subtle shift flickered across Noah’s expression. He turned and left the office without another word. Tina watched his departing figure and let out a quiet sigh.

Meanwhile, back in the chaotic atmosphere of the karaoke bar’s private room, Sadie found herself encircled by several male colleagues, each one pressing her to drink. Despite her polite refusals, their persistence intensified.
Jordyn observed from a distance, a smirk curling her lips as she relished Sadie’s evident discomfort, her eyes shimmering with spite.
“Come on, Sadie, just one more drink!” urged a colleague, raising his glass. The strong scent of alcohol mingled with his cheap cologne, overwhelming her senses.
“I really can’t drink anymore,” Sadie implored, angling her body away to avoid his proximity.
Another colleague chimed in, snatching the glass from Sadie’s grasp and filling it with more liquor. “Oh, come on, it’s just one drink. What’s the big deal?”
Sadie’s expression tightened as she noticed an unusual, overly sweet odor emanating from the drink.
She discreetly placed the glass down, scanning the room.
Maintaining her composure, she declined once more. “I’m really sorry, I have something important to take care of later.”
“Something important?” Another colleague scoffed, reaching out to touch her face. “Sounds like an excuse to me.”
Sadie dodged swiftly, avoiding his hand and the uncomfortable situation escalating around her.
Sadie took a deep breath, struggling to suppress the anger surging within her. A sudden wave of heat flushed through her body, and her mind became foggy. She quickly realized something was off about the drink she had taken.
“Oh, come on, everyone. Let’s not get so worked up,” Jordyn intervened with a saccharine tone, feigning peacemaking. “We’re all colleagues here. Why make things difficult for Sadie? How about we play a game instead? Loser takes a drink. What do you say?”

###Chapter 182:
Sadie recognized Jordyn’s so-called offer for what it was—a veiled attempt to control the situation with ulterior motives lurking beneath. All she wanted now was to escape the increasingly oppressive atmosphere of the room. Each moment she stayed, the ordeal grew more unbearable.
Attempting to stand, Sadie felt her body sway unstably. She gripped the table for support, her strength waning and her head spinning wildly. The drug in her system was taking effect.
Panic set in, and she knew she needed to leave immediately.noveldrama
“I’m not feeling well. I need to go,” she said, her voice weak and shaky, as she turned towards the door.
“Hey, Sadie, don’t rush off!” One man blocked her path, his gaze unsettling. “The game hasn’t even started yet!”
Unable to tolerate any more, Sadie grabbed a wine bottle from the table and, in a desperate act, smashed it on the man’s head. The sound of shattering glass echoed loudly as the man screamed, blood pouring from a wound on his forehead.
Chaos erupted in the room.
After injuring several men, Sadie managed to stumble out of the room. Jordyn, utterly shocked by Sadie’s drastic response, sat frozen, staring at the bloody scene on the floor, her face pale with disbelief. She hadn’t expected the normally reserved Sadie to react so violently.
Stumbling out of the karaoke bar, Sadie felt her stomach churn, and her vision blurred.
In her hurried escape, her high heels twisted, causing her to fall hard onto the pavement, pain shooting through her knee. Struggling to rise but overwhelmed by weakness, she could only curl up on the ground, fighting nausea. With determination, Sadie bit down on her lip, forcing herself to stay conscious.
Then, a warm embrace lifted her up. The familiar woody scent enveloped her, soothing her frayed nerves.
“Sadie, what happened to you?” Alex’s voice was thick with concern.
gα?ησν?s﹒cm has it all
As Sadie looked up into Alex’s worried face, the tears she had been fighting back finally broke free. “Alex… they…” She struggled to speak through her sobs.
Alex’s heart clenched at the sight of her distress. He removed his jacket and gently wrapped it around her shoulders, pulling her close into a protective embrace. “Don’t be afraid. I’m here,” he said softly.
Carefully, he lifted her into his arms and hurried away from the disarray. Sadie rested her head against his shoulder, feeling dizzy yet immensely comforted by his presence.
Back inside the karaoke bar’s private room, chaos continued. Shattered bottles, spilled drinks, and the pungent mix of alcohol and blood permeated the air. Several men held their heads, groaning, their faces drained of color.
“What’s going on here?” Suddenly, Noah’s authoritative voice cut through the turmoil as he appeared at the doorway. He was dressed impeccably in a black suit, his imposing stature commanding immediate attention.
The men looked at one another, uncertainty flickering in their eyes.
Jordyn, attempting to regain composure, stepped forward with a forced calm. Wearing a face of contrived grievance, she began, “Mr. Wall, this was supposed to be just a department gathering. We never anticipated—”
“A gathering?” Noah’s incisive gaze swept over the chaotic scene. “A gathering could turn into this?” he questioned, gesturing towards the bloodstains splattered across the floor.
Jordyn’s heart raced, but she managed to maintain her composure. “It… it was an accident. Sadie accidentally fell, and then…”
“And then someone took her away?” Noah cut in sharply, his voice icy.
Jordyn hesitated, then quickly nodded. “Yes, a man took her away.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 183:
Noah’s expression grew darker, his eyes narrowing.
He issued a stern directive. “From now on, I don’t want to see any of these individuals in the company.”
“Mr. Wall…” The men attempted to interject, but the stern look in Noah’s eyes quelled any further pleas.
“The finance department will handle your settlements,” he stated dismissively before turning and striding away.
Jordyn watched his retreating figure, releasing a relieved sigh. But then a thought struck her. Sadie was once Noah’s secretary. His evident concern seemed unusual. Why would he care so much? Suddenly, Jordyn remembered a rumor she had once heard—that Sadie had been involved with Noah. Could there be any truth to that?
Meanwhile, Noah got into his car and pulled out his phone to dial Sadie’s number.noveldrama
“Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unavailable…”
Frustrated, Noah tossed the phone onto the passenger seat and slammed his hand against the steering wheel.
That damn woman!
The image of Sadie’s pale, distressed face lingered in his mind.
Inside the car, the air conditioning blasted cold air, yet it failed to cool the heat radiating from Sadie’s feverish body. She shifted uncomfortably, her mind wavering between confusion and moments of clarity. The world outside blurred past her.
Only the image of that chiseled face—sometimes sharp, sometimes fading into obscurity—dominated her fevered thoughts.
“Noah… it’s so hot…” Sadie murmured, fumbling with her shirt, struggling unsuccessfully to loosen it.
Her fingertips accidentally brushed against warm skin, a sensation both unfamiliar and comforting.

Alex gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles whitening with the effort. He forced his gaze to remain fixed on the road ahead, though the rapidly passing scenery seemed to stand still. The heat of Sadie’s breath filled the confined space of the car, intensifying the tension that already strained his nerves.
A tumult of emotions swirled within Alex. He felt deep pity for Sadie’s plight, yet he couldn’t deny the burgeoning feelings he harbored for her.
“Noah… water…” Sadie’s voice was soft, weak, almost affectionate. Alex’s heart skipped a beat, as he realized that in her delirium, Sadie mistook him for Noah.
Taking a deep breath to compose himself, Alex spoke with deliberate calmness. “Sadie, hold on. I’m taking you to the hospital right now.”
But Sadie seemed not to hear him. She attempted to move closer, continuously murmuring Noah’s name.
Her flushed cheek rested against Alex’s arm, her skin scorching where it touched him.
Alex’s breathing hastened, as he felt a heat rising within him, threatening to overwhelm his senses.
He clenched his jaw, determined to maintain his composure. He knew he couldn’t exploit Sadie’s vulnerable state. He couldn’t betray the trust she placed in him, even in her delirium.
He sped up, driving directly to the nearest hospital.
The hospital’s emergency room was brightly lit, bustling with activity. Alex carried Sadie in his arms, hurrying her into the examination room. The medical team quickly sprang into action, assessing her condition.
“She’s been drugged,” one of the doctors announced gravely.
Alex’s expression turned grim immediately. His fists clenched tightly, knuckles whitening with rage. He silently vowed retribution for whoever was responsible for harming Sadie. 
.

###Chapter 184:
Sadie lay on the hospital bed, her face contorted with discomfort, brows knitted together in distress. Alex remained by her side, his watchful eyes softening with concern. He gently stroked her hair and whispered reassuringly, “Sadie, don’t worry. I’m here with you.”
The sterile scent of disinfectant permeated the room. Gradually, Sadie’s eyelashes fluttered as she began to emerge from the drug-induced fog. She felt a comforting warmth as a hand enveloped hers, instilling a profound sense of security amidst her confusion.
Watching Sadie slowly regain her natural color, Alex finally allowed his tense muscles to relax slightly.
Suddenly, the door to the room burst open with a loud bang. A tall frame filled the doorway, his presence charged with cold fury.
Noah had arrived. His eyes, red and intense, scanned the room until they landed on Sadie. He moved purposefully towards the bed.
“Don’t touch her!” Alex exclaimed, standing quickly to shield Sadie from Noah.
Noah’s eyes narrowed menacingly at the sight of Alex’s hand gripping Sadie’s. His face darkened with anger, setting the stage for a confrontation.
He yanked at Alex’s hand. “Who do you think you are, blocking me?”
Unfazed, Alex held Noah’s challenging gaze. “I’m her friend—the one who stayed by her side when she needed help the most.”
Noah sneered. “Friend? Ha, I think you have ulterior motives!” He tried to reach for Sadie, but Alex stood firm, blocking him once more.
“That’s enough, Noah!” Alex’s voice carried a warning tone. “What Sadie needs right now is rest, not your complications.”
Noah’s patience snapped, his anger flaring as his voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. “Sadie is still my wife.”
The escalating argument startled Sadie awake. She slowly opened her eyes, the sight of the two men at odds over her leaving her bewildered. As Noah noticed Sadie’s awakening, his eyes narrowed further. Her gaze flicked between Noah and Alex, the air thick with their mutual hostility.
Step into fiction with . com
She tried to piece together her fragmented memories—karaoke bar, forced drinking, her escape…
She remembered.
Why would Noah appear here so suddenly? Could it be that… he orchestrated all of this?
A chill ran through her.
Propping herself up, Sadie forced a weak smile. “Did you enjoy the show, Mr. Wall?”
Noah’s expression darkened, his lips pressed tightly together in silence. Sadie continued, her voice gaining strength. “If you’re done here, then please leave. As for the design drafts for ‘Timeless Love,’ I will complete them as soon as possible and conclude our cooperation.”
Noah’s gaze sharpened, the intensity directed solely at Sadie, rendering the air in the hospital room thick and stifling.
He swallowed hard, the tension palpable. But ultimately, he remained silent, turned, and left the room abruptly.
Alex watched Noah’s retreating figure, then shifted his gaze to Sadie, whose face was pale and drawn, a complex mix of emotions flickering across his features.
Sadie closed her eyes and inhaled deeply, attempting to steady the tumult within her. It was over between her and Noah. She harbored no desire to entangle herself further with him. It was time to move forward for her sake and that of her child.noveldrama
Noah strode quickly from the room, the harsh fluorescent lights of the hospital corridor casting stark shadows across his determined face. He pulled out his phone and dialed Samuel’s number. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 185:
“Alex has been too idle lately,” he said, his voice low, carrying a subtle chill.
Samuel, understanding the implication, responded promptly, “Understood.”
“Good,” Noah said, his tone firm. “Don’t leave any traces.”
He ended the call, a glint of ruthlessness flashing in his eyes. Despite his actions, Noah wrestled with conflicting emotions. He didn’t want Sadie to find happiness, nor did he want her close to any danger. This paradoxical sentiment left him feeling restless and even agitated.
The next day, the design department was notably quiet, with only the sporadic sounds of keyboards clattering breaking the silence. Dressed in a sharp black suit, Sadie sat outside Jordyn’s office, a steaming cup of coffee in hand, her demeanor composed.
Jordyn arrived late, her high heels clicking on the floor as she rushed in, projecting confidence.
Her makeup was impeccable, and there was a trace of smugness in her eyes, as if the previous day’s events had been entirely forgotten.
“Sadie? What are you doing here?” Jordyn feigned surprise, her voice tinged with impatience.noveldrama
Sadie rose slowly, a cold smile playing on her lips. “I’m here to have a proper talk with you.”
Jordyn’s heart skipped a beat. She glanced at the coffee in Sadie’s hand and felt an inexplicable surge of unease. Though she had managed to cover up the chaos from the karaoke bar, a nagging feeling remained.
Forcing herself to appear calm, Jordyn pushed open the door to her office. “If you have something to say, let’s talk inside.”
Sadie followed her in and quietly shut the door behind them, the sound echoing sharply in the room.
Just as Jordyn was about to speak, Sadie preempted her, splashing the coffee from her cup onto Jordyn’s meticulously chosen light-colored suit.
Feel inspired on g?lnσν?s．cо
“Ah!” Jordyn screamed, jumping up both in shock and anger. The hot coffee drenched her expensive silk blouse, staining it instantly. Sadie watched, her expression unreadable, as Jordyn reacted.
“I’ll be at Wall Group for at most half a month. During this time, you’d better stay out of my way,” Sadie stated. Her voice was not loud, but it carried an undeniable edge of warning.
Jordyn, stunned and momentarily cowed, stood frozen, at a loss for words.
Sadie continued firmly, “You should know by now what kind of person I am. I’d rather break than bend. Cross me again, and I assure you, you’ll regret it.”
The memory of Sadie’s reputation for being a formidable designer and her decisive actions in the past sent a shiver down Jordyn’s spine. Sadie was indeed capable of following through on her threats.
Sadie’s eyes held Jordyn’s frightened gaze a moment longer, her lips curling into a scornful smile. “And tell the person behind you not to worry. After I leave Wall Group, I’ll have no further dealings with any of you.”
With that, Sadie turned and walked out, leaving Jordyn still trembling and disheveled.
Jordyn watched Sadie’s retreating figure, her makeup unable to mask the fear in her eyes. Sadie exited the office. The design department was silent, colleagues averting their gazes, too intimidated to speak.
She headed straight for her own office, her demeanor composed yet stern.
At that moment, Tina stepped out of the break room with two cups of coffee. Noticing Sadie, she looked startled.
“Sadie, are you… alright?” Tina asked, concern evident in her voice.
Sadie paused, turning to face Tina. A bitter smile briefly crossed her lips. “What could possibly be wrong?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 186:
Tina extended one of the coffee cups to Sadie. “What happened last night? I ran into Mr. Wall. He… he asked me where you were.” Her voice faltered, her eyes darting nervously as if she was fearful of overstepping.
Sadie’s expression turned contemplative. Noah had asked about her whereabouts?
Sadie had thought that Noah and Kyla had deliberately arranged for those people to humiliate her.
A chill ran down her spine, freezing her to the core, and her heart sank. Tina noticed the sudden change in her expression and grew even more uneasy.
“Sadie, are you… are you okay?”
Sadie took a deep breath, trying to steady herself.
“I’m fine,” she replied flatly, accepting the coffee Tina offered. The steam from the coffee warmed her face, but it couldn’t melt the icy weight in her chest.
She pushed open the door to her storeroom office, where a faint musty smell mingled with the scent of fabric. Setting the coffee down without taking a sip, she walked to the desk, pulled out her chair, and sat. Her slender fingers brushed the cold surface of the desk.
Her gaze landed on a design draft at the corner of the desk—a sketch she had created for Wall Group.
Picking up the draft paper, she studied it carefully.
“Timeless Love.”
What was she thinking? Even if Noah wasn’t involved last night, so what? He was married, yet promised another woman “timeless love”? How absurd!
A few days later, the design drafts were complete.
During this time, Jordyn had been unusually quiet, refraining from picking on her. It seemed the warning from last time had indeed worked.
The best stories are at g?lnσν?s?
Sadie organized the printed drafts and placed them on Jordyn’s desk. Jordyn flipped through them absentmindedly.
“Not bad,” she remarked.
Then, she pulled a gold-embossed invitation from her drawer and slid it across the desk toward Sadie.
“Here’s the invitation for Vision Clash; you’ll be a judge, representing Wall Group.”
Sadie picked up the invitation, her fingers tracing the intricate patterns on its surface. Vision Clash was one of the top art and design selection programs in the country, with judges being the best masters in the industry. Her gaze calm and steady, Sadie said, “But this is outside the scope of my work. My cooperation with Wall Group is strictly design-related, nothing else.”noveldrama
Jordyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. “This is Mr. Wall’s decision.”
Sadie sneered inwardly. Perhaps it was Kyla’s idea too. Lowering her gaze, Sadie said, “Since it’s Mr. Wall’s decision, I guess I have no choice but to comply.”
Jordyn’s eyes glittered with a flicker of triumph as she observed Sadie’s composed demeanor. She relished the thought of Sadie’s forthcoming embarrassment at Vision Clash. Imagine, a woman barely out of her early twenties judging her peers — she wouldn’t be taken seriously! Jordyn smirked.
Her red-nailed fingers drummed a rhythmic, sharp pattern on the desk. Leaning forward, she said, “Miss Hudson, I trust you won’t disappoint us.”
Offering a faint smile, Sadie responded with measured calm, “I’ll do my best.”
She left the room, her movements measured and poised. Behind her, Jordyn’s smile widened as she watched Sadie depart, the corners of her lips curling with satisfaction. Yet, as the distance grew, her smile waned, revealing a trace of concern. Turning to her phone, Jordyn dialed Kyla’s number.
“Hello, Miss Wade, it’s done,” she said, her tone dripping with feigned sweetness.
Kyla’s response was icy. “Did she agree?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 187:noveldrama
“She had little choice against Mr. Wall’s directive.” Jordyn chuckled.
Kyla’s laughter echoed softly, tinged with a clear note of satisfaction. “Excellent. This time, ensure there’s no escape for her. I want her downfall to be so severe that she can’t recover.”
“Don’t worry, Miss Wade,” Jordyn assured her swiftly. “I’ll oversee everything personally. She’ll be cornered.”
“Good,” Kyla responded, contentment in her voice. “And what of the Timeless Love design drafts? Has she turned them in yet?”
“They are already here, on my desk,” Jordyn confirmed promptly.
“Excellent,” drawled Kyla, her voice relaxed yet ominous. “Keep in mind, her reputation must be completely destroyed.”
Ending the call, Jordyn set down her phone, her lips curving into a malevolent smile. She picked up the drafts from her desk, her gaze sharp and scheming. She was curious to see how Sadie would attempt to deflect this latest challenge.
Meanwhile, Sadie was back in her office, her fingers brushing lightly over the intricate, gold-embossed details of the invitation. A subtle smile flickered across her face.
“Vision Clash? They’re truly desperate,” she mused quietly.
Could they really believe she was oblivious to their schemes? They intended for her to humiliate herself at the event and tarnish her reputation irreparably.
However, their schemes were on the brink of unraveling. Unbeknownst to them, she had secured her own invitation to Vision Clash.
After finishing her work, Sadie collected her belongings and exited the office. She made her way to the entrance of the Wall Group building, ready to hail a cab. Having recently returned to the country, she hadn’t yet purchased a car. Since she finished work early today, she decided to seize the chance to explore some potential homes.
The evening breeze carried a crisp hint of early autumn. Sadie tightened her coat and looked into the distance. At that moment, a man approached her. It was Samuel.
“Miss Hudson, Mr. Wall wants your presence.”
M?г? ?  l?l?.
Sadie glanced at the nearby parked Maybach. “That’s not necessary,” she responded with a cool detachment. “I have other matters to attend to.”
Samuel appeared troubled. “But Mr. Wall specifically instructed—”
“Mr. Ford,” Sadie cut him off. “My personal time is my own after work hours. It’s not subject to Mr. Wall’s approval.”
With that, she turned and walked to the curb, flagged down a cab, and left in a swirl of dust. Samuel stood watching the cab vanish, then sighed helplessly. He pulled out his phone and called Noah.
“Mr. Wall, Miss Hudson declined.”
In the back seat of the Maybach, Noah’s expression turned icy. “Find out where Sadie went.”
Samuel nodded. “Yes, Mr. Wall.”
After ending the call, he stared out at the traffic, his lips pressed tightly together in frustration.
Later, at a real estate agency, Sadie pointed to a photo of a property, her brow furrowed. “This one doesn’t have good lighting, and it’s too far from Averi’s school,” she noted.
The agent quickly offered another option. “How about this one? It’s well-ventilated, newly renovated, and located in a fantastic community. Plus, it’s very close to an elementary school and several kindergartens.”
Sadie’s eyes lingered on the photo of the two-bedroom apartment, noting its simple and elegant decor. It was indeed quite appealing. But she still shook her head. “It’s slightly over my budget.”
The agent tried to persuade her further, but Sadie had already stood up. “I’ll think about it.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 188:
She left the agency as the night deepened. House-hunting was indeed exhausting!
Noah sat in his expansive office chair, his long fingers tapping a rhythmic pattern on the desk. Samuel knocked and entered. “Mr. Wall, we’ve located her. Miss Hudson visited several real estate agencies today. It appears she’s looking for an apartment.”
Noah stopped tapping. “Which apartments did she consider?”
Samuel handed him the compiled information. “All the details are right here, Mr. Wall.” Noah skimmed the documents. All these apartments were far from Myrtlewood Estate.
“Arrange for someone to handle this,” he instructed.
Samuel, momentarily surprised, quickly nodded in understanding. “Understood!”
“Finally!” Sadie exhaled deeply, a smile of relief spreading across her face. After days of searching, she had secured a three-bedroom apartment. It was ideally located near the city center and a reputable public kindergarten, and best of all, it was within her budget.
“Miss Hudson, please review the contract. If everything’s satisfactory, you can sign here,” the agent said, offering her the document with a beaming smile.
Sadie examined each clause meticulously. Satisfied, she signed her name on the dotted line.
“You’re very decisive!” the agent remarked as he collected the signed contract. “Just so you know, I’m only the agent. The landlord is someone else, but you can contact me directly.”
“Thank you,” Sadie responded, making a mental note of the information.
With Averi’s school documents in hand, she grasped his small hand and walked to the nearby public kindergarten.
Averi, dressed in a neat blue shirt, blinked curiously at his surroundings. He clutched Sadie’s hand tightly, his little face tinged with nervousness.
The kindergarten instructors were intrigued by the lively young boy who had recently returned from abroad, eager to uncover more about his unique experiences.
Averi, with his effortless command of a foreign language and his bright, sociable nature, quickly endeared himself to them. The interview process unfolded without a hitch, and Averi was officially enrolled.
Sadie observed the warmth in Averi’s radiant grin and felt a profound wave of comfort and satisfaction.
Leaving the kindergarten behind, Sadie clasped Averi’s hand as they wandered along the shaded, tree-lined walkways of their community.
Once they stepped inside their home, Averi lifted his small face, gazing up at Sadie with wide eyes. In a soft, melodious voice, he asked, “Mommy, are we staying here now?”
“Yes, this will be our home from now on,” Sadie reassured him, her fingers gently brushing through his hair, her voice both soothing and certain.
Averi’s face lit up with delight, his tiny teeth peeking through as he grinned.
Golden rays of morning light streamed through the translucent curtains.
Sadie stretched languidly before pushing herself upright in bed.
Relocating was far from simple. She had taken the day off specifically to manage the moving process.
Her first order of business was to contact Carol.
“Carol, I’m moving today. Could you drop by and lend a hand with the packing?”
“Of course, Sadie! I’ll be there right away,” Carol responded with enthusiasm.
Sadie rose, made her way to the window, and drew back the curtains.
Sunlight spilled into the room, wrapping it in warmth. She exhaled slowly.noveldrama
A new residence—a blank slate brimming with opportunities.
Sadie headed to Laura’s room, tapping lightly on the door. “Grandma, are you up?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 189:
“Come in,” Laura answered, her voice slightly raspy.
Sadie stepped inside and found Laura sitting upright, a distant look in her eyes.
“We’re moving today!” Sadie informed her.
“Moving? To where?” Laura asked, her brow knitting together in confusion.noveldrama
“To the new place. It’s more spacious and comfortable,” Sadie explained gently.
“I’m not going,” Laura declared firmly. “I’ve been here forever—this place means too much to me. I won’t leave.”
Sadie knew Laura well—once she made a decision, changing her mind was nearly impossible. Having spent decades in the faculty housing, Laura had developed a deep attachment to her surroundings. Asking her to move was no small request. Though frustrated, Sadie also sympathized with Laura’s reluctance. For the elderly, familiarity often held more value than anything else. Taking a measured breath, Sadie softened her tone. “Alright, I understand.” Laura remained silent.
Sadie stepped out of the room and called Carol once more. “My grandmother won’t be coming with us for now. Stay here for a few days to look after her. Let me know if anything happens.”
“Understood, Sadie. Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of her,” Carol assured.
Ending the call, Sadie felt as if a burden had been lifted.
Meanwhile, in the design department of Wall Group, tension hung thick in the air, interrupted only by the rhythmic tapping of keyboards. Noah emerged from the elevator, his tailored charcoal suit fitting him flawlessly, his imposing presence bringing an abrupt hush to the room. He swept his gaze over the office, but the person he was searching for was nowhere to be seen.
His brows knitted slightly, and in a crisp tone, he asked, “Where is Sadie?”
Jordyn had been idly pretending to work, but in reality, her thoughts had long since drifted far away. Noah’s arrival sent a thrill through her. This was an unexpected stroke of luck! Kyla was nothing in comparison to Noah. If she could capture Noah’s heart, everything could change.
I€$? ￠?@t?€я$ Iη gиovε.c?m
She immediately abandoned her pretense of working, her heels clicking as she swayed gracefully toward him. Today, she had deliberately chosen a fitted blush-pink dress that gave her a delicate, alluring look. Lowering her gaze ever so slightly to highlight her elegant neckline, she spoke in a syrupy voice, feigning shyness. “Mr. Wall, Sadie requested the day off.”
Noah’s eyes flicked toward her briefly, his face unreadable. “She took a day off? For what reason?”
Jordyn’s pulse quickened, but she softened her expression. “She… mentioned she was relocating.” Noah’s frown deepened.
Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode out of the office, leaving Jordyn standing there, her smile stiffening. She watched his retreating figure, frustration simmering inside her. She had hoped to seize this opportunity to leave a lasting impression, yet he had walked away without a second glance.
Jordyn clenched her jaw, her lips pressing together in irritation. With an annoyed huff, she spun on her heel and stormed back to her desk, snatching up her phone.
Just then, the device buzzed in her grip.
“Hello?” She answered, her tone laced with annoyance.
“Jordyn, I’ve got fantastic news for you!” an excited voice chirped on the other end.
“What’s so fantastic? I’m not in the mood for this,” she snapped.
“Vision Clash will be attended by Sandra, the former lead designer of Majestic Ego! She will make a personal appearance as the event’s chief judge!”
Jordyn froze for a moment before a wicked grin stretched across her face. Sandra? The enigmatic genius who had taken the fashion world by storm? The only designer who had surpassed all designers in the industry in recent years? That name was legendary! No images of her had ever surfaced, adding to her elusive reputation. The public only knew her creations were masterpieces—but her true identity remained a secret. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 190:
Sadie was about to be utterly humiliated. To judge alongside an icon of Sandra’s caliber? She wasn’t remotely qualified!
“Got it,” Jordyn murmured before ending the call.
She grabbed her compact mirror from the desk, carefully adjusting her makeup. The bold lipstick accentuated her striking features, enhancing her allure. A self-assured smile played on her lips. She couldn’t wait to witness Sadie’s downfall.
The Vision Clash venue was a spectacle of radiance. Towering billboards flashed in rapid succession, while the red carpet buzzed with eager spectators. Excited cheers rang through the air, creating an electric energy. Jordyn donned a deep crimson gown that accentuated her porcelain complexion, making her look absolutely breathtaking.
She entered the event alongside the head of the design department. “You handled things well today, Jordyn. Be sure to make a strong impression on Sandra,” the director advised, giving her hand a reassuring pat.
“Of course.”
Jordyn’s gaze swept across the room, noting her colleagues trailing behind. They were dressed impeccably, their eyes alight with anticipation.
Everyone knew the true highlight of the evening—Sadie.
“Where is Sadie?” someone whispered. “Do you think she chickened out?”
Jordyn’s lips curled in derision. She was about to respond when her eyes landed on a discreet sign in the distance—Sandra’s Studio. Her pulse quickened. Without a word, she abandoned the conversation and strode purposefully in that direction.
Her heart pounded with exhilaration. If she could secure a mentorship under Sandra, her career would skyrocket. Her prestige would soar, and she would be untouchable.
Silently swearing to seize this opportunity, Jordyn moved toward Sandra’s preparation room. The door stood slightly ajar. Through the narrow gap, she glimpsed a slender silhouette moving behind a curtain. Holding her breath, Jordyn gently pushed the door open.
“Ms. Sandra!” she called, stepping inside. “I’m Jordyn Vazquez, a designer from Wall Group. Your work has been my greatest inspiration—I’ve admired you for years! It’s an honor to finally meet you!” She kept her voice steady, though excitement coursed through her veins.

With practiced poise, she clasped her hands in front of her, embodying grace and humility. She awaited a response, hoping this moment would mark the beginning of an extraordinary journey—one where she would rise under Sandra’s mentorship.
The figure behind the curtain stirred. Jordyn held her breath as they stepped forward.
But the moment her eyes took in the person before her, her expression shattered.
Standing before her was none other than Sadie. Draped in a sleek black suit, her long hair cascading effortlessly over her shoulders, Sadie met Jordyn’s gaze with quiet amusement. The soft glow of the lights outlined her silhouette, emphasizing her effortless elegance.
Jordyn’s thoughts came to a screeching halt.noveldrama
Impossible.
The revelation hit like a tidal wave, knocking the air from her lungs. Her entire body tensed. Then, rage took over.
With a sudden lunge, she swung her arm, aiming to strike. “How dare you pose as Sandra?!”
But Sadie had anticipated the move. She sidestepped smoothly, giving Jordyn a slight shove that sent her stumbling backward.
Jordyn barely regained her balance, her face burning with fury. She jabbed an accusatory finger at Sadie, her voice sharp with outrage. “You—You…”
Sadie simply regarded her with a bemused smirk. “Oh? Weren’t you just full of admiration moments ago? Ready to pledge yourself as my apprentice? Is this the attitude of someone seeking guidance?”

###Chapter 191:
Jordyn stood in stunned silence. Sadie’s composed demeanor only deepened the humiliation. She offered no further explanation—just a steady, knowing gaze. And that, more than anything, shattered Jordyn’s resolve and her composure cracked.
“You’re a fraud!” she screeched, her voice shrill with desperation. “A complete fraud! There’s no way you’re Sandra!” A storm of resentment churned within her. Everything she had schemed for had just collapsed into nothing.
Sadie exhaled lightly, stepping past her, but Jordyn wasn’t finished. In a flash, she grabbed Sadie’s wrist. “Where do you think you’re going?”
Sadie’s brows knitted together, irritation flickering in her gaze. With a firm tug, she freed her arm from Jordyn’s grasp, her tone cold.
“Let go.”
Jordyn recoiled, almost toppling over. Her voice was laced with spite as she confronted Sadie. “You’re not blind. Three years ago, you climbed the ladder by sleeping with Wall. And here you are, still entwined with him, even pulling strings to secure a deal with Wall Group. You claim to be Sandra? You think you’re fooling anyone? You’d be a joke if this got out!”
Sadie’s response was a scornful smirk. “Really, Jordyn, who do you think you are? You think you have any right to lecture me?”
Seething, Jordyn found herself speechless with fury. Without another word, Sadie turned to leave.
“You’re not going anywhere!” Jordyn stepped in front of her, blocking her path. “You can’t parade here pretending to be Sandra. You’re coming with me to the committee!”
Sadie’s laugh was cold and dismissive as she ceased to engage. She gestured to the security guards nearby.
“Escort her out.”
Two guards in black swiftly approached, each taking hold of Jordyn by an arm. Jordyn struggled and shouted, “Let me go! Do you know who I am? I’m a designer at Wall Group! Touch me, and you’ll regret it!”

The security team ignored Jordyn’s protests, forcibly removing her from the premises without hesitation.
Outside, the glow of neon lights and the noise of the bustling crowd filled the air. Jordyn found herself roughly dumped on the curb, her appearance disheveled, her dignity wounded.
As she glared back at the illuminated entrance of the venue, fury and resentment surged within her.
From the doorway, Sadie observed as Jordyn was forcibly removed, maintaining a composed expression. After a moment, she returned inside.
Calm settled over Sadie. She had foreseen Jordyn’s disruption and was well-prepared.
Meanwhile, the host took the stage.noveldrama
“Welcome to Vision Clash, ladies and gentlemen!” The host’s voice, filled with excitement, echoed across the room. “And now, please welcome the chief judge of tonight’s event—Sandra!”
As the spotlight shifted to the side entrance, the audience’s attention followed, filled with eager anticipation. Sadie emerged gracefully from backstage.
A hush fell over the crowd momentarily, then it erupted into thunderous applause.
Sadie’s design department colleagues were stunned, their expressions of disbelief plain for all to see. Sandra was actually Sadie? How could this be possible?!
Noah occupied a seat in the front row, his intense eyes slightly narrowed, his focus unyielding as he watched Sadie on stage. She shone brilliantly, her presence even more commanding than it had been three years prior. Back then, she had always appeared slightly reserved around him, her demeanor tinged with deference. 
.

###Chapter 192:
Yet now, she commanded the stage with undeniable confidence and grace. This was an image of Sadie he had never witnessed before.
Their eyes connected, Sadie’s gaze steady and unflinching. It had been three years, and now she was finally standing on an equal footing with him—perhaps even higher. The days when she felt overshadowed by him were a distant memory.
A cool smile briefly touched her lips, carrying no real warmth.
Within herself, Sadie felt calm, even a hint of self-satisfaction evident. “Thank you, everyone. It’s an honor to be here today as the chief judge of Vision Clash…”
With elegance, she approached the judges’ table and sat down.
Noah watched Sadie shine on stage, his emotions a tangled mess. “Sandra? How could she possibly be Sandra?” A piercing voice shattered the silence in the hall.
Melina Barker, known in the design department for her close ties with Jordyn, couldn’t hide her shock. She exclaimed sharply, “We’ve never seen Sandra before. Who’s to say this is truly her? Could this be an impersonator exploiting the situation?”
No sooner had she spoken than murmurs rippled through the crowd. Skeptical eyes turned towards Sadie. Contestants whispered to each other, puzzled over the authenticity of this young woman claiming to be Sandra.
The committee members appeared unsettled. Having never encountered Sandra in person, they were at a loss on how to handle the rising skepticism.
Sadie’s demeanor did not waver. She rose gracefully and advanced to the center of the stage.
“I recognize that my presence here today might come as a surprise. Given that Sandra has remained out of the public eye, your skepticism regarding my identity is understandable,” she said.
Sadie’s eyes swept the room, finally resting on Melina. A soft smile played on her lips. “Since there seems to be some doubt about my identity as Sandra, I’ll let the quality of my work do the talking.”
Melina squirmed under Sadie’s steady gaze but managed to maintain her composure. “That sounds fine in theory, but what assurance do you have that your designs aren’t just imitations?”noveldrama

With a light laugh, Sadie responded, “Imitations? How about this: I design something on the spot. Let’s take ‘Neo Metropolis’ as the theme. Both the judges and the audience can be our witnesses.” She looked around, addressing the competitors. “Anyone feeling confident in their skills is more than welcome to participate.”
This challenge stirred excitement throughout the venue. From his seat, Noah watched Sadie intently, admiring her confidence on stage.
The next three hours flew by, filled with an evident blend of tension and energy. Seated at the judges’ table, Sadie was a picture of concentration, engrossed in her crafting.
As time expired, one by one, contestants presented their designs. Displayed on the large screen were a variety of futuristic, urban-themed jewelry designs.
When Sadie’s creation was revealed, it stood out with its innovative use of tourmaline, creating a piece that combined clarity with a futuristic aesthetic, making it almost seem to leap out at the viewer. The room initially fell into a hushed awe, soon replaced by a resounding round of applause.
Sadie’s colleagues from the design department at Wall Group exchanged looks of disbelief, their expressions revealing their astonishment. Melina’s complexion drained of color, her lips trembling, yet she found herself speechless.
Throughout it all, Sadie remained cool and collected, her thoughts clear and undisturbed. She had anticipated such a result. To her, the contest was merely a minor hurdle.
Breaking the prevailing silence, Noah rose to his feet.
“Melina’s design deserves recognition too. It’s quite creative.” His voice resonated deeply, tinged with a subtle hint of advocacy.
Sadie’s eyes lingered on Noah momentarily. He retained his polished, suave demeanor, yet his gaze seemed more enigmatic now. A faint stir of emotion rippled through Sadie. Naturally, he was speaking up for his employee—perfectly understandable.

###Chapter 193:
The host swiftly intervened to smooth any ruffled feathers, proceeded to announce the results, and expressed gratitude to the judges and contestants for their exceptional contributions.
Jordyn lingered awkwardly at the roadside outside the venue, hastily calling Kyla. “Kyla, you’ll never guess who I just saw! Sandra! The elusive designer Sandra, and guess what? She’s actually that bitch Sadie!”
There was a brief silence on the other end before Kyla responded cautiously, “Are you saying Sandra is Sadie?”
“Yes, exactly! I was there, I saw everything! She’s at the Vision Clash event, acting as the chief judge! We need to do something; we can’t let her have all the glory!” Anxiety surged through Jordyn.
Similarly, Kyla felt a tidal wave of disbelief hit her. Could it really be that Sandra was Sadie? This revelation was nothing short of explosive for her.
“Understood, I’ll take care of it.” She ended the call and sank into contemplation.
In Amberhollow, Kyla’s hands balled into fists. She couldn’t bear the thought that Sadie, the person she loathed and considered a nuisance, was in fact Sandra, a celebrated designer worldwide. This revelation was unacceptable! She felt compelled to act.
Taking a deep breath, Kyla attempted to regain her composure. She reached for her phone and made a call.
“Check the background of every contestant in ‘Vision Clash.’ I want a full rundown.”noveldrama
The voice on the other end responded with deference, “Certainly, Miss Wade. I will begin immediately.”
After hanging up, Kyla moved to the window, her eyes scanning the dim cityscape. The following morning, a man in black entered the room. “Miss Wade, here’s the information you requested,” he said, presenting Kyla with a file.
Kyla accepted the file and quickly reviewed the contents. Beccy Quimby, an aspiring designer hungry for recognition but short on talent, was the ideal tool for Kyla’s plans.

“Contact Beccy Quimby for me. Offer her a chance at fame, on the condition that she follows my directives,” Kyla commanded. The man nodded and exited promptly.
The preliminaries kicked off. Beneath the dazzling lights, stunning jewelry pieces were unveiled one after another.
Sadie, with a discerning eye, evaluated each entry, marking her scores. The “Galaxy” necklace particularly drew her attention. Its meticulous craftsmanship and stunning design showcased the designer’s talent. Sadie allowed herself a small smile, appreciating the piece before assigning it a high score.
Among the generally unremarkable entries, this piece shone brilliantly, undeniably captivating.
The preliminaries concluded, and the backstage was teeming with activity. Just as Sadie was about to depart, a hesitant voice reached her ears.
“Hello, Sandra! My name is Beccy Quimby.”
Turning, Sadie encountered a young woman with a ponytail, her expression a mix of nervousness and hope. This young woman had designed the necklace named “Galaxy.” Beccy held a small box carefully, her cheeks tinged with pink and eyes brimming with admiration.
“I’ve looked up to you for so long. Your designs have greatly inspired me. It means so much to receive your endorsement today,” she said. With a bit of bravery, she offered the box to Sadie. “I baked these pastries myself. I hope you like them.”
Taking the box, Sadie was greeted by the sweet aroma of fresh pastries. She met Beccy’s earnest gaze, touched by her gesture.
With a warm smile, Sadie responded, “Your design showed great creativity and charm. Continue to dedicate yourself, and you’ll find remarkable success.”
Tears of joy welled up in Beccy’s eyes. She took a deep breath and asked, “Could I possibly study under you?”

###Chapter 194:
Sadie paused, touched by Beccy’s earnestness but wary. “I’m sorry, I don’t take students.”
Beccy, a bit taken aback, quickly recovered. “I’ll keep striving!”
Suddenly, photographers swarmed, their cameras flashing, capturing the exchange. Once the media had moved on, Sadie declined the staff’s invitation to linger and exited the bustling venue by herself.
As she stepped outside, a cool evening breeze hinted at the coming autumn, prompting her to wrap her coat more snugly around herself. Having not seen Alex for several days, she contemplated calling him but then hesitated, wondering if he might be too busy, and ultimately decided not to.
Fatigue crept up on her as she massaged her temples. Pulling out her phone, she glanced at the time. It was already time to fetch Averi from school.
At the entrance of the kindergarten, the air buzzed with the lively chatter of children.
Upon seeing Sadie, Averi dashed towards her with glee, leaping into her embrace. “Mom!”
Sadie crouched down, picked Averi up, and kissed his cheek gently. “How was your day at kindergarten?”
Averi swelled with pride and responded, “Fantastic! My teacher told me my drawing has improved!” Sadie’s face lit up with a tender smile.
Together, they strolled back to their home, hand in hand. After they finished eating, Sadie spent some time playing games with Averi before reading him a bedtime story. Listening to Sadie’s calming voice, Averi slowly drifted off to sleep. She gently tucked him in and left a kiss on his forehead. After turning off the light, she quietly left the room.noveldrama
The night had deepened, and silence blanketed the world beyond the window. The sharp ring of the phone abruptly woke Sadie the following morning. Her phone on the nightstand showed “Tina” on the display.
She wiped her sleepy eyes and picked up.
Fresh updates now on g?lnσνes?com
“Sadie, are you aware of the latest headlines?”
“What headlines?”
“About you and Beccy! Photos of you receiving her gift have surfaced, sparking rumors online that you favored her unfairly!” Alertness replaced Sadie’s sleepiness in an instant.
A gift from Beccy? Accusations of favoritism?
She leapt out of bed, her feet hitting the cold floor, and strode to the window to yank back the curtains. The bright morning sun was piercing, yet it paled in comparison to the turmoil brewing within her.
A heavy feeling settled in Sadie’s chest as she realized the implications. “I’m on it now.”
Ending the call, Sadie quickly grabbed her phone to check the headlines. The hashtag #SadieHudson&BeccyQuimby dominated the trending topics.
She clicked on the link, and her screen filled with articles and the incriminating photo of her receiving the gift from Beccy. The photo was taken from a manipulative angle, implying a secretive exchange. The comment section was a turmoil of speculation and condemnation.
“I knew it looked too perfect! How else could Beccy’s design have stood out so much?”
“What did Sadie get for this? She’s too audacious!”
“I thought Sadie was above this, but she’s just like any other compromised designer!”
Sadie browsed the comments with a sinking heart and a hardening expression. She exited the news app and dialed her assistant.
“Pierre, we need to get to the bottom of this. Find the source of those photos. Someone’s orchestrating this chaos.”

###Chapter 195:
“Understood, Miss Hudson.”
Sadie’s stilettos clicked against the tiled floor of the Wall Group building. She looked sharp and sophisticated in her beige pantsuit as she walked across the lobby with her head held high.
She entered the elevator, and as it slowly made its way up, she felt her heart pick up its pace. An inexplicable sense of trepidation began to creep into her chest. This was definitely not going to be a calm day.
The elevator doors opened with a soft ding, and Sadie made her way to her office. As soon as she entered the door, she was greeted by a shrill, mocking laugh.
“Well, well, if it isn’t our big-shot designer, Sadie! How brave of you to show up for work today!” Jordyn was lounging in a chair, her legs crossed in front of her as she eyed Sadie up and down.
Sadie paused in her tracks and pinned her gaze on Jordyn. They stared at each other for a few seconds before Sadie turned away and went to her desk. She set her purse down and sat in her chair, ignoring Jordyn’s provocation.
“What’s the matter? Cat got your tongue? Or did all those nasty comments online finally get to you?” The lack of reaction to her taunts had emboldened Jordyn.
Sadie looked up, met Jordyn’s gaze, and finally spoke. “If your concern is genuine, Ms. Vazquez, then I appreciate it. But if this is just another way to mock me, I’d really rather be left alone to focus on my work.”
“Work? You’ve got some nerve to talk about work! Do you even realize what you’ve done? Taking bribes, using connections to get ahead… You’ve completely ruined this company’s reputation!”
Sadie gave her a tight but polite smile. “The investigation is still ongoing, but I see that you’ve already made your own judgments. Don’t you think that’s a little bit hasty of you? Or is it because you’re actually the one pulling the strings from behind the scenes? You seem so eager to see me confess to things I didn’t do.”
Jordyn’s expression shifted, her eyes flickering in what looked like panic, but she managed to compose herself in a matter of seconds. “What nonsense are you spewing now? I’m not pulling any strings. I am simply stating facts!”
“Is that so? Let’s wait for the results of the investigation, then, shall we?” Sadie’s tone was a little icy. She turned her attention back to the files on her desk.

“Sadie Hudson,” Jordyn spat out, her eyes burning with rage. “I advise you to give up while it’s still early. You will never beat me!”
“Well, the winner is yet to be determined,” Sadie replied flatly without even looking up.
Gritting her teeth, Jordyn jabbed a finger in her direction and said, “Fine! Just you wait. I’ll make you regret this!”
Then she shot to her feet and stormed out of the office, slamming the door behind her.noveldrama
At last, the office was quiet and peaceful. Sadie put down the documents she had been trying to read and massaged her forehead.
At that same moment, in the CEO’s office on the top floor, Samuel was standing before Noah’s desk, offering up a file. “This is all the information you requested, sir.”
Noah took the file and flipped it open, his eyes quickly skimming through the contents. The more he read, the deeper he frowned. “How’s it going with the accusations of bribery against Sadie? Has it been cleared up yet?”
Samuel hesitated for a moment. “There’s no concrete evidence to present at the moment, but I’m afraid public opinion is highly unfavorable toward Miss Hudson.”
Noah slapped the file against his desk. “I want you to find out the truth as soon as possible. I don’t want any more of these baseless rumors to make rounds.”
“Yes, sir,” Samuel replied with a slight bow, though a cloud of doubt hovered at the back of his mind. He wasn’t quite sure what to make of Noah’s attitude when it came to Sadie. On the surface, he didn’t seem all too concerned about her affairs, yet he would go to such lengths to get her out of trouble. As a result, Samuel himself was confused about which stance to take in tackling this matter. 
.

.
###Chapter 196:
Noah absently tapped his fingers against the desk before speaking again. “Keep a close eye on Kyla. Dig around and see if she is involved in any way.”noveldrama
Samuel’s heart skipped a beat at that, but he didn’t let it show on his face. “Understood, sir.”
Noah plopped back in his seat, grabbed a pen, and signed his name on the file.
Samuel took that as his cue to leave. He quietly exited the room, closing the door behind him with a soft click.
Later, Sadie was walking out of the elevator when she spotted a group of employees from the marketing department gathered nearby. They were having a hushed discussion, and although they spoke in whispers, their voices were loud enough for Sadie to catch bits of their conversation.
“She is Sandra—the former secretary.”
“I heard she used connections to get ahead, and now she’s back.”
“Who knows what kind of things she did to get to this point.”
Sadie’s expression remained blank as she walked past them, her gaze fixed straight ahead.
Sadie was unfazed by the rumors swirling around her. In any office, gossip was as common and unavoidable as the air we breathe. She chose to ignore such idle chatter, preferring instead to dedicate herself to her work and let her achievements speak for themselves.
“Miss Hudson, long time no see,” the voice was sharp and biting.
Sadie came to a halt and glanced toward the voice. It came from Melissa Frazier, the marketing department’s manager.
Sadie recalled that during her days as a secretary, Melissa had frequently gone out of her way to complicate her life. Today, Melissa was clad in a bright red dress and overdone makeup, which only accentuated her showiness. With her arms crossed and a self-satisfied look on her face, Melissa eyed Sadie.
“Do you need something, Ms. Frazier?” Sadie asked.
Explore more now on g?lnσνls?com
“Is it wrong to say hello without any particular reason?” Melissa retorted. “I just wanted to remind you that you’re in the marketing department now, not the secretarial department. It might do you some good to remember our rules.”
“Thank you for the heads-up, Ms. Frazier,” Sadie replied, maintaining a courteous yet distant smile. “I’ll take note.”
Without another word, Sadie continued on her way, leaving Melissa behind.
Melissa, fists clenched, watched as Sadie walked away. Just then, Tina, passing by and witnessing the exchange, hurried over to Sadie and took hold of her arm.
“Sadie, ignore them,” Tina whispered gently. “They’re envious, that’s all.”
With a mild smile, Sadie responded, “I’m aware. It really doesn’t bother me.”
“How can it not bother you?” Tina’s voice grew louder with incredulity. “Their behavior is absurd!”
Facing the marketing team directly, Tina spoke with a firm tone. “Why the whispers? Sadie is now a partner of Wall Group and leads her own studio! She’s not your subordinate. Have some decency!”
The marketing team members visibly recoiled, intimidated by Tina’s assertive stance, and fell silent.
Sadie softly touched Tina’s hand, reassuring her. “Tina, it’s okay.” Tina, observing the genuine peace on Sadie’s face, understood she was truly unbothered.
With a sigh, Tina linked arms with Sadie and steered her toward the break room. “Let’s have some coffee.”
They settled into the break room, sinking onto the sofa.
Cradling her own steaming coffee, Tina looked at Sadie with a mix of concern and admiration. “What’s your strategy? Are you just going to let them continue like this?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 197:
Sadie maintained her composure. “I’ll handle things as they unfold. The rumors will cease once people see they have no impact on me. Ultimately, the truth will prevail.”
Tina admired Sadie’s calm demeanor, though it also stirred a touch of sadness within her.
At that moment, Sadie’s phone buzzed.
She looked at the caller ID to see it was Pierre, her assistant.
“Hello,” Sadie answered.
“Miss Hudson, I located the paparazzo. He’s willing to meet this evening at Azure Mist Cafe.”
“Okay, understood. I’ll meet him at seven. You’ll come with me.”
“Will do, Miss Hudson.”
After ending the call, Sadie set her phone down on the desk.
Tina glanced at her, uncertainty clear in her expression.
“Sadie…” she said tentatively.noveldrama
Looking up, Sadie offered a slight smile. “I’m okay. Just some matters to address.”
As dusk settled, the city’s lights flickered to life.
The ambiance inside Azure Mist Cafe was cozy, illuminated by gentle, warm lighting.
Seated by the window, Sadie and Pierre awaited the arrival of the paparazzo.
Pierre looked around nervously, while Sadie perused the files she had brought with a calm demeanor.
Soon, a man clad in a black jacket and a baseball cap approached and took the seat opposite them.
He took off his cap, revealing a rather untrustworthy face. “Hi, I’m Jarrod Bates.”
The magic happens on g?lnσνs
Sadie looked up. “You’re the one who took those photos?”
Jarrod’s expression carried a hint of arrogance. “Yes, I took them.”
“Who put you up to it?” Sadie inquired, her gaze piercing as she fixed her eyes on him.
Caught off guard by her directness, Jarrod hesitated.
“I decided to take them on my own…”
Sadie scoffed. “Really? Mr. Bates, do you expect me to believe that?” She leaned in a bit closer.
Jarrod shifted uncomfortably, recoiling slightly from her intense scrutiny.
“The technique was sophisticated, the angles carefully chosen. You’re clearly professional; such precision isn’t typical of random paparazzi, who prefer clear, simple shots. You focused on blurring my face and capturing the exact moment Beccy handed me the gift, evidently aiming to sway public opinion against me.”
Sadie paused to let her words sink in. “So, who paid you? Five hundred thousand dollars? A million? More?”
Sweat formed on Jarrod’s brow as he squirmed, his eyes flickering with unease.
He had imagined a straightforward job: snap some photos, collect the cash, and vanish.
Yet, here he was, caught in what seemed like an inescapable snare.
Pierre remained quiet, attentively watching the interaction unfold.
He found himself impressed by Sadie’s composed manner.
Sadie allowed the moment to breathe, patiently awaiting Jarrod’s reply.
“You know how it goes in this business, right, Miss Hudson?” Jarrod attempted a calm demeanor, but his voice betrayed his nervousness.
He rubbed his hands, concealing his inner turmoil.
Nonchalantly, Sadie pulled out a bank card from her purse and slid it across the table toward him.

###Chapter 198:
“I’m quite familiar with the rules. Now, tell me—who directed you to do this?”
Jarrod gulped, his eyes greedily darting to the card, then forcefully reined in his desires.
“I’m not sure who she was. A woman approached me, handed me some money, and instructed me to keep an eye out at that place. All she wanted was photographs of you and Beccy together,” Jarrod explained.
“A woman?” Sadie furrowed her brows, deep in thought.
She was surprised. How could Jarrod have predicted she would receive a gift from Beccy at that precise moment? Was the gift from Beccy part of a setup too?
Questions flooded Sadie’s mind.
What she had dismissed as a mere misunderstanding now appeared to be a complex scheme.
Noticing Sadie’s silence, Jarrod misinterpreted it as intimidation and became more audacious.noveldrama
“Miss Hudson, I implore you to forgive me just this once. I was only trying to earn some money.”
Sadie’s response was firm and dismissive.
“Leave now.”
Jarrod snatched up the card and quickly exited.
“What’s our next move, Miss Hudson?” Pierre inquired with concern.
Sadie averted her eyes, her decision made.
“I need to see Beccy.”
Pierre nodded, silently agreeing, and followed Sadie out.
New stories uploaded on g?lnσνls?com
Once in her car, Sadie attempted to contact Beccy.
The phone emitted a series of beeps.
It rang persistently, yet there was no answer.
Sadie’s expression showed her frustration as her brows drew together, a feeling of disquiet settling over her.
She tried calling several more times, each attempt meeting with the same recorded message.
“Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unavailable.”
Unavailable?
A cold shiver ran through Sadie’s heart.
It appeared she was already too late.
Turning to her assistant, she commanded, “Pierre, track down Beccy immediately. We need to act quickly.”
“Right away, Miss Hudson,” Pierre responded, then hurried off.
Sadie put her phone back into her purse.
She had notified Averi’s kindergarten teacher earlier that she might be late today.
Upon arriving, Sadie found Averi alone, quietly playing with some building blocks, his expression a bit somber.
His outfit consisted of a light blue T-shirt and khaki shorts, which made him look particularly cute.
A slight heaviness weighed on Sadie’s heart.
Typically, Averi was vibrant and joyful, rarely subdued. She approached swiftly, knelt beside him, and softly inquired, “What’s the matter, Averi?”
Raising his tear-filled eyes to hers, Averi murmured, “Mom, the other kids… they said I don’t have a dad…” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 199:
The comment pierced Sadie’s heart with a sharp pain.
She enveloped Averi in a warm embrace, whispering reassurance.
“Ignore what they say, sweetheart.”
Averi nestled his head against her, his shoulders shaking gently. Embracing him closely, Sadie felt a surge of protectiveness mixed with a sense of helplessness.
She stroked his back tenderly, each pat meant to comfort and calm him. Averi’s tears slowly subsided, though he still let out a sniffle now and then.
“Why don’t we head home and cook something tasty?” Sadie suggested. Nodding, Averi pulled away from her hug, his eyes still brimming with tears.
Together, they left the kindergarten, Sadie holding Averi’s tiny hand.
Once at home, Sadie donned an apron and started on dinner. The kitchen came alive with the sounds of cooking, and delicious smells began to waft through the air.
Averi, seated on the living room sofa, toyed listlessly with a Transformer, his attention drifting.
Occasionally, he looked towards the kitchen, his expression tinged with sadness.
The hurtful words from his classmates earlier that day lingered in his mind, causing his heart to feel heavy.
Deep down, he felt a profound longing for his dad.
Averi quietly approached Sadie’s bag and searched it for her phone.
He was trying to reach Alex.
To Averi, Alex had always been kind, filling the role of the father he yearned for.
As he attempted to make the call, Averi’s small finger accidentally hit a number from the recent calls.
€$? tя? ?n ln?νεl?.c
The call connected.
Averi anxiously waited.
“Hello?” A low, steady voice with a cool edge came through the line.
It was Noah.
At the other end, Noah paused, mistaking the caller for Sadie, suspecting she wanted to come back to him.
His eyebrows knitted together slightly. “Sadie, what do you need?” After a brief pause, the sound of quiet crying filled the silence.
“It’s Averi…” came a small, muffled voice. “I really miss you.”
Noah was taken aback.
He realized then that it wasn’t Sadie, but a child on the line. He quickly stood up from his office chair.
“Time to wash up, Averi. Dinner is on the table.” Sadie’s voice floated softly from the kitchen.
“Alright!”
Averi’s cheerful reply came, but he stayed where he was instead of moving toward the living room.
Confused, Sadie shut off the stove and stepped out of the kitchen. There, she spotted Averi by the sofa, quietly speaking into the phone. A sinking feeling gripped her heart.
Approaching quickly, she glimpsed the name on the phone screen—Noah.
Why was he on the line?
Her expression shifted suddenly. She swiftly snatched the phone from Averi’s hand and disconnected the call.
Standing there, Averi looked up, his large eyes clouded with confusion. “Mom… what did I do wrong?” he asked in a small voice.

###Chapter 200:
Sadie hesitated, gathering herself to calm the turmoil inside and maintain a composed exterior.
She knelt down, touching Averi’s head tenderly. “You haven’t done anything wrong, Averi,” she assured him, though her voice betrayed a hint of tension.
Sadie deliberately avoided meeting Averi’s searching eyes, not wanting him to notice the distress on her face.noveldrama
What had Noah heard just now? What if he decided to come right over? The thought of him discovering Averi’s existence was too overwhelming for Sadie to entertain.
“Let’s go have dinner,” she suggested, gently guiding Averi by the hand to the dining table.
Steam rose from the dishes laid out. Sadie managed a forced smile while serving Averi, but her own meal tasted bland to her.
At Myrtlewood Estate, Noah was fixated on his phone screen where the call had just been cut off. His features hardened.
He was convinced he’d heard a child’s voice. He was just about to leave for Sadie’s place to seek the truth when the door quietly swung open. Isabel entered the room.
Her outfit was understated yet sophisticated, and she moved with poise, though her eyes revealed underlying concern.
“Noah, why are you still working at this hour?” Isabel approached him, concern evident in her tone.
Noah looked up briefly, his voice detached. “I need to step out for a bit.”
Isabel settled into the chair across from him with a heavy sigh. “Kyla called earlier today.”
A trace of annoyance crossed Noah’s face, his brow tightening slightly. Catching the shift in his expression, Isabel continued earnestly, “Noah, Kyla has been waiting for a long time. Maybe it’s time to consider marrying her. I’m getting older, and my only wish is to see my grandchildren.”
Lɑtτ cнαρτ?rs ιn glov?ls.
Noah’s face hardened, his lips thinning into a tight line. He said, his tone sharp, “You shouldn’t meddle in my life.”
He left without another word, his tall figure receding through the doorway, while Isabel remained in the study, her face etched with loneliness.
Later that evening, Averi snuggled into Sadie’s arms after dinner, his breaths deep and rhythmic. Sadie caressed his hair tenderly, her face softening with affection. She got up, gently placed Averi into his bed, and snugly tucked the blankets around him.
Right after she had finished tucking him in, a knock came at the door, simultaneously with her phone ringing. It was Pierre calling, as she saw on the caller ID.
Sadie moved to the door and looked through the peephole, her eyebrows knitting together. Outside stood Noah.
As she took the call and opened the door simultaneously, Noah was there in a neatly tailored black suit that enhanced his tall frame, the dim porch light casting dramatic shadows across his chiseled features, underlining his stark, almost severe handsomeness. Yet, his deep-set eyes carried an unspoken chill.
“What are you doing here so late?” Sadie asked.
Without responding, Noah stepped inside, his eyes briefly meeting hers.
Sadie, in her comfortable home clothes with her hair freely draped over her shoulders, looked unusually gentle and less formal.
At the same time, Pierre’s voice came hurried and anxious through the phone, saying, “Miss Hudson, the person who took Beccy away is Samuel Ford.”
Samuel Ford, a name well known as Noah’s right-hand man.
Sadie’s hand clenched the phone a little tighter.
It seemed Noah was involved. But what was his intention?
A shiver of apprehension ran through her. 
.

###Chapter 201:
She ended the call and confronted Noah. “Why did you take Beccy away?”
An unsettling thought flashed through her mind—had Noah uncovered the mastermind behind all this?
Could Noah have taken Beccy away to protect someone else? Who would Noah protect with such stamina?
Sadie’s gaze landed on Noah’s face. Kyla was the only one who had ever elicited such protectiveness from him. Who else could it be? A cold smile crept across Sadie’s face, her eyes reflecting the coldness.
“Mr. Wall,” she said, her tone laced with sarcasm, “what urgency brings you here tonight? Are you here to prevent me from uncovering truths that might embarrass your lover, or perhaps your fiancée?”
Noah’s forehead creased, and he opened his mouth to respond, but Sadie cut him off.
“I’m quite busy. Please show yourself out,” she said briskly, nodding towards the door.
A shadow crossed Noah’s face. He studied Sadie, curiosity tinged with surprise evident in his expression. She seemed altered somehow tonight. He hesitated, then glanced towards the bedroom.
“About that child earlier…” His voice was soft yet tinged with bewilderment.
Sadie’s heart raced, and she instinctively moved to block the bedroom door.
“This is not your concern.”noveldrama
“Are you hiding something from me?” Noah’s tone softened, yet it held a sharp undertone.
Sadie felt her heartbeat hasten, but she regained her composure swiftly. The call with Averi must have raised Noah’s suspicions.
Sadie met Noah’s eyes firmly. “Mr. Wall, our marriage has ended. You have no say in my personal affairs anymore.”
gα?ησνs?com brings you fresh updates
Noah’s expression darkened further.
“I didn’t consent to our divorce, Sadie.”
A rush of profound sadness overwhelmed Sadie. He had been the one pushing for it, and now he was contesting it? The absurdity of it struck her deeply.
Noah scrutinized her closely, seeking any sign of vulnerability. He was on the verge of saying something, his anger nearly boiling over, when an unexpected knock at the door halted him.
The noise cut through the tension hanging between them.
Both Sadie and Noah turned their attention toward the door.
“Who’s there?” Sadie called out.
“Sadie, it’s me, Alex,” answered a gentle voice.
Sadie moved to open the door. As she reached for the handle, a strong hand clamped around her wrist, squeezing painfully. She grimaced, looking down at Noah’s grip.
Despair gripped Sadie. What was his intention?
“Release me,” she said sharply.
Silently, Noah fixed his intense gaze on her while his hold remained firm.
A heavy stillness filled the hallway, as if time itself had paused.
From outside, Alex’s concerned voice reached them. “Sadie? Are you okay?”
Sadie felt a deeper drop in her heart. She didn’t want anyone to see her in such a messy, tangled situation with Noah.
“Noah, release my hand now!”
“Mom?” From the bedroom came a sleepy murmur.
A small figure stood in the doorway, blinking slowly. “Mom, why can’t Dad come in?”

###Chapter 202:
Averi, in his cartoon bear pajamas, his hair tousled, looked bewildered at the sight of Noah.
“Who is this man?”
Noah was taken aback, his attention shifting to Averi. As he observed the boy, who was about two or three, with deep, dark eyes resembling his own, his brow creased in thought.
Sadie felt a pang of anxiety. It was the wrong moment for Averi to emerge and pose such a question. She quickly stepped back, pulling Averi to her side to protect him from Noah’s intense stare.
Alex’s voice rose from outside, concerned. “Sadie, what’s happening? Should I call the police?”
Maintaining her calm was crucial; Sadie knew she must not let the situation escalate.
“Whose child is this boy?” Noah asked, his tone deep and stern, eyes never leaving Averi.
Sadie clenched her fists. “As you see, he’s my son with Alex.”
Noah’s expression turned visibly colder. Firmly, Sadie held his gaze.
Averi was clutching Sadie’s shirt, his eyes shifting uneasily from her to the tall figure in the doorway, visibly confused by the tension. He gently tugged on Sadie’s sleeve, his face marked by confusion and concern.
Wishing to end the confrontation, Sadie turned decisively toward the door, her voice resolute. “Mr. Wall, you need to leave now.”
Noah’s face contorted into a mix of disbelief and sarcasm. He swiftly grabbed her wrist.
As Sadie felt the sharp pain from his grip, she instinctively tried to wrench away. “Release me!”
Noah’s eyes hardened, piercing as he slowly demanded, “You owe me an explanation, Sadie.”

The pain in Sadie’s wrist intensified where his fingers clamped. “There’s nothing to explain. We are divorced. You have no say in my affairs,” she replied.
Noah scoffed coldly.
Abruptly, he drew her close, eliminating any gap between them, his breath warm against her skin.
Sadie’s heart thumped wildly with apprehension.
“Mom…”
Averi collapsed suddenly, his small body hitting the floor with a faint groan. The color drained from Sadie’s face, her expression one of stark alarm as she exclaimed, “Averi!”noveldrama
Noah, too, was caught off guard, his hand slipping from Sadie’s in shock.
Rushing to Averi’s side, Sadie scooped him up, her voice quivering with fear as she repeatedly called out, “Averi, Averi, what’s wrong?” Averi lay in her arms, his face ghostly pale and his eyes shut, offering no response.
A wave of dizziness overcame Sadie, her vision briefly clouding. All concerns about Noah faded as she clutched Averi close and opened the door of the apartment.
“Sadie!” As the door swung open, Alex, standing outside, was taken aback by the unfolding scene. The sight of Noah there was unexpected.
Spotting Alex, Sadie said, her voice shaking, “Alex, Averi is…” Without hesitation, Alex quickly took Averi from her arms, noticing how pale he was. “Let’s go!”
They sped downstairs, Noah left behind, standing alone.
Outside the hospital’s examination room, Sadie and Alex waited anxiously.
“Why hasn’t the doctor come out yet…” Sadie whispered.
After ten anxious minutes, a doctor in a white coat emerged from the room. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 203:
Rushing forward, Sadie asked, her voice rough with worry, “Doctor, how’s my son?”
The doctor, mask in hand, looked serious. “His fever isn’t subsiding, and the situation is concerning. It’s not a simple cold or fever. We recommend a bone marrow puncture to identify the cause.”
“A bone marrow puncture?” Sadie froze, filled with fear.
“The procedure is crucial for a quick diagnosis and effective treatment,” the doctor continued with patience. “It’s best we act swiftly.”
Dizziness hit Sadie again, her body nearly giving way.
Averi seemed too fragile for such an invasive test.
Sadie’s heart ached with an unbearable weight, making it hard to breathe.
Overwhelmed by worry, she managed to ask, “Isn’t there any other option? Must we do a bone marrow puncture?”
The doctor’s sigh indicated the gravity of the situation. “This is our best option at this moment.”
Alex approached, his hand comforting on Sadie’s shoulder. “Sadie, trust that the doctors will do their best for Averi.”
As Sadie looked into Alex’s eyes, her tears flowed freely. In the end, she signed the consent form with a trembling hand.
An hour had passed when Averi, still under anesthesia, was gently wheeled into his hospital room. Sadie, seated beside his bed, clutched his tiny hand, her eyes wide open throughout the night.
Outside the hospital, a sleek black Maybach sat silently by the curb, its interior bathed in soft light. Noah, brooding in the driver’s seat, held a cigarette loosely between his fingers. The echo of Sadie’s revelation haunted him: “Averi is my child with Alex.”
In a burst of anger, Noah flicked the cigarette butt into the night and pounded the steering wheel with his fist. He refused to accept this.
Taking a deep breath, he grabbed his phone and hastily dialed Samuel.
“Find out everything about Sadie’s child.”noveldrama
Samuel’s confusion was palpable. “Child? What child?”
Impatiently, Noah clarified, “Sadie’s child. He’s in the hospital. Investigate him! And fire Jordyn.”
With a heavy sigh, he ended the call and massaged his temples. Samuel, still bewildered, knew better than to probe further and started his investigation without delay.
In the morning, Kyla’s heels clicked sharply against the floor as she made her way back to Wall Group. Having completed her business trip, Kyla had arranged to return on the first available flight.
“Where’s Noah?” She glanced around, but the office was empty.
She tried calling him, only to be greeted by the monotonous tone of an automated message, saying, “Sorry, the number you’ve dialed is temporarily unavailable.”
With each repetition, a sinking feeling grew in Kyla’s chest, her unease mounting.
Stowing her phone, Kyla made her way toward Jordyn’s office. It was also empty, the desk neatly tidied up. A wave of apprehension caused Kyla’s heart to skip a beat.
She halted a colleague passing by. “Where’s Jordyn?” she inquired. The colleague paused briefly, then answered with caution, “She’s been fired, Miss Wade.”
“Fired?” Kyla was stunned. Jordyn’s sudden dismissal didn’t make sense. A nagging suspicion crept into her mind. Had Noah discovered something significant already?
At the hospital, Sadie remained beside Averi’s bed, her gaze fixed on her son’s small, pale face. Alex stayed beside her in silence, occasionally handing her a glass of water and murmuring a few reassuring words.

###Chapter 204:
“Sadie, Averi is going to be alright,” Alex said gently.
She gave a slight nod, her eyes brimming with unshed tears. “Alex, I really appreciate you staying. I don’t know how I would do this alone.”
“We’re friends. It’s the least I can do. And to me, Averi is like my child,” Alex replied.
Sadie hesitated for a moment but chose not to say anything. A brief stillness settled in the room before she returned her focus to Averi.
Meanwhile, Noah had been sitting in his car near the hospital entrance for hours, his frustration intensifying with each passing second. The idea that Averi was Sadie and Alex’s child seemed unthinkable, yet Sadie’s unwavering stance made him question everything. No matter what, he needed clarity.
Turning the key, he drove toward the hospital’s parking area. Throughout the drive, he couldn’t shake the image of Averi’s delicate features and Sadie’s anxious expression from his mind. His grip on the wheel tightened, his foot pressing harder on the gas as his thoughts spiraled.
Just as Kyla was about to exit the office, Samuel rushed inside. He halted upon spotting her but quickly masked his surprise.
“Miss Wade, why are you here?”
“I’m looking for Noah. Do you know where he went?”
Samuel hesitated slightly before responding, “Mr. Wall… he’s likely in the hospital.”
“The hospital? Why would he go there?”
Kyla’s pulse quickened, an uneasiness creeping over her.
Samuel lowered his head, offering no explanation.
Noticing his reluctance, Kyla grew even more confused. She didn’t press further, instead spinning on her heel and hailing a cab straight to the hospital.
A while later, inside the hospital room, Averi slowly regained consciousness. His eyelids fluttered open, and he saw his mother’s tear-streaked face. In a faint voice, he asked, “Mom, what happened?”
Exclusive stories galησvlcom
A rush of emotion filled Sadie’s chest when she heard his voice, and tears streamed freely down her cheeks. She embraced him tightly. “Averi, you’re awake! You had a high fever, but everything is fine now.”
Averi blinked drowsily. “Mom, I feel okay. Where’s that man?”
Sadie tensed for a second. She knew exactly who he meant—Noah. Not wanting him entangled in the complicated situation, she replied, “He had to leave for something important. Don’t worry. Just rest.”
Though confused, Averi nodded obediently. He nestled into his mother’s arms and soon drifted back to sleep.
Sadie gently laid him back down before stepping into the corridor for some fresh air. As she reached the corridor’s end, she spotted Noah striding toward her.
“Why are you here?” Sadie frowned, her expression guarded.
Noah’s eyes locked onto hers, his tone cool and unwavering. “I came to get answers about the boy.”
“I already told you. It’s none of your business. Just go and don’t come back.”
Sadie turned to head back to the ward, but Noah caught her arm firmly. “Sadie, you won’t shake me off that easily. I need to know the truth about this child,” he said, his voice firm.
“Let go of me!” Sadie struggled to break free from his grip. “Noah, we’re no longer married. You have no say in my life anymore.”
Just as the tension between them was at its peak, Kyla arrived at the hospital.
The moment she saw Noah and Sadie together, her temper flared. “Noah, what’s going on? Is she bothering you again?” Kyla asked, her tone deceptively sweet but laced with irritation.

###Chapter 205:
Noah cast a fleeting glance at her but remained silent. His thoughts were entirely occupied with Averi, leaving Kyla’s presence barely registering in his mind.
When Kyla noticed his indifference, her hands balled into tight fists. She then turned to Sadie, eyes burning with contempt, as if silently accusing her of being shameless. How could this woman, already divorced from Noah, still be entangled with him?
Sadie let out a short, derisive laugh, her lips curling into a smirk. “Kyla, let’s get one thing straight. He came to me. I’m not the one running after him.”
“You…” Kyla’s fury spiked so intensely that words failed her.
Her gaze flickered toward the slight opening in the door, and she caught a glimpse of the child inside. So, Noah had met the child. No, she couldn’t just stand by and let things be!
“That’s enough!” Noah’s voice cut through the tension, sharp and commanding.
He turned to Sadie, his expression a storm of emotions. “I’ll ask you one last time—who is this child’s father?”
Sadie drew in a slow breath, forcing herself to stay composed. Locking eyes with him, she responded evenly, “I’ve already told you. Averi is my child with Alex. If you don’t believe me, get a paternity test done.” A flicker of tension passed through Noah as he registered the unwavering certainty in her gaze.
Nearby, Kyla pursed her lips before speaking in a honeyed tone. “Noah, your mother invited us to dinner at the Wall Manor tonight. Since Sadie has personal matters to handle, why don’t we go on ahead?”
Noah, frustration mounting, turned to her. “Go without me.”
“Noah…” Kyla began, but catching the irritation in his tone, she decided against pushing further. Instead, she shot one final glare at Sadie before spinning on her heel and marching out of the hospital. Noah watched her retreat, then exhaled heavily, rubbing a hand over his face.
Noah turned to Sadie and said, “I’ll investigate this thoroughly. If…”
g?lnσν?s?com delivers what you seek
“There’s no ‘if,'” Sadie cut him off sharply. “Alex and I are Averi’s parents. Stop daydreaming.”
Noah fell silent, turned, and left the hospital without another word. Sadie’s gaze lingered on his departing figure, a tumult of bitterness and determination swirling within her. She knew this wasn’t the end of it, but her resolve to protect Averi remained unwavering.
In the hospital room, Alex noticed the redness and swelling around Sadie’s eyes, feeling a twinge of concern. “Sadie, what happened?” he asked softly.
“It’s nothing, just a misunderstanding,” Sadie replied.
Meanwhile, after leaving the hospital, Kyla was gripped by panic. How had things escalated so quickly during her brief absence? Noah had even refused dinner at Wall Manor for that woman.
Impatient, Kyla urged the driver, “Sir, please, can you go faster?” Catching her anxious expression in the rearview mirror, the driver wordlessly accelerated.
Kyla’s heart raced as she pondered the potential fallout if Noah discovered the truth about the child. The implications were dire, and she felt compelled to intervene before things spiraled further.
Upon arriving at Wall Manor, Kyla hurriedly paid the fare and dashed inside.
Isabel was in the living room, appearing serene with a cup of coffee in hand. Noticing Kyla’s rushed entrance, Isabel offered a warm smile. “Kyla, there you are. Why are you so late? Where’s Noah?” she inquired, her concern evident as she placed her coffee cup down.
Approaching Isabel, Kyla took her arm and said softly, “Mrs. Wall, Noah was held up by an urgent matter at the office. He’ll be a bit late.”
Isabel patted Kyla’s hand reassuringly, her tone both comforting and assertive. “That boy is always buried in work. He really needs to watch his health.”

###Chapter 206:
Kyla let out a forced smile, yet her eyes reddened slightly as if she were holding back tears.
Isabel, ever perceptive, immediately sensed something was amiss. “Kyla, what’s wrong? Did Noah upset you?” she asked, her voice laden with concern.
Kyla shook her head slightly and sighed, hesitating.
“If something’s bothering you, you should tell me. Don’t keep it all to yourself,” Isabel urged, patting her hand gently.
Kyla seemed to muster her resolve, biting her lip before speaking in a hushed tone. “Mrs. Wall, I… I ran into Sadie at the hospital today.”
“Sadie?” Isabel’s expression tightened, her voice tinged with displeasure.
“Yes, Sadie. She’s with Alex. And… and…”
“And what?” Isabel pressed, her impatience mounting as she picked up her coffee cup again.
Kyla took a deep breath, looking like she was gathering her courage.
“They have a son. He’s about three years old.”
“A son? Are you certain?”
Isabel’s hands trembled, causing her coffee cup to tilt, spilling some of its contents onto her hand, but she seemed not to notice.
Kyla quickly snatched a few tissues and dabbed at Isabel’s hand. “Be careful, Mrs. Wall,” she murmured softly.
Isabel sat stunned, her eyes glazed as if struggling to grasp the revelation.
Kyla bowed her head, and tears finally spilled over, dotting Isabel’s hand.
Isabel, jolted back to reality, clasped Kyla’s hand tightly, her grip firm. “What did you say? Say it again!”
L€$? tя? Iη ?a?n?νεl?.c?m
Kyla stifled a sob and said, “I saw it myself. They had a child with them, a little boy, about three years old. He… he resembles Alex.”
Isabel’s face paled, her breathing heavy with rising anger. She stood abruptly and began to pace the living room, murmuring, “How could this happen… How could something like this happen?”
Tears rolled down Kyla’s cheeks.noveldrama
Isabel stopped in her tracks, gesturing toward the door as she yelled, “That shameless bitch! She’s a complete seductress! I knew she was up to no good with Noah!”
Kyla gently took hold of Isabel’s sleeve and whispered, “Please, don’t be upset. It’s not worth it.”
Angrily, Isabel jerked her hand away, asking, “How can I not be? Sadie has tricked Noah, and she even…”
Overcome with anger, Isabel found herself unable to finish her thoughts, her cheeks flushed with fury.
Quick to offer solace, Kyla placed a gentle hand on Isabel’s back, trying to calm her. “Please, calm down. We don’t have all the details yet. Perhaps there’s been some mistake.”
Rejecting the comfort, Isabel shoved Kyla’s hand away, retorting, “A mistake? She has a child with her! How could that be a mistake?” The force of Isabel’s push made Kyla stumble, fresh tears gathering in her eyes.
Bowing her head, Kyla murmured softly, “Don’t worry. It might merely be a coincidence.”
With a dismissive laugh, Isabel replied, “A coincidence? Are we really to believe that such coincidences exist? Sadie has always been a schemer. I figured her out a long time ago!”
Kyla chose silence, pressing her lips together. Isabel, noticing her vulnerable expression, felt a twinge of compassion. She enveloped Kyla in a warm embrace, rubbing her back gently as she said, “Could this be the reason why Noah didn’t come with you? Don’t worry. You have my full support, Kyla.” 
.

###Chapter 207:
A slight smirk passed fleetingly across Kyla’s face as she leaned into Isabel’s hug.
Taking Kyla’s hand firmly, Isabel led the way with urgency, pulling her along.
Kyla struggled to keep pace with Isabel, her breathing uneven. Despite this, she managed a serene smile and occasionally said, “Let’s slow down a bit. We wouldn’t want you to trip.”
Isabel seemed deaf to Kyla’s concerns. Visions of Sadie and Alex, with their three-year-old child, fueled her growing rage. She was eager to confront Noah and demand answers directly.
The sprawling Myrtlewood Estate loomed majestically ahead. Upon their arrival, the butler, Breck Wagner, immediately approached them with a swift greeting. “Mrs. Wall, Miss Wade, welcome.” He was about to call Noah when he heard the sound of footsteps at the grand entrance.
Noah had returned.
Dressed in a sharp, dark gray suit that accentuated his lean stature, Noah looked both weary and commanding. Though there was a slight weariness in his eyes, he still carried an air of authority.
Isabel’s temper reached its peak when she saw him. Abruptly releasing Kyla’s hand, she marched straight to Noah, her voice filled with accusation. “Noah! You need to explain now! What is this mess with Sadie all about?”
Noah’s brow furrowed in confusion. He was taken aback by both Isabel’s tone and her unexpected question. “Mom, why are you so upset? What happened?”
Isabel’s sneer was sharp as she retorted, “You’re asking what happened? Tell me, Noah, did Sadie cheat on you and have a child with Alex?”noveldrama
Noah’s face hardened, and his eyes narrowed. “What nonsense are you talking about?”
At that moment, Kyla moved closer to Isabel, gently pulling at her sleeve and whispering, “Please, try to stay calm and speak with Noah without being angry.”
Every journey starts at g?lnσν?s﹒о
Isabel turned to Kyla, her face twisted in distress. After a deep breath, she managed to regain control and, pointing towards Kyla, she turned to Noah. “Take a good look at how great Kyla is. She’s gentle, virtuous, and well-mannered. When do you plan to marry her so we can finally be at peace?”
Noah glanced at Kyla briefly before addressing Isabel. “Mom, let me manage my own affairs.”
Isabel’s temper flared again. “Let you? And how well has that worked out for you? Sadie has tricked you! She’s had a child with another man, yet you continue to defend her!”
Noah’s expression darkened, his lips tightly sealed as he chose not to respond.
Tears began to well up in Kyla’s eyes as she whispered, “Please stop fighting. This is all my fault…”
Isabel pulled Kyla into an embrace, shooting a stern look at Noah. “You’ve let me down! I insist you divorce Sadie and marry Kyla immediately!”
The atmosphere in the living room grew heavy and oppressive.
“Mom, I’ll handle it. Please, go back and rest.”
Isabel’s anger escalated when she heard his calm response. “What kind of attitude is that? I’m just worried about you, and here you are—”
“Mrs. Wall…” Kyla interrupted softly, halting Isabel’s words. “Noah surely has his reasons. Let’s go back now and not make this harder for him.”
Kyla spoke softly, gently tugging at Isabel’s sleeve.
Isabel felt a pang in her heart, recognizing Kyla’s sensibility and consideration. She sighed and turned to Noah, her voice heavy with resignation. “Noah, you are on your own now. Take care.” With those parting words, she left.
Just as Kyla was about to follow, Noah’s cold voice halted her.
She paused and turned back, her expression filled with confusion.
“About what Jordyn and Beccy did, are you involved?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 208:
Kyla froze for a moment, a brief flicker of panic crossing her face before she masked it with an innocent expression. “Noah, what are you talking about? I’ve just returned from Amberhollow. I don’t know anything. What did Jordyn and Beccy do?”
Her eyes widened as she feigned complete ignorance.
Noah studied her carefully, searching her face for any sign of deceit. After a moment, he let it go.
Kyla’s act was convincing as always.
He sneered inwardly but maintained a stoic exterior. “It’s nothing. You can leave.”
Relieved, Kyla exhaled softly and said gently, “Then get some rest. Good night.”
She exited the villa, her high heels echoing against the floor.
Outside, Kyla quickly pulled out her phone and made a call. The line connected, and a tearful voice filled her ear. “Miss Wade…” It was Jordyn.
Kyla’s voice turned cold, devoid of any sympathy. “Stop crying! Did you complete the task or not?”
“Miss Wade, I’ve lost my job, and Beccy has been taken away. I—”
“Idiots!” Kyla snapped mercilessly. “You couldn’t even manage something this simple.”
Her fingers tightened around the phone, her nails digging into her palm. Kyla had planned everything with precision to tarnish Sadie’s reputation, yet Jordyn hadn’t done her part properly.
Subdued by Kyla’s rebuke, Jordyn stifled her sobs, reducing them to quiet sniffles.
“Enough! Stop crying!” Kyla snapped, her impatience clear. “Crying won’t fix this. Listen carefully to what you need to do next…”
She lowered her voice to a sinister whisper, outlining the subsequent phases of her scheme.

As the night deepened, the streetlights cast Kyla’s shadow across the pavement, elongating it into a sinister silhouette.
She ended the call, her expression swiftly shifting back to one of calm poise, the very image of refined elegance.
Regaining her composure, she walked toward the car waiting by the roadside. She needed rest; tomorrow promised another scene in her elaborate scheme.
Kyla slid into the car, and the driver ignited the engine.
Meanwhile, in the hospital, the stark white lights bathed Sadie in a pale glow, making her complexion appear almost ghostly.
Her hands gripped the bone marrow puncture report, her knuckles turning white.noveldrama
The doctor adjusted his glasses, his voice heavy with gravity. “Miss Hudson, your child’s condition is quite severe. He’s been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A bone marrow transplant is imperative at this stage.”
Sadie’s lips quivered, her voice barely a whisper. “Doctor, is there truly no alternative?”
The doctor exhaled deeply. “I’m afraid there’s no other viable treatment. We need a transplant, and the best chance for a match comes from the child’s biological father.”
“Biological father…” Sadie murmured the words, the realization hitting her like a thunderclap, echoing in her mind.
Her heart clenched painfully, the ache radiating through her chest.
The child’s biological father was Noah.
But she couldn’t let him find out Averi was his son. Not ever. If Noah knew Averi was his, based on his current attitude toward her, Sadie feared he would take Averi away.
And with his upcoming marriage to Kyla, Averi would inevitably be caught in the crossfire.
As Sadie struggled to control her emotions, her voice came out hoarse. “Doctor, is there any alternative aside from the child’s biological father?”
The doctor met her gaze, his eyes reflecting a trace of pity. “We can search the bone marrow registry, though it’s less likely to find a match.”

###Chapter 209:
“Find a match quickly.” Sadie slumped back into her chair, feeling a profound exhaustion wash over her.
What was her next step?
“Please start with the registry search,” she managed to say, her voice dry and strained.
The doctor nodded sympathetically.
Seeing such a young mother, weary and anxious, stirred a deep sympathy in him.
Sadie returned to Averi’s hospital room and pushed the door open.
Averi lay on the bed, his complexion pale and delicate.
Alex was beside him, a storybook in hand, though his eyes weren’t moving across the page. His expression was etched with worry. At the sound of the door, Alex looked up and stood immediately upon seeing Sadie.
“You’re back, Sadie,” he murmured gently.
Sadie mustered a weak smile and walked to the bedside, tenderly stroking Averi’s cheek.
Alex noticed the test report in her hand, took it, and read through it quickly. His face paled as the gravity of the situation set in. He understood perfectly what it meant.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia… Bone marrow transplant.
Alex’s gaze met Sadie’s, laden with a swirl of emotions. “Sadie, I’ll do everything I can to find a donor match.”
Tears welled up in Sadie’s eyes, but she fought to keep them at bay.noveldrama
“I’ve caused you so much trouble, Alex,” she whispered.
A wave of bitterness washed over her. She knew she could never repay his kindness in this lifetime.

Alex offered a weak smile, maintaining a light tone. “Please, don’t worry about it, Sadie. We’re friends.” He glanced toward Averi, who was resting quietly on the hospital bed. “I’m going to leave now. Take care of yourself and try to rest.”
Sadie nodded, too overwhelmed to speak.
Alex turned and left, closing the door softly behind him.
The tears Sadie had been suppressing finally cascaded down her cheeks.
Her phone’s shrill ring cut through the silence of the ward that afternoon.
Exhausted, Sadie answered the call. The caller ID showed “Kyla.”
“Sadie, the design drafts for Timeless Love need revisions. You need to come back immediately,” Kyla demanded.
Sadie was stunned by Kyla’s words.
Averi was still lying in his hospital bed; leaving him was unthinkable. “I can’t leave right now. I’ll have one of my studio’s designers handle the revisions.”
“The collaboration isn’t finished, and you think it’s appropriate to send a designer in your place?” Kyla’s tone was cutting, filled with disdain.
Sadie clenched her fists, quelling the anger bubbling inside her. “When I submitted the drafts, there were no ions. Now, a week later, you demand revisions? Miss Wade, your request is completely unreasonable.”
“You…” Kyla was so furious she could barely speak. “You’ll regret this, Sadie Hudson. Mark my words!”
“Miss Wade, I will address the design draft issue as soon as possible, but right now, my priority is to be at the hospital with my son.”
A long silence followed, then Kyla’s voice returned, oozing malice. “Fine, Sadie. Just you wait.”
The call ended with a series of sharp beeps reverberating through the room.
Exhausted, Sadie slumped against the bed’s edge, her phone slipping from her grasp.
She was certain Kyla wouldn’t let this go easily.

###Chapter 210:
Meanwhile, Kyla, overcome with fury, slammed her phone down on the desk. She hadn’t expected Sadie to challenge her so boldly. Yet Sadie’s defiance unwittingly played into her hands. Knowing Sadie couldn’t leave the hospital, Kyla had strategically timed her demand to maximize the pressure, hoping to throw Sadie off balance.
Regaining her composure, Kyla picked up her phone and dialed another number. “Hello, Korbin. Proceed with the Timeless Love lawsuit. Use the materials I prepared to sue Sadie’s studio for breach of contract. Claim the drafts are substandard and accuse them of unprofessionalism. I want her reputation destroyed, dragged through the mud.”
She paused, her tone growing even colder. “Do it swiftly and without mercy. I want her to face severe consequences, and quickly.”
The voice on the other end responded with deference, “Understood, Miss Wade. I’ll initiate the proceedings immediately.”noveldrama
Kyla ended the call and turned to her desk, pulling out a folder. She flipped through the pages one by one, a triumphant smile spreading across her face.
Kyla wasn’t merely intent on ruining Sadie’s career; she aimed to strip her of everything.
Clutching the documents for the Amberhollow project, Kyla prepared to update Noah.
“Noah, about the Amberhollow project…” She pushed open the door to the CEO’s office, but her voice faded.
Noah was standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, his tall figure silhouetted against the backdrop of light. His back was to her as he issued instructions to Samuel in a low, commanding tone.
“Ensure this is completed promptly. I expect nothing but the most precise results.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded with deference, then turned to leave. He acknowledged Kyla with a brief nod as he passed her at the doorway.
Kyla paused, her grip on the documents tightening.
The snippets of Samuel’s earlier conversation with Noah echoed in her mind, stirring a wave of dread.
Noah turned and noticed Kyla lingering at the door, his expression shifting to slight confusion.
Kyla masked her anxiety with a forced smile. “Noah—”
Before she could continue, Noah interrupted. “I was just about to call you in.”
He approached his desk, retrieved a file, and handed it to her. “Review the latest proposal for the Amberhollow project.”
As Kyla took the file, her thoughts still lingered on Samuel. Could it be possible? Was Noah contemplating a paternity test?
“Kyla, is something wrong?” Noah’s inquiry snapped her back to reality.
“No, nothing,” she responded quickly, putting on another smile. “I’m just a bit tired.”
Kyla placed the file on the desk. “Noah, I have something to handle. Please excuse me.”
With that, she turned and hurried out of the office, her steps faltering slightly under the weight of her thoughts.
Meanwhile, at the hospital, Sadie’s slender fingers clutched her phone tightly, the screen displaying a news article about Wall Group suing her studio.
They’ve actually gone through with suing my studio… Was this all part of their calculated plan?
Just then, Pierre burst through the door, clutching a tablet, urgency marking his voice. “Miss Hudson, bad news! Wall Group has officially filed a lawsuit against our studio, demanding astronomical compensation. It’s all over the internet.”
Pierre’s face mirrored his concern as he noted Sadie’s pallor, his anxiety intensifying.
Sadie took the tablet from him. “I already know. There’s no need to panic. We’ll tackle these challenges as they come.” Pierre paused, taken aback by her calm in the face of crisis. 
.

###Chapter 211:
Sadie rose to her feet. “Pierre,” she said, her voice firm, “contact our lawyer immediately and prepare for the lawsuit. Also, gather all the original design drafts and related materials for Timeless Love. I want to review everything personally.”
“Understood, Miss Hudson.” Pierre nodded, his initial panic easing.noveldrama
To manage the workload, Sadie set up a makeshift workstation beside the hospital bed. She sat beside the bed, one hand softly stroking Averi’s hair, while her other hand held a stylus. She sketched intently on the worktable.
The studio had been reeling from one crisis to another. The project with Lawrence Group was her last beacon of hope. Completing this project was crucial to preserving her studio’s reputation.
“Mommy…” Averi’s soft, sleepy voice interrupted the silence as he blinked open his groggy eyes.
“You’re awake, sweetheart?” Sadie set down her stylus and leaned over to kiss his forehead. “Are you feeling okay?”
“Yes.” Averi nodded his head, his small hand gripping the hem of her blouse. “Mommy, what are you doing?”
“Mommy’s working. Be a good boy and go back to sleep, okay?” Averi nodded obediently and closed his eyes again.
Watching her son comply so sweetly filled Sadie’s heart with warmth. She picked up the stylus once more, her expression one of unwavering determination.
As time passed in the silent ward, the only sound was the soft scratching of Sadie’s stylus on the paper.
Outside, the sky darkened, and the room’s light faded into twilight. Yet, Sadie remained completely engrossed in her designing, oblivious to the passage of time.
Gradually, her hand became heavy, and the stylus wavered, tracing an uneven line across the paper. Dizziness overwhelmed her suddenly, blurring the room into a swirling haze.
“Sadie!” Alex’s voice broke through the fog, sharp with urgency.
Your update hub: g?lησv?ls?c?m
Sadie’s body began to slump backward, powerless to resist the fatigue. Just in time, Alex caught her, easing her gently into the chair beside the bed.
“Are you okay?” His voice was thick with concern.
Sadie tried to focus, nodding her head weakly. “I’m fine, just a bit tired.” Her voice was faint, her face ashen.
Alex frowned, his concern deepening as he touched her forehead, finding it unexpectedly hot. “You have a fever.”
As Sadie’s awareness faded, her breaths becoming shallow and labored, she struggled to keep her eyes open.
Alex watched helplessly as she drifted into unconsciousness, his heart aching with worry.
He carefully lifted her and moved her to the other hospital bed, tucking her in gently.
At a testing facility, a woman cloaked in secrecy moved swiftly through the corridor. She was disguised in oversized sunglasses and a scarf that hid most of her face, leaving only a small patch of skin visible.
Her steps were quick, punctuated by nervous glances over her shoulder, as if she feared being recognized.
Jordyn’s heart raced, and her palms were damp with perspiration. She couldn’t fathom why Kyla had tasked her with such a dubious act—switching files? It certainly didn’t seem like it could lead to anything benign.
She paused in front of an office door, inhaled deeply, and pushed it open.
The office was deserted, except for a sealed manila envelope on the desk.
Jordyn swiftly pulled an identical envelope from her bag, swapped it with the one on the desk, and tucked the original into her bag. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 212:
Without wasting another moment, she exited the office.
The corridor was unsettlingly silent.
Jordyn rushed to the stairwell, checked to ensure no one was in sight, and then sighed in relief.
She removed her disguise, revealing a delicate face framed by long, jet-black hair that fell over her shoulders, accentuating her beautiful features. Yet, at this moment, her face was marred by confusion and apprehension.
Jordyn pulled the swapped file from her bag, hesitated, then opened it. Inside was a single sheet of paper, prominently labeled “Paternity Test Report.”
Paternity test?
Why would Kyla involve her in swapping such a document? What was really going on?
Jordyn’s mind was tangled with conflicting thoughts.
Kyla had instructed her to swap the documents, indicating that something underhanded was afoot.
Whose paternity test was this?
Kyla’s deep involvement suggested it concerned Noah—she wouldn’t go to such lengths for anyone else.
But how was this paternity test connected to Noah?
Chewing on her lower lip, Jordyn entertained a bold suspicion.
It was always wise to have a backup plan.
She quickly hid the genuine paternity test report in a compartment of her handbag, then placed a blank document she had prepared earlier into the file bag.
Once everything was in place, Jordyn pulled out her phone and called Kyla.

“Hello, Kyla. The task is complete,” Jordyn said in a subdued tone, her voice tinged with a hint of anxiety.
On the other end, Kyla’s response was warm with satisfaction. “Excellent. Well done! Your payment will be processed shortly.” Jordyn breathed a silent sigh of relief.
“Oh, by the way, Jordyn,” Kyla added after a brief pause, “regarding the design director position at Alice Design Studio I mentioned before, I’ve put in a good word for you. Expect a call for an interview in the next few days.”
Alice Design Studio?
That was a premier firm in the design industry.
Joy surged through Jordyn, and she couldn’t help but smile broadly. “Really? Thank you so much, Kyla! I’m incredibly grateful!”
“There are more opportunities ahead if you keep up the good work,” Kyla concluded before ending the call.
As Jordyn clutched her phone, a subtle smile played on her lips. Standing by the roadside, she observed the lively flow of traffic, her mind racing with thoughts.
She glanced at the authentic report hidden in her handbag.
This document might just serve as valuable leverage in the future.
A brisk wind caused Jordyn to shudder.
She pulled her coat tighter around her, flagged down a taxi, and disappeared into the city’s ceaseless traffic.
The following morning at Wall Group, Noah sat behind his expansive desk, his long fingers rhythmically tapping the surface.
Samuel respectfully placed a document in front of him. “Mr. Wall, here’s the paternity test report you requested.”
Noah picked up the document, his expression tightening as a hint of anticipation flickered in his eyes.

###Chapter 213:
He quickly scanned the paper, his eyes settling on the final conclusion: no biological connection.
The document slipped from his grasp, landing softly on the polished desk.
Noah’s face clouded over instantly.
He closed his eyes, struggling to contain the surge of emotions within him.
No biological connection…
Was the child truly Alex’s?
The sound of high heels approached, growing louder. Kyla entered, her elegant white suit highlighting her poised figure.
Her lips curled into a controlled smile, her eyes gleaming subtly.
“Noah, I’ve just finalized the proposal for the Amberhollow project…” She stopped mid-sentence as her gaze landed on the document on the desk.
“Is this… a paternity test report?” She feigned shock, bringing a hand to her mouth, a quick flash of satisfaction in her eyes.
Noah remained silent, his icy stare fixed on her.
Kyla approached the desk, lifted the report, and glanced over it before looking up with a pretense of concern.
“No biological connection?” she murmured. “Noah, what… what does this mean?”
The atmosphere in the office turned icy, time seeming to stand still. Noah stood abruptly, his movement sending his chair skidding back with a screech.
His face was pale, his lips pressed tightly together.
Kyla’s voice softened as she feigned concern. “Noah, are you okay?”
Ignoring her, Noah strode towards the office door, his steps resolute.
L?t?st cнαpt?rs ιn glnov?ls.
Samuel hastened after him, his footsteps echoing in the tense silence. Kyla watched Noah’s departure, a subtle smirk playing at the corners of her mouth.
She gently placed the paternity test report back on the desk.
Everything was unfolding exactly as she had planned.
However, as long as that boy was alive, he remained a potential threat.
Kyla pulled out her phone and dialed a number.
“Hello, has it been taken care of?”
“It’s been done as you instructed. The information has been spread,” responded a respectful voice from the other end.
Meanwhile, in Alex’s office, the faint aroma of coffee filled the air. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, the bustling cityscape of Jazmah stretched out impressively.
Alex set down his phone, a satisfied smile touching his lips.
He had just reached out to a top transplant specialist overseas. Now, Averi had a real chance, and a weight lifted from Alex’s shoulders.
He turned to look at Sadie, who was seated on the sofa.
Her face was pale, and despite her efforts to look strong, her weariness was evident.
“Sadie, good news. I’ve secured a consultation with Professor David Miller in Maradeiris for Averi. It’ll happen soon,” Alex said softly, his voice soothing.noveldrama
Tears welled up in Sadie’s eyes at his words. She looked at Alex with deep gratitude. “Alex, thank you. I can’t tell you how much this means.”
“No need to thank me,” Alex said, his smile gentle. “I consider Averi as my own.”
He moved to sit next to Sadie and reached out for her hand, only for her to subtly withdraw it.
With a lowered gaze, Sadie’s long lashes concealed the emotions in her eyes.
The warmth of Alex’s kindness touched her heart, yet it deepened her guilt. She knew she was deeply indebted to him.

###Chapter 214:
Suddenly, the office door burst open with a resounding bang, slicing through the silence.
Noah appeared in the doorway, his expression stormy, resembling a tempest poised to burst.
His gaze locked onto Sadie and Alex, who were seated close on the sofa, their hands almost touching. Noah’s breath caught at the sight.
He marched over, grabbed Sadie by the arm, and pulled her up so forcefully that she cried out in pain.
“How dare you, Sadie?” Noah exclaimed, each word slicing through the air with fury.
Sadie’s face contorted in pain as she pulled her arm away from Noah. “What are you thinking, Noah?” she demanded, her voice cold yet defiant.
Her body was frail, but her stare was resolute, betraying no fear.
Alex stood quickly, positioning himself between Sadie and Noah. “Calm down, Noah. Sadie is unwell,” he said, his voice calm but assertive.
Noah’s sneer was venomous as he glared at Alex. “Back off. This is between her and me.”
He pushed Alex away and drew Sadie back to him, his eyes burning into hers.
“Answer me! Who is Averi’s father?”
Sadie returned his intense gaze without flinching.
Yet, she hesitated briefly. Had Noah done a paternity test?
“What makes you think that I would lie to you? Averi is my child with Alex. Do you have an issue with that?”
The look on Noah’s face turned even more ominous.
He tightened his grip on Sadie’s wrist.

“You need to be honest with me, Sadie! Or else…”
With a scornful scoff, Sadie jerked her arm away from him. “Or else what? We are no longer married, Noah. You don’t get to control my life anymore!”
Shock widened Noah’s eyes.
He seized her wrist once more, forcefully pulling her away from Alex.
“Come with me!”
His voice was cold, carrying an air of finality.
He began to pull her towards the door without waiting for her to reply.
With a powerful tug, Sadie freed her arm, staggering but quickly regaining her balance.
Noah paused, his hand freezing in midair.
It seemed he hadn’t anticipated resistance from Sadie.
Panting, Sadie fought to stabilize her breathing and keep her emotions in check as she tried not to cry.
“You shouldn’t make this harder for yourself,” Noah said with clear warning. “Do you still want to keep your studio?”
Despair gripped Sadie. Her studio was her passion, built with immense effort and dedication. Noah’s threat pierced her deeply. He had the means to ruin her studio without breaking a sweat.
Sadie’s hands clenched tightly, her nails pressing into her palms. Looking Noah in the eyes, she spoke with measured calm. “Do you actually think I’m scared of you, Noah?”noveldrama
Her voice was low yet resonant, each syllable delivered with undeniable power.
A hush fell over the room, the only sound their quickened breathing. Noah’s eyebrow quirked upwards. “Your precious little studio… Do you honestly believe you can keep it?”
“No matter what, I won’t let you get your way,” she replied, her tone imbued with fierce determination. 
.

###Chapter 215:
The resolve in her eyes only served to aggravate Noah further. “Wake up and face reality, Sadie!” he retorted sharply.
“You need to leave,” Alex said, his worry for Sadie apparent as he noted the reddening of her wrist from Noah’s grip.
He moved to shield Sadie from Noah, his voice solid and commanding. “Noah, this is way out of line.”
A scoff escaped Noah, cold and mocking. “Mr. Howe, why are you so eager to meddle?”
Sadie gave a slight shake of her head, gently pulling at Alex’s sleeve. Engaging further with Noah seemed futile now.
Kyla’s lawsuit against her studio had been suspiciously timely. Sadie was now convinced it was all orchestrated by Noah to bend her to his will.
Turning to Alex, Sadie murmured, “We should leave.”
With a subtle nod, Alex gave Noah a final stern look before leading Sadie away from the confrontation.
Noah remained stationary, his gaze following them as they left, yet he made no move to follow.
Once outside, Sadie breathed more freely, the weight of the confrontation lifting slightly.
“Alex, I’m sorry for causing you more trouble,” Sadie murmured, her voice tinged with fatigue.noveldrama
Alex studied her, concern evident in his gaze.
His hand lifted slightly, almost touching the faint bruise on her wrist where Noah had grabbed her, but he hesitated midway. He simply exhaled and shook his head. “Enough with the apologies. Do we really need to act so distant?”
Sadie looked away, avoiding his stare.
?@?€?? ￠?  g?lnove?s.c
Alex caught the flicker of sorrow in her expression, and his worry grew. “Let me take you home. You don’t seem well.”
Sadie shook her head, her tone unwavering. “No, I need to check on Averi at the hospital. I hired a caregiver, but I still can’t put my mind at ease.”
Kyla’s swift actions had kept Sadie on edge, and Noah’s involvement had only made the situation even more unbearable.
Alex hesitated briefly before saying in a quiet voice, “Just… be cautious, alright? And if you need anything, don’t think twice about reaching out to me.”
He knew better than to argue—once Sadie made a decision, nothing would sway her.
She offered a faint, weary smile. “I will.”
Turning on her heel, she stepped into the elevator.
As the doors slid shut, Noah emerged from Alex’s office, his imposing frame casting a cold shadow. His expression was unreadable, sharp, and distant.
Alex remained still, a hint of irony in his smirk.
“The Floral Whisper Project… appreciate it, Mr. Wall,” he remarked, his tone edged with sarcasm.
Noah’s stare was frigid, cutting through the space between them like a knife. The tension in the air thickened.
“Stay out of her life. Otherwise, I’ll ensure your family disappears from Jazmah.”
Without another word, he turned and walked away, never glancing back.
Alex watched him go, his smirk fading, replaced by a contemplative expression. Noah’s threats didn’t intimidate him—his only concern was Sadie. A cautious voice broke the silence. “Sir, are you sure you want to stay involved with Miss Hudson? Our partner’s withdrawal from the Floral Whisper project is a clear warning from Wall Group.”
The quiet of the office was punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the clock. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 216:
Alex remained motionless, lost in thought for a brief moment.
“So what if they back out? Do you think I’m scared of Noah?” His voice was calm yet resolute. “Sadie and Averi need my support, and I refuse to abandon them.”
His assistant observed him with newfound respect. Though Alex often seemed indifferent, deep down, he was a man who valued loyalty and cared deeply for those close to him.
At the hospital, the elevator doors slid open, and as Sadie stepped out, the sharp scent of antiseptic filled her lungs, adding to the weight in her chest. The hospital corridor was bustling with people. Pulling her coat tighter around herself, she quickened her steps toward Averi’s room. Beneath the sterile hospital lighting, her slender frame appeared even more delicate.
She focused on steadying her breath, determined not to let Averi see the unease she was struggling to conceal.
Just as she neared the pediatric ward, a familiar voice called her name.
She glanced up to see Jim approaching.
He was dressed in a white coat and holding a patient’s chart, his expression gentle but filled with concern.
“Dr. Archer,” Sadie greeted with a strained smile.
The last thing she wanted was for Jim to notice how vulnerable she felt.
But he caught the exhaustion in her eyes, the forced curve of her lips, and his brow creased slightly. “You’re here again? Are you alright?”
“It’s Averi… He’s unwell and had to be admitted.”
Jim’s face turned serious in an instant. “What’s wrong? Is it severe?”
“The doctors diagnosed him with acute lymphoblastic leukemia…” Sadie’s voice wavered, barely audible by the end.
Jim was stunned. He knew exactly what that disease was.
Sadie was momentarily taken aback by Jim’s words.
She lowered her head, her voice rough. “Dr. Archer, I’m aware.”
Jim studied her carefully, his eyes searching for clarity. He knew she was smart—there was no way she was unaware.
“You are?” he asked.
Sadie lifted her chin, meeting his concerned stare. A bitter smile played at her lips. “Of course I am, but… I just can’t go through with it.”
Jim’s confusion deepened. “Why not?”
Sadie exhaled heavily.
If Noah discovered the truth about Averi, everything would spiral out of control.noveldrama
Three years ago, he had abandoned both her and the child she carried without a second thought. Why would he suddenly change now?
She couldn’t take that risk—it wasn’t an option.
“There are things that are too complicated to explain right now,” she murmured, her tone distant as she avoided Jim’s gaze.
Jim studied her hesitation, a thought forming in his mind.
Sadie, sensing his scrutiny, became even more unsettled.
“Dr. Archer, I appreciate your concern for Averi. I’ll do my best to find a suitable bone marrow donor as soon as possible.” With that, she turned and walked toward Averi.
Jim watched her retreating figure, emotions churning inside him. He had wanted to say more, to convince her, but the words wouldn’t come.
With a heavy heart, he turned and left the hospital room.
Sadie was always like this—fragile yet incredibly strong-willed.
And for some reason, that only made him want to help her even more. 
.

###Chapter 217:
Back in his office, Jim picked up the phone and called a colleague, William Carter.noveldrama
The line connected, and a familiar voice answered amid the background noise of machinery and muffled conversation.
“Hello? William, it’s Jim.”
“Jim? What’s going on?” William’s voice carried a note of exhaustion.
“I have a young patient in critical condition. We need a bone marrow donor immediately,” Jim said, getting straight to the point.
“There’s a long list of urgent cases ahead of you,” William responded. Jim recognized the challenge William faced, but Averi couldn’t afford any delays.
“This kid has acute lymphoblastic leukemia. His health is deteriorating fast. We’re running out of time,” Jim said.
A brief silence followed. William seemed to be considering his options. “Alright, send me his details. I’ll see if I can move him up the list, but you know my hands are tied to some extent.”
“I really appreciate it, William. Thank you.”
At the Wall Group headquarters, Noah stood by the towering window, a cigarette resting between his fingers, its ember glowing and fading with each breath.
“Mr. Wall, Miss Wade has instructed the legal team to proceed with the case against Miss Hudson’s studio. The paperwork is already in motion,” Samuel reported as he stepped into the office, breaking the silence.
He studied Noah’s face carefully.
Noah turned sharply, his hand pausing midair. Ash crumbled onto the carpet.
Sadie’s stubborn yet fragile expression flashed through his mind, stirring an inexplicable irritation.
The rhythmic sound of heels clicking against the floor echoed as Kyla entered, carrying an insulated food jar and a gentle smile.
é tя? ín Galπoνεl?.c
“Noah, I made you some soup. Have it while it’s still hot,” she said softly, setting the container on the desk.
Noah’s gaze settled on her.
Sensing a subtle shift in his expression, Kyla felt a flicker of unease but quickly concealed it.
“What’s this lawsuit about?” Noah’s voice was calm, but there was an underlying edge to it.
Kyla’s fingers tensed. “I was just following company protocol. I wanted to help Sadie, but there have been ongoing issues with Timeless Love. She refused to make the requested changes, and the design team…” Her words trailed off, growing quieter, laced with hesitation.
But Noah had already stopped listening. He stubbed out his cigarette, grabbed his coat, and walked toward the door.
“Drop the case against Sadie’s studio,” he ordered.
Samuel hesitated briefly before nodding. “Understood, Mr. Wall.”
Without another word, Noah left, leaving Kyla standing alone, her face turning pale.
She couldn’t comprehend why Noah would go to such lengths for Sadie.
Everything she had orchestrated was unraveling before her eyes.
She clutched the silk scarf in her hand, her nails pressing into her skin. Losing to Sadie was not an option. She had to win Noah’s heart.
Lost in his thoughts, Noah found himself at the hospital without even realizing how he got there.
Averi sat quietly on the bed, absentmindedly toying with a Transformer figure.
His wide eyes held a maturity beyond his years. 
.

###Chapter 218:
The door creaked open, and a tall figure stepped inside.
Noah’s arrival shattered the quiet of the room.
Dressed in a charcoal-gray suit, he exuded an air of authority. His striking features remained unreadable, a cold distance in his gaze.
Averi looked up, curiosity flickering in his round eyes as he studied the unfamiliar visitor.
Yet, there was something oddly familiar about him.
“Who are you?” Averi asked.noveldrama
Noah hesitated, momentarily caught off guard. He hadn’t expected the boy to be alone.
His eyes scanned the room, searching for Sadie.
When Noah didn’t respond, Averi spoke again. “Hello?”
Noah’s heart softened slightly at the sound of Averi’s voice.
He stepped closer to the bed, his gaze resting on the boy, a quiet softness in his expression.
Interacting with children wasn’t something Noah was accustomed to, and Averi’s pure, expectant eyes left him momentarily at a loss.
Noah hesitated, deliberating before saying, “I’m a friend of your mom’s. My name is Noah Wall.”
Averi blinked, momentarily puzzled, but accepted the reply without question. He lifted his Transformer figure and held it out to Noah. “Will you play with me?”
Silence settled over the room.
Noah studied the boy, emotions swirling beneath the surface. Slowly, he lowered himself to meet Averi at eye level. The child’s round face and clear, innocent gaze bore a striking resemblance to Sadie. Taking the toy from Averi’s hand, Noah let out a small breath. “Alright, let’s play.”

Down the hospital hallway, Pierre’s voice rang with disbelief and enthusiasm. “Miss Hudson, the Wall Group has dropped the lawsuit! The legal documents have been rescinded!”
Sadie paused, momentarily caught off guard. What was Noah up to? Was this some sort of strategic maneuver? This wasn’t like him.
“I see,” she responded evenly, though turmoil brewed beneath her composed tone. “Set up a meeting with the CEO of Lawrence Group for tomorrow afternoon.”
Pierre acknowledged the request before taking his leave.
Sadie turned and headed toward Averi’s room.
As she approached the door, her steps softened. She hesitated, peering through the narrow opening. Noah? What was he doing here?
An inexplicable tightness gripped her chest, her heartbeat quickening. Without thinking, she pushed the door open. Then, she froze.
Inside, Noah was crouching on the floor, fully engaged in a game with Averi. The usual iciness in his demeanor had been replaced by something almost… tender.
Averi’s laughter filled the room, his dimpled cheeks glowing with delight.
Holding up Optimus Prime, he called out excitedly, “Dad, look! The Autobot has transformed!”
The sudden call of “Dad” left both Sadie and Noah stunned.
A sharp pang shot through Sadie’s chest, as if something had constricted around her heart. She hadn’t anticipated this. Could it mean…?
Noah, equally shocked, remained still.
His intense gaze flickered between the child and the woman standing in the doorway, his lips pressing into a firm line.

###Chapter 219:
Sadie fought to keep her emotions in check. Forcing a smile, she asked, “Averi, what are you playing with?”
The moment he saw her, Averi abandoned his toy and ran straight into her arms. “Mom!”
He turned to glance at Noah, curiosity in his wide eyes. “Mom, this—”noveldrama
Before he could finish, Sadie gently covered his mouth, stopping him mid-sentence.
Averi blinked up at her, confusion evident, his tiny hands attempting to pull hers away. “Averi, he’s not your dad.”
The little boy hesitated, clearly wanting to say more, but one look at Sadie’s firm expression made him fall silent. Still, his gaze kept drifting back toward Noah.
Noah remained crouching, his sharp eyes locked onto Sadie as if searching for an answer in her expression.
Suppressing the chaos of emotions within her, Sadie straightened and spoke, her voice measured. “Mr. Wall, we need to talk. Outside.”
She refused to let this conversation unfold in front of the child. Averi didn’t need to witness the tension brewing between them.
Noah stood, his towering presence casting a long shadow across the room. Without a word, he followed her out.
The moment the door shut behind them, Sadie’s carefully constructed composure crumbled.
“Noah, what exactly do you think you’re doing?”
The warmth Sadie had shown moments ago had vanished, replaced once again by cold detachment.
Noah’s brows knitted together in confusion. “Why did Averi call me Dad?” he asked, his voice tinged with concern.

Sadie paused, then responded with a mocking laugh. “Mr. Wall, you know children. They say whatever comes to mind. Why overthink it? Or is this just another one of your games?”
Noah’s expression grew somber, but he maintained his calm. “Sadie, I’m asking for the truth,” he said firmly.
“The truth?” Sadie’s voice was laced with derision. “What truth could you possibly want from me, Mr. Wall? Remember, we’re divorced. Affairs have nothing to do with you anymore.”
As Sadie turned to walk away, Noah reached out, his grasp firm on her wrist. “Sadie, don’t push me,” he said quietly, his voice carrying a dangerous edge.
Sadie jerked her arm away, her eyes flashing. “Please, Mr. Wall, keep your hands to yourself.”
She didn’t look back as she walked into the hospital room, where Averi was playing with his toys cheerfully. He looked up and smiled brightly at her return.
Noah lingered in the deserted corridor, a tumult of emotions churning behind his intense gaze. He took out his phone and made a call. “I need to know what’s happening with Averi.”
The response came swiftly, carrying grave news. “Mr. Wall, Averi has been diagnosed with leukemia and urgently requires a bone marrow transplant. The most likely match would be his biological father…”
Noah clenched his jaw, a flicker of concern crossing his face as he thought of Alex. What was Alex thinking?
The following day, Sadie was the epitome of professionalism in her beige suit, her demeanor calm and poised. Her ride pulled up in front of the towering Lawrence Group building, and she stepped out gracefully.
“Miss Hudson, it’s been a while,” greeted Hank’s secretary, who was waiting for her at the entrance. His smile was warm and welcoming. Sadie returned the gesture, her expression calm yet cordial. “Hello.”

###Chapter 220:
The secretary ushered her into Hank’s office, a spacious room bathed in natural light from the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows.
As Sadie approached, Hank turned with a welcoming smile. “Miss Hudson, please take a seat,” he offered, gesturing towards a plush chair.
Sadie settled into the chair, and Hank promptly served her a cup of coffee. “My wife absolutely adores the jewelry set you designed last time. She’s constantly praising how unique the design is,” he shared, his tone conveying genuine appreciation.
“Thank you,” Sadie replied, her smile softening. “It’s always wonderful to hear such positive feedback, especially from Mrs. Lawrence.”
Hank’s expression grew thoughtful. “I’ve heard about the challenges your studio has faced recently. I’m very sorry to hear that.”noveldrama
He paused, then reached into his desk drawer and produced a gold-embossed invitation, which he extended towards Sadie. “We’re celebrating our tenth wedding anniversary in ten days with a small gathering. I’d be honored if you could join us.”
Taking the invitation, Sadie felt a surge of hope. This was more than just an invitation; it was a lifeline. Her studio needed a platform to restore its reputation, and Hank’s event could provide just that.
Sadie met Hank’s gaze confidently, her voice calm and clear. “Mr. Lawrence, I’m honored to accept your invitation to the anniversary celebration. I will ensure the ‘Ten Year Promise’ jewelry set is completed to the highest standard. I sincerely hope it will meet Mrs. Lawrence’s expectations.”
Hank looked back at her, a flicker of respect in his eyes.
Sadie knew this event was an opportunity she couldn’t afford to let slip away.
After leaving the Lawrence Group, she stepped into the lively street, her thoughts whirling with plans and possibilities.
She quickly pulled out her phone to call her assistant, Pierre.

“Hey, Pierre, it’s me,” Sadie said as soon as he picked up.
“Sadie! How did everything go? What did Mr. Lawrence say?” Pierre’s voice buzzed with curiosity and excitement.
“He invited me to his 10th wedding anniversary party,” Sadie responded with a subtle note of triumph.
“That’s incredible, Sadie! I knew it would go well!” Pierre’s enthusiasm was palpable, lifting Sadie’s spirits even higher.
Sadie allowed herself a brief smile of satisfaction, but her expression quickly shifted back to one of focus. “We can’t celebrate just yet. The ‘Ten Year Promise’ collection requires very specific gemstones, with the centerpiece being a Cardilla Pink Diamond. They’re scarce in the market, but we need to find one.”
“These diamonds are rare in the country, so we need to airlift one from abroad immediately.” Sadie’s fingers danced across her phone screen as she spoke, visualizing the radiant pink diamond in her design sketches. “Got it, Sadie. I’ll contact our international suppliers immediately,” Pierre assured her.
“Ensure the quality of the gemstones is up to standard. We have some flexibility with the price, but we need to keep it within our budget,” Sadie instructed, her tone firm.
“Understood!” Pierre replied.
After ending the call, Sadie quickly caught a taxi and headed to the hospital.
Half an hour later, Sadie was sitting by Averi’s bed in the hospital room. He lay quietly, holding the picture book she had brought him. His small face looked pale and delicate under the soft light.
Sadie’s heart tightened with concern. Suddenly, she heard an anxious voice behind her. “Sadie!”
Turning, Sadie saw Jim hurrying toward her, his expression a mix of urgency and excitement. Confusion washed over Sadie.
“Dr. Archer, what’s happened?” Sadie asked. 
.

###Chapter 221:
Jim’s face broke into a smile as he reached her. “Sadie, it’s good news! We’ve found a bone marrow match for Averi!”
For a moment, Sadie was stunned, the words not quite sinking in. A match meant a chance for Averi’s recovery, an opportunity for life. “Really? Are you certain?” Sadie asked, her voice a mixture of hope and disbelief.
Jim nodded emphatically. “Absolutely sure. It’s a perfect match. We can start planning the surgery very soon.”
“Kyla, I owe you so much. Without your help, I never would have secured the position at Alice Design Studio,” Jordyn said, her voice laced with sincere appreciation and a hint of flattery.
Kyla, feeling somewhat impatient, was poised to dismiss her with brief acknowledgments before ending the call.
As Jordyn shared news of her new role, she only offered a nonchalant “Mm” in response.
“Today is my first day, Kyla. There was someone in the department who took leave to donate bone marrow…” Jordyn sounded unsure, as if she was pondering whether to say more.
“Bone marrow donation? It’s really no big deal,” Kyla commented dismissively.
“But… Kyla, I happened to see the name of the person receiving the donation…” Jordyn lowered her voice, adding a layer of intrigue.
“And that name was?” Kyla felt a jolt of apprehension.
“It’s… Averi Hudson.”
“Averi?” Kyla sat bolt upright.
What were the odds? The world seemed too small at that moment.
Kyla pondered how Sadie seemed to be continually favored by fortune. As Kyla struggled to maintain her composure, her voice softened. “Jordyn, are you certain? Was it Sadie’s son, Averi?”

“Absolutely, Kyla. I saw it myself! The file for the donor clearly listed Averi Hudson as the recipient, diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia…”
Kyla nervously bit her bottom lip.
She recognized a rare chance she had to seize.
If the boy were to pass away, even if Noah later discovered the truth about the child’s parentage, it would be irrelevant.
Her position would remain secure.
“Well done, Jordyn. Set up a meeting with your colleague for me.”
“Right away, Kyla!” Jordyn responded, her voice filled with passion.
With a satisfied grin, Kyla hung up.noveldrama
At the hospital, the potent scent of disinfectant pervaded the halls.
Sadie’s grip on Averi’s small hand was firm, her fingers chillingly cold.
Wearing an oversized hospital gown, Averi looked wan but offered Sadie a reassuring smile, his dimples showing.
“Mom, I’m not scared!”
Sadie leaned in and kissed his forehead tenderly, whispering, “I know. You’re the bravest, my Averi.”
Since a donor match had been found, a persistent unease gnawed at Sadie, a premonition that trouble was brewing.
The medical team from Maradeiris had arrived, and Jim had gone over the surgical details more than once. Everything appeared to be on track. As a nurse took Averi’s blood samples, Sadie stayed close, her watchful eyes fixed on him, not looking away even for a moment.

###Chapter 222:
Suddenly, Jim hurried toward her, his face marked by urgency.
“Sadie, there’s a complication. There’s something you need to hear.”noveldrama
Dread filled Sadie’s heart. “What’s happened, Dr. Archer?”
Jim paused, evidently searching for the right way to break the news. “The donor… has backed out.”
“They what?” Disbelief clouded Sadie’s face as her voice climbed in pitch.
Her ears began to ring, and her surroundings seemed to blur.
Why now?
They had been so close to moving forward. What made the donor reconsider at the last minute?
Sadie’s face lost all color, her lips quivering, but she found herself speechless.
Averi, sensing her unease, looked up with concern. “What’s wrong, Mommy?”
Holding back tears, Sadie smiled weakly. “Oh, it’s just a little hiccup, honey. Mommy will fix it.”
She led Jim out into the hallway to speak privately, away from Averi’s prying ears.
“Sadie, I assure you, we’re scrambling to find another donor,” Jim said, trying to soothe her.
Sadie was desperate and asked, “Could I possibly contact the donor myself? Maybe I could change their mind. We don’t have much time.”
Jim’s face showed sympathy, but he hesitated. “I’m truly sorry, Sadie. I can’t reveal that information. It’s against our policy.”
Feeling her legs weaken, Sadie nearly stumbled.
She expressed her gratitude to Jim, holding onto her composure.
Feel inspired by gα ?η σ ν s, com
After steadying herself, she returned to Averi’s room.
“Mommy, you look sad,” Averi said, his voice full of worry.
Forcing another smile, Sadie stroked his hair tenderly. “I’m just a bit worn out, my love. Don’t worry.”
Darkness had enveloped the city, and Averi’s fever had spiked once more. His cheeks radiated a feverish glow, while his small hands gripped Sadie’s shirt tightly.
“Mom… Pizza…”
Each word from Averi tugged at Sadie’s heartstrings, filling her with a turbulent mix of worry and fear that clouded her thoughts. She caressed Averi’s hot forehead gently, her voice a calm whisper.
“Hang in there, Averi. Mommy’s going to get it for you right now.”
Near the hospital was a pizzeria, and Sadie made her way there swiftly. She bought Averi’s favorite pizza and hurried back, moving quickly and with purpose.
As she rounded a corner by the hospital’s back garden, she overheard a conversation.
Kyla and Jordyn were talking nearby.
Sadie instinctively took cover behind a tree blooming with fragrant flowers.
“That’s a brilliant plan, Kyla! Sadie’s child won’t last much longer,” Jordyn remarked, her voice dripping with vile satisfaction.
Kyla responded sharply, “Enough! Just take the money and keep quiet.”
Peering through the tree’s leaves, Sadie watched as Kyla handed over a thick envelope of cash to Jordyn.
A gleeful smile spread across Jordyn’s face as she took the envelope, nodding repeatedly. “You can trust me, Kyla. I won’t say a word.”
Sadie pressed her hand to her mouth, muffling any inadvertent noises. A cold shiver ran through her as she realized the gravity of their conversation. She knew she had to get to the bottom of it.

###Chapter 223:
Sadie turned around and slipped away silently from the area. Jordyn, unbeknownst to Sadie, shifted her eyes toward the very place Sadie had vacated moments before.
Finding herself in a quiet corner, Sadie retrieved her phone and made a call to a private detective. “Hello, Leif. I need your help to follow someone…”
Returning to the hospital room, Sadie entered with the pizza, its delicious scent filling the air.
Curled up on the hospital bed, Averi’s small frame struggled under the weight of his fever, which left him both groggy and weak.
Maintaining her composure, Sadie brought a slice of pizza to Averi’s lips. “It’s pizza time, Averi,” she said, encouraging him to eat. After managing a few bites, Averi drifted back into a feverish slumber.
At that moment, a buzz from Sadie’s phone broke the silence.
Opening it, she saw a message from the detective, Leif Perez.
“The woman Jordyn met after leaving the hospital is named Kairi Torres, who works at Alice Design Studio. Jordyn has just been made the design director there. Interestingly, Kairi was also Averi’s donor.”
As she read the message, Sadie’s hand clenched around her phone, her veins pronounced against her skin.
She wasted no time calling Leif back. “I need to see Kairi Torres as soon as you can arrange it.”noveldrama
Leif’s voice wavered slightly as he replied, “Miss Hudson, I must warn you…”
“This is about my son’s life. It won’t be easy, but I have to know more. I’ll double your fee.”
After a pause, Leif replied decisively, “I understand. Meet her tomorrow at ten at Starbucks, on the second floor by the window.”
Ending the call, Sadie massaged her eyes, raw from lack of sleep.
L?tτ cнαρτ?rs ιn glov?l?.
She spent the night awake, restless with worry.
By dawn, Averi’s fever had finally subsided.
Once the caregiver arrived, Sadie gave her detailed instructions before she departed from the hospital.
Dressed in a beige trench coat that reflected her somber mood, her long hair flowing freely, Sadie looked every bit the part of a woman on a mission.
She arrived early at Starbucks, securing the specified spot, her heart racing with nervous anticipation.
She would give up everything for Averi, without a second thought.
A woman dressed in a sleek black business suit entered the shop. She was Kairi.
Though her makeup was flawless, it barely concealed the weariness in her eyes.
Taking a seat opposite Sadie, Kairi wasted no time. “Miss Hudson, I’m aware of who you are.”
A slight nod came from Sadie, her hands clammy with nervous sweat. “Likewise, I know you as well, Miss Torres.”
A flicker of emotion crossed Kairi’s eyes as she chuckled bitterly. “I sympathize with your situation, Miss Hudson, but I was offered a substantial amount, and I need the money.”
With almost desperate urgency, Sadie responded, “I’m prepared to offer you double that amount.”
Kairi, caught off guard by Sadie’s straightforward approach, briefly let excitement flash in her eyes before regaining her composure. “I’ll accept that, but under one condition.”
“What’s the condition?” Sadie asked immediately. “If it’s reasonable, I’ll agree.”
“No one can know about this, especially… Kyla.”
Pausing briefly, Sadie nodded in understanding. “You have my word.” She understood Kairi’s concerns. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 224:
If Kyla found out about Kairi’s change of heart, the consequences could be disastrous.
Such a revelation could even threaten the success of Averi’s impending surgery.
When Kairi saw Sadie’s nod of agreement, her shoulders, previously knotted with tension, relaxed slightly.
With a gentle clasp, she lifted her coffee cup, allowing herself a cautious sip. The unexpected success of her plan brought a faint, pleased smile to her lips.
Jordyn had been right—there was indeed more money to be made, and it was now within their grasp.
After setting a date for the surgery, they parted ways, each wrapped in their own thoughts.
Back at the hospital, Sadie sought out Jim.
Finding him in his office, she didn’t hesitate. “Dr. Archer, we’re ready to proceed with the surgery,” she announced with firmness.
Jim, adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses, met her certainty with a contemplative look. “Are you sure about this? The donor…”
“Yes, I’m certain,” Sadie cut in, her tone leaving no room for doubt. “Everything’s arranged.”
Standing, she straightened her elegant coat and exited with a decisive turn, leaving Jim to ponder.
On the day of the surgery, Sadie found herself on a bench outside the operating room, her eyes fixed on the silent doors.
Time seemed to crawl, each tick of the clock stretching longer than the last.
The agreed time had slipped by, and yet there was no sign of Kairi.noveldrama
g ? ln σ ν s?com, home to the best fiction
A knot of unease began to form in Sadie’s stomach.
Suddenly, the side door swung open. It wasn’t Kairi who emerged, but Jordyn, her appearance a sharp contrast in the sterile hallway with her bright red ensemble and vividly painted lips. Her smile was anything but warm; it was a chilling curl of disdain.
“Sadie, you made the wrong move,” Jordyn declared ominously.
Sadie sprang to her feet, her eyes wide with panic, as if she had sensed the bad news before it was even broken.
“Where is Kairi?” Her voice cracked with urgency.
“Kairi?” Jordyn’s laughter rang out, sharp and mocking, as though she had just heard the punchline of a cruel joke. “I knew you’d come looking for her. There was no way I’d ever let her show up. Right now, she’s probably boarding a plane to some far-off place.”
Jordyn stepped closer, towering over Sadie with a menacing grin. “I knew someone was tailing me. I dangled Kairi like bait, and, predictably, you snapped it up. Sadie, you’re still as clueless as ever.”
A loud buzz filled Sadie’s ears, her mind spiraling into a whirlwind of shock and disbelief.
She stumbled back, her hand scrabbling on the wall to find something—anything—to steady herself.
“Sadie, you might want to start planning your son’s funeral,” Jordyn sneered, her voice dripping with venom.
She turned sharply, her high heels clicking decisively against the floor as she walked away, leaving a stunned Sadie to grapple with the darkness encroaching on the edges of her vision.
Kairi was gone. Without her, what would become of Averi?
Sadie’s heart thudded painfully in her chest. She couldn’t afford to lose him now!
Averi was teetering on the brink; time was running out. Desperation clawed at her. Was Noah the only one she could turn to? Would he even agree to help, after everything that had happened?

###Chapter 225:
Despair clung to her with a crushing intensity, its grip as tight and suffocating as a shroud.
Her complexion turned ghostly pale, every hint of color washed away by the tidal wave of her anguish.
Her heart ached, feeling as though it were being shredded piece by piece.
The cruel twists of fate seemed unending—why were she and Averi subjected to such relentless suffering?
With her parents gone and her divorce, now she faced the terrifying possibility of losing Averi too.
Biting down hard on her lower lip, she fought to hold back the tears brimming in her eyes.
At that moment, the doors to the operating room creaked open. Jim strode out, peeling off his surgical mask with a grave expression etched on his face.
He spotted Sadie instantly, a solitary figure slumped against the wall, her form barely holding up against the weight of her misery. A jolt of concern pierced him as he quickened his steps toward her, his hands reaching out to offer support.
“Sadie,” he called softly, his voice tinged with worry. His fingers brushed against her icy skin, sending a ripple of unease through him. He had intended to inquire about the donor’s arrival, but the sight of her, so visibly shattered, halted his words.
Sadie’s gaze was distant and unfocused, the light in her eyes dimmed by pain.
The hollow, haunted look in her eyes sank Jim’s heart further, a heavy dread coiling in his stomach. Gently, he guided her to sit on the nearby bench.
Her voice, when she spoke, was a fragile whisper, raw and broken. “Dr. Archer… Averi…”
Jim’s gaze locked onto her, his stomach twisting into a tight knot as the full weight of her fears sank in.
With urgency quickening his steps, he hurried back to the operating room to manage the crucial follow-up procedures.

Moments later, the sterile light of the operating room flicked off, and the doors creaked open slowly.
Jim emerged, his expression etched with gravity, clutching a report marked “Critical Condition.”
Meanwhile, Averi was wheeled out by a nurse, his small frame appearing hauntingly pale on the bed, his breaths so shallow they were barely noticeable.noveldrama
“Averi…”
Sadie’s voice broke as she extended trembling hands toward her son. She yearned to caress him but hesitated, her fingers suspended in mid-air before they fell limply at her sides.
Jim observed her turmoil, his own heart heavy. After a moment’s pause, he extended the report toward her.
Sadie didn’t accept it; her gaze remained transfixed on Averi, her eyes hollow with despair.
Later, in the solitude of Averi’s hospital room, Sadie sat unmoving beside his bed, her face a mask of numbness.
A shaky hand reached into her pocket, pulling out her phone. Her eyes lingered on “Noah Wall” in her contact list, her thoughts tangled in indecision.
She despised the idea of begging, of reopening old wounds with him.
Yet, for Averi’s sake, she felt cornered into a decision she loathed. Her finger trembled as she hit the dial button, each ring echoing like a drumbeat against her chest, amplifying her dread.
Doubts swirled in her mind—what if Noah refused to help? The thought was unbearable. 
.
.

###Chapter 226:
With a deep breath, she squeezed her eyes shut, her heart pleading for a miracle.
The phone continued to ring, each second stretching into an eternity.
Just as despair was about to claim her, the line connected. “Hello?”
“Hello?” On the other end of the line came a gentle yet distant female voice.
Sadie’s grip on the phone tightened instinctively.
It was Kyla.
The hospital room was silent apart from Averi’s soft breaths and the steady beeps of the medical monitors. Why was Kyla on the line instead of Noah?
With rising anxiety suppressed within her, Sadie managed a steady tone. “Where’s Noah?”
“He’s had too much to drink. He’s not in a state to talk right now.” Kyla’s voice was soothing, apologetic, yet carried an undertone of satisfaction.
A heavy feeling settled in Sadie’s stomach.
Drunk?
Memories of Noah’s indifference toward her, contrasting with his affection for Kyla, filled her with a painful bitterness.
Naturally. Noah and Kyla were set to marry. It was logical for them to be together.
A rueful smile crossed Sadie’s lips.
Why should she expect anything different?
The soft hospital lighting threw her weary features into stark relief, accentuating her fatigue.
She bit her lip with such force she nearly drew blood.
For Averi’s sake, she had no choice but to swallow her dignity.

“Kyla, what is it that you want?”
After a pause, Kyla’s voice returned, softer yet puzzled. “What do you mean? I just picked up the phone. Why are you speaking to me this way?”
Sadie shut her eyes tightly.
The false innocence in Kyla’s voice was revolting to her.
She was aware that Kyla was deliberately taunting her, basking in her own triumph.
Opening her eyes, Sadie retorted, “Enough with the act. I’m well aware of who you are. You’ve secured your place beside Noah. And about Kairi, aren’t you worried about karma?”
Kyla’s laughter was light, mocking, as if Sadie’s words were a joke. “Karma? Sadie, such naivety. Do you actually believe in divine justice? Strength rules, that’s the only law. You left the country once; you should have stayed away. What brought you back?”
Sadie’s hands balled into fists.
She had to bear this for Averi’s sake.
“I’m pleading with you. Save Averi, and I’ll do whatever you ask. I’ll leave this instant and disappear forever.” Her voice was strained, laden with despair.
After a brief pause, Kyla responded, amusement in her tone, “Disappear forever? Show me you mean it, Sadie.”
Sadie’s heart was in her throat.noveldrama
But before she could respond, Kyla hung up abruptly, deleting the call log right after.
“What are you doing?” A deep male voice suddenly broke the silence, startling Kyla so much that she nearly knocked over the glass on the table.
She turned quickly to see Noah standing at the staircase.
He was dressed in casual loungewear, the collar of his shirt slightly open, revealing his seductive collarbones.
His handsome face was unreadable, giving nothing away.

###Chapter 227:
Kyla suppressed the panic rising in her chest and hurried over to him, slipping her arm around his. “Your phone fell on the floor earlier. I just picked it up for you.”
Today, Isabel had invited them over for dinner.
It had taken all of Kyla’s effort to convince Noah to agree.
Earlier, Isabel had pulled Noah upstairs to talk, leaving his phone downstairs, which was how Kyla received Sadie’s call.
Noah said nothing, merely giving her a brief glance before picking up his phone and walking out.
Kyla felt a wave of relief, yet a lingering sense of unease remained.
“Noah, dinner is ready. Why don’t you stay and have dinner with your mother before you go?” She took a few steps after him.
But Noah didn’t stop. He didn’t even look back, leaving without a word.
Kyla stood frozen in place, the smile on her face slowly fading.
Her hands balled into fists, her nails digging into her palms.
It was fine, she reassured herself. Once Sadie was completely out of the picture, Noah would eventually be hers. Sadie must be frantic now, like a cat on a hot tin roof.
The thought brought a cold smile to Kyla’s lips once more.
She would make sure Sadie understood—Sadie could never win against her.
A sharp sound of porcelain shattering came from upstairs, piercing through the air.
Kyla’s heart skipped a beat, a sense of foreboding washing over her.
She hurried upstairs, gently pushing open the slightly ajar door.
Inside, Isabel sat by the bed, her face ashen.
Exclusive stories gαlnσν?ls?com
Kyla approached cautiously, her voice filled with concern. “Isabel, are you alright? What happened?”
Isabel suddenly looked up, her eyes red with anger. “Noah’s defying me again, all for that wretched woman!”
Isabel’s well-maintained face was now twisted with pain and fury.
Kyla’s heart leapt with joy, but she put on a worried face as she gently held Isabel’s shoulders and softly comforted her. “Please don’t be upset. It’s not worth it to harm your health over this. Noah must have been momentarily blinded—”
“Blinded? He’s completely bewitched by that woman!” Isabel shook Kyla’s hands away, her tone sharp.
Kyla lowered her gaze. She gently patted Isabel’s back as she said, “Please calm down. Maybe Noah is just acting on impulse. Once he cools down, he’ll understand your good intentions.”
She paused for a moment, then added, “You’re the closest person to him after all.”noveldrama
Isabel’s anger gradually subsided. She reached out and took Kyla’s hands. “Kyla, you’re so understanding, unlike that cursed woman, Sadie, who’s always trying to drive a wedge between me and my son!”
Noah strode out of the villa with a determined pace. Samuel, who had been lingering by the door, quickly followed. He opened his mouth to speak several times, each attempt faltering before words could form.
Finally, gathering his courage, he managed to break the silence. “Mr. Wall…”
Noah paused, turning slightly, his intense gaze sharp with impatience. “Yes, what is it?”
Gathering himself, Samuel continued, “There’s been a report from the person watching Miss Hudson. He reported… he reported that Averi is facing some complications.”
“What kind of complications?” Noah’s voice was stern, demanding clarity.
Samuel shifted uneasily, his eyes darting away as he stuttered, “It’s… the donor, sir… They’ve decided to back out.” 
.

###Chapter 228:
Noah stopped dead in his tracks, clearly shaken by the news. He wasn’t Averi’s father, but the thought of the boy in jeopardy tightened his chest with visceral pain as if his heart was being squeezed. A deep frustration surged through him. He closed his eyes for a moment, battling to maintain his composure. Gritting his teeth, he whispered, “Sadie… Averi…”
Noah then snapped his eyes open, his resolve hardening. Turning to Samuel, he commanded, “Get the car ready. We’re heading to the hospital immediately.”
Samuel didn’t hesitate. “Understood, Mr. Wall,” he responded swiftly before hurrying to the car.
Noah turned on his heel and strode toward the black Maybach parked by the roadside. Without another word, he got in, and they sped off toward the hospital.
Inside the hospital room, the atmosphere was heavy with exhaustion. Sadie sat by Averi’s bed, her body slumped forward in restless sleep. The faint beeping of the monitors was the only sound filling the silence.
Noah’s entrance disrupted the deep silence enveloping the room. His imposing presence filled the doorway, Samuel following closely like a faithful shadow.
Jim, already in the room, glanced up from the sofa. His eyes briefly met Noah’s, and there was a fleeting flicker of something—something like distance or perhaps regret. The friendship they once shared had long since eroded, replaced by a quiet, tense estrangement.
Noah’s voice cut through the tension, calm yet carrying an underlying urgency. “How is the boy now?”noveldrama
He stepped closer to the bed, his eyes fixed on Averi’s pale, delicate features. An unexpected tightness gripped his chest as he looked down at the boy.
Jim’s gaze flickered with fury and helplessness as he looked at Noah.
The impulse to knock him out and force him to undergo the procedure himself, to get the bone marrow by any means necessary, was almost too much to bear. But Jim held himself back, his jaw clenched tight in restraint.

“The donor…” Jim’s voice faltered as he struggled to contain his anger. “She took the money from Sadie and fled the country.”
Noah’s head snapped up, his sharp, cold gaze locking onto Jim. “What did you say?”
Jim’s voice dropped into a grim tone. “Averi’s condition… isn’t looking good. We’re running out of time.”
Noah’s eyes drifted over to Sadie, who was resting, her face pale and etched with exhaustion. His expression hardened. Without a word, he turned on his heel and stormed out of the room.
Samuel quickly followed, his steps hurried. “Mr. Wall, where are we going?”
Noah’s pace didn’t falter as he spoke. “Find that donor. Every lead, every scrap of information, now.”
Samuel didn’t waste a second, pulling out his phone to start making calls. He was used to Noah’s urgency, but this felt different. This time, there was no room for failure.
Jim lingered in the doorway, watching Noah leave. His emotions were a twisted knot in his chest. Perhaps, with Noah’s involvement, they could finally make some progress in this desperate situation.
Jim left the room, closing the door gently behind him.
The soft click of the door shutting was enough to stir Sadie from her sleep. Her eyelids fluttered open. She was groggy and disoriented. The room was empty, and the sterile scent of disinfectant hung in the air, mingling with the moment’s heaviness.
Sadie slowly sat up, her neck stiff and sore. She rubbed it absentmindedly as she struggled to steady herself, gripping the side of the bed to keep from toppling over.
Her eyes now flashed with a fire of determination.
For Averi, Sadie would do whatever it took. She would give up everything—her pride, her peace, even her sanity—if it meant he could survive. Sadie lingered at Averi’s bedside, her hand gently brushing his soft cheek.

###Chapter 229:
“Mommy will make sure you get better,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.
Sadie knew Kyla’s motive well; Kyla wanted to remove her from Noah’s life, and nothing would stop her. Then, she would just leave. Nothing mattered more than Averi’s life.
Sadie picked up her phone, her hand steady despite the gravity of the situation. She dialed Kyla’s number, her heart pounding as the call rang through.
The line connected, and Kyla’s smug voice came through, dripping with satisfaction. “Sadie, have you finally come to your senses?”
Sadie’s voice remained calm, her tone betraying no emotion. “I want to talk to you.”
Kyla’s laughter echoed on the other end. “Fine. Tomorrow morning, I’ll meet you at the cafe beside the hospital,” she said before abruptly hanging up.noveldrama
Sadie put the phone down with a quiet exhale, her gaze returning to Averi. The weight of her decision settled heavily on her chest, but there was no turning back. For Averi, she would endure anything.
The following morning, Sadie stood before the mirror, adjusting her coat and gathering her thoughts. With a final glance at Averi, she opened the door to the hospital room and stepped into the corridor. The corridor was eerily silent, the faint click of her heels echoing as she made her way toward the elevator.
As the elevator descended, an unexpected calm washed over Sadie. She had prepared herself for what was to come, ready to face whatever Kyla threw her way.
The cafe smelled of fresh coffee and pastries, but Sadie barely noticed. She sat by the window, lost in thought as she waited for Kyla to arrive. Kyla arrived late, walking into the cafe like she owned it. Her black business suit was impeccably tailored, and her makeup flawless. She carried a Hermes Birkin bag in her hand, symbolizing her wealth. She approached Sadie with an air of superiority and sat across from her.
“So, what’s your decision?” she asked.
Sadie met Kyla’s gaze, her expression unflinching. “I’ll leave Noah. Forever.”

Kyla arched an eyebrow, a hint of disbelief flashing across her face. “Forever?” she repeated, her tone laced with skepticism.
Sadie raised her eyes to meet Kyla’s intense gaze, her voice steady, yet laced with a finality that chilled the air. “I’m leaving for abroad and I won’t return. Noah already believes Averi isn’t his child, so you have no worries now.”
Kyla regarded Sadie intently, her eyes narrowing as she tried to decipher the truth in her words.
There was a tense silence before Kyla’s lips curled into a small smile. “So, you’ve finally seen reason. You should have done this a long time ago.”
Sadie lowered her eyes.
“Keep in mind what you’ve promised.” Kyla took a sip of her coffee, leaving a vivid crimson mark on the cup’s edge.
Sadie remained silent, her features masked in stoicism as she observed Kyla, her thoughts veiled.
After what seemed like an eternity, Sadie gave a slight nod and stood to leave, her movements stiff with resolve.
Just as she walked out the door, a warm, familiar voice pierced the tension.
“Sadie!”
Sadie’s body locked in place as she lifted her gaze inch by inch.
Alex was standing nearby, his expression etched with deep concern. He hurried over, his gaze instantly drawn to Sadie’s slightly ashen complexion, the anxiety clear in his eyes.
“Hey, what’s going on? You don’t look so good,” Alex murmured, his voice laced with worry. He reached out, as if to gently caress her cheek, but hesitated, his hand hovering in the air.
Sidestepping his touch, Sadie mustered a weak smile and said, “I’m fine, really.”

###Chapter 230:
But Alex wasn’t fooled. He saw right through her brave facade, his concern only intensifying.
Sadie knew she couldn’t bear to add to his worries, so she deftly shifted the conversation. “What brings you here?”
“I was just passing by,” Alex replied, though his attention remained fixed on her. “How’s Averi? Did you run into someone?” His tone held a mixture of curiosity and unease.
Sadie averted her eyes, falling silent, the weight of unspoken words hanging between them.
Alex watched her closely, torn between pressing for answers and respecting her silence.
He sensed she was withholding something crucial, yet he chose not to pry.
After all, he had witnessed her encounter with Kyla, and the pieces were slowly coming together in his mind.
Sadie adjusted her coat with a sharp tug, turning on her heel to leave. Just then, Alex’s voice pierced the chilly air. “Sadie!” he called, desperation tinting his tone.
She paused mid-stride, her back to him, the tension in her posture palpable.
“No matter what happens, I’ll always be by your side.” His words hung heavy between them.
For a fleeting moment, Sadie’s resolve wavered, her shoulders tensing further under the weight of his promise.
She recognized his feelings all too well, but she couldn’t let herself feel the same.
Her mind was consumed with the safety of Averi; there was simply no room left for her own desires.
With silent resolve, she continued forward, her silhouette gradually fading as she vanished behind the corner.

Alex’s gaze lingered on her fading silhouette, emotions twisting inside him.
He took a deep breath to steady himself before pushing open the cafe’s glass door.
Inside, Kyla’s eyes sparkled with unspoken understanding as she caught sight of him. A sly smile played at the corners of her lips.
“Mr. Howe, what brings you here? Looking for Sadie?” she teased, her voice dripping with curiosity. “Unfortunately, she just left. Why do you care so much about Sadie?”
Alex sat across from her, his gaze sharp as he cut straight to the chase. “What did you say to her?” he demanded, his tone firm.
Kyla gently set down her coffee spoon, the metallic clink echoing sharply in the hushed atmosphere of the cafe.
She arched an eyebrow, her voice laced with a mix of amusement and challenge. “What’s this, Mr. Howe? Are you interrogating me now?”
Alex leaned forward, his brow creased with concern. “What exactly did you say to her to make her that upset?”
A light, almost mocking laugh escaped Kyla. “Oh, Mr. Howe, aren’t you the smart one? Can’t you see? I’m actually doing you a favor.”
Alex furrowed his brows even deeper, confusion and suspicion mingling in his eyes. “What do you mean by that?”
Kyla’s smirk widened. “You really think I’m oblivious to how you feel about Sadie?”
Alex’s face showed a fleeting mix of surprise and resignation that he didn’t bother to hide.
Kyla noted his reaction with a glint of triumph in her eyes. “All I’m doing is showing her how things really are—getting her to walk away from Noah. When she finally does, won’t that clear the path for you?”noveldrama
Alex’s grip on the table tightened, his knuckles whitening as a storm brewed within him.

###Chapter 231:
As he struggled to maintain composure, his voice dropped to a chilling whisper. “Kyla, watch your step. Sadie isn’t a chess piece in your little games.”noveldrama
Kyla’s eyes narrowed slightly, the edge in her voice sharp as a blade. “Is that a threat, Mr. Howe?”
Alex’s stare hardened, his tone resolute and menacing. “Consider it a warning. I don’t give a damn what you’re trying to do. You mess with Sadie again, and I’ll personally make your life a living hell.”
With a tense grunt, he stood, his imposing figure casting a long, ominous shadow over Kyla, his aura charged with a palpable, threatening energy.
Alex turned and walked out of the cafe with determination. Kyla watched him go, her eyebrows knitting together in frustration.
That Alex… He could be so dense!
In the hospital, Sadie waited until Averi’s IV drip was complete. After instructing the caregiver to keep an eye on Averi, she left the hospital.
It had been a while since she last visited Laura.
By the time she arrived at Laura’s apartment, night had fallen.
The air was scented with the inviting aroma of home-cooked food, and a soft, cheerful tune hummed from the kitchen where Laura was cooking. Her movements were fluid and practiced.
Since her surgery and the period of recovery that followed, Laura’s health had seen a significant improvement.
As Sadie entered, the warm and welcoming atmosphere enveloped her, stirring a mix of emotions.
“You’re back, Sadie. Why are you alone? Where are Averi and Alex?” Laura called from the kitchen, wearing a floral apron and holding a spatula.
“Alex took Averi out,” Sadie replied, forcing a smile and striving to sound casual.
g?lnσν?s?c?m fuels your imagination
Laura set a freshly prepared dish on the dining table and looked at Sadie with a perceptive gaze. “Sadie, are you keeping something from me?”
Sadie’s heart fluttered, and she averted her eyes to hide her inner turmoil. “Of course not, Grandma. What would I possibly hide from you?”
“You’ve never been good at keeping secrets.” Laura sighed, approaching Sadie and gently patting her hand. “I’m getting old, Sadie. All I want is to see you happy. Alex is a good man. You’re at the right age to settle down. Marrying Alex would really put my mind at ease.” Laura’s words touched a tender spot in Sadie’s heart.
Sadie fought back tears and managed a weak smile. “Grandma, what are you talking about? Alex and I… We’re not rushing anything.”
“Silly girl,” Laura said warmly, tousling Sadie’s hair.
“Alex treats you well. I can see it. He’s dependable and cares deeply for Averi and you. It’s rare to find someone who cherishes you so. Don’t let this opportunity pass by.”
Sadie felt a tightness in her throat as if a lump was lodged there, making it difficult to speak.
She couldn’t bring herself to tell Laura about Averi’s illness, fearing the news might be too overwhelming for her.
With clenched fists, Sadie pressed her nails into her palms, barely feeling the pain. She took a deep breath, trying to maintain her composure.
“I understand, Grandma. I’ll think about it carefully.”
Laura smiled, content, and ushered Sadie to the dining table.
“Come, let’s eat. I made your favorite—seasoned pork chops.” Sadie looked at the dishes spread out on the table but felt no hunger.
Mechanically, she began to eat, finding no taste in the food.
“Grandma…” Sadie eventually set down her utensils and called out softly, her voice quivering.

###Chapter 232:
Laura looked at her with affection. “What is it, dear?”
Gathering her courage, Sadie hesitated before asking tentatively, “Grandma, would you… would you be willing to come with me?”
“Come with you? Where to?” Laura asked, her brow furrowing in confusion.
Under the soft, warm light of the room, Sadie’s complexion appeared pale, her eyes reflecting fatigue.
She bit her lip, her eyes darting nervously. “To… to another country. To start fresh in a new environment,” she murmured hesitantly.
Laura paused, her fork hanging in midair, as she stared at Sadie, her face etched with surprise.
Sadie struggled to hold back tears, forcing a smile. In a voice half-pleading, she added, “Grandma, I want to start over somewhere new. Please come with me. Will you?”
Laura reached out and clasped Sadie’s hand, her rough palm warm and comforting. She sighed, her eyes soft and caring.
Knowing Sadie as a strong, independent woman who seldom asked for help since childhood, Laura gently squeezed her hand and spoke tenderly. “Sadie, I’m old now. I don’t…”
“Wish to move. But whatever you decide, I’ll support you. Just promise to take good care of yourself. That’s all I want.”
Tears escaped Sadie’s eyes, streaming down her cheeks.
She wrapped her arms around Laura, burying her face in her shoulder, and wept quietly.
Laura softly stroked her back, comforting her as one would soothe a child.
Guilt weighed heavily on Sadie’s heart.
After a long moment, she lifted her head and managed a weak smile.
“Grandma, I… I need to go now.”
“Alright, dear. Be careful out there,” Laura responded gently.
Sadie turned and walked slowly toward the door.noveldrama
At the threshold, she hesitated, not daring to look back. She feared that a glance might break her resolve to leave.
With a deep breath to steady herself, Sadie opened the door and stepped out into the cool night.
Sadie dashed down the stairs swiftly. The motion-sensor lights flickered on in sequence, illuminating her path before fading just as she passed.
Upon reaching the small flowerbed, Sadie sat on the chilly stone steps.
She hugged her knees tightly and hid her face in them.
Nearby, a sleek black Maybach stood silently by the roadside. Inside, Noah tapped his fingers on his thigh, a sign of his unease as he watched Sadie’s delicate form from afar. In a moment of frustration, he tugged at his tie.
“Mr. Wall, aren’t you going to step out?” asked Samuel from the passenger seat, his voice filled with caution.
Noah looked away, his voice devoid of emotion. “Why should I?”
Samuel found himself without a response and chose to remain silent.
A heavy silence settled in the car.
Despite the silence, Noah’s thoughts were restless.
“When will she arrive?” he asked after a pause, his tone edged with annoyance.
“The plane will land in two hours,” Samuel responded promptly.
Acknowledging this with a slight nod, Noah said nothing more, and his eyes drifted back to Sadie, still curled up on the steps. 
.
.

###Chapter 233:noveldrama
As time dragged on, Sadie finally stood, dusting off her clothes. She walked towards the hospital, her steps uncertain. Unseen by her, the black Maybach began to follow at a careful distance, ensuring not to get too close or lag too far behind.
Noah continued to watch her intently, his expression drawn into a tight frown, his lips pressed into a straight line.
What was he really doing? Even Noah himself couldn’t explain. Sadie made her way back to the hospital, straining to maintain her composure.
There was no room for sorrow now. She needed to pull herself together and handle the situation that awaited.
She took out her phone, planning to text Pierre about booking the international flight and sorting out the handover of her studio.
Her fingers moved quickly over the screen.
Time seemed to blur until the hospital room door swung open abruptly. Jim burst in, urgency written all over his face. “Sadie, Kairi has returned.”
Startled, Sadie looked up, but she quickly regained her composure.
She placed her phone aside and asked evenly, “What did you just say?”
Exhaling heavily, Jim relayed, “Kairi’s at the airport. She’s agreed to donate her bone marrow, and the hospital has already dispatched someone to bring her here.”
Sadie’s heart jolted.
Tears she had restrained for so long suddenly spilled over.
Hand over her mouth, Sadie trembled as she wept quietly, overwhelmed by a torrent of relief.
This news seemed to dissolve the heavy burden she had carried. Hope for Averi had been restored.
Jim, standing beside her, watched as Sadie cried uncontrollably. Unsure of how to provide comfort, he simply offered a gentle pat on her shoulder.
Your next story starts here g?lnσνs?c?m
Time seemed to slow as Sadie’s crying eventually eased.
A shadow of doubt then crossed her face.
She had only met Kyla at the cafe earlier that day; now, Kairi had abruptly returned from abroad, ready to donate?
That was fast.
However, Averi’s well-being was the immediate concern.
Everything else would have to be secondary.
Another hour passed, and Kairi was led into the hospital by the medical staff.
Her face was pale, and she appeared worn out, barely resembling her former self.
Upon seeing Sadie, Kairi dropped to her knees with a heavy thud, overwhelmed by guilt. Tears cascaded down her cheeks as she pleaded, “Miss Hudson, I’m so sorry. I was terribly wrong. Please forgive me!”
Holding tightly to the fabric of Sadie’s blouse, Kairi cried with such intensity that her voice strained.
Sadie’s face showed a mix of emotions. “You…”
“Sadie, taking your money and leaving the country was wrong. Greed blinded me. I’ll return every penny. Just give me a chance to make things right!” Kairi pleaded between sobs, her voice growing raspy.
Sadie watched her, her emotions a tangled mess.
The sudden change in Kairi’s attitude seemed too drastic.
The idea of someone having an overnight moral revelation was too much for Sadie to accept.
Moreover, the timing seemed too coincidental.
Could someone other than Kyla be involved? 
.

###Chapter 234:
She helped Kairi to stand, her voice even. “Get up. We need to discuss this properly.”
Tears welled up in Kairi’s eyes as she looked at Sadie with a desperate hope. “Miss Hudson, I’ll donate my bone marrow for Averi. But please, intercede with Mr. Wall for me. Ask him not to ban me in the industry.”
Sadie froze at her words. She instinctively withdrew her hands.
“Ban you?” Sadie frowned slightly. “What do you mean by that?”
Kairi faltered, taken aback by Sadie’s reaction. She bit her lip, uncertain if she should disclose more.
After a brief silence, Kairi seemed to make up her mind. Her voice shook as she said, “Please, Miss Hudson, you know what Mr. Wall’s capable of. I’m just a designer, and being ostracized is what I fear most. If he chooses to destroy me, my career is finished.”
As she continued to implore Sadie, her voice became even more strained.
Fists clenched, Sadie wondered, was Noah the one behind this?
Sadie replayed the memory of Noah’s cold, aloof expression in her mind.
Had he ever offered her a shred of affection?
The thought of him lending her a helping hand seemed ludicrous.
The sharp scent of disinfectant assaulted her senses.
“Sadie, are you ready?”
Jim’s voice gently pulled her from the depths of her reverie.
He was dressed in a sterile suit and mask, and only his kind eyes were visible through the protective layers.
“Yes, I’m ready,” Sadie replied, mustering a forced smile.

Jim gave a nod toward Kairi. “Let’s go.”
Kairi cast a thankful look Sadie’s way before a nurse guided her out.
Following closely, Averi was also wheeled away.
Sadie remained standing, her gaze fixed on the now vacant doorway, her mind tangled in a tumult of confusion and doubt.
She couldn’t fathom it. Why on earth would Noah offer his help?
Shaking her head, she attempted to rid herself of the ridiculous notion. To Noah, she was nothing but an annoyance—a mere obstacle he wished would vanish without a trace.
How could someone who harbored only disdain and indifference possibly reach out to help her?
Sadie’s slender fingers clutched the hem of her coat, her knuckles turning pale from the pressure.
The red surgical light outside the operating room blazed like a warning signal, piercing Sadie’s eyes.
Restlessly, she paced the corridor, her anxiety swelling with each step. Visions of Averi’s delicate, pale face haunted her—how bravely he had whispered, “Mom, don’t cry,” trying to be the comforter despite his own fear.noveldrama
The memory tightened a vice around her heart, making each breath a battle against the sorrow threatening to overwhelm her.
She longed for the cruel reality to dissolve into a mere bad dream, yearning to wake up to Averi’s lively laughter, to see him scampering around, his small hand gripping hers, his cherubic face alight with mischief.
Time crept by, underscored by the intermittent flicker of the corridor lights.
At last, the operating room doors swung open, and a doctor emerged, clad in green scrubs. He peeled off his mask, revealing a weary but reassuring smile. “The surgery was a success,” he announced.
Relief washed over Sadie like a soothing balm. Her heart, which had teetered on the brink of despair, found its footing. Exhausted, she leaned against the cool wall for support, her voice a fragile whisper. “Thank you… thank you, doctor…” 
.

###Chapter 235:
The doctor gave a gentle nod, his expression softening with empathy before he turned away.
Moments later, the doors parted again. There lay Averi, serene and still on the bed, his complexion pallid yet peaceful.
Sadie approached, her steps tentative, and tenderly enveloped his small hand in hers. The familiar warmth spread a quiet assurance through her veins.
Thank goodness, he was safe.
Meanwhile, at Wall Group, the quiet office was disrupted by a sudden knock at the door.
“Come in,” Noah called out in a steady tone.
Samuel entered, closing the door gently behind him and approaching Noah with a deferential air. “Sir, I’m pleased to report that Miss Hudson’s son’s surgery was successful.”
Noah turned around to face Samuel, his eyes fixed on him with an unreadable expression.
He nodded curtly, his lips forming a tight line, and remained silent. Samuel averted his eyes, masking the bewilderment that flickered across his face.
Noah’s way of treating Sadie was a mystery Samuel couldn’t figure out. He had acted like he didn’t care, yet he had quietly made sure her child received the donation.
Noah strode to his desk and snatched up a document, flipping through it. “Anything else?” he asked, his voice flat.
Samuel paused, gathering his courage. “Sir, regarding Kairi…”
“Make sure I never have to see her again,” Noah ordered, his voice cutting.
Bowing his head, Samuel responded, “Understood, sir.”
Your next adventure is at g al n ovels . con
“Wait.”
As Samuel reached the door, Noah’s voice stopped him dead in his tracks.
Pivoting in surprise, Samuel found Noah with his brows knitted in deep thought.
“Sir, may I assist you with anything else?” Samuel inquired, his tone laced with respect.
Noah turned around and walked over to the floor-to-ceiling window, his back to Samuel. His voice floated over, cold and detached. “Do another thing for me.”
A chill crept up Samuel’s spine—Noah’s icy tone was a harbinger of upheaval.
“What would you have me do, sir?” Samuel braced himself for the command.
“Fire Kyla.”
The words struck Samuel like a physical blow, his eyes widening as he stared at Noah’s rigid back.
Kyla—Noah’s once beloved, who had swiftly ascended to a position in the legal department upon her return from abroad. And now… Doubt clouded his thoughts. Hesitating, he ventured, “Sir, just to be clear… you want me to fire Miss Wade?”
Without turning, Noah confirmed firmly, “Indeed. Take care of it now.”
Samuel bit his lip, stifling further questions. Despite his bewilderment, he knew better than to challenge the order.noveldrama
With that, he bowed slightly and made his quiet departure from the office.
Meanwhile, Kyla was humming to herself in her kitchen, unaware of the storm brewing.
As steam filled the kitchen, the sudden vibration of Kyla’s phone sliced through the mist.
Casually drying her hands, Kyla reached for the phone. Her heart sank as she read the termination email from Wall Group’s HR department. The message was brief and cold, informing her that she was fired, effective immediately. 
.

.
###Chapter 236:
Shock flickered across Kyla’s face, quickly giving way to sudden anger.
Her fingers clenched around the phone, her knuckles whitening with the force.
Overwhelmed with anger, Kyla punched in Samuel’s number. “Samuel, what is the meaning of this email?” Kyla blurted out, not giving him a chance to greet her.
Gone was her usual gentleness, replaced by irritation.
From the other end, Samuel’s voice was courteous yet distant. “Miss Wade, please try to remain calm. I regret to inform you that this directive came straight from Mr. Wall.”
“From Noah? Why on earth would he fire me? What have I done to deserve this?” Kyla’s voice trembled with confusion and hurt, especially after her recent efforts to show her devotion through a meticulously prepared soup.
After a slight hesitation, Samuel replied, maintaining his composure, “I’m sorry, Miss Wade, but I don’t know the reasons. I’m only carrying out orders. You might want to speak directly with Mr. Wall.”
Samuel hung up abruptly.
The phone beeped monotonously, each sound slicing through Kyla, sharp and painful.
She shook with anger, her grip on her phone so intense it seemed it might shatter.
Confused and hurt, she wondered why Noah was treating her this way. Was it because of Sadie?
No other name came to mind as someone who could prompt Noah to act so decisively against her.
It must be Sadie’s doing!
As she pondered, Kyla grew increasingly certain that Sadie was involved. Or could it be that Noah had uncovered something?
Fresh chapters live gαlnσν?s?com
A chilling fear washed over her.
Eager for answers, Kyla decided to call Kairi right away to get to the bottom of things.
In a rush, Kyla skimmed through her contacts, selected Kairi’s number, and made the call. The line beeped repeatedly.
After a lengthy wait, it became clear that no one would pick up.
Kyla’s heart sank. A chill of dread washed over her.
Determined, she switched to WhatsApp to message Kairi. “Where are you? This can’t wait. We need to talk.”
Her message was sent without issue, yet there was no immediate response.
Kyla’s heart pounded with anxiety.
When she tried to message Kairi again, she only saw a single grey check mark. She realized she had been blocked.
At Wall Group, the lights in Noah’s office shone brightly, intensifying the stern lines of his face.
“Mr. Wall, I’ve finished the tasks,” Samuel stated formally, standing straight before the desk.
With a subtle nod, Noah remained expressionless.noveldrama
Samuel watched him closely, trying to gauge his thoughts.
Noah tapped his long fingers rhythmically on the desk, making a deliberate sound. “Samuel, you can go home.”
Samuel responded quickly, “Yes, Mr. Wall.” He promptly exited the office.
With Samuel gone, Noah was the only one left in the spacious office.
He rose slowly and moved toward the window.
As he massaged his temples, a wave of irritation swept over him. The surgery for the boy was over. Perhaps now, Sadie might find some peace.
Noah let out a soft sigh, picked up his suit jacket from the chair’s back, and departed from the office.

###Chapter 237:noveldrama
Echoing footsteps filled the deserted hallway, underscoring his solitude. Making his way to the elevator, Noah pressed the button for the underground parking lot.
At Myrtlewood Estate, Kyla perched on a cream-colored leather sofa, her slender fingers nervously playing with the hem of her plain white dress.
She had hurried here immediately after receiving her dismissal notice and had been waiting ever since.
Footsteps she knew all too well resonated from the doorway, causing her to look up sharply, her eyes filled with tears.
Noah entered, pushing the door open. His black suit contrasted with his stoic, chiseled features, which showed no emotion.
“Noah,” Kyla’s voice broke as she rose unsteadily, moving toward him. Vulnerability tinged her natural grace, rendering her appearance rather pitiful. “Tell me, why are you doing this to me?”
Ignoring her tearful appeal, Noah headed straight for the bar to pour himself a glass of whiskey.
“I don’t understand what I’ve done to make you despise me so much. I can leave this instant and vanish from your life…” Kyla turned to leave, her heart making silent calculations.
She was sure Noah wouldn’t let her leave.
Yet, Noah didn’t respond and just stood there, merely continuing to sip his whiskey, seemingly oblivious to the drama unfolding.
Kyla’s lip quivered as she bit it.
She clutched her chest and suddenly collapsed to the floor in a faint. When Noah saw this, his expression tightened, a jolt of concern flashing through him.
He rushed over, lifting Kyla carefully and laying her on the sofa. “Kyla! Kyla!”
Tears brimmed in Kyla’s eyes as she slowly opened them. “Noah…” she whispered, her voice faint, barely audible. “My heart… it hurts so much… Remember the time when I saved you? That was when… when I first got hurt…” She spoke with pauses, her voice heavy with sadness. She was playing her trump card, betting on Noah’s sense of indebtedness from their past.
L?tt ?hαpt?rs n glov?l.?m
Observing her frail appearance, Noah let out a sigh. “You don’t have to worry. I’ll be here for you.” He carefully lifted Kyla in his arms and strode toward the door.
The hospital hallways carried the potent scent of disinfectant.
Approaching a doctor, Noah inquired, “Doctor, how is she?”
Removing his mask, the doctor responded, “She needs to remain under observation. We must wait for her test results to learn more.”
As Kyla lay on the hospital bed, her complexion washed out, she managed a weak smile. “Noah, could you… get me something to eat?”
Noticing the expectation in her eyes, Noah assured her, “Okay. I’ll find you something to eat.”
He then exited, his tall silhouette disappearing down the corridor. Kyla watched him leave, then slowly sat up, the fragility of before absent. She walked to the doctor’s office and tapped on the door.
“Please, come in.”
Kyla stepped inside, pulling out a thick envelope from her bag and setting it on the doctor’s desk.
“This is just a small token of my gratitude. I’m sure you know how to report on my condition, right?”
The doctor took the envelope discreetly, his face breaking into a smile. “Rest assured, Miss Wade. I’ve got this under control.”
Kyla gave a nod of approval and exited the office.

###Chapter 238:
After she left, a subtle noise came from a hidden door within the room. Emerging from behind it was Jim, his height and gold-rimmed glasses lending him an authoritative air. His eyes, keen and observant behind the glass, missed nothing.noveldrama
He had been sorting through documents and had inadvertently caught the exchange between Kyla and the doctor.
Walking up to the doctor with a composed demeanor, Jim said, “I believe I just caught a rather intriguing conversation.”
The doctor’s smile stiffened, and he glanced around anxiously, sweat beginning to bead on his brow.
He attempted to hide the envelope in a drawer, but Jim swiftly intervened, pinning his hand down. “And what might this be?” Jim held the envelope, noticing its weight and grasping its significance. The doctor looked uneasy, fumbling for words.
“It’s… it’s nothing. Just a small gift…”
“A small gift?” Jim scoffed coldly, tossing the envelope back onto the desk. “A small gift to skew medical opinions? What happened to your professional integrity?”
The doctor felt overwhelmed by Jim’s domineering stance, struggling to find his voice.
He got up hurriedly, trying to move past Jim to escape.
“Stay where you are!” Jim exclaimed, his voice stern and authoritative. Rooted to the spot, the doctor shuddered, unable to move.
Jim closed in slowly, cornering the doctor until he was backed against the wall with no way out.
“What… what do you want from me?”
“What exactly did Kyla request of you?” Jim pressed.
Trying to mask his desperation, the doctor flashed an insincere smile, his eyes scanning for an exit. “It’s merely a small token for my efforts, really. Dr. Archer, you’ve got bigger things to worry about. Why fuss over such trivial matters?”
L€$? ￠tя? ?η ?@ln?νêl?.￠
He tried once again to slip past Jim.
But Jim caught his arm firmly, his hold inescapable.
“A token for your efforts? Your definition of ‘efforts’ seems quite unique.”
Beads of sweat streamed down the doctor’s face, the chill from the air conditioning unit failing to alleviate his tension.
With a forced chuckle, he tried to lighten the mood. “Oh, Dr. Archer, you must be kidding me. I wouldn’t dream of stepping out of line.”
Despite his efforts to free himself, Jim’s grip remained as steadfast as steel.
Tightening his hold slightly, Jim saw the doctor’s face turn pale.
“Stop playing dumb. If you value your career, you’ll tell me the truth.”
Grimacing from the discomfort, the doctor drew a sharp breath. He was well aware that although Jim looked just like another doctor, his family actually owned the hospital.
Jim’s authority was not to be underestimated.
“Look, Dr. Archer, you know, some women aim to seem frail to garner sympathy from men. Miss Wade isn’t really sick; she simply instructed me to exaggerate her condition.”
Jim furrowed his brow, knowing that such tricks might deceive Noah. He decided not to delve deeper into the issue.
He said, “You can’t keep this money. The hospital will take it, and someone from the medical affairs department will reach out to you tomorrow.”
Jim took the envelope and exited.
Emerging from the hospital’s convenience store with a jar in hand, Noah collided with Alex as he rounded a corner.

###Chapter 239:
The encounter with Noah was unexpected for Alex as well.noveldrama
“You appear quite relaxed. Despite being the child’s biological father, you didn’t donate bone marrow. Instead, you were actively searching for a donor. It’s…” Noah’s voice was laden with irony as he continued, “Remarkable.”
Alex’s smile disappeared in an instant.
Noah didn’t wait for a reply and turned on his heel to leave.
Alex’s shoulders drooped, a feeling of defeat washing over him. Pausing at the hospital’s entrance, Noah seemed uncertain for a moment.
Eventually, he gave the insulated food jar to a nurse. “Could you please give this to Kyla Wade?”
Accepting the jar, the nurse nodded and said, “Of course, Mr. Wall.” Noah then departed without further delay.
The nurse wheeled a cart towards Kyla’s room and knocked softly on the door.
“Come in.” Kyla’s voice was weak, tinged with a faint trace of anticipation.
She had hoped it might be Noah.
Upon entering, the nurse placed the food jar on the bedside table.
“Miss Wade, Mr. Wall asked me to bring this to you.”
Kyla looked at the jar, the spark in her eyes quickly fading.
“Thank you,” she responded coldly, no longer carrying the weakness from before.
Nodding politely, the nurse exited the room.
Kyla eyed the food jar with a mix of anger and disgust, her delicate features contorting in frustration.
With a forceful yank, she removed the lid, and the aroma of chicken soup filled the air.
Her face twisted in distaste as her stomach churned.
Your escape begins with ga ln ov els . com
With a slam, the food jar hit the floor, and the soup spilled out, staining the pristine sheets beneath it.
In a fit of rage, Kyla ripped at her IV, her breathing heavy and uncontrolled.
Dizziness overwhelmed her as she sat up too quickly.
She gripped the bed frame, taking deep breaths to regain her composure.
She left her room, her walk shaky, her eyes empty.
She had believed that Sadie’s absence would heal her bond with Noah, but instead, things had only gotten worse.
Upon reaching another ward’s open doorway, Kyla froze.
It was Kairi.
Kyla stormed in, exclaiming, “Kairi!”
Leaning against the head of the hospital bed, Kairi appeared pale and weak from her recent bone marrow donation.
Startled by the noise, Kairi flinched, dropping her apple to the floor with a thud.
Hatred seethed from Kyla as she closed the distance, every step charged with the intent to confront.
Terror widened Kairi’s eyes as she instinctively moved backward, finding herself cornered with no escape. Her hands clenched the blanket, knuckles bleaching under the strain, eyes flitting about anxiously. “Wh-what do you want?”
Kyla sneered, looking down at her. “What do I want? Isn’t it obvious? You took my money, and yet you have the audacity to return?”
Kyla grabbed Kairi by the collar, pulling her close. Too weak to fight back, Kairi could only tremble in fear.
“Miss Wade, I had no choice!” she exclaimed. “I couldn’t afford to cross Mr. Wall. If I’d known you were going against him, I never would have agreed. I’ll give back every penny you paid me.”

###Chapter 240:
With a jolt, Kyla let go of Kairi’s collar, wiping her hands as if to rid herself of the filth.
Her voice dropped to a menacing whisper. “If you utter a single word about this…” She let the threat hang in the air, her eyes conveying a clear warning.
Cowering, Kairi retreated further into the bed.
Kyla turned around, her high heels clicking sharply against the floor. As the door to the ward slammed shut, it obscured Kairi’s terrified expression.
Anger swelled within Kyla.
Kairi had completely shattered all of her careful arrangements!
Diving into her designer handbag, Kyla retrieved her phone and quickly dialed Jordyn’s number.
As the call connected, Jordyn’s overly sweet tone filled the phone. “What can I do for you, Miss Wade?”
“Jordyn, didn’t you promise to send Kairi abroad?!” Kyla’s voice sliced through the air, sharp as a blade.
A hesitant silence followed before Jordyn replied, noticeably unnerved, “I have made those arrangements, Miss Wade, but—”
“But what?!” Kyla’s frustration erupted. “She was right in front of me! How am I supposed to handle this now?! You can kiss your future as the design director at Alice Design Studio goodbye!”
The line went silent, leaving only the sound of Jordyn’s rapid breathing.
“Miss Wade… Miss Wade! You have to hear me out—we still have an option!” Jordyn’s voice wavered, laced with desperation.
Kyla’s tone was cold. “And what option is that?”noveldrama
“Alice Design Studio is tied to Sadie’s business through a collaboration. If we pull the right strings, she’ll be out of the picture—easily.” Jordyn’s words dripped with urgency, clinging to this last sliver of hope.
Stay updated g?lnσνes?com
“Oh?” Kyla’s interest was piqued. “I’m listening.”
Jordyn wasted no time, laying out her plan, every move meticulously calculated.
“Sadie’s studio is handling a critical project right now. All it takes is one well-placed disruption and…”
Silence stretched between them. Then, Kyla exhaled slowly, her voice cutting through the air like a blade. “Jordyn, this is your last chance. If this fails again, consider your career buried.” Without another word, the line went dead.
Meanwhile, in Averi’s hospital room, Sadie leaned against the headboard, holding a fairy tale book in her hands. Her voice was soft, soothing, as she read aloud, coaxing the restless child in her arms to sleep.
Averi’s flushed cheeks and fluttering lashes made him look impossibly delicate, his tiny fingers clutching at Sadie’s collar as he murmured something incomprehensible. Sleep eluded him, his grip firm, as if he feared she might disappear.
Then, a gentle knock echoed against the door.
“Come in,” Sadie murmured softly.
The door opened, and Alex stepped inside, his tall frame silhouetted against the dim light. In his hand, he carried a delicate thermos box.
“Averi’s still awake?” he asked quietly, his gaze settling on the small boy nestled in Sadie’s arms.
Sadie let out a weary sigh, her lips curving into a faint, resigned smile. “He just won’t settle tonight.”
The exhaustion in her voice was unmistakable. Her once-vibrant eyes had lost some of their luster, and the pallor of her skin made her seem even more fragile. Lately, her health had been faltering, and though she tried to hide it, the weight of it lingered in the air.
Alex placed the thermos on the nightstand. “I brought you something to eat. You should have it while it’s still warm.”

###Chapter 241:
“Thank you,” Sadie said, a flicker of gratitude passing through her tired gaze.
Averi stirred in her arms, his tiny fingers gripping her collar with surprising strength. His wide, glossy eyes darted around the room, his lips parting as if he was searching for the right words. Then, in a tiny, drowsy voice, he whispered, “Mommy…”
Sadie’s heart clenched. She tilted her head, brushing her fingers gently through his soft hair. “What is it, sweetheart?”
Averi lifted a small hand and pointed toward the window. Outside, the city pulsed with life. Neon lights flickered against the night sky, their colorful glow painting soft patterns on the walls. “Go out… play…” he murmured, his voice still thick with sleep, his little face full of longing.
Sadie’s breath hitched. For a moment, she couldn’t speak. How she wished she could take her little boy outside, let him feel the crisp night air, hear his laughter echo through the quiet streets. But… he had just come out of surgery.
Sadie’s hesitation was brief but noticeable. Alex caught it immediately.
His voice was warm, reassuring. “Where do you want to go, buddy?” He crouched slightly, meeting Averi’s gaze. “Once you feel better, I’ll take you wherever you want.”
Sadie blinked, surprised. She hadn’t expected that.
Averi’s face lit up instantly. He clapped his tiny hands in excitement. “Great! Alex will take me out!”
In the next second, he wriggled free from Sadie’s arms, wrapping his small arms around Alex’s leg.
Sadie watched them, her heart a tangled mess of emotions—gratitude, warmth, and something far more complicated.
Comforted by the promise, Averi stopped fussing and finally drifted into sleep, his tiny breaths even and soft.
Ten minutes passed.
The room fell into a hush, the quiet only broken by the rhythmic sound of the little one’s breathing.
Sadie adjusted Averi’s blanket with a gentle touch before rising to her feet. She walked toward the window, drawn to the city lights flickering beyond the glass.
Alex followed, his steps light, his gaze never leaving her. She looked… fragile. Too thin. Too pale.
“Sadie.” His voice was quiet, careful. “Let me take care of you. Both of you.”
She turned. Their eyes met, and for a moment, the world seemed to still. Then, she shook her head. A slow, gentle refusal.
“Alex… please don’t.” Her voice was barely above a whisper. “These past three years, I’ve already relied on you too much. I know you mean well, but…” She exhaled, the words heavy on her tongue. “But I’ve learned to take care of Averi on my own. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone else.” Her voice softened further, almost breaking. “Besides… between us…”
She didn’t finish, but Alex heard everything she didn’t say.
There were too many gaps between them.
A dull ache spread through Alex’s chest, sharp and relentless. He reached out instinctively, his fingers hovering just inches from Sadie’s cheek. But then he hesitated—paused midair—before letting his hand drop.
A faint, bitter smile flickered across his lips. “Sadie,” he murmured, his voice laced with something raw. “You always carry everything alone. Have you ever considered… that you don’t have to?”
Sadie lifted her gaze, meeting his eyes—the quiet sincerity in them, the unspoken plea. A warmth stirred in her chest.
But she buried it just as quickly.

###Chapter 242:
“I’ve already made up my mind, Alex,” she said gently but firmly. “I want to restart my career. I want to build something better for Averi. A future he can be proud of.”
A long, quiet sigh left Alex’s lips. For a moment, he seemed as if he wanted to say more, to argue, to convince her. But instead, he simply nodded, retreating. “Alright,” he said finally. “I respect your decision.” Then, with a quiet kind of devotion, he added, “But if you ever need anything… anything at all, just say the word.”
Sadie’s lips curved into a small, grateful smile. “Thank you, Alex.”noveldrama
A few days later, Sadie sat by the hospital bed, her eyes fixed on Averi as he slept with a serene expression. A smile gently played at the edges of her mouth.
“He’s doing much better and can go home today,” Jim said as he stepped through the door, his face breaking into a warm smile. “Just remember, he needs lots of rest. Don’t let him get too tired.”
Standing up, Sadie expressed her gratitude. “I appreciate everything, Dr. Archer,” she said, a sense of relief in her voice.
Averi’s quick recovery over the recent days was a testament to the excellent care he had received.
Gently caressing Averi’s soft cheeks, Sadie whispered excitedly, “Sweetie, we’re heading home today!”
Averi opened his eyes slowly, his face lighting up with a radiant smile upon seeing his mother. “Mommy, let’s go home!” he exclaimed.
The joy in Averi’s voice melted Sadie’s heart instantly.
She lifted him in her arms, planting a soft kiss on his cheek. “Alright, let’s head out.”
With the discharge paperwork complete, Sadie carried her son out of the hospital.
Once home, she carefully placed Averi on the floor. He scurried off, his little legs carrying him unsteadily toward his toys.

Turning to Carol, Sadie outlined some precautions. “Averi’s just come home, so let’s keep his meals light and steer clear of anything heavy or spicy. And no rough play for a while. Make sure he stays safe, please.”
Carol nodded a few times. “Don’t worry, Miss Hudson. I’ll take good care of Averi.”
As she watched Averi playing with pure joy, warmth spread through Sadie’s heart.
The following morning, Sadie dressed in a crisp off-white suit that complimented her slim frame. She had her long hair neatly pulled back into a bun, showcasing her graceful neck.
Her makeup was subtle yet effective, concealing her recent tiredness and accentuating her soft features and poised demeanor.
As the elevator climbed quietly, a flutter of nervousness touched Sadie’s heart.
Ding—
With the sound, the elevator doors slid open and Sadie stepped out.
She had just approached the door to the design department when a familiar figure hurried toward her, linking arms with her in an excited gesture.
“Sadie! You’re back!” exclaimed Tina, her face alight with enthusiasm as she drew Sadie into the department. “So much has happened here—it’s like something out of a TV drama!”
Tina pulled Sadie along, causing her to stumble slightly as she tried to match Tina’s brisk pace.
“What happened? Explain it to me, but take your time,” Sadie said.
In a quieter section of the area, Tina leaned in and whispered with a hint of mystery, “You won’t believe this—Kyla’s been fired!”
Sadie stopped cold at the news.
Her brows, perfectly arched, knitted together slightly as astonishment flickered in her eyes. “Fired? Why?” 
.

###Chapter 243:
Tina moved even closer, her voice dropping to a hush. “From what I’ve gathered, she mishandled a major project! Mr. Wall was so outraged that he dismissed her right then and there!”
For a brief moment, Sadie remained silent, her feelings a tangled web. She averted her eyes, concealing the inner chaos. “I see…”
Recognizing Sadie’s subdued reaction, Tina jumped to conclusions, mistaking it for concern. “Don’t worry, though. Yes, the partnership faced some challenges, but we’ve managed to stabilize things.” A light nod was Sadie’s only response.
“By the way, where have you disappeared to lately? You’ve been missed!” Tina said, her round eyes filled with both concern and curiosity.
Sadie quietly gathered her thoughts and offered a faint smile, keeping her tone steady. “My child fell ill and had to be hospitalized.”
Concern washed over Tina’s face. “Oh no, is it serious? Is everything alright now?”
“He’s doing much better. Thanks. He was discharged and is back home now.” Sadie offered reassurance.
It appeared Tina had more questions, but their conversation was interrupted as a man in a dark blue suit, with glasses, approached. He offered Sadie a polite nod and said respectfully, “Miss Hudson, Mr. Zane would like to meet with you.”noveldrama
Sadie hesitated, then recognition dawned upon her.
That referred to Gregory Zane, the head of design at Wall Group. With a regretful smile at Tina, Sadie excused herself. “We’ll talk more later, okay?”
Tina gave a nod and watched as Sadie departed.
Sadie tapped lightly on Gregory’s office door, which was slightly open. A firm male voice responded, “Come in.”
She nudged the door wider and stepped inside. A middle-aged man was reviewing documents at the desk.
“Mr. Zane, you asked to see me?”
? ?  .
Gregory raised his head, his gaze assessing Sadie briefly, admiration flickering momentarily.
Her demeanor exuded elegance, and there was a subtle resilience in her expression, marking her as distinctly competent.
“Miss Hudson, please take a seat,” Gregory said, motioning to the chair across from him.
The client is beyond pleased with ‘Timeless Love.'” Gregory set down the documents with a satisfied nod. “A collaboration between Wall Group and you is nothing short of extraordinary, Miss Hudson. No wonder you’re being hailed as the rising star on the international stage. The jewelry was successfully handed over to the client yesterday.”
Sadie’s slender fingers tightened around her handbag, her expression clouding. “Timeless Love?”
Her clear eyes met Gregory’s, and for some inexplicable reason, her heart skipped a beat at the faint admiration in his gaze.
“Yes. Is something wrong?” Gregory adjusted his glasses, his brows slightly furrowed in confusion.
Sadie hesitated for a breath before speaking. “Mr. Zane… isn’t Timeless Love the theme of Mr. Wall and Miss Wade’s wedding?”
The room fell into a brief silence.
Gregory stiffened, his usually composed demeanor cracking for a fraction of a second. His eyes widened slightly behind his glasses before he blinked, quickly recovering. “Wedding?” he echoed, a beat too late. “No!” He paused to clear his throat, before explaining, “This was a business project personally approved by Mr. Wall. I—I assumed you were aware of it…”
A flush crept up Sadie’s cheeks.
She forced a small nod, her lips curving into a barely-there smile. “Oh right. Of course. I must have mixed things up.” 
.

###Chapter 244:
She dropped her gaze, her thick lashes veiling the complex emotions swirling behind her eyes.
Kyla lied to her…
Gregory’s voice pulled her back. “Miss Hudson, are you absolutely sure about not renewing the contract?” His tone was measured, but there was an unmistakable hope lingering beneath it. “Wall Group would be lucky to keep someone of your caliber.”
Sadie inhaled slowly, steadying herself before meeting his gaze. “Mr. Zane, I truly appreciate the opportunity,” she said, her voice unwavering. “But this chapter is closed. It’s time for me to move forward.”
There was no hesitation, no room for negotiation.
She rose from her seat with quiet grace, offering a polite nod. “I’ll be taking my leave now.”
Gregory watched her go, exhaling a sigh as his fingers drummed against the desk.
Such a pity.
Her storeroom office smelled of dust and aged metal, the dim, flickering light above casting eerie shadows along the walls. Sadie stumbled in, gripping the nearest shelf to steady herself.
Her head swam, her thoughts spiraling into a tangled mess.
Kairi… That name felt like a dagger, lodged deep in her chest.
If it hadn’t been for Noah… perhaps, Averi…
A sickening thought clawed at the edges of her mind, but she refused to let it take form. She squeezed her eyes shut, willing it away. A long, slow breath escaped her lips. It was over. At least… for now.
She made her way to her desk, moving with quiet determination. Rolling up her design drafts with careful precision, she secured them with a rubber band and slid them into a worn canvas bag.noveldrama
Then—
The newest releases are at g?lnσνs?com
A soft creak echoed through the storeroom.
The door edged open, light spilling into the dim space. A shadowed figure stepped inside. It was Samuel.
“Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall requests your presence in his office.” Samuel’s voice was calm and respectful.
Sadie lifted her gaze, ice glinting in her eyes. “What does Mr. Wall want now? Our cooperation should be over by now, right?”
Samuel hesitated, the briefest flicker of unease crossing his face before he regained his composure. “I’m just following instructions, Mrs. Wall.”
“Mrs. Wall?” Sadie let out a dry, humorless chuckle. She repeated the title, rolling it on her tongue as if it were something absurd. “Mr. Ford, do me a favor—don’t call me that again. A name that was never acknowledged three years ago means even less now.”
Her voice was steady, but beneath it lay a quiet storm of emotions she refused to let surface. She exhaled sharply, unwilling to waste another second in this place. The air itself felt stifling.
“Fine,” she muttered. “Let’s go.” She turned on her heel and strode toward the exit.
Samuel followed closely behind, wisely keeping his silence.
The top-floor office was drenched in warm sunlight, streaming through vast floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the city skyline. Noah sat behind his massive desk, his back to the door, shoulders squared, posture rigid.
A soft knock disturbed the heavy silence. Samuel stepped inside. “Mr. Wall, she’s here.”
Slowly, Noah turned his chair, locking his eyes with Sadie.
“Just tell me why I’m here,” she said, her voice calm but devoid of warmth. “Oh, and one more thing, if you have time, let’s finally finalize the divorce.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 245:
Three years. That was how long this had been left unresolved.
Noah’s expression flickered—just for a second. A shadow of surprise crossed his eyes before his face hardened, his jaw tightening. His voice was laced with something unreadable. “You’re that eager to leave?”
Sadie felt an ironic laugh bubble up inside her. Was he being serious?
He had been the one to propose the divorce in the first place. And now he was acting like this? Did he even realize how contradictory he sounded?
“What’s this, Mr. Wall?” Her tone was laced with quiet amusement. “Are you reluctant to let me go now?”
Noah rose to his feet, his movements slow, deliberate. He stepped toward her, his imposing frame casting a long shadow across the room. Sadie’s breath hitched as her instinct kicked in, and she took a step back.
“What are you doing? Noah, don’t—don’t try anything reckless.”
Noah fixed a deep, questioning look on Sadie. “Are you so desperate to get away from me?”
Sadie’s heart missed a beat as she lifted her gaze, her hands clenched. “You are well aware of what occurred three years ago. There is nothing remaining for us.”
Abruptly, the sound of the office door slamming open echoed through the room.
Isabel, radiating elegance and authority, strode in furiously.
Her expertly done makeup did little to hide the anger on her face as she stared down Sadie. “You’re such a seductress! A curse on everyone around you! How dare you appear here? What kind of spell have you cast on Noah?”
Silently, Sadie stood her ground, her expression calm and detached. She had already become immune to Isabel’s biting words three years ago.
Now, such remarks merely blended into the background, insignificant and dismissed.
Stay connected at g?lnσν?s?c?m
With a subtle suppression of her feelings, Sadie turned to leave.
This action caught Isabel off guard.
How dare Sadie show such audacity!
Three years ago, Sadie had always been timid and submissive around her.noveldrama
Now, she didn’t even let her finish speaking before she started to walk away!
Isabel’s anger flared, boiling to the surface.
She reached out, aiming to seize Sadie and give her a stern reprimand. Feeling Isabel’s approach, Sadie hastened her steps.
She had no desire to remain entangled with the Wall family any longer.
As he observed the unfolding drama, Noah’s expression grew tense. He quickly moved, catching Sadie’s wrist and leading her swiftly out of the office.
Sadie grimaced from the tight grip but offered no resistance.
Any struggle now would only add to her embarrassment.
Isabel was left speechless, watching Noah lead Sadie away. Momentarily, she was too taken aback to respond.
“Samuel, make sure my mother gets back to Wall Manor,” Noah instructed without looking back at Isabel.
Isabel, recovering from her initial shock, pointed at Noah’s departing back and yelled, “Noah! Have you lost your senses? Are you really choosing her over your own mother?!”
Noah disregarded Isabel’s furious rant, guiding Sadie firmly towards the elevator.

.
###Chapter 246:
As the elevator doors closed, Isabel’s shouts were abruptly silenced. Once inside, Noah released Sadie’s wrist.
She quietly massaged the reddened skin where his grip had been, casting her eyes downward, remaining silent.noveldrama
The air between them in the elevator grew thick with tension. Noah’s gaze remained fixed on Sadie, emotions swirling uncertainly in his eyes.
Feeling his stare, Sadie raised her eyes to meet his intense, unreadable look. The depths of his emotions were a mystery to her.
Her voice was low yet distinct when she spoke. “Thank you, Mr. Wall. I’m merely an outsider. There’s no need to compromise your relationship with your mother on my behalf.”
A shadow crossed Noah’s face, his mouth set in a firm line, and he remained silent.
The only sound in the elevator was their subdued breathing, adding to the stifling atmosphere.
A surge of bitterness welled up in Sadie’s heart.
She chuckled ruefully to herself.
“I’ll see you at the courthouse at nine tomorrow morning, Mr. Wall.”
Ding—
Slowly, the elevator doors parted, revealing a crack of light.
Sadie didn’t pause; she stepped out of the elevator and continued on her way.
Leaving the premises of Wall Group, she went straight for her studio. Upon opening the door to the studio, she was immediately taken aback by the scene before her.
Stay tuned for more gαlnσνs.c○m
The air was alive with floating streamers, and twinkling fairy lights added a festive glow.
The table was laden with an array of fine pastries and bottles of champagne, while her colleagues surrounded it, smiles lighting up their faces.
“Welcome back, Sadie, our queen!” Tina held up her champagne glass, her eyes crinkling with joy.
“Sadie, we’re all so glad you’re safe!”
Caught off guard, Sadie blinked, still trying to grasp the scene unfolding before her. “What’s all this about…?”
Her gaze swept over her colleagues, marked by a look of bewilderment.
“The Wall Group just transferred the final payment—ten million, no less! It’s more than we initially agreed upon. They included extra for emotional distress and revision fees,” Tina said, approaching with a wide smile.
Hearing the figure, Sadie felt her heart leap. The amount was beyond what she had anticipated.
“Noah…” Sadie muttered under her breath, lost in a whirlwind of emotions.
Tina beamed with visible enthusiasm, her eyes sparkling as she gushed, “Sadie, you have to admit Mr. Wall is not only generous but also ridiculously handsome and wealthy!”
She clasped her hands together as if in awe. “He truly values what your studio created.”
“Absolutely! His generosity is unmatched!”
Sadie’s colleagues joined in with equal enthusiasm, the studio echoing with laughter and infused with a warm, familial vibe.

###Chapter 247:
Sadie scanned the room, her heart swelling with a sense of belonging as she absorbed the cheerful scene.
However, the light-hearted atmosphere soon gave way to hushed whispers and speculative murmurs.
A young designer leaned in close to the one next to her, voice dropping to a secretive whisper. “Did you hear? Kyla was let go from the Wall Group.”
“You’ve got to be kidding. Kyla is one of the best, isn’t she?”
“I swear it’s true. A friend working in Wall Group’s legal department told me personally.”
“Does this mean… Mr. Wall and Kyla are finally getting married? Is she stepping down to become Mrs. Wall?”
Curious eyes suddenly turned towards Sadie, their expressions a mix of intrigue and expectation.
One particularly bold colleague, a mischievous grin tugging at her lips, ventured, “Sadie, you’ve been with Wall Group for a long time. You must have heard some juicy stories, right? What’s the real scoop with Mr. Wall and Kyla?”
Sadie froze for a moment, caught off guard by the sudden inquiry. She forced a smile onto her lips but didn’t respond. With a quick turn, she stepped back into her office.
“Everyone, stop wasting time on gossip and get back to work!” Tina commanded, her voice cutting through the mounting whispers with clear authority. As the office door clicked shut behind her, it muffled the bustling chatter outside.
Leaning against the cool, sturdy door, Sadie released a long, weary sigh. She massaged her temples gently, her expression creased with evident exhaustion.
Kyla got fired. And… Noah seemed completely out of character today. Suddenly, a series of soft knocks echoed at the door. The sound snapped her out of her reverie.
“Come in,” she called out while walking towards her chair.
The door opened to reveal Tina, who stepped in with a comforting presence, her hands cradling a cup of steaming coffee. “Sadie, are you alright?”
Her voice dripped with concern as she set the coffee down on the cluttered desk.
Sadie managed a weak nod and a subdued smile. “I’m fine, just feeling a bit tired. What’s up, Tina? What brings you here?” she inquired, her tone lightening a touch.
With a playful wink, Tina settled into the chair across from her. “Of course I’m here to celebrate with you. Also, I’ve brought the payment receipt.” She paused, her eyes twinkling with mischief. “You know, every time I step into this studio, it makes me want to leave Wall Group and join your team. Everyone here is so talented and supportive, and the clients? Incredibly generous.”
With a theatrical flourish, Tina pretended to count stacks of bills, her voice tinged with awe. “Ten million dollars! Holy crap! I couldn’t make that in a hundred lifetimes!”
Just as the laughter was fading, the studio door slammed open with a jarring crash.
Pierre, Sadie’s assistant, stumbled in, his usual composure shattered, his face drained of color.
“Miss… Miss Hudson, there’s bad news,” he stammered, breathless from urgency. noveldrama

###Chapter 248:
The light-hearted atmosphere snapped like a fragile thread.
Tina’s smile faded into a mask of concern, mirroring the sudden tension that gripped the room.
Sadie’s stomach clenched with a sinking feeling, an ominous premonition creeping up her spine.
She drew a deep, steadying breath, her brows furrowing with determination. “Pierre, slow down. Breathe. Then tell me, what’s going on?”
Pierre inhaled shakily, his voice barely above a whisper. “The… the Cardilla Pink Diamond… it’s gone, missing.”
“What?” Sadie’s voice cracked in disbelief, her hand accidentally sweeping a pile of documents off her desk. Papers fluttered to the floor like fallen leaves, scattering in a chaotic dance as her complexion paled.
The Cardilla Pink Diamond, the irreplaceable gemstone that was the heart of Leanna’s “Ten Year Promise,” priceless in both value and prestige.
Dread pooled in Sadie’s chest as the room seemed to tilt around her, her vision dimming with the weight of the catastrophe.
If they had to find a replacement now, especially from an international source, meeting the looming deadline would be nothing short of a miracle.
Sadie shut her eyes for a fleeting moment, summoning every ounce of her will to maintain her composure. Panic was not an option here.
“What in the world has happened? Lay it out for me—clearly,” she demanded, her voice quivering yet imbued with an unmistakable command. “When did we discover it was missing? And who was the last one to handle it?”
Pierre, visibly flustered, scoured his memory. “This morning, I checked the safe, intending to take it to the production room. The lock seemed untouched, but when I opened it… it was empty. The diamond—gone.
I also checked the surveillance footage, but it seems last night’s recordings have vanished.”
Read exclusive stories .c〇m
Sadie’s breath hitched as an eerie coldness washed over her entire body.
The surveillance footage had vanished?
How the hell did that happen?
Her fists clenched unconsciously, nails biting into the flesh of her palms.
Tina, witnessing the ghostly pallor of Sadie’s face, stepped closer and gently took her hand, offering a comforting squeeze. “Sadie, don’t worry. We’ll figure this out and get the diamond back.”
Managing a strained smile, Sadie replied, “Thank you, Tina. I just need a moment to process this. You should head back now.”noveldrama
With a sympathetic nod, Tina exited the office, leaving Sadie and Pierre alone.
Silence enveloped the room, punctuated only by the rhythmic tapping of Sadie’s fingers against her desk—a sharp, insistent sound that seemed to echo her inner turmoil.
“Pierre, just stay calm. It already happened. Losing your composure isn’t going to help us fix this.”
Despite the turmoil that raged inside her, Sadie’s voice was steady and resolute. “Our main priority right now is solving the problem at hand. Contact all the jewelers we know abroad. We need a pink diamond of the same grade shipped over as soon as possible. Tell them price is not an issue, but they need to send it over at the earliest available time.”
Pierre paused for a moment before snapping back to his senses and nodded eagerly. “Yes, Miss Hudson. I’m on it!” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 249:noveldrama
“Reach out to the local jewelers as well. See if they have anything similar. It might be a long shot, but it’s better to cover all the bases.”
Pierre nodded again before dashing through the door, leaving only silence in his wake.
Barely a minute had passed when the door burst open again, and in walked Nanette Barton from the PR department. She rushed over to Sadie, her face pale, her expression tight.
“I’m afraid I have bad news, Miss Hudson! It’s all over the Internet! Someone leaked the matter to the press, and now, everyone’s talking about the missing Cardilla Pink Diamond. People are making bets on whether we’re able to deliver on time or not, and it looks like the consensus is against us.”
Sadie’s expression turned even more grim.
She had no time to check who was responsible for the leak. She needed to take control of the ongoing narrative and reassure everyone involved.
“Give all the major media outlets a call. Issue an official statement saying that we are in the process of remedying the situation and we shall deliver on time. Also, keep a close eye on the online forums and prepare for crisis management as the story develops.”
Nanette bobbed her head and left in a hurry.
Sadie took a deep breath as she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes, relishing the brief respite.
She should have known it wouldn’t last for more than a moment. The peace was once again broken by the shrill ringing of her phone. She opened her eyes and glanced at the caller ID. When she saw Hank’s name on the screen, her heart sank.
Sadie took another deep breath before answering her phone. “Hello, Mr. Lawrence,” she said in a careful tone.
“Miss Hudson,” Hank said, his voice low and commanding. “I’ve seen the news going around the Internet. Naturally, I expect a reasonable explanation from you.”

Sadie told herself to remain calm. “Mr. Lawrence, please rest assured. Our contingency plan is already underway. You have my word that we will deliver on time.”
She had barely finished speaking when Hank interjected. “Miss Hudson! I’ll have you know that my wife has been looking forward to this party for months. It’s our tenth anniversary. You only have two days left. If anything goes wrong with this collaboration, I’m afraid there is nothing more I can do for you.”
“Like I said, Mr. Lawrence, I guarantee that the ‘Ten Year Promise’ will be worn by your wife in two days’ time.”
Instead of responding, Hank hung up on her.
Sadie’s hand trembled as she placed the phone back on her desk. She leaned back in her chair again and massaged her temples in sheer exhaustion.
Clearly, this wasn’t just about a missing pink diamond. Someone was pulling the strings behind the scenes to sabotage her.
The diamond hadn’t even been missing for a day, yet news of its disappearance was already spreading far and wide.
And then there was one thing she dreaded more than anything—the very real possibility that they had a mole in the studio.
Sadie’s mind was still racing with these dark thoughts when Pierre rushed back, his face as white as a sheet.

###Chapter 250:
“Miss Hudson,” he began in a shaky voice. “There are no pink diamonds of the same caliber in the local market…”
“What about abroad? Have you called our contacts?”
Pierre seemed to pale even more, swallowing a couple of times before he could get the words out. “I did reach out to them like you instructed, but… It’s been pouring since nightfall, and all flights have been canceled. There’s no way we could get a replacement here in time.”
Sadie let out a sardonic scoff. Whether it was the universe’s doing or that of some vicious mastermind, it seemed like everything was going against her.
Not that she would let this single setback stop her. She was going to weather this storm, no matter what.
“Call again,” she said. “Keep negotiating with them. Remind them that money is not a problem.”
“Yes, Miss Hudson.” Pierre stumbled out of the office, only to be accosted by his anxious colleagues.
“Pierre, what did Miss Hudson say?” a young designer asked timidly, her eyes wide with a mix of worry and hope.
“There are no available replacements for the pink diamond in the domestic market.”
The words hit like a thunderclap, and the group erupted into chaos. “What? Nothing at all?”
“What are we supposed to do now?”
“This is the studio’s biggest project. If we mess this up, what will become of us?”

An older designer, Patty Byrd, grabbed Pierre by the arm. “Think harder,” she said, sounding desperate. “Is there no other way? This studio—all the employees—we are depending on this project for our livelihood.” Patty’s eyes glistened with unshed tears. The others quickly chimed in, their voices devolving into a chaotic cacophony.
Pierre helplessly shook his head.
“This project is doomed. We’re all doomed!” someone cried out before crumbling to the floor in utter defeat.
“Is that true? Are we really doomed?”
Instead of answering, Pierre turned and walked away, his palms slick with sweat as he reached a quiet corner.
Meanwhile, elsewhere…noveldrama
“Something terrible has happened, Mr. Howe,” Alex’s assistant called out urgently as he barged into the CEO’s office.
Alex was seated behind his desk, his attention fixed on his computer.
He looked up from his screen, irritation flickering in his deep-set eyes. “What’s got you so worked up?”
“The Cardilla Pink Diamond from Miss Hudson’s studio… It’s gone missing! Everyone is talking about it online, and it’s already causing a huge backlash against the studio.” The words tumbled out of the assistant’s mouth in a rush, as if he was directly affected himself. Scowling, Alex shot to his feet. “And you’re absolutely sure that this information is accurate?”
“Yes, sir! The Internet is in an uproar. Netizens keep saying that Miss Hudson’s studio is facing its inevitable end…” The rest of the assistant’s words died in his throat as he studied the thunderous look on his boss’s face.
“Immediately get in touch with the Howe Group’s PR team, and tell them to pull out all the stops to support Sadie’s studio in swaying public opinion. We need to soften the blow of this scandal!” Alex commanded with urgency. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 251:
“Right away, Mr. Howe.” The assistant nodded briskly, turning to exit the room.
“Hold on a second!” Alex’s voice halted him in his tracks just as his hand touched the door handle. “Check with our business contacts to see if they can source another Cardilla Pink Diamond.”
The assistant froze, his eyes widening slightly. “Mr. Howe, are you suggesting—”noveldrama
“Just give it a shot,” Alex interjected firmly.
The assistant lingered at the door, uncertainty flickering in his eyes before he ventured, “Mr. Howe, if my memory serves me right, your mother has a necklace featuring a Cardilla Pink Diamond. It was the birthday present you gave her last year.”
Alex’s head snapped up, a flicker of realization crossing his face. How could he have overlooked that?
With the stakes high and no time to waste, his resolve hardened.
Alex rose from his chair, a determined glint in his eyes.
“Prepare the car. We’re heading to Howe Manor immediately.” Not daring to stall, the assistant quickly turned and rushed off to handle the arrangements.
Under the vast, star-speckled night sky, a sleek black Lincoln rolled to a graceful stop in front of the stately Howe Manor.
“Alex, you are home!”
As Alex entered the living room, a voice filled with joy greeted him.
It was his mother, Susannah Howe, perched elegantly on an antique mahogany sofa, her fingers absentmindedly caressing a bracelet. Her face was a portrait of warmth and kindness, lit by a gentle, welcoming smile.
She wore a deep purple silk dress that draped gracefully over her frame, a testament to her timeless elegance. Her hair was coiffed into a perfect bun at the nape of her neck, and her poise was the epitome of grace and refinement.
Mσr? υpdαt?s ín Gαlnσv?ls.cσm
Alex hastened to her side, bending slightly to bring himself closer to her. “Mom, why are you still up so late?” he asked, his tone laced with concern.
“I got word of your return and couldn’t possibly sleep until I saw you with my own eyes. You never take proper care of yourself, you know. How many times have I told you to meet a nice girl and start a family? But no, you never listen.”
Susannah chided her son playfully, though her eyes twinkled with unspoken affection.
With a mix of concern and motherly fuss, she inquired, “Have you had dinner? Should I have the kitchen whip up something for you, perhaps a late-night snack?”
With a faint smile, Alex shook his head ever so slightly. “No, thanks, Mom. Actually, there’s something I need to talk to you about.”
Susannah’s eyes captured Alex’s anxious demeanor. “What’s on your mind? Is everything alright?”
Alex paused, gathering his thoughts. “Mom, do you still have the Cardilla Pink Diamond necklace I gave you last birthday?”
Susannah’s eyebrows lifted in mild surprise before she nodded affirmatively. “Of course, I still have it. Why do you ask?”
“I have a friend who’s in a tight spot and desperately needs a Cardilla Pink Diamond…” Alex began, his voice trailing off as he searched for the right words.
Before he could get to the point, Susannah swiftly interrupted.
With a perceptive look, she watched Alex closely, the corners of her mouth curling with quiet amusement. “A friend, you say? This wouldn’t be a young woman, would it?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 252:
Alex’s face tensed subtly, a clear sign he was caught off guard. He shifted uncomfortably under Susannah’s scrutinizing gaze. “Mom, it’s not like that. She’s really just a friend, and she’s in trouble. What do you think I should do?”noveldrama
Years of knowing him inside out made it easy—Susannah instantly spotted the unease creeping into his normally composed demeanor. It appeared that Alex, typically detached around women, might indeed have a crush on someone.
She chuckled softly, reaching out to give his hand a reassuring squeeze. “Just look at you—so worried and tense.”
Turning around to address a maid who stood at the ready, Susannah commanded in a clear voice, “Go grab the Cardilla Pink Diamond necklace and bring it to me.”
With swift movements, the maid fetched the necklace. Under the gentle glow of the chandelier, the resplendent pink diamond emitted a brilliant sparkle.
Susannah took the necklace box herself and extended it towards Alex with a gentle flourish. “Here, take this,” she offered.
Alex’s fingers tightened around the box, his gaze deliberately avoiding Susannah’s inquisitive eyes.
“Alex, when do you plan to introduce this young lady to me?” Susannah inquired, her voice laced with a mix of curiosity and expectation.
Alex gripped the box even tighter, skillfully dodging her question. “Mom, it’s getting late. You should rest now.”
With those words, he turned and hurried out of Howe Manor.
From the doorway, Susannah watched her son’s departing silhouette, her head gently shaking in a mix of amusement and resignation, yet her eyes shimmered with undisguised affection. Alex remained distant, his demeanor reserved as ever.
The black Lincoln melted away into the shadowy embrace of the night once more.

In the quiet sanctuary of the back seat, Alex gently lifted the lid of the small, elegant box, revealing the glimmering pink diamond nestled within. His eyes lingered on its radiant hue.
“Take this necklace to the studio first thing tomorrow,” he said crisply to his assistant seated in the front.
“Understood, Mr. Howe.”
While the night deepened into inky blackness, the lights of Sadie’s studio blazed defiantly against the dark.
Inside her expansive office, Sadie sat alone, her silhouette sharply etched by a desk lamp.
Her desk was a chaotic spread of design drafts, each a testament to her relentless passion and meticulous craftsmanship.
Prominently among the clutter lay a sketch of an exquisite necklace, the crown jewel of her “Ten Year Promise” collection and undoubtedly the most crucial.
Yet, the absence of the Cardilla Pink Diamond left a gaping void in her plans. Absolutely not! She couldn’t put all her hope in that one diamond—there had to be another option.
With the design draft in hand, determination burned in Sadie’s eyes. If the Cardilla Pink Diamond was out of reach, she’d carve out another way forward.
Sadie had spent the entire night awake. Her eyes were red and sore, giving her a worn-out look, yet her gaze retained a piercing quality. The light aroma of coffee hung in the air. In the stillness of the room, only the gentle rustling of design papers could be heard.

###Chapter 253:
Suddenly, a knock disrupted the silence.
“Come in,” Sadie called out, her voice rough from exhaustion. As the door swung open, Pierre entered, cradling an elegant velvet box in his hands.
“Miss Hudson, this was sent over by Mr. Howe,” Pierre said, presenting the box with formality.
Surprise flickered across Sadie’s face as she accepted the box, her expression turning to one of puzzlement as she lifted the lid.
Nestled inside was a breathtaking diamond necklace, featuring a large Cardilla pink diamond as its stunning centerpiece.
Sadie’s heart jolted, and for a moment, she froze.
It was the very pink diamond she had been desperately seeking throughout the city, missing from her latest design draft. How had Alex found one?
Without hesitation, Sadie blurted out, “Where did this come from?”
Pierre paused momentarily before responding, “This belonged to Mr. Howe’s mother. He presented it to her on her birthday last year.”
In an instant, Sadie’s face took on a complex expression. Alex had taken his mother’s necklace… and given it to her? Her grip on the box tightened, her knuckles whitening.
After a lengthy silence, she said, “Please extend my gratitude to Mr. Howe.”
With a nod, Pierre exited the studio.
Holding the necklace, Sadie let out a deep sigh. She realized that Alex was attempting to support her through this challenging time. With deliberate care, Sadie nestled the necklace back into its box, knowing it wasn’t hers to keep.
The significance of the piece was too great—originally a heartfelt gift from Alex to his mother; it wasn’t something she could rightfully accept.
Your favorite stories gαlnσvs?com
She had already developed a new solution that would help her navigate her current difficulties.
The reason she hadn’t rejected the gift immediately was to prevent any additional stress for Alex.
Once the present issue was resolved, she planned to return the necklace.
Soon after, a soft knock interrupted her thoughts again.
Pierre stepped back into the room, his face etched with regret.
“No change at the airport, Miss Hudson. All flights remain delayed.”
Gently shaking her head, Sadie let her dark hair fall forward, shading one side of her pale face.
“There’s no need for further contact,” Sadie said firmly.
Pierre hesitated, seeming on the verge of speaking, then reconsidered.
“Tell the team to take a two-day break. They need some rest,” Sadie instructed.
“A two-day break?” Pierre responded, his surprise evident.
Could they afford to pause everything during such a critical time?noveldrama
With determination in her voice, Sadie replied, “Yes, just go ahead and arrange it.”
Despite his worries, Pierre gave a concerned look, then nodded and exited.
He proceeded to the common area, where employees were gathered, discussing the situation around the missing diamond under a cloud of tension. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 254:
“Everyone,” said Pierre, his voice carrying a hint of dryness, “Miss Hudson has granted us two days off.”
The moment Pierre announced the time off, murmurs swept through the studio.
“Two days off? Right now?” someone questioned incredulously.
“Does this mean the studio is on the brink?” another pondered aloud.
“Considering the magnitude of our problems, resolution seems impossible,” a voice added somberly.
Quiet whispers spread among the employees, intensifying the already somber mood.noveldrama
With a sense of resignation, they gathered their belongings and departed with heavy steps.
Before long, Sadie was left alone in the studio.
Meanwhile, Kyla was seated near a floor-to-ceiling window, idly swirling her wine glass.
As she sipped her wine, a sardonic smile played across her lips. “Sadie, do you genuinely believe you can salvage this situation?” Kyla mused darkly. “I’m curious to see how you plan to complete the ‘Ten Year Promise’ design without the Cardilla Pink Diamond.”
Placing her glass aside, Kyla walked to the desk and picked up a red velvet box.
Upon opening it, she saw a three-carat pink diamond nestled inside.
The following day.
Bright light from the sparkling crystal chandelier enveloped the Lawrence Group’s banquet hall.
? ?  .
Distinguished guests from various sectors converged to celebrate the 10th wedding anniversary of the Lawrence Group’s founders. Clad in a wine-red gown that accentuated her slim figure, Kyla was a vision of radiance and allure.
Holding a champagne glass elegantly, she kept a vigilant watch on the hall’s entrance, seemingly anticipating someone’s arrival.
Catching sight of Alex in the crowd, she began to navigate her way toward him.
Alex, dressed in a sleek black suit, exuded an air of even greater composure and restraint.
“Mr. Howe, have you completely dismissed the idea of partnering with me? We both stand to benefit,” Kyla said.
Alex’s response was a subtle furrow of his brow, his eyes meeting Kyla’s with a cold detachment.
“There’s no need for that,” he replied curtly, not hesitating before he turned to walk away.
As Alex departed, Kyla’s grip on her champagne flute grew tighter, her eyes following his every step.
Sadie arrived late.
As she entered the banquet hall, every head turned toward her. Clad in a stunning white gown that elegantly emphasized her silhouette, Sadie drew attention effortlessly.
Kyla, swirling her champagne, approached with a sneer.
“So, the great designer has finally decided to grace us with her presence.”
As Sadie faced Kyla with a composed expression, her eyes showed no sign of distress. “Miss Wade, do you need something from me?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 255:
Kyla’s sneer deepened as she said, “Why, can’t I say hello without an agenda?” She paused, her tone sharp. “I’m curious, though. How do you plan to deliver the ‘Ten Year Promise’ to your client without the Cardilla Pink Diamond? Can you afford to pay the penalty fee?”
A hush fell over the banquet hall as all eyes shifted to Sadie, their faces etched with curiosity.
Rumors about her predicament had already spread, and contrary to expectations, Sadie had appeared, surprising everyone.
Despite Kyla’s attempt to corner her, Sadie maintained her composure. She had prepared for this moment, fully aware of Kyla’s intentions to embarrass her, and she was determined not to falter.
Sadie offered a faint smile. “Miss Wade, you appear overly interested in my business. But you don’t have to concern yourself with the penalty fee and the ‘Ten Year Promise.'”
Her eyes moved across the gathering, finally settling on Kyla’s glass. “Miss Wade, perhaps you should concern yourself with the glass in your hand more. Don’t drop it.”
A cold seemed to creep into Kyla’s heart, unsettling her unexpectedly. The composed and assured look in Sadie’s eyes stirred an uneasy feeling in her, leaving her puzzled as to why Sadie appeared so confident.
“Really? Sadie, it’s you who ought to be concerned.”
Kyla lifted her chin, wearing a smirk filled with mockery.
“I shall see,” Sadie said, her tone even and unruffled.
Just then, Alex moved to stand by Sadie, his presence like a shield from the curious stares around them. His look of concern was directed toward her.
Your next story is at gα?ησν?s?com
The hall immediately filled with whispered speculations.
“What is going on between Alex and Sadie?”
“Do they have a relationship?”
The crowd was abuzz with various theories and conjectures.
Kyla’s features subtly altered in response.
At that moment, the doors to the banquet hall were opened again.
Hand in hand, Hank and Leanna made their appearance.
Adorned in a sapphire blue gown, Leanna was decked with matching sapphire accessories—necklace, earrings, and a ring. Her jewels sparkled under the bright lights, drawing the gaze of every attendee. Silence enveloped the hall.
The dazzling jewels adorning Leanna captured everyone’s gaze, leaving the crowd speechless with admiration.noveldrama
Kyla stood motionless. She had assumed Sadie would present the “Ten Year Promise” design with a Cardilla Pink Diamond. She hadn’t anticipated this twist.
A chill of apprehension crept over her.
All eyes in the hall shifted among Sadie, Alex, and Leanna, filled with bewilderment and curiosity.
Breaking the hushed atmosphere, Kyla gestured sharply towards the sapphire necklace on Leanna’s neck and demanded, “Wasn’t this supposed to be the Cardilla Pink Diamond? What’s happening here? Is Miss Hudson pulling a fast one on Mrs. Lawrence?”
Kyla was stunned. She had meticulously plotted Sadie’s downfall, targeting her career and public standing.
However, things had not gone according to plan—how could she reconcile with this turn of events? 
.
.
.
###Chapter 256:
With a composed look, Sadie’s eyes met Kyla’s, her lips curving into a knowing grin. “Miss Wade, this isn’t your fault.”
This response caught Kyla off guard; she had not anticipated such a remark from Sadie.
“Everyone has their flaws. It seems you’re just missing a little common sense,” Sadie continued, her tone light yet piercing.noveldrama
Fury marred Kyla’s visage, her expression souring instantly. The sting of Sadie’s words hit sharply.
Sadie’s attention casually shifted to the brilliant sapphire necklace around Leanna’s neck, her smile subtly spreading.
“This exquisite sapphire represents eternal love, a perfect reflection of Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence’s enduring commitment to each other.” Leanna caressed the necklace, her expression aglow with joy. “Sadie has impeccable taste; this necklace is truly wonderful.”
The color drained from Kyla’s face, her cheeks flushing with a heat akin to a stinging slap. Her hands balled into fists, her nails pressing into her palms.
Overwhelmed, she abruptly turned and hurried away from the gathering.
Sadie’s gaze followed Kyla’s hasty departure, her face a portrait of calm composure.
Alex’s eyes dropped, reflecting his thoughts. He had thought he had helped Sadie, but now it seemed… she didn’t need his help.
Hank took the moment to express his gratitude publicly. “I want to extend a special thanks to Miss Hudson. Her studio and she have proven themselves exceptional. It is with great pleasure that I announce the next jewelry exhibition for the Lawrence Group will be exclusively managed by Miss Hudson and her team.”
Hank’s commanding voice reverberated across the vast banquet hall. A brief silence fell over the crowd before it burst into more lively discussions than before.
Stay tuned for more glnoνes.c?m
The management of the upcoming jewelry exhibition for the Lawrence Group was such a prestigious opportunity that it was fiercely contested.
And yet, Hank had handed it to Sadie without a second thought. Sadie was also surprised by such a significant gesture of trust. She hadn’t seen it coming.
The banquet hall buzzed with the clinking of glasses.
A middle-aged man sporting a meticulously groomed hairstyle and dressed in a sharp deep blue suit approached Sadie with a beaming smile, wine glass in hand.
“Miss Hudson, so much praise has been sung about your work! Having seen you now, I’m sure the praise was well-founded!”
Sadie, with a polite nod, raised her glass to meet his in a delicate toast. “Thank you, Mr. Hammond. It’s a pleasure, and I hope our paths continue to cross,” she said with modesty, her smile subtle but genuine.
Jonathan Hammond admired Sadie, his eyes reflecting a deep respect as they landed on her gracefully slender neck.
“Miss Hudson, you are quite remarkable,” he said, pausing thoughtfully before cautiously asking, “May I inquire if you are married?”
Sadie was taken aback for a moment but soon responded with a smile and a shake of her head. She had long moved on from her relationship with Noah.
“Not yet,” she responded simply. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 257:
Joy sparkled in Jonathan’s eyes, and his grin widened.
“That’s fantastic!” he exclaimed. “My son is both talented and handsome, and together, you’d make an excellent pair! What do you say to…”
Before he could continue, a sudden cold interrupted him.
Alex appeared silently beside Sadie, his imposing presence obstructing Jonathan’s line of sight.
A subtle frost seemed to glaze Alex’s striking features, his gaze intensely fixed on Jonathan.
The scene struck Sadie as rather humorous.
Looking kindly at Jonathan, she spoke. “I appreciate your suggestion, but I prefer to follow my own heart when it comes to these matters.”
Feeling the tension, Jonathan chuckled nervously and, taking the hint, walked away swiftly.
With Jonathan gone, Sadie’s initial shock subsided.
A sharp gleam appeared in her eyes, and she murmured with a hint of resolve, “Now, it’s time to clean house.”
Alex, by her side, looked on with concern. He leaned in and murmured, “Do you need help with that?”
Turning to face him, Sadie offered a reassuring smile. “Thank you, but I can handle it on my own.”
Meanwhile, tucked away in a quiet corner of the banquet hall, Pierre clutched his phone, his hands slick with cold sweat, his complexion ashen, and his lips quivering. He struggled to muster the courage to take the call.
The relentless ringing of the phone echoed ominously, pushing him to act.
? ?  .
With a tight grip on his resolve, he finally pressed the answer button.noveldrama
“What’s going on?! Why didn’t you report the change in the design draft immediately?!” Kyla’s voice pierced through from the other end, sharp and filled with barely contained fury, as if ready to burst through the phone.
Startled, Pierre nearly let the phone slip from his grasp.
Struggling for composure, he said, “Miss Wade, Miss Hudson gave the whole studio two days off… I’ve only just returned to work today… I assumed she was out of alternatives… It never crossed my mind… It never crossed my mind that she would choose a sapphire over the pink diamond…”
“Idiot, we’ve been ensnared in her scheme!”
Before Pierre had a chance to speak, his phone was swiftly taken from him.
Turning in alarm, Pierre saw Sadie standing silently behind him, her presence casting a shiver through him.
As the hall’s din seemed to recede, Pierre’s pounding heart seemed to be the only sound remaining.
With assured calm, Sadie brought the phone to her ear and said firmly, “Kyla, I recommend you turn yourself in willingly. If not, things will get messy for you, and a peaceful solution will be unreachable.” Her words carried a forceful authority.
Sadie quickly ended the call and nonchalantly threw the phone back to Pierre.
Pierre caught the phone awkwardly, his face a mask of fright.
“Mi… Miss Hudson…” Pierre stammered, his forehead drenched in sweat that soon soaked his collar. His trembling lips tried to form a plea for mercy, yet he was at a loss for where to start. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 258:
Sadie gazed down at him with a look of disdain.
“People often say that the deepest betrayals are those committed by the ones we trust the most.”
As she spoke, Pierre’s complexion turned a shade paler. He found himself unable to meet her eyes, his gaze darting about restlessly. “There are only two keys to the safe that housed the Cardilla Pink Diamond; one is with me, and the other with you. Could there be any explanation other than you having taken it?”
At this revelation, despair washed over Pierre; he had been completely unaware of that fact.
Without giving him a chance to recover, Sadie continued, “I’ve had a detective check your financial activities. Just before the pink diamond went missing, your account showed several mysterious transactions.” Sadie remained composed. She had predicted such a scenario, though she hadn’t expected Pierre to be involved.
At that moment, two police officers in uniform entered the banquet hall and made their way straight toward her.
Pierre’s eyes grew wide with alarm as he looked at Sadie, his voice trembling. “Did you call the police on me?”
Sadie offered no reply, merely regarding him with a look that lacked any semblance of sympathy.
Upon reaching Sadie, the officers flashed their badges and one addressed her. “Miss Hudson, we’re here about a theft report.”
“Yes,” Sadie responded with tranquility. “He’s the perpetrator.”
The officers didn’t hesitate, swiftly handcuffing Pierre.
As they escorted him away, Pierre shouted loudly, “I’m innocent! This is a setup!”noveldrama
His ions and attempts to resist were futile, easily subdued as he was taken out of the room.
After the commotion settled, Sadie gracefully returned to the mingling crowd, her demeanor calm and undisturbed. The sound of clinking glasses and ongoing conversations filled the air around her.
Sadie lingered by the champagne tower, holding a glass of champagne without taking a sip.
Leanna moved through the crowd to approach her.
“Sadie, why are you standing here all by yourself? I’ve been searching for you everywhere,” Leanna said, her voice warm and concerned.
Looking up, Sadie managed a strained smile. “I’ve just been dealing with some personal issues. I didn’t mean to cause you concern.”
Leanna touched Sadie’s hand reassuringly. “I’m aware of the challenges you’ve faced lately.”
Sadie lowered her gaze, choosing to remain silent.
With a sigh, Leanna reached into her stylish handbag and retrieved a business card, handing it to Sadie.
“An old friend of mine just returned from overseas. She works with a company even more renowned than the Lawrence Group. It might be a good move for you to secure a deal with them if you’re looking to make a significant impact.”
Sadie took the card from Leanna.
With a grave expression, Leanna continued, “Sadie, your talent is truly exceptional. All you need is the right opportunity. Remember, chances like this are rare—make sure you seize it.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 259:
Sadie nodded. “Thank you, Mrs. Lawrence. I will give it some serious thought.”
Relief washed over Leanna, her eyes softening with a gentle smile. “Don’t linger here on your own. Go have some fun.”
As Sadie held the card, she admired the elegant script that read, “Eva Shaw, Stonemont Estate.”
Renowned for its exclusivity, Stonemont Estate sat on the city’s outskirts, and Eva Shaw was known worldwide as a savvy investor.
Sadie was familiar with her impressive reputation.
She carefully placed the card in her pocket.
In stark contrast, the mood in Kyla’s apartment was tense. She paced back and forth, frustration evident in her every movement.
The idea of turning herself in felt utterly ridiculous to her. Her slender fingers gripped the phone tightly, her manicured nails nearly digging into her flesh.
The silence was shattered by a sudden knock.
Kyla halted, steadying herself to project calmness.
Approaching the door, she glanced through the peephole and spotted two police officers. Her heart dropped, a wave of cold dread washing over her.noveldrama
With a forced smile, she swung the door open. “Officers, how can I assist you today?”
“Miss Wade, we need to discuss a matter with you. Your cooperation would be appreciated,” said one officer, his voice carrying a blend of seriousness and formality.
Kyla’s smile wavered as she stepped aside, welcoming them into her home. “Absolutely. Please, come inside.”
As the officers stepped inside, Kyla closed the door, battling the surge of panic within. She elegantly proceeded to the living room and gestured towards the sofa, inviting the officers to sit.
New content uploaded g?lnσvls?c?m
“How may I be of assistance, officers?”
One officer presented his badge, holding it steadily before her. “We’ve received allegations of your involvement in the theft of a Cardilla Pink Diamond. We require your assistance with the ongoing investigation.”
Kyla’s polite smile solidified into a mask of shock. Her eyes widened as she looked at him incredulously. “Theft? That’s utterly ridiculous! Surely, there’s been some error!”
“Miss Wade, we ask for your cooperation as we proceed with our inquiries,” the officer said firmly, allowing no room for debate.
Kyla clenched her fists, knowing that resisting would be futile at this point.
“I agree to cooperate.”
The officers set about meticulously searching her apartment, rifling through each nook and cranny, filling the space with a tense and oppressive air.
The sound of the fire crackling in the fireplace filled the silent, darkening night.
“Miss Wade, what is this?” asked one of the officers, pulling a black velvet box from the safe in Kyla’s bedroom.
Kyla froze in place.
As the officer lifted the lid of the box, a sparkling pink diamond was revealed, resting silently within.
It was indeed the lost Cardilla Pink Diamond!

###Chapter 260:
Kyla’s complexion turned ashen; her lips quivered, yet no words came out.
“Miss Wade, would you like to explain this?” the officer asked as he shut the box.
Kyla inhaled deeply, trying to compose herself. “May I make a phone call?”
After a brief pause, the officer nodded. “You may.”
With her fingers quivering, Kyla grasped her phone, her thoughts whirling.
She considered calling Noah but stopped herself abruptly.
Noah was currently overseas on business. Telling him what she had done might only complicate matters further. She decided it was best not to inform him.
She had to find someone who could get her out of this immediately.
Eventually, she opted to call Isabel.
As the call went through, Isabel’s soothing voice filled the line. “Kyla, it’s quite late. Is everything okay?”noveldrama
Tears choked Kyla’s voice as she replied, “Isabel…” She struggled to speak through her sobs. “I… I’m in a real mess…”
Isabel’s tone shifted to concern immediately. “Tell me what’s happened? What’s wrong?”
Between uncontrollable sobs, Kyla spoke, painting herself as an unwitting victim of Sadie’s scheming.
“Sadie orchestrated this against me…” Her story was far from the truth and overly dramatized.
“Really? She did that to you?” Outrage colored Isabel’s response. “Hang tight, Kyla. I’m on my way to help. Where are you right now?” Kyla whispered her address, then let out a shaky whimper. “Isabel, I’m really scared…”
“Stay calm, Kyla. I’m on my way!”

At that moment, the two police officers exchanged looks. One stepped forward, saying, “Miss Wade, please follow us.”
Standing, Kyla responded simply, “Alright.”
Her eyes burned with a raw, undisguised malice.
Kyla silently vowed to herself, determined to never let Sadie live a peaceful life.
Across town, Sadie had just arrived back at her home.
The living room was enveloped in silence, broken only by the gentle, rhythmic sound of Averi’s breathing.
Tucked on the sofa, Averi lay wrapped in a cozy blanket, deeply asleep. Moving softly across the room, Sadie carefully adjusted the blanket to ensure Averi stayed warm.
Averi’s calm expression eased some of Sadie’s tension.
She then walked to the window and drew back the curtains to look out at the city lights twinkling in the night, her thoughts swirling. Pulling out her phone, Sadie looked at the calls she had tried to make to Noah.
She had intended to finalize their divorce at court soon, but Noah hadn’t responded to any of her attempts to reach him.
She wondered, where could Noah be? Why wasn’t he picking up?
A sinking feeling took hold of Sadie, accompanied by a rush of anxiety.
Pausing briefly, she resolved to call Samuel instead.
After two rings, the call connected.

###Chapter 261:
“Hello, Mr. Ford, where’s Noah?” Sadie inquired.
“Miss Hudson, Mr. Wall is currently overseas on business and won’t return for some time. Should you have an urgent matter, it will need to wait until his return,” Samuel replied, his tone unyielding and detached.
Sadie stood motionless, her thoughts ceasing entirely.
Noah was on a business trip abroad? Not returning anytime soon? She started to mention the divorce, “But—” However, Samuel disconnected the call before she could finish.
With a sense of defeat, Sadie threw her phone onto the table.
“Damn this Noah!”
As night enveloped Zupren, a foreign country, Noah was framed against a floor-to-ceiling window, a cigarette dangling from his fingers. The silence was broken by the sharp ring of his phone.
Turning his attention, Noah picked up the phone and saw the caller ID flash—”Mother.”
Noah clicked the answer button, responding with a detached, “Mom.”
“Noah.” Isabel’s voice rang with urgency. “Kyla’s in trouble!”
“What’s going on with her?” Noah asked, his eyebrows knitting together.
Although a sense of impatience crept up on him, he kept listening.
Isabel delivered a dramatized account of Kyla’s predicament, her words heavy with emotion and punctuated by accusations against Sadie and sympathy for Kyla.
“They’ve arrested Kyla, claiming she stole a pink diamond. That can’t be right. I’m sure it’s Sadie setting her up! Noah, you need to do something,” Isabel said, her voice cracking with emotion, pushing Noah’s frustration higher.
A pink diamond?

Noah extinguished his cigarette.
“I’ll take care of it,” he said.
“Are you really going to help Kyla? Noah, she—” Isabel began, but Noah interrupted her.
“I need to go, Mom. Ending the call now.” He promptly disconnected the call.
His fingers lightly tapped the screen as he searched for Samuel’s contact.
“Samuel, get me on the next flight home.”
There was a brief pause, as if Samuel was caught off guard. “But Mr. Wall, you mentioned—”
“Just book it,” Noah interjected sharply, his voice firm.
Samuel hesitated no further, responding quickly, “Understood, Mr. Wall.”
The interrogation room was stifling, the air thick with tension that weighed heavily on Kyla’s shoulders.
Her face was pale, her hands clasped tightly in her lap.
Why hadn’t Isabel arrived yet?
Just as Kyla’s anxiety peaked, the door swung open.
“Kyla!” Isabel’s voice trembled as she quickly closed the distance, enveloping Kyla in a reassuring embrace.
“It’s alright. I’m here now.”
Kyla leaned into Isabel, her tears flowing silently. She bit her lip to stifle a sob. noveldrama

###Chapter 262:
Isabel rubbed Kyla’s back gently, her voice calm and soothing as she said, “Don’t worry. It’s over. I’ve posted your bail; we’re going home.”
As Kyla stepped out into the cool night, the fresh air seemed to help clear her mind a bit.
Isabel’s eyes, red from crying, landed on her with concern. “Kyla, you’ve endured so much. I’ve told Noah; he’ll be back soon.”
A pang of worry shot through Kyla. She hadn’t expected Isabel to involve Noah.
This was troubling. Ever since Sadie’s return, Noah had subtly shown signs of favoring her. If he delved into this incident…
Kyla feared she might completely lose her place in his heart.
She mustered a weak smile, attempting to appear nonchalant. “Isabel, I’m okay, really. Maybe we shouldn’t bother Noah. I’d rather not blow this out of proportion.”
Isabel sighed deeply, her frustration evident. “You silly girl, why do you insist on being so selfless? After what that woman has done, and you’re still concerned about overreacting? Noah deserves to know her true nature!”
Kyla’s gaze flickered, betraying her internal conflict. “Isabel, I just… don’t want Noah to worry over me.”
Seeing Kyla’s soft-heartedness made Isabel’s heart clench.
She pulled Kyla into a tight embrace, her own anger simmering.
Kyla was too selfless, always considering others’ benefits, even now. Sadie, on the other hand, was ruthless, willing to do whatever it took to get her way.
When Isabel took Kyla back to Wall Manor, the night had deepened into a quiet stillness.
Kyla sat opposite Isabel, cradling a cup of hot tea, the warmth seeping into her chilled hands.

“Kyla, I’ve heard about your dismissal. Don’t blame Noah. He tends to make quick decisions in business,” Isabel sighed gently.
Kyla felt a tightness in her chest, her fingers curling into her palms reflexively.
“Kyla, I’ve arranged for you to start a new role. Tomorrow, you’ll take over a branch office.”
“Take over?” Kyla looked up sharply, a mix of surprise and excitement in her eyes.
“Yes,” Isabel affirmed with a nod.
“You and Noah will eventually get married. It’s time you learned to be his support, to effectively manage the branch.”
Kyla’s joy was palpable. “Thank you, Isabel. I can’t thank you enough…”noveldrama
Leading a branch office had been her longstanding aspiration.
“Kyla, just do your best. I have every confidence in you. Remember, if it hadn’t been for your intervention, those frauds would have tricked me!”
Isabel reflected on the past with a sigh.
Kyla’s eyes briefly showed a flicker of guilt, but she quickly masked it with a smile. “Isabel, let’s not dwell on the past. I just did what I should do.”
The next morning, Kyla entered the Wall Group branch office wearing a perfectly tailored champagne-colored suit.
“Miss Wade, good morning!”
The receptionist greeted her with clear respect. 
.

###Chapter 263:
Kyla nodded slightly, enjoying the spotlight.
As she moved through the office, each employee she passed acknowledged her with a nod or a bow, their voices carrying a tone of respect.
“Good morning, Miss Wade!”noveldrama
“Hello, Miss Wade!”
“Welcome, Miss Wade!”
The chorus of greetings bolstered Kyla’s self-esteem, and with each step, her satisfaction grew.
It was evident that Isabel’s endorsement had circulated through the office.
With her posture straightened, Kyla walked with increased confidence. Upon reaching the marketing department, she found the spacious and bright office buzzing with activity.
“Miss Wade!” The marketing department manager greeted her with considerable respect. “What brings you here today?”
“I’m just taking a look around.” Kyla’s response was cool, her posture composed.
Her eyes swept across the office, pausing on a document on one of the desks. “What’s this?”
The marketing department manager quickly retrieved the document and presented it to Kyla with both hands.
“This is the partnership proposal we’ve been working on with Stonemont Estate. However…” He paused, seeming hesitant.
“However, what?” Kyla pressed, her tone laced with impatience.
“Ms. Shaw has declined our proposals repeatedly. Despite our best efforts, we’ve been unable to secure her agreement,” the manager explained carefully.
Your favorite updates g?lnσν?ls?com
Kyla thumbed through the document, her expression tightening.
Stonemont Estate was a renowned, high-end resort in the suburbs. Landing a partnership with them would be a significant win for the branch.
“I believe Mr. Wall might know Ms. Shaw personally…” the manager hinted tentatively. “Perhaps he could intervene…?” A spark of opportunity lit up Kyla’s eyes.
That was indeed a promising angle.
She masked her eagerness with a measured smile and said, “Leave this to me.”
Relief washed over the manager. “It’s all yours, Miss Wade! Thank you!” A thrill of anticipation surged through Kyla.
This was her chance to distinguish herself before Noah and solidify her standing within the company.
Within a secluded members-only club, a circle of elegantly attired socialites were engaged in light chatter and laughter. Susannah stood among them, draped in a dark green gown that highlighted her elegant and regal air. Holding a champagne flute, she sipped lightly, her politeness masking a distracted mind.
“Have you heard the latest rumor? A new jewelry design studio is causing quite a stir. It’s led by a designer named Sadie Hudson. I’ve heard her pieces are truly remarkable!” a woman in a red gown whispered excitedly.
“Sadie? Wasn’t she the one who designed jewelry for the Lawrence Group but lost that Cardilla Pink Diamond?” inquired another, her voice tinged with contempt.
“Yes, that’s the one! Imagine the audacity of substituting it with a sapphire!” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 264:
“Indeed! And though the sapphire is also valuable, its worth doesn’t even come close to the Cardilla Pink Diamond’s!”
The group around them nodded their heads in agreement. While Susannah had only been half-listening, the mention of the “Cardilla Pink Diamond” made her brows furrow in concern. She recalled that Alex had approached her, requesting a necklace, claiming it was for a special friend. A chill of apprehension washed over her.
She gently set her champagne glass down and quietly excused herself from the gathering, exiting the banquet hall. Her mind was a whirlwind of confusion and concern. Without delay, she dialed her team, directing them to investigate the issues surrounding Sadie and the Cardilla Pink Diamond. The response arrived swiftly.
“Mrs. Howe, our investigation confirms that Sadie Hudson was indeed involved in a design project for the Lawrence Group. Prior to its completion, the Cardilla Pink Diamond disappeared, and she substituted it with a sapphire. We also found that during that period, Mr. Howe’s assistant made a visit to Sadie’s studio, apparently to deliver an item.”
Hearing this, Susannah felt a jolt of shock. Could it be possible that Alex’s ‘important friend’ was this very Sadie? And… Hudson?
She recognized the surname, but her recollection was vague, blurred by the years.noveldrama
“Continue the investigation! I need a complete background on this woman,” she commanded.
Sadie returned to her apartment after a tough day. She walked over to Averi and affectionately tousled his soft hair.
“Averi, would you like to visit Great-Grandma today?” she suggested gently.
Discover new books gα?ησνs?com
Averi nodded in agreement, his little hand gripping Sadie’s shirt firmly. Taking his hand, Sadie guided him to the exit. As she opened the door to leave, she unexpectedly encountered a poised and elegant woman.
Taken aback, Sadie paused briefly and instinctively retreated a step.
Susannah observed the child clasping Sadie’s hand. Her face registered mixed emotions, and after a lengthy silence, she exhaled softly. “You are Sadie, aren’t you?”
With a puzzled expression, Sadie acknowledged politely. “Yes, that’s me. And you are?”
“I’m Alex’s mother,” Susannah replied.
This revelation made Sadie blink in astonishment.
Alex’s mother? What could have brought her here?
Susannah assessed Sadie carefully, pondering her next words. Her gaze briefly shifted to Averi, then back to Sadie. “Might we talk more privately downstairs in the cafe? It’s best not to have this discussion in front of the child.”
Initially hesitant, Sadie soon agreed with a nod.
“Please go ahead, Mrs. Howe. I’ll take a moment to talk to my child and join you,” she responded softly.
With a slight nod, Susannah turned and departed.
As Susannah walked away, Sadie felt a stir of unease. She went back to her room and pulled out a jewelry box from a drawer—the very one delivered by Alex’s assistant. After asking Averi to stay put and play quietly, she took the box and made her way to the cafe.
There, Susannah was seated by the window, maintaining an elegant posture as she sipped her coffee, her attention seemingly captivated by the scene outside. 
.

###Chapter 265:
Sadie joined her, taking the opposite chair.
“Can I get you a drink?” Susannah inquired, shifting her focus to Sadie.
“Just a glass of water. Thanks,” Sadie answered.
Susannah signaled for the waiter and ordered water for Sadie.
After the waiter departed, silence briefly enveloped the table.
Susannah retrieved a check from her finely crafted leather handbag and placed it smoothly before Sadie. The paper bore a prominent seal and an elegant signature, yet the amount remained unfilled.
“Miss Hudson, state your price.”
Sadie’s gaze lingered on the check, uncertainty flickering in her eyes.
“Mrs. Howe, what is this about?”
Susannah set her coffee spoon down with a sharp clatter, the sound slicing through the hushed atmosphere of the cafe.
“I will not allow a descendant of the Howe family to live outside the family.”
Sadie blinked, confusion deepening.
Susannah continued, “I’m aware of your circumstances. The Hudson name… no longer holds weight. You’re a young mother, raising a child alone—life can’t be easy. This check guarantees that you will never struggle again. Think carefully, Miss Hudson. This is the wisest decision for both you and Averi.”
A realization dawned on Sadie. Susannah had misunderstood things.
“Mrs. Howe, you can relax. I don’t have any improper intentions like you think. Regarding Averi’s parentage… I believe there’s been a misunderstanding.”
Susannah stiffened, clearly unprepared for this response. Her expression darkened.

“What do you mean by this? My investigators were thorough. Averi is yours and Alex’s, born in Zupren three years ago.”
The discovery had left Susannah shocked. Beyond that, her sources uncovered that Sadie had previously admitted—on multiple occasions—that Averi was Alex’s child. And now, she was refuting it? Was she angling for more than money?
Sadie exhaled slowly. It was time to clear things up.
Sliding the velvet box across the table, she said, “Alex’s assistant gave me this. I believe it should now be returned to its rightful owner. As for Alex and me, we were never more than friends. He’s helped me before, but nothing beyond that.”noveldrama
Sadie lowered her gaze, her thick lashes veiling the turmoil in her eyes. The past wasn’t something she wished to revisit.
“And Averi… he is not Alex’s son. Due to personal matters, I once asked him to pretend to be Averi’s father. I apologize for the confusion.”
Susannah’s eyes narrowed, skepticism evident. She studied Sadie intently, searching for any trace of deception. The woman before her appeared delicate, yet there was an underlying resilience in her stance.
After a moment, Sadie spoke again. “If you still doubt me, I’m willing to have my son take a DNA test to put this matter to rest.”
With that, she grabbed her purse, rose from her seat, and left without another word.
Susannah watched her retreat, lost in thought. She couldn’t shake the feeling that things might not be as simple as they seemed.

###Chapter 266:
Her attention drifted to the jewelry box Sadie had returned. She reached for it and flipped it open. Inside, the pink diamond necklace lay untouched.
Anyone else in Sadie’s position would have accepted such an offer without hesitation. But she didn’t. That, at the very least, was bold.
Aside from her origins, the girl seemed… decent.
Outside the cafe, Sadie inhaled deeply, steadying herself. She had done her part—whether Susannah believed her was another matter.
Back at Howe Manor, Susannah handed off her shawl to a waiting servant. Pressing her fingers to her temples, she exhaled, weariness seeping into her posture.
“Welcome back, Mrs. Howe,” the butler said respectfully, stepping forward.
“Yeah,” Susannah responded, making her way to the sofa.
Before she could settle in, hurried footsteps echoed from outside. Alex strode in, concern written all over his face.
“Mom, I heard you met with Sadie?”
Susannah glanced up, amusement flickering in her eyes. “Why do you look so troubled?”
Alex stopped before her, his voice firm. “What did you say to her? Is she alright?”noveldrama
Susannah lifted the cup a servant had just placed before her, blowing lightly over the surface before taking a measured sip.
“Don’t be so dramatic. I simply had a conversation with her.”
Alex didn’t look convinced, his jaw tightening. “Just a conversation? You didn’t pressure her to do anything, did you?”

Setting the cup down, Susannah studied her son. “You seem quite invested in this woman, Alex.”
Alex fell silent for a moment before finally speaking. “She’s a good person. She doesn’t deserve to be treated unfairly.”
“Alex, I know you have a compassionate heart, but not everything is as straightforward as you think,” Susannah said calmly.
Alex met her gaze. “What are you trying to say?”
Susannah’s gaze locked onto Alex, her eyes narrowing as she studied him. “Have you fallen for Sadie?” she asked, her voice cutting through the air.
Alex hesitated, his jaw tightening as he struggled to find the right words. After a moment, he finally spoke. “I have, Mom.”
Susannah’s perfectly sculpted brows furrowed, and despite the flawless makeup that adorned her face, it couldn’t conceal the anger brewing beneath. “This is unbelievable!” she snapped. “A single mother with a child? And you’ve fallen for her? Have you lost sight of your responsibilities as the heir of this family?”
Alex took a deep breath, his voice steady but pleading. “Mom, Sadie is strong, compassionate, and worthy of happiness. Why can’t you accept that?”
Susannah’s eyes narrowed in disbelief. “So you really think she’s someone worth considering?” Her voice dripped with disdain. “No matter how amazing she is, she’s a single mom. She made choices that ruined her reputation; how could you even think she can be a part of our family?”
The air in the living room grew thick with tension. Alex’s heart sank, the weight of Susannah’s words pressing down on him.
Susannah studied her son, seeing the determination in his eyes. Her tone softened, but the frustration still lingered. “Look, Alex, I only want what’s best for you. You’re not a kid anymore, and it’s time you start thinking about getting married. I’ve already arranged meetings with some respectable young women from good families. At least give them a chance…” 
.

###Chapter 267:
“Stop!” Alex cut her off sharply, his voice strained with frustration. “I’ll decide what’s best for my life! And when it comes to Sadie, I don’t need your interference!”
Alex turned and stormed out of the room, leaving Susannah alone, stunned on the sofa.
Susannah watched her son walk away, her emotions a whirlwind. She knew Alex wasn’t backing down.
Rubbing her temples, she felt the weight of exhaustion press down on her. She closed her eyes, her mind racing.
The Howe family was no ordinary household. It had traditions as rigid as stone. How could a single mother, no matter how remarkable, ever be accepted into their world?
Even if she could somehow come to terms with it, what about Alex’s father? And his grandfather? Would they ever look past Sadie’s past?
Sadie walked hand in hand with Averi, who was bouncing energetically beside her. In her other hand, she carried a thermal food jar given by Laura, her expression calm and content.
“Mom,” Averi said, his wide, curious eyes looking at her. “When is Alex coming to play with us again?”
Sadie chuckled softly, her hand gently ruffling his hair. “Alex is a very busy man, sweetheart. But I’m sure he’ll visit us again soon when he has some free time.”
As they reached their apartment building, Sadie saw Alex standing at the entrance as if he had been waiting for them. Dressed in a crisp white shirt, he looked effortlessly handsome, his presence both striking and comforting.
At the sight of Sadie and Averi, Alex’s face lit up with a warm smile. He approached them, his voice filled with genuine warmth. “Sadie, Averi,” he greeted, his eyes lingering on Averi with unmistakable fondness.noveldrama
When Averi spotted Alex, he broke free from Sadie’s hand and dashed toward him, his little feet carrying him as fast as they could. “Alex!” he called out, his voice brimming with excitement.
gα?ησν?sоm, your fiction hub
Alex bent down gracefully and scooped Averi up into his arms, lifting him high above his head. Averi’s pure and joyful laughter filled the air, echoing around them.
“Well, well,” Alex teased, his voice playful. “Someone seems happy to see me. Did you miss me, buddy?”
Averi nodded vigorously, his excitement barely contained. “I did! Alex, can you play with me today?” he asked, his eyes sparkling with anticipation.
Alex glanced at Sadie, his expression softening as he spoke gently to Averi. “I need to have a quick chat with your mom first, okay? How about you play on your own for a little while?”
Though a flicker of disappointment crossed Averi’s face, he nodded obediently. He slid out of Alex’s arms and dashed off to explore the nearby playground. The neighborhood was tightly secured, allowing Sadie and Alex to chat without worrying about his safety.
Once Averi was out of earshot, Alex turned to Sadie, his expression tinged with guilt. “Sadie,” he began, his voice low and careful. “Can we talk?”
Sadie’s eyes met Alex’s, a flicker of uncertainty passing through them before she gave a quiet nod. She also sensed that some things needed to be said between them.
They walked over to a bench beside a vibrant flowerbed and sat down. The air between them felt heavy, charged with unspoken words. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 268:noveldrama
Alex inhaled deeply, his hands clasped tightly in his lap as he gathered his thoughts. “Sadie, about what my mom said earlier…” He paused, searching for the right words. “Please don’t take it to heart. She’s just… she doesn’t always understand.”
“Your mom is right,” Sadie interjected softly, her gaze dropping momentarily as she carefully chose her next words. “My situation is… complicated. Alex, I’m truly grateful for all you’ve done for me and Averi recently. But…” She hesitated, her voice gentle yet firm. “I haven’t considered anything beyond that.”
Alex met Sadie’s gaze, recognizing the soft rejection in her clear eyes. He swallowed the disappointment that began to rise. “Sadie, I understand your concerns, but…”
He attempted to continue, but Sadie interrupted him softly, shaking her head. “Alex,” she said, her tone kind but firm. “You’re an amazing person. But right now, my life is about Averi. He’s my priority, and I don’t have the energy or the heart to focus on anything else.”
Alex’s throat tightened as he watched Sadie, his eyes filled with a quiet frustration he couldn’t hide.
As Sadie looked at Alex, her heart ached. The sincerity in his eyes was unmistakable, and she could feel his genuine care for her. Yet, despite her appreciation for him, she couldn’t reciprocate his feelings. Her past experiences, a failed marriage, and the emotional burden of raising Averi alone loomed large in her mind.
Moreover, the fear of hastily entering a new relationship weighed heavily on her. For Sadie, Alex had always been a supportive friend, nothing more, and she wasn’t prepared to change that perception.
Nearby, Averi had been playing by himself for a while, but the fun was starting to fade. He glanced over at Sadie and Alex, sitting on the bench, talking in hushed tones. They seemed so absorbed in their conversation that they hadn’t noticed him.
Averi nudged a small stone with his foot, causing him to trip and nearly tumble to the ground.
é t?€я? ?n Ga?n?νεl?.
“Watch out!” a deep voice called out from behind, and a strong hand quickly stabilized Averi.
Raising his eyes, Averi recognized the distinctly defined face above him.
Standing there was Noah.
Dressed sharply in a suit, Noah looked more imposing than ever, his deep-set eyes giving him an aloof air.
As Noah’s eyes landed on Averi, his stern expression melted into a gentler one. He signaled for Samuel, who was close behind, to proceed to the car without him.
With a silent nod, Samuel headed toward the sleek black sedan at the roadside.
Averi, who remembered Noah from a fun day at the hospital where they had played with toys, grinned widely and reached up eagerly.
“Noah!”
Feeling a sudden warmth in his heart, Noah bent down, lifting Averi into his arms.
“What are you doing here all by yourself? Where is your mom?”
“Mom’s over there!”
Averi directed his little finger towards Sadie and Alex, who were comfortably seated on a bench beside the flowerbed. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 269:
Following Averi’s gesture, Noah’s gaze landed on Sadie and Alex sitting intimately under the dim glow of a yellow streetlight.
The sight caused Noah’s fist to tighten reflexively, a wave of bitterness washing over him.
So Sadie left her child alone to be close with another man?
When Alex noticed Noah, his expression changed abruptly, the smile vanishing from his face.
Surprise also flashed across Sadie’s face; she had not expected to see Noah here.
Samuel had informed her that Noah was on a business trip overseas and wouldn’t return soon. Yet, here he was.
When Alex saw Sadie lost in thought as she looked at Noah, a stab of pain hit him. “Sadie, you still haven’t moved on from him?”
Taken aback, Sadie was not prepared for Alex’s question. Noah, cradling Averi, was close enough that every word was clearly audible to him. Silently, he watched the interaction, a subtle flicker of expectation visible in his eyes.
What was he expecting? What was he hoping Sadie would say?
Chaos churned within Sadie’s heart. For a brief moment, she was at a loss for words in response to Alex. “I don’t know.”
Her voice carried a tone of detachment, and she avoided looking at Noah. Swiftly, she got to her feet and gestured for Averi to leave Noah’s embrace.
“Averi, we’re heading home.”
With urgency, she guided her son towards the elevator, eager to leave the heavy air behind them. Her heart thudded violently, threatening to break free from her chest. It felt as if an unseen force clutched at her heart, squeezing the breath from her lungs.
g?lnσν?s?com takes you to new worlds
Once Sadie vanished inside the building, Alex approached Noah.
“Mr. Wall, I wasn’t aware you still enjoyed unsettling your ex-wife.”
Noah responded with a cold chuckle, “Ex-wife? Alex, she and I are still legally bound. Moreover, this property belongs to Wall Group.” He stressed “Wall Group” pointedly, his voice laced with a veiled threat.
Only then did Alex take a moment to observe his surroundings. It dawned on him that he was standing on a property developed by Wall Group the previous year. A silence fell over Alex as he recognized his oversight.
It just so happened that Sadie’s apartment was located within a Wall Group property. It seemed unlikely to anyone that this wasn’t orchestrated by Noah.
“Noah, the two of you are over. Why can’t you just move on?” Alex asked.
Noah offered no reply, merely scoffing before he walked away.
The sound of the car door shutting echoed as Noah settled back into the leather seat, his expression shadowed, the atmosphere heavy with an undeniable melancholy.
“She said she didn’t know, did she? How ridiculous!”noveldrama
“Mr. Wall, without even pausing to rest after your flight, you came directly to see Mrs. Wall. Should we return to the office or head to Myrtlewood Estate?” Samuel, positioned in the front seat, voiced his concern.
Initially, Samuel believed Noah’s haste was due to concerns about the situation with Kyla. But the moment Noah landed, he headed straight to see her. It was then that Samuel understood his error. 
.

###Chapter 270:
Noah sighed, pressing his fingers to his temples. “She’s out on bail. Mrs. Wall has arranged a position for her at the branch office.”
Acknowledging the update with a nod, Noah instructed, “Get in touch with Kyla. Tell her to meet me at Myrtlewood Estate.”
Samuel hesitated momentarily before saying, “Understood, Mr. Wall.” Casting a surreptitious glance at Noah in the rearview mirror, Samuel noted the deepening shadow over his features. Opting not to say more, Samuel promptly made the call to Kyla.
Meanwhile, Kyla’s carefully maintained calm was shattered by the sudden ring of her phone. It was Samuel.noveldrama
Kyla’s chest tightened as a wave of unease crept over her. She gathered her composure and accepted the call.
“Miss Wade, Mr. Wall requests that you come to Myrtlewood Estate now,” Samuel said, maintaining a formal yet distant demeanor.
Kyla’s hand clenched around her phone. The inevitable was unfolding. She had anticipated that this matter wouldn’t blow over so easily. Facing her mirror, she altered her pristine makeup, intentionally adding redness to her eyes to appear more distressed and pitiful.
Lights blazed across Myrtlewood Estate as Kyla rushed in.
Seated comfortably on a leather sofa, Noah had his legs crossed, a glass of red wine in his grasp. His cold, hard stare created a thick air of tension that Kyla sensed intensely.
Tears swiftly gathered in her eyes as she bit her lower lip.
“Noah…” Her voice shook. “I realize… you think it was me.”
G a lno ve ls . com is where the magic begins
Before Noah could reply, she hid her face in her hands, her sobs breaking through quietly. “But I swear, I didn’t do it. I didn’t take the pink diamond. I don’t know how it got into my possession…” Tears streamed down her face as she quivered slightly, her appearance one of vulnerability and despair.
Noah observed her quietly, his expression inscrutable, his eyes revealing nothing of his thoughts. He gently placed the wine glass on the table, the faint sound breaking the stillness of the room.
“Kyla,” he said in a calm, measured tone. “There’s nothing I despise more than dishonesty.”
Kyla looked up, her face wet with tears, her eyes filled with hurt. “Noah, how could you think I would lie to you? My love for you is so deep.”
Her hand trembled as she reached out to him, pausing uncertainly in the air. Noah’s eyes shifted to her outstretched fingers, maintaining a stoic facade.
The room felt increasingly oppressive, the air heavy with a mix of perfumes, including Kyla’s distinct scent. Noah found his thoughts in disarray.
Recent events, especially those concerning the pink diamond, forced him to harbor doubts about her. He detested the notion of being misled, yet his reluctance to distrust her gnawed at him even more. He should trust Kyla.
However, the image of Sadie’s delicate, pale face repeatedly intruded on his thoughts, causing a persistent throb in his head.
Eventually, Kyla’s crying began to quiet. Noah approached her, looking down at her. “I hope you’re telling the truth.”
Trying to steady herself, Kyla insisted, “I swear, I really didn’t take that pink diamond!” 
.
.

###Chapter 271:
Kyla subtly watched as Noah’s stern expression began to soften.
Her pounding heart started to settle.
What hold did Sadie have over Noah?
Tightening her fists, Kyla decided to change the subject.
“Um, I have to go to Stonemont Estate tomorrow to talk about a project with Ms. Shaw, but…” She hesitated, her lip caught between her teeth, tears welling up in her eyes again. She added, “But she won’t agree to meet with me. I—I’m at a loss.”
Kyla lifted her gaze to Noah, her eyes filled with helplessness, her voice barely above a whisper. “Could you possibly come with me?”
Noah paused briefly. He was familiar with the Stonemont Estate project. This project was minor, the branch office’s last project for the year, and had minimal effect on overall profits. Eva, known for her tough demeanor, posed challenges that were infamous within the industry, explaining Kyla’s difficulties. Kyla’s involvement seemed to be a strategic move to strengthen her standing. So it seemed.
Following a thoughtful silence, Noah responded in a professional tone, “At what time?”
Feeling a wave of relief, Kyla relaxed and answered promptly, “At ten in the morning.”
Noah nodded in agreement.
Kyla raised her head, managing a grateful smile. “Thanks, Noah.”
Noah left the room and made his way up to his study. As he ignited a cigarette, smoke began to curl around the space, the tip of the cigarette casting a weak glow in the muted lighting.

Sadie’s hesitant voice haunted him, repeating, “I don’t know…” He inhaled deeply from the cigarette before crushing it out in a crystal ashtray.
In his agitation, he yanked at his tie.noveldrama
Meanwhile, in Sadie’s bedroom, the only light came from a bedside lamp. Lying awake on her bed, Sadie was lost in thought. She gazed up at the ceiling, pondering her next move. Wasn’t she supposed to let go of Noah?
They had shared years of life together, which ultimately led to their divorce. It seemed right to let go. After all, his heart belonged to Kyla, not to her.
A sad smile appeared on her lips as tears silently streaked down her face, dampening the silk pillowcase. She then turned to her side, pressing her face into the pillow.
Light rain persisted throughout the night and continued as dawn broke. Clouds covered the sky completely, leaving the roads wet and shiny.
Carol showed up early. Sadie asked her to take care of Averi as she got ready to leave. She had an important task today. She was dressed in a dark trench coat with her hair loosely tied back, strands softly outlining her finely shaped face. As she gripped the business card Leanna had provided, her face was set with determination.
“Take me to Stonemont Estate, please,” she said to the cab driver. The cab driver looked hesitant as he scrutinized the blurry mountain road through the windshield.
“The road up the mountain is dangerous, especially with all this rain. If we run into trouble…” he explained, his voice trailing off.
“I’ll pay extra,” Sadie promptly responded.

###Chapter 272:
After a brief pause, the driver started the engine.
Stonemont Estate was already on Sadie’s mind. The estate was owned by Eva, who was well-known for being a tough negotiator. Securing a partnership would not only solidify but possibly enhance her studio’s standing significantly.
As they drove up the winding path, the rain grew heavier. Even with the windshield wipers moving fast, the thick fog remained difficult to clear.
Upon reaching the midpoint of the ascent, the driver abruptly hit the brakes.
“I’m sorry, miss, but it’s too risky to continue. The road is too slick,” he said, fear evident in his pale face and trembling voice.
Despair gripped Sadie as she realized the driver’s concerns were valid. The mountain path was both narrow and steep, made treacherous by the rain.
Attempting to maintain her composure, she said, “Sir, I’ll pay triple. Would you please take me to the top?”
But the driver was resolute in his refusal.
“It’s not about the money, miss. I have a family to think about, and I can’t risk our lives over this.”
Sadie opened her mouth to protest, but the driver continued, “I’m sorry, miss, but this is as far as I go.”
A wave of anxiety washed over Sadie, though she understood his point. After paying him, she watched as the cab turned and vanished into the rainy mist.
Standing alone at the roadside, Sadie paused, her gaze fixed on the mountain path now shrouded in rain and fog, feeling a surge of helplessness. Her umbrella was up, but it hardly kept the relentless rain at bay. Her coat was quickly drenched, sending chills deep into her bones. With each step she took, the muddy road became tougher to tread.
Yet, she pressed on, her jaw set firmly.
From the misty haze, a black Maybach glided silently toward her. Hope sparked in Sadie’s chest. She might still find a way forward! She stepped boldly into the road, waving down the approaching vehicle.
ε ￠t?€я? ?η ?a?и?νê.
The car slowed to a halt and the window slid down, revealing a face that was familiar yet unsettling.
Noah was inside, looking as refined and unruffled as always. His gaze, unreadable as ever, landed on the soaked figure of Sadie standing in the rain. Sadie stood still, shocked. What shocked her even more was that Kyla was sitting beside him, her sleek hair cascading over her shoulders, her makeup impeccable, dressed in a white gown that accentuated her allure.
Seeing Kyla free so soon from the police station was beyond Sadie’s expectations. A heaviness descended upon her heart.noveldrama
She remembered the previous evening when Noah had shown up outside her apartment building, likely there to confront her about Kyla. Kyla’s eyes shifted toward Sadie, radiating a smug satisfaction.
However, her expression quickly changed to one of fake concern. “Sadie, what brings you out here? Where are you headed all by yourself? Let Noah and me give you a lift. He won’t mind,” she suggested with feigned sweetness.
Yet Sadie remained motionless.
Noah’s gaze was fixed on her, deep and intense, as it always had been, his thoughts unreadable. When he saw Sadie’s lack of response, his face grew stern.
“If you’re not coming, then just stay here,” he said coldly.
Samuel, behind the wheel, glanced at Noah in the rearview mirror, then at Sadie in the rain. He seemed hesitant about what to do next. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 273:
As the car started moving, Sadie’s anxiety surged. She thought about the collaboration with Eva and realized that if she had to ascend the mountain on foot, it would only make things worse and potentially put her in danger. Even if she did make it to the Stonemont Estate, it would likely be late into the evening.
Taking a deep breath, Sadie opened the passenger door and got into the vehicle.
The vehicle was filled with a subtle fragrance, unmistakably Kyla’s favorite perfume. Feeling slightly suffocated, Sadie shifted uncomfortably.
Kyla’s eyes lingered on her drenched form, a sense of pleasure apparent in her expression. Without a word, Samuel ignited the engine and steered toward the mountaintop. Warmth enveloped the car’s interior.
The rain had thoroughly drenched Sadie’s attire, causing it to cling to her figure. Her trench coat, altered by the rain, now sported darker shades, staining the cream-colored leather seat beneath.
Kyla, noticing the discoloration, feigned innocence as she commented, “Sadie, it looks like your coat is staining.”
Catching Kyla’s glance, Sadie inspected the edge of her damp coat, noticing the change herself. Today, she had chosen a dark blue trench coat—not a luxury item but still costly. It seemed unlikely to bleed.
Embarrassment flushed through Sadie, yet she maintained her composure and responded, “Oh, is it?”
With a suppressed giggle, Kyla acted concerned. “I’ve brought extra clothes. Why not change into one of them? You might catch cold in those. And don’t worry, Noah selected these, so they’re sure not to bleed color.”
Internally, Kyla smirked, well aware that Sadie would never accept her clothing; the offer was merely a calculated insult.
Sadie was well aware of Kyla’s motives. She managed a slight, bitter smile and said, “No, thank you for your offer.”
?@?é$? t?εя? íπ ?alπoνεl?.c
Kyla, realizing Sadie was not provoked, changed the topic. She shifted her gaze towards the window before inquiring, “By the way, Sadie, what’s your destination?”
“Stonemont Estate,” Sadie answered tersely.
“Stonemont Estate?” Kyla echoed, caught off guard.
A heavy feeling settled in Sadie’s chest.
What a coincidence. Could it be that Noah and Kyla were on their way to Stonemont Estate for the same purpose?
Sadie shivered, a cold sensation creeping up her spine.
From the rearview mirror, Samuel saw Noah’s countenance darken and, grasping the situation, promptly said, “Mrs. Wall, we’re on our way to Stonemont Estate as well.”
Hearing Samuel address her that way deepened Sadie’s discomfort. With a composed and firm voice, she corrected him, saying, “Please, I am not ‘Mrs. Wall.'”
Kyla’s expression soured at once.
That Samuel—why did he still refer to Sadie as “Mrs. Wall”?
A tense, cold silence enveloped the car.
Kyla’s hands formed fists so tight that her nails dug painfully into her palms. 
.

###Chapter 274:
She fantasized about casting Sadie from the vehicle right at that moment.
Finally, the Maybach smoothly halted at the ornate iron gates of Stonemont Estate.
The rain continued unabated, its heavy drops beating a rhythmic pitter-patter against the windows.
Samuel was quick to exit the car, unfurling a large black umbrella and courteously holding the door open for Noah and Kyla.
Noah emerged, his tall figure clad in a black suit, looking striking yet emotionless.
Kyla, dressed elegantly in a white gown, tightly gripped Noah’s arm, her makeup flawless.
Sadie exited the vehicle from the other side, managing her umbrella by herself.
Awaiting their arrival was the estate’s butler, who promptly advanced with a respectful bow as he spotted Noah and Kyla. “Mr. Wall, Miss Wade, welcome.”
Spotting Sadie, drenched from the rain, the butler momentarily registered surprise before composing himself and quietly asking, “And… who is this lady?”
Noah gave Sadie a cold look and remained silent.
With Kyla poised to speak while still linked to Noah, Sadie quickly interjected, “Hello, I’m Sadie Hudson, referred by Mrs. Leanna Lawrence of the Lawrence Group. I’m here to visit Ms. Shaw.” The butler’s confusion resolved into clarity.
Smiling apologetically at Sadie, he said, “Oh, Miss Hudson. You’re quite wet—it’s easy to catch a cold in that state. Please, come inside and change into dry clothes.”
Sadie paused briefly before agreeing with a nod.noveldrama
The butler continued, “Mr. Wall, a servant will escort you and Miss Wade to the gazebo, and I’ll inform Ms. Shaw immediately.”
New updates in glησvs?com
After a final look at Sadie, Noah walked away in the other direction.
The butler guided Sadie through the opulently decorated hall, and they reached a guest room filled with warmth and the soothing scent of lavender.
“Miss Hudson, please make yourself comfortable here while I fetch some fresh clothing,” he said before exiting the room.
Exhausted, Sadie grabbed a towel from the bathroom and sank into the soft sofa to dry off her hair.
The butler had seemed to be familiar with Noah and Kyla earlier. Most likely, they were here for a business collaboration too. But why would Noah be interested in working with Eva?
Shortly, the butler returned with clothing—a cream cashmere sweater and light gray pants.
“Miss, these belong to Ms. Shaw. They should fit you for the time being,” he said politely.
Sadie expressed her gratitude, and the butler departed.
After slipping into the provided clothes, Sadie felt the cashmere’s gentle warmth against her skin, though it did little to loosen up the coldness settling in her heart.
Despite knowing her studio stood little chance against the might of Wall Group, Sadie was determined not to back down now that she was here.
She was just smoothing the oversized sleeves when Kyla entered, her heels clicking authoritatively on the floor, radiating an air of dominance. Her face was twisted into a mocking sneer. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 275:
“Well, look at the great designer, Sadie Hudson, wearing someone else’s clothes,” Kyla said, scanning the room with a sarcastic tilt of her head. “This estate isn’t open to just anyone. Don’t tell me you actually think cozying up to Lawrence Group will suddenly make you important.”
With her head lowered, Sadie chose not to engage with Kyla. All she wanted was to get out of there as quickly as possible.
Kyla’s smugness grew as she observed Sadie’s reticence. She stepped closer, her expression filled with scorn.
“Noah’s attention is focused solely on me. No matter my actions, he will always defend me. You, however, are insignificant to him.”
“You…” Sadie struggled to contain her rising fury. “Stay out of my relationship with Noah.”
Kyla’s sneer deepened. “And who might you be? You’re just a passing amusement for him. Once he grows bored, he’ll discard you without a second glance.”
With her lips pressed tightly together, Sadie’s complexion turned ashen.
Deep down, she acknowledged the harsh truth in Kyla’s words.
After all, it had already been proven right three years ago.
Suddenly, a relaxed voice floated in from the doorway, sounding almost as if the speaker was just strolling by.
“Why all the animosity, young lady?”
Both Sadie and Kyla whipped their heads around.
At the entrance stood a woman in gardening attire, smeared with dirt, playfully wielding a pair of pruning shears, her smile teasing. Loose strands of her long, dark hair framed her face, enhancing her sultry, captivating appearance.
I?t€$? ￠н?ρ?ε ?и glov?l.om
Kyla’s face clouded over, and she retorted sharply, “Shut up. What concern is it of yours? When did we start letting servants speak up?” A heaviness settled in Sadie’s chest; she didn’t want to draw someone else into her dispute with Kyla.
“Miss Wade, if you are that remarkable, why haven’t you become Mrs. Wall after three years yet?”
Sadie gazed at the “gardener.”
“I’m sorry for what happened, and thank you for your intervention.” The woman, mistaken for a gardener, wore a playful yet slightly puzzled expression as she glanced between Sadie and Kyla.
A mix of anger and humiliation colored Kyla’s cheeks.
The audacity of Sadie!
“Typical. You’re both lowly people. Sadie, you’re destined to remain among those servants!”
Now, Kyla’s disdain was fully evident.
Before Sadie could formulate a reply, the butler emerged at the entrance.
“Ms. Shaw, Mr. Wall is here.”
Ms. Shaw?noveldrama
Both Sadie and Kyla turned to stone, their eyes fixed on the woman standing in the doorway.
This woman, disheveled with mud, was actually Eva, the estate’s owner?
Color drained from Kyla’s face; she had not anticipated insulting Eva directly. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 276:
Eva passed the pruning shears to the butler and brushed the dirt off her hands. She then strolled towards them, her lips curved in a subtle smile.
“I’m sorry, could you repeat what you said earlier? I didn’t quite hear you.”
Kyla attempted to speak, but no words came. Overwhelmed with embarrassment, she felt a burning desire to disappear right there and then.
Sadie was equally stunned; she hadn’t anticipated running into Eva in this setting.
Eva, a globally recognized investor and a formidable businesswoman, was known for her keen intuition and ruthless strategies in the corporate world.
Yet here she was, clad in the humble attire of a gardener.
Her presence instantly transformed the room’s tension into an evident discomfort.
Kyla was unnerved.
She now regretted her earlier harsh words, worried that Eva might mention the incident to Noah.
What would happen if Noah learned of this?
Kyla managed a strained smile, attempting to formulate an apology, but found herself speechless.
Eva gave Kyla a measured look, then turned and departed silently.noveldrama
Left behind in the guest room, Sadie and Kyla felt the oppressive silence envelop them.
Kyla clenched her jaw, clinging to her dwindling dignity.
“Just you wait, Sadie! Sooner or later, Noah will uncover your true colors!” With those words, she hastily exited, her heels echoing sharply against the floor.
Check exclusive content gα?ησνs?com
The door to the guest room closed loudly, echoing through the hallway. Exhausted, Sadie massaged her temples.
Her recent clash with Kyla had been an exhausting and futile display. Her only desire now was to exit the room swiftly.
She approached a servant and inquired softly about the way to the gazebo.
The servant directed her with a polite gesture, and she walked down a glass-walled corridor.
Located by a man-made lake and surrounded by lush trees, the gazebo offered a calm and refined retreat.
From afar, Sadie could see Noah and Eva, who had changed clothes, enjoying a relaxed conversation in the gazebo.
They shared laughs in a sociable and light-hearted exchange.
Eva lifted her coffee for a sip, her gaze playfully fixed on Noah as she joked, “Noah, I thought you were overseas on business. I tried contacting you but you were always unavailable! What brings you here today? And with two beautiful women no less—are we expecting a spectacle at my estate?”
Just then, Kyla also reached the gazebo.
Her complexion was ashen, and she looked visibly anxious. Approaching Eva, she bowed deeply. “Ms. Shaw, I apologize for my earlier behavior.”
Eva responded to her apology with a lukewarm half-smile, turning her attention back to Noah.
Observing this, Sadie moved closer as well.
She said, “Ms. Shaw, I have no personal ties with Mr. Wall. I was merely sharing a ride with him.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 277:
Noah looked up at her, his expression enigmatic, and he said nothing.
Eva regarded Sadie with appreciation, clearly intrigued.
Sadie appeared much more compelling than Eva had initially thought. Previously, the butler had already relayed to Eva that this was the Sadie Leanna had mentioned.
Now seeing her firsthand, Eva could understand why Leanna had spoken so highly of Sadie. Sadie truly stood out, especially compared to someone who was merely superficial.
Besides, Noah’s strikingly handsome features typically drew admiring glances from many women. Sadie, however, wasn’t one to be easily swayed.
Sadie handed over a meticulously prepared collaboration proposal to Eva.
“Ms. Shaw, please review this collaboration proposal from our studio.”
Eva took the document and flipped through it casually.
“The proposal is quite standard, though you’ve obviously given it considerable thought,” Eva commented, her voice neutral, giving nothing away.noveldrama
Without showing much reaction, she shut the proposal and placed it to the side. “I tend to avoid the conventional. I’m already familiar with the operations of your studio and the Wall Group.”
Indeed, Wall Group’s branch office had been relentlessly in touch with her, so much so that it had become somewhat overwhelming.
Eva’s eyes shifted playfully between Sadie and Noah as she suggested, “Here’s my offer. Tonight, you’ll both have the opportunity to impress me. Use Stonemont Estate as your inspiration to create a design. The one whose design captivates me more will earn a chance at partnership.”
Noah’s brow knitted together, and just as he was about to respond, Eva lifted a hand, silencing him. “Mr. Wall, I understand the time is tight, but genuine talent thrives under pressure, wouldn’t you say?”
Eva’s lips, tinted red, curved into a smile as she lifted her coffee cup, motioning as though inviting Noah to a toast.
Lλtτ чhαρτ?r? ιn gl?ov?ls.
Noah remained silent, merely taking a sip of his coffee.
Kyla’s complexion turned paler.
How could anyone be expected to create a design sophisticated enough to secure Eva’s favor in such a short time? It seemed like an obvious setup for failure!
Just then, the butler rushed towards them, his face etched with concern. “Ms. Shaw, there’s been an incident! The mountain road is completely destroyed by the rain. We’re cut off. It’s unlikely the path will be cleared before noon tomorrow.”
Eva’s eyebrow arched as she pondered the news. “Well then, it seems you three will need to stay here at the estate for the night.”
Observing that Noah raised no ions, Eva instructed, “Please have someone prepare the guest rooms.”
As the butler departed to follow Eva’s orders, she watched Noah and Sadie with an expressive look.
Noah’s attention subtly drifted toward Sadie, while he completely ignored Kyla by his side.
Eva was aware of the whispers suggesting Kyla was the love of Noah’s life. However, the current dynamics hinted otherwise.
Her interest in the real connection between Noah and Sadie deepened. All the while, Sadie was deeply engrossed in refining her design proposal, unaware of Eva’s scrutinizing eyes. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 278:noveldrama
Sadie narrowed her eyes, her brows knitted.
Kyla and Sadie each departed to prepare for the design competition. In the gazebo, Eva and Noah were the only two left.
“Noah, who do you think will win?” Eva inquired, her incisive gaze fixed on Noah as though anticipating significant insight.
Noah gazed toward the distant mountains, his face a mask of detachment, his lips sealed. He offered no answer.
Eva let out a soft laugh and shook her head. “You haven’t changed—still as dull as ever.”
From the first time Eva encountered Noah, she recognized his demeanor. He was a man known for guarding his emotions closely.
Meanwhile, Kyla rushed into an adjacent corridor and quickly called the Wall Group’s design team.
As she paced back and forth, she issued orders as soon as someone answered. “Start working immediately. I want designs that reflect elements of Stonemont Estate. Send several drafts to my inbox by tonight.”
There was a pause on the line.
“Miss Wade, with such short notice… I’m not sure if…”
“Just make it happen, no matter what it takes!” Kyla commanded, abruptly interrupting the other person.
She was determined not to be outdone by Sadie.
At that moment, the butler rounded the corner, three room keys in his hand.
Kyla’s thoughts quickly aligned, and she approached him. “Could you please pass me those cards? I’m going in that direction and can easily deliver them to Noah and Sadie,” she said, offering a convincingly sweet and courteous smile as if she were extending a kindness.
Check what’s new on g@lnovs.c○m
The butler paused momentarily but then relinquished the cards.
Given her proximity to Noah, he found it difficult to deny her request. Kyla subtly traced her fingers along the edges of the cards, already devising a strategy.
Tonight could offer the chance she had been anticipating…
Now was the moment for Sadie to understand her true place. Inside her, a spark of hope was kindled—tonight could potentially change everything.
When Sadie returned to her guest room, she discovered the door slightly open, rendering the need for a room card unnecessary.
She found a peaceful spot to sit, unfolded the paper, and began her design.
The quiet scratch of her pencil against the paper filled the room as she diligently outlined sleek, graceful curves.
Deeply focused on her task, Sadie blocked out all distractions.
This was her opportunity to demonstrate her capabilities.
At noon, the dining room boasted a grand display of various dishes.
Eva had already taken her seat, and Noah was there too, his gaze lingering on the empty seat beside him, his expression tinged with concern.
Kyla, caught up in her evening’s scheming, missed the fleeting expressions in Noah’s eyes.
She retrieved three room cards from her purse and placed them on the table. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 279:
“Noah, you are staying in Room 316.”
As Eva started to speak, she accidentally brushed a cup, tipping it over. Water cascaded across the table and onto the cards.noveldrama
“Oh dear, I’m terribly sorry,” Eva said, grasping a napkin to dab at the mess.
“No worries, Ms. Shaw,” Kyla responded, masking her initial panic with a smile.
Kyla sifted through the now slightly wet cards and handed what she believed was the card for Room 316 to Noah.
Unbeknownst to her, the card she handed over was actually for Room 319—the room assigned to Sadie.
A subtle thrill of triumph fluttered in Kyla’s heart. They would be staying at Stonemont Estate tonight, seemingly guided by fate itself!
Noah took the card with a subtle nod, not examining it too closely.
Eva watched the interaction, an intrigued smile creeping onto her face. The unfolding drama intrigued her more with each passing moment.
As dusk settled, the lights of Stonemont Estate began to twinkle against the night sky.
At the bar, Kyla held a crystal glass, delicately swirling its contents.
With no one watching, Kyla smoothly retrieved a small vial from her purse and tipped its contents into the drink, her actions quick and discreet.
The powder dissolved instantly, leaving no sign it had ever been there. Spotting a servant nearby, she slipped him a stack of hundred-dollar bills.
“Please, bring this drink to Mr. Wall,” she instructed.
The servant’s eyes lit up at the cash, and he eagerly agreed.
Latest chapters ?αlnσνes?com
“Absolutely, Miss Wade. I’ll ensure it reaches Mr. Wall.”
Content with her arrangements, Kyla turned and left for her room. She slipped into a light purple silk nightgown, her hair flowing down her back, enhancing her seductive appearance.
Tonight, if she could sleep with Noah, the title of Mrs. Wall might soon be hers.
And if the night ended with her carrying his child? Even better.
Noah was enveloped in warm, yellow light as he stood in the kitchen. He took off the slightly damp apron and casually hung it over the back of a chair.
Eva, with a playful glint in her eyes, leaned against the doorframe, her lips a striking red.
“Are you trying to impress someone with your cooking, Mr. Wall? It’s unusual to see you in the kitchen. Who are you doing this for?”
Her playful tone contrasted with her gaze, which wandered in the direction of Sadie’s room.
Without a word, Noah glanced at her indifferently and proceeded toward the dining room. His tall stature cast a long shadow under the light, enhancing his imposing presence.
Eva smiled softly, recognizing his silence as a sign of deep thought. She chose not to delve deeper, knowing when to leave him be. At that moment, a servant entered, carefully balancing a tray as he approached Noah.
“Mr. Wall, here’s a fresh whiskey cocktail from the bar, meant to aid relaxation and sleep,” he said, bowing his head to avoid Noah’s gaze.
Noah’s eyebrow arched as he eyed the amber liquid on the tray, the whiskey’s rich, subtly sweet aroma filling the air.

###Chapter 280:
He grabbed the glass without hesitation and downed its contents in one swift motion.
Eva observed him with a trace of confusion flickering across her face.
After setting the glass back down, Noah felt an unusual warmth coursing through him. He frowned, puzzled by the odd sensation washing over him.
“What’s wrong, Noah? Are you feeling okay?” Eva asked, her voice laced with concern.
He nodded his head, dismissing her worries. Just as he was about to respond, a wave of dizziness overwhelmed him. His vision blurred, and the room seemed to whirl around him. Noah staggered, clutching the table’s edge to keep himself upright.
Sadie was engrossed in her design sketches, completely oblivious to the time slipping by.noveldrama
Only when the sky outside turned pitch black and the room’s light dimmed did she finally pause, rubbing her weary eyes.
A loud growl from her stomach signaled that it was dinner time. Stretching lazily, Sadie rose to relieve her stiff muscles. Her long, dark hair framed her face, accentuating her natural beauty as she moved.
A knock at the door interrupted the silence.
“Come in.”
The door swung open, and a uniformed servant stepped in, a tray in hand and a respectful smile on his face. “Miss Hudson, your dinner is served.”
He set the tray on the table, lifted the lid, and unveiled a spread of delicate dishes, a tempting scent wafting through the air.
Sadie’s eyes widened in recognition of her favorites. A hint of surprise crossed her face. Had Eva planned this surprise?
1@?€?? ￠t?êя$ íи galovels.om
“Thank you,” she said warmly, rewarding the servant with a smile. She then settled at the table and reached for her fork.
She bit into the glazed chicken, letting the tangy-sweet sauce coat her tongue. The tender meat practically melted in her mouth.
The meal was delicious, and Sadie relished each bite. Yet, during the meal, a curious thought struck her. She puzzled over how Eva could know her favorite dishes, as she had never mentioned them.
Once her plate was clean, Sadie returned to her work. The design was finally coming together, prompting a deep sigh of relief from her.
The peacefulness of the room was suddenly shattered by the ringing of her phone.
As Sadie picked up her phone, she saw Alex’s name on the display. She paused, then decisively pressed the answer button.
“Sadie, where are you?” Alex’s voice rang out, tense with urgency.
“I’m at Stonemont Estate,” Sadie responded briefly. “I’m here to discuss a potential collaboration with Ms. Shaw.”
“Stonemont Estate?” Alex’s confusion was evident. “And you’re still there at this hour?”
“I’m stranded; the mountain road was destroyed by the rain. I won’t be able to return until tomorrow,” she explained. Silence followed from Alex’s side for a moment.
“I’ll drive over to pick you up tomorrow,” Alex finally said. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 281:
Sadie let out a gentle sigh. “Really, Alex, I’m okay. There’s no need to worry.”
Alex started to speak, but Sadie cut him off, saying, “I need to get back to work now. I’m going to hang up.”
She ended the call before Alex could reply, setting her phone beside her sketches. Her eyes returned to her design, but her mind wandered.
Ding—
The abrupt ring of the doorbell jolted Sadie from her thoughts. Frowning slightly, she assumed it was just a servant and rose to answer the door.
Her fingers had just grazed the doorknob when she heard the distinct sound of a door card being used.
As the door swung open, she was surprised not to see a servant but Noah standing there instead.
His towering presence dimmed the hallway light, and his gaze, dark and intense, was fixed solely on her.
A cold dread swept through Sadie, weighing down on her heart. “Why… why are you here?” she stammered, her voice shaking as she instinctively retreated a step.
Noah hesitated, his expression one of confusion as he seemed to wonder why Sadie was in “his” room.
He remained silent, his intense stare making Sadie increasingly uncomfortable.
The familiarity of his look unnerved her; it was identical to the one he had often given her three years earlier—the fiery intensity in his eyes… Overwhelmed, she turned her head away, trying to escape the overwhelming atmosphere.
However, Noah quickly closed the distance.
In a swift motion, he encircled her waist with his arm, drawing her close against him.
G al no vel s . com holds tales worth reading
“Sadie…” His voice was a soft murmur against her ear.
Completely rigid, Sadie tried to push him away. His grip tightened in response.
“Release me!” she demanded, her voice filled with desperation.
Rain tapped softly against the windows, contrasting sharply with the charged atmosphere inside the room, laden with a tense, ambiguous intimacy.
To Noah, Sadie’s resistance seemed merely a feeble attempt to hide her true feelings for someone else.
Abruptly, he bent down and kissed her, forcing her onto the bed. The kiss was harsh, tinged with a punishing intensity, with biting and deep pulls.
Sadie, caught off guard by his sudden aggression, fought back as he gripped her firmly, refusing to let go. “Mm… release me…” she managed to gasp out.
Her efforts to push him away proved ineffective.
His overpowering kiss left her breathless, her energy fading as tears rolled down her cheeks uncontrollably.noveldrama
Feeling her tears on his skin made Noah halt, and after a brief pause, he finally let her go.
Breathing heavily, Sadie looked up at him with eyes blurred by tears, her voice shaky. “What do you take me for? You’re with Kyla. Why do you keep coming back to haunt me?”
His expression was complex. Noah felt a surge of unspeakable frustration. Without a word, he turned and strode into the bathroom, where he turned on the cold tap and let the cold water cascade over him. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 282:
The cold of the water offered Noah only temporary clarity; it did little to extinguish the persistent, unsettling heat that simmered within him. Sadie collapsed onto the floor, curled up, her face hidden in her arms as tears silently spilled down her cheeks.
Eventually, she raised her head, her eyes drawn to the bed.
The warmth of Noah’s presence lingered on the sheets, and the air was subtly tainted with a sweet, cloying scent.
A thought struck her, and she leapt up, walking briskly to the bed. She reached out, touching the sheets that radiated residual heat. Remembering the odd heat of Noah’s skin when he had held her, she wondered if perhaps he had been drugged.
Stunned by her own suspicion, Sadie considered who might drug Noah within this estate. Could Kyla be involved? That thought seemed far-fetched—they were, after all, a couple.
Why would Kyla resort to dragging Noah? Such an action seemed wholly unnecessary.
Her eyes shifted toward the bathroom, torn between the urge to check on him and her own trepidation. Noah’s unpredictable state unnerved her profoundly.
As the silence stretched from the bathroom, Sadie’s concern eventually overpowered her fears.
“Noah?” Sadie’s knock on the door was hesitant, met with silence. “Noah!” she called out more forcefully, yet the lack of response only heightened her anxiety.
With a surge of concern, she no longer held back and burst through the bathroom door.
Inside, Noah was slumped against the tiles, drenched and unconscious, with water still cascading down on him and steam clouding the air. Instinctively, Sadie clenched her teeth and mustered all her strength to pull him from the slick floor.
I@?€$? ￠tя? In ?alπ?νεl?.c?mnoveldrama
He proved far heavier than she anticipated, making each step toward the bedroom a burdensome effort.
Finally managing to get him onto the bed, Sadie caught her breath, visibly exhausted. She quickly dried him off, her eyes fixed on his closed ones as her brows knitted together in worry.
The urgent need for medical assistance became clear in her mind.
She reached for the bedside telephone, dialing the butler’s number. “Hello, this is Sadie. Could you please call the doctor? I… I need a doctor here.” Her voice shook with urgency.
“Understood, Miss Hudson. I’ll arrange it right away,” came the butler’s steady, reassuring reply.
After hanging up, Sadie remained seated by the bed, her anxiety evident as she awaited help. She frequently checked Noah’s forehead, her anxiety intensifying with each passing second.
Meanwhile, in the adjacent room, Kyla had become sleepy from the long wait. Dressed meticulously, she grew increasingly restless as Noah had not yet appeared, a sense of unease taking hold.
“Why hasn’t Noah shown up yet?” she muttered while applying another layer of makeup in front of the mirror.
Suddenly, a knock sounded from the neighboring room.
Kyla got up and opened the door. Her heart skipped a beat when she saw the butler was about to enter the neighboring room with a doctor.

###Chapter 283:
“What’s going on?” Kyla inquired, stepping closer.
“Miss Wade, Miss Hudson has requested a doctor,” the butler said. Kyla’s eyes darted to the room behind the butler, where she saw Noah lying on the bed.
“Why is Noah in Sadie’s room?” she whispered under her breath.
A sudden realization struck her, causing her to clench her fists tightly. She hurried back to her room, her pulse racing.
“Could they have found out about my plan?” Kyla wondered, her complexion turning ashen as she clutched her dress.
The butler, looking quite bewildered, entered Room 319 and paused by the door, watching as the doctor administered a sedative to Noah. Amid the commotion, Sadie was frantically trying to help him.
“Miss Hudson, please take a moment to rest. I can look after Mr. Wall,” the butler suggested.
Sadie quickly shook her head.
“I need to do this myself,” she insisted, her eyes fixed intently on Noah, without realizing it.
Recognizing her resolve, the butler stepped back without ion.noveldrama
The doctor finished his examination and confirmed that all was in order.
“Miss Hudson, Mr. Wall has only been drugged. He will be fine after some rest.”
Relief washed over Sadie, and she collapsed exhaustedly onto the edge of the bed.
“Thank you, doctor,” she murmured faintly.
Once the doctor had left, the butler departed to inform Eva of the incident.

“Drugged?” Eva set her glass of red wine aside, her lips curving into a knowing smile. “Such a crude tactic. It’s surprising Noah would be involved with a woman like that.”
After a brief pause, she commanded, “Fetch the servant who served Mr. Wall his drink.”
The butler acknowledged with a nod and quickly departed to carry out her orders.
As Eva idly played with her wine glass, her gaze drifted, deep in contemplation.
Outside, the rain continued to pour heavily, yet the warmth of the room created a cozy atmosphere.
Sadie remained seated at the edge of the bed, gently arranging the blankets around Noah. He lay there, deeply asleep, his features relaxed under the soft light, exuding a tranquility that made him appear less formidable and unexpectedly gentle.
Sadie let out a soft sigh before rising and moving to the desk. She flipped open her laptop, its screen casting a pale light that highlighted the weariness in her eyes.
Compelling herself to concentrate, she resolved to continue working—there was still a task that awaited completion. She had already completed the initial design draft; the next steps were to digitize it, apply color, and fine-tune the details.
Her fingers glided over the drawing tablet, lines emerging fluidly under her deft touch. Despite her focus, her thoughts frequently drifted to the figure resting on the bed—the man who had once held her close, yet now felt so distant. The whirlwind of emotions swirling within her was intense and defied expression.
She shook her head, attempting to clear away the distracting thoughts. Her focus needed to be sharp; her mind needed to be at peace. As time slipped away, the darkness outside gave way to the first light of dawn.

###Chapter 284:
Morning light seeped through the curtains, softly illuminating the room and revealing the untidy state of the bed.
Sadie had no idea when sleep had taken over. She woke up groggy, rubbing her stiff neck as she pushed herself upright. The laptop remained active, displaying the finalized design draft on its screen.
Relief flooded Sadie as she saw the completed draft. She had managed to finish right on schedule.
Noah was not in the room when she looked around. Apparently, he had left, which brought her a subtle comfort. The closeness they had experienced the previous night had been slightly confusing.
Carefully, Sadie closed her laptop and picked it up, ready to take it to Eva.
As she reached for the doorknob and began to turn it, the door suddenly burst open from the outside. In the doorway stood Kyla.
Seeing Sadie, Kyla raised her hand as if to strike her.
Quickly, Sadie caught Kyla’s wrist, her gaze cold. “Miss Wade, what is this behavior?”
Kyla attempted to pull her wrist away, but Sadie’s grip remained firm.noveldrama
Kyla’s eyes blazed with anger, and she bared her teeth. “Sadie, you are disgusting! You and Noah are divorced, yet you’re still chasing after him? How pathetic!”
With a mocking sneer, Sadie released Kyla’s wrist. “Miss Wade, aren’t you the disgusting one, considering you’re the mistress?”
“You—!” Kyla’s complexion blanched with fury, her finger shaking as she pointed at Sadie. “What makes you so confident? Do you think you can change how things stand? You’ll see—you’ll achieve nothing!”
Sadie chose not to continue the confrontation and turned to walk away.

“Think you can just walk away? Think again!”
In a sudden move, Kyla lunged at Sadie, shoving her aggressively. At the end of the hallway, there was a small step that Sadie hadn’t noticed. Caught off guard, she stumbled backward.
As she lost her footing, the laptop flew from her hands, tracing a parabolic path through the air before landing heavily in the rain outside the hallway.
“No!” Sadie cried out, horrified as she watched the rain drench her laptop, its screen going dark immediately.
Kyla looked on, a smug grin spreading across her face.
“Much appreciated, Sadie. Looks like Eva’s project just became mine.” With that, she turned and walked away confidently, radiating triumph.
Sadie stood frozen, her thoughts racing.
The design draft… was gone. What was she to do now?
Carefully, Sadie bent down to retrieve the laptop, drenched from the rain. Its screen remained dark, the device feeling cold and heavy—a reflection of her heavy heart.
Nearby, the hibiscus flowers shone brilliantly, revived by the rain. Their petals, dotted with dew, contrasted with the dull backdrop, their vivid hues standing out.
A spark of inspiration lit up Sadie’s eyes as she began to devise a plan.
At the same time, down the corridor, Kyla strode forward, her confident smile intact, her high heels echoing crisply against the floor. As she turned the corner, she caught sight of Noah.

###Chapter 285:
He stood by the window, engaged in a phone call, his face set in a stern expression.
“…Carry out my instructions. Tomorrow morning, I expect the secretarial team at the branch office.”
His voice was commanding as he issued orders to Samuel on the line. Kyla paused, taken aback.
Such a move usually suggested management problems at a branch office.
She hastened her steps, yet as she approached, Noah concluded his call.
“Noah…” Kyla’s voice was soft, her eyes wide with feigned naivety. “I don’t even know what I did wrong…”
As Noah faced Kyla, his gaze was piercing. “Eva has already taken care of the servant who delivered me the drink.”
Kyla’s expression twitched, the urge to defend herself rising, to assert that Sadie was the real schemer.
But before she could speak, Noah’s voice cut through with chilling finality.noveldrama
“Next time, there will be no mercy.”
As soon as he finished speaking, he turned and walked off.
Kyla remained rooted in place, her fists clenched tight.
Why did Eva have to meddle so much? And Sadie was just as bad!
Noah’s breakfast was a display of refined grace, each movement showcasing his natural poise.
Eva, resting her chin on her hand, watched him with an amused sparkle in her eyes and a cunning smile on her lips.
“You look quite lively today, Mr. Wall. Did you get some good rest last night?”

As Noah looked up, his deep eyes met hers. He replied softly, “Fairly well.”
Her laughter was gentle, yet her words carried a teasing undertone. “Only fairly well? The butler informed me you spent all night in Miss Hudson’s room and only left this morning after getting the whole story about last night,” she teased, her smile broadening for effect. “I heard you even tried not to wake Miss Hudson when you left. Looks like I’ve figured out the special someone for whom you were cooking last night.”
Noah’s grip on his knife and fork slackened briefly, and his expression grew somber, though he offered no reply.
Setting aside his cutlery, he gracefully took a napkin and dabbed at his lips.
“You seem to have quite a bit of spare time, Eva,” he said, his tone detached.
With a relaxed shrug, Eva responded, “What can I do? Life’s spectacles are too interesting to ignore, particularly yours.”
Noah then calmly took a sip of his coffee, showing no sign of irritation at Eva’s remarks.
At that moment, Kyla approached with a tablet in hand and positioned herself next to Eva.
“Ms. Shaw, I’ve received the initial designs from the branch’s design team,” Kyla said, her voice maintaining a professional softness.
Eva examined the tablet briefly.
Displayed on the screen were several lavish and garish dress designs, each excessively flattering. Beneath the images, sycophantic words praised Eva’s elegance and unmatched grace. 
.

###Chapter 286:
“It’s adequate,” Eva said blandly, handing the tablet back to Kyla. She stole a quick glance at Noah, noting his continued composure, which puzzled her.
Logically, after spending the entire night with Noah, Sadie should have been by his side by now.
Eva speculated silently. Could Noah have exhausted the poor girl last night? Yet, she maintained a poker face, casually addressing the servant nearby. “Why hasn’t Miss Hudson arrived yet?”
Eva’s abrupt inquiry about Sadie took Kyla by surprise, causing her to hesitate. Her eyes briefly met Noah’s, but noting his lack of reaction, she cautiously said, “She might have lost track of the time.”
Eva simply arched an eyebrow, her suspicions deepening. She mused that the previous night might have been more thrilling than she’d initially thought.
Leisurely, Eva took her wine glass, swirling the contents lightly while her gaze darted between Noah and Kyla, as though watching an intriguing drama unfold.
Soon, Sadie made her entrance into the dining hall. Soaked from the rain, her hair stuck to her face, and her nearly see-through white shirt accentuated her slender figure.
Despite her appearance, Sadie maintained her poise, her demeanor calm, and her presence radiantly defiant. She carried no design drafts, only a hibiscus flower, its petals dotted with raindrops that sparkled like tiny pearls.
Eva momentarily paused at the sight of Sadie entering in such a state. “Miss Hudson, what happened?” she asked, placing her wine glass down.
Sadie approached the table and delicately set the hibiscus on it, watching as the droplets formed subtle patterns on the cloth.
“This represents my design,” she said.noveldrama
€?? ￠?αt?εяs 1n ga?n?νεl?.
Kyla burst into laughter. “Sadie, is this a joke? Do you think a single flower will satisfy Ms. Shaw?”
Noah’s attention subtly shifted, his eyes lingering on Sadie with a hint of curiosity.
“The hibiscus, freshly kissed by the rain, showcases its beauty effortlessly,” Sadie responded with measured clarity, disregarding Kyla’s scoff. “Ms. Shaw’s grace mirrors the hibiscus—both are subtly vibrant and strikingly delicate. This flower embodies that spirit.”
A spark of interest flickered in Eva’s eyes. She had anticipated typical design drafts from Sadie, yet was met with the unexpected choice of a real hibiscus to symbolize her design philosophy. This bold display of creativity captivated Eva instantly.
“Fascinating…” Eva murmured, picking up the hibiscus to study it more intently, her expression one of genuine admiration.
Kyla gripped her tablet with such force that her knuckles turned white. Sadie held Noah’s attention for a moment, his expression unreadable as emotion flickered in his deep eyes.
Instead of announcing the results immediately, Eva instructed everyone to proceed with their breakfast. The mood in the dining room carried a subtle tension, everyone absorbed in private contemplations.
As the meal concluded, Eva used her napkin to dab the corner of her mouth gracefully. She looked meaningfully at Sadie and Noah before standing to leave.
Sadie followed closely behind her.
Soon, only Noah and Kyla remained in the dining hall.
Kyla was unable to contain herself any longer, her eyes brimming with tears as she approached Noah, her voice breaking. “This collaboration means so much to me, Noah. If our branch loses this project, I might lose my job. The senior staff have never taken me seriously.” 
.

###Chapter 287:
Tears glittered in her eyes as she sniffled, looking deeply distressed.
“Do you remember how I saved you—”
Cutting her off, Noah responded, “I do.”
His voice was cold, his eyes briefly showing impatience. He remembered what had happened back then, but Kyla’s repeated reminders wore on him.
Her lip caught between her teeth, Kyla yearned to speak further, yet Noah’s cold gaze silenced her.
“I’ll think about it,” he said, before turning to leave.
Kyla’s eyes lingered on his departing figure, filled with reluctance. Meanwhile, Sadie stood by a floor-to-ceiling window in the corridor, whispering into her phone.
“Alex, I’m really fine. The collaboration seems solid.” A subtle smile emerged on Sadie’s face, her voice tinged with relief.
Noah approached, pausing abruptly behind her.
Was Alex the one she was speaking to?
Feeling his presence, Sadie spun around, her surprise fleeting before she regained her calm.
Their gazes locked, the air between them charged with unease. Without a word, Noah simply gave Sadie a penetrating look, then continued on his way.
As he walked off, Sadie’s eyes followed him, her hand tightening on her phone, a trace of loneliness appearing in her gaze.
She wrapped up the call with a few light-hearted words to Alex, then hung up.
Rain slid from the eaves, forming soft ripples on the wet soil below. The view through the floor-to-ceiling window sharpened, infused with the earthy aroma of the rain.

By noon, the dining room buzzed again with the presence of diners.
Seated at the head of the table, Eva abruptly shared the news. “The Shaw Group’s project will now be managed by the Wall Group’s branch.”
The news stunned Sadie; her folder nearly slipped from her trembling hand. Disbelief filled her; Eva had complimented her design that very morning.
Across from her, Kyla’s face broke into a victorious grin, her pride evident for all to see.noveldrama
She glanced at Sadie with a challenging look, her eyes gleaming with triumph.
A heaviness overwhelmed Sadie’s heart, sinking it with disappointment. The reason eluded her.
Noah was absent from the dining room.
Kyla took her time as she walked past Sadie, her voice dropping to a murmur. “Did you hear Noah just met with Ms. Shaw? Not everything can be won by trying hard. Sometimes, you’re just meant to be a supporting player.”
After her cutting remarks, Kyla walked off, leaving Sadie to wrestle with her sense of defeat.
Trying to stay poised, Sadie inclined her head and was about to exit.
“Miss Hudson, please wait,” Eva called out, her voice reaching Sadie from behind.
Sadie halted and faced Eva, her eyes clouded with confusion.
“Yes, Ms. Shaw is quite impressed with my design concept,” she murmured into the phone.

###Chapter 288:
Placing her silver fork down, Eva inquired, “You have no ions?”
With a calm smile, Sadie responded, “I respect your decision, Ms. Shaw.” Her brief response was impactful.noveldrama
Eva’s lips curved into a playful smile, a spark of admiration in her gaze. “Your directness is refreshing, Miss Hudson.”
With a discreet nod, she signaled her assistant to fetch a document. “While the Wall Group secured the major project, I have something special for you.”
Tentatively, Sadie took the document and opened it, her eyes widening in astonishment.
It was about the jewelry design for Eva’s appearance at the Starlight event.
The document detailed every requirement Eva had for the jewelry, from the materials to the styles.
Overwhelmed, Sadie murmured, “This is… amazing.”
She looked up, her expression one of utter disbelief, her lips quivering. Eva lightly said, “Don’t disappoint me, Miss Hudson. I believe in your capabilities.”
With a wave of her hand, she instructed her assistant, “Please arrange transportation for Miss Hudson back to town.”
Holding the document close, Sadie felt a rush of emotions.
She affirmed with a firm nod and a clear voice, “I won’t disappoint you, Ms. Shaw!”
Meanwhile, Kyla approached the familiar black car, still smiling triumphantly. She attempted to open the passenger door, but it remained stubbornly closed.
Pausing, Kyla murmured, “What’s happening?” She tugged at the handle again, but the door refused to open.

A flicker of confusion crossed her face. Was the central locking system activated?
The car window slowly rolled down, revealing Noah’s chiseled face. His expression was grim, however, and his gaze was cold as ice.
“Noah?” Kyla’s smile froze, and a wave of unease surged in her heart.
Noah’s lips parted slightly as he spoke in a deep, authoritative voice. “This is the last time, Kyla.”
The words were short and few, but they left Kyla reeling. The color drained from her face, and her eyes widened in a mix of shock and confusion. “What? I’m sorry, what did you just say?”
Noah didn’t spare her another glance, nor did he address her again. Instead, he looked ahead and said to the chauffeur, “Drive.”
The black sedan sped away, leaving Kyla standing alone, hurt and bewildered. She had carefully chosen her outfit and dolled up her face, but her efforts ended up feeling like a mockery of her hopes.
She reached out without thinking, but there was nothing to grasp in front of her except the cold, empty air.
Kyla felt a chill run through her body. It left her weak and unsteady, and she found herself swaying slightly under the weight of it all.
She couldn’t process what had just happened.
Everything had been fine a few moments ago. How had it all changed so suddenly?
Noah had even gone to negotiate a deal with Eva on her behalf. Was it because of Sadie?

###Chapter 289:
Meanwhile, Sadie was sitting in the car Eva had arranged for her. Her mind was swirling with thoughts about her upcoming design project.
Ding!
Her phone chimed with a new notification. It was a message from the kindergarten teacher, reminding her that it was a school open day and that parents could pick up their children earlier than usual.
Sadie glanced at the time and asked the driver to speed up.
The car weaved through the winding mountain road and headed straight for the kindergarten. A group of children was already gathered at the entrance, likely waiting for their parents while chattering noisily.
Sadie immediately spotted Averi in the crowd. He was standing next to the teacher, all prim and obedient, even as his eyes scanned his surroundings.
“Averi!” Sadie called out, prompting the boy to turn in her direction.
His little face instantly lit up with a huge smile. He dashed over and threw himself into her arms. “Mommy!”
Sadie gathered him in a tight embrace, relishing the warmth that filled her chest. No matter how tough her situation got, Averi’s innocent smile always made everything worth it.
“Mommy, my teacher praised my drawing today!” the boy said proudly, his lips stretched into a wide grin.
“Really? That’s amazing!” Sadie smiled indulgently and ruffled his hair.
She held his hand as they walked home, chatting and laughing all the way.
They were passing by the supermarket near their apartment when Sadie made a last-minute decision to grab some groceries. She gently guided Averi inside.

“Sadie!” A familiar voice suddenly called out from behind them. Sadie turned to see Alex standing a few feet away, his face wrought with concern.
“Alex?” She blinked in surprise. “What are you doing here?”
Alex rushed over, his eyes scanning her body as if to confirm she was unharmed. After taking a moment to assess, he breathed a sigh of relief. “I was worried, so I thought I’d come and check on you.” Alex chose not to mention that he had heard Noah and Kyla had also been at the Stonemont Estate.
Sadie couldn’t help but smile. “I’m fine. I’m sorry to have made you worry, though.”
Just then, Alex’s phone buzzed. His expression changed when he saw the caller ID.
“Excuse me. I need to take this call.” He gave Sadie an apologetic smile before stepping away to answer his phone.
Sadie just nodded and took Averi into the supermarket. From Alex’s reaction, she figured something urgent had come up.
A faint sense of foreboding came over Sadie, but she brushed it aside as Averi continued with his lively prattling.
“Mommy, what are we having for dinner today?” the little boy asked, his eyes eager and hopeful.
“What would you like to eat?”
“I want glazed chicken!” Averi answered without a second’s hesitation.
“All right, glazed chicken it is!” Sadie declared, playfully pinching his cheek.noveldrama
Alex’s call didn’t take too long, and soon he was jogging back to Sadie’s side.

###Chapter 290:
“Hey, something happened at work. I need to go.”
“Okay, off you go, then. Good luck.” Sadie nodded at him in understanding.
But Alex didn’t leave right away. Instead, he gave her a long, meaningful look that lasted a moment. Then he turned on his heel and left.
Sadie watched him disappear into the crowd outside, perplexed by that lingering gaze. Another wave of unease swept over her. She shook her head, pushing that inexplicable feeling aside.
The mother and son finished their shopping and headed home. Sadie settled Averi on the sofa to watch cartoons while she went into the kitchen to start dinner.
Out of nowhere, Averi asked, “Mommy, where did you go last night?”
Sadie’s hands froze mid-movement. She had her back to the living room, so she had a few seconds to think about what to say. In the end, she replied, “I had some work to do last night.”
“Oh,” Averi replied with a hint of disappointment in his voice. “Please don’t stay out at night anymore. Okay, Mommy?”
Sadie finally put the vegetables down and walked back to the living room. She knelt in front of the sofa so that they were eye to eye.
“I promise, I’ll try to come home every night. And tonight, I will make your favorite egg custard, too. How does that sound?”
Averi’s chubby face broke into a delighted grin. “Great!”
Silence reigned in the apartment soon after dinner.
Sadie took Averi for his bath, then tucked him under the blankets before gently lulling him to sleep. It wasn’t until he was fast asleep that she quietly left the room.
gα?ησν?s?com brings your imagination alive
She walked over to her desk and opened her laptop. The bright glow of the screen illuminated her face, highlighting the traces of exhaustion that were all the more noticeable in her features.
Sadie took a deep breath and opened a design file entitled “Free Hibiscus.”
When she woke up the next morning, Sadie went through her usual routine of washing up and getting dressed. Then she padded over to Averi’s bedside.
The little guy was still sleeping soundly, his long lashes casting shadows on his chubby cheeks.
“Averi, sweetheart?” she called out softly. “Wake up. We need to go to the hospital for your checkup.”
Averi stirred. “Mommy,” he mumbled as he rubbed his eyes and stretched. “Are we going to see Dr. Archer again?”
“That’s right,” Sadie replied with a smile as she helped him out of bed to get dressed. “Once we’re done at the hospital, I’ll take you to eat something yummy.”
Less than an hour later, Jim was carefully examining Averi and taking notes on the boy’s condition post-surgery.
“He’s recovering very well, and the wound is healing up nicely too,” Jim said as he set his stethoscope down. “This little warrior is pretty tough.”noveldrama
“Thank you, Dr. Archer.” Sadie sighed in relief, feeling a burden lift from her shoulders.
“Mommy, may I have ice cream?” Averi chirped as soon as they stepped out of the consultation room.
Sadie thought about it for a while. “Well, a little bit wouldn’t hurt.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 291:
“Yay!” Averi squealed in excitement.
A while later, Averi was holding his ice cream as if it were a precious treasure. He savored every lick, and his eyes twinkled with delight.
Sadie’s heart was filled with warmth and affection as she watched her son enjoy the simple things in life.
“Mommy, look!” Averi suddenly pointed at the television propped up in the hospital lobby. “Look at that man!”
On the screen was the live broadcast of a press conference for the Wall Group. Noah looked as dashing as ever in his tailored suit as he stood on the platform, addressing the media.
Sadie felt her heart clench. Yesterday’s events came rushing back in full force, replacing her earlier joy with bitter resentment.
She turned away from the screen and her son. She couldn’t let Averi see her misery.
At that same moment, Kyla was limping out of the emergency area.
She had to walk down the mountain in her high heels after Noah left her, and her feet ended up getting cuts and blisters. She had no choice but to seek treatment at the hospital.
“Damn that Sadie! Why is it her again?” Kyla muttered under her breath, her anger flaring once more as she spotted Sadie and Averi in the distance.
But before she could do anything about it, her phone rang.
“Kyla, come to Wall Manor for dinner tonight. Nigel wants to host a family dinner,” Isabel said kindly through the phone.
“Sure thing! I’ll be there,” Kyla replied as cheerfully as she could under the circumstances. After hanging up, she threw one last seething glare in Sadie’s direction, then limped out of the hospital.
Feel inspired by g?lnσν?s?
Kyla was determined to make a good impression on the Wall family during tonight’s dinner. If she won Nigel over and gained his approval, her social status would rise significantly.
Sadie waited until Averi finished his ice cream, then they left the hospital hand in hand.
They were by the entrance when a sleek, black Maybach pulled up in front of them. Sadie acted on reflex, stepping in front of Averi and blocking him from view.
The car window rolled down to reveal Noah’s handsome face. The mere sight of him brought all the anger and frustration she felt rising to the surface.
The way Noah had pulled strings for Kyla the previous day was still painfully fresh in Sadie’s mind.
Well, she couldn’t blame him, since the two were a couple, after all.
“Get in,” Noah ordered in his signature domineering tone.
Sadie gritted her teeth and inhaled sharply. “What do you want from me, Mr. Wall?” she asked icily.
Noah’s brows furrowed. He didn’t like her attitude at all. “My grandfather wants you to come over for dinner.”
Sadie froze. It had been three years. She had no idea how Nigel was doing these days.
The old man had always treated her well and cherished her like he would his own granddaughter.
Sadie felt her heart soften, if only a little.

###Chapter 292:
Sadie’s heart softened a little.
A mix of emotions clouded her eyes. “Well…”
“I’ll have the driver take Averi home,” Noah offered. He had sensed her hesitation and chose to make the decision for her.
Sadie hesitated some more, but eventually nodded.
She leaned down and stroked Averi’s hair. “Sweetheart, we will drop you off first, okay? I’ll be home later.”
Averi obediently agreed.
After dropping off Averi and making sure he was safely inside his apartment, the car drove toward the suburbs.
No one spoke throughout the journey, and the air inside the car grew so thick it was almost suffocating.
At last, the car pulled over in front of Wall Manor.
Sadie hadn’t even stepped out of the vehicle yet, but she was already overcome with a heavy sense of foreboding.
The intricately carved wooden gate and the massive courtyard were a testament to the Wall family’s obscene wealth.
They entered the manor and found Isabel chatting warmly with Kyla in the living room. The two women were smiling from ear to ear, painting a perfect picture of a close mother-daughter relationship.
The moment Isabel spotted Sadie, however, her expression turned icy.
“Noah, why did you bring that cursed woman here? Outsiders are not welcome at our family gathering!”

Beside her, Kyla was also fuming with resentment.
She had called Noah before coming to the Wall Manor, but it was Samuel who had picked up. He told her that Noah had other matters to attend to and couldn’t come to the phone, so Kyla had driven there all by herself.
Despite her frustrations, she deftly kept up the act.
Taking Isabel’s hand, she said, “Don’t be upset. I’m sure Sadie is just worried about Nigel’s health…”
But Isabel shoved Kyla’s hand away and glared at Sadie. “Who cares about what she thinks! Get her out of here, right this instant!”
Sadie was no pushover. She opened her mouth to defend herself when a deep, commanding voice suddenly boomed. “I’d like to see who dares to throw my granddaughter-in-law out!”
With the help of the butler, Nigel slowly descended the stairs. Despite his bowed figure, he still exuded an aura of unmistakable authority. Just like that, Isabel’s outburst fizzled out, and what followed was an awkward silence.noveldrama
Quick as a flash, Kyla rushed forward to support Nigel. “Please be careful on the stairs,” she said in a sickly sweet tone.
Unfortunately for her, the old man was having none of her antics. He shook off her arm as though disgusted by her touch. “You are not part of our family. What are you doing here?”
Isabel’s expression tightened. “Nigel,” she hurriedly explained. “Kyla and Noah—”
“Know your place,” Nigel barked, pointing a finger at Kyla, then at Isabel. “And enough with your schemes! Sadie is the only granddaughter-in-law I will acknowledge. No one else will take her place!”
Sadie froze at that, though her heart was pounding furiously inside her chest.

###Chapter 293:
She never imagined that Nigel still held her in such high regard after three years.
She felt a wave of warmth inside her, and tears suddenly sprang to her eyes.
“How are you, Nigel?” Sadie asked as she stepped forward, her voice laced with concern.
Nigel turned away from her with a huff, clearly feigning annoyance. “You wayward girl! It’s been ages since you’ve come to see me. If I didn’t know any better, I might have thought you’d forgotten all about me!”
“Of course not,” Sadie quickly replied in a placating tone. “I was just busy with work. Once things have settled down, I’ll be sure to visit more often. I promise, okay?”
“Humph!” Nigel stubbornly kept on with his act, even as a smile began tugging at the corners of his mouth. “That’s more like it, I suppose.”noveldrama
Standing off to the side, Kyla seethed as she watched their affectionate interaction.
She had spent the last three years going out of her way to win Nigel’s favor. She had sent him carefully chosen health supplements and expensive gifts—none of them cheap! And yet, not once had she received a kind word from him.
Sadie, on the other hand, just had to say a few words, and the old man was practically beaming. How was that fair?!
Kyla’s hands clenched into fists.
Noah cleared his throat then, breaking the ice. “Is dinner ready yet?”
One of the servants immediately peeled himself from the wall and bowed. “Yes, Mr. Wall. The table has been set.”

Hearing this, Nigel grabbed Sadie’s hand and pulled her to the dining room. He didn’t even spare Noah a glance.
“Just look at you, my dear! You’ve lost so much weight!” Nigel examined Sadie, his gaze worried yet tender at the same time. He turned to the butler and said, “Fetch all my health supplements and have them sent to the Myrtlewood Estate, so that Noah can take good care of Sadie!”
When he turned his attention back to Sadie, his gaze fell on her flat stomach.
“You two have been married for so many years now,” Nigel said with heartfelt sincerity. “It’s about time you have a child together.”
Sadie felt her cheeks burn at that, and her heart picked up its pace again.
Instead of answering, she picked up the serving spoon and placed a piece of fish on Nigel’s plate. “Please try this!”
Isabel and Kyla quietly observed from the side, noting how much Nigel cared about Sadie. Their faces soured at the sight.
The meal proceeded in silence for the two women, the food tasting like tasteless dust in their mouths.
After they had eaten, Nigel said decisively, “Sadie, let’s visit the memorial hall.”
Isabel’s expression shifted dramatically when she heard this. Despite her many years as a member of the Wall family, she had never been invited to the memorial hall. What made Sadie so special?
Overcome with emotion, Isabel interjected, “Nigel, are you sure…?”
Nigel’s stern look quickly silenced her.
He then took Sadie by the hand and rose from his seat. “Gabriel, join us,” he commanded Gabriel Black, the butler.

###Chapter 294:
Ignoring Noah completely, Nigel led the way. Noah’s expression darkened slightly, signaling his desire to speak up, though he chose to remain silent.
Confusion clouded Sadie’s thoughts as well. The memorial hall was a revered place dedicated to the Wall family’s ancestors. Given her and Noah’s impending divorce, her presence there seemed out of place, even improper.
Nigel held her hand firmly, his warmth providing Sadie with a surprising sense of comfort.
On several occasions, Sadie nearly shared the news of her impending divorce from Noah. Yet, each time she glanced at his fragile form, the words stalled in her throat.
Positioned just behind Wall Manor, the memorial hall was a venerable structure that radiated dignity and age, typical of the family’s longstanding heritage.
As they neared, a subtle scent of sandalwood filled the air, its solemn fragrance setting the tone for the visit.
Inside the hall, soft lighting illuminated many photos, adding to the reverent mood.
Quietly, Nigel gestured toward a specific photo and murmured, “Sadie, please, come see this.”
Following his instruction, Sadie moved closer. As her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she could discern the name inscribed on the frame.
Absolon Stewart.
Sadie expressed her astonishment.
“Is this my grandfather?” Her eyes widened in disbelief, and she turned to Nigel. A torrent of shock overwhelmed her. How could her grandfather’s photo end up in the Wall family’s memorial hall?
Every story starts at galn ovels ; comnoveldrama
Nigel released a weary sigh. “Absolon was my dearest friend during our college days,” he explained.
He paused, a distant look crossing his face. “We bumped into each other unexpectedly after we had finished our studies. By that time, he had become a distinguished financial expert, highly respected, while the Wall Group was facing serious difficulties. It was Absolon who assisted in resolving the turmoil at Wall Group. He eventually became a member of our board of directors.”
Nigel’s eyes revealed a mix of emotions as he spoke.
“Our paths diverged after a series of disagreements, leading him to resign from the board.”
Listening in silence, Sadie felt a tumult of emotions stirring within her. Laura had never shared any of these details about her grandfather.
“Life often deals us harsh cards,” Nigel said, his voice laden with grief as he shook his head. “Absolon died not long after our parting. He was a genuine friend, and his passing has left a wound in my heart that no amount of time can heal.”
Nigel took a deep breath, then continued, “Later, Absolon’s daughter, your mother, married into the Hudson family, who later faced bankruptcy. Then, Absolon’s only remaining descendant, his granddaughter, joined our Wall family through marriage five years ago.”
“The intricacies of these events are known only to a select few within the company, myself included. Noah also remains unaware.”
Stunned, Sadie finally understood why Nigel had been so insistent on her marriage to Noah five years ago. It was all beginning to make sense.
With a look blending compassion and determination, Nigel then turned to Sadie and asked, “Sadie, do you remember I wanted to transfer some shares to you three years ago?” 
.

###Chapter 295:
Sadie gave a nod. “Yes, I do recall that.” She had dismissed it as a fleeting fancy of his at the time and hadn’t given it much thought.
“My time is running short,” Nigel said, his voice laden with gravity as he clutched his cane more firmly. “Noah has a habit of rash decisions. You’ve matured, Sadie. The shares originally belonging to Absolon were always intended for you.”
The gravity of his statement overwhelmed Sadie, rendering her speechless for a moment.
Nigel then addressed Gabriel, saying, “Gabriel, please arrange a meeting with our legal team and start preparing the necessary paperwork. Make sure it remains confidential.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” responded Gabriel, nodding respectfully.
“I’ll inform you once everything is set,” Nigel added, his eyes alight with anticipation as he looked at Sadie.
With a numb nod, Sadie struggled to process the news.
After a prolonged silence, she finally mustered the courage to speak, her voice shaky. “Nigel, do you have any information about where my parents might be?”
Nigel shook his head and responded, “I’ve dispatched search parties, yet we’ve heard nothing back.” He let out a deep sigh.
Feeling drained, he said, “I need to rest now, Sadie. Please, take a moment to speak to your grandfather. I will excuse myself.”
Sadie lingered in the memorial hall for what felt like an eternity before finally dragging herself back to the living room. Her mind was a storm of tangled thoughts, each one colliding with the next.
As she reached the center of the room, a figure stepped into her path—Isabel.
Freshly uploaded on gα?ησv?s?com
Arms crossed, her sharp eyes cut through Sadie like a blade. “What exactly did Nigel drag you to the memorial hall for?”
Sadie had no interest in engaging and tried to sidestep her. But before she could slip past, Isabel’s hand clamped down on her arm with startling force.
“Is this what passes for manners where you come from?” Isabel sneered, her grip tightening. “I asked you a question.”
Pain shot through Sadie’s arm, and with a sharp tug, she wrenched herself free. “What Nigel and I discuss is none of your business.”
Isabel’s face twisted in fury, her hand trembling as she pointed at Sadie, words failing her. “Don’t think Nigel’s favor gives you free rein to do as you please!”
Isabel spat, her voice dripping with contempt. “What makes you think you’re worthy of being part of the Wall family? Do you actually believe you deserve Noah?”
Sadie met her glare with an unsettling calm, her eyes cold and unreadable. “There is nothing between Noah and me,” she said, her voice steady. “And there never will be.”
At that moment, Noah descended the staircase, his usual air of cool detachment vanishing the instant he caught Sadie’s words. His expression darkened, a storm brewing behind his eyes.
Trailing just behind him was Kyla, her soft yellow dress flowing effortlessly around her as she took in the unfolding scene with an amused smirk.
Sadie, unbothered by the thickening tension, strode toward the front door without a backward glance.
Noah’s gaze followed her retreating figure, his jaw tightening, his hands curling into fists.

###Chapter 296:
Sensing the shift in her son’s demeanor, Isabel clutched his arm. “Noah, Sadie and Nigel were in the memorial hall for quite some time. Could it be… was it about the shares transfer?”
Noah wrenched free from her grasp, his gaze turning icily sharp. “My business is none of your concern. And don’t forget—she’s still my wife.” With that, he strode toward the door.
Each step was heavy with intent. Kyla blinked in surprise, watching him brush past her without so much as a glance.
Panic flashed across her face, and she hurried after him. “Noah! Wait for me!”
But he didn’t pause, not even acknowledging her voice.
Kyla came to an abrupt halt, frustration twisting her features as she stomped her foot on the floor.
The night breeze carried a quiet chill.
Sadie stepped past the towering gates of Wall Manor. She reached for her phone, intending to call a cab—only to realize the futility of it.
The Wall Manor was isolated, surrounded by endless stretches of private roads and towering trees. Walking out on foot would be an ordeal.
She stood there, unsure of what to do, when the sound of measured footsteps echoed behind her.
She stilled. She didn’t need to turn around to know who it was.
“What did you mean just now, Sadie?” Noah’s voice was low, taut with barely restrained anger.
Sadie turned, meeting his gaze with cool indifference.
“Exactly what I said. Or are you struggling with basic comprehension, Mr. Wall?”
g ? ln σ ν ?s?com hosts great fiction
Noah’s jaw tensed. “You’d better be very clear about what you’re implying.”
Sadie let out a short, humorless laugh, her expression turning icier. “Oh, I’m crystal clear, unlike some people, who prefer to live in delusion.”
Her words sliced through the space between them, sharp and unyielding.
“You’ve already helped Kyla secure the deal with Shaw Group. What else do you want?”
Noah’s expression darkened, his jaw tightening. Before Sadie could step away, he seized her wrist in one swift motion.noveldrama
She inhaled sharply, a flicker of pain flashing across her face, but she refused to lower her gaze.
“What’s wrong, Mr. Wall?” she said, her voice laced with mockery. “Did I strike a nerve? You’ll do anything for Kyla, no matter who gets hurt. Tell me—what part of that isn’t true?”
Noah’s fingers unconsciously tightened around her wrist. His eyes locked onto hers, turbulent and unreadable. He wanted to deny it, but nothing came out.
Sadie struggled, her frustration mounting.
“Let go of me!” she snapped, her voice trembling with anger.
Noah didn’t respond. Instead, he pulled her toward the sleek black Maybach parked by the curb.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Sadie’s voice sharpened, a flash of unease flickering in her eyes.
Still silent, Noah yanked open the car door and pushed her inside before climbing in after her.
“Drive,” he ordered, his voice cold. 
.

.
###Chapter 297:
The driver hesitated only for a split second before obeying, not daring to question the command.
Sadie stared out the window as the car sped through the quiet roads, the estate fading into the distance. Slowly, she forced herself to steady her breathing, knowing she needed to pick her battles.
The ride was steeped in tension, the silence between them stretching unbearably.
Finally, as the city skyline loomed ahead, Sadie saw her moment.
“Stop the car,” her voice was firm, unwavering. “Whatever point you’re trying to make, it ends here. I can get home just fine on my own, Mr. Wall.”
Noah’s gaze flicked toward her, cold and unreadable. He said nothing. The driver hesitated, eyes darting to Noah through the rearview mirror, unsure whether to follow the order.
Sadie’s stomach twisted. Something wasn’t right.noveldrama
The city lights blurred past as the car moved farther and farther from the subway station. Panic gripped her. Averi was waiting at home—she needed to get back.
“I said stop the car!” Sadie’s voice sharpened, laced with anger. She pounded against the door. “Let me out!”
Noah’s expression darkened further, his silence more unsettling than words. Outside, the towering silhouette of the Howe Group’s headquarters loomed closer.
Noah finally spoke, his voice cold and cutting. “Is Alex really that important to you?”
Sadie’s breath hitched. She clenched her fists, frustration boiling over as she met his gaze with burning defiance.
“Yes!” she blurted out, her eyes reddening with unspoken emotion.
“He’s very important to me.”
As soon as those words left Sadie’s mouth, Noah pulled her to him with such force that it knocked the wind out of her.
Shock widened Sadie’s eyes as she looked at the man before her, puzzled by his sudden aggression.
Noah panted heavily, his chest rising and falling rapidly. His stormy, unreadable gaze bored into hers.
He suddenly bowed his head and captured her lips with a punishing kiss.
The kiss was overpowering and fierce, filled with a punitive intensity, as if he sought to devour her.
Sadie attempted to free herself, pushing against him, but his unyielding arms held her tightly, making her struggles ineffective.
The driver, witnessing the scene in the rearview mirror, was so shocked that he promptly averted his gaze. He silently activated the privacy screen, enclosing them in a secluded, intimate space. Only the subdued sounds of Sadie’s restrained cries and Noah’s labored breathing filled the car.
The atmosphere was laden with an evident tension, tinged with a confused, almost sensual energy.
A soft whimper of pain escaped Sadie, and she suddenly became aware of her predicament.
In a desperate move, she bit down on Noah’s lip, tasting the sharp flavor of blood that quickly spread between them. 
.

.
###Chapter 298:
Noah groaned in pain and instantly let her go.
In the heat of the moment, Sadie quickly raised her hand and landed a resounding slap across his face. The sound, “Pak!” echoed starkly within the car’s confines. Silence immediately enveloped them. Upon hearing the slap, the driver instantly became rigid, his breath held in anxious anticipation.
The force of the slap turned Noah’s head aside, leaving a stark red mark from Sadie’s palm on his cheek.
He slowly turned his head back toward her, his face revealing layers of shock mingled with a darker, more sinister emotion.
Sadie’s breathing was heavy; her body vibrated with the intensity of her emotions.
“Stop the car right now, or I’ll jump out!” she shouted, her voice quivering with intense anger.
A brief softness passed over Noah’s features, pain momentarily flickering in his eyes as he met her gaze. His hoarse voice broke the tension. “Stop the car.”noveldrama
Relieved, the driver quickly maneuvered the vehicle to the roadside. As soon as the door unlocked, Sadie leapt from the car, dashing toward the subway station, never once glancing back.
Noah’s gaze followed her resolute departure. With chilling indifference, he murmured, “You’ll regret this, mark my words.”
A brief hesitation interrupted Sadie’s stride, a cold dread creeping up on her. Yet, she continued her sprint to the subway station, her determination steadfast.
Meanwhile, the sleek black Maybach merged back into traffic, vanishing among the stream of vehicles.
In the soft light cast by the bedside lamp, Sadie quietly closed the door to Averi’s room. Averi lay on the bed, peacefully asleep with his cheeks flushed and his eyelashes casting delicate shadows over his features. She exhaled a gentle sigh and approached the bed to snugly tuck the quilt around him.
Your story hub g?lnσν?s?com
In his slumber, Averi mumbled, “Mommy,” his tiny fingers gripping the quilt’s edge.
Pain pricked Sadie’s heart as the memory of the recent event in Noah’s car replayed, raw and unfiltered.
She reflexively touched her cheeks, as a surge of bitterness welled up within her.
At the same time, the atmosphere at Howe Manor was thick with tension.
“Alex, be honest with me. Do you truly want to be with Sadie?” Susannah asked, her voice quivering with frustration and her eyes reflecting a blend of despair and disappointment.
Alex remained seated on the sofa, his expression tense, his brows knitted together in silence.
“You’ve ignored my calls repeatedly these last few days,” Susannah continued, her voice escalating with a hint of a sob. “Do you still regard me as your mother? Look at your…”
“Actions! You’re always at her place, even picking up her child from school. What are you trying to prove? You’re the heir to the Howe family, yet here you are, playing stepfather to another man’s child. Can’t you see how much disgrace you’re bringing upon our family?”
“Mom, I understand the implications of my choices,” Alex said, his voice composed yet determined.
“Do you really think you know what you’re doing?” Susannah sprang up, her tone incisive. “You’re ready to abandon your family for her?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 299:
At that instant, Alex’s assistant entered swiftly, his face marked by a look of grave concern. “Mr. Howe, we’ve got serious problems!”
Turning in alarm, Alex and Susannah faced him.
Panting slightly, the assistant explained, “It’s about our partnerships… They’re withdrawing. Even those who have been with us for decades are now backing away…”
Color drained from Susannah’s face. “What? Why? What’s happening?”
“I tried to understand the partners’ perspective…” The assistant’s voice faded with each word. “They mentioned… Mr. Wall has directed them accordingly. They fear offending him…”
“Noah Wall?” Disbelief etched itself across Susannah’s face as she turned to Alex, her eyes wide with astonishment. “Alex, is there a rift between you two?”
Susannah remembered that Alex and Noah had been close since childhood, almost like brothers.
Alex rose abruptly, his expression darkening. His lips formed a tight line, his jaw set firmly. He walked swiftly toward the door.
“Alex, where are you headed?” Susannah’s voice cracked as she called out to him. Alex didn’t reply. He yanked the door open and vanished into the night.
“Alex! Don’t go!” Susannah’s plea echoed behind him, tinged with desperation.
However, Alex accelerated instead of stopping.
As he exited, the grand gates of Howe Manor closed with a definitive bang, sending a shudder through Susannah’s heart.
Overcome with emotion, she sank into the sofa, her complexion ashen, her gaze empty.
The behavior of Noah was extraordinarily suspect. Something hidden had to be at play.

She called out to the butler, who quickly appeared. “What do you need, Mrs. Howe?”
“Call Claud Glyn, the private investigator, at once!”noveldrama
Firm in her resolve to uncover the truth, Susannah waited expectantly. With a brief nod, the butler responded, “Understood, Mrs. Howe.” He departed hastily, wasting no time.
Sadie had no clue about what had transpired.
For days, she had been buried in work, pouring every ounce of energy into the design drafts for the Starlight Gala. She had pushed herself to the brink—so much so that even remembering to breathe felt like a luxury.
Now, after countless sleepless nights, her eyes were bloodshot, and her complexion ghostly pale.
The desk was a battlefield of discarded sketches, crumpled like fallen soldiers. Empty coffee cups were stacked precariously, a sign of her exhaustion.
But at last—it was done.
Her hands trembled slightly as she carefully placed the finalized drafts into a folder. A long breath escaped her lips, heavy with relief. Without wasting another second, she climbed into her newly acquired black SUV and headed toward Stonemont Estate.
It had been a long time since she returned to Helva, and she had finally managed to renew her driver’s license.
At Whitewood Estate, sunlight poured over the lush grounds, the air carrying the faint, sweet scent of blooming flowers.

###Chapter 300:
Inside, Eva lounged on the sofa in a silk robe as vibrant as her personality.
With lazy elegance, she swirled the amber liquid in her wine glass, watching Sadie approach with a glint of amusement. “Well, well, well. Look who is here—our star designer.”
Setting down her glass, Eva took the folder from Sadie’s hands, her eyes flickering over the exhausted woman before her.
“What have you done to yourself these past few days?” Eva clicked her tongue. “Honestly, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think Mr. Wall was mistreating you.”
Sadie let out a faint, weary smile—one that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Ms. Shaw, Mr. Wall and I have nothing to do with each other.”
Eva said nothing at first, leisurely flipping through the pages, her slender fingers tapping against the paper now and then.
The room was silent, save for the soft rustling of sheets as she took her time examining the designs.
Sadie stood motionless, palms slightly damp, watching every flicker of Eva’s expression, every subtle movement.
“Elegant. Fresh.” Eva glanced up, a glimmer of approval in her eyes. “Like the first bloom of spring.” She closed the folder with a satisfied hum. “You’ve outdone yourself, Sadie. These designs are breathtaking—exactly what this year’s Starlight Gala needs.”
Then Eva’s lips curled into a smirk. “Let’s move forward with this.”
Relief crashed over Sadie, tension melting from her shoulders.
“Thank you, Ms. Shaw,” Sadie said, her voice steady with gratitude. “I’ll ensure everything is flawless.”
Find what you love at g?lnσν?s?
Eva rose gracefully and stepped closer, resting her hand on Sadie’s shoulder.
“I never doubted you,” she said, her voice smooth as silk. “Keep it up. I expect great things from you.”
Then, with a knowing smile, she added, “But do try to take better care of yourself. A woman should never let work rob her of her glow.” She lifted her wine glass, taking a languid sip, her gaze drifting toward the window, as if lost in thought.
Sadie stepped out of the estate, her heart lighter than when she arrived. But just as she reached her car, a sharp, mocking voice sliced through the air.
“Well, well… look who it is. What are you doing here? Taking a scenic stroll?”
Sadie stilled, her expression cooling as she turned toward the voice. Not far away, Kyla stood with a folder tucked under her arm, a smug smirk playing on her lips.noveldrama
Clad in a perfectly tailored business suit that accentuated her figure, she might have looked poised and elegant—if not for the malice darkening her expression.
Sadie’s brows furrowed slightly. She was puzzled by Kyla’s persistent hostility. She had already stepped aside from Noah’s life. What more did Kyla want?
Maintaining her composure, Sadie asked coolly, “Miss Wade, is there something you need?”
Kyla scoffed, closing the distance between them, her gaze sharp with provocation.
“Some people are so self-absorbed,” she said with a sneer. “Poor Alex—he’s given everything, only to end up saving an ungrateful bastard.” With that, Kyla swept past Sadie, head held high, her heels clicking against the pavement as she strode toward the estate. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 301:
Sadie stood frozen.
Alex?
Ungrateful bastard?
What was Kyla talking about?
A sudden wave of unease coiled in Sadie’s stomach.
Her fingers instinctively tightened around her phone.
Without hesitation, she dialed Alex’s number.noveldrama
“Beep… beep… beep…” The ringing droned in her ear, each second stretching unbearably.
No answer. Sadie’s pulse quickened, her grip on the phone tightening. She redialed. Again. And again. Each call met with the same cold silence.
“Alex… what’s going on with you?” Sadie whispered, her voice trembling as worry drained the color from her face.
She couldn’t just barge into Howe Group.
That would only upset Susannah.
Forcing herself to breathe deeply, she knew she needed to understand what had happened before taking action.
She marched over to her car, pulled open the door, and slid into the driver’s seat.
The engine roared to life, and the black SUV tore away from Stonemont Estate, speeding toward her studio.
Inside the car, Sadie’s grip on the steering wheel was unyielding, her knuckles turning ghostly white.
The tension radiated from her in waves as Kyla’s taunting words echoed relentlessly in her mind. What the hell happened to Alex?

As Sadie swung open the door to her studio, a tense silence enveloped her.
The typically lively studio was unnervingly quiet. A handful of employees whispered among themselves, their faces etched with tension and unease.
“Miss Hudson…” A young designer approached her hesitantly, a piece of paper gripped tightly in his hand. “I’m resigning.”
Caught off guard, Sadie took the resignation letter from him. Before she could even look at it, several more employees came forward, presenting their own letters.
Their expressions were uneasy, and their eyes darted around. Clearly, they were holding back words they couldn’t quite bring themselves to say.
“I’m resigning too, Miss Hudson.”
“I’m sorry, Miss Hudson.”
Within minutes, the studio had cleared out, leaving only a few behind. Holding a stack of resignation letters, Sadie felt a surge of inexplicable discomfort.
“What is happening? Why is everyone leaving?” Sadie tried to stifle the panic welling up inside her and inquired as calmly as possible.
“Miss Hudson, there’s really no option left for us,” an older designer said with a heavy sigh.
“We’ve just secured a deal with Shaw Group, and our partnership with Lawrence Group is ongoing. But still, you…”
The remaining staff exchanged looks, their eyes filled with defeat. “In any case, we can’t stick around any longer.”

###Chapter 302:
With these words, they all bowed their heads and hurried out of the studio, leaving Sadie alone in the suddenly deserted space, feeling like she was caught in a surreal moment.
The clock on the wall continued its relentless ticking, each second stretching out endlessly.
Noticing the time, Sadie remembered Averi would soon be out of school.
Gathering her strength, she grabbed her car keys and headed out.
Sadie drove mechanically, her mind a chaotic mess.
Upon reaching the vicinity of the kindergarten, she parked and walked towards the entrance, lost in thought.
“Beep!” The sharp sound of a horn rang out.
Jolted back to the present, Sadie saw a truck barreling toward her.noveldrama
She froze, attempting to stop, but it was too late.
“Argh!” Just then, a strong arm pulled her back forcefully, saving her in the nick of time.
Her heart raced as she staggered backward, nearly losing her balance. Tina’s familiar features came into view as she lifted her gaze.
“Are you out of your mind, Sadie? What were you thinking?” Tina’s concern was evident in her wide eyes and the rapid rise and fall of her chest.
In a daze, Sadie could only stare back, her mind wiped clean of thoughts. The fear of death had gripped her just moments before.
“Tina, I owe you my life,” Sadie said, her voice trembling and her complexion pale as she clutched at her chest.
Tina looked exhausted, rubbing her sore eyes as she grumbled, “How could you be so careless, Sadie? You frightened me to death. I’ve been working overtime so much lately I’m barely standing, and when I finally have a day off, I nearly end up planning your funeral.”
L?tt chαpt?rs ιn glnov?l.m
A faint smile crossed Sadie’s face. “I’m really sorry, Tina. It’s just that I’ve been out of sorts.”
“That’s quite clear,” Tina responded, her lips pursed in a frown as she gave Sadie a worried once-over.
“Are you okay? What’s going on with you? You’re looking awful, and those dark circles? They might as well be bruises.”
Sadie sighed. “My studio’s in chaos. Everyone quit, and I can’t get in touch with Alex.”
“Your design studio?” Tina’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion. “What? How did that happen? You secured the Starlight Gala project recently, right?”
“Yeah, that was before everything fell apart,” Sadie murmured, her expression growing more somber.
“And what brings you here, anyway?” Tina’s gaze swept their surroundings, her tone laced with curiosity.
Pointing toward the nearby kindergarten, Sadie replied, “I’m here to pick up Averi from school.”
“Ah, that explains it,” Tina said, a light of understanding dawning in her eyes.
“I actually live nearby. And, by the way…” she whispered, leaning closer. “I’ve heard something interesting. It appears the Wall Group is planning to take over the Howe Group.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 303:
“What? Can you repeat that?” Sadie stood rooted to the spot, feeling as though she had been doused with cold water, chilling her to the bone. “How could that be? The Howe family and the Wall family have been close for generations, and the Howe family isn’t exactly powerless…”
Tina gave a confused shrug. “Who can say? The motives of those at the top are often a mystery.”
Suppressing a yawn and blinking back tears, Tina murmured, “I’ve got to get some sleep. I’m exhausted.”
With a wave of her hand, Tina departed, leaving Sadie alone with her thoughts swirling.
Could the Wall Group really be aiming to acquire the Howe Group?
How could this be happening?
She was unable to get in touch with Alex… Was it linked to Noah somehow?
The chill of the wind, now mingled with light rain, whipped across Sadie’s face, snapping her back to reality.
The Wall Group’s potential takeover of the Howe Group, the resignation of her staff… It all seemed to converge on a single, ominous point.
Inside, Sadie fought to contain the turmoil swirling within her.
“Is all this happening because of me?” she muttered to herself. She suddenly recalled what happened in Noah’s car, his chilling words echoing in her mind. “Sadie, you’ll regret this. Mark my words…”noveldrama
Only then did she grasp the full picture. It was because she had refused his “generosity.”
Was Noah seeking vengeance against her and Alex?
Let your imagination soar with gα?ησν?s．?ο
A sharp pang constricted Sadie’s chest, as though her heart was being wrung, rendering her breathless. “No, I must uncover the truth.”
Gritting her teeth, Sadie pulled out her phone and quickly dialed a number.
“Look into the staff who left my studio. I need to know where they’ve gone.”
The waiting period seemed endless.
Ten minutes passed before her phone started ringing.
“Miss Hudson, we’ve found out. All your former employees have moved to Wall Group.”
This was exactly what Sadie had suspected. Her grip on the phone tightened, her knuckles blanching.
Anger began to swell in her chest, threatening to consume her.
Meanwhile, the sound of the kindergarten bell pierced the air, marking the day’s end as children’s laughter filled the background.
Seeing Sadie at the edge of the crowd, Averi dashed over on his tiny legs and leapt into her arms, exclaiming, “Mommy!”
With effort, Sadie mustered a smile and embraced her son with all her might.
“Mommy, are you okay? You seem sad,” said Averi, his small hand tenderly caressing her face.
“I’m fine, sweetheart. Mommy’s just feeling a bit worn out,” Sadie reassured him, holding back her tears as she kissed his forehead.
Once they were home, Sadie passed Averi to Carol.
She quickly relayed some instructions and then rushed out. Finding Noah was imperative. She was determined to confront him and demand the truth.

###Chapter 304:
The SUV hurtled down the city streets before halting sharply in front of the towering structure of Wall Group.
Exiting the vehicle, Sadie marched into the lavish lobby.
“I need to see Noah Wall,” she said decisively to the receptionist.
“Is there an appointment scheduled, ma’am?” the receptionist inquired courteously.
“I haven’t made one,” Sadie replied.
“Unfortunately, ma’am, Mr. Wall is currently out of the office.”
Out of the office?
A wave of disappointment washed over Sadie. Then, a specific location popped into her mind.
Considering Noah wasn’t at his office, it was likely he could be at that particular place.
Without a moment’s delay, Sadie turned and exited the Wall Group building.
As the rain poured, the SUV raced through the nighttime streets.
Her phone buzzed, displaying “Alex” as the caller ID.
With a shaky hand, Sadie picked up the call. “Hello, Alex…”
“Sadie? You don’t sound like yourself. What’s the matter?” Alex’s voice came through, as kind as always, yet unmistakably weary.
“Alex, are you all right?” Sadie’s voice wavered as she spoke. “I’ve heard about Noah causing problems for Howe Group…”
“It’s just a small setback, Sadie. I’ve got it under control,” Alex interrupted, his tone artificially light. “What’s up? Why did you call?”
“Alex…” Sadie struggled to hold back her tears. “I’m sorry. It seems I’ve pulled you and the Howe family into this mess…”
?tｅt ? ? gαlnovels.ｃοm
“Don’t talk like that,” Alex responded gently. “You’re not to blame here. Business is just business. Don’t worry about it too much. I’ll handle everything.”
“Alex, I promise I’ll find a solution. I won’t let you or the Howe family suffer.”
Three years ago, Alex had been her savior in a car accident.
Now, as the Howe family faced destruction from Noah, Sadie couldn’t simply be a bystander.
After she hung up the phone, Sadie shut her eyes briefly.
Myrtlewood Estate had once felt like a prison to her. Now, she was forced to walk through its doors once more.
The SUV pulled up to the gates of Myrtlewood Estate. Sadie exited the vehicle and made her way forward.
The rain persisted.
At the entrance, Samuel waited with a black umbrella, acknowledging her with a subtle nod.
“Good evening, Mrs. Wall. Mr. Wall is waiting for you,” he said, his voice even, suggesting that all was proceeding as he had expected.
With a cold look, Sadie passed by him without a word.
Internally, she scoffed. What was this setup?
Was she walking into a trap?
And what exactly did Noah have up his sleeve?

###Chapter 304:
The air inside the villa felt thick and heavy, the faint scent of alcohol mixing with a stifling stillness that made it hard to breathe. The silence pressed down on Sadie’s chest like an unseen force.
Noah lounged on the leather sofa, his posture deceptively relaxed yet exuding undeniable authority. He swirled the amber liquid in his glass, the ice clinking softly against the crystal.noveldrama
The chandelier’s warm glow cast sharp shadows across his figure, accentuating the slight part of his unbuttoned collar and the sharp lines of his collarbones.
The moment Sadie laid eyes on Noah, something inside her snapped. Her nails dug into her palms, her teeth sinking into her lower lip as she fought to steady herself. But the storm inside her refused to be silenced.
“Noah Wall!” Sadie burst out, her voice unsteady with fury. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?”
Noah’s gaze lifted slowly, his dark eyes locking onto Sadie with an intensity that made her breath hitch. He didn’t respond immediately, his silence only fueling Sadie’s anger.
Sadie’s heart pounded, her words spilling out in a rush. “Why are you going after the Howe Group? You know Alex has helped me before; why are you doing this?” Her eyes reddened, unshed tears shimmering, but she refused to let them fall, clinging desperately to her composure.
Noah swirled the glass in his hand again, the amber liquid catching the light and casting a cold, almost predatory gleam.
“It’s just business,” he said, his tone indifferent. “In the world of commerce, there’s only room for one winner. Surely you understand that.”
Noah’s words struck Sadie like a dagger, sharp and unrelenting, piercing straight through her.

“Just business?” Sadie echoed, her voice fracturing under the weight of disbelief. “Noah, why do you keep coming after me? We settled everything between us; there’s nothing left. So why can’t you just let me go?”
Sadie couldn’t understand why Noah kept pulling her back when she had already walked away.
Noah stood, his movements steady, each step punctuating the thick silence between them. Stopping just inches away, he locked eyes with her, a quiet menace lacing his voice as he murmured, “Sadie, are you asking me to spare the Howe Group and alter my the company’s entire strategy?”
He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. “You’ll need more than words to make that happen.”
Sadie’s breath caught in her throat as her mind flashed back to the night when Noah had been drugged.
Her hands shook, and her nails dug into her palms as she fought to hold herself together. The bag she had been holding slipped from her fingers, landing with a dull thud on the floor, its sound echoing in the silence.
Sadie raised her head slowly, her eyes meeting Noah’s with a quiet but firm defiance. A single tear fell, but she refused to let it break her composure.
For a moment, the world seemed to stand still, and Sadie knew the decision she had to make. She couldn’t let the Howe family crumble under Noah’s pressure, nor could she allow her studio to be dismantled. Sadie’s hands trembled, but an unshakable resolve anchored her. She began unfastening each button of her blouse. The room seemed to shrink around her, the air thick with an unspoken weight.

###Chapter 306:
A chilling frost settled in Noah’s eyes, his expression turning unreadable. The lengths Sadie had gone to for another man ignited something cold within him that he hadn’t expected.
Noah’s glass slipped through his fingers, crashing onto the floor in a violent shatter. The sharp sound sent a ripple through the tense air.
“I have no interest in someone like you,” Noah said, his voice low and controlled.
Sadie froze, her body going rigid as the full weight of his words crashed over her like a tidal wave, swallowing her whole in a suffocating tide of shame.
Noah took a step closer, his presence looming over her like a shadow. “I’m not finished yet,” he murmured, his tone edged with finality. “There’s been no hostess at this house for too long. And the position, well, it’s yours, whether you like it or not.”
Without waiting for a response, Noah bent down, picked up Sadie’s fallen bag, and threw it at her. His next words left no room for argument. “You’ll stay here at Myrtlewood Estate.”
Turning away, Noah walked upstairs but paused midway. Glancing back at Sadie, who had collapsed onto the floor, he spoke with chilling calm. “If you try to run again, I’ll make sure Howe Group ceases to exist.”
With that, Noah turned and continued his ascent, vanishing from Sadie’s sight without a second glance.
Sadie stayed where she was, tears slipping down her cheeks in a steady stream. Her chest felt hollow, as though her very soul was being chipped away, piece by piece. She had returned to this gilded cage, this suffocating prison, the one place she had sworn never to enter again. Time seemed to stretch into eternity as she sat there, her mind numb, lost in the oppressive silence of her surroundings. She had no sense of how long had passed. Eventually, the sound of footsteps broke through her trance.
The butler stepped into the room, his presence both gentle and uncertain. “Mrs. Wall, are you alright?” he asked, his voice careful, his gaze flickering over her with quiet concern.
Sadie nodded faintly, her eyes distant and unfocused as they traced the intricate patterns of the crystal chandelier above. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper, rough and unsteady. “Averi. Can you bring him here? Please.”

Sadie’s heart ached at the thought of her little boy. He was still so young, so fragile, especially after his recent surgery. The idea of being separated from him now was unbearable.
The butler shifted uncomfortably, his face clouded with unease. “Mrs. Wall,” he began carefully, “I’m afraid I don’t have the authority to make that decision. For now, please try to rest. We can address this matter later.”
The butler helped Sadie up the stairs, a mix of persuasion and firm insistence guiding her toward the master bedroom. As soon as the door swung open, she went rigid.
The layout, the furnishings, even the shade of the drapes—everything was precisely as it had been three years prior, as if this space had remained untouched by time.
Not a speck of dust marred the surfaces. It was clear that someone had been meticulously tending to the room all along.
But why?
She had left. Wouldn’t Noah have welcomed her absence?
How was this possible? noveldrama

###Chapter 307:
When she first got married, she had entered this very room brimming with optimism. Now, all that remained was emptiness and shattered hope. After mechanically completing her shower, she settled onto the bed, but rest evaded her.
Noah’s detached, emotionless stare lingered in her mind, refusing to fade. She had no sense of how long she had lain there before the mattress shifted beside her.
A familiar presence enveloped her.
Noah had returned.
Without a word, he drew her into his embrace, his warm breath skimming her neck, sending an involuntary tremor through her body.
Sadie tensed instinctively, hands clenched so tightly that her nails bit into her palms.
Yet she neither resisted nor pulled away. She lay still, as if stripped of her will, allowing him to hold her.
“Averi is still little. He needs me.” At some point, her voice, barely more than a breath, broke the silence.
Noah’s eyes flickered open, his expression unreadable. A hint of something unspoken ghosted across his face.
“Tomorrow, I’ll have someone bring that bastard here.”
Sadie’s head snapped up, fury igniting in her pale features. “My child is not a bastard.”
Each word was slow, deliberate, brimming with defiance.noveldrama
“Oh? Not a bastard?” Noah’s lips curled into a smirk, cold and taunting, as if he had just heard the punchline of a cruel joke. “He’s the child you had with Alex. What else should I call him?” His voice sharpened, barely concealing his rage.

In an instant, he moved on top of Sadie, pinning her in place. “You care that much about the son you had with him?” His gaze burned into her, sharp and unrelenting. “If it’s a child you want, I can give you one myself.”
How ridiculous.
A chill seeped into Sadie’s bones, numbing her from the inside out.
Three years ago, he had said that if she ever conceived, he would make her abort the child.
Now, after all this time, he claimed he’d give her one.
The bitter irony of it stole her breath.
She shut her eyes, refusing to acknowledge him.
No fight. No tears. Just an overwhelming void.
Noah studied the woman beneath him, her lack of reaction stirring an inexplicable frustration in his chest.
Without another word, he pushed himself away and stormed out.
“Bang!” The door slammed behind him, the sharp sound echoing through the silent room.
Sadie pulled the blanket tighter around herself, curling into a ball.
She didn’t sleep at all.
By dawn, golden light streamed through the sheer curtains.
Sadie lay motionless, her face pale, her vacant eyes unblinking.
Memories of the night before replayed in an endless loop, constricting her chest.

###Chapter 308:
“Tap. Tap. Tap…” Soft, hurried footsteps approached, followed by an eager, naive voice. “Mommy!”
Averi barreled into Sadie’s arms, a burst of warmth in the cold, heavy air.
Sadie clung to him, as if holding on for dear life.
At that moment, exhaustion and despair melted away.
“Mommy, I missed you so much.” Averi buried his face in her neck, his voice a sweet melody easing her pain.
A faint smile touched her lips. “I missed you too, my love.” A maid quietly placed Averi’s luggage aside before slipping out.
Sadie stroked Averi’s soft hair, her emotions a tangled mess.
How could she explain this chaos to him? How could she shield him from what was to come?
A sudden knock pulled her from her thoughts.
The door creaked open, revealing Kyla holding a thermal food jar.
She wore a delicate yellow dress, the soft color complementing her charming appearance.
But the moment her gaze landed on Sadie and Averi, her smile stiffened.
“What are you doing here?” Her voice held an edge of disbelief and accusation.
Sadie remained silent, tightening her grip on her son, her eyes cold as they met Kyla’s.
She had no interest in engaging with that woman.
Kyla’s frustration flared at Sadie’s unbothered stance.
How could this woman, discarded by Noah, still have the audacity to appear in his villa?
“Sadie, you…”
“Kyla, what brings you here?” Noah’s voice rang from the doorway, cutting her off.
Dressed in a sleek charcoal-gray suit, he exuded an imposing presence.
At the sight of him, the anger in Kyla’s eyes vanished, replaced by softness.
“Noah, I made soup for you. You must be tired from work, so I brought it over.” Her voice was sweet, her smile gentle as she held out the jar.
Noah didn’t say anything, his gaze briefly flicking to Sadie and Averi, his expression unreadable.
The air grew heavy with unspoken tension.
“Noah,” Kyla bit her lip, hesitation creeping into her voice. The food jar in her hands felt heavier, as if suddenly burdensome.
The soup she had so carefully prepared now seemed worthless.
Noah’s brow furrowed slightly. “Just leave it there,” he said, tone indifferent.
Those words struck Kyla like ice water, dousing the flicker of hope in her chest. Her grip on the food jar tightened, frustration simmering beneath the surface.
“But, Noah…” Kyla paused, her words teetering on the brink of her lips.
Noah cut her off with a calm yet decisive tone. “Kyla, there are other matters I need to handle.”
A chill raced through Kyla’s heart, her unspoken words retreating back into silence.
It was clear; Noah was pushing her away.

###Chapter 309:
Her eyes flicked to Sadie, then back to Noah, her heart burning with envy. Why? Why was it that Sadie and her child could remain while she was sent away?
Though Kyla resisted the idea, she felt powerless to change her situation.
Finally, she clenched her jaw and said, “Fine. I’ll leave now.”
With these words, she left, her departure marked by a rigid posture that masked her raging emotions.
Throughout this, Sadie said nothing, clutching her son closely.
The way Noah had just treated Kyla was unexpected, sparking a hint of astonishment within her.
Noah had always shown a soft, yielding side to Kyla in her recollections, never dismissing her so outright.
Yet today, his attitude had completely changed. It was now cold and steady.
Half an hour later, in the living room, Noah moved towards the door, seemingly ready to leave.
Observing his firm, poised stance, Sadie felt a spontaneous urge to keep him there a little longer.
Rising to her feet, she suggested, “It’s still quite early. Maybe you could have some breakfast before leaving?”
Halting abruptly, Noah turned around.noveldrama
His gaze met Sadie’s, a brief look of confusion crossing his face as he processed her earlier words.
“Alright,” he said with a lightness that masked his feelings.
A soft sigh escaped Sadie in response.

She approached the dining table.
Aromatic steam from the oatmeal and fresh pastries wafted through the air, filling the room with inviting scents.
Noah took a seat, his eyes appreciating the breakfast before him, and a subtle smile touched his lips.
The table was set with a heartier fare than usual. This breakfast bore a comforting, homemade quality unlike the standard offerings she had prepared before.
He picked up a spoon, scooped up some oatmeal, and tasted it.
“Not bad,” he said, his voice infused with an unexpected warmth.
With a cheerful tone, a maid said, “Indeed. Mrs. Wall prepared this herself.”
Watching Noah relish the meal, Sadie felt a sense of ease wash over her.
Though she had prepared the breakfast mainly for Averi’s sake, worried that the usual fare in the villa wouldn’t suit the child, she hadn’t anticipated this misunderstanding with Noah.
Nevertheless, it was of little consequence. She had more pressing matters to address with him.
Pausing briefly, Sadie gathered her thoughts. “Um, I was thinking about going back to the studio to work. And about Averi’s kindergarten…”
Noah placed his spoon down and gave her his full attention. “You should talk to the butler for such matters.”
“Alright,” Sadie responded with a nod, feeling a sense of relief.

###Chapter 310:
Noah didn’t reject the proposals. His direction to consult the butler effectively meant his consent was given.
Rising to his feet, Noah straightened his suit jacket.
“I must attend to some matters. Enjoy your day.”
With those words, he exited the estate, never once looking back.
As Sadie watched his silhouette vanish through the doorway, her feelings were a complex whirl of emotions.
She didn’t know what Noah was thinking, nor could she predict what the future held for them.
Her immediate priority, however, was to look after Averi.
Meanwhile, Kyla made her way furiously to the branch office and violently shut her office door, the sound echoing loudly.
Her chest heaved with anger.
“Why? Why does Sadie get to live at Myrtlewood Estate?” She seethed in silence, her voice dripping with fury. “I am the rightful lady of Myrtlewood Estate.”
As she paced her office, Kyla’s hands were clenched so tightly that her nails threatened to pierce her skin.
At that moment, there was a hesitant knock on the door from the design department manager.
“Come in.” Kyla forced herself to suppress her fury, trying to make her voice sound calm.
The manager walked in cautiously, holding a pile of documents, and moved toward her hesitantly.
gα?ησν?s?com offers tales worth telling
“Miss Wade, we have Ms. Shaw’s jewelry design drafts ready. Additionally, the invitation for the Starlight Gala has arrived.”noveldrama
Receiving the documents, Kyla skimmed them quickly, her expression changing as an idea began to form.
“The Starlight Gala…” she muttered to herself as a plan started taking shape in her mind.
“Send out the order. Accelerate the production of Ms. Shaw’s jewelry. Ensure it’s ready before the Starlight Gala,” Kyla instructed unequivocally, leaving no space for debate.
The manager’s face tensed, revealing his uncertainty. “Miss Wade, achieving that might be impossible. We initially planned for delivery a month from now, and the gala is just three days away…”
“I don’t care!” Kyla’s hand slammed down on her desk, producing a resounding snap that silenced him instantly. “I expect results, not excuses. Fail to meet the deadline, and you’re all fired, starting with you!”
The design department manager shuddered, beads of sweat forming on his brow.
Fully aware of Kyla’s fierce disposition, he dared not contest her demands. With a hesitant nod, he said, “Y-Yes, Miss Wade. I’ll organize it immediately.” He exited the office, each step laden with the weight of impending consequences.
Kyla watched him go, a chilling smirk tugging at the corners of her lips.
“Now, Sadie, let’s see how you manage against me.”
Despite Sadie working with the Shaw Group through Eva’s secret assignment on another project involving the Starlight Gala, Kyla was intolerant of any competition. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 311:
She just couldn’t tolerate it.
Should Wall Group manage to deliver the jewelry to Eva ahead of the Starlight Gala, their strong connection would undoubtedly ensure Eva wore it. Kyla eagerly anticipated witnessing Sadie’s response when the limelight inevitably remained on her.
In her studio, Sadie put down the draft she had been reviewing and rubbed her tired eyes.
She had planned on stepping out for a quick break, but when she saw Nanette and Mindy Gordon still working, she paused in confusion.
She thought everyone had already left.
“Why are you two still here?” Sadie asked.
Nanette finally looked up from her desk, adjusted her glasses, and smiled. “Of course, we’re staying, Miss Hudson! We built this studio from the ground up together. How can we just leave you alone?”
Mindy nodded and echoed her sentiment. “Exactly! And honestly, where else can we find a boss as amazing as you?”
Their words made Sadie feel all warm and fuzzy. She smiled at them, her eyes misting slightly. “Thank you. We will definitely succeed with this project.”
Unexpectedly, Nanette leaned closer, her eyes twinkling with curiosity. “Miss Hudson… The car that dropped you off this morning was a top-of-the-line Maybach. Very impressive!”
Sadie froze for a second as the memory of the butler arranging her ride that morning flashed in her mind.
She shrugged off Nanette’s comment, saying, “Oh, it’s my friend’s car.” But Nanette gave her a knowing look, her lips curling into a mischievous smile.
Thankfully, Nanette didn’t press the issue any further.noveldrama
Sadie sighed to herself. She had wanted to drive herself that morning, in her own car, but the butler insisted it was safer to have a driver give her a ride. He had arranged for one of Noah’s cars to take Averi to the kindergarten before dropping Sadie off at the studio.
Sadie knew the real deal, though—the butler, and likely the entire staff at the villa, was simply taking precautions to keep her from running off.
“All right, then. Let’s get back to work.”
Sadie gathered her bearings and went back to her office. The studio was silent apart from the sound of clacking keys as her employees typed nonstop on their keyboards.
Sadie picked up the draft she had set aside. The Starlight Gala was just around the corner.
As the night deepened, Myrtlewood Estate was brightly lit.
Sadie entered Averi’s room and found him sound asleep under the covers.
“Mommy…” the boy mumbled, his tiny hand reaching out and clutching hers. Sadie smiled and leaned in to press a kiss on his forehead. “Sweetheart, it’s time for dinner. You need to wake up and come downstairs.”
She waited until Averi got out of bed before padding out of the room.
Averi could already dress himself and come downstairs on his own.
As Sadie reached the staircase, she heard a group of servants whispering amongst themselves below.

###Chapter 312:
“The boy’s parentage is highly questionable. Who’s to say whose child he really is?”noveldrama
“Shh! Keep your voice down! If anyone hears us, we’d be in big trouble!”
“Please, what’s there to be afraid of? That boy is a bastard. Did they really expect us to treat him like the young master of this estate?”
“She’s right. And who’s to say that woman didn’t use some ploy to trick Mr. Wall into her clutches? Why else would he be so obsessed with her?”
Sadie stopped in her tracks, her brows furrowing tightly.
It seemed that the new servants knew nothing about her relationship with Noah. She continued down the stairs and called out, “What are you guys talking about?”
Although her voice was calm, it carried an unmistakable hint of authority. The maids immediately shut their mouths and turned in her direction. When they saw that it was Sadie, they didn’t seem all too worried.
“Miss Hudson, we—” one started to say, only to be interrupted by another servant.
“What business is it of yours? You’re nothing but a fraud, anyway. Did you actually think you’re the mistress of this house?”
Sadie’s face turned grim. She was just about to give the impertinent maid a piece of her mind when a male voice boomed from behind her.
“What’s going on here?”
Noah appeared at the doorway, with the butler closely trailing behind him, his expression anxious.
The maids fell silent, and this time, they looked genuinely nervous.
The butler quickly stepped forward. “I will handle this right away, Mr. Wall.”
Noah swept a cold glance over the maids. “I don’t like gossipers in my house. Fire every single one of them.”
Then he turned to Sadie, his eyes deep and unreadable.
Sadie didn’t know what to make of it. She could barely process what had just happened.
Was Noah actually defending her?
Dinner was soon served. The table was laden with a variety of dishes in exquisite porcelain plates, their mouthwatering aroma filling the dining hall.
Averi sat in his high chair with a small bowl of mashed potatoes and a plate of diced chicken in front of him. He poked at the food with his spoon, his chubby little face tight with displeasure.
“Mom, this doesn’t taste good,” he complained, pouting as he set his spoon down.
Averi wrinkled his nose.
Sadie reached out and stroked his hair. “Sweetheart, try to eat a little, okay? The cook made this just for you.”
“I don’t want it…” Averi pouted. “I want fried chicken and fries.”
Sitting at the center of the table, Noah watched the interaction between mother and son in silence.
Averi’s words made his brows furrow. “The kitchen here at Myrtlewood doesn’t serve unhealthy snacks.”
Averi’s small body shuddered. He looked down at his fingers, his expression pitiful, and didn’t dare to make another sound. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 313:
Sadie didn’t like that at all. She knew Noah meant well, but it was only natural for a child to crave snacks and junk food every once in a while. “He’s still young. It’s fine to indulge him occasionally.”
Noah directed his narrowed gaze at her. “Indulging a child isn’t in their best interests. You’ll be spoiling him before you know it.”
Sadie pressed her lips into a tight line and bit back her words. There was no point in arguing with Noah about this.
Needless to say, the atmosphere in the dining hall grew tense.
“There will be a party in three days,” Noah finally said. “Go with me as my date.”
Sadie was visibly taken aback, but she still nodded and said, “Okay.” As the night grew late, peace eventually fell over Myrtlewood Estate.
Noah was in his study, buried in a pile of documents.
“Mr. Wall…” A soft, childish voice suddenly broke the silence in the room.
Noah turned toward the door with a frown.
Averi was rubbing his drooping eyes, his feet bare, his gait a little wobbly as he entered the study.
“Mr. Wall…” the little boy called out again, his other hand clutching a fistful of his bear-patterned pajamas.
Noah set aside the papers he had been reading and took a good look at the little figure approaching him. He couldn’t help the wave of tenderness that swelled inside his chest.
Before he knew it, he had stood up and walked around his desk. “Why are you awake?” he asked, barely noticing that his voice had instinctively softened.
Averi was obviously still a little groggy, as he all but pounced on Noah’s leg, hugging it before rubbing his tiny face against the fabric of Noah’s trousers. “I want Mommy…”

Noah looked down at the little guy and relaxed.
He bent and picked Averi up with ease. The boy’s small, chubby body was soft and carried a faint scent of milk.
An emotion surged in Noah’s heart, something he was unfamiliar with and could therefore not name.
He carried Averi out of the study and into the master bedroom.
Inside, Sadie was fast asleep, completely oblivious to her son’s nighttime escapade.
Noah carefully tucked the boy beside her.
Averi immediately turned over and snuggled into Sadie’s arms, his little fist now clutching at her pajama shirt.
Noah lingered for a while, just watching the scene before him with a gentle smile on his face.
Then he turned the bedside lamp off and lay down on the other side of the bed. He laid his arm over Sadie so that he was cupping Averi’s side, gathering them into a huge embrace.
It was quiet in the room, apart from the soft, steady sounds of their breathing.
Noah craned his neck and glanced at the sleeping mother and son. He could feel something else blossoming inside his chest, and this one he could name — peace.
Morning came, and sunlight filtered through the curtains and fell into the room in bright, narrow beams. noveldrama

###Chapter 314:
Sadie opened her eyes to the sight of a cute face just inches away from hers. Averi’s cheek was pressed against her arm, his mouth hanging open slightly as he slept.
Sadie shifted, only to realize that someone else was sleeping behind her. Noah. She found the situation quite surreal, and if she hadn’t felt the warmth of both their bodies, she might have thought she was only dreaming.
Sadie’s chest welled with emotion.
There was a time when all she had wanted was to live an ordinary life with Noah and their child, just like any other couple. But then, everything changed.
She would still feel her heart soften at such poignant moments, but she no longer yearned for them to last.
She gently extracted Averi from her arms and got out of bed as quietly as she could.
“Good morning, Mrs. Wall. Have you seen Averi?”
Sadie had just gone out the door when the butler hurried over with a worried expression, his forehead dotted with sweat.
“Slow down. What’s wrong?”
“Averi is missing! We’ve searched the entire estate, but we couldn’t find him.” The butler’s voice was trembling, and he looked like he was on the verge of tears.
“Oh, it’s all right,” Sadie quickly reassured him. “He’s in the master bedroom.” Noah had probably brought the boy over last night. How else would Averi end up there when he had his own room?
The butler paused, staring at her for a couple of seconds, then let out a long sigh of relief.
“Goodness, I was so scared! I thought he’d been taken or something.” The poor man patted his chest and took several deep breaths.

Sadie couldn’t help but feel guilty. “I apologize for worrying you.”
But the butler waved it off. “Nothing to apologize for, Mrs. Wall. The important thing is that Averi is safe. Anyway, breakfast is ready.”
Watching the butler’s retreating figure, Sadie let out a soft sigh of relief. Swiveling around to head back to the master bedroom and check on Averi, she felt her phone buzz in her pocket.
Pulling it out, she saw Alex’s name flash across the screen, causing her to pause.
“Hello?” Sadie answered tentatively, uncertainty threading her voice.
“Are you all right, Sadie? I heard…” Alex’s voice, thick with concern, trailed off as he waited for her reply.
“I’m fine,” Sadie cut in, her tone a delicate balance of reassurance and tension. “What about the Howe Group? Everything okay there?”
A sigh of relief echoed from the other end. “Don’t worry. Everything’s under control. The company’s stable now. No need for you to stress.”
After a slight pause, Alex’s voice softened. “Where are you now? Are you safe?”
Just as Sadie opened her mouth to reply, a deep, unexpected voice chilled the air behind her.
“She’s right here in Myrtlewood Estate—what danger could possibly exist here?”
Startled, Sadie turned to find Noah looming close behind her, his expression unreadable and his presence almost suffocating. noveldrama

###Chapter 315:
A shiver raced down her spine, her grip tightening on the phone. She glanced at Noah in panic, her eyes flashing with fear.
“I have something urgent to handle. I need to go,” she stammered hurriedly, her voice faltering as she dared not meet Noah’s intense gaze.
With a quick tap, the phone call ended, leaving Sadie staring at her own pale reflection on the darkened screen.
Noah took a deliberate step forward, his shadow encroaching as Sadie instinctively backed away, until the chill of the wall seeped through her clothes, trapping her.
His towering figure loomed oppressively close, overwhelming her with its sheer bulk.
“You…” Sadie’s voice faltered, her lips quivering as she mustered the courage to speak.
However, before she could form the words, Noah interrupted with a swift motion, snatching the phone right out of her trembling hand.
He cast a cursory glance at the screen, his eyes narrowing when he saw Alex’s name. In that instant, his expression turned cold, his piercing gaze seemingly cutting straight through Sadie.
With a flick of his wrist, he threw the phone over the railing of the second floor. It plummeted, crashing onto the marble floor with a resounding “Pak!” The device shattered, its pieces scattering like shards of ice.
Stunned by the sheer suddenness of his action, Sadie could only stare in horror at the remains of her phone, her mind reeling from the shock.
As the initial disbelief faded, a fierce wave of anger surged within her, igniting a fiery protest.
“What in the world did you just do? Have you gone completely insane, Noah Wall?” Sadie’s gaze shot up, her voice unsteady but laced with fury.

Noah looked down at her, his expression unwavering.
“It’s mine. I can do as I please with it.”
“You’ve got to be kidding me! That is my phone!” Sadie snapped, her voice rising with frustration. She couldn’t believe how overbearing he was.
“It’s not yours anymore. It’s mine,” Noah stated firmly, his tone leaving no room for argument. “Just like you, Sadie. You belong to me now.”
He reached out, his fingers tightening around her chin, forcing her eyes to meet his.
“Don’t forget who you are, Mrs. Wall.”
Despite the sharp pain from his grip, Sadie’s resolve didn’t waver, her eyes fierce with defiance.
“Mrs. Wall? Is that what being your wife means? To be trampled and humiliated at your whim?” she retorted, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and anger.
Noah’s response was a low, rough whisper. “Don’t test my patience, Sadie.” His words carried an unmistakable warning, though beneath the surface, a storm of emotions threatened to break free.
With one final, piercing look, he turned and strode away, leaving Sadie in the echoing silence of the aftermath.
Leaning against the cold, unyielding wall, Sadie felt the last of her strength ebb away. She slid down to the floor, her body folding into itself as she hugged her knees tightly to her chest.noveldrama
Sadie rested her chin on her knees, staring vacantly at the broken pieces of her phone scattered across the floor, like fragments of her shattered resolve.

The butler stepped forward, holding a brand-new phone box. “Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall asked me to deliver this to you.” He extended the box toward her with both hands, his posture respectful.
Sadie paused, her expression unreadable for a moment before she met his gaze. She took the box with a slight tremble in her hands, her eyes flicking over the butler as he continued softly, “Mr. Wall mentioned your previous phone was broken. This is its replacement.”
With mechanical movements, Sadie peeled open the box. Inside lay the latest model, identical to her previous device. She switched it on, her heart sinking as the screen lit up to reveal a single contact—Noah.
A suffocating weight of despair settled over her, making it difficult to breathe.
Elsewhere, the mood was starkly different.
“I finally found something!” Claud exclaimed, his voice crackling with a mix of triumph and a craving for approval.
Impatient, Susannah tapped her nails against the table, each click echoing sharply in the room. “What is it, Claud? Just say it already!”
Claud thrust a stack of glossy photos toward her. They depicted Sadie’s comings and goings at the Myrtlewood Estate with undeniable clarity.
“Mrs. Howe, Sadie has been staying at Myrtlewood Estate these last few days,” he stated.
One by one, Susannah flipped through the images, her expression contorting into a scowl that deepened with every photo.

Abruptly, she slammed the stack down, the impact resonating like a gunshot.
“Myrtlewood Estate! That’s Noah’s private residence.”
“Yes, Mrs. Howe,” Claud responded, his tone cautious as he gauged her stormy demeanor, bracing for the tempest that might follow. “Well…”
Susannah’s hand crashed down on the table, a thunderous clap in the tense silence of the room. Her cheeks burned red with fury as she spat out her suspicion. “Noah is targeting the Howe family. Could it be because of that woman?”
Without waiting for an answer, she shot up from her chair, her movements erratic as she paced the room like a caged lion.
“But… isn’t Kyla Noah’s true love?” Claud ventured, his voice laced with hesitation, breaking the charged atmosphere.
At his words, Susannah halted mid-stride, her expression morphing into sheer contempt. “Kyla… Is it possible Sadie is toying with both Noah’s and Alex’s feelings? Who is this woman, really?”
She whirled around, her gaze sharp and accusing as she locked eyes with Claud. “Don’t stop until you’ve uncovered everything about Sadie,” she demanded, her voice sharp and unwavering.
“Understood,” Claud replied, his voice barely above a whisper as he exited swiftly.
Moments after Claud’s departure, Alex made a hurried descent down the stairs. Susannah, now seated and sipping her coffee, watched him intently. Her voice was deceptively calm as she called out, “Heading out, Alex?” She had just learned Sadie was staying at Myrtlewood Estate.

###Chapter 317:
As she watched Alex get ready to leave, a nagging suspicion crept into her mind.
Alex paused, not turning around. “I’m heading out for a bit,” he replied, his tone detached.
“At this hour? You’re not headed to the office, so where might you be off to? And without even a word to your mother?” Susannah’s voice carried a gentle reproach as she tried to weave in a maternal concern, her words soft yet deliberate, aiming to dissuade him from his plans to leave.
Rising from her chair, she leaned heavily on the table, her stance faltering slightly, feigning unsteadiness. “Oh, my head is spinning…” she murmured, her tone laced with discomfort.
At the sound of her strained voice, Alex instinctively pivoted back to face her. The sight of Susannah’s ashen face and deeply furrowed brows painted a clear picture of her distress.
A pang of worry tightened his heart, propelling him to her side in swift strides. “What’s wrong, Mom? You don’t look well,” he asked, his voice thick with concern.
With a trembling hand pressed to her forehead, Susannah gripped his arm with her other hand, leaning on him as if he were her lifeline.
“I’m just a bit dizzy… It might be my blood pressure spiking again,” she said, her voice quivering, hinting at the severity of her discomfort.
Alex’s resolve to leave crumbled as he witnessed her weakened state. He gently helped her sit on the sofa, his tone imbued with urgent worry. “I’m calling the doctor right away,” he declared, reaching for his phone.
But Susannah, with a weak but firm grasp, caught his hand and slowly shook her head. “No need for that. It’s an old problem. I just need to rest a while. Stay with me, just for a bit?” Her eyes pleaded more earnestly than her words.
Torn, Alex paused, the weight of his mother’s plea anchoring him firmly at her side. Softly patting her hand, he relented with a tender smile. “Alright, I’ll stay. Just rest.”

The tension in the room thickened to an almost palpable fog, punctuated only by Susannah’s breathing, which was uneven and a bit strained. The air hung heavy, pressing down like an unseen weight.
As the clock struck noon, Kyla made her entrance into Noah’s office, clad in a sharply tailored business suit that hugged her graceful curves perfectly. She settled onto the plush leather sofa, crossing her legs with deliberate elegance, her lips curled into a poised, self-assured smile.
“Noah, what do you say we have dinner together tonight? There’s a new spot that just opened up—I hear the cuisine is out of this world.”
Noah remained anchored behind his desk, his long fingers absentmindedly drumming on the desk.
He seemed engrossed in the documents sprawled before him, seemingly oblivious to her invitation.
The office was eerily quiet, the relentless ticking of the wall clock slicing through the silence like a knife.
Kyla’s smile briefly wavered, a shadow of disappointment flickering across her face. She composed herself swiftly, clearing her throat gently. “Noah?” This time, Noah lifted his gaze, his deep-set eyes locking onto hers.
His voice was flat, almost dismissive. “I have plans tonight.”
Kyla’s heart dropped, but her resolve didn’t waver.

###Chapter 318:
“What plans? Anything you can’t possibly reschedule?”
At that moment, Noah’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the caller ID—”Sadie”—and read the incoming text.
“I’m cooking tonight. Will you be home for dinner?”
The corners of his mouth betrayed him, curving into a subtle smile as he quickly typed back, “Yes.”
Placing the phone down, Noah met Kyla’s gaze again, his expression unchanged.
“Sorry, Kyla, but tonight’s really not a good time.”noveldrama
Kyla’s complexion turned pale as she gripped her handbag, her nails digging painfully into her palm.
Her effort to appear calm was in vain, her shaky voice betraying her. “Could it be… Sadie?”
Noah simply gave a faint nod, confirming her suspicion without a word.
Kyla tried to stifle the overwhelming surge of emotions, rising to her feet with a forced smile. “I see.”
As she turned around, her smile faded, replaced by deep resentment. The sound of the office door slamming echoed through the room with a sharp clang.
Noah’s face remained stoic, his deep eyes reflecting an array of unspoken thoughts.
The soft light from the phone screen cast a glow on Sadie’s face, revealing the turmoil within her.
“Yes.”

That single word on the screen felt unexpectedly sharp. She kept staring at it, her emotions swirling inside her. Words failed to capture her feelings.
Such a response from Noah was unexpected. After their harsh exchange in the morning, she had anticipated that he would ignore her for days, maybe even weeks.
Considering the confrontation and wishing to avoid further confinement, Sadie had deliberated all day before deciding to diffuse the situation and sending that message.
She tucked her phone into her bag and reached for her coat.
“Nanette, I need to handle something. I’ll leave the remaining tasks to you,” she said to Nanette.
Nanette looked up, taken aback. “Oh? Sadie, it’s still early. Is there an emergency?”
A fragile smile crossed Sadie’s lips. “Yes, it’s just something personal. Also, please monitor the progress on the Starlight Gala project.”
“Understood, Sadie.” Nanette, still somewhat confused, gave a compliant nod.
With that, Sadie exited the studio in a hurry.
Throughout her journey home, she pondered the best way to approach Noah. Upon arriving at Myrtlewood Estate, Sadie paused to collect her thoughts before stepping inside.
The living room was eerily silent. A maid bowed respectfully and said, “Welcome home, Mrs. Wall.”
Acknowledging her with a nod, Sadie proceeded to the kitchen to inspect it.
Everything was in perfect order.

###Chapter 319:
Opening the refrigerator, she checked the stock of ingredients.
“Tap, tap, tap…” From a distance, the sound of quick, light footsteps echoed. Turning, Sadie saw Averi joyfully running towards her, his backpack bouncing with each hop, closely followed by the butler.
“Mommy!” Averi exclaimed, jumping into Sadie’s arms and planting a loud kiss on her cheek.
“Sweetheart, did you have a good day at kindergarten?” Sadie asked, her voice soft as she embraced her son.
“Yes!” Averi said eagerly.
Laughing, the butler said, “Today, Averi was praised by his teacher at school.” Sadie gently ruffled her son’s hair, her eyes shining with pride and affection.
Suddenly, a disturbance at the front door signaled Noah’s return.
He passed his coat to a servant and made his way directly to the dining room. “Mr. Wall!” As soon as Averi spotted Noah, he slipped from Sadie’s embrace and dashed towards him.
Noah’s heart softened immediately. He knelt to lift Averi into his arms. “Have you been a good boy for Mommy today?”
“Yes,” Averi replied clearly.
They gathered at the dining table when dinner was ready. The servants brought out dish after dish, each more inviting and beautifully arranged than the last.
In silence, Sadie piled food onto Averi’s plate, while Noah ate quietly. A subtle, almost unnoticeable tension filled the air around them.
Suddenly, Noah’s phone broke the silence with its ring.
He checked the caller ID to see Kyla’s name.
For updates, visit ?αl?ovs.co?
After picking up, he heard Kyla’s frail voice. “Noah, I feel terrible…”
Sadie’s grip on her utensils tightened, her eyes drifting towards Noah, despite herself.
Maintaining his composure, Noah responded, “What seems to be the problem? You should consult a doctor.” Sadie was stunned.
In the past, whenever Kyla reached out, Noah would immediately drop everything to be by her side, regardless of the hour or his current activities. This time, however, he made no move to leave.
Kyla’s voice carried a note of distress over the phone. “But… I want to see you…”
Noah responded with detached coolness, “If you’re unwell, it’s best to rest. I’m occupied right now.”
After ending the call, he returned his phone to his pocket.
A pang of curiosity hit Sadie, and she secretly observed Noah, searching for any sign of change in his demeanor.
His expression remained unreadable, betraying no sign of the conversation that had just occurred.
Tension at the table thickened evidently.
Even Averi picked up on the mood, eating his meal in silence.
After a while, Sadie found the nerve to address the issue, her tone tentative. “If Miss Wade is truly sick, perhaps you should visit her. What if…”
She paused, her voice quivering a bit. “What if something serious is wrong? That would be awful.”

###Chapter 320:
Sadie realized the bravery it took to voice those concerns. She knew well how much Noah cared about Kyla. Should anything befall Kyla, Sadie feared she might be the one being blamed.
As she finished speaking, her heart raced.
She glanced once more at Noah, searching his face for any sign of a reaction. Noah’s face, which had been calm, suddenly turned grim, his expression cold. He placed his utensils down forcefully, the noise resounding sharply in the silent dining room. His eyes, intense and cold, were fixed on Sadie.
“Sadie, are you trying to push me away?”
Stunned by his response, Sadie was left speechless, unsure of how to reply.
At that moment, the sharp ringing of a phone shattered the quiet tension in the dining room. Pulling her phone from her pocket in a swift motion, Sadie glanced at the screen and saw it was from Laura’s caregiver, Lexi Chavez. A knot formed in her stomach.
“Hello? Lexi, what’s wrong?” Sadie’s voice shook as she spoke.
From the other end of the line, Lexi’s voice, laced with anxiety, replied, “Mrs. Stewart has collapsed in the bedroom. I—I’m at a loss!”
“What?!” Sadie’s complexion drained of color, her hand clutching the phone so tightly her knuckles turned white. “Don’t lose your head. Check if my grandma is breathing and make sure the room is aired out. I’ll be there as soon as I can!” With a sudden surge, she rose, knocking her chair to the floor with a muffled crash.
As Noah observed her agitated movements, his brow creased. “What’s going on?” he inquired.
“My… my grandma has fainted!” Sadie stammered, her eyes brimming with tears.

Clutching her handbag, she turned swiftly to leave.
“I’ll drive you,” Noah said, standing decisively.
Without a word, Sadie accepted; time was of the essence.
Approaching Averi, she knelt before him, her voice trembling yet calm. “Sweetheart, I need to see Great-grandma because she’s unwell. Stay good for me here at home. The butler will look after you, okay?” Averi, though young, felt the gravity of Sadie’s distress.
He gave a solemn nod, his small fingers gripping hers. “Mommy, please come back soon,” he whispered in his gentle voice.
Holding back her tears, Sadie kissed Averi’s forehead and hastened away with Noah through the gates of Myrtlewood Estate.
From a distance, the butler watched their departure, exhaling a soft sigh. In the car, Sadie’s grip on her phone was so tight that the veins on her hand protruded, her complexion ghostly pale.
Despite her deep breaths, the turmoil within her refused to subside. Her vision clouded with tears that cascaded down her pale cheeks. Softly, she whispered, “Grandma…” The thought of losing Laura was unbearable to her.
With one hand on the steering wheel, Noah reached out with the other to cover Sadie’s chilly hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “We’re nearly there. Don’t be scared,” he murmured, his voice a gentle balm. Gripping his hand as if clinging to a lifeline, Sadie silently implored for Laura’s safety.
Outside, the landscape blurred as they sped forward. At last, the car jerked to a stop outside Laura’s apartment building. Barely pausing, Sadie flung open the door and raced up the steps, Noah right on her heels.

###Chapter 321:
Lexi, anxiety clear on her face, was waiting. She rushed toward Sadie, saying, “You’re here, Sadie! Mrs. Stewart is still in the bedroom.” Without pausing for questions, Sadie rushed into the bedroom.
Laura was lying on the bed, her complexion ghostly pale, her breaths faint. “Grandma!” exclaimed Sadie, rushing to the bedside, her hands shaking as she grasped Laura’s.
Noah didn’t hesitate; he immediately called 911. He calmly said, “The ambulance is coming. We need to move your grandma gently off the bed.”
Working together, Sadie and Lexi delicately maneuvered Laura, lifting her to carry her downstairs. Noah went downstairs first to ensure the security team cleared a path for the ambulance’s arrival.
Soon after, the ambulance arrived, and paramedics swiftly transferred Laura onto a stretcher. Throughout the ordeal, Sadie stayed glued to Laura’s side, following each move.
Turning to one of the medics, she inquired, “Doctor, how is she?”
“The situation is still unclear. We’ll conduct more tests at the hospital,” responded the doctor.
With urgency, the ambulance then sped toward the hospital.noveldrama
Inside the ambulance, Sadie kept a firm hold on Laura’s hand, her heart silently calling for a miracle. Next to her, Noah sat, his face a mask of calm with underlying concern. Back at the apartment, Lexi lingered by the door, her hands clasped tightly, her anxiety evident.
As the ambulance faded into the night, she finally managed to compose herself enough to dial Alex’s number. The phone barely rang twice before he answered.
“Hello, Lexi, what’s the matter?” Alex’s weary voice came through, laced with a hint of worry.
L?tτ chɑρτ?rs ιn glov.
“Mr. Howe, it’s Mrs. Stewart. She…” Lexi’s words were stifled by her emotions, as she struggled to articulate the gravity of the situation.
“What happened to her? Please, breathe and explain what occurred,” replied Alex, his voice tightening.
“Mrs. Stewart fainted. A man and Sadie have taken her to the hospital,” Lexi responded, her voice faltering.
A pause filled the other end before Alex spoke again, his voice unsteady. “Tell me which hospital they’re at. I’m heading there right now.”
With urgency, Lexi relayed the name of the hospital, feeling her anxiety mount. She was uncertain if contacting Alex had been the correct decision. But in her view, Alex—Laura’s future grandson-in-law and father to Averi—deserved to be fully informed.
The identity of the man with Sadie earlier remained a mystery to her, and considering the late hour, it seemed quite unsafe for Sadie to be with him. Once the call ended, Lexi began to pace the living room, anxiety causing her heart to race.
In the hushed atmosphere of the hospital’s emergency room entrance, Sadie murmured, “Grandma…”
A pair of warm hands gently pulled her into a comforting embrace. Noah’s presence steadied her in the midst of uncertainty. She leaned into him, her head resting on his chest, seeking solace.
“Everything will be okay,” he reassured her, his hand gently stroking her back.
Silently, Sadie gripped his lapel, her knuckles pale with tension. Her tears soaked his shirt quietly as they fell. In those moments, her thoughts were consumed by Laura; overwhelmed by the dread of losing her. Noah’s support was crucial to her right then.

###Chapter 322:
As they waited, time seemed to crawl. The emergency room lights remained on.
The stillness was shattered by the sound of quick steps echoing down the hallway. Alex rushed to the scene and was struck by the sight before him. Noah had Sadie in his arms, holding her tightly. That sight caused Alex deep pain.
He stopped short, with his planned words catching in his throat.
Catching sight of Alex, Sadie instinctively tried to withdraw from Noah’s embrace. Noah’s face became cold, and he held her even tighter, as if silently declaring she was his. He shot a chilly look at Alex and asked him, “What brings you to the hospital so late, Mr. Howe?”
A shadow fell over Alex’s face. Torn by his emotions, he stared at Sadie. “Sadie, how is your grandma?”
Just as Sadie was about to respond, Noah cut her off sharply, saying, “This has nothing to do with you, Mr. Howe.”
Alex balled his hands into fists. “You seem very considerate, Mr. Wall, but I wonder, is Laura familiar with you? You might just add to her distress.” At that moment, Noah’s expression soured, but before he could reply, the emergency room doors swung open.
A doctor in a white coat stepped out, mask in hand. “The patient’s condition is very unstable. We need to transfer her to the ICU immediately. Who here is a family member? I need a signature now.”
Hearing this, Sadie wavered as if all her strength had been drained. She staggered over to the doctor, her hands shaking as she accepted the pen and paper. Tears clouded her eyes, making it hard to see as she signed; her grip on the pen was so unsteady it nearly fell.
“Sadie…” Alex began, moving to assist her.
Yet, Noah was quicker, stepping in to steady her by the shoulders. “Don’t worry. I’m right here.”noveldrama
I@te$t ￠#@pter$ In g@!novel$.c0m
“Get your hands off her, Noah!” Alex reached his breaking point.
Noah’s voice was thick with anger. “She’s my wife!” The tension between them grew sharper.
With her eyes shut tight, Sadie tried to find her inner calm. Suddenly, she jerked away from Noah, her voice raspy with emotion. “Stop it! Both of you, go back. I’m staying here with Grandma.”
Noah’s hands froze in mid-air, his face a mask of mixed feelings as he stared at Sadie. A look of pain swept over Alex, yet he remained silent. A heavy silence fell over them.
“I’m not going anywhere.” Noah broke the silence first, his eyes fixed on Sadie with no room for protests.
Alex stood his ground as well. “If he stays, then I’m staying too.”
Opening her eyes slowly, Sadie exhaled a frail sigh. The dispute around her lost all its meaning. While Laura fought valiantly for her life, Sadie found herself too drained to deal with them.
She pressed her back against the wall for support and shut her eyes once more. Neither Noah nor Alex spoke another word.
Silently, they remained by Sadie’s side, offering their quiet presence.
At a different location, Kyla’s frustration was evident as she slammed a few design drafts down on the table, her anger piercing through her impeccable makeup. The delicate crystal ornaments nearby quivered gently.
Before, regardless of his schedule, Noah would never neglect her for this long. However, Sadie’s return and subsequent move into Myrtlewood Estate had altered everything significantly.

###Chapter 323:
“Damn that bitch Sadie!” Kyla hissed, clenching her teeth in rage. Her restlessness had her pacing the room relentlessly.
Suddenly, the light from her phone pierced the tension in the room. A news alert flashed on the screen—“Wall Group’s CEO Spotted at a Hospital Late at Night, Reportedly with an Unidentified Woman.” This news only soured Kyla’s mood further. She snatched up her phone to inspect the news more closely.noveldrama
The photo was unclear, capturing just a man’s back, tall and commanding—clearly Noah. The woman beside him was indistinct, yet her slender figure sent a chill through Kyla.
“Could this be Sadie?” Kyla froze, her breath hitching.
A wave of discomfort overwhelmed her, tightening her chest with anxiety.
Kyla zoomed in on the image, scrutinizing the woman’s silhouette, the cut of her outfit, and the length of her hair. The longer she examined it, the more it looked like Sadie.
“No way! That’s impossible!” she muttered, refusing to believe what she saw. Why would Noah be at the hospital with Sadie? What had transpired between them?
No. She needed to find out herself!
Jamming the brakes, Kyla shoved open the car door, her stilettos clicking sharply against the pavement. She nearly lost her balance but quickly steadied herself.
She strode into the bustling downtown hospital.
From afar, her eyes locked onto a familiar figure standing by the ICU entrance—Noah.
He carried himself with his usual poise and grace, yet something about him felt completely foreign to her.
Every tale finds a home at g?lnσνs?com
Next to him stood Alex and… Sadie.
Kyla’s breath hitched.
All three of them together? What was going on? How shameless Sadie could be? A wave of irritation surged through her. No, she couldn’t just storm over recklessly.
Fishing a compact from her purse, she flipped it open and meticulously applied powder to her face until it appeared deathly pale.
Then, she ran a fingertip over her lipstick, smudging it slightly to give herself a frail, sickly look.
Taking a slow, uneven breath, she staggered toward the ICU entrance, her movements deliberately weak.
Reaching the group, she coughed softly twice, her body swaying as though she might collapse.
Noah turned, his brows knitting together at the sight of her.
“Kyla? What are you doing here?”
Feigning shock, Kyla covered her mouth. “Noah? You’re here too? I wasn’t feeling well, so I came to see a doctor.”
She leaned against the wall, her gaze flitting among the three people as if puzzled by the situation.
“So… what’s going on?” she asked, her tone laced with curiosity.
Alex, supporting Sadie, gave her a hard-to-read look but remained silent. Noah’s expression darkened as he glanced toward the closed ICU door, his lips pressing into a firm line.

###Chapter 324:
“Just a private matter,” he replied curtly, showing no interest in elaborating.
Kyla’s chest tightened. Swallowing her frustration, she kept up the act. “Oh… I understand.” She let out another feeble cough, her face growing even paler. “I-I should probably go see the doctor now.”
Turning unsteadily, she began walking away, though her eyes flashed with something venomous the moment she glanced at Sadie.
Her steps were so feeble it seemed she might collapse at any second.
Biting her lip, she forced a fragile smile, her voice trembling as though she was on the verge of tears.
“Noah… I feel dizzy. I-I can’t walk…”
Her words were barely above a whisper, light enough to be carried away by the air.
She shot a discreet look at Sadie, a glint of triumph in her eyes.
There was no doubt in her mind—Noah would drop everything and escort her to the doctor.
Sadie’s heart clenched.
She lowered her gaze, her long lashes masking the emotions swirling beneath them.
To her, Kyla was Noah’s priority. There was no way he would leave her behind. Sadie’s fingers curled into tight fists, her nails digging into her palms. The sting reminded her to stay composed.
Alex, watching Kyla’s performance, narrowed his eyes in silent disdain.
His grip on Sadie’s arm tightened.
Let your mind wander with g?lnσν?s﹒
Noah studied Kyla, his frown deepening.
A heavy stillness settled over them, thick with tension.
After several seconds of silence, Noah finally spoke, his voice cool and detached.noveldrama
“Nurse!”
A nurse hurried over. “Mr. Wall, how can I assist you?”
Without shifting his focus, he gestured toward Kyla. “Escort Miss Wade to her doctor.”
Kyla’s expression froze.
She stared at him, stunned.
This was supposed to be her moment—her chance to draw Noah away from Sadie. Yet, instead of rushing to her side, he had dismissed her without hesitation.
Swallowing her disappointment, she forced a faint smile at the nurse. “Sorry to trouble you.”
The nurse took her arm, leading her away.
Even as she walked, Kyla kept glancing back at Noah, hoping for a sign—any sign—that he cared.
But his eyes never wavered from the ICU door, not sparing her even a second’s glance.
As she finally disappeared down the hallway, the suffocating tension in the air seemed to ease ever so slightly.
Sadie sat on a bench just outside the ICU, her limbs heavy with fatigue. A day and night of worry had sapped her of all energy, both physically and mentally.

###Chapter 325:
Finally, the click of the ICU door opening cut through the hushed corridor as the afternoon sun streamed in, casting long shadows. A doctor, his face lined with exhaustion, emerged and removed his mask, revealing a faint smile. “The patient’s condition has stabilized. We can move her to the VIP ward now,” he announced, his voice tinged with cautious optimism.
A profound sense of relief washed over Sadie, lightening the burdensome weight that had clung to her shoulders. Her body, though drained, flooded with a transient strength at the news.
“That’s such wonderful news!” Beside her, Alex exhaled deeply, the tension in his shoulders unwinding as he processed the doctor’s words. His face softened, the lines of strain smoothing into relief.
Later, in the quieter, more comfortable setting of the VIP ward, Sadie remained a constant vigil at Laura’s bedside.
When Laura’s eyelids fluttered open, revealing her clouded gaze, she squinted, trying to bring the familiar faces into focus. When she recognized Sadie and Alex, a frail smile tugged at her lips. “Sadie… and Alex,” she murmured, her voice hoarse but filled with warmth.
Sadie grasped her grandmother’s hand, her eyes glistening with tears that threatened to spill. “Grandma, you’re awake! How are you feeling?” she asked, her voice thick with emotion.noveldrama
Laura responded with a tender pat on the back of Sadie’s hand, her touch light but reassuring. “I’m feeling much better now, sweetheart. No need to worry,” she said, her voice as gentle as a warm embrace.
As she turned her attention to Alex, her eyes shimmered with gratitude. “Thank you for everything, Alex.”
Alex’s response was a warm, comforting smile. “It’s what I should do, Laura. Please rest well,” he replied, his voice soft yet firm.
Just then, the room’s atmosphere shifted subtly as Noah entered.
Dressed in a well-tailored suit that accentuated his dignified and elegant demeanor, Noah approached the bedside with a respectful nod.
Laura gazed at Noah, her eyebrows knitting together in visible confusion. She turned toward Alex, her voice tinged with uncertainty. “Alex, who is this?” The room plummeted into a heavy silence. Both Sadie and Alex stiffened, their eyes fixed on Noah.
Sadie felt her heart hammering against her chest, unsure of how to unveil her complicated ties with Noah or how Laura would react. In a moment of panic, she blurted out, “He, um, he’s just a friend.”
“Friend?” Laura’s voice carried a note of skepticism, her eyes clouding over with doubt as she scrutinized Noah and then Sadie, as if piecing together a puzzle. Her wrinkled hand tenderly brushed the back of Sadie’s. “A friend, huh.”
Noah remained still, his complexion ashen, his lips a tight line, jaw clenched in tension. He remained silent, his intense gaze locked on Sadie, laden with unsaid emotions.
Sadie, overwhelmed, avoided his piercing stare and focused on the reassuring warmth of Laura’s hand in hers, her palms slick with sweat. She could feel Noah’s eyes on her, their sharpness slicing through the heavy air around her, making her entire frame tense with discomfort.
The oppressive silence hung thickly around them until Laura exhaled a soft sigh, her touch on Sadie’s hand gentle yet firm. “Sadie, you’re an adult now, and it’s not my place to dictate your choices. Just promise me you’ll be careful and protect your heart.” 
.

###Chapter 326:
Sadie’s nose twitched, a telltale sign that she was on the verge of tears. Her voice caught as she nodded, barely managing to whisper, “I get it, Grandma.” Behind her, Noah remained silent, his presence like a shadow.
With a long, piercing gaze that seemed to search her soul, he turned abruptly and departed from the ward, his footsteps echoing in the stark silence. Sadie felt a pang of emptiness as he left, the sterile scent of disinfectant suddenly suffocating.
She walked out softly, her footsteps barely making a sound in the deserted corridor—Noah was nowhere to be seen. Her gaze lingered on the desolate stretch before her, a heavy, unspoken sorrow settling in her chest.
She blinked fiercely, battling the surge of tears threatening to spill.
“Sadie.” Alex’s voice, warm with concern, broke through her reverie.
She turned, a strained smile tugging at her lips. “Alex, why haven’t you left yet?”
Alex’s heart constricted at the sight of her forced cheerfulness, a sharp pang twisting inside him. He closed the distance between them, his voice a gentle murmur. “Your grandma is alright now, and that’s a relief for both of us. But if there’s anything I can do for you, just let me know.”
His words were tentative, and he was mindful of her fragile state. It was clear to him that Sadie was deeply affected by Noah’s abrupt departure, the shadow of which seemed to linger around her like a cold mist.
Sadie nodded appreciatively. “Thank you, Alex.”
“It’s nothing,” he replied, his voice low. A pause followed, during which Alex’s gaze lingered on her slightly reddened eyes. “Are you sure you’re fine?” he asked, concern weaving through his words.noveldrama
Sadie fought to mask the pain flashing in her eyes. “Don’t worry, I’m just a little tired. You should get going before it gets any later.”
Alex seemed to wrestle with his words, ultimately choosing silence.
Lɑττ cнαρτ?rs n glov?l.o
Sadie turned away, her footsteps echoing softly as she returned to the ward. She picked up an apple and started peeling it for Laura, but her hands fumbled, leaving the skin to fall in uneven, ragged strips.
Laura, half-reclining in her hospital bed, watched Sadie with kind eyes that carried a hint of worry.
“My dear, you’re so distracted that you can’t even peel an apple properly. What’s troubling you?” Laura inquired gently.
Jolted back to the present, Sadie quickly masked her emotions with a forced smile. “Nothing, really. I’m just tired, that’s all.” She handed over the clumsily peeled apple.
Laura accepted it and nibbled thoughtfully, her gaze never straying from Sadie’s face. “Sweetheart, I can see right through you. Does this have something to do with Mr. Wall?” Her voice was soft yet probing.
Sadie’s fingers twitched involuntarily, and her eyes flickered with a hint of something unspoken. “Grandma, he’s just… a good friend.”
Laura’s response was light, yet pointed. “Would just a good friend go to the lengths of transferring me to this VIP ward and ensuring the finest doctors were at my side?”
Her words hung in the air, a gentle but incisive challenge to Sadie’s dismissals.
The sharp scent of disinfectant permeated the ward, tightening Sadie’s chest with discomfort.
Laura’s probing gaze intensified Sadie’s anxiety, making it difficult for her to remain composed.

###Chapter 327:
Doing her best to steady her trembling voice, Sadie reassured her, “Don’t overthink it, Grandma.”
“Sadie, I’m getting old and not much help anymore. I just want to see you well,” Laura said softly, her tone shifting into a gentle plea. “Well… does Mr. Wall treat you well?”
At this, Sadie’s posture stiffened momentarily. She gripped the curtain beside her so tightly that her knuckles turned white. “Grandma, your health is my only concern right now. We can talk about everything else later, okay?”
“My sweetheart,” Laura sighed, her voice tinged with resignation. “You’re always like this—trying to handle everything on your own. I know you’re strong, but some things aren’t meant to be borne alone.”
Sadie closed her eyes, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill.
She turned to face Laura and forced a smile. “I’m really okay. Don’t worry about me. I’ll take good care of myself, and take good care of you too.”
Laura observed Sadie’s strained smile and, with a pained shake of her head, chose not to press further.
Sadie then returned to the bedside, picked up another apple, and began peeling it.
Her movements were slower and more deliberate this time, the peel falling away thin and even.
Yet her hand still trembled slightly, betraying her inner turmoil.
Meanwhile, Noah pushed open the front door of his villa to be met with a cold, desolate atmosphere.
The silence in the empty living room was so profound he could almost hear his own breathing.

He removed his coat and tossed it casually onto the sofa, a frown etching his brow.
“Isn’t there something… off today?” he mused aloud.
Breck, the butler, paused his polishing of an antique vase and glanced around, then shook his head in confusion. “No, Mr. Wall, nothing seems out of place.” Noah walked over to the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing down at the garden under the night sky, his voice tinged with barely noticeable irritation. “I mean…”
Breck suddenly realized what was going on, setting down the cloth he was holding. “Oh, Mrs. Wall has been at the hospital these past few days caring for her grandmother and hasn’t returned yet.”
Noah’s gaze shifted to a small figure eating alone in the dining room. A cold smile flickered at the corner of his mouth. “How trusting of her… leaving her child here all alone.”
He walked purposefully into the dining room.
Averi was eating his cereal methodically, one spoonful at a time. His little face appeared calm, but his eyes reflected a profound loneliness.
Hearing the footsteps, he looked up. When he saw Noah, he swallowed his mouthful of cereal and said softly, “Mom used to take me to KFC every Saturday for a treat.”
His voice was quiet, almost wistful.
Noah looked into Averi’s eyes—so reminiscent of Sadie—and felt a surge of mixed emotions.
After a brief pause, he sighed, his tone unexpectedly gentle. “Let’s go. Today I’ll take you there.”

###Chapter 328:
Averi’s face brightened, and a smile spread across his features as he quickly set down his bowl and spoon. “Really?”
Noah simply nodded, reached out, and tousled Averi’s hair. “Finish your meal first, then we’ll go. Make sure to clear your bowl.”
Averi nodded enthusiastically, eagerly resuming his meal, his face glowing with anticipation.noveldrama
Noah observed him with a complex expression.
At KFC, the scent of fried chicken enveloped them. Averi sat across from Noah, happily gripping a chicken leg, his face shiny with grease.
Noah studied the boy, and for a moment, a gentle softness crossed his face as a slight smile emerged.
He was rarely seen in such informal settings. His crisp, business-like attire stood out in the casual atmosphere of the fast-food restaurant.
“This is so good!” Averi exclaimed, holding up a half-eaten chicken leg enthusiastically.
“Take your time. No one’s going to take it from you,” Noah said, pulling out a tissue to gently wipe the grease from Averi’s mouth.
In a quiet corner of the restaurant, Jordyn’s eyes landed on the unexpected scene.
She had only come to grab an ice cream and had never imagined she’d stumble upon Noah here.
Noah was with a child?
Jordyn narrowed her eyes, studying Noah and the boy across from him. She recognized Noah, the prominent CEO of Wall Group, but the child seemed familiar too.
Lаtt chɑpt?rs ?n glnοv?ls.ο
Acting on a hunch, Jordyn discreetly pulled out her phone, aimed it at Averi, and snapped a photo.
Once she captured the image, she swiftly opened WhatsApp, located the contact, and sent the photo along with a message. “Guess who I saw at KFC?” After sending it, Jordyn anxiously watched her phone screen, her heart pounding.
Meanwhile, Noah was oblivious to the fact that he’d been photographed. He was focused on teaching Averi how to use ketchup properly.
“Squeeze it out like this. Be careful not to get it on your clothes,” he instructed.
“Got it,” Averi replied, concentrating as he mimicked Noah’s actions, carefully squeezing ketchup onto his fries.
Watching Averi’s focused demeanor, Noah felt an unexpected warmth wash over him. Maybe bringing Averi to KFC was indeed a good idea.
Back in her apartment, Kyla stared intently at the photo on her phone. The man in the picture was a side of Noah she had never seen before.
“Impossible…” she murmured, her fingers trembling as she zoomed in on Averi’s face, which grew clearer by the second.
A cold shiver ran down her spine.
“It’s him… that bastard…” Kyla’s voice was shaky, the words barely escaping her clenched teeth.
Could it be that Noah already knew? Did he know that Averi was his son? Was that why he continued to endure Sadie’s presence, even taking the time to go to KFC with the boy?
In a sudden fury, Kyla sprang to her feet, spilling her coffee. The hot liquid splashed onto her leg, but she barely flinched.

###Chapter 329:
“Sadie, you bitch!” Kyla growled, throwing her phone onto the sofa.
She began to pace, agitation mounting with each step. “No, I can’t just sit here and do nothing!” Kyla stopped abruptly.
“Noah is mine—mine alone! No one will ever take him from me!”
Seizing her handbag, she stormed out of the door, driven by rage.
At KFC, while Noah and Averi were still enjoying their meal, a figure approached their table.
“Noah, what a coincidence—you’re here too,” Kyla said, her smile strained, her eyes fixed intently on Averi.
Noah’s brow furrowed slightly as he responded coolly, “Mm.”
Ignoring Noah’s reserved reaction, Kyla walked straight up to Averi, crouched down, and spoke in an overly sweet tone. “Hey there, little one, what’s your name?”
Averi eyed her warily and moved closer to Noah without responding.
“Don’t be scared. I’m a friend of Noah,” Kyla continued, still smiling as she reached out to pat Averi’s head.
Averi ducked away from her hand, gripping Noah’s arm tightly, and stated in a small, firm voice, “I don’t like this lady.”
For a moment, Kyla’s smile froze, but she quickly recovered, masking her irritation. “Oh, you’re such a shy little one.”
She then pulled a neatly wrapped toy from her purse. “I brought you a gift. Do you like it?”
Averi glanced at the toy but shook his head and retreated behind Noah, his voice soft yet resolute. “My mom said not to take things from strangers.” Kyla’s expression darkened momentarily. She hadn’t anticipated such a direct rejection from Averi.
L?t?st chαpt?rs ιn glovе.?
Attempting to maintain her composure, she insisted, “I’m not a stranger.”
“Anyway, I don’t know you!” Averi retorted loudly, his face flushing with emotion.
Noah, observing Averi’s defensive reaction, felt a surge of protectiveness. He tousled Averi’s hair affectionately and addressed Kyla firmly. “We’ve got to go.”noveldrama
With that, he took Averi’s hand and swiftly exited KFC.
Kyla stood frozen for a moment, watching their retreating backs, her forced smile dissolving into a look of sheer venom. “Sadie, just you wait!” Kyla hissed through clenched teeth, her fist so tightly balled that her fingernails dug into her palm.
Noah, with Averi’s hand securely in his, walked out of KFC with deliberate, long strides.
Behind them, Kyla’s resentful gaze followed, igniting a flicker of annoyance within him.
“That lady is so scary,” Averi murmured in a small, frightened voice, gripping Noah’s hand more tightly.
As Noah looked down at the child, his expression softened.
He offered a reassuring smile and said gently, “Don’t worry, I’m here.” Just as he spoke, a sharp cry cut through the air.
Noah quickly turned around to see Kyla collapsing to the floor. Her high heels lay askew beside her, and blood flowed from a gash on her forehead down her cheek—a startling sight.

###Chapter 330:
A crowd began to form around her, murmurs rising.
Despite his exasperation with Kyla’s relentless meddling, the sight of her injured invoked a sense of concern in Noah.
He moved back towards Kyla without a second thought.
“Are you okay?” he asked as he approached her.
Kyla’s face was ghostly pale, and blood still trickled from the wound on her forehead.
Weakly, she reached out and clutched Noah’s sleeve, her voice shaking. “Noah… it hurts. Can you take me to the hospital?”
Noah looked down at her pained expression, hesitating.
His gaze then shifted to Averi, who was watching the scene unfold with wide, worried eyes.
“Mr. Wall…” Averi tugged gently at Noah’s sleeve, his voice tinged with concern.
Noah furrowed his brow and, after hesitating briefly, decided to take Kyla to the hospital.
He took out his phone and called Samuel. “Get to KFC right away and take Averi back to the Myrtlewood Estate.”
After a brief pause, Samuel responded, “You’re at KFC right now, Mr. Wall? Should I bring anything?”
“Just hurry over,” Noah replied, ending the call and turning his attention to Averi. “Averi, I need to take her to the hospital. You’ll go home with Samuel later, okay?”noveldrama
Averi, young but understanding the gravity of the situation, nodded. “Okay. You should hurry.”
When Kyla heard Noah’s plan, joy washed over her.
Exclusive updates available g?lnσνs?com
She clutched Noah’s arm, whispering, “Noah, thank you.” Noah said nothing in reply.
As the minutes passed, Samuel arrived at KFC.
He spotted Noah and Kyla seated, with Averi standing close by.
“Sorry, Mr. Wall. Traffic held me up,” Samuel apologized as he approached.
“No problem, just take Averi home,” Noah directed, gesturing towards Averi.
Samuel nodded, crouched down by Averi, and asked, “Ready to go?” Averi looked from Noah to Kyla and then followed Samuel out of KFC.
Watching Averi leave stirred a blend of emotions in Noah.
“Noah…” Kyla’s voice pulled him from his thoughts.
“Let’s go to the hospital,” Noah said, helping Kyla to her feet and guiding her towards the exit.
He assisted her into the car and then climbed in beside her.
The car pulled away, heading for the hospital.
Inside, the air was tense.
Kyla rested against the seat, her complexion pale.
The scent of disinfectant filled the space.
The doctor treated Kyla’s wound with precision, eliciting soft gasps from her.
“All done,” the doctor announced, securing the bandage and removing his gloves. “It’s not a deep wound. Just keep it dry and change the dressing regularly to prevent scarring.”

###Chapter 331:
Kyla offered a weak smile. “Thank you.”
Noah stood by, silent and contemplative.
As he turned to leave, Kyla swiftly caught the hem of his shirt with her slender fingers.
Kyla was determined not to let this chance escape her.
“Noah,” she murmured, her voice carrying a plea, weak yet clear. “Could you stay with me for a while? I feel a bit scared.”
Noah paused, his eyes flickering with uncertainty as he faced her.
“Just for a bit,” Kyla said, sensing his reluctance.
With a deep sigh, Noah acquiesced.
He moved to the chair next to her bed and sat down, his eyes resting on her.
“Alright,” he said.
A hush fell over the room.
Kyla remained silent on the bed, her eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. After a lengthy silence, she said, “Noah, do you remember our times together before?”
Noah stayed quiet, absorbing her words.
“Back then, we were so young.” She reminisced, pausing to gather her thoughts. “I felt as though I was on top of the world.” A crease formed on Noah’s forehead.
“Then we drifted apart…” Kyla’s voice wavered with emotion. “I moved abroad, and the space between us widened.”
“Kyla,” Noah interjected, his tone resolute. “We need to leave the past behind.”
“I can’t seem to forget,” Kyla confessed, turning to face him, her eyes brimming with tears as she met his gaze.
Your escape is on g ? ln σ ν s?com
“I’ve never stopped loving you, Noah…” Kyla’s voice quivered, raw and vulnerable. “Every day, I wonder if you’ll come back to me… if we could have another chance.”
Noah exhaled, his gaze lingering on her for a moment—impassive, detached.
“Could you find it in your heart to… give me one more chance?” Kyla’s eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she looked at him, searching for even the smallest flicker of warmth. “Please, Noah,” she whispered. “I swear I’ll be better this time. I’ll take care of you, love you the way you deserve. I will—”
“Kyla.” Noah’s voice cut through her desperate pleas like a blade—steady, final. “There is no going back.”
A sharp breath hitched in Kyla’s throat before the tears came, spilling down her cheeks. She covered her face with trembling hands, sobs breaking through the last of her composure.
“Get some rest.”
With that, Noah turned and strode out of the ward without looking back. Kyla’s tears seeped into the pillow as she bit down on her trembling lower lip, trying in vain to suppress the sobs wracking her body.
“Why… why…” The words fell from her lips in a broken whisper, barely audible over the sound of her own shuddering breath.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this.noveldrama
Suddenly, she gripped the blanket tightly, nails digging so deeply into the soft fabric that her knuckles turned white.
“Sadie! This is all because of you!” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 332:
If Sadie had never come back, Noah wouldn’t be like this—so cold, so distant. He was supposed to be hers. He should shield her and protect her. Not Sadie. Never Sadie.
“I won’t give up. I will never give up!” she snarled, her voice thick with determination.
Meanwhile, Sadie approached the hospital entrance, carrying a thermal lunch box.
Laura had been in the hospital for some time now, and today Sadie had gone out of her way to bring her favorite pot roast and fish soup—something warm, something comforting.
But as she stepped closer to the hospital entrance, her steps faltered. A familiar black luxury car was parked there. Noah. Her pulse quickened unexpectedly.
What was he doing here?
Shaking off the unease, Sadie walked through the hallways until she reached Laura’s ward.
Just as she was about to step inside, a familiar low voice drifted through the door. “You don’t need to worry. I’ll make sure you get the best doctors. Whatever it takes.”
Sadie froze. Pushing the door open, she took in the sight before her. Noah was seated beside Laura’s bed, his gaze soft, his voice full of quiet reassurance.
“Ah, there you are!” Laura’s face brightened with a warm smile the moment she saw Sadie step in.
Noah turned as well, his gaze landing on her.
For a fleeting second, their eyes met—charged with something unspoken, something electric.
M ?ρ  ν.noveldrama
Sadie hesitated at the doorway, caught off guard by the sudden wave of emotions stirring inside her. But she quickly steadied herself, forcing down whatever it was threatening to surface.
She stepped forward, setting the thermal lunch box on the bedside table.
“How are you feeling, Grandma?” she asked gently.
Laura gave her hand a reassuring pat. “Much better,” she said, her voice filled with warmth. “I only just realized how lucky I am. Noah helped arrange my transfer to this ward. The doctors and nurses here are incredible. They’ve been taking such good care of me.”
Sadie’s fingers curled slightly, her gaze drifting toward Noah before she could stop herself.
He stood off to the side, silent but present. When he heard what Laura said, a barely perceptible smile touched his lips—so fleeting, it almost wasn’t there.
“Yes… Mr. Wall has been very considerate.” Her voice held a touch of stiffness, betraying the emotions she was still trying to suppress.
Noah’s eyes met hers again, filled with something she couldn’t quite decipher. “It was the least I could do,” he replied, his tone calm, devoid of any sentiment. Silence settled over the room. The faint scent of disinfectant mixed with the comforting aroma of the food Sadie had brought—a strange, almost surreal contrast.
After a beat, Noah turned to Laura. “Get some rest. I’ll be going now.”
Laura nodded. “Take care on the road.”
With a brief nod, Noah turned and strode out of the room.
“Sadie, why don’t you walk Noah out?” Laura’s voice was light but firm. 
.

###Chapter 333:
Sadie hesitated. “But, Grandma…”
Laura smiled knowingly, patting Sadie’s hand. “Go on. He’s a good kid.”
For a brief moment, Sadie considered refusing. But under Laura’s gentle yet insistent gaze, she sighed and gave a small nod.
She stepped out of the ward and spotted Noah walking in the hallway, his posture rigid, his back carrying an air of quiet solitude.
As if sensing her presence, he turned. Their eyes met.
“Is there something you—”
Sadie shifted slightly. “My grandma asked me to see you off.”
Noah was silent for a beat, then gave a small nod.
They walked side by side down the hallway, neither saying a word. The quiet between them stretched, thick with unspoken thoughts.
Sadie finally broke it. “Thank you.”
Noah didn’t slow his steps. “It’s nothing.” His tone was calm, almost dismissive.
“I, um…” Sadie hesitated, wanting to say something—anything—but the words tangled in her throat.
Before she could gather her thoughts, a sudden ringtone shattered the tense silence between them.
She instinctively reached for her phone. Her heart skipped a beat when she saw the caller ID: Breck.
“Hello?”
Breck’s slightly hesitant voice came through the line. “Mrs. Wall, Averi hasn’t returned yet. Did Mr. Wall take him to the hospital after eating at KFC? Are they with you?”

Sadie’s breath hitched. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a cold chill creeping down her spine.
Her gaze darted to Noah, panic flickering in her eyes.
Noah, sensing something was wrong, furrowed his brows.
“Averi’s not with me.” Sadie’s grip on the phone tightened.
She struggled to steady herself, forcing her breath to even out.
“He’s not there?” Breck’s concern deepened. “That’s strange… Mr. Wall took Averi out for KFC this afternoon, but he never came back.”noveldrama
Sadie’s breathing turned shallow, and her thoughts spiraled into a blur.
Averi was missing!
The realization hit Sadie like a punch to the gut, knocking the breath from her lungs. She locked eyes with Noah, and his expression immediately shifted to one of grave concern.
Without a word, he took the phone from Sadie’s grasp, his tone steady and firm. “Don’t worry. I’ll check immediately.”
As soon as the call ended, he swiftly contacted Samuel. “Where is Averi? Wasn’t he brought back?”
A frantic voice answered on the other end, “Mr. Wall, I swear I followed your orders! I dropped him off at Myrtlewood Estate and watched him go inside before I left. I… I have no idea where he went after that!”
Noah’s expression hardened. “Myrtlewood Estate? Are you absolutely certain?”
“Yes! I saw him enter with my own eyes!” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 334:
Noah abruptly ended the call, his jaw tightening. He turned toward Sadie, his gaze unreadable.
A wave of dizziness washed over her, and she nearly collapsed. “How could this happen? Where is he?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.
Noah gripped her arm, his voice urgent. “Stay calm. I’ll send a team to search immediately.” Sadie gave a weak nod, barely able to hold herself together.
Without wasting any more time, Noah dialed security. “Pull up all surveillance footage from Myrtlewood Estate. I need to see Averi’s last known movements in ten minutes.”
Without another word, he strode out of the hospital.
Sadie clenched her hands into fists, the thought of what might have happened to Averi unbearable.
Just then, Kyla emerged from the emergency room, her complexion pale, a thick bandage wrapped around her head. She had intended to leave, but she was surprised to see Sadie there. When she noticed Sadie’s distressed state, a smug smirk played on her lips.
She deliberately slowed her steps, stopping just in front of Sadie.
“Well, look who it is. What’s wrong, Sadie?”
Sadie’s head snapped up, her teary and reddened eyes glaring at Kyla.
Seeing the raw emotion in Sadie’s eyes only fueled Kyla’s satisfaction. She tilted her head, her voice dripping with mockery. “So, it seems Noah doesn’t care much about you or that brat. Look at me—I got a minor injury, and he rushed me to the hospital himself. Meanwhile, your precious son? Left in the care of an assistant.”
Sadie’s breath hitched.
So this was what had happened!
g?lnσνs﹒o is where stories livenoveldrama
Kyla chuckled, her tone laced with cruelty. “What’s wrong? Did that sting? Feeling pathetic? Too bad. Noah’s heart belongs to me. You’ll never be anything more than a placeholder.”
Sadie trembled, her clenched fists turning ghostly white.
Kyla relished the reaction, lifting her chin as she strutted away, pleased with herself.
Sadie stood frozen, her body wavering, on the verge of collapse. She staggered back a step, barely steadying herself. Her vision blurred, her strength threatening to give out.
But she couldn’t break down. Averi was still missing. She had to find him! Summoning every ounce of willpower, she spun around and bolted from the hospital.
She had to find him!
She flagged down a taxi and urgently gave her old address.
The moment the vehicle stopped, she practically flung the door open and dashed inside. She sprinted up the stairs, fumbling with her keys before unlocking the door.
The apartment was empty and silent.
Without wasting a second, she rushed to Laura’s unit. Still no sign of him. Panic surged through her as she stumbled outside, standing helplessly by the curb. She had no idea where to go next.
Just then, a sleek black Maybach rolled to a stop in front of her.
The door opened, and Noah stepped out. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 335:
His face was etched with worry, his brows knitted in frustration. The moment he saw Sadie, he closed the distance between them.
Their eyes met, and the emotions Sadie had been suppressing erupted all at once. She screamed, her voice raw with desperation, “Where’s Averi? Where is my son?!”
Noah halted, something unreadable flickering in his gaze.
“I’m looking for him,” he murmured, his voice rough and exhausted.
“Looking?” Sadie’s breath came in ragged gasps as she choked out, tears spilling down her cheeks.
“Was it because of Kyla?” Sadie’s voice was sharp, accusatory. “Because she got hurt, you just threw Averi aside?!” Her eyes bored into Noah, demanding answers.
Noah’s jaw tightened, his expression clouding over. Silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating.
“I didn’t throw him aside,” he finally muttered. “Samuel took him home. It’s just…”
“Just what?” Fury overtook Sadie. She seized Noah’s collar, yanking him closer.
“Just that you were too busy taking care of your girlfriend to care about me,” she spat.
Noah’s face went rigid. “Sadie…”
Sadie staggered backward, her legs giving way as she crumpled to the ground. Her hands covered her face, muffling the sob that tore from her throat. “You don’t care about him at all,” she choked out, her voice breaking. “All that matters to you is Kyla. No matter what I do, no matter what Averi does, we’ll never mean as much to you as she does.”
All this time, she had clung to the belief that somewhere in Noah’s heart, there was a place for her and Averi, that he felt something—anything—for them.
But she had been wrong. It had been nothing more than a cruel illusion. The storm of emotions raging in her heart might have meant nothing to him—but her lips trembled as she sobbed, the weight of it all crushing her.

Noah said nothing. He simply stepped forward, his arms encircling her, lifting her from the cold ground and pulling her into a firm embrace.
“Sadie, I’m going to find him and bring him back to you,” his voice was low, steady. “I swear.”
Sadie’s breath hitched as she struggled against his hold, shoving at his chest. “Let go of me!” Her voice was raw, thick with anguish.
But he only held her tighter, his chin resting gently against her head. “I won’t let go—neither of you,” he whispered, as if it was all he had left to cling to.
Suddenly, a sharp ringtone sliced through the tense air.
Noah tensed before lifting his phone.
“Mr. Wall,” someone said on the other end, voice hushed but urgent. “Earlier this evening, Mrs. Isabel Wall arrived at the Myrtlewood Estate, saw Averi, and took him with her.”
The words hit Sadie like a physical blow. Her head snapped up, eyes wide with shock and growing rage.
“Isabel!” The name left Sadie’s lips like a curse. She was trembling with fury and disbelief.

###Chapter 336:
Noah’s face darkened. He ended the call and gripped Sadie’s hand tightly. “Let’s go!” A shiver crawled down Sadie’s spine, leaving her momentarily frozen. What did Isabel want from Averi?
Neither Sadie nor Noah spoke during the drive. The silence in the car was thick, suffocating.
The sleek black vehicle came to a smooth stop before Wall Manor. Without hesitation, they stepped out, pushing open the heavy, carved wooden doors.
Laughter spilled from the living room, warm and lively, completely at odds with the turmoil in Sadie’s chest.
“Averi, have another bite—ah!” Isabel’s voice was dripping with affection. “It’s so sweet!” Averi’s delighted giggle followed, his tiny voice light and carefree.
Isabel’s laughter rang out, full and unguarded, making her seem years younger. Sadie’s heart clenched. “Averi!” she called out.
The laughter died instantly. Isabel’s head snapped up. The moment her eyes landed on Sadie, her face darkened.
“You again?” Her voice was sharp, venomous. She turned to Noah, eyes blazing. “Why did you bring this jinx here again?”
Sadie’s breath hitched, her face draining of color. Noah’s brows knitted together, his stance shifting as he instinctively positioned himself in front of her.
“Mom, why is Averi here with you?”
Isabel looked perplexed for a moment, her affectionate eyes resting on Averi’s adorable features. She said, “I discovered this child by the gate of the Myrtlewood Estate. I intended to visit you today, but then I found him there, so alone and forlorn, and I felt compelled to bring him home.”
Her gaze shifted to Sadie, her face hardening instantly. “Why are you here again? You just won’t leave. Listen to me, give up! Our family cannot accept a person like you!”
Noah started to respond, his brow furrowed in disapproval, but Averi’s voice cut him off, saying, “Mrs. Wall, please don’t be angry with my mommy!” Clutching Isabel’s hand, Averi looked up earnestly, his large eyes brimming with sincerity.

Isabel paused, her expression of anger momentarily frozen. Turning her gaze from Averi’s earnest face to Sadie, Isabel appeared bewildered.
“Mommy?” Isabel echoed, her voice tinged with astonishment. “Are you his mother?”
With a shaky voice, Sadie answered, “Yes, I am.”
A heavy silence then settled over the room. Isabel’s face cycled through emotions rapidly: shock gave way to confusion, which in turn yielded to disbelief. Her gaze then fell on Noah, laden with inquiry and scrutiny.
Noah, for his part, bore a complex look. Gazing at Sadie and Averi, he remained silent, his lips sealed shut.
Breaking the heavy silence, Sadie said, “It’s late. I’ll take Averi home now.” She was eager to leave without delay.noveldrama
Gently, she lifted Averi into her arms, and he clung to her, his face hidden in the crook of her neck.
Sadie moved toward the exit. Upon reaching the door, she paused. Without turning around, she murmured, “Sorry for the intrusion.”
With those words, she departed, not looking back. The moment Sadie vanished from view, Isabel whirled to face Noah, her eyes alight with a fierce intensity. “Noah, I need to know—Is that child yours?” Noah remained still, rooted to the spot. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 337:
Isabel’s frustration mounted as he failed to reply. “Have you lost your voice?! Answer me! Is that your child?!” Finally, Noah looked at Isabel. He took a deep breath before replying, “It’s late, Mom. You should go to bed.”
Isabel got angry, pointing a finger toward Noah. “What is this response? I demand to know—is that child…” Noah, pretending he didn’t hear anything, turned and made his way to the door.
“Stop, Noah!”
He halted, his head angling slightly. “I have things to attend to.” Continuing, he opened the door and strode out toward his car without a backward glance. The door slammed loudly, echoing through the room as Isabel stood shaking with rage.
The darkness of the night enveloped everything. Clutching Averi, Sadie treaded carefully down the cobblestone pathway. Abruptly, a sleek black Maybach halted before her. As the window descended, a strikingly handsome face appeared.
“Come inside.”
Sadie remained silent, frozen in place with Averi in her arms. Noah’s intense, inscrutable eyes were fixed on her.
“I won’t ask again.”
Reluctantly, Sadie climbed into the car with Averi. The engine hummed to life as the car glided through the night.
The air inside the car was oppressively thick, making each breath a struggle. Noah kept his gaze fixed on the road, enveloped in silence. Sadie sat quietly, her gaze lowered, cradling Averi.
Meanwhile, at Wall Manor, lights still blazed in the living room. Isabel’s face was stormy as she sat on the sofa, her demeanor frightening. The butler remained close by, too afraid to utter a word.noveldrama
“Check on that child! I want every detail,” Isabel commanded, her voice cutting through the silence as she pounded on the table.
Your favorite tales are on gα?ησν?sоnn
“Right away,” the butler replied promptly.
As Isabel remained seated, her eyes betrayed a flicker of doubt. She had yearned for a grandchild for many years. Should this child prove to be a Wall, there was no way he could be ignored, given his good manners and charm.
The next morning, a small collection of dinosaur figurines lay scattered in the corner of the sofa.
Draped in an elegant beige ensemble, Kyla moved with poise into the living room, a pristine Hermes Birkin dangling from her arm. As always, a soft, composed smile adorned her face. Yet, the moment her eyes landed on the toys, that expression faltered.
“What… what is this?” she asked, gesturing toward the toys.
Nearby, the butler had been carefully polishing an antique vase. Upon hearing Kyla’s voice, he set it aside and answered with deference, “Miss Wade, those belong to Miss Hudson’s child. He was here last night.”
“Miss Hudson’s child?” Kyla froze, a flood of questions crashing into her mind. Sadie had come to Wall Manor with her child?
“What exactly happened?” Kyla’s voice remained measured, but beneath the surface, unease swirled.
The butler hesitated, aware of the trust Isabel placed in Kyla. After a brief pause, he chose to be forthright. He recounted the events of the previous evening before adding, “Mrs. Wall has instructed me to look into the child’s origins—to determine if he is Mr. Wall’s son.”

###Chapter 338:
Kyla’s stomach twisted. She had never anticipated things to escalate to this point. Sadie had not only come to the manor with her child, but now Isabel was actively seeking confirmation of his parentage.
“Where is Mrs. Wall now?” Kyla managed to keep her voice steady, masking the turmoil within.
“She is in the garden, taking a walk,” the butler replied respectfully.
“I see. You may carry on with your tasks.” With a small wave, Kyla dismissed him.
The butler gave a slight nod before returning to his duties.
Kyla remained where she stood, her eyes fixed on the abandoned toys. Had all her meticulous efforts been for nothing? If Isabel found out the boy was Noah’s, what leverage would she have left?
Isabel had long desired a grandchild. The moment she confirmed Averi’s parentage, she would stop at nothing to ensure his place in the Wall family.
No. Kyla clenched her fists. She couldn’t allow that to happen.
Outside, the garden was in full bloom, the scent of fresh petals wafting through the air—yet it did nothing to calm her rising anxiety.
Seated in a wicker chair, Isabel absent-mindedly twirled the bracelet on her wrist, her gaze distant, lost in thought. She didn’t even notice Kyla’s presence. Stepping forward, Kyla called gently, “Isabel.” There was no response.
A bit louder this time, Kyla tried again. “Isabel?”noveldrama
At last, Isabel stirred from her thoughts, her expression vacant as she looked up. “Oh, Kyla. I didn’t see you there.”
Kyla forced a pleasant expression. “Is something wrong? You seem troubled.”
Isabel exhaled and rubbed her temples.

A twinge of unease gripped Kyla. Carefully, she probed, “Is it because of… the boy?”
Another weary sigh escaped Isabel’s lips. She wasn’t surprised Kyla knew.
Meeting Kyla’s gaze directly, Isabel said firmly, “Let me be clear—if that child is my grandson, he will be brought back where he belongs. But don’t worry, Kyla, you are still the one I’ve chosen for Noah. No one can take that from you.” She paused, then added, “When the time comes, I’ll ensure Sadie leaves. She will be compensated well, but the boy will stay—and he will be raised by you.”
A suffocating pressure gripped Kyla’s chest, leaving her breathless.
Raising Sadie’s child? Why?
Her every action had been calculated to secure her place as Noah’s wife, the future matriarch of the Wall family—not to become a guardian for someone else’s son!
“Well…” Kyla struggled to steady her voice, searching for the right words.
But Isabel didn’t let her finish. “I know you have a kind heart, and I know how much you’ve longed for a child of your own. Just think of this as doing me a favor. I’m getting older, and all I want is to have a grandchild.”
Swallowing her resentment, Kyla forced a smile—one that felt more painful than any tears. “Of course. I’ll do as you ask.”
Pleased, Isabel patted Kyla’s hand. “That’s my girl. I knew you’d understand.” Lowering her gaze, Kyla concealed the storm raging inside her. She would not surrender so easily.
Stepping out of Wall Manor, she approached a black Mercedes parked by the curb. The chauffeur promptly exited and opened the door. “Miss Wade.”

###Chapter 339:
Sliding into the seat, Kyla tugged at her collar, irritation simmering beneath her skin. “Drive.”
The vehicle eased onto the road, leaving the estate behind.
“Keep a close watch on Sadie and her child. I want to know their every move.”
“Understood, Miss Wade,” the driver replied quietly.
Kyla shut her eyes. She would not allow them to ruin everything she had built!
One day, Sadie quietly got out of bed and changed into a simple beige outfit.
The shock of Averi’s recent disappearance had kept her on edge for the past few days. She insisted on taking him to and from kindergarten herself, every single day.
“Mom, we have crafts class today at kindergarten. I’m going to make a toy car to give to Mr. Wall!” Averi was seated at the table, his short legs dangling over his chair as he spoke with excitement. His plump little face was beaming as he poked at the bowl of food in front of him with his spoon.
Sadie smiled and reached out to wipe some stains from the corner of his mouth. “All right. I’ll get to see your masterpiece when I pick you up this afternoon.”
After dropping Averi off at kindergarten, Sadie drove to the studio.
The atmosphere at the studio was still rather depressing, as most of the employees had left for Wall Group.
“Miss Hudson, the Starlight Gala has been postponed,” Nanette said as she knocked on the office door and entered with a piece of paper in hand. “It’s now scheduled for next month.”
Sadie, in the middle of revising a design, frowned and put the draft down. “Postponed? Did they say why?”
“Apparently, a big-shot guest will attend then. But the organizers haven’t revealed who it is yet.” Nanette placed the file on Sadie’s desk. “This is the updated schedule for the event.”
Sadie glanced at it before saying, “Got it. For now, just focus on the work at hand.”
She was preoccupied not only by the studio’s current operations but Averi’s safety as well. She didn’t have more attention to spare for the Starlight Gala.noveldrama
“Oh, and one more thing.” Nanette paused in her tracks to look back at Sadie. “Ms. Shaw has asked about the pieces for the Dewy Hibiscus series several times now. How about sending them over this afternoon?”
“Sure. You can take the pieces to Stonemont Estate yourself.” Sadie nodded, adding, “Be careful with Ms. Shaw’s order. Make sure there are no mistakes.”
“Understood, Miss Hudson,” Nanette replied before exiting the office.
Sadie leaned back in her chair and massaged her temples. She was tired. There had been so many events lately, and all the hustle and bustle was taking a toll on her.
When noon rolled around, Sadie headed to the hospital to visit Laura. Thankfully, the old lady’s condition was improving significantly.
“Sadie, you’ve been working too hard lately. You need to rest,” Laura chided as she took Sadie’s hand and squeezed it.
“I’m fine, Grandma,” Sadie said with a forced smile. “Don’t worry. I’m taking care of myself.”
Later on, as she was leaving the hospital, Sadie felt a heavy weight settle in her heart.
She buried herself in work as soon as she returned to the studio.

###Chapter 340:
“Miss Hudson, I’m heading to Stonemont Estate.” Nanette stood at the door of Sadie’s office, holding a package containing the Dewy Hibiscus series.
“Drive safely,” Sadie called out without looking up from her desk.
After Nanette left, the studio became even quieter. The only sound that could be heard was the ticking of the clock and the occasional taps on the keyboard. Sadie’s focus was on her computer screen as she pored over design after design.
Her concentration was broken when her phone chimed with a new WhatsApp message.
It was from Amy.
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat, and a keen sense of foreboding came over her.
She hadn’t had much contact with Amy since she left Majestic Ego.
Sadie opened the message and froze as she processed the words Amy had sent. “Vivi resigned.” Vivi?
Sadie’s breath hitched, and her fingers instinctively tightened around her mouse.
Vivi had been her rival back at Majestic Ego and had always been hostile towards her. After Sadie left, Vivi had wasted no time taking over her position as the lead designer.
Why would Vivi resign out of the blue?
Sadie’s heart began to race as her thoughts became a tangled mess.
Was there trouble at Majestic Ego, or was Vivi moving on to something else? “It can’t be…” Sadie muttered to herself, even as she struggled to dismiss the suspicions that formed in her mind. Try as she might, however, that feeling of unease from earlier seemed to rush back in full force.
She quickly typed out a reply for Amy. “What happened? Do you know why she resigned?”
ЯE P?ΛTΞ? IИ GΛ?И?VΞ.
Sadie hit send and stared at her phone screen intently. The rhythmic ticking of the clock only served to heighten her anxiety. And then—Ding!
Sadie frantically opened the new message.
Amy’s reply was short. “She’s returning to her home country, your country.” Vivi was coming back?
It felt like a bucket of ice had fallen over Sadie’s head. The timing of Vivi’s return… It couldn’t have been a mere coincidence.
“Thank you,” Sadie typed with trembling fingers.
Needless to say, Vivi’s return was not good news for her.
She glanced at the time; Averi’s classes were about to be dismissed. She needed to pick him up.
Sadie saved her revisions and closed her computer. Then she grabbed her purse and coat and left the studio, her mind still a jumbled mess.
As Sadie and Averi left the kindergarten, their hands intertwined, Averi clutched a handmade pinwheel. It spun with each skip he took, his laughter filling the air. “Look, Mommy! See how fast my pinwheel spins?” Averi shouted joyfully, holding it up.
Warmly, Sadie smiled and tousled his hair. “It truly is amazing. You’re so talented, Averi!”
However, the sudden ringing of her phone interrupted their moment. With a slight sense of dread, Sadie glanced at her phone, seeing Nanette’s name on the caller ID. noveldrama

###Chapter 341:
“Hello, Nanette?”
Nanette’s voice, heavy with tears, barely made it through the line. A tightness formed in Sadie’s chest. “Sadie… Boohoo…”
“Nanette, what’s happened? Calm down and talk to me,” Sadie said, her concern audible.
“It’s Dewy Hibiscus… they are broken… Boohoo… What do we do now?” Nanette said through her tears.
“Broken? How on earth did that happen?”
Tears uncontrollably escaped Nanette as she stammered, “I was just… I bumped into someone from Wall Group… He was also delivering jewelry… Boohoo…”
Maintaining her composure was a struggle for Sadie.
“Take a breath, Nanette. What exactly did the Wall Group staff member do?”
“He pushed me… and then… the jewelry pieces fell and shattered… Boohoo… Sadie, what should we do now?”
Paleness washed over Sadie’s face swiftly.
Could it have been Kyla’s subordinate?
Deliberate, not accidental, she suspected.
“Nanette, tell me where you are. Stay calm. I’m coming to you.”
“I’m still at Stonemont Estate…”
“Stay there. I’m on my way.”
After ending the call, Sadie knelt to meet Averi’s gaze, managing a reassuring smile. “Honey, Mommy has to handle something important quickly. We’re going to make a stop first, alright?”
Averi responded with a nod, his voice soft, “Okay, Mommy.”
Don’t miss out gα?ησνls?c?m
With urgency, Sadie sped towards Stonemont Estate. The shattered Dewy Hibiscus had been intended as the grand showpieces for the upcoming Starlight Gala, representing countless hours of effort from her team. What were they to do now with them in pieces? This had Wall Group’s fingerprints all over it.
Sadie’s resolve hardened; she wouldn’t let them get away with this.
Upon reaching Stonemont Estate, she found Nanette by the entrance, sobbing uncontrollably. Swiftly, Sadie approached and enveloped Nanette in a warm embrace, soothing her with gentle pats on the back. “Don’t worry, Nanette. I’m here now.”
Tears streaked Nanette’s cheeks as she gazed up at Sadie, her face a mask of sorrow. “Sadie, what are we going to do?”
The sight of Nanette’s despair wrenched Sadie’s heart.
“Show me where it happened.”
Nanette guided Sadie to the scene, where the remnants of gemstones lay scattered like colorful tears on the ground. What had once been the magnificent Dewy Hibiscus now lay in ruins.
A sharp pain twisted in Sadie’s chest, cutting deeper with every breath. “Where is the Wall Group staff member?” she asked.
“There,” Nanette said, pointing towards a man in a suit nearby.
Turning her attention to where Nanette pointed, Sadie observed the man engaged in a phone conversation, his back to them. His build and stance struck a familiar chord in Sadie as she squinted, trying to make out his features. noveldrama

###Chapter 342:
The moment he turned, Sadie’s eyes narrowed.
There stood Percy Webster, Kyla’s right-hand man.
As Percy ended his phone conversation, a self-satisfied smirk appeared on his face. He approached Sadie and Nanette, jewelry box in hand, the lid slightly open, revealing hints of the treasure inside.
“Enough with the drama already,” Percy said arrogantly, scanning Sadie and Nanette with evident disdain. “Look, I never laid a finger on her. She’s the one who dropped it, and now she wants to blame me? Really, know your place.”
As her tears streamed down her face, Nanette replied, “That’s a lie. You definitely pushed me. I had the Dewy Hibiscus in my hands, and you just barged into me. There was no chance for me to even react.”
Percy snorted mockingly, his face contorted with scorn. “Be careful with your accusations, young lady. Words like those can land you in hot water. Best to own up to your own clumsiness now, or you’ll find yourself deeply regretting it later.”
Nanette recoiled, her hand gripping Sadie’s arm for support.
As Sadie’s face turned stormier by the second, she barely contained her rising anger. “What are you implying, Percy Webster?”noveldrama
Undeterred, Percy locked eyes with Sadie, his smirk growing. “It’s quite straightforward. Your employee caused the damage herself and now she points the finger at me, correct?”
He gazed at Nanette dismissively, his voice laden with derision. “Quite attractive for someone so clumsy, aren’t you? If you’re aiming to climb the ladder, try a more legitimate approach.”
Nanette’s cheeks burned with humiliation and rage at the overt insult, and she cried even louder than before.
Nanette accused Percy, “You… you have no shame!” Her body quivered as she pointed at him, consumed by fury.
Ltst chptrs in gαlovels.c?m
Sadie’s patience had worn thin with Percy’s arrogance and insults, pushing her to her limit.
In a swift motion, she snatched the jewelry box from Percy’s grasp and hurled it to the ground. The box hit the ground with a sharp snap, breaking apart and scattering its contents, including a diamond necklace, which clinked noisily as it rolled across the ground.
A look of horror washed over Percy’s face as he scrambled to gather the diamonds. “Have you lost your mind? Do you realize the value of these?!”
Standing over him with a steely gaze, Sadie said, “Percy, I will make sure you face the consequences for your actions!”
The butler at Stonemont Estate, alerted by the noise, hurried to the scene, shocked by what he saw. He stepped forward, eager to understand the disturbance.
“Miss Hudson, what… what has occurred here?” The butler’s tone was urgent as he surveyed the chaotic scene.
“Just in time, sir. This man deliberately destroyed my pieces and then proceeded to berate my team member!” Sadie explained, her voice cold as she accused Percy.
While Percy was still desperately gathering the scattered diamonds, he abruptly raised his head, his eyes burning with animosity towards Sadie. “You’re falsely accusing me—”
“Enough!” Sadie interrupted him sharply. “The truth is clear to everyone. Please, sir, call the police immediately.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 343:
The color drained from Percy’s face as he hadn’t anticipated Sadie would involve law enforcement.
In a state of panic, he leapt to his feet, attempting to intercept the butler. “Please, don’t… don’t call the police! It was not intentional.”noveldrama
Sadie scoffed loudly. “Not intentional, you say? Do you honestly expect me to fall for that? I will pursue this matter to the very end!”
Percy was too slow to prevent the butler from acting; he watched helplessly as the butler dialed the police, clearly explaining the incident and their location. Percy’s expression turned grim. With a look of intense loathing, he bared his teeth and hissed, “Just you wait— you’ll regret this!”
He then hastily retrieved his phone and dialed Kyla. Once the call connected, Percy didn’t dare admit to damaging Sadie’s jewelry. Instead, he twisted the truth, casting all the blame on Sadie.
“Miss Wade, you must get to Stonemont Estate immediately! Sadie has lost her mind! She’s made a huge scene and smashed the jewelry box I brought. Now, she’s trying to have me arrested! You need to come and sort this out!”
On the other end of the line, Kyla’s anger ignited. “What?! I’m on my way!”
Kyla quickly disconnected the call and hurried towards Stonemont Estate. Images of Sadie’s indifferent expression played in Kyla’s mind, igniting a spark of jealousy. She resolved that Sadie wouldn’t get away with acting so superior!
The atmosphere was charged with tension at the entrance of Stonemont Estate. Calm and composed, Sadie and Nanette stood to one side, seemingly in control of the situation. Contrastingly, Percy was visibly agitated, pacing back and forth and continuously checking the entrance in anticipation of Kyla’s arrival.
The police arrived promptly and set about evaluating the circumstances, beginning by questioning those present.
The butler was the first to testify, offering a thorough recount of the incident.
galησνe?s.c?m is your update source
“Upon hearing the disturbance, I immediately rushed there. I encountered Mr. Webster and Miss Hudson amidst a dispute, surrounded by the remnants of shattered jewelry boxes and loose diamonds. Mr. Webster accused Miss Hudson of breaking his jewelry box, whereas Miss Hudson insisted that an intentional bump from Mr. Webster led to her employee dropping their box.”
The police then turned their attention to Percy. “Mr. Webster, what is your response?”
Nervously shifting his gaze, Percy attempted to maintain a calm demeanor. “She intentionally smashed my box! I didn’t even touch her!”
Just then, Kyla arrived, her tone filled with anger. “What’s happening here? Who’s harassing my assistant?!”
Percy, seeing his boss arrive, quickly approached her, his expression one of distress. “I’m so relieved you’re here, Miss Wade!”
Kyla then fixed her intense glare on Sadie, her voice cutting and confrontational. “Sadie, this is too much! What gives you the right to do something like this?!”
With a composed and cold smile, Sadie replied smoothly, “Miss Wade, perhaps you should get your facts straight first. Your assistant intentionally bumped into my employee, causing her to drop our jewelry box. We’re actually the injured party here.”
“That’s absurd!” Kyla exclaimed, pointing accusingly at Sadie, her features twisted in fury. “You’re just trying to create trouble! Percy would never behave like that!”
Sadie’s expression cooled, her words firm. “The police will handle the investigation. But I’m curious, Miss Wade, why do you so passionately defend your assistant? Is there something between you two?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 344:
Kyla was caught off guard, left without words by Sadie’s sharp challenge. She hadn’t anticipated such a forceful and articulate defense from Sadie. Meanwhile, police officers took statements from witnesses and reviewed security footage from the estate.
The video clearly depicted Percy bumping into Nanette, which led her to drop the jewelry box inadvertently. This indisputable evidence caused both Percy’s and Kyla’s complexions to blanch.
“The evidence is quite clear,” Sadie said, her voice calm yet incisive. “Miss Wade, do you have any further comments?”
Kyla found herself speechless, unprepared for Sadie’s tactical shrewdness and comprehensive handling of the situation.
Kyla wobbled, her complexion turning ghostly white. With a hand over her heart, she emitted a soft, feeble moan. Then, she fell backward.
Percy was swift to react, catching her just before she hit the ground. His expression was one of sheer alarm as he shouted, “Miss Wade! Miss Wade, can you hear me?” Chaos ensued at once.
Observing Kyla’s theatrical display, Sadie couldn’t help but scoff inwardly. So typical, the same old trick.
Her eyes grew cold as she mockingly inquired, “Miss Wade, do you need medical assistance? Should I call for an ambulance?”
Percy glared at Sadie with intense loathing, as if she were a notorious criminal. “You’ve caused this. Miss Wade wouldn’t be in this state if it weren’t for your provocation.”
Unruffled, Sadie responded with a tone of mock surprise, “How is this related to me? I only said a few words. I never touched her. Surely, if her condition is this delicate, the blame can’t possibly fall on me.”
She then addressed the butler, her demeanor calm. “Please, could you call for an ambulance? It seems wise to be cautious.” Though the butler was suspicious of Kyla’s abrupt faint, he quickly made the call to emergency services without hesitation.
Fresh updates loaded gα?ησν?s?c?mnoveldrama
“No need for an ambulance,” Percy replied abruptly, cutting through the tension with a sharp voice. “I’ll take her to the hospital myself.” With Kyla in his arms, he swiftly departed the scene.
Sadie’s lips curled into a knowing smirk as she watched them hurry away, sensing their fear of exposure.
Turning to Nanette, she suggested, “Let’s depart now.”
“But…” Nanette hesitated, glancing at the ruined Dewy Hibiscus on the ground.
“The police will take care of it,” Sadie assured her with conviction. “We should head back.”
She then bent down to collect the scattered jewelry fragments, each one tenderly placed into a velvet pouch.
The fragments, though broken, retained their immense worth. Not merely a masterpiece, the Dewy Hibiscus symbolized Sadie’s dedication and dreams.
Nanette observed Sadie meticulously collecting the pieces, her admiration for her calm and composed demeanor growing amidst the ordeal. Such was the essence of true strength.
They left Stonemont Estate behind and approached the car parked nearby. Inside, Averi was deeply engaged with a toy. Upon noticing Sadie entering the car, he set his toy aside and leapt into her embrace, his voice tender and concerned. “Mommy, are you alright?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 345:
Embracing her son, Sadie felt a surge of comfort. “I’m alright, my love,” she reassured him softly, caressing his hair. “I’m sorry if I worried you.”
Averi tightened his embrace, pressing a kiss to her cheek. “I love you more than anything, Mommy.”
Joy lit up Sadie’s face at his words. With Averi close, she felt ready to face any challenge.
As the car started, it gradually moved away from Stonemont Estate. Sadie watched through the rearview mirror as the estate dwindled behind them. Inside, she steeled herself, resolved to make Kyla pay for what happened today. Her grip on the steering wheel tightened, eyes fixed on the road ahead. Next to her, Nanette shifted uneasily in the passenger seat, glancing at Sadie, her mouth opening and closing without words.
Eventually, Nanette’s restraint broke, her voice quivering. “Sadie, what are we going to do?”
Sadie remained silent for a moment, inhaling deeply before she let out a slow exhale.
“We’ll know,” she finally responded.
“But…” Nanette began, only to be interrupted.
“Listen, I understand your concerns,” Sadie said, offering a calming glance. “I’ve poured my heart and soul into every detail of Dewy Hibiscus. I’m more heartbroken than anyone for its ruin. Trust me, I’ll handle this.”
Nanette nibbled on her bottom lip, falling silent.
A hush fell over the car again, broken only by the engine’s gentle purr slicing through the night.noveldrama
When they finally arrived at Nanette’s home, Sadie said to her, “Head inside. Rest up.”
“Take care of yourself too, Sadie,” Nanette responded, nodding in acknowledgment before she exited the vehicle.
At her doorstep, she lingered, watching as Sadie’s car faded into the night, silently wishing for her friend’s success and safety.
Sadie placed the broken pieces of Dewy Hibiscus into a meticulously crafted wooden box. Her frequent handling had polished the box’s edges, reflecting her calm exterior despite the emotional turbulence within.
“I must find an expert capable of mending this,” she muttered.
For the following two days, Sadie scoured the city, visiting every esteemed jeweler and antique shop she could find. Yet, she encountered the same verdict everywhere. Restoration was nearly impossible.
“Is repair really an impossibility?” Sadie’s grip on the box tightened, her knuckles whitening. “There has to be a way.”
She expanded her search through every conceivable network.
At last, a promising lead emerged: Lionel Morgan, a reclusive but supremely skilled jeweler whose abilities were nearly mythical.
Tracking down Lionel’s residence proved challenging. His home was a remote villa on the city’s outskirts, nestled in isolation.
Sadie made her way there, her journey marked by serpentine mountain roads framed by stunning vistas that did little to soothe her nerves.
“Knock. Knock. Knock…” She knocked on the door of the villa.
The door was answered by an elderly butler who scrutinized her. “May I help you, ma’am?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 346:
Sadie was direct. “I need to speak with Mr. Lionel Morgan regarding a jewelry repair.”
The butler paused, cautious. “Have you scheduled an appointment?”
“I haven’t managed to secure one,” Sadie said. “However, I have with me fragments of the Dewy Hibiscus, which might interest Mr. Morgan.”
As soon as Sadie opened the box, the pieces shimmered subtly in the sunlight, their former luxury peeking through.
Moved by the fragments’ latent beauty and Sadie’s earnestness, the butler eventually invited her in.
Lionel scrutinized the pieces with intense focus, his expression one of deep thought. “Such exquisite workmanship… it’s truly tragic.”
“Is there any possibility of restoration?” Sadie inquired, her voice tinged with hope.
Regrettably, Lionel shook his head. “The challenge is formidable. The Dewy Hibiscus was crafted with highly specialized techniques and rare materials, which are now almost unobtainable,” he explained.
Feeling disheartened yet still holding on to a flicker of hope, Sadie pressed, “Is there absolutely no possibility?”
After a thoughtful pause, Lionel responded, “Restoration might be feasible, albeit with slim odds. I’m willing to attempt it, though success isn’t assured.”noveldrama
Brightened by even the slightest chance, Sadie replied enthusiastically, “Your willingness to try means everything to me.”
Lionel hesitated before adding, “There’s a condition, though. Repairing it might be possible, but it would require sourcing scarce substitutes for the original materials. These are exceptionally difficult to find, and it would demand considerable effort on your part.”
Immediately, Sadie responded with determination, “Please list the materials you need. I’ll move heaven and earth to get them.”
Lαττ ?нαρτ?rs ιn glov?l.om
Lionel provided a list of the gemstones required, each one rarer than the last.
Upon departing from the villa, Sadie wasted no time initiating her quest. She reached out to every known jeweler and collector, leveraging all her contacts. Meanwhile, she tasked Nanette with overseeing the studio’s ongoing projects to maintain uninterrupted operations.
Watching Sadie in constant motion, Nanette expressed her concerns. “Sadie, is it wise to manage so many tasks simultaneously? Aren’t you concerned about the strain?”
“The Dewy Hibiscus is too precious to me; I must restore it, yet the studio cannot afford to pause. We need to balance both,” Sadie explained resolutely.
In the ensuing days, Sadie dedicated herself to acquiring the necessary materials and assisting in the restoration efforts of the Dewy Hibiscus. Her efforts were relentless, mirroring the non-stop operation of a well-oiled machine.
As the Starlight Gala approached, Sadie had successfully secured almost all the needed materials. However, the Starlight Stone remained elusive, its rarity making it almost mythical.
“Starlight Stone,” Sadie whispered, her gaze fixed on the last unchecked item on her list.
“Ring, ring, ring…” The studio’s telephone echoed with persistent ringing.
Nanette answered it, her face tensing as the call unfolded. “Hello, Sadie’s Studio… What? Cancel the collaboration? Why?”
Nanette’s disbelief was evident in her elevated tone. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 347:
Once the call ended, she quickly approached Sadie, worry etched across her features. “Sadie, we have a problem.”
Putting aside the design draft, Sadie met Nanette’s gaze. “What’s going on?”
“Our partners have been calling to withdraw from their agreements with us,” Nanette said, her voice quivering.
A cold shiver ran through Sadie as dread took hold. “Why are they pulling out?”
“They said our studio’s reputation is compromised; they’re accusing us of copying designs, and…” Nanette paused, finding it difficult to proceed.
Sadie, sensing the gravity, urged her on. “What else?”
Nanette whispered, almost inaudibly, “They said your personal life is in disarray, which is damaging our studio’s reputation.”
Color drained from Sadie’s face as she tightened her grip on her pen, her knuckles turning white. “Who is behind these rumors?”
Nanette shook her head, her expression one of despair. “I’m not sure. They kept their sources confidential.”
Sadie fought to keep her emotions in check. “Got it. Let’s make sure our other partners feel secure for now. I’ll find out what’s really going on here.”
“Got it.” Nanette nodded and left the office.
Sadie leaned back in her chair, her brows knitted as her mind raced with endless possibilities. Then a name suddenly popped into her head—Kyla. She couldn’t think of anyone else devious and determined enough to ruin her life.
“I’ll see what you’re really up to!” Sadie muttered.
She grabbed her phone and made a call. “Hello, Leif. I need you to help me with something…”
gα?ησνs?com is your story source
Sadie recounted everything to Leif and asked him to trace the source of all the rumors as quickly as he possibly could.
Shortly after she hung up, her phone rang. It was Eva.
“Sadie? I heard there’s been trouble with your studio. Is that true?” Eva’s voice was filled with concern.
“Yeah,” Sadie said with a small sigh.
“Don’t worry! I’ve already had someone investigate the matter,” Eva reassured her. “I’m sure we’ll have answers soon.”
“Thank you,” Sadie said sincerely.
Eva just chuckled and brushed it off. “Please, don’t mention it. By the way, we can’t have any room for mistakes during the Starlight Gala. This mysterious person you’re meeting is a big shot in the design industry. You’ll get your chance to show off your skills.”
“I understand,” Sadie murmured.
When she ended the call, her heart felt heavier.
Meanwhile, in another part of the city, Kyla was sitting in a cafe across from Percy.
“How is everything going?”
“Everything is going according to plan, Miss Wade. I’ve spread the word far and wide in the world of jewelry. The reputation of Sadie’s studio has plummeted, and most of her partners have…”noveldrama
“Already canceled their impending collaborations.” Percy’s lips curled into a cunning smile.

###Chapter 348:
“Good.” Kyla nodded in satisfaction. “All that’s left for us to do is continue pressuring her from all sides. We must make sure that she never recovers from this.”
“No problem,” Percy replied readily. “I will follow your lead.”
Kyla picked up her cup and took a sip of her coffee. Her eyes glinted with malice as she stared off into the distance. “This time, Sadie, I will see to it that you disappear for good!”
It didn’t take long for Leif to report back to Sadie. “I’ve found the culprit, Miss Hudson. The person behind the rumors is named Percy Webster. He bribed several journalists to publish slanderous articles about your studio.”
“Percy…” Sadie’s eyes flashed. “Just as I thought.”
She took a deep breath and tapped her finger lightly against her desk. “Forward his report to the police.”
Nanette turned to her in surprise. “But…”
“With solid evidence on hand, the police will have no reason not to go after Percy,” Sadie said firmly. “They should be able to deal with him. Our priority right now is finding the Starlight Stone and fixing the Dewy Hibiscus.”
Nanette nodded and immediately contacted the authorities, while Sadie opened her computer and began to look for information on the Starlight Stone.
She was browsing on a certain website when a message popped up on the screen. A private auction was happening in three days at the Cloud Summit Club, and one of the items up for bidding was the Starlight Stone.
A flicker of hope sparked in Sadie’s chest, but it died out almost instantly. The Cloud Summit Club was a famous private club frequented by the elites. No one could get in without an invitation.
“Starlight Stone…” Sadie muttered to herself as she tried to work around this new setback.

Just then, the door to the studio opened, and Alex sauntered in.
“Hey, Sadie. What are you working on?” Traces of concern lined his face.
“I’m looking for the Starlight Stone,” Sadie replied with a faint smile.
“Starlight Stone? That’s a rare gem, isn’t it? It would be hard to get your hands on it.” Alex walked around her desk and glanced at the auction details that were still on her screen. “Cloud Summit Club… That place isn’t easy to get into, either.”
Sadie let out a defeated sigh. “Yeah, I know. But apart from this auction, I don’t know where to find the Starlight Stone.”
Alex gazed down at her troubled face for a moment, his expression slowly breaking into a mysterious smile. “As it happens, I’m going to attend the auction at the Cloud Summit Club.”
Sadie’s eyes brightened. “Really? Would you mind if I came along?”noveldrama
Alex caught the eager anticipation in her expression and offered a reassuring smile. “Of course not.”
Gratitude surged in Sadie, and she quickly responded, “Thanks so much, Alex!”
Alex observed her excitement, a warmth blossoming in his chest. “It’s no trouble at all; don’t mention it.”
Immediately, Sadie began to prepare for the upcoming auction. She diligently went through the auction catalog, noted the initial price for the Starlight Stone, and devised her strategy for bidding. Resolved, she muttered to herself, “The Starlight Stone will be mine.”

###Chapter 349:
Three days later, Sadie and Alex headed to the Cloud Summit Club. The club exuded grandeur, its opulence glowing.
“Are you nervous?” Alex whispered, picking up on the tightness in Sadie’s features.
“A bit,” Sadie replied, inhaling deeply to soothe her nerves. “The Starlight Stone is incredibly important to me.”
“Don’t worry, I’m here to help,” Alex assured her with a supportive glance.
Arm in arm with Alex, Sadie entered the lavishly decorated auction hall. Upon their entrance, her eyes roamed the room and landed on a face she recognized. It was Noah. He stood out among the attendees, clad in a sleek, impeccably fitted black suit, exuding an air of dignity and elegance.
Beside him was Kyla, wearing a flowing white evening gown. She stood close to Noah, her smile soft and tender.
Their gazes locked, and the atmosphere around them seemed to turn cold. Noah’s face quickly soured, his look becoming sharp and cutting.
He approached Sadie with confident, long strides, Kyla keeping pace beside him. “What brings you here, Sadie?” Noah inquired.
A heavy feeling settled in Sadie’s heart, and she instinctively tightened her hold on Alex’s arm. “I’m here to participate in the auction.”
“And who are you accompanying?” Noah’s eyes flicked to Sadie’s hand, which was on Alex’s arm, his expression growing colder.
“Alex, as you can see,” Sadie replied confidently.
Noah’s features turned even more severe. He took a firm hold of her wrist, his voice laden with authority. “You need to come with me.”

“I will not,” Sadie firmly said, pulling her wrist away from his grip.
“You…” Noah was incensed by her defiance. “You two…”
“Noah, calm down, please,” Kyla said in a soothing tone, her words appearing caring but subtly stoking the tensions. “Sadie is probably just here to experience a bit of luxury.” She paused, then seemingly casually added, “Alex has always treated Sadie well, after all.”
“Kyla Wade!” Sadie exploded, her rage ignited. “Stop trying to stir up trouble here!”
“You’ve got it wrong, Sadie,” Kyla replied, putting on a look of distress, her eyes beginning to tear up. “I just don’t like seeing you guys argue.”
“That’s enough!” Noah interjected, fixing his intense gaze on Sadie. “Once more, come with me.”
“I will not!” Sadie responded boldly, refusing to break eye contact. “Why should I follow your orders?”
“You…” Noah tensed up, his veins throbbing visibly.
“Noah,” Kyla said gently, tugging at his sleeve. “Perhaps Sadie simply doesn’t wish to leave Alex’s side. They…” She paused purposefully, shooting a pointed look at Sadie.
Feeling a rush of anger, Sadie struggled to maintain her composure.
“Enough, Kyla!” she said sternly, her teeth clenched.
Alex, no longer able to remain silent, stepped in front of Sadie and confronted Noah. “Mr. Wall, Sadie can make her own decisions. You should respect that.”
Noah glared at him coldly.

###Chapter 350:
“This is a family issue, Alex. You’d do well to keep out of it.”
“A family issue?” Alex scoffed. “Mr. Wall, are the ways you’ve been treating—”
“Sadie really just family matters’?”
“You…” Noah was close to exploding.
“Stop, Noah.” Kyla intervened once more, gently pulling at his arm. “The auction is about to start.”
Collecting himself with a deep breath, Noah controlled his anger. He shot Sadie a final, complex look, then walked away.
Kyla glanced back at Sadie with a look of victory before following Noah.
As Sadie watched them walk away, her emotions were a whirlwind.
“Are you okay?” Alex asked, his voice full of concern.
Sadie nodded slightly, mustering a smile. “I’m okay. Let’s go to the auction.”
Sadie had never expected to encounter Noah at this event.
Side by side, she and Alex proceeded to their seats.
The auction then officially kicked off.
Echoing through the hall, the auctioneer’s voice energetically announced each lot, while bidders eagerly snapped up item after item. Every gavel strike sent Sadie’s heart racing even faster.
She was anxiously anticipating the moment the Starlight Stone was presented.
“Coming next, the evening’s crown jewel—a 10-carat natural Starlight,” announced the auctioneer, unveiling a breathtakingly beautiful gemstone that dazzled the audience.
The stone’s deep blue hue shimmered, emitting six radiant beams that seemed to capture stars within its essence.

Sadie caught her breath, her heart squeezing tight; the Starlight Stone was finally before her.
“We’ll start the bidding at five million!”
“Six million!” someone called.
Without hesitation, Sadie raised her paddle. “Seven million!”noveldrama
Across the room, Kyla’s voice followed. “Eight million!” Her tone was full of challenge.
Turning sharply, Sadie locked eyes with Kyla.
Determined, she raised her paddle again. “Nine million!”
Kyla was relentless. “Ten million!”
Sadie felt the pressure but was undeterred, her hand shaking slightly. She knew Kyla was intentionally provoking her, yet she remained resolute.
“Eleven million!” Alex’s voice rang out, strong and supportive beside her.
Kyla, momentarily surprised by Alex’s intervention, quickly regained her poise and bid. “Twelve million!”
With a firm squeeze of Alex’s hand, Sadie expressed her deep appreciation through her gaze.
Alex didn’t falter, bidding again. “Thirteen million!”
Then, breaking through the escalating tension, Noah’s authoritative voice boomed. “Fifteen million!”
Murmurs swept through the room as all eyes turned in surprise to Noah, who had dramatically entered the bidding.

###Chapter 351:
Sadie felt a wave of disappointment. She hadn’t expected Noah to align with Kyla in the auction.
Softly, with a hint of appeal in her voice, Sadie said, “Noah…”
However, Noah paid her no heed, his eyes cold as they remained fixed on the auctioneer.
Alex, with determination etched on his face, raised his paddle again. “Eighteen million!”
Unyielding, Noah countered with a firm, “Twenty million!”
Pushing further, though his voice showed signs of strain, Alex bid, “Twenty-two million!”
Tension thickened in the air, with every attendee holding their breath in anticipation.
Noah decisively shouted, “Fifty million!”
Defeated, Alex put down his paddle, his shoulders drooping.
With a heavy thud, the auction gavel struck, announcing the final owner of the Starlight Stone.
Overwhelmed, Sadie sank back into her seat, her complexion washed out as if the energy had been drained from her.
Concern painted Alex’s face as he looked at her, at a loss for words on how to provide solace.
Behind the stage, Kyla clutched the ornate box with the Starlight Stone, her expression radiant with victory.
She drew closer to Noah, whispering, “Thank you, Noah.”

Taking the box, Noah lifted the lid to peer at the luminous stone within. He spoke without emotion. “This gem wasn’t bought for you.”
A chill swept through Kyla as her smile stiffened, her voice trembling. “What did you say?”
With a snap, Noah shut the box and began to walk away. “You should understand that I never had any romantic feelings for you.”
Kyla’s complexion turned pale, her fingers tightening around the crushed velvet clutch.
Alex wore an expression of remorse as he said, “Sadie, I’m sorry. I couldn’t secure the Starlight Stone for you.”
With a feeble smile, Sadie shook her head and responded, “It’s okay, Alex. You’re not to blame. I appreciate all your efforts.”
Pain filled Alex as he observed her attempt to stay composed.
“Let’s go,” Sadie said as she stood.
Together, they exited the auction hall, walking shoulder to shoulder. A night breeze brushed against Sadie’s face, yet it failed to blow off the cold in her heart.
The loss of the Starlight Stone indefinitely postponed the revival of the “Dewy Hibiscus” series, and her studio’s crisis remained unresolved.
“Let me drive you home,” Alex suggested, his voice laden with worry.noveldrama
Sadie shook her head gently. “Thanks, Alex, but I need some time to myself right now.”
Alex watched her desolate figure walk away, feeling a mix of emotions. Sadie went back to her studio and stared blankly at the jewelry designs strewn across her desk.

.
###Chapter 352:
Now, without the Starlight Stone, she wondered, what next?
After spending some quiet time in the studio, Sadie returned to the Myrtlewood Estate.
As she pushed the door open, the familiar aroma of natural wood welcomed her back.
The estate was quiet and somber, only the dim light from crystal chandeliers filling the vast living room, intensifying the solitude.
Weary, she moved towards the sofa but stopped dead in her tracks.
There sat Noah, an ornate velvet box in his grasp.
In that moment, time seemed to freeze.
Flashes of Kyla’s triumphant smirk at the Cloud Summit Club and Noah’s dismissive departure flashed through Sadie’s mind.
Sadie’s mind was vivid and relentless, as if someone had pressed play on a film she had no power to stop.
“You…” Her voice barely made it past her lips, a fragile whisper lost between them.
Noah lifted his head slowly, his eyes locking onto hers with a chilling stillness, unreadable yet charged.
“Why?” It wasn’t just a question—it was raw disbelief laced with betrayal. She had fought for the Starlight Stone, and yet he had helped Kyla take it like that.
Noah said nothing. He only stared, an enigma wrapped in silence.
Sadie felt a tightness in her chest, so heavy it made breathing difficult. “So… you and Alex?” His voice was low, edged with something sharp—something dangerous. “Back together?”
gα?ησν?s?com, home to unforgettable stories
Sadie was stunned for a moment, then immediately understood what he meant.
“What does it matter to you?” She forced the words out, steeling herself, but the impact of his accusation still stung.
Noah moved—sudden, deliberate. In an instant, he was in front of her, his arms locking around her, pulling her into his world of contradictions.
“Sadie, look at me!” Noah’s voice was rough, raw with barely restrained frustration.
Sadie reluctantly lifted her gaze. A storm brewed in her eyes—defiance clashing with something more fragile.
“Why did you go to that auction?” Noah’s voice was sharp, edged with suspicion. “Why do you want the Starlight Stone so damn much?”
Sadie felt the burn behind her eyes, the weight of everything pressing down on her.
He knew. He knew she wanted that stone, yet he had let Kyla walk away with it. And now, he had the audacity to interrogate her?
“Let go of me!” she snapped, thrashing against his hold.
But Noah didn’t loosen his grip. If anything, he pulled her closer—closer than she could stand.noveldrama
Then, without warning, he kissed her.
Tears slipped down her cheeks, mixing with the taste of his breath, the salty bitterness of betrayal and longing tangling into something unbearable.
She shoved him—hard. Noah staggered back just enough for her to tear herself away. Without a word, she turned and ran, slamming the door behind her as if trying to shut him out completely. 
.

###Chapter 353:
For a long moment, Noah stood frozen, staring at the closed door, his pulse hammering.
Then, with a heavy exhale, he pulled out his phone and dialed.
“Samuel,” he said, his voice cold, unreadable. “Find out why Sadie wants the Starlight Stone.”
The call ended. Noah dragged a hand through his hair, exhaling sharply.
He didn’t know what frustrated him more—the way Sadie looked at Alex, or the way it made him feel. Restless. Possessive. It was like he’d lose something vital if she slipped through his fingers.
Then, his phone buzzed. Samuel was calling back.noveldrama
“Sir, I have the information. It’s for the Dewy Hibiscus, the jewelry series. Mrs. Wall needs the Starlight Stone to restore it.”
Noah’s jaw tensed. “Dewy Hibiscus?”
“Yes. It’s been damaged. From what I gathered, the Starlight Stone is the only thing that can fix it.”
Noah ended the call without another word. His mind was filled with images of Sadie—lost in her work, hands covered in paint and dust, her brows drawn in fierce concentration.
No wonder he hadn’t seen her around often these past few days.
The next morning, Sadie’s reflection in the mirror was proof of a sleepless night—swollen eyes, pale skin, a heaviness that clung to her like a shadow.
She sat at the dining table, moving her fork absently.
Across from her, Noah ate with effortless composure, as if the night before had never happened.
The tales you love are at g?lnσνs?c?m
His knife cut through his pancake with deliberate precision, each movement calm, controlled. Too controlled.
The silence between them thickened, suffocating. The rhythmic clink of his silverware against the plate felt deafening in the stillness. Sadie finally set down her utensils, pushing her plate away.
“I’m done.”
Her voice was quiet but firm.
Without another word, she rose from her chair and walked away, her steps echoing in the silence.
Noah exhaled slowly, watching her go, his fingers tightening around his fork.
Sadie went straight to her room and shut the door, pressing her back against it as she drew in a slow, unsteady breath. Lifting her chin, she straightened her shoulders and moved toward her closet.
Just then, her phone buzzed.
An unfamiliar number flashed across the screen.
Sadie hesitated, her thumb hovering over the answer button. Something about it made her pause. Then, with a deep breath, she picked up.
“Hello?”
“Miss Hudson?” The voice was deep, unfamiliar.
“Yes, who’s this?”
“I’m a jeweler. Word is, you’ve been searching for a rare stone—the Starlight Stone.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 354:
Sadie’s breath hitched. Her grip tightened around the phone. Could this be—
“Yes,” she said, forcing her voice to stay calm. “Do you have one?”
“I have a stone that fits the description of the Starlight Stone.”
Excitement surged through Sadie, nearly making her forget to breathe. “Really?” she asked, her heart hammering. “Can I see it?”
“Of course,” the voice replied smoothly. “Let’s set up a meeting.”
“Fantastic, thank you so much!” Sadie exclaimed.
Once the call ended, she wasted no time getting ready for the meeting. She meticulously chose her outfit, aiming to present herself well. Later that day, Sadie met the enigmatic jeweler at a quiet cafe.
Dressed in scholarly gold-rimmed glasses, the middle-aged jeweler had an academic demeanor.
From a sleek black briefcase, he produced a stone and presented it to her. She accepted the stone with care and scrutinized it thoroughly. Remarkably, the stone was clear, bathed in a soft blue light, and bore a resemblance to the Starlight Stone.
“How much are you selling this for?” Sadie inquired, her voice edged with anxiety.
With a reassuring smile, the jeweler responded, “Miss Hudson, your design skills are well-known, and I understand the importance of this stone to you. I have no interest in exploiting that. Just offer what feels right to you.”
Overwhelmed by his kindness, Sadie responded hesitantly, “How could I possibly accept such generosity?”
“Please, it’s a gesture of respect for your talents.”

Ultimately, Sadie acquired the stone for a surprisingly modest sum.
Sadie’s elation was evident as she left the cafe, clutching the stone that felt like a tangible piece of hope in her palm.
The jeweler watched her departure before dialing Noah’s number. “Mr. Wall, the task is accomplished.”
Noah’s response was neutral. “Very good.”
“The stone was instantly recognized by Miss Hudson,” the jeweler said. With a thoughtful look, Noah ended the call and stared out the window, his expression unreadable.
Back at her studio, Sadie carefully set the Starlight Stone on her workbench.
Lionel had been waiting there for some time.
With a quick adjustment of his glasses, his eyes sparkled with anticipation.
“Sadie, you really found it,” Lionel said, his voice filled with excitement. “Let’s begin, Mr. Morgan.”
They knew precision was crucial for the restoration of the Dewy Hibiscus. The studio air was charged with focused intensity.
“Begin by gently polishing the Starlight Stone’s edges with diamond dust, Sadie. Take great care to preserve its internal structure,” Lionel offered, guiding from the sidelines.noveldrama
Sadie inhaled deeply, her movements cautious as she applied the diamond dust to the stone. The faint sound of grinding filled the silent studio, amplifying the tension around her.
Sweat beaded on her brow, yet she remained steadfast, not allowing herself to relax even for a second. 
.

.
###Chapter 355:
Looking up with concern, Sadie addressed Lionel. “The Starlight Stone is considerably harder than the original material. My fear is that it might crack during the fusion.”
After a brief pause to consider, Lionel responded, “Incorporate nephrite powder into the adhesive. The nephrite powder’s flexibility might buffer the impact due to the differing hardness.”
Heeding his suggestion, Sadie carefully blended the nephrite powder with the adhesive, ensuring the mixture was just right.
Dipping a fine brush into the adhesive, she delicately attached the Starlight Stone fragments to the compromised sections of the Dewy Hibiscus.
Time moved slowly as Sadie and Lionel focused intensely on their delicate task.
“Mr. Morgan, the adhesive appears to be setting more slowly than anticipated.” Lionel considered the possible cause as he approached the thermostat. “The low room temperature might be delaying the setting process.”
He adjusted the temperature by several degrees and added, “We should give it more time.”
The wait always seemed to drag on.
With apprehension evident in their expressions, Sadie and Lionel monitored the adhesive’s progress, worried about potential complications.
Gradually, the adhesive hardened, ensuring the Starlight Stone fragments were securely attached to the Dewy Hibiscus.
“It’s done!” Lionel said, smacking his thigh with excitement.
A deep sigh of relief escaped Sadie as her previously tense nerves began to unwind.

Raising her hand, she rubbed her weary eyes, her gaze fixed on the flawlessly restored “Dewy Hibiscus” with a profound sense of achievement. “It’s truly a masterpiece!”
Holding the “Dewy Hibiscus” up to the light for a closer examination, Lionel scrutinized every detail.
Placing the “Dewy Hibiscus” back down, Lionel turned to Sadie, his expression filled with curiosity. “How were you able to come across the Starlight Stone, Sadie? It’s incredibly rare, almost never seen on the market.”
Sadie hesitated briefly. “I was contacted by a jeweler. He mentioned having a Starlight Stone and inquired if I wanted it.”
“Which jeweler was this?” asked Lionel.
“I’m, the place is called Luxe Jewelry,” Sadie answered, before recounting her purchase in detail.
Lionel’s face took on a grave expression as his brows knitted together.
“That’s a subsidiary of Wall Group, isn’t it?”
A cold wave swept over Sadie, her heart sinking.
The mention of Wall Group brought Noah to mind. Could this really be happening?
Sadie’s breathing quickened, her mind in chaos.
Lionel looked at Sadie’s reaction, his suspicions beginning to form. His tone was contemplative as he said, “You bought the Starlight Stone, an incredibly rare gem, at a suspiciously low price, from a jeweler tied to Wall Group. Doesn’t that seem a bit orchestrated to you, Sadie?”
As realization dawned, Sadie grew paler. Her lips quivered, but words failed her.

###Chapter 356:
Lionel’s words hit Sadie like a tidal wave.
The air around her felt thick, the buzzing in her ears drowning out everything else. She could hear the frantic pounding of her own heart—heavy, erratic, panicked.
Wall Group… Noah… a low price… coincidence…
The words tangled together, forming a truth too sharp to ignore. “This… this can’t be right…”
Her voice was barely more than a whisper, fragile and unsteady. The color drained from her face.
Why would Noah do this? He had helped Kyla win the Starlight Stone, only to sell it to her for next to nothing. Was this some twisted game? A way to humiliate her?
Or… was there something more to it?
Lionel exhaled, his voice softer now. “I know this is a lot to take in, but the facts speak for themselves. Whether you believe it or not, Mr. Wall isn’t as indifferent as you think.” His hand rested lightly on her shoulder, a small gesture of comfort.
Sadie forced herself to breathe, to push through the chaos in her mind. She straightened slightly, finding her voice. “Thank you for telling me this, Mr. Morgan. I’ll handle this myself.”
After Lionel left, Sadie remained in the studio, her gaze fixed on the restored “Dewy Hibiscus.” With deliberate care, she placed it into a sleek, velvet-lined box. Then, without hesitation, she grabbed her car keys and headed for Stonemont Estate.
The estate was as opulent as ever, with its towering gates and immaculate garden. Pulling into the driveway, Sadie took a steadying breath before stepping out. She rang the doorbell.
“Miss Hudson, welcome!” The butler greeted her with polished civility, opening the gates.

“Is Ms. Shaw home?”
“Yes, she’s expecting you in the garden.”
Sadie walked through the marble-clad corridors, her heels clicking against the polished floor. The grand interior led her to an open garden, where Eva sat like a vision of effortless elegance. A glass of red wine rested in her hand, her crimson gown draping around her like a waterfall of silk.
At the sight of her, Eva’s lips curved into a knowing smile. “Sadie, you made it.”
She set down her glass, her eyes flickering with interest. “So? Do you have it?”
Sadie gave a small nod, handing over the box. “Here.”
Eva’s fingers moved with precision, lifting the lid as if unveiling a masterpiece. For a moment, she simply stared. Then, admiration lit up her features. “It’s exquisite. The craftsmanship, the detail—every part of it is breathtaking.”
“I’m glad you think so.” Sadie forced a polite smile.
“What’s wrong?” Eva asked, tilting her head slightly. “You don’t look like someone who just completed a masterpiece.” Eva’s gaze sharpened as she studied Sadie.
Sadie hesitated. A part of her wanted to keep everything bottled up, to deal with it alone—but another part needed to say it out loud. She took a breath and told Eva everything. About Noah. About Kyla. About the Starlight Stone.
“Noah… he actually did that?” Eva leaned back slightly, brows drawn in genuine surprise.

###Chapter 357:
Sadie swallowed, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t know… I just—” She sighed sharply, shaking her head. “I can’t believe he would do this.”
Eva reached over, her touch light but steady as she placed a reassuring hand on Sadie’s. “Don’t jump to conclusions,” she murmured. “Maybe it’s not as bad as it looks. Maybe he has reasons he couldn’t tell you.”
“Reasons?” Sadie echoed, her voice laced with disbelief. “I don’t think so.” Her fingers curled into tight fists, nails pressing against her palms as she fought to keep the tremor in her body under control.
“He’d do anything for Kyla,” she muttered.
She couldn’t fathom why Noah was treating her this way. Did she truly mean so little to him?
Eva watched her in silence, reading the way she held herself—rigid, as if forcing the pain to stay buried.
This woman was stubborn, that much was clear. She was breaking, but she refused to let anyone see the cracks.
With an effortless grace, Eva lifted her wine glass, taking a slow sip.
“Sadie.” She set the glass down, the faintest hint of curiosity in her gaze. “Are you ready for the Starlight Gala tomorrow?”
Sadie stilled. The Starlight Gala. She had nearly forgotten.
Everything that had happened recently had consumed her, pushing the event to the very back of her mind.
Sadie opened her mouth, but the words didn’t come.
Even with the “Dewy Hibiscus” restored, the weight of the Starlight Stone still clung to her like a thorn, impossible to ignore. It festered beneath the surface, making it impossible to feel at ease.

Eva watched her carefully, amusement flickering in her gaze. Then, a knowing smile curved her lips.
“Sadie,” she said smoothly, her voice both gentle and firm. “I know this hurts. But you can’t let it break you.”
Sadie blinked, startled by Eva’s sudden intensity.
“You need to pull yourself together,” Eva continued, leaning forward slightly. “Show them what you’re made of.”
She met Sadie’s gaze head-on. “The Starlight Gala is your chance. Let the world see your talent. Let Noah see it too.”
Her words struck like a hammer, reverberating through Sadie’s mind.
Exactly! She couldn’t let this crush her! She had to stand tall no matter what!
“Thank you, Ms. Shaw,” Sadie said, her voice steadier now, the spark of determination returning.
Eva let out a soft chuckle, tilting her head. “Oh, darling, why thank me?” Her smile was effortless, laced with quiet confidence. “I believe in your talent. Of course, I want to see you succeed.”noveldrama
She paused, then added smoothly, “I’ve taken the liberty of arranging for a dress to be delivered to you tomorrow morning. Consider it a small gesture. Prepare well—I’ll be expecting you at the Starlight Gala tomorrow night.”
Sadie met her gaze and nodded, determination flickering in her eyes. “I’ll be there.”
Eva’s lips curled into a satisfied smirk. “That’s what I like to hear.” She leaned back in her chair, the glow of the evening lights casting soft shadows over her features. “It’s late. Go home and get some rest. You’ll need your strength for tomorrow.”

###Chapter 358:
Sadie straightened, offering a grateful nod. “Got it, Ms. Shaw. You should rest too.”
The butler led Sadie to the entrance, then gracefully held the car door open for her.
Sadie got into the car, started the engine, and drove slowly away from Stonemont Estate. The night had deepened, yet Myrtlewood Estate was brilliantly illuminated. Sadie pushed open the front door and rubbed her temples, weary. She halted abruptly, taken aback by the sight before her.
In the living room, Laura sat on the sofa, serenely peeling an apple. “Grandma? What are you doing here?” Sadie exclaimed, turning her gaze to Breck, who stood by respectfully. “What’s happening?”
Before Breck could respond, Laura offered a warm smile, her face creased with kindness. “Sadie, I was discharged from the hospital today. I met Noah, and he mentioned your concerns about me, so he brought me here to recuperate.” Laura handed the peeled apple to Sadie, her eyes probing. “Sadie, what exactly is your relationship with Noah?”
Taking the apple, Sadie felt as if she were holding a hot potato. She bit into the apple, but its sweetness did little to alleviate the bitterness swelling within her.noveldrama
“He’s… he’s just my boss,” Sadie stammered, avoiding Laura’s penetrating gaze.
“Boss?” Laura seemed skeptical, deftly tossing the apple core into the trash bin. “Why would your boss bring me back to his home? Why would he show such concern for you?”
Sadie struggled to articulate a response. She could not reveal to Laura that Noah had once been her husband, that he now seemed like a stranger, and that he even deliberately complicated her life.
“Sadie,” Laura continued earnestly, setting down the fruit knife. “I’m old, and my only wish is for you to find someone with whom you can build a joyful future. Noah appears kind. He’s dynamic, successful, and shows genuine care for you.”

“Grandma, it’s not as you think,” Sadie cut in, her voice tinged with urgency. “There really is nothing between us.”
“Then why is he so concerned for you?” Laura inquired, gesturing to the flowers and fruit on the table. “He had these delivered to nourish you.”
Sadie gazed at the vibrant flowers, her emotions a tangled web of confusion and frustration.
Indeed, Noah’s gestures had bred these misunderstandings.
“Grandma, you really misunderstood…” Sadie murmured, her voice fading to a whisper.
Laura sighed and patted Sadie’s hand. “Sadie, I know you have your reservations, but love cannot be coerced. If you truly don’t harbor feelings for him, I’ll refrain from pressuring you.”
Sadie fell silent, her gaze fixed on the apple in her hand as she pondered.
“Alright, I’ll say no more,” Laura declared with a smile, easing the tension. “You look exhausted. Go rest.”
Without responding, Sadie left the living room and retreated to her bedroom. She closed the door, leaned against it, and slid to the floor. Clutching her knees to her chest, she buried her face in them, tears streaming down silently.
She couldn’t fathom Noah’s motives. Why had he brought Laura here and shown such concern? Was he seeking retribution for her departure years ago?
Morning light seeped through the curtains, casting slender beams across the floor. Sleep had eluded Sadie; dark circles marred her eyes. The digital clock on her nightstand displayed 6:37 in a harsh glow.

###Chapter 359:
Noah hadn’t come home all night.
She rose slowly and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window. Aware that Laura was still in the guest room and not wanting to cause her concern, Sadie suppressed her own unease.
After freshening up, she descended the stairs and found breakfast prepared.
“Mr. Wall… didn’t come back last night?” Sadie asked Breck, her voice steady yet betraying a slight tremor.
Breck shook his head slightly. “No, Mrs. Wall.”
“Um, did he mention when he’d return?”
“He did not,” Breck replied, his demeanor respectful yet conveying an unspoken tension.
Sadie bit her lower lip, struggling to swallow the lump forming in her throat.
Sadie walked to the table, absentmindedly picking up a piece of toast. She took a bite, but it tasted like nothing—just another motion in a morning that felt hollow. From the staircase, Laura appeared, radiating energy, as if the weakness from her hospital stay had been nothing more than a passing shadow.
“Sadie,” she called out warmly. “Why didn’t you sleep a little longer?”
Sadie hesitated before forcing a small, tired smile. “Couldn’t get any.”
Laura slid into the seat beside her, studying her carefully. Then, she softened. “This is about Noah, isn’t it?”noveldrama
Sadie’s fingers clenched slightly around her silverware. She didn’t answer.
“Oh, sweetheart,” Laura said with a light chuckle. “Matters of the heart have a way of working themselves out. Don’t overthink what you can’t control.”
Sadie exhaled slowly, her chest rising and falling as she tried to absorb those words.
“I’m fine, Grandma,” she said softly.
Laura studied her for a moment, then sighed before turning to head back upstairs.
Sadie knew she meant well, but inside, she was a whirlwind of emotions—sweetness, bitterness, uncertainty—all tangled together.
Just then, Breck stepped forward, placing a beautifully wrapped gift box on the table with precise care.
“Mrs. Wall, this has just arrived from Ms. Shaw,” he announced.
Sadie blinked, her gaze landing on the package.
Already? She remembered Eva mentioning the dress for the Starlight Gala, but she hadn’t expected it to arrive so soon.
A warmth spread through her chest. Eva never did things halfway.
“Thank you,” Sadie murmured, nodding at Breck before reaching for the elegant ribbon. Her fingers worked delicately, untying the bow, anticipation stirring inside her.
As she lifted the lid, a breathtaking silver gown was revealed, shimmering under the morning light. Tiny diamonds adorned the fabric, catching every glimmer like captured stars.
Sadie ran her fingers over the smooth silk, the softness like liquid against her skin. She carefully lifted the dress, holding it against herself, unable to resist the pull of its beauty. A breath escaped her lips.
“It’s… stunning,” she whispered to herself.
With a maid’s assistance, Sadie slipped into the gown. The fabric molded to her frame like a second skin, accentuating every curve with effortless elegance. It was neither too tight nor too loose—just perfect.
She stepped in front of the full-length mirror, her breath catching as she took in her reflection.

###Chapter 360:noveldrama
“It… fits so perfectly,” she murmured, almost in disbelief.
The gown wasn’t just a good fit—it felt as if it had been crafted for her. The cut, the drape, the delicate way it hugged her form—it was flawless.
Behind her, Breck observed with quiet admiration.
“Ms. Shaw truly thinks of everything,” he remarked, clearly impressed.
Sadie nodded slowly, her fingers grazing the bejeweled fabric. But a thought nagged at the back of her mind. How had Eva known her exact measurements? They’d spoken briefly over a video call, and size had never been discussed.
Meanwhile, after Noah pulled an all-nighter at work, exhaustion clung to him like a shadow. Then came Kyla—breezing in like a force of nature, her arm sliding around his with practiced ease.
“Noah, come with me to pick out a dress,” she said, her voice sweet, almost syrupy. “We have to attend the Starlight Gala together tonight. Please? Help me out?”
Noah glanced down at her, fatigue dulling his usually sharp gaze. He wasn’t in the mood for this. But then, with a sigh, he relented.
“Alright,” he muttered, rubbing his temples. “Where do you want to go?”
Kyla’s face lit up instantly, a gleam of excitement flashing in her eyes.
“Celeste Couture!” she chirped, already tugging him toward the exit. “I’ve always wanted to try on their moonlight tulle gown!”
Celeste Couture was the definition of extravagance. Crystal chandeliers dangled from the ceiling, scattering a dazzling glow over the boutique’s pristine interior. Mannequins adorned in breathtaking gowns stood like silent models, each dress more exquisite than the last. Kyla flitted between racks like a butterfly, her energy boundless as she sifted.
Through layers of silk, lace, and tulle, Kyla sifted through the gowns. Every few moments, she plucked one from the collection, holding it up against herself with a twirl.
“Noah,” she called, spinning around with a strapless pink gown in hand. “What do you think of this one?” She posed dramatically, as if already picturing herself at the Starlight Gala, dazzling under the lights.

Noah’s gaze lingered on Kyla for a brief moment before he gave a small nod.
“It’s beautiful. It suits you.”
But Kyla pouted, twirling the fabric between her fingers.
“Mmm… but I still think the moonlight tulle gown would be even better!”
Before Noah could respond, a uniformed attendant approached, bowing slightly in his direction.
“Mr. Wall, the moonlight tulle gown you ordered has already been delivered to Myrtlewood Estate.”
Kyla’s smile vanished. She turned to Noah, eyes widening in disbelief.
“You… gave it away?”
A moment of silence passed before Noah realized his mistake. His fingers flexed at his side before he cleared his throat.
“That gown… it isn’t really suited for you.”
“Not suited for me?” Kyla repeated, her voice rising.
“Then why did you order it? And who did you give it to?”
Noah pressed his lips into a thin line, a flicker of irritation flashing through his deep-set eyes. He didn’t answer. He didn’t have to.
“Noah, have you forgotten…?” Kyla’s voice wavered, laced with a desperate attempt to pull Noah back—to remind him of what they once shared.
Noah exhaled sharply, his patience wearing thin.
“Kyla, don’t push this.”

###Chapter 361:
Kyla’s breath hitched as tears welled up, glistening under the boutique lights like shattered glass. She bit her lip, struggling to hold back a sob, her eyes pleading.
“I… I just want to understand why…”
“There is no why.” Noah cut in, his tone edged with finality. “Go home.” He turned to leave, but before he could take a step, Kyla lunged forward, wrapping her arms around him from behind, clinging to him as if letting go would tear her apart.
“Noah, don’t go… please don’t leave me like this…” Her voice broke, raw and desperate.
Noah stiffened. A flicker of something unreadable passed through his eyes, but it vanished just as quickly. His fingers curled into fists before he reached down to pry her hands off, his voice cold as ice.
“Kyla. Let go.”
Kyla only held on tighter, her grip unrelenting, her body trembling against his.
“I won’t let go… I can’t let go…”
“Kyla!” Noah’s voice turned sharp, a warning cutting through the air.
She flinched. The fight drained from her as she slowly loosened her grip, gazing at him with tearful eyes.
Her lips parted, her voice barely above a whisper.
“You really have… changed.”
Noah said nothing. He simply walked out.
The boutique’s extravagant glow suddenly felt hollow. Left standing in the middle of it all, Kyla remained frozen—alone, her world closing in on itself.
The Starlight Gala shimmered with extravagance—crystal chandeliers spilled golden light over a crowd draped in luxury. A velvet-red carpet stretched ahead, a celestial path leading straight into the realm of the elite.
Sadie stepped inside, her floor-length gown a masterpiece of sophistication. Every stitch and fold seemed sculpted to complement her silhouette, effortlessly displaying poise and confidence.
L€$? tя? ?η glov?l.оm
“Never thought I’d see Sadie here.”
“That gown must have cost a fortune.”
“I heard her latest designs are turning heads again. Maybe she’s reclaiming her throne.”
Murmurs drifted toward Sadie, heavy with curiosity and judgment. She barely acknowledged them, offering only a knowing smirk as she moved through the hall, each step as measured as a queen’s.
Cameras erupted in flashes, their relentless bursts carving her presence into the night.
Then, just as she settled into her seat, the air shifted. A subtle but unmistakable ripple of awe swept through the room.
Noah had arrived.noveldrama
True to form, Noah commanded the room the moment he stepped in. His custom-tailored suit draped flawlessly over his broad frame, every detail accentuating his quiet dominance. There was an effortless grace to the way he moved—calculated yet natural, a presence both magnetic and inescapable.
At his side, her arm delicately intertwined with his, stood Kyla.
Draped in a champagne-colored gown that shimmered under the lights, she was the picture of elegance, her poised demeanor complemented by a soft, practiced smile. Together, they looked almost surreal—a portrait of perfection, effortlessly composed.
“They’re breathtaking, like something out of a fairy tale. Mr. Wall and Miss Wade—what a flawless match.”
Admiration rippled through the crowd, their voices hushed yet brimming with envy and awe.

###Chapter 362:
Sadie lowered her gaze, her thick lashes casting faint shadows across her cheekbones, concealing whatever flicker of emotion might have surfaced. Three years ago, she had already seen this sight unfold time and time again.
Three years ago, she had already stopped longing for what could have been.
“Strange, though… why aren’t they married yet?”
“Who knows?” A sly chuckle followed. “Maybe Mr. Wall isn’t done enjoying the game.”
The speculative whispers slithered through the air, brushing against Sadie’s ears like unwelcome ghosts. Her grip tightened around her handbag, her knuckles blanching from the force.
She willed herself to shut it all out—not to look, not to listen.
Under the banquet hall’s shimmering lights, she sat alone at her table, her posture composed, but her mind an unsteady battlefield.
Then, without warning, someone slid into the seat beside her—a figure draped in champagne silk—Kyla. To Sadie, she was the woman Noah had chosen, the one who still stood by his side after all these years.
The faint scent of jasmine followed Kyla as she idly tapped her crimson-painted nails against the table, each click deliberate, calculated.
“Three years, Miss Hudson,” she murmured. “And yet, you’re still lingering like a shadow.”
Sadie met her gaze, her expression unshaken. “I could say the same, Miss Wade.”
For a fraction of a second, Kyla’s polished exterior cracked, her lips pressing into a thin line before she released a low, mirthless laugh.
“What exactly do you think you are?” she sneered. “A discarded woman shackled with a child? Do you honestly believe you stand a chance against me?”
A slow, knowing smile played on Sadie’s lips.
“What I am is irrelevant,” she said coolly. “What matters is that Noah has never once admitted you are his.”
The air between them turned electric, hostility simmering beneath their exchange.
Then, as if on cue, a banquet staff member approached their table, bowing slightly before addressing Kyla with crisp politeness.
“I apologize, Miss Wade, but this section is reserved for the top international designers. Your seat is further back.”
Kyla’s smile faltered, stiffening into something unnatural. She turned, pointing straight at Sadie.
“Her?” Kyla’s voice dripped with disbelief, her perfectly arched brows drawing together in disdain. “You’re telling me she’s a top international designer?”
The staff member gave a polite nod.
“Yes, Miss Wade. Sandra is one of our distinguished guests this evening.”
A flush of humiliation crept up Kyla’s neck, burning as though she had been struck.
She turned back to Sadie, her eyes blazing with jealousy.
“How on earth did you earn a seat here?”noveldrama
Sadie remained unfazed. With effortless elegance, she lifted a glass of champagne, her slender fingers tracing the delicate stem as she took an unhurried sip.
“It appears you’re out of the loop.” A pause, deliberate. “I am Sandra.”
Kyla froze, recalling that Jordyn had mentioned this to her months ago.
She still couldn’t accept that Sadie, the woman she had scorned for years, was the renowned jewelry designer, Sandra.
Her lips parted, but no words escaped.
Sadie set down her glass with quiet finality, her expression composed yet laced with an unmistakable edge. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 363:
“Is there anything else, Miss Wade?” she asked, her voice smooth as silk, yet sharp enough to cut. “If not, I’d prefer not to be disturbed.”
Kyla’s jaw clenched. The sting of defeat was unbearable, but she had no choice but to swallow it. With a sharp flick of her wrist, she stood up and strode away.
The murmurs surged almost instantly.
“So she’s Sandra? She’s even more striking in person.”
“Kyla just got completely humiliated. She won’t recover from this anytime soon.”
As the whispers spread like wildfire, a man with slicked-back hair and an amused smirk sauntered over, a glass of champagne twirling between his fingers.
“Hey, gorgeous. Sitting all alone?” The man got closer, flashing what he clearly believed was an irresistible smile. “Mind if I join you?”
Sadie barely spared him a glance, her polite demeanor unwavering.
“I’d rather not. Thank you.”
But he wasn’t one to take a hint.
“Waiting for someone?” he pressed, his tone laced with unwelcome persistence. “Maybe I can keep you company.”
As he spoke, his hand moved toward Sadie’s, fingers hovering just close enough to make her skin crawl.
Sadie’s expression darkened. In one swift motion, she withdrew her hand, her voice turning to ice.
“Sir, I suggest you conduct yourself properly.”
The man’s smirk faltered, his expression tightening with irritation. Just as he opened his mouth to fire back, a firm, steady voice cut through the tension.
“Sadie, sorry to keep you waiting.”

Alex stepped in with effortless confidence, positioning himself squarely between Sadie and the unwelcome intruder. His sharp, assessing gaze flickered over the man, silent yet commanding. Whatever bravado the man had left quickly withered under Alex’s piercing stare.
“What a bore,” he grumbled before turning on his heel and walking away into the crowd.
Alex exhaled lightly before turning to Sadie.
“Are you alright?”
Sadie nodded her head, her composure intact.
“I’m fine. Thank you.”
Alex’s gaze lingered on her.noveldrama
“These events always attract a few entitled idiots,” he remarked, his voice calm, though edged with quiet irritation.
The surrounding guests began whispering among themselves again.
“Who is that man? He seems quite familiar with Sandra.”
“Isn’t that Alex, the CEO of Howe Group? They look like they’re meant to be together.”
“A pair that match well in both talent and beauty!”
Noah overheard those whispers, and his expression immediately darkened. His grip tightened around his wine glass.
From a distance, he watched Sadie and Alex, a whirlwind of emotions in his eyes.
Sadie and Alex sat close, conversing in hushed tones.
“Thank you for your help earlier,” Sadie said, expressing her gratitude once again.
Alex responded with a faint smile, “It was nothing, really. How have you been? And how’s Averi?”
“We’re both doing well. Thanks for asking,” Sadie replied, her voice softening. 
.

.
###Chapter 364:
“That’s good to hear.” Alex looked at Sadie, his gaze filled with a subtle warmth that was barely noticeable.
However, this scene was like a dagger to Noah’s heart. He gulped down his wine in one go, feeling a surge of indescribable frustration.
At that moment, Eva approached, her presence marked by a graceful sway. She offered a captivating smile.
“Well, well… Isn’t this Mr. Wall? Why are you drinking alone?”
Noah ignored her, his attention still on Sadie.
Following his gaze, Eva noticed Sadie and Alex.
She raised an eyebrow and commented with a hint of meaning, “It seems you’re not with me, Mr. Wall.”
Noah shifted his gaze and gave Eva a cool look.
Eva laughed softly.
“Mr. Wall, don’t be so distant. I just wanted to remind you. Some opportunities, once lost, are lost forever.”
Noah remained silent, continuing to sip his wine as his expression turned even grimmer.
Eva laughed again and walked away to get ready for her show.
Kyla rejoined Noah, sitting down with elegance. She placed her hand on his arm, her eyes on Sadie with a barely detectable smirk.
She was convinced that Sadie wouldn’t be smiling soon.
The jewelry from Wall Group had already been delivered to Eva the previous day.
Tonight, Eva would wear it, ensuring Wall Group had the spotlight.
Stay updated with galnσν.c?m
Sadie’s creations risked being overshadowed entirely.
Aware of Kyla’s probing gaze, Sadie didn’t retreat.
Instead, she confronted it with a composed, subtle smile, her demeanor unflappable.
“Noah, look! Sandra appears completely unfazed,” Kyla commented.
Noah remained mute, offering only a fleeting, enigmatic glance in Sadie’s direction.
As the evening progressed, the banquet hall’s lights dimmed, shifting everyone’s focus to the center stage under a solitary spotlight.
“The moment has arrived to welcome tonight’s most esteemed guest, Ms. Eva Shaw!” the host announced, his voice filled with vigor.
As music swelled and lights danced across the room, all eyes diverted to the hall’s grand entrance.noveldrama
Kyla, brimming with premature triumph, clung to Noah’s arm, anticipating Sadie’s disgrace.
However, Sadie’s smile persisted, barely wavering even as her grip on her wine glass tightened.
A buzz of astonishment swept through the attendees when Eva made her entrance. Clad in a stunning red gown that accentuated her complexion, Eva captivated everyone.
Yet, there was a fluffy white Samoyed by her side, sporting a gaudy diamond necklace from Kyla’s team.
Kyla’s confident smile stilled, her features etched with disbelief.
“What the…” she gasped, stunned. “How could this have happened?”
The spectacle was far from over.
Eva gracefully ascended the stage, her presence commanding attention. The necklace she wore sparkled under the lights, its diamonds like droplets of water, encapsulating a delicate, lively charm.

###Chapter 365:
“Dewy Hibiscus is simply breathtaking!” exclaimed a notable socialite. “Truly, its design marvelously merges diamond brilliance with the essence of femininity,” remarked a gentleman from the crowd.
Color drained from Kyla’s face as she absorbed the reality—the necklace was Sadie’s work.
She whipped her head towards Sadie, only to find her still sporting that serene, knowing smile, as if she had orchestrated the evening’s events.
“Ms. Shaw, your necklace is absolutely stunning!” a reporter called out eagerly. “Could you reveal the mastermind behind its design?”
With a subtle smile, Eva turned her attention to Sadie.
“The creator of the Dewy Hibiscus is none other than Sandra,” she announced, directing all acclaim her way.
As the applause thundered throughout the hall, all eyes turned to Sadie, celebrating her design.
Kyla’s cheeks burned with embarrassment. She felt utterly humiliated by the turn of events.
All her meticulous preparations had turned into a joke.
She bit her bottom lip so fiercely it nearly drew blood, her fingernails pressed into her palms.
“Ms. Shaw, the Dewy Hibiscus necklace you’re wearing is simply stunning,” a well-dressed gentleman commented as he approached Eva. “May I ask how you chose this jewelry set?”
Eva ran her fingers over the necklace, her eyes alight with appreciation.
“The Dewy Hibiscus isn’t just beautifully designed. It also incorporates elements from Helva’s traditional art. Sandra’s sketches brought a wonderful surprise to the set.”
“And this adorable Samoyed accompanying you…” The gentleman’s attention shifted to the dog, adorned with a necklace by Kyla.
Your next chapter awaits at galnσcom
Eva feigned surprise, raising her eyebrows.
“This little one? It’s dressed up especially for tonight.”
“I meant its necklace…” The gentleman faltered, his query fading into awkwardness.
“This piece?” Eva laughed, stroking the Samoyed’s head. “It’s from a young designer. Although the design might be somewhat elaborate, the quality of materials is superb. It suits my furry friend perfectly here.”
Eva’s offhand comments seemed to make the floor beneath Kyla disappear. She felt the weight of scornful, pitying, and even gleeful glances from around the room.
Noah’s face grew stern.
“Noah…” Kyla whispered, tugging at his sleeve, her voice quivering with emotion.
Noah, however, ignored her.
Just then, a sharp voice pierced the air, tinged with sarcasm.
“Ms. Shaw, don’t you find this somewhat disrespectful?”
All eyes turned toward the source, spotting a woman clad in a sleek black gown striding elegantly toward them.
Her features exuded confidence, and the crowd recognized her as Vivi, the chief designer at Majestic Ego.
Vivi’s presence added to the already electric atmosphere.
Eva responded with a dismissive look, her voice dripping with condescension.noveldrama
“This belongs to me. How I use it is my concern alone. Miss Quinn, perhaps you should keep your opinions to yourself and focus on your own matters.”
Vivi was caught off guard by Eva’s forthrightness, her expression hardening.
She inhaled deeply, attempting to keep her composure intact.

###Chapter 366:
“Ms. Shaw, I didn’t mean to offend. I just find it somewhat demeaning to use Miss Wade’s design on a dog.”
“What’s wrong with adorning a dog?” Eva cut her off. “It’s my pet, and I’ll accessorize it as I see fit. Maybe, Miss Quinn, you should pay more attention to enhancing your own designs rather than critiquing my choices.”
Eva’s authoritative tone rendered Vivi momentarily speechless.
Vivi bit her lip, her eyes flickering toward Sadie, revealing a whirlwind of emotions.noveldrama
Sadie, who had been watching the exchange silently, allowed a subtle smile to play at the corners of her mouth.
When Vivi approached and took the seat next to her, her voice carried a sharp edge.
“It’s been a while, Sandra.”
Sadie turned her head, meeting Vivi’s gaze with a steady one of her own.
“Indeed, it has.”
The air crackled with tension as their eyes locked.
“I didn’t expect to find you here,” Vivi remarked, her tone laced with envy.
Sadie’s smile was faint yet confident.
“I was invited.”
“Humph!” Vivi scoffed, her voice bitter. “It seems you’ve been prospering since your return to Helva.”
“I appreciate the compliment,” Sadie responded, her posture composed and resolute.
Vivi observed Sadie’s serene poise, feeling her resentment grow.
“Sandra, don’t assume a single victory gives you the upper hand. We’ll see how long that lasts.”
Ga ln ovels . com fuels your imagination
Sadie raised an eyebrow, her tone even.
“I’m always prepared.”
While she maintained her composure outwardly, Sadie felt a sense of inner tension.
The banquet transitioned to a buffet-style dinner, under the gleam of chandeliers.
Elegant guests mingled, glasses clinked, and the rich aroma of gourmet dishes filled the air. Yet, beneath the surface, a subtle tension simmered, fueled by unseen rivalries.
Navigating the crowd with a champagne flute, Vivi engaged various designers with a charming smile, subtly disparaging Sadie’s work.
“Sadie’s designs, well, they’re rather avant-garde, not really aligned with mainstream preferences,” she commented with a feigned sigh of regret, her smugness thinly veiled.
“Indeed, an excessive focus on artistic flair often compromises practicality,” one designer concurred, his eyes flashing with envy.
Another added in a hushed tone, “I heard rumors of plagiarism in her latest drafts, but who knows the truth?”
From a distance, Sadie watched the scene unfold, recognizing Vivi’s familiar tactics of isolation and character assassination.
“Sadie, why are you standing here by yourself?” Alex approached, plate in hand, his concern palpable.
Sadie replied, managing a smile, “I just need a moment to breathe.”
Following her gaze, Alex quickly grasped the situation.
He leaned closer and whispered, “Ignore them. They’re just spreading gossip.”
Sadie simply shook her head, choosing silence over engagement.
Meanwhile, a man in a sharp suit approached Vivi, presenting her with a business card.
“Miss Quinn, hello. I’m an editor from Modern Muse magazine. I’ve long admired your work and would love to discuss a potential collaboration.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 367:
With a glowing smile, Vivi took the card.
“That sounds wonderful.”
She then shot a provocative look towards Sadie, as if to highlight her own success.
Struggling to stay composed, Sadie felt the weight of the evening’s events. The banquet continued, though undercurrents of tension simmered beneath the surface.
“Sandra, it’s been a while,” a sleazy voice whispered in Sadie’s ear.
Sadie turned to find a middle-aged man leering at her.
“I’m sorry, but I don’t recall knowing you,” she responded coldly.
“Oh, come on, don’t be so cold. I’m the owner of Westvale Group, and I’m very interested in your designs,” the man said, reaching out to touch her hand. Sadie swiftly pulled away, her expression darkening.
“Please, keep your hands to yourself.”
The man scoffed.
“Oh? A bit temperamental, aren’t we? Do you know who I am? Cross me, and your career is over.”
“Is that so?” a calm voice interjected.
Noah had quietly approached, his icy stare chilling the man.
“Mr. Wall…” The man’s face drained of color.
“Leave,” Noah stated flatly.noveldrama
The man scurried away in a panic.
Noah turned to Sadie, his tone softening.
“Are you alright?”
Explore more fiction on gα?ησν?s?
Sadie nodded, then thanked him.
“Yes, thank you.”
Noah’s gaze then turned towards Vivi, who was observing from a short distance, his expression inscrutable.
As the banquet wound down and guests started leaving, Vivi sidled up to Sadie, a cold smirk on her face.
“Sandra, we’ll see who comes out on top.”
Sadie faced her without flinching.
“Anytime.”
As the banquet hall emptied, Sadie declined Alex’s offer for a ride and stood alone by the hotel entrance.
Her phone buzzed with several unread messages—offers from prestigious jewelry brands eager to collaborate.
The successful debut of her “Dewy Hibiscus” collection had opened up unprecedented opportunities.
The following day, Sadie was immersed in back-to-back business meetings.
“Miss Hudson, we find your design philosophy quite exceptional,” a representative from Lusso Jewelry, a sophisticated Montrevian woman, complimented. “However, we would like some adjustments to the ‘Dewy Hibiscus’ collection to better fit our market and appeal to mainstream preferences.”
Sadie’s brow furrowed.
“Adjustments? Could you specify what changes you’re considering?”
“For example, you could simplify some of the complex details and add more commercial elements,” the Montrevian woman replied with a smile. “There has to be balance between art and commerce, wouldn’t you agree?”
Sadie’s fingers tightened on the draft. Further revision of the design meant compromising her original artistic vision. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 368:
“I shall take your suggestion into serious consideration,” Sadie said politely.
After leaving Lusso Jewelry, she hurried off to her next appointment with a famous local brand called Starluxe.
“Miss Hudson, we are very interested in the Dewy Hibiscus series,” Conroy Beckett, the representative of Starluxe, said. He was a shrewd, middle-aged man who didn’t beat around the bush. “We are willing to buy out the rights for the derivative design for five million.”
Five million?
Sadie would have been amused, if not for the bitterness that rose in her chest. This price was far below her expectations.
“I beg your pardon, Mr. Beckett,” she said calmly. “But you might be severely underestimating the market value of Dewy Hibiscus. Its potential far exceeds five million.”
Conroy chuckled condescendingly. “Miss Hudson, you are a very talented designer. However, I don’t think you understand just how cutthroat this business is. Five million is the highest we can offer.”
Sadie got to her feet without saying another word.
“Miss Hudson, please wait,” Conroy called after her as she walked to the door. “We are open to negotiations. Let’s talk about this more.”
Sadie paused, but did not turn around.
“Six million is our absolute limit,” Conroy continued firmly.
Sadie took a deep breath. “I see. There’s no need for us to discuss anything, Mr. Beckett. Good day.”
Sadie spent the next few days meeting with several other jewelry brands, but her efforts were all futile.
Some brands tried to impose stringent conditions on the terms of the prospective collaboration, either restricting her creative freedom or lowering her compensation.

Others had obvious internal power conflicts that posed numerous uncertainties to the collaboration itself, let alone the performance of Dewy Hibiscus in the market.
Although she was exhausted, both physically and mentally, Sadie had no choice but to forge ahead.
She pushed through the front door of Myrtlewood Estate and was immediately greeted by the familiar scent of sandalwood. Some of her stress immediately fell away.
“You’re back, Mrs. Wall,” Breck greeted her respectfully as he took her purse and the stack of documents she had been holding.
Sadie could only hum in reply, changing into slippers and kneading her throbbing temples.
“Averi is already asleep,” Breck said quietly as he took in the weary look on her face.
Sadie nodded and headed toward the living room.
“Mr. Wall is in the study,” Breck added, as though he had read her mind.noveldrama
Sadie hesitated for a brief moment before changing directions and heading to the study instead.
She needed to talk to Noah.
Sadie knocked softly on the door.
“Come in,” Noah called out in his deep voice.
Sadie entered the study to find him behind a large desk, engrossed in a pile of paperwork.
He glanced at her, his expression calm and unreadable.
“Do you need something?”
Sadie took a deep breath before walking closer.
“Thank you.”

###Chapter 369:
Noah leaned back in his seat and raised an eyebrow at her.
“What for?”
“For helping me back at the Starlight Gala,” Sadie spoke softly, as if she was afraid raising her voice might break something rare and fragile.
That day, shortly after Noah had dealt with that troublesome man from the Westvale Group, he was called away to attend to other business.
Both of them had been so busy in the past few days that she hadn’t had the chance to thank him until tonight.
“And… for the Starlight Stone,” Sadie added, her voice barely above a whisper now. “I also wanted to thank you for that.”
The Starlight Stone was crucial to the restoration of Dewy Hibiscus. Without Noah’s intervention, Dewy Hibiscus might have been tarnished beyond repair.
A flicker of emotion crossed Noah’s eyes, but it was gone in the next second.
“That stone was yours to begin with.”
After saying that, he lowered his head and got back to the documents, not wanting to dwell on the subject.
The study fell silent, apart from the sound of pages turning. Soon, the air grew tense and heavy.
Sadie clutched a fistful of her dress, her grip so tight that the tips of her fingers turned white.
For a long while, she just stood there. Then, she finally said, “I’ll get going then.” Her voice was so soft it was almost inaudible.
Sadie turned and walked to the door, the sound of her heels tapping against the wooden floor painfully loud against the silence of the room.
It wasn’t until the sound of her fading footsteps was finally gone that Noah put the papers down and ran a palm over his face. He stared at the closed door and whispered a sigh.
Then he picked up his phone and dialed a number.
“Samuel, I need you to handle something for me.”
“Please go ahead, Mr. Wall,” a steady voice replied on the other end.
“Clear up all the rumors online about Sadie as well as… the rumors about her alleged affair with Alex. I want them all gone by tomorrow.”
“Mr. Wall,” Samuel began, sounding a little apprehensive. “Regarding Mr. Howe…”
“Don’t worry about him,” Noah interrupted in a tone that brooked no argument. “And remember, I want this to be cleaned up thoroughly. No traces left behind.”
“Understood,” Samuel replied succinctly.
Noah ended the call, tossed the phone on his desk, and leaned back in his chair with his eyes closed.
Meanwhile, Kyla hurled a wine glass at the fireplace, sending the crimson liquid splattering in all directions.
“That damn Eva! She put our design on a dog! She was mocking me!”
The director of the design department stood at a cautious distance, not daring to make a single sound.noveldrama
“Those imbeciles! They’re all useless!” Kyla’s voice was shrill and biting, and the director had to wince. Kyla then pointed to the door and ordered, “Bring me the designer of the necklace on the Samoyed! Now!”
The director of the design department wasted no time and hurried out to relay the urgent message.
Soon after, a young designer entered, shaking and noticeably terrified, his complexion ashen and lips trembling.
“Miss Wade—” His greeting was cut short by a sharp slap.

###Chapter 370:
Kyla’s fury was evident as she gestured towards the photo fragments scattered on the floor.
“Is this what you call a ‘masterpiece’? It’s being ridiculed everywhere! How could you show your face here?”
Holding his cheek, the designer broke down, tears flooding his face.
“Miss Wade…”
“Enough! You are fired! Leave my company at once!” Kyla commanded coldly, dismissing him without a trace of sympathy.
Reeling from the dismissal, the designer stumbled and hurried out of the room.
Kyla’s anger only grew.
“Eva! This isn’t over! You will pay for this!”
The design department director remained silent, cautiously observing.
Kyla halted suddenly, as if struck by a sudden thought.
“Vivi…” she whispered, her gaze sharpening. “She and Sadie aren’t exactly friends, either.”
A scheme began to crystallize in her mind.
She instructed, “Get in touch with Vivi. Tell her I’d like to meet her for lunch tomorrow to talk.”
The director nodded earnestly and went off to arrange the meeting.
Kyla gazed out at the evening sky, her lips twisting into a sinister smile.
“Sadie, just you wait. The real game is about to begin.”
Meanwhile, Vivi was engrossed in her work at her studio.
The recent Starlight Gala had left her frustrated. Eva’s unexpected defense of Sadie at the event had made Vivi feel humiliated.noveldrama
g?lnσνs?c?m, your destination for tales
“Damn Eva! Damn Sadie!” she exclaimed, crumpling a design draft and throwing it into the bin.
Just then, her assistant entered the room.
“Miss Quinn, Miss Wade has extended an invitation for lunch.”
Vivi paused, surprised, then smirked.
“Kyla wants to see me? Interesting indeed.”
After a moment’s consideration, Vivi decided to accept the offer. She instructed, “Please tell her I’ll accept her invitation.” The assistant acknowledged with a nod and departed.
Vivi looked out the window, her expression a mix of contemplation and intrigue as she whispered, “Sadie, Kyla… This will certainly be something to see.”
The following day, in the secluded elegance of a restaurant’s private room, Kyla and Vivi faced each other.
“Miss Quinn, so much has been said about you,” Kyla commented, toasting with a fake smile.
“You’re very generous with your words, Miss Wade,” Vivi responded, her glass echoing Kyla’s, her eyes alight with keen interest.
Their glasses met with a soft chime before they each indulged in a sip of the rich red wine.
“Miss Quinn, I presume you’re clear on why we’ve come together today,” Kyla said with clear intent.
“Please, enlighten me,” Vivi answered, her tone steady and composed.
“Sadie, as it turns out, poses a problem for both of us,” Kyla replied, her voice devoid of warmth.
Setting her glass aside, Vivi absently adjusted her ring, her eyes seeming to search the distance for answers. She gave a theatrical sigh, affecting a tone of reluctant acceptance.

###Chapter 371:
“It’s a delicate situation, Miss Wade,” she said, her forehead creasing slightly as if she was grappling with an ethical dilemma. “Given that Sadie and I were once colleagues and still meet often, it wouldn’t be right for me to just turn on her.”
Without a word, Kyla watched the nuances of Vivi’s expressions, understanding that this was not a dismissal but rather an opening to bargain.
With a sardonic laugh, Kyla responded, “Miss Quinn, our meeting today is rooted in our shared goal, correct? Sadie stands in the way of both our ambitions. Isn’t it time we cleared our paths?”
Vivi stopped twirling her ring and locked eyes with Kyla, her look intense.
“What are you implying, Miss Wade? I am not without principles, and I’ll need a justifiable cause to proceed.”noveldrama
“Justifiable cause?” Kyla echoed, her voice as cold as a razor’s edge. She let out a humorless chuckle, as if someone had just told the most absurd joke.
Then, fixing her gaze on Vivi, she said, “Have you already forgotten what happened at the Starlight Gala? Eva—oh, that meddling busybody—shamed me in front of everyone, all to defend Sadie. I’ve been stewing over that ever since. And Sadie…” Kyla scoffed. “She acts like she’s the world’s prodigy, forever upstaging you and sabotaging your career. Is that something you’re willing to put up with?”
A flicker of anger crossed Vivi’s face.
Her expression hardened, and for a moment, she said nothing at all.
“I’m open to working together, Miss Wade,” Vivi said at last, her voice steady, her gaze sharp and unwavering. “But I need proof of your sincerity.”
Kyla lifted her wine glass with practiced grace, taking a slow sip. The deep red liquid left a seductive stain on her lips as she set the glass down, her fingers trailing over the stem. A flicker of something dangerous—amusement, perhaps—danced in her eyes.
“And what, exactly, would sincerity look like to you?” she asked, her tone velvety smooth.
“I’m not interested in pretty words,” Vivi said bluntly. “I need something real. Something that proves you’re serious.”
New chapters now on .c?m
Kyla arched a perfectly shaped brow, intrigue sparking in her expression. “Oh? And what might that be?”
“The Wall family’s resources.” Vivi didn’t hesitate. She leaned forward slightly, her intent crystal clear. “I intend to win the International Jewelry Design Competition. For that, I need funding, influence, and the right connections. The Wall family has all of that—and more.”
Kyla chuckled, a rich, knowing sound, as if Vivi had just revealed a particularly entertaining secret.
“Ambitious, aren’t you, Miss Quinn?” She tilted her head, regarding Vivi like a predator sizing up its prey. “But tell me… why should I believe you’re capable of bringing Sadie down?”
Vivi’s lips curled into a slow, confident smile. “Sadie’s designs may be distinct, but flawless? Hardly.” Vivi’s voice dripped with contempt. “I’ll have whispers of plagiarism circulating before she even realizes what’s happening. Other designers will turn against her, brands will distance themselves, and her credibility will crumble.”
She paused, letting the venom settle in the air.
“I won’t just tarnish her reputation—I’ll erase her from the industry entirely.”
A flicker of approval lit up Kyla’s eyes. She leaned back, a satisfied smile playing on her lips.
“Good. I like your audacity,” she said, as if sealing an unspoken pact. “I’ll give you what you want. Once I marry Noah, the Wall family’s resources are yours to command.”
Vivi arched a skeptical brow.
“Marry Noah?” Her tone was laced with doubt. “Miss Wade, do you really think you can pull that off?” 
.

.
###Chapter 372:
“Of course!” Kyla smirked, the picture of unwavering confidence. “Noah has always wanted me. Sadie is nothing more than a temporary distraction. The moment she’s out of the picture, he’ll come back to where he belongs.”
Vivi didn’t question her further.
Whether Kyla succeeded or not was of little concern. What mattered was securing her own victory.noveldrama
“In that case, we have a deal.” Vivi lifted her glass, her expression unwavering. “Here’s to a successful partnership.”
Kyla met her gaze, raising her own glass in turn. The crystal clinked between them, the sound crisp, almost celebratory.
“To a successful partnership!” Kyla echoed, a triumphant glint in her eyes.
With the pact sealed, the two women wasted no time in plotting, dissecting every angle of their scheme. They mapped out each move with surgical precision—from how the rumors would be planted to the designers they would enlist in their quiet campaign to dismantle Sadie.
“I’ll start by dropping subtle hints, just enough to stir curiosity and gauge others’ reaction,” Vivi said, tapping her manicured fingers against the rim of her glass. “Once the whispers gain traction, I’ll reach out to designers who’ve had grievances with Sadie—stoke the fire, push them toward a boycott.”
Kyla nodded in approval.
“Smart. We’ll move forward with that.” She swirled her wine, watching the deep red liquid coat the sides of the glass. “I’ll have my people monitor the online chatter. The moment the tide shifts in our favor, we strike the next blow.”
Vivi’s lips curled in satisfaction.
To them, Sadie was nothing more than an obstacle—a name that would soon be erased from the industry’s memory.
gα?ησν?s?com, your source for inspiration
Kyla sat by the floor-to-ceiling window, her silhouette bathed in the light. She took a slow sip of wine, her smile smug, confident. Everything was unfolding exactly as she had envisioned.
It was only a matter of time before Sadie was reduced to nothing but a cautionary tale.
A few days later, Kyla sat on the edge of her seat, her manicured fingers tapping impatiently against her phone screen as she refreshed the news feed. Any moment now, she expected to see scathing headlines about Sadie, the rumors she and Vivi had so carefully planted taking root and spreading like wildfire.
But the screen remained stubbornly quiet. Her brow furrowed as she scrolled—nothing. No whispers of scandal, not even a hint of controversy. It was as if the rumors had evaporated into thin air, leaving no trace behind.
Her stomach twisted with unease.
This wasn’t how it was supposed to go.
By now, Sadie should have been drowning in condemnation, her career teetering on the edge of ruin.
The sharp click of heels against the floor yanked her from her thoughts. Her assistant burst into the room, flustered and breathless.
“Miss Wade, something’s wrong!”
Kyla turned, irritation flashing across her face.
“Why are you panicking? Compose yourself.”
The assistant swallowed hard.
“It’s… it’s about Miss Hudson. The negative posts—they’re gone! Wiped clean from the internet! And now… now people are praising her.” The assistant’s voice wavered. “She’s being hailed as a visionary designer, a woman of impeccable talent and integrity. Industry leaders are rallying around her!” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 373:
Kyla’s blood turned to ice.
“What did you just say?” she demanded, her voice razor-sharp.
The assistant held out a tablet, hands trembling. Kyla snatched it and scanned the screen furiously.
Sure enough, the smear campaign had vanished—every carefully placed whisper, every planted seed of doubt—gone.
In their place were glowing endorsements for Sadie, professionals in the field voicing their unwavering support, calling her brilliant and inspirational.
“What the hell is going on?” she roared, the force of her rage rattling the air.
The assistant flinched.
“I—I don’t know for certain, but… it looks like Mr. Wall’s team is behind this.”
“Noah?” Kyla hissed, her expression twisting with fury. “He actually helped her?” Her fingers curled around the tablet in a white-knuckled grip before she flung it to the floor. The screen shattered on impact, the sharp crack slicing through the tense silence.
“I can’t believe he’s choosing Sadie over me!” Kyla shouted in disbelief. Silently, the assistant bowed his head, too fearful to make any comment.
Kyla worked to soothe her own nerves.
Meanwhile, within the CEO office of Wall Group, Noah was sitting at his desk, absorbed in a document, with a concerned look knitting his brow.
“Samuel, give me an update,” he said.
Samuel stood before him, beginning, “Mr. Wall, we’ve effectively removed negative reports about Miss Hudson from the web. Public perception has turned favorable.”
Noah’s eyes flickered with a trace of satisfaction as he responded, “Good.”
Samuel hesitated slightly, then continued, “There’s another issue… It appears the root of these rumors may be connected to Miss Wade.”
Your adventure awaits at gα?ησν?s?c〇m
Noah’s head snapped up.
“What did you say?”
“Numerous accounts behind the rumors trace back to the assistant of Miss Wade.”
A shadow fell over Noah’s face.
“Kyla…”
His tone was deep, with a dark edge.
Setting aside the document he was reviewing, he clasped his hands together and fixed his gaze on the investigation results on his computer screen.
“According to our findings, Miss Wade’s assistant was involved, but it’s likely that Miss Wade was the mastermind,” Samuel said, his forehead beading with sweat.
Noah remained quiet, the room heavy with silence, as the air thickened with tension.noveldrama
“Very well,” Noah eventually said. “Have Kyla oversee the project in Slimron.”
Samuel blinked in surprise.
“Slimron?” Although the project was important, its location was notoriously challenging and isolated. This looked like a punishment.
“Mr. Wall, about the project in Slimron…” Samuel began.
Noah’s gaze snapped to him sharply.
“What? Is there something wrong with my decision?”
“Absolutely not.” Samuel quickly bowed his head. “I will handle it immediately.” He refrained from further comment and exited the office promptly.
Noah’s decision was final, and any effort to change his mind seemed pointless. Back at Kyla’s luxurious home, the tension was clear.
“How can he treat me like this for her sake!” Kyla seethed, her usually impeccable makeup doing little to conceal her rage. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 374:
Her assistant stood silently, terrified to utter a word or even breathe too loudly, in case he became the target of her wrath.
“Prepare the car! I need to see him!” Kyla commanded sharply, snatching her purse and heading for the door.
She was determined to confront Noah and demand answers for his decisions. Upon arrival at the Wall Group headquarters, Kyla wasted no time and headed directly for the CEO’s office.
“Miss Wade, entry is not permitted at this time!” A secretary guarded the office door resolutely.
“Step aside!” Kyla shouted, pushing the secretary as she tried to get past.
Surprised by Kyla’s forceful attempt, the secretary quickly barred her way again.
“Miss Wade, Mr. Wall is in a meeting. You cannot interrupt him now!”
“In a meeting?” Kyla applied more force to her push. “I need to see Noah immediately!”
“Please, Miss Wade, calm down…” The secretary, repeatedly pushed aside, showed a mix of anxiety and helplessness on her face.
Just then, Samuel stepped out from the office, noticing the commotion and frowning slightly.noveldrama
“What seems to be the problem?” he asked, his voice deep and commanding.
Grateful for the intervention, the secretary hurriedly explained to Samuel, “Miss Wade is demanding to see Mr. Wall, but he’s currently in an important meeting.”
“I need Noah to come out here now!” Kyla demanded, gesturing emphatically towards the office door.
Samuel responded, “Miss Wade, it’s impossible to see Mr. Wall at this time.”
“Impossible?” Kyla scoffed. “So he dismisses me for Sadie, and now he won’t even meet me?”
g ? lnσ ν ?s?com, your storytelling home
Kyla’s voice grew louder and more agitated, drawing the attention of the employees nearby.
“Please mind your words, Miss Wade,” Samuel said, his expression darkening.
“Mr. Wall asked me to relay a message to you.”
Kyla’s head jerked up, and her eyes lit up with hope.
“He did? What did he say?”
Samuel took a deep breath and spoke slowly.
“Mr. Wall said that he hoped you would have the good sense to know where you stand.”
The words struck Kyla like a bolt of lightning from the sky. All the color drained from her face, and all her strength seemed to have left her body too, as she swayed slightly from side to side.
“Where I stand?” Was that his way of reminding her that he had chosen Sadie? No! She refused to accept it!
“Impossible!” she cried. “He can’t treat me like this! After all these years, how can he just cast me aside like this?”
She made another attempt to rush into the office, but Samuel blocked her path.
“Miss Wade, please don’t make this any more difficult for the both of us.”
Kyla finally crumpled to the floor. Tears streamed down her face, ruining her previously flawless makeup. She looked utterly defeated.
The employees loitering around began to whisper among themselves as they stared and pointed at her. Their reactions varied from curiosity to pity. Samuel himself wasn’t sure what to feel upon seeing Kyla in such a state.
“Let me have the secretary take you home, Miss Wade,” he offered.
Instead of responding, Kyla hugged her knees and curled into a trembling mess in the middle of the hallway. The murmurs around her grew louder. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 375:
“Look at Miss Wade, she’s crying so hard.”
“Yeah, she used to have it all, you know. But now…”
“I heard that she and Mr. Wall were childhood sweethearts. They grew up together. Who would have thought—”
“Shh! Keep it down! Don’t let anyone else hear what you’re about to say.” Their comments cut deep, humiliating Kyla further.
Tina lurked among the crowd, and she had seen everything unfold before her eyes. Needless to say, she was astonished by this turn of events.
Her colleagues had told her that Kyla was Noah’s fiancée, and that they were to be married soon. But it was clear from Kyla’s outburst that that wasn’t the case at all.
Samuel turned to the secretary and gestured for her to help Kyla up.
“Please, Miss Wade,” the secretary said cautiously.
Kyla still said nothing, but she allowed herself to be taken away from the top floor.
As soon as she disappeared into the elevator, the busybodies gradually dispersed and returned to their desks.
This included Tina, who immediately grabbed her phone and called Sadie.
“Hey, Sadie! Guess what just happened?” She sounded all too eager to share some fresh gossip.
“What happened?” Sadie said in a weary voice.
“We just saw Kyla bawling her eyes out in front of Mr. Wall’s office. He didn’t even open the door! A secretary had to take her away.” Tina could barely contain her excitement as she recounted the event. There was a moment of silence on the other end of the line.
“What?” Sadie asked in obvious disbelief.
“She was crying so hard, her foundation turned into mud, and her mascara was running down her cheeks. Oh, oh! And everyone was watching, too! Apparently, Mr. Wall refused to see her and instructed Samuel to tell her to know where she stands.”
g?lnσνs?c?m brings endless adventures
“Know where she stands?” Sadie repeated with growing unease.
“Yes! Then my colleagues started talking about how they always thought Kyla was Mr. Wall’s fiancée. But now…” Tina lowered her voice before continuing, “It looks like Mr. Wall never saw her that way.”
Sadie’s grip tightened around her phone. She couldn’t bring herself to say anything at the moment.
“Sadie, are you still there?” Tina prompted. “Did you hear what I just said?”
“I’m here,” Sadie said, snapping back to the present.
Tina chattered away for a while longer, then they hung up.
Sadie put her phone down and gazed out the window, looking lost and confused.
Had Noah really treated Kyla like that?
She was the woman he used to cherish and protect with everything he had.
How could he be so cold to her now?
Sadie couldn’t quite wrap her head around it.
What was going on inside Noah’s head?noveldrama
Sadie’s mind was swirling with unanswered questions that refused to go away. It was like a thick fog had descended over her, clouding her vision. She couldn’t understand Noah’s heart.
Soon, she became overwhelmed, struggling to breathe properly.
She shut her eyes and told herself to calm down.
Her office door suddenly opened, and Nanette walked in. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 376:
“Sadie, I’m almost done with the revisions for the Lawrence Group’s design drafts. Can you take a look and see if there’s anything else that needs adjusting?”
Just like that, the suffocating weight of Sadie’s chaotic thoughts was broken.
Sadie inhaled deeply, doing her best to maintain composure.
“Okay, let me see,” she said with a forced smile.
Nanette passed her the design sketches, her eyes lingering on Sadie’s unusually pale face.
“Are you alright? You don’t look well.”
“I’m fine. Probably just didn’t get enough sleep,” Sadie replied, avoiding Nanette’s gaze and beginning to study the sketches.
“Make sure you rest. Nothing is more important than your well-being,” Nanette advised with genuine concern.
“Yeah, I know,” Sadie replied absentmindedly, her mind far from the papers in front of her.
“Oh, by the way, Sadie.” Nanette suddenly remembered something and spoke excitedly. “Have you noticed? All the bad press about our studio is gone!”
Sadie’s fingers froze. Her attention shifted from the sketches to Nanette’s face.
“Gone?” she murmured, her voice hoarse, almost as if she were talking to herself.
Nanette nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah! I checked this morning. Every single post and comment—completely wiped out, like they never existed.”
A heavy feeling settled in Sadie’s chest, unease creeping up her spine.
That level of erasure wasn’t natural.
Someone was behind this.
But who? Her thoughts immediately landed on one name—Noah.
Once the idea took root, it refused to leave.
Her breathing grew uneven, palms clammy with sweat.
If Noah was responsible, what was his motive? Was he trying to protect her? Or did he have an entirely different reason?
She shook the thought away and forced herself to focus on the sketches.
“Alright, I see.”
Flipping through the pages quickly, Sadie skimmed over the details without truly absorbing them.
Clearing her throat, Sadie returned the drafts to Nanette and said, “These revisions work. Let’s proceed with them.”
“Got it.” Nanette accepted them, then added, “You should head home early. You need rest.”
“You too,” Sadie replied, struggling to sound normal.
As soon as Nanette left, Sadie leaned back in her chair, shutting her eyes. After a long pause, she opened them and glanced at her phone to check the time.
The workday was far from over, but she couldn’t stay any longer.
Grabbing her bag, she rose to her feet and left the office, her steps unsteady.
Meanwhile, Kyla and Vivi were talking on the phone.
“Kyla, you’re pathetic!” Vivi’s voice crackled through the phone, dripping with mockery. “Slimron? That’s all you amounted to?”
Kyla’s grip on her phone tightened, nails digging into her palm. “Vivi, knock it off! The project in Slimron may not be on the same level as those here, but it’s still a key assignment for Wall Group. Noah entrusted me with this challenge to train me!”
“Train you?” Vivi scoffed. “He dumped you in a desolate town, and you’re actually grateful? You’re so blinded by your feelings for Noah that you can’t even see what’s right in front of you! He sent you away because he’s done with you.”

###Chapter 377:
Kyla’s complexion drained, her lips turning pale.
She wanted to dismiss Vivi’s words, but deep down, she knew there was some truth to them.
“Vivi,” her voice trembled. She was unable to form a coherent thought.
“What?” Vivi pressed on, relentless in her verbal attack. “Do you still think you’re influential? Look at you now—you’re nothing! Noah doesn’t care about you anymore. To him, you don’t even exist!”
Kyla’s tears finally spilled over.
Vivi listened to the muffled sobs on the other end, unmoved. Instead of pity, she felt an odd sense of triumph.
“What’s the point of crying? Do you think that will bring Noah back?” Vivi spat. “I suggest you come to terms with reality. Noah no longer belongs to you. Even if you cry yourself blind, it won’t change a thing.”
As Kyla’s sobs echoed through the line, Vivi’s mind started working.
Teaming up with Kyla offered no advantages.
The woman was unraveling, too unstable to be useful.
If she could secure a job at Wall Group and find a way to win Noah over, everything would shift in her favor.
A cunning smile played on Vivi’s lips as the idea took shape.
“Enough with the tears,” she suddenly said, her voice gentler. “Not all hope is lost.”
Kyla sniffled, slowly regaining composure.
“Really?” she whispered, her voice raw. “You’ll help me?”
“Of course,” Vivi assured her smoothly.

“Kyla, do you know Noah well?” Vivi’s voice was soft, almost coaxing, laced with subtle intent. “I mean… what does he like? What does he hate?”
Kyla hesitated. For a moment, uncertainty flickered across her face before she exhaled, allowing years of carefully gathered knowledge to spill out. Every preference, every pet peeve—she laid them bare, as though offering up Noah’s world.
Vivi listened, nodding thoughtfully, her responses measured, her mind filtering through what was useful and what was irrelevant.
Then, just as Kyla’s voice wavered, Vivi’s lips curled into a slow, knowing smile.
“Alright, enough with the tears.” Her tone remained gentle, yet a dangerous undercurrent ran beneath it. “I’ll help you. Don’t worry—I’ll make sure you get Noah back.”
As soon as the call ended, the warmth in Vivi’s expression vanished like a fleeting illusion.
“Kyla, you really are a fool,” Vivi sighed, barely suppressing her disdain. Then, with a calculated air, she dialed another number.
“Hello. Can you check Noah Wall’s schedule for tonight?”
After a while, Vivi ended the call, her lips curling ever so slightly.
“Mountmend Manor… a charity gala… I see.” A flicker of determination lit her eyes as she whispered to herself, “Seems like tonight is the perfect opportunity.”
With quiet deliberation, she made her way to her wardrobe, letting her gaze sweep over an array of exquisite gowns. After a moment’s contemplation, she reached for a champagne-colored dress.
The fabric draped over her curves like liquid gold, flawlessly tailored to accentuate every contour of her frame. Its soft hue complemented her porcelain skin, exuding both grace and allure.noveldrama
Turning to her vanity, Vivi applied her makeup with practiced precision—her eyes lined just enough to captivate, her lips painted a subtle yet enticing shade. With a delicate touch, she twisted her long hair into an elegant updo, leaving just enough strands loose to frame her face in effortless sophistication, Vivi admired her reflection in the mirror. As the finishing touch, she reached for a bottle of perfume, letting a mist of refreshing fragrance settle over her skin.

###Chapter 378:
Satisfied, she studied her reflection, tilting her head slightly as a slow, knowing smile spread across her lips. “Noah, tonight, you will definitely notice me.”
Meanwhile, across town, Sadie pushed open the doors of Myrtlewood Estate, instantly enveloped by the familiar, comforting scent of home-cooked dishes. From the kitchen, Laura emerged, an apron tied neatly around her waist, carrying a steaming bowl of soup. A gentle smile softened her features.
“You’re home, Sadie. You must be exhausted,” she said, setting the bowl down with care. “Come, have some soup. I made your favorite.”
Sadie took the bowl in her hands, its warmth seeping through her fingertips. She lifted the spoon and took a small sip, letting the rich, velvety flavor settle on her tongue.
“Grandma, you didn’t have to cook again,” Sadie said, setting the bowl down with a sigh, her voice laced with exhaustion. “I could’ve just grabbed something simple.”
Laura clicked her tongue, her warm eyes filled with quiet reproach. “You silly child. No matter how busy work gets, your health should always come first.” She reached out, gently cupping Sadie’s face, her touch soft yet firm. “Look at you—you’ve lost so much weight.”
Sadie offered a tired smile. Before she could protest, Laura continued, “Oh, that reminds me—Noah’s back. He should be in the study.”
The words landed like a stone in still water, sending ripples through Sadie’s thoughts.
“He’s… back?”noveldrama
Laura nodded, her tone light. “Yes, just a little while ago. He’s probably drowning in work again.” She gestured toward another steaming bowl. “Take this to him, will you? The man needs to eat.”
A beat of silence passed before Sadie drew in a quiet breath and nodded.
“Alright.”
Your next story starts here: g?lnσνs?com
She turned, steadying herself before stepping toward the study.
The door stood slightly ajar, a sliver of light spilling into the dim hallway. Sadie paused, her heartbeat a quiet drum against her ribs, before she gently nudged the door open.
Inside, Noah sat at his desk, his attention fixed on the glow of his laptop screen. The light cast sharp shadows along the planes of his face, accentuating the strong, chiseled angles.
His dark gray shirt clung to his broad frame, sleeves pushed up just enough to reveal the sculpted lines of his forearms.
The creak of the door broke the silence.
His gaze lifted.
“What is it?” Noah’s voice was cool, devoid of warmth.
Sadie stepped forward, placing the bowl gently on his desk.
“Grandma made soup. She asked me to bring it to you.” Her tone was soft, almost hesitant, as though she was afraid of disturbing him.
Noah’s gaze flickered to the bowl, then back to her. For a fleeting moment, something unspoken passed through his eyes—something unreadable.
“Just leave it.” His attention dropped back to his laptop, fingers poised over the keyboard.
The air in the study grew heavier. Sadie shifted on her feet, searching for something to say.
“How was your day?” The question formed in her mind but felt pointless—like a bridge too fragile to cross.
She exhaled lightly, her voice quiet. “Well, I’ll just leave you to it.” She turned toward the door.
“Hold on.” Noah’s voice stopped her mid-step.
She turned back, meeting his gaze.

###Chapter 379:
“Where’s Averi?”
“He… went to Slimron for an educational trip. He’ll be away for a few days.”
Noah gave a small nod. He said nothing more.
Noah reached for an exquisite box on the desk, its surface gleaming under the soft light. He held it out to Sadie, his movements deliberate yet effortless.
“There’s a charity event tonight,” he said, his voice low and steady. “I’d like you to come with me.”noveldrama
Sadie froze, her eyes darting between the box and Noah’s impassive face.
“Me?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. She pointed at herself to confirm he wasn’t mistaken. The idea seemed absurd, almost surreal.
Noah gave a slight nod, his expression unreadable, but his tone left no room for argument.
“Yes. I need a date.”
Sadie’s first instinct was to refuse. But then, Nanette’s words echoed in her mind, a reminder of what Noah had done for her and her studio.
“Alright,” Sadie heard herself say, the word escaping before she could second-guess it.
Her heart skipped a beat as she reached for the box, her fingers brushing against the plush velvet, a strange mix of anticipation and unease swirling in her chest.
Noah’s eyes lingered on her, dark and inscrutable, as if he were trying to decipher something Sadie herself couldn’t quite understand.
“We’ll leave at seven,” Noah said, his tone final. Without another word, he lowered his head, his attention shifting back to the glowing screen of his laptop. Sadie left the study, clutching the box in her hands.
Once back in her room, she carefully opened it, revealing a breathtaking deep blue evening gown. Tiny crystals were scattered across the fabric, catching the light like stars scattered across a midnight sky. Her heart quickened as her fingers glided over the smooth, luxurious material, and a flutter of anticipation and nervousness stirred in her chest.
Time seemed to slip away as Sadie prepared herself. She slipped into the gown, the fabric draping perfectly over her figure as though it had been made just for her. Standing in front of the mirror, she carefully styled her hair and applied a touch of makeup, her hands trembling slightly with nervous anticipation.
Your escape begins at g?lnσνs?com
At precisely seven o’clock, there was a knock at her door.
Sadie took a deep breath, steadying herself, before she walked toward the door.
When she opened the door, Noah stood there, looking every bit the picture of distinction in a sharp black suit. His gaze immediately locked on her, and for a brief moment, she saw something like admiration flash in his eyes—something deeper than simple politeness. The starry gown she wore only seemed to enhance her natural elegance, the crystals catching the light in a way that made her appear almost otherworldly.
“You look stunning,” Noah said, his voice warm and sincere.
Sadie’s cheeks flushed, and she lowered her gaze momentarily. Her heart fluttered in response to the compliment, and she whispered softly, “Thank you.”
Noah extended his arm with a subtle, inviting gesture. “Shall we?”
Sadie hesitated for the briefest moment, her heart pounding in her chest. Then, with a small nod, she placed her hand gently on his arm, her touch light but deliberate.
Together, they walked out of the villa, the night air cool and crisp around them. The chauffeur stood beside the sleek car, its engine humming softly, ready to carry them.
The car ride was charged with an undercurrent of tension.
Sadie couldn’t help but steal occasional glances at Noah, who sat beside her, his demeanor as composed as ever. His face revealed nothing, and his thoughts were inscrutable, like the darkening night outside the window.

###Chapter 380:
“Feeling a little nervous?” Noah’s voice broke the stillness, his tone light.
Sadie hesitated for a moment before nodding. “A little,” she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper.
Noah’s lips quirked slightly, a reassuring smile playing at the corners. “Relax. I’m with you.”
Sadie nodded, trying to steady her racing heart. Outside the window, the city blurred into a mix of lights and shadows, but inside, her mind swirled with uncertainty.
When they arrived at Mountmend Manor, the venue’s grandeur took Sadie’s breath away. The manor was a vision of elegance, its towering facade illuminated by soft golden lights. Inside, the banquet hall was a dazzling spectacle of chandeliers, flowing gowns, and the low murmur of polished conversation. Sadie stepped inside, her arm linked with Noah’s. She could feel the weight of curious glances, some admiring and others speculative, as they made their way through the crowd.
“Mr. Wall, it’s been quite some time.” A woman in an extravagant gown greeted Noah, her smile warm but calculated.
“Indeed, Ms. Lindsay,” Noah responded politely.
Maria Lindsay turned her attention to Sadie, her gaze sharp with curiosity. “And who might this be?” she asked, her tone revealing a keen interest.
Noah looked at Sadie for a moment before answering. “This is my wife, Sadie,” he said with quiet finality, his words deliberate and calm.
The words hit Sadie like a thunderclap, leaving her momentarily frozen. Her mind went blank, and her breath caught in her throat.
My wife… The phrase echoed in Sadie’s ears, each syllable reverberating through her chest like a heavy hammer.
Maria’s smile faltered briefly, a shadow crossing her face before she quickly recovered, her expression brightening even further.

“Ah, so this is Mrs. Wall,” she said, her voice dripping with forced sweetness. “A pleasure to meet you! Mrs. Wall, you truly have an extraordinary presence. You and Mr. Wall make quite the pair.”
The words hung in the air, and Sadie could feel the room’s attention shifting toward her. Whispers rippled through the crowd, and the guests exchanged glances, their curiosity palpable. Sadie’s grip tightened on her small clutch, her knuckles turning white as she fought to maintain her composure. She felt like a deer caught in headlights, exposed and vulnerable under the scrutiny of so many eyes.noveldrama
“Mr. Wall, you’re truly fortunate to have such a beautiful wife,” a man in a tailored suit remarked as he approached, raising his glass in a toast to Noah.
Noah offered a faint smile, raising his glass in acknowledgment. “Thank you,” he replied, his tone calm and unbothered. He offered no further explanation, nor did he glance at Sadie to gauge her reaction. It was as though his earlier declaration had been nothing more than a casual remark.
For the rest of the evening, Sadie felt like a marionette, mechanically following Noah’s lead as they mingled with the guests. She forced herself to smile, her lips stretching into a gesture she hoped looked natural. But the stiffness in her shoulders and the tightening of her chest betrayed her inner disquiet. The unease gnawed at her, a constant undercurrent beneath the facade she desperately tried to maintain.
A woman, her gown sparkling in the light, leaned in with a curious glint in her eyes. “Mrs. Wall, that ring you’re wearing is simply stunning,” she remarked, her voice laced with intrigue. She reached for Sadie’s hand, drawing it closer for a better look. “Did Mr. Wall give it to you?”
Sadie instinctively wanted to pull her hand back, but the woman’s grip was firm, her fingers cold against Sadie’s skin.
“I bought it myself,” Sadie replied, her voice steady despite the discomfort.
“Really?” The woman’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Mrs. Wall, you have exquisite taste. This ring may seem simple at first glance, but there’s a unique elegance to it.” 
.

###Chapter 381:
The woman remained oblivious to Sadie’s discomfort, continuing to gush over the ring with unrelenting enthusiasm.
Sadie could only muster a wry smile, choosing silence over an unnecessary response.
Then, a familiar voice cut through the air. “Sadie, come here for a moment.” Noah’s voice. Relief washed over Sadie like a breath of fresh air. Without hesitation, she turned and quickly made her way toward him.
“What is it?” she asked, her voice quieter now that she was standing beside him.
“Eva’s here. Let’s go say hello.”
It was only then that Sadie noticed the striking woman in a crimson gown standing nearby. Eva Shaw.
The deep red of her dress clung effortlessly to her figure, the rich waves of her hair cascading over her shoulders. Her lips, painted a bold scarlet, curled into a knowing smile.
Sadie straightened herself and approached with practiced grace. “Ms. Shaw, it’s a pleasure to see you.”
“Oh my! If it isn’t Sadie, the brilliant designer!” Eva said, pulling her into a light embrace. “You look absolutely breathtaking tonight, darling.” As she pulled back, her gaze flitted playfully between Sadie and Noah, the corners of her lips curving into something unreadable—half amusement, half intrigue.
“And Mr. Wall…” She smirked, tilting her head slightly. “You look exceptionally dashing tonight.”
Noah responded with a faint, unreadable smile, offering no words in return.
Eva’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “My, my… You two standing together like this—it’s almost unfair.” She let out a teasing sigh. “Such a perfect pair. A picture of elegance, really.”
Sadie wasn’t sure if she wanted to acknowledge them—or pretend she hadn’t heard them at all.
gα?ησν?sоm, where stories thrive
Eva, ever perceptive, raised her champagne flute in a casual toast, her gaze flitting mischievously between Sadie and Noah. A knowing smile played on her lips, brimming with amusement.
“Mr. Wall, no matter how much I pried before, you never gave anything away. Turns out, you’ve been keeping a secret all this time.” She took a languid sip of her champagne, the teasing lilt in her voice unmistakable. “Finally decided to bring her out and introduce her to the world, huh?”
Sadie’s blush deepened. She shifted uncomfortably, tugging lightly at the fabric of her dress as if it could somehow shield her from the attention.
A fleeting glance at Noah offered no relief—his expression remained infuriatingly composed.
Then, unexpectedly, his gaze flicked toward the glass in Eva’s hand, his tone effortlessly smooth. “I’ve heard you’ve taken quite a liking to Enrique Craig.”noveldrama
Eva’s confident demeanor faltered. Her fingers tensed around the delicate stem of her glass, the champagne inside wobbling precariously.
Her eyes widened, the playful sparkle in them momentarily replaced by shock. “How… how did you know?”
Noah didn’t answer. He merely lifted an eyebrow, a faint, knowing smirk curling his lips.
Eva’s throat bobbed as she cleared it, quickly regaining her composure. She exhaled, waving a dismissive hand before changing the subject. “Sadie, darling, your necklace is lovely! Where did you get it?”
Before Sadie could respond, a waiter rushed past, balancing a tray of wine glasses.
Perhaps due to nerves—or sheer bad luck—his hand trembled, and the tray tipped just enough to send a glass of deep red wine tumbling. 
.

.
###Chapter 382:
Time seemed to slow as the liquid splashed across Noah’s crisp white shirt.
“Oh no, Mr. Wall! I—I didn’t mean to!” The waiter’s face turned ghostly pale, his voice frantic as he fumbled for words. “I’m terribly sorry!”
Noah’s expression darkened as he attempted to brush away the deep red stain, only for it to smear further across the white fabric.
Before he could say anything, the event manager rushed over, his tone laced with urgency. “Mr. Wall, I sincerely apologize for this mishap. Please, allow me to escort you to the lounge so you can change.”
Noah exhaled slowly, annoyance flickering across his features. Then, with a brief glance at Sadie, he gave a small nod. “I won’t be long,” he muttered.
Sadie nodded back, watching as he strode away, a strange unease settling in her chest.
“Miss Hudson, what an unexpected pleasure.” A poised, melodic voice drifted through the air.
Sadie turned to see a striking woman approaching, her gown a cascade of shimmering fabric that caught the light with every measured step. There was an effortless grace to her.
Sadie offered a polite smile. “Good evening, Mrs. Lawrence.” It was Leanna, the wife of the Lawrence Group’s CEO.
Leanna’s crimson lips curved slightly, amusement dancing in her eyes. “Your designs left quite the impression on me the last time we met.” She tilted her head slightly, studying Sadie with quiet intrigue. “And now, fate brings us together again. How delightful.”
Sadie met her gaze, poised and composed. “That’s very kind of you to say, Mrs. Lawrence. I appreciate it.”
“Your designs have such a distinct spirit—elegant yet undeniably bold,” Leanna mused, her gaze appraising. “I truly admire young designers with a vision as unique as yours.”
?σ? υ ι .
Sadie smiled politely. “Thank you, Mrs. Lawrence.”
Yet, even as she responded, her mind was elsewhere—on Noah. It was just a simple matter of changing clothes, nothing worth overthinking. And yet, unease curled in her chest.
“I love the Ten Year Promise collection you designed so much,” Leanna continued, tilting her head slightly. “If you’re available, I’d love the opportunity to discuss your creative process in more depth.”
Sadie met her gaze with a composed nod. “Of course, Mrs. Lawrence. It would be an honor.”
The hall shimmered under the golden glow of chandeliers, the hum of lively conversation and the delicate clinking of glasses weaving through the air like a melody.
Eva caught the flicker of unease on Sadie’s face. With a quick sip of champagne, she quipped, “Why is Mr. Wall taking so long to change? Did he lose his way?”
Sadie managed a forced smile. “I doubt it. He’s with the manager.”
Eva placed her glass down and grasped Sadie’s hand. “Let’s go check. Perhaps we can assist!” Her eyes sparkled with playful mischief.
Before Sadie could protest, Eva was already leading her toward the lounge.
Inside, Noah, with his wine-stained shirt removed, revealed a toned chest. He reached for a clean shirt on the hanger.
Just then, the door burst open.
Vivi appeared at the threshold, a look of feigned surprise on her face. “Mr. Wall? What are you doing here?”
Noah paused, frowning slightly. He recognized her—it was Vivi, whom he had met before at the Starlight Gala.
Vivi clasped her hand over her mouth, feigning shock. “Oh! I’m sorry, Mr. Wall, I must have entered the wrong room!”

###Chapter 383:
Yet, she made no move to leave, stepping further into the room, her eyes boldly scanning Noah.
“It was such a pleasure to meet you at the Starlight Gala. I didn’t expect our paths to cross again,” she cooed, her voice dripping with saccharine sweetness.
Noah gave her a frosty look, his voice icy. “I don’t recall that.” He continued dressing, disregarding Vivi’s flirty demeanor.
Her smile stiffened as she felt a surge of resentment. She hadn’t anticipated such indifference, him completely ignoring her presence.
“Mr. Wall, your memory seems quite selective.” Vivi pressed on, masking her irritation. “I’m Vivi from the Quinn family, and the chief designer of Majestic Ego.”
Noah finished buttoning his shirt and met her gaze, his patience wearing thin. “Is there something you want?”
“No… nothing really.” Vivi felt a pang of guilt under Noah’s scrutinizing gaze but refused to back down. “I just wanted to say hello. It’s fate that we meet here.”
“I don’t believe in fate,” Noah replied coldly, turning and walking towards the bathroom to freshen up.
Vivi’s face paled, then flushed with embarrassment.
Just then, the lounge door swung open again.
“Noah, why are you taking so long to change—” Eva’s voice halted abruptly when she saw Vivi in the room.
Behind Eva, Sadie entered, her heart dropping at the scene.
Vivi, caught off guard by their presence, quickly masked her panic.
“Ms. Shaw, Sadie, hello,” Vivi exclaimed, feigning surprise.
Eva gave Vivi a knowing smile, her voice dripping with insinuation. “Hello, Miss Quinn, what a coincidence.”
LΑττ chαρτ?rs ιn glov?l.
“I must have entered the wrong room,” Vivi stammered, her face stiffening. She knew Eva was a formidable presence and wanted to sidestep any conflict.
“Oh? Really?” Eva raised an eyebrow. “This lounge is reserved for Noah. How could you have made such a mistake?”
Caught off guard, Vivi struggled to find an excuse.
Noah stepped out of the bathroom, immediately sensing the tension in the room, his frown deepening.
Sadie felt a suffocating pressure in her chest, standing motionless.
She clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms, yet she felt no pain.
Vivi noticed Sadie’s distress and allowed a slight smirk to cross her face.
She cast a flirtatious look at Noah, her voice soft. “Mr. Wall, I’ll be leaving now.” With that, she turned and sashayed out of the lounge, her high heels clicking against the floor.
Eva glanced at Sadie and Noah, her eyes sparkling with playful amusement. “Oh dear, young people are always so impulsive. I’m just an old-timer, so I’ll leave you to it.”
With a graceful turn, she gently closed the door behind her, leaving Sadie and Noah alone.
The lounge was now thick with an awkward and tense atmosphere, so stifling it was hard to breathe.
Sadie bit her lip, striving to maintain her composure.
She reminded herself that she and Noah were on the brink of divorce.
None of this should matter anymore. Taking a deep breath, she turned to leave. But in the next instant, a strong hand clasped her wrist tightly and pulled her back. Her back hit the door with a thud.
“Noah, what are you doing?” Sadie exclaimed, struggling to free herself.noveldrama
Noah remained silent, instead leaning in to capture her lips in a forceful kiss. It was a dominant and intense kiss, charged with pent-up anger and unspoken feelings. 
.

###Chapter 384:
Sadie’s mind reeled. She pushed against him, but he was immovable. His presence was overwhelming, leaving her breathless and unable to think clearly.noveldrama
Gradually, her resistance waned. She closed her eyes, yielding to the intensity of his embrace.
After a prolonged moment, Noah finally let her go, his gaze intense and his breathing heavy.
Sadie’s lips felt tender, her breathing ragged, her eyes wide with confusion.
“Noah…” She started to speak, but he cut her off.
“Why don’t you ask?” Noah’s voice was low and raspy.
Confused, Sadie paused, unsure of his meaning.
“Vivi.”
Noah’s voice was low and rough, laced with something unspoken—an emotion buried deep, restrained yet unmistakable.
Sadie snapped back to the present, suppressing the whirlwind inside her. “Mr. Wall, what does your affair with Miss Quinn have to do with me?”
The words were delivered with a chilling detachment, but beneath them, she held tightly onto the unraveling threads of her emotions. Vivi. Or anyone else. It had nothing to do with her.
Noah’s expression darkened. This wasn’t the reaction he had expected. He had braced himself for anger, for accusations, for the fire that once flared in her eyes three years ago.
His jaw tightened as he studied her face, searching for something—anything—beneath that composed mask. But there was nothing.
“Sadie.” Her name slipped from his lips, quieter this time. “Do you really not care?”
“Care?” Sadie tilted her head slightly, her lips curling into something dangerously close to mockery. “And why would I?” She held his gaze, unwavering. “Should I concern myself with your fleeting indulgences, Mr. Wall?” Her voice was velvety smooth, but her words were razor-sharp. “Or your feelings?”
Noah’s breath hitched for half a second—just long enough for her to notice. Before he could respond, there was a knock on the door.
“Mr. Wall, the charity auction is about to begin. Will you and Mrs. Wall be taking your seats now?” The manager’s voice, laced with careful deference, drifted from outside the lounge.
Sadie seized the moment like a lifeline. Without hesitation, she stepped past Noah, pushing the door open with a sense of urgency. “We’re heading over now,” she responded smoothly.
Noah remained where he stood for a moment, watching her slip away from him like sand through his fingers. A quiet ache settled in his chest—a weight he couldn’t quite define.
He exhaled slowly, running a hand through his hair before following her out.
As they stepped into the grand banquet hall, the air seemed to shift. Eyes turned toward them instantly, conversations dimming under the weight of their presence.
Across the room, Eva lounged in her seat, swirling her champagne with a knowing smirk. Her gaze flickered between them, amusement dancing in her eyes.
Ah, now this was getting interesting.
Meanwhile, Vivi sat rigid, her nails digging into her palms.
She had just found out that Sadie was actually Noah’s wife.
For three years, women had flitted in and out of Noah’s orbit. Some lingering, most forgotten. But never—never—had Vivi heard a whisper of him being married.
The buzz of excitement swirled through the elegantly dressed guests as bids were placed one after another. 
.

.
###Chapter 385:
Sadie absently flipped through the auction catalog, her mind elsewhere—until her fingers froze mid-turn.
Staring back at her from the glossy page was an image of a vintage string of beads—intricately carved, uniquely designed.
A piece unlike any other.
Her pulse quickened.
A sharp tremor ran through her fingertips as she traced the photo in disbelief. It had belonged to her mother. The very string of beads that had disappeared with her all those years ago.
Sadie had scoured everywhere, searched endlessly—but the string had vanished without a trace. She had long abandoned the hope of ever seeing it again.
And yet, here it was. On display. For sale.
Her chest tightened, a flood of emotions crashing over her—shock, disbelief, and an ache so deep it nearly stole her breath.
Noah, ever observant, noticed the shift in her demeanor. “What’s wrong?”noveldrama
Sadie inhaled sharply, forcing herself to steady her racing heart. She pointed to the image, her voice barely above a whisper and trembling with restrained emotion. “This string of beads… It belonged to my mother.”
Noah’s expression darkened slightly as he followed her gaze to the catalog. His brow furrowed. “Are you certain?”
“Without a doubt. My mother carved this herself. I would never mistake it.”
Step into new worlds at g ? lnσ ν ?s?conn
The auctioneer’s voice rang out across the hall, smooth and commanding.
“Starting bid, 500 thousand.”
Sadie barely hesitated. “One million.”
A collective murmur spread through the room, surprised gasps punctuating the air.
One million—for a simple string of beads? It wasn’t an antique, nor a piece of fine jewelry. And yet, Sadie had doubled the starting bid in an instant. Because for her, this was more than just an auction item.
It was a clue to the mother she had spent years searching for.
But just as the auctioneer was about to speak, a slow, saccharine voice chimed in. “One million one hundred thousand.”
Sadie’s gaze snapped toward the voice. Vivi?
Amusement flickered in Vivi’s eyes, her red lips curving into a knowing smirk. “Sadie, it seems you are also quite interested in this item.”
Sadie met her gaze head-on, her expression unshaken. “This string of beads holds great significance for me.”
Vivi let out a quiet chuckle, tilting her head. “Oh? What a coincidence.” She tapped her paddle lightly against her fingertips. “I’ve suddenly decided I must have it as well.”
“One million five hundred thousand.” Sadie’s grip tightened around her paddle.
But Vivi arched an eyebrow, her smirk deepening. “One million six hundred thousand.”
“One million seven hundred thousand.” Sadie’s voice quavered slightly.
“One million eight hundred thousand,” Vivi countered with a sneer of disdain. As Sadie inhaled, preparing to bid again, a large hand pressed her paddle down.
Turning, she met Noah’s intense gaze.
“Two million,” he stated calmly, his voice resonating with authority.
A murmur of astonishment rippled through the room.
Two million for a string of beads of dubious authenticity was nothing short of madness.
Vivi’s face twisted with surprise; she hadn’t anticipated Noah’s involvement.
“Mr. Wall, what is the meaning of this?” she demanded. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 386:
Noah ignored her, his eyes softening as he looked at Sadie. “If you like it, we should get it.”
A wave of warmth flooded Sadie, her heart fluttering with gratitude.
Noah was clearly supporting her.
Vivi’s expression darkened, her hands balling into fists, nails digging into her palms.
“Two million one hundred thousand!” she spat, teeth clenched.
Noah regarded her with cool detachment. “Two million five hundred thousand.”
Vivi gasped, unprepared for his unwavering determination. Her eyes shot daggers at Sadie, brimming with poisonous jealousy.
What made Sadie so special?
“Two million six hundred thousand!” Vivi yelled, bordering on hysteria.
“Three million,” Noah replied, his tone as calm as ever.
A hush descended upon the hall.
Three million far exceeded the item’s true value.
Vivi’s complexion blanched; she was outmatched.
Dejected, she slumped in defeat as Noah clinched the auction at three million.
The auctioneer’s gavel sounded, finalizing the purchase.
Noah turned to Sadie, his smile gentle. “How do you like it?”
Tears shimmered in Sadie’s eyes as she nodded emphatically. “I love it.”
Noah carefully put the string of beads on her wrist, his touch tender. “It suits you perfectly.”
Mσrε υpdαтes ιn Gαlnσνels.cσm
Vivi observed the tender scene, her jealousy boiling over.
With a harsh scrape of her chair, she stood and stormed out of the banquet hall.
Noah’s phone vibrated, shattering the quiet of the room.
He glanced at the caller ID, his eyebrows knitting together.
Leaning toward Sadie, he murmured, “I need to take this call.” Stepping away, he answered with a firm voice.
Watching him move away, Sadie felt a stir of unease.
She gripped the bead string, her fingertips turning cold.
“What is it?” Noah’s tone was terse, laced with impatience.
The voice on the other end sounded rushed, reporting something urgent.
Noah’s face hardened as he listened.
“I understand,” he responded coolly, “I’ll be there shortly.” After hanging up, Noah turned back to Sadie.noveldrama
“There’s an urgent issue at the company,” he explained. “I have to leave.”
Sadie paused momentarily before nodding. “It’s late. Be careful on the road,” she said, her voice carrying a trace of concern.
Noah looked at her intently, his expression complex.
He lightly ruffled her hair, his voice softening. “Wait for me.” With that, he swiftly exited the banquet hall.
Sadie watched him go, her emotions tangled.
Once Noah had left, her thoughts drifted back to the bead string.
Eager to uncover its origins and possibly find clues about her mother, she approached a staff member. “Excuse me, could you tell me who consigned this bead string for auction?”
Initially indifferent, the staff member’s demeanor changed to one of respect when he noticed the bead string on Sadie’s wrist, implying her significant relationship with Noah. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 387:
“Good evening, Mrs. Wall,” the staff member said, his tone deferential. “This bead string was consigned by our boss.”
“Your boss?” Sadie pressed on. “Could you give me their contact information? I’d like to speak with them.”
The staff member pulled a business card from his pocket and handed it to Sadie. “This is our boss’s private number. Feel free to contact him directly.”
Sadie took the card, offered her thanks, and dialed the number immediately.
“Hello, who…”noveldrama
“This is Sadie Hudson,” Sadie responded crisply. “I’m inquiring about the origins of the bead string from today’s auction.”
A pause hung on the line before a deep male voice answered, “I’m aware of who you are, Mrs. Wall. We should discuss the bead string in person.”
“Alright,” Sadie agreed promptly. “You set the time and place.”
The man provided an address and time, which Sadie noted carefully. After the call ended, the slight quickening of her pulse betrayed Sadie’s anticipation.
She secured the business card in her purse.
As she was about to leave the auction venue, a sharp voice halted her. “Well, if it isn’t the renowned designer, Sadie?”
Sadie stopped, recognizing the voice instantly.
It was Vivi.
Turning slowly, Sadie fixed a steady gaze on her.
“Do you need something?” Her tone was cool, indicating her disinterest in any conversation.
Vivi stepped closer with a sneer, her eyes scanning Sadie provocatively. “So, you think you’ve made it big now that you are married to Noah? Remember, you’re just a…”
L?t?st ?hpt?rs ιn glnovе.
“Miss Quinn,” Sadie cut her off firmly. “You seem to be confused. It’s not about who I am. The point is, you’re blocking my way.”
Vivi, taken aback by Sadie’s assertive response, flushed with anger. “What are you implying? Who do you think you are? Noah’s wife? Ha! Do you really believe he loves you? He’s just using you.
Do you honestly think you can take Kyla’s place in Noah’s heart?”
Sadie’s gaze turned icy as she tightened her grip on her bag.
“What goes on between Noah and myself is not your concern, just as Kyla’s affairs are her own,” she declared with resolve.
“Keep up the facade!” Vivi sneered. “Do you really think that string of beads means anything? It’s worthless! You’ll never possess what Kyla does!”
A shadow crossed Sadie’s eyes, yet her lips curled into a mocking smile.
“Worthless? Miss Quinn, your familiarity with the items Kyla owns is curious. It’s almost as if…” Sadie paused deliberately, her eyes locked on Vivi’s, which stiffened. After a moment, she concluded, “You’re Kyla’s spokesperson.”
Color rose in Vivi’s cheeks, then drained away as though Sadie’s words had struck deep.
“You’re talking nonsense! I’m not involved with Kyla!”
“Really?” Sadie raised an eyebrow. “You’ve been bringing up Kyla repeatedly since we started talking. Are you trying to defend her, or to chase after Noah?” Sadie let the question hang in the air, giving Vivi a meaningful glance before she moved to step past her.
Vivi, visibly shaken by the insinuation that touched on her hidden secret, reacted sharply.
“Stop right there!” She reached out, seizing Sadie’s arm. “What right do you have to make such accusations?”
Sadie wrenched her arm away, her expression steely. “Miss Quinn, it’s not for you to decide if I have the right. But your continual provocations—do you really believe they will go unanswered?”

###Chapter 388:
Vivi, taken aback by Sadie’s intense demeanor, struggled for words.
Ignoring her, Sadie turned and strode away.
Vivi watched her go, shaking with fury.
She had always been the center of attention and had never been so publicly humiliated.
At Majestic Ego, it had always been Sadie who outshone her.
Now that she was back in the country, Vivi had hoped for revenge against her old rival. However, Sadie remained a formidable adversary. Gritting her teeth, Vivi pulled out her phone and dialed a number.
“Hello, I need a thorough investigation of Sadie’s studio, and I need it done quickly,” Vivi ordered, her tone brooking no dissent.
On the other end of the line, a voice responded with deference, “Absolutely, Miss Quinn. I’ll handle it right away.”
Half an hour later, Sadie pushed open the door to her home.
“Grandma, I’m home.”
In the living room, Laura was seated on the sofa, knitting. She looked up, her face lighting up. “Oh, Sadie, welcome back.”
Crossing the room, Sadie embraced her grandmother gently. “Thanks for everything, Grandma.”
“My dear, no need for formalities with me.” Laura chuckled, warmth in her smile as she touched Sadie’s hand.
“Tomorrow’s plans might keep me out late; I have an important meeting.”
Laura’s eyebrows rose with concern. “Who will you be meeting?”
Sadie paused, her expression complex, hinting at the weight of the meeting. “Someone crucial. If it goes well, I might finally find Mom.”

Laura stopped knitting, her eyes brightening with a mixture of hope and excitement.
“Really? Do you believe you can find her?”
Grasping Laura’s hands reassuringly, Sadie nodded firmly. “Yes, I’m going to find Mom. And I’ll make sure you both are with me.”
Laura’s eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she gently nodded, her voice filled with quiet conviction. “Good. I… I believe in you, Sadie.”
The next morning, golden sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting delicate patterns across the wooden floor. Sadie stood before the mirror, her reflection poised yet contemplative. Dressed in an understated professional ensemble, she carefully smoothed the fabric, ensuring every detail was in place. With a measured breath, she adjusted her collar, exhaling softly before reaching for her bag.
The car rolled to a stop in front of an elegant cafe, its castle-like facade exuding timeless charm. Sadie shifted into park, lingering for a moment as she took in the sight before her. Her gaze lifted to the cafe’s sign—Gentle Breeze.
Following the address given to her the night before, Sadie had arrived. Taking a steadying breath, she pushed open the door, immediately greeted by the rich, comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee.
The cafe’s interior was simple yet refined. The soft lighting and serene atmosphere made one feel instantly at ease. A waitress in a neatly pressed dress approached with a polite smile. “Good day, ma’am. Do you have a reservation?”
Sadie returned the smile briefly. “Yes, I have an appointment in Room Serenity.”
The waitress nodded. “Right this way, please.”
They moved past a series of elegant booths and toward the more private section of the cafe. “Excuse me, sir. Your guest has arrived.”
“Please come in,” a deep, measured voice responded from within.
Sadie inhaled quietly, steeling herself before pushing open the door.

###Chapter 389:
Inside, the scent of coffee deepened, mingling with the faint notes of polished wood and aged books. A middle-aged man sat at a sleek coffee table, his movements precise as he carefully poured coffee from a silver pot.
He was dressed in a simple gray suit, his hair neatly combed back, and his expression carried a quiet warmth. At the sight of her, he set the coffee pot down and rose to his feet with an easy grace.
“It’s nice to meet you in person, Miss Hudson. I’m Matthew Duncan.”
Sadie dipped her head slightly in greeting, her voice poised and polite. “Nice to meet you as well, Mr. Duncan.”
Matthew gestured toward the chair opposite him. “Please, have a seat.” Without hesitation, Sadie settled into the chair.
Matthew wasted no time. “Miss Hudson, you want to know the origins of this string of beads?”
Sadie nodded and handed over the string of beads. “Yes. This piece… it’s more than just jewelry to me.”
Matthew turned it over in his hand, studying the delicate carvings with quiet reverence. After a pause, he spoke slowly. “I acquired it three years ago… from a woman.”
“That woman… do you still have any way of reaching her? A phone number? An address?” Sadie leaned forward instinctively, her grip tightening on the leather bag in her lap.
Matthew sighed. “That woman was a cautious one—reserved, deliberate.” He reached into a drawer, rifling through its contents before retrieving a single, yellowed piece of paper. “This is all I have.” He slid the fragile slip across the table. “Three years is a long time. I can’t say for sure if the number is still active.”
Sadie clutched the paper, her grip tightening as if it might disappear. This—this lone set of digits—was the key to finding her mother.
Her voice was thick with emotion as she whispered, “Thank you, Mr. Duncan.”noveldrama

Matthew offered her a kind smile. “I hope this number leads you to the answers you’re looking for.”
Sadie rose to her feet, bowing her head slightly in gratitude before turning toward the door.
Outside, the air felt different now—heavier with possibility. She walked to her car, slid into the driver’s seat, and closed the door behind her with a soft click. For a long moment, she simply stared at the numbers in her hand. A thin sheen of sweat dampened her palm. She took a deep, trembling breath as she pressed the start button, the engine humming to life.
Her hands clutched the steering wheel, but her mind was elsewhere—lost in a whirlwind of memories. Her mother’s voice. Her mother’s laughter.
The drive felt endless. Finally, she pulled over, the car rolling to a slow stop at the roadside. For a moment, she just sat there, gripping the piece of paper as though it held the answers to her past.
A single call. That was all it took to find out if this was a real lead—or another dead end.
Sadie’s fingers trembled as she pressed the dial button and lifted the phone to her ear.
Beep… Beep… Beep…
Each ring stretched into eternity, her breath catching in her throat. The anticipation was suffocating.
“Hello, you’ve reached the receiver’s voice mailbox. Please leave a message or try again later…”
The flat, automated voice hit Sadie like a punch to the gut. Her heart plummeted, the glimmer of hope she had clung to dimming like a candle in the wind.
No answer.

###Chapter 390:
She stared blankly at the screen for a second before stubbornly redialing. But the result was the same. Her grip slackened, and the phone slipped from her hand, landing on her lap with a soft thud.
Could it be… another dead end?
No. She refused to believe this was it.
She had spent years searching, hoping. She wouldn’t stop now. Her mother was out there. And she was going to find her. No matter what it took.
Sadie pushed open the door to her studio, and the familiar scents of leather and fabric enveloped her.
Her steps were heavy, as though she were trudging through mud, her body both light and burdened by an unseen weight.
Inside, Nanette was engrossed in her laptop, managing orders. She glanced up at the sound of the door, flashing a bright smile.
“You’re back, Sadie!”
But her smile faltered when she noticed Sadie’s ghastly pallor. Even her lips were drained of color.
Sadie nodded stiffly, wordlessly making her way to her office where she slumped into her chair, overcome with fatigue.
Nanette set aside her work and approached with a worried frown.
“What’s wrong, Sadie? You don’t look well.”
Sadie’s eyes settled on the design drafts scattered across her desk. Her voice was a hoarse whisper.
“I’m okay.”
“Okay?” Nanette’s skepticism was evident. “You’re ashen. You can’t be okay. Are you pushing yourself too hard? Maybe you need a break.”

Sadie shook her head, too overwhelmed to articulate her feelings.
The unanswered calls loomed large, constricting her breathing. Her mother had always been a deep, unresolved ache in her life, a longing that persisted despite the years. She had finally come close to a breakthrough in her search, only for it to elude her grasp once more.
The weight of her crushed hopes was nearly suffocating.
As Nanette observed Sadie’s forlorn look, her voice shook with emotion.
“Sadie, please, tell me what’s happening. I’m really worried about you.”
Gathering a shred of composure, Sadie said, “I met someone today who had news about… about my mom.”
“Your mom?” Nanette was taken aback.
Sadie nodded, her eyes quickly filling with tears.
“I found a lead, a phone number. I thought… I thought this time…” Her voice faded. She was unable to continue.
Nanette gently patted her shoulder, offering silent comfort.
Sadie picked up her phone, her hand shaking as she pointed to the phone number on the screen. “I called, but… but there was no answer…” Her voice dwindled into a whisper, then a sob.
Witnessing her distress, Nanette felt a deep sympathy. “Don’t lose heart, Sadie. Perhaps they were just unavailable?” She tried to console Sadie.noveldrama
“No, it can’t be that simple,” Sadie muttered, tears streaming down her face. “All these years, every lead I followed… I thought it was finally the right one, but… but it always ended in disappointment.”
She buried her face in her hands, her shoulders quaking with each sob.
The studio fell quiet, with only Sadie’s stifled cries echoing in the air.

###Chapter 391:
Nanette remained beside her, feeling helpless but present.
Eventually, Sadie’s sobs subsided. She wiped away her tears, her face set with resolve.
“I can’t give up. I must find her.”
Nanette’s expression softened with admiration. “Sadie, I believe you will.”
Sadie nodded, returning her attention to the design drafts on her desk, her determination clear. She couldn’t afford to be swallowed by grief; she had too much to achieve.
Picking up a pen, she began to draw.
“Nanette,” she said suddenly, looking up. “Could you help me trace this number?”
Nanette nodded, her response immediate. “I’ll do it right away,” she promised, then left the office.
One hour passed, and Sadie remained distracted, until a knock at the door pierced the silence. Nanette entered.
“I found it, Sadie,” she said. “It’s a number from Slimron.”
Sadie felt a sudden drop in her heart.
“Is there any more information?” Her voice was a hoarse whisper, barely audible.
Nanette shook her head. “I’m sorry, Sadie, just the location.”
Sadie slumped into her chair, overwhelmed by a sense of defeat.noveldrama
The greater the hope, the sharper the disappointment.
How many times had she felt this hope surge, only to be crushed?
In her quest to find her mother, she was reaching her breaking point.
“Sadie…” Nanette’s voice was tinged with sympathy.

After a long pause, Sadie looked up, her eyes red and swollen. “I need to go to Slimron.”
“Now?” Nanette’s eyes widened in surprise.
Sadie nodded. “Yes, now.”
She couldn’t delay. Her heart pounded with resolve. She had to go to Slimron.
Returning to Myrtlewood Estate, she quickly packed a small suitcase with essential items and a few changes of clothes.
As she was about to step out, she took one last look at the empty villa. Noah had been away for a while.
She planned to make a quick trip and return within two days.
She grabbed her phone and texted Nanette. “I’m off to Slimron now. Please look after the studio.”
Without waiting for a reply, she left.
Night had fallen, and the city lights sparkled.
The airport terminal buzzed with activity, filled with the sounds of hurried travelers.
Dragging her suitcase, Sadie navigated through the crowd, her determination clear in her stride.
“Excuse me, ma’am. Do you need any help?” a uniformed airport staff member approached and asked.
Sadie shook her head. “That’s very kind of you. Thanks, but I’m okay.”
She proceeded directly to the check-in counter and completed her boarding procedures.
In the waiting lounge, Sadie found a secluded corner, took out her phone, and dialed the mysterious number again.
Still, there was no answer.

###Chapter 392:
Out of frustration, she tossed her phone back into her bag, closed her eyes, and inhaled deeply.
“Where are you, Mom?” she muttered under her breath.
The plane ascended smoothly, slicing through the clouds.
As she gazed out at the enveloping darkness of the night sky, Sadie’s thoughts churned relentlessly.
Hours later, the aircraft touched down at Slimron International Airport.
As Sadie stepped out of the airport, a brisk breeze welcomed her.
She wrapped her coat tighter around herself and flagged down a taxi. “To the Fairview Hotel, please,” she instructed the driver.
The taxi pulled up to the entrance of the Fairview Hotel. After paying the fare, Sadie heaved her suitcase into the grand lobby.
Chandeliers twinkled above like celestial bodies, and a delicate scent lingered in the air.
Approaching the front desk, she said, “I have a reservation under the name Sadie Hudson.”
The receptionist offered a professional smile and began checking the system, but her expression slowly changed.
“Miss Hudson, I’m terribly sorry, but there’s a problem with your room.”
Sadie’s brow furrowed. “What problem?” She had confirmed earlier that everything was in order.
The receptionist appeared uneasy as she explained, “The hotel has been fully booked by a VIP tonight, and we are unable to accommodate other guests.”
Sadie was stunned. “Fully booked? But I have a confirmed reservation.”
At such a late hour, where could she possibly find another hotel room?

“I deeply apologize, Miss Hudson.” The receptionist’s tone was apologetic. “The VIP made a last-minute decision, and it has put us in a very difficult position…”noveldrama
Taking a deep breath to calm her mounting irritation, Sadie responded firmly, “I don’t care who the VIP is. I expect my room to be available as I have already paid for it.”
The receptionist nervously wrung her hands, her eyes darting around. “Miss Hudson, perhaps we could arrange for you to stay at a nearby hotel, and we’ll cover the cost…”
“No,” Sadie replied firmly. “I need to stay in this hotel. I have critical engagements tomorrow and relocating is not an option.”
At that moment, a man dressed in a perfectly tailored suit with meticulously styled hair approached. He was the hotel manager.
Despite his apologetic smile, his voice conveyed firm authority. “Ma’am, I regret to inform you that the hotel is not accommodating any other guests tonight.”
Sadie met his gaze, her voice steady. “I reserved my room in advance. Why am I being denied my stay?”
The manager’s polite smile remained. “I apologize for the inconvenience, but this decision was made by the hotel owner, and unfortunately, we cannot override it.”
“Who is the hotel owner? I need to speak with them,” demanded Sadie, her frustration escalating.
The manager’s demeanor stayed calm. “I’m sorry, but the owner is not available to meet with guests at the moment.”
“Not available, or simply unwilling?” Sadie retorted sharply. “This is completely unacceptable! I will be filing a formal complaint.”
The manager’s expression did not change. “You are certainly within your rights to do so, but I must inform you that you will not be able to stay here tonight.”
As Sadie’s anger intensified, the manager added, “Please, let’s handle this without causing a disturbance.” 
.

###Chapter 393:
“A disturbance?” Sadie gestured toward the front desk. “I made a reservation in advance, and now I’m being told I can’t stay here. Isn’t that the real disturbance?”
As the standoff continued, the hotel’s revolving door turned slowly and a figure emerged.
The man was dressed in a custom-tailored dark gray suit, his appearance marked by deep-set eyes, a high nose bridge, and slightly pursed lips, exuding a sense of detached elegance.
It was Noah.
The hotel manager, noticing him, quickly approached with a deferential smile. “Mr. Wall, I apologize for this unfortunate scene. I’ll take care of it immediately.”
As he spoke, he cast a stern glance at Sadie and addressed the staff behind him.
“What are you doing, just standing there? Escort this lady out!”
Two staff members immediately stepped forward, each grabbing one of Sadie’s arms, and began to drag her out.
“What do you think you’re doing? Let go of me!” Sadie struggled with all she had, but she was no match for two burly men.
Noah’s brows furrowed, his gaze narrowed in confusion as he looked at Sadie.
“What are you doing here?”
Sadie froze at the sound of his voice. She even forgot to struggle. She hadn’t expected to run into Noah.
Before she could answer his question, the manager interjected. He addressed Noah with the utmost respect as he pointed at Sadie.
“Apologies, Mr. Wall. This young lady is causing a scene. She insists on staying at our hotel, but you have booked the entire place for the night. I have explained to her countless times that we are not accepting guests, but she wouldn’t take no for an answer. Her outburst is damaging the hotel’s reputation.”
Noah glanced back and forth between Sadie and the manager, his gaze deep and inscrutable.
Find magical tales on gα?ησν?s?c?
“Do you know this lady, Mr. Wall?” the manager asked carefully, trying to read the situation.
Noah fixed him with a cold glance and said in a calm but authoritative voice, “She is my wife.”
“You—Your wife?” the manager gasped, his voice rising sharply. His earlier arrogance was now replaced with shock and fear.
He had never considered that the woman he had branded as a troublemaker would turn out to be Noah Wall’s wife!
His knees buckled under him, and he collapsed on the floor. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead and back.
He had made a grave mistake—perhaps the worst mistake of all.
“M-Mrs. Wall! I am terribly sorry, Mrs. Wall. I—I had no idea…” the manager stammered in a trembling voice.noveldrama
Sadie gave him a look that was far from forgiving.
“Release Mrs. Wall right this instant!” the manager barked at the staff holding her. “You fools, are you blind? You didn’t even recognize Mrs. Wall!”
The two staff members quickly let Sadie go, their heads lowered with fear. They didn’t even have it in them to defend themselves.
The manager wiped the sweat from his forehead and bowed in front of Sadie.
“Please accept my sincerest apologies, Mrs. Wall. I was blind and failed to recognize your status. I implore you to be the bigger person and forgive me, just this once.”
Sadie continued to look at him without saying anything.
A few seconds passed, and the manager became more anxious. He turned to direct his pleas to Noah. 
.

###Chapter 394:
“Mr. Wall, I really didn’t mean to—”
“You’re fired,” Noah said without ceremony.
“What?” The color drained from the manager’s face as he gaped at Noah in disbelief.
Seeing that he made no move to leave, Noah barked, “Get out!”
That snapped the manager back to his senses. All things considered, getting fired was as good as getting a second shot at life. He scrambled out of the building in a panic. The two staff members followed suit and also fled.
Only Noah and Sadie remained in the now quiet lobby.
Noah slowly approached Sadie, his eyes never leaving her face.
“Why are you here?”
His tone was gentle and carried a subtle hint of concern.
Sadie took a deep breath and looked up to meet Noah’s gaze, unsure of what she was feeling at the moment.
“I…” Sadie began, only to realize that she didn’t know what to say.
Noah didn’t rush her, though. He simply stood there and waited for her to find her bearings.
“I came to look for my mother,” Sadie finally said, her voice choked with emotion.
A flicker of surprise appeared in Noah’s eyes. He placed a hand on Sadie’s shoulder and squeezed it lightly.
“Take your time. Tell me what happened.”
Sadie took another deep breath to calm herself.
Then she recounted the investigation on her mother’s whereabouts that had led her to Slimron and this hotel.

The more Noah listened, the more serious his expression became.
“This string of beads belonged to my mother,” Sadie said. “According to Mr. Duncan, a wealthy lady sold it to him. He gave me a number, which was registered in Slimron…”
“Come on. You should get some rest upstairs,” Noah said, his voice low but firm.
Sadie hesitated for a fraction of a second before allowing him to guide her. They stepped into the elevator together. As the doors slid shut, sealing them inside, the sounds of the bustling lobby faded into silence.
The small, enclosed space suddenly felt heavier, charged with an unspoken tension.
Sadie kept her gaze down, her fingers anxiously twisting the hem of her coat. The subtle pressure in her chest made her uneasy—whether from exhaustion or from Noah’s presence beside her, she wasn’t sure.
Noah studied her from the corner of his eye before shifting his attention to the changing numbers on the panel.
Then—ding!
The elevator reached the top floor and with a soft hum, the doors slid open.
The moment Noah stepped out, Samuel moved forward, prepared to deliver his report—but the words died on his tongue the instant he noticed Sadie following behind.
His expression stiffened, his usual efficiency faltering as his gaze flickered between them.
He parted his lips, grasping for the right words, but uncertainty clouded his thoughts.
In the end, all he managed were two words. “Mr. Wall…”
Noah nodded slightly, his tone composed, as if nothing was amiss. “Is the room ready?”
Samuel blinked, snapping back into focus. “Ah… Yes. It’s prepared. The presidential suite.”

###Chapter 395:
His words came instinctively, though his mind still reeled with silent questions. Why was Mrs. Wall here? And why did she look… lost?
Sadie, however, seemed oblivious to his scrutiny. Her head remained down, her posture distant, as if she were present in body but far away in thought.
Noah’s eyes swept over her, catching her discomfort. Without a word, he reached out, resting a hand gently on her shoulder.noveldrama
“Are you alright?”
The warmth of his touch startled Sadie. She forced a faint smile, willing herself to appear composed.
“I’m fine… just a little tired.”
Noah studied her for a moment before giving a small nod. “Alright.”
He didn’t press further, instead leading the way toward the suite.
Samuel stood motionless, watching them disappear down the hallway. His brows knitted together. Something was definitely off.
After a brief hesitation, he pulled out his phone, his fingers moving swiftly as he dialed a number.
“Breck, did you know Mrs. Wall is in Slimron?”
There was a pause on the other end. Then Breck, the ever-composed butler, spoke, a note of surprise in his tone. “Mrs. Wall is in Slimron? I wasn’t informed. And Mr. Wall… never mentioned it either.”
“I just found out myself,” Samuel murmured, lowering his voice. “She returned to the hotel with Mr. Wall, but… something seems off. She doesn’t look well. Like something happened.”
“I see…” Breck’s voice carried a note of contemplation. “I’ll keep an eye on things. You should do the same. Report anything unusual to me.”
“Understood.” Samuel ended the call, his mind now a storm of questions with no clear answers.

Inside the presidential suite, luxury exuded from every corner—elegance without excess, refinement in every detail.
The soft glow of the city lights spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows as Sadie sat motionless on the plush sofa, her gaze drifting over the glittering skyline, though she wasn’t truly seeing any of it. Her thoughts were far away.
Noah had poured a glass of water and stepped toward her before extending it.
“Drink.”
Sadie took the glass, sipping lightly, but the dryness in her throat remained.
“Thank you,” she murmured, her fingers tightening briefly around the cool glass. Then she asked, her voice slow and hoarse, “What brings you to… Slimron?” She didn’t look at Noah, her gaze anchored to the glass in her hands, as if bracing for an answer she wasn’t sure she wanted to hear.
Across from her, Noah settled into an armchair, his movements composed and deliberate. His long legs crossed, exuding a quiet, effortless authority.
For a moment, he said nothing. Then finally, he answered.
“I have matters to handle here.” Simple. Direct. Impenetrable.
Yet the weight of those words settled heavily in Sadie’s chest.
She lowered her lashes, exhaling softly.
“I see.”
And with that, silence reclaimed the space between them.
Noah watched her, his gaze unreadable. The way Sadie sat there, her posture weighed down by an invisible burden, stirred something deep inside him. He knew she had questions. He knew she was searching for something—answers that had eluded her for too long.

###Chapter 396:
Yet the truth… he couldn’t give it to her.
Not yet.
“About your mother…” His voice wavered slightly before steadying. “I’ll help you uncover the truth.”
Sadie stiffened. Her head snapped up, eyes wide, searching his face for sincerity.
“Really?”
Noah met her gaze without hesitation.
“Yes.” His tone was resolute, unwavering. “I’ll do my best.”
She fought back her tears, biting her lower lip as she struggled to steady her trembling voice.
“Thank you.”
Noah’s expression remained composed, but there was a quiet warmth beneath his words.
“You don’t need to thank me. I am your husband. Just get some rest and let me handle the rest.”
His promise settled over Sadie like a soothing balm, chasing away the darkness that had clung to her heart for so long.
With the Wall family’s influence behind her, the possibility of finding her mother was no longer just a fragile hope.
For the first time in what felt like forever, her tense nerves began to loosen. A deep exhaustion washed over her, heavier than she had anticipated.
Sadie curled up on the sofa and, without realizing it, fell asleep.
As the night deepened, silence enveloped the room, punctuated only by the occasional honk of a distant car.
Noah finished handling some emails and glanced over at Sadie, who was sleeping soundly on the sofa. Her long eyelashes cast delicate shadows over her cheeks, and the soft lighting highlighted her gentle features.
Quietly, he stood, walked over, and carefully lifted her from the sofa. After tucking her in, he sat by the bedside, watching her sleep. A faint crease marred her serene expression, hinting at her inner turmoil.
He reached out, gently brushing her cheek with the back of his fingers, marveling at the softness of her skin.
“Mmm…” Sadie murmured, stirring slightly in her sleep.
Noah withdrew his hand and left the bedroom, heading to the study where he dialed Samuel’s number.
“Look into the whereabouts of Sadie’s mother. I need it as soon as possible,” he instructed in a low, firm tone.
“Yes, Mr. Wall,” came Samuel’s respectful response.
“Mmm…” Sadie murmured, slowly awakening.
Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting patterns on the floor and awakening her fully.
She blinked away the remnants of sleep and looked around, realizing Noah was no longer in the room. The suite felt large and empty, intensifying the loneliness enveloping her.
A pang of loss hit her as she rose from the bed, walked to the window, and drew back the curtains. The morning sun flooded the room, brightening every corner.
Outside, the city buzzed with life, its tall buildings and bustling streets a stark contrast to the emptiness she felt inside.
Turning away, she noticed her bag on the sofa. As she moved to pick it up, a note caught her eye. It lay on the coffee table, an address scribbled on it along with the words: 
.

.noveldrama
###Chapter 397:
“Your mother once lived here.”
Her heart leaped, a mix of hope and excitement coursing through her. She gripped the note tightly, took a deep breath, and attempted to steady her emotions.
Eager for answers, she quickly dialed Noah’s number.
The phone rang endlessly, but there was no answer.
Refusing to be deterred, she tried again, but still, no response came.
Uncertain of Noah’s whereabouts or when he might return, she felt a deep resolve to take the next steps on her own. She knew she had to find her mother urgently.
Grabbing her bag, Sadie quickly left the hotel and hailed a cab, giving the driver the address on the note.
Throughout the journey, a blend of anxiety and anticipation churned within her. She clung to the hope of finding her mother, yet feared another disappointment.
After about an hour’s drive, the cab stopped at the entrance of an old neighborhood.
Sadie paid the driver, stepped out, and took a deep breath before walking into the dilapidated area.
The buildings were run-down, with peeling paint and trash strewn about. The air carried a damp, musty smell that was nearly suffocating.
She located the building from the address and ascended the crumbling stairs. Her heart raced with each step, nearly out of control.
Upon reaching the third floor, she paused before a closed door. After hesitating, she knocked gently.
The sound echoed down the silent hallway.
After a long pause, the door creaked open.
Your favorite stories are on g?lnσνes?c?m
An elderly woman with graying hair peered out, looking alarmed.
“Excuse me, I…” Sadie began cautiously.
The woman examined her intently before responding, “Who are you looking for?”
“I’m looking for…” Sadie paused, took a deep breath, and continued, “My mother, Jean Hudson.”
The woman’s face flickered with surprise.
“Your mother?” she echoed, her voice laced with skepticism.
“Yes,” Sadie affirmed, her eyes brimming with hope.
The woman fell silent for a moment, then delivered the disheartening news.
“Your mother no longer lives here.”
Sadie felt her heart drop, a tide of disappointment sweeping over her.
“Do you know where she might have gone?” Sadie pressed, her voice tinged with desperation.
The woman shook her head. “I don’t know.”
Sadie’s eyes welled up with the threat of tears. She bit her lip, fighting back the emotion.
“Thank you,” she murmured softly, then turned to leave.
“Please wait,” the woman called out suddenly.
Sadie paused and looked back, puzzled.
The woman hesitated, then offered a glimmer of hope. “I don’t know where your mother went, but she used to frequent a certain place.”
Sadie’s eyes lit up. “Where is that place?” she asked eagerly.
The elderly lady responded, “A temple on the outskirts of the city.”
“A temple?” Sadie echoed, confused.
The elderly lady nodded. “Yes. Your mother often prayed there.” 
.

###Chapter 398:
Hope sparked within Sadie. She expressed her gratitude to the elderly woman and quickly departed from the area.
She flagged down a cab and directed it to the temple on the city’s edge.
As Sadie entered the temple, the air was dense with the aroma of incense, a ritualistic element of the temple’s practices. The scent permeated the ancient structure.
With each step toward the main hall, Sadie’s pulse raced.
She pushed the heavy wooden door open; a wave of sandalwood scent welcomed her. In the subdued light, the deities’ statues stood solemn and majestic.
“Excuse me. Have you seen this woman?” Sadie presented a photo of her mother to a monk mid-prayer.
The monk studied the photo, then slowly shook his head. “I’m sorry, but I have never seen this woman.”
Disappointment washed over Sadie, dousing her flicker of hope. Could her mother have vanished without a trace?
“However…” The monk hesitated, a memory surfacing. “A few years ago, a woman resembling her stayed here briefly. She left something behind.”
Hope sparked in Sadie’s eyes again. “What did she leave?”
The monk disappeared into the inner hall and returned with an old key. “This key. She mentioned it might be useful in the future.”
The key, cold and styled in an ancient design, lay heavy in Sadie’s hand. She turned it over, searching for clues yet finding none.noveldrama
Just then, her phone rang, shattering the temple’s serene silence.
It was Noah. “Sadie, where are you?” His voice was laced with urgency.
Stories live now on galnσ?o
“I’m at the temple on the outskirts,” Sadie replied, her voice slightly hoarse.
“I’ll pick you up,” Noah said, and then the call ended.
Standing at the temple entrance, Sadie gazed out at the distant mountains, her emotions swirling.
What secret did the key her mother had left behind hold?
A black Maybach soon pulled up. Noah stepped out and quickly approached Sadie.
“Did you find anything?” he asked, his voice full of concern.
“Just this,” Sadie said, handing him the key.
Noah took the key, examining it intently as his brows knitted together.
“Let’s get in the car first,” he suggested.
He assisted Sadie into the vehicle and then got in himself.
As the car pulled away from the temple, Sadie looked back at the receding structure, her heart heavy with uncertainty.
Kyla, hidden in the shadows, watched the car disappear into the distance, her eyes flickering with a mix of jealousy and curiosity.
She hadn’t expected to run into Noah and Sadie in Slimron.
She clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms.
“Sadie, what is it about you that makes Noah care about you so deeply?” she muttered bitterly.
Inside the car, Noah held the aged key, deep in thought.
The design of the key was oddly familiar.
“This key looks a lot like the one from a pendant my grandmother used to wear,” he remarked suddenly. “But that pendant has long been missing.”
Sadie’s heart raced. Could this key have ties to the Wall family?
“Your grandmother?” she inquired, her voice tinged with curiosity. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 399:
Noah nodded. “Yes. My grandmother spent some time in Slimron when she was young. For reasons unknown, she left and never came back here.”
A daring hypothesis sparked in Sadie’s mind.
Could there be a connection between her mother and Noah’s grandmother?
The thought stunned her.
If her speculation held any truth, the mysteries surrounding her mother’s disappearance and the enigmatic key might be related to the Wall family.
She glanced at Noah, wanting to delve deeper but hesitant about where to start.
Noah then took her to a quaintly decorated restaurant.
“Try this,” he suggested softly, placing a piece of roasted rib on her plate.
Distracted, Sadie nibbled on the rib, her mind preoccupied with the key.
“What’s wrong?” Noah noticed her absent gaze and expressed his concern.
“Just a bit tired,” Sadie replied, offering a forced smile to mask her deep thoughts.
Noah didn’t push the issue, instead quietly pouring her a cup of coffee.
The remainder of their meal passed in silence.
Later that evening, when they arrived back at the Fairview Hotel, the lobby was brightly lit, the polished marble floors gleaming under the lights.
As they entered, the new hotel manager quickly recognized Noah and approached with deference, bowing slightly.
“Good evening, Mr. Wall.”
“Hmm.” Noah acknowledged the manager with a slight nod, his tone indifferent.
“Mr. Wall.” The manager hesitated before continuing. “There’s a lady here claiming to be your friend who wants to see you.”noveldrama
Explore captivating tales on gα ? ησ ν s?com
“A lady?” Noah’s brow furrowed slightly. “Who is she?”
“She said her surname is Wade.” The manager watched Noah’s reaction carefully.
Wade?
Kyla immediately came to Noah’s mind.
Why was she here?
Noah glanced at Sadie, catching her uneasy expression.
Kyla had always been a cause of tension between them. Why had she suddenly appeared now?
“Let her come to the top floor,” Noah instructed calmly.
The manager nodded quickly and departed.
Sadie stood, feeling a wave of discomfort, her palms sweaty.
Moments later, the elevator doors on the top floor parted, and Kyla stepped out gracefully.
She was dressed in a striking red gown, her appearance meticulously put together, radiating allure.
“Noah.” Her voice was soft and enticing as she approached.
Noah nodded slightly, maintaining a neutral tone. “Why are you here?”
“I came to see you,” Kyla replied, her gaze shifting to Sadie, scanning her with an almost imperceptible edge of hostility.
Sadie tightened her grip on her bag, trying to appear composed.
“Noah, I know I’ve made many mistakes,” Kyla said, looking at Noah with a pleading expression. “I truly regret them. Can you forgive me?”
Her eyes brimmed with tears, poised to spill.
Sadie’s breathing became labored. 
.

###Chapter 400:
She felt like an outsider, witnessing the scene unfold with a storm of emotions.
“Let bygones be bygones,” Noah responded flatly, showing no emotion.
Kyla seized on his words as if they were a lifeline.
She turned to Sadie with an inquisitive look. “Sadie, you… don’t mind, do you?”
Caught off guard by Kyla’s direct address, Sadie took a deep breath to steady her voice.
“I…”
She clenched her fists, her nails pressing into her palms. As she struggled to maintain her composure, her voice wavered slightly.
“Thank you, Mr. Wall, for your kindness. I won’t impose any longer.”
A flicker of triumph passed through Kyla’s eyes, quickly masked by a feigned look of concern.
“Sadie, what’s wrong? Did I say something to upset you? Please don’t misunderstand. I just…”
“There’s no misunderstanding,” Sadie interjected firmly.
She turned to Noah, managing a forced smile.
“Mr. Wall, I’ve booked my flight home for tonight. Averi’s educational trip will end soon, and I need to pick him up.”noveldrama
Noah’s expression tightened, a hint of displeasure crossing his features.
“Why rush back tonight? Tomorrow would be just as fine.”
“But I need to leave now,” Sadie insisted, her voice steady and resolute. “There are many things I need to handle.”
Staying any longer felt unbearable to her, each moment more suffocating than the last.
Kyla’s presence was like a thorn in her side, each breath sharpened with discomfort and pain.

Kyla reached out to gently grasp Noah’s arm, her eyes brimming with tears.
“Noah, is Sadie still upset with me? I know it’s my fault. I shouldn’t have…”
Noah, however, was focused on Sadie.
“I’ll go back with you.”
“No.” Sadie declined sharply. “I can manage on my own.”
She was eager to leave, to distance herself from the weight of the current situation.
“Sadie…” Noah began, but Sadie cut him off.
“Mr. Wall, please show some respect.” Her tone was icy.
Without another word, she turned and walked away, her steps brisk and determined.
Noah watched her leave, his face a complex mask of emotions, irritation bubbling beneath the surface.
Kyla, sensing an opportunity, leaned closer to him, her voice a whisper.
“Noah, don’t be upset with Sadie. It’s probably because of me…”
“Enough!” Noah snapped, pushing her away abruptly. His voice was icy as he added, “Don’t mention this again.”
He then turned and walked away, leaving Kyla alone, her expression one of shocked pallor.
Back in her room, Sadie quickly gathered her belongings, her mind set on leaving without delay.
She called Nanette.
“Nanette, please book me a flight home tonight. Thanks.”
“What happened, Sadie? You don’t sound like yourself.” Nanette expressed her concern.
“It’s nothing. I just need to return earlier than planned,” Sadie replied, her tone strained as she fought back her emotions. “Averi’s vacation will begin soon, and I want to be there for him.”

Message from Noah:
I hope you’re enjoying the new chapters! More novels are on the way this week, so stay tuned to the website for updates.
I’m also working on a new section featuring VIP novels. This initiative is meant to help protect some of the website’s content, since a few sites have been copying everything I publish—even my messages.
In the near future, I’ll introduce a subscription model that will grant access to all these VIP novels. But don’t worry—free content will still be available. For example, if we release 10 novels, 6 will remain free while 4 will be VIP.
The idea behind the VIP novels is not only to prevent other websites from copying everything, but also to thank the people who support this project and help us keep the website running. I truly appreciate the kind messages you send me on WhatsApp and your constant support—thank you for being part of this community.
Lastly, my goal is to publish 1,000 novels, and I hope you, dear reader, will continue to enjoy this website along the way. God loves you, and Noah wishes you all the best. (=?=)/

###Chapter 401:
“Alright, I’ll handle it right away,” Nanette reassured her, setting to work immediately.
After the call, Sadie sank into the sofa, her energy drained, feeling utterly exhausted.
Sadie had thought that these past few days had meant something, had changed something between her and Noah.
Now, it was painfully clear that it was all just her one-sided fantasy.
She stood up and walked out of the hotel with her luggage. Not once did she glance back.
In front of the hotel, Samuel bowed his head slightly and opened the car door for her.
“Are you all right, Mrs. Wall?”
“I’m fine,” Sadie said with a forced smile as she got into the back seat.
Sadie looked out the window as the vehicle slowly pulled away, her heart roiling with confusion and unease.
“Mr. Wall, Mrs. Wall has left,” Samuel reported from behind Noah. Although his tone was respectful as always, he couldn’t help the touch of doubt and hesitation that came with it.
Noah spun around abruptly, panic flashing across his eyes before disappearing the next second. His lips pressed into a thin line, his jaw clenching as he gritted his teeth.
“When?” he rasped.
“Just a few minutes ago.” Samuel cautiously studied Noah’s expression before adding, “Mrs. Wall seemed upset. She… she left in quite a hurry.”
A long, tense silence followed.
L?tτ чh?ρτ?r? ιn gɑlοv?l?.сo
Noah raked a hand through his hair and walked over to the floor-to-ceiling window on one side of the room.noveldrama
“Some respect,” he muttered under his breath, a wave of frustration rising in his chest.
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath in a bid to clear his mind, but his efforts were futile.
When he finally opened his eyes a couple of moments later, he was still far from calm.
“Arrange for someone to tail and protect her. Make sure they’re discreet.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall.”
With that, Samuel exited the room, gently closing the door behind him.
Sadie’s flight was smooth and uneventful. As she prepared to deplane, she unbuckled her seatbelt and kneaded her throbbing temples.
The trip had left her exhausted, both physically and mentally. All she wanted was to return to her studio and get some much-needed rest.
Suddenly, her phone vibrated inside her pocket—Nanette was calling.
“Have you landed, Sadie? Something big has happened!” Nanette’s voice was urgent, and the words spilled out of her in rapid-fire succession.
A sense of foreboding came over Sadie. “What happened?”
“Our system… well, it looks like we had a glitch or something. We have no idea how it happened, but your name was registered for the International Jewelry Design Competition somehow.”
Sadie’s breath hitched. The International Jewelry Design Competition?
It wasn’t her—she hadn’t signed up for it at all. And the computers in the studio had just been recently serviced. They were clean and protected. How could they have a sudden glitch out of nowhere?
“What did you just say? How did this happen?” Sadie tried to stay calm. “How’s the system now? Does it function normally?”
“As far as I can tell, everything is back to normal, but the registration has been submitted successfully. There’s no way we can withdraw your name.”
Nanette sounded like she was about to cry. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 402:
“Sadie, what should we do? The International Jewelry Design Competition is no joke. There’s a lot you will have to prepare. And we just took on the Lawrence Group’s project for this quarter, too! We don’t have the time or the resources to spare for this competition.”
Sadie took a deep breath, still telling herself to remain calm.
Participating in the International Jewelry Design Competition wasn’t a big deal in itself, but current circumstances at her studio did not allow for it.
The Lawrence Group’s project was a crucial endeavor, and any delay, regardless of the reasons, could have dire repercussions for their business.
“All right, I understand. Don’t worry, Nanette. I’ll be back at the studio soon. We’ll figure out what to do, okay?”
Despite her words, Sadie felt as though her heart had been tossed into an abyss by the time she ended the call.
The system’s mysterious glitch, the sudden registration for the International Jewelry Design Competition—no matter which way she looked at it, the timing was very suspicious.
Soon, another call came in. When Sadie glanced at her screen, the caller ID displayed Vivi’s name.
Sadie had barely picked up when Vivi’s shrill voice immediately came through.
“So, I heard you signed up for the International Jewelry Design Competition. You’re really trying to compete with me, aren’t you, Sadie?”
Sadie scoffed, her lips curling into a sneer. Just as she had thought—it was all Vivi’s doing.
“Vivi, let’s cut to the chase, shall we? Did you do this?”
“Yes, it was me,” Vivi replied smugly. “What are you going to do about it?”
g?lnσν?s﹒, the heart of fiction
“Sadie, I’ve always wanted to surpass you. This International Jewelry Design Competition is our final showdown! I’ll prove I’m the true queen of design!” Vivi declared.
“Vivi, you’re so childish!” Sadie managed to suppress her anger. “Even if you resorted to underhanded tactics to drag me into this competition, it doesn’t change the fact that you’re not as skilled as I am!”
“Oh, really? Then let’s see who comes out on top!” Vivi retorted, ending the call abruptly.
Sadie clenched her phone, her grip tightening in frustration.noveldrama
Vivi’s challenge had ignited a fiery anger within her, yet she recognized that impulsiveness would not serve her well now.
She needed to remain composed and strategize effectively.
Upon leaving the airport, she hailed a cab and directed the driver to her studio. During the ride, Sadie mulled over her plans.
The International Jewelry Design Competition and her partnership with the Lawrence Group were both pivotal. She needed a solid plan to excel in both arenas.
“Sir, please hurry,” Sadie implored, her anxiety evident.
The cab driver noticed her tense expression in the rearview mirror and accelerated quietly.
Trying to gather her thoughts, Sadie leaned back, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath to calm herself.
When the cab arrived at her studio, Sadie quickly exited.
The studio door was slightly open, light pouring out onto the sidewalk. She pushed the door open and was immediately met by the sight of Nanette pacing anxiously.
The studio was in chaos, with design drafts strewn about, fabrics and tools cluttering the tables, and a palpable tension filling the air.
“Sadie, you’re back!” Nanette exclaimed, her relief evident as she approached like she had found a lifeline. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 403:
“What’s the current situation?” Sadie asked, striving to keep her voice steady despite her urgency.
“It’s the same. We can’t cancel the registration!” Nanette responded, close to tears. “We don’t even have time to prepare for the International Jewelry Design Competition, and we haven’t even completed the first draft for our partnership with the Lawrence Group!”
She gestured to the scattered design drafts, her voice laden with despair. “Look at this mess. All these were preparations for the partnership, and now everything’s in disarray!”
Sadie surveyed the studio, noting the chaos—a testament to the stress Nanette had been under.
Approaching a table, Sadie picked up a few drafts and studied them carefully.
“These designs are quite innovative. You’ve clearly been working hard on them,” she said, her voice softening as she sought to comfort Nanette.
“But there’s no time to refine them now!” Nanette’s voice broke slightly. “The International Jewelry Design Competition is just a month away. We’re not going to be ready!”
Sadie set the drafts back down, inhaled deeply, and fixed Nanette with a determined gaze.
“We’ll tackle both challenges together. We’ll manage both the partnership project and the International Jewelry Design Competition,” Sadie declared.
“Both?” Nanette looked at her, incredulous.
“How can that be feasible? There are only three of us, and we have just one month to complete two major projects. It’s impossible!”
Sadie stepped closer, placing her hands reassuringly on Nanette’s shoulders.
“Nothing is impossible. Nanette, trust in me and in yourself. We’ve pulled through countless challenges and all-nighters together. We can do this too.”

Seeing the resolve in Sadie’s eyes, Nanette let her panic ebb away. She nodded firmly, wiped away her tears, and her voice steadied.
“Alright. We’ll tackle both projects! If we need to, we’ll pull a few more all-nighters!”
A faint smile appeared on Sadie’s lips, a bright spot in the cluttered studio.
“First, let’s reorganize our schedule.”
Sadie grabbed a pen and a blank sheet of paper and began quickly outlining a plan.
“We need to complete the first draft for the partnership with the Lawrence Group within two weeks. Then we can make revisions and improvements. The last two weeks will be dedicated entirely to preparing for the International Jewelry Design Competition.”
Nanette joined her at the table, her brows furrowing as she took in the ambitious schedule Sadie was sketching out.
“Two weeks for the first draft? That’s incredibly tight!”
“I know it’s a tight schedule, but we have to make it work. We need to maximize every minute, enhance our efficiency, and ensure we work seamlessly as a team.”noveldrama
“Alright!” Nanette agreed, her resolve renewed.
With renewed vigor, Sadie and Nanette began to organize the scattered design drafts, sorting them according to the respective projects.
As they worked, they discussed their immediate next steps, the studio buzzing with a blend of tension and the dynamic energy of urgent work.
Time marched on relentlessly, each tick of the clock urging them forward.
Sadie pushed open the grand doors of Myrtlewood Estate and was immediately enveloped by its familiar warmth.
The tension from the studio began to dissolve, replaced by a comforting sense of relief. She slipped into her slippers and casually placed her bag on the entryway cabinet.

###Chapter 404:
“Mom!” A crisp voice echoed from the living room, followed by the sound of small feet rushing toward her.
Averi, her beloved son, had just returned from his study trip in Slimron.
“Sweetheart, I missed you so much!” Sadie enveloped Averi in a tight hug, planting a kiss on his soft hair.
“Mom, I missed you too!” Averi looked up with bright, joyful eyes. “Slimron was so much fun. Let me tell you all about it…”
Averi grabbed Sadie’s hand, his excitement palpable as he began to recount his adventures.
“We went to the aquarium and saw so many fish, and dolphins that danced…”
Averi’s hands fluttered as he mimicked the dolphins, his enthusiasm infectious. As Sadie watched her son’s animated expressions, her heart swelled with affection.
The stress of the studio and Vivi’s provocations faded into the background, replaced by the simple joy of being with her son.
“And we also visited the science museum where they had amazing robots…” Averi continued, barely pausing for breath.
Sadie listened intently, interjecting with questions and reveling in his excitement.
The delight in Averi’s voice and the sparkle in his eyes filled her with profound happiness and contentment.
“Mom, guess what? I made a new friend named Leon Powell. We played games and did experiments together.”
Averi beamed as he produced a photo from his pocket.
The picture showed two little boys standing shoulder to shoulder, smiles wide. Seeing the photo, Sadie felt a warm surge of joy.
She was thrilled that Averi had made a new friend and experienced such enriching adventures.

“Mom, can you come with me to Slimron next time? We can visit the aquarium, the science museum, and more!” Averi pleaded, tugging at her hand.
“I promise, sweetheart. Once things settle down, we’ll go together, okay?” Sadie stroked Averi’s hair, her voice soft with a touch of apology.
“Okay!” Averi exclaimed, leaping up to give Sadie a big, joyful hug.
Sadie hugged her son tightly, her heart swelling with love. She knew she had to surmount all challenges for Averi’s sake and win this battle.
“Mom, I’m so hungry!” Averi complained, rubbing his tummy and giving her a pitiful look.
“Alright, let’s get something to eat,” Sadie replied, taking Averi’s hand and leading him to the kitchen.
“Could you please prepare dinner for us?” Sadie requested of the cook.noveldrama
The cook nodded and quickly set to work.
Sadie and Averi took their seats at the dining table, chatting happily as they awaited their meal.
Soon, the table was laden with an array of delicious dishes, the soft light from the crystal chandelier casting a warm glow over the elegant tableware.
Averi inhaled the enticing aromas, his eyes alight with excitement.
“Wow! It’s glazed chicken! I love glazed chicken the most!” Averi beamed, his hands ready to dive in.
Sadie laughed and gently chided him. “Wash your hands first, my little foodie.”
Averi hopped down and scampered to the bathroom.
The sound of running water filled the air as Sadie looked on, her heart filled with affection for her energetic little boy. 
.

.
###Chapter 405:
Once his hands were clean, Averi hurried back to the table, grabbed a fork, and eagerly took a bite of the glazed chicken.
“Mmm! So delicious!” Averi mumbled through his bites.
Sadie smiled warmly, watching her son eat with such gusto, her heart brimming with happiness and contentment.
“Mom, why doesn’t Mr. Wall join us for dinner today?” Averi suddenly asked, his voice tinged with curiosity.
Sadie’s smile wavered slightly, her grip on her fork tightening.
She paused, unsure how to explain Mr. Wall’s absence.
The atmosphere at the table shifted subtly.
Noticing the change, Breck discreetly exited, giving mother and son some privacy.
Sadie took a deep breath, striving to sound casual.
“He has important work at his company today, so he couldn’t make it for dinner.”
“Oh.” Averi nodded, his understanding apparent, and he returned his focus to his meal.
Sadie observed her thoughtful son, feeling a twinge of sadness in her heart.
As the night deepened, the estate quieted down.
Lying in her bed, Sadie drifted in and out of sleep.
Moonlight streamed through the curtains, casting soft shadows across the room.
Suddenly, the piercing ring of the phone broke the silence, startling Sadie awake.
She reached for her phone, noting it was from Wall Manor’s landline.
“Hello?” she answered, her voice still coated with sleepiness.
g?lnσν?s?com, the heart of storytelling
“Good evening, Mrs. Wall. This is Gabriel from Wall Manor,” the voice on the other end said respectfully. “Mr. Nigel Wall would like to invite you to lunch at Cloudridge Estate next Monday.”noveldrama
Perched on the city’s edge, Cloudridge Estate belonged to the Wall family. Nestled against the mountains, it offered tranquility and breathtaking scenery. A faint unease began to stir within Sadie’s heart.
She responded with composure, “Got it. Please inform Nigel that I will arrive on time.”
“Very well,” said Gabriel, then disconnected the call.
Placing her phone down, Sadie inhaled deeply.
The unexpected invite from Nigel threw her for a loop, filling her with a tension she couldn’t quite shake.
Turning her gaze, she saw Averi, who lay peacefully sleeping next to her, his features relaxed into a contented smile.
Her hand gently stroked his cheek, and warmth flooded her heart.
“I love you, Averi,” she whispered, as though to reinforce her resolve.
Seeing that Averi was deep in sleep, Sadie rose and made her way to the study.
Dim light washed over the desk, highlighting the fatigue on her face.
Opening her laptop, she started working.
As minutes morphed into hours, Sadie remained absorbed in her tasks, seeking to alleviate her discomfort through diligence.
Frustration mounting, she stood and went to fetch a glass of water.
Accidentally, her hand brushed a file folder on the desk’s edge.
As the folder tumbled to the floor, papers flew out.
As she kneeled to gather the papers, her eyes landed on a photo.
Displayed was a black sedan, its license plate indistinct. A crease formed on her brow, suspicion stirring within her.

###Chapter 406:
What could this be?
She continued to sift through the documents, encountering more photos and reports.
Among them, she uncovered the specifics of a vehicular accident, including the driver’s identity and screenshots from the surveillance footage at the scene.
Sadie’s heart raced, her breath catching.
“Ryder…” she whispered, staring at the driver’s name.
The name Ryder sparked an intense reaction.
Three years earlier, she had been the victim of a hit-and-run, leaving her comatose for an extended period.
She had longed to uncover the identity of the driver and their reason for fleeing.
Now, the answer was right in front of her.
Ryder had been behind the wheel during her traumatic accident.
These were evidently the fruits of Noah’s investigation.
Had Noah been investigating this since she left three years ago?
Overwhelmed by her findings, Sadie felt a surge of complex emotions.
Caught in this whirl of feelings, she found herself bewildered.
She carefully returned the documents to the folder and placed it back where it belonged.
She returned to her desk but found concentrating on work impossible. What drove Noah to dig into this case? Was he doing it for her, or was there something else at play?
Her mind buzzed with endless questions, creating a chaotic whirl of thoughts. The computer screen’s glow illuminated Sadie’s weary face.
Rubbing her tired eyes, she tried to refocus, yet her thoughts kept returning to the folder, to that name—Ryder.
Iè$? ￠t?€я? 1n lπoνεl?.c
Overcome by fatigue, she eventually drifted off to sleep at her desk.
In her half-asleep state, she felt someone lift her gently; the familiar scent of cologne enveloped her, comforting and warm.
The next morning, when Sadie awoke, she found herself lying in bed under a light blanket.noveldrama
Just then, Breck came in with breakfast.
“Thank you for last night,” she said, assuming it was Breck who had carried her back to her room and covered her with the blanket.
Breck wore a puzzled expression and asked, “Mrs. Wall, what did you say?”
Sadie responded, “I was thanking you for carrying me back to my room.”
Breck’s confusion deepened. “I haven’t done that, Mrs. Wall. I only arrived this morning.”
Sadie froze. If not Breck, then who?
Breck seemed to recall something and hurriedly said, “Ah, Mr. Wall came home last night.”
“He’s back?” Sadie asked, her voice laced with surprise.
“Yes, Mrs. Wall. Mr. Wall returned late last night. He must have seen you asleep in the study and carried you back to your room,” Breck explained.
Sadie felt a rush of warmth and comfort at the realization that it had been Noah, after all.
“Mr. Wall also mentioned that he would be back on time this evening for dinner with you and Averi,” Breck added.
Sadie was even more taken aback by this, and her fingers instinctively tightened around her coffee mug. Noah was coming back for dinner? 
.
.

###Chapter 407:
Confusion flickered at the back of her mind. Wasn’t Kyla in Slimron? Noah should be spending his time with her, shouldn’t he? Why would he come back?
Sadie bit her lower lip, her emotions all over the place.
“I see,” she muttered somewhat absentmindedly.
Downstairs, Averi’s cheerful laughter rang out, accompanied by the gentle, loving coos from Laura.
The sound did nothing to ease the confusion in Sadie’s heart, though.
“Mommy!” Averi exclaimed as he broke free from Laura’s embrace and came hurtling toward Sadie.
“Good morning, sweetheart.” Sadie mustered a smile and ruffled her son’s hair. After breakfast, Sadie drove to her studio. Her mind was still a tangled mess, even during the drive.
Noah’s actions left her lost and confused.
Just what on earth was that man thinking?
As soon as she settled behind her desk, Sadie immediately buried herself in work, just to escape her burgeoning thoughts.
Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a warm glow on the antique mahogany furniture of Wall Manor. A subtle hint of sandalwood permeated the air.
Kyla sat gracefully on the sofa in her cream-colored pantsuit, a cup of coffee in her hand as she engaged in pleasant conversation with Isabel.
“You’ve been looking much better recently, Isabel. The tonics are doing wonders on you,” Kyla remarked softly.
Isabel patted Kyla’s hand, her eyes filled with affection. “You’re always so considerate. You know exactly what I like. If only Noah were as attentive as you. I’ve been hearing a lot of rumors these past few days. How could Noah send you to Slimron?”
Kyla smiled slightly, but her mind was already making devious calculations. Isabel hadn’t said a single word when she was practically banished to Slimron, yet here she was, looking all worried and concerned.

“Noah is busy with work. He’s doing it for the sake of the Wall family, so I hope you can spare him some understanding.”
“That boy works too hard,” Isabel said with a sigh. “I was just about to go out, by the way. Why don’t you keep me company, Kyla?”
“Oh?” Kyla put her cup down. “Where are you going?”
Isabel hesitated for a moment before saying, “The paternity test results for Noah and that child are out. I’m planning to go and get the report.”
“Paternity test?” Kyla was visibly taken aback, and a keen sense of foreboding rose in her heart. Still, she maintained her composure. “You haven’t fully recovered yet, Isabel. Why don’t I go and get it for you?”
Isabel thought about it for a moment. She saw no harm in Kyla’s offer; if anything, it made sense. “All right, if you’re sure it’s not too much trouble. Be careful at the hospital, Kyla. It’s usually crowded this time of the day.”
“Don’t worry, Isabel. I’ll be careful.”
Kyla got the address from Isabel, her suspicions now running wild.
Before she left, Isabel retrieved a thermos from the kitchen. “I made this soup for Noah. Can you swing by the company and give it to him on your way?”
“Of course.” Kyla took the thermos, struggling to keep her smile from faltering.
Isabel nodded in satisfaction and saw her off at the door.
In her mind, Kyla was the ideal daughter-in-law. The young woman was gentle, cultured, and very considerate—a stark contrast to Sadie’s apparent lack of refinement. Kyla exited Wall Manor and got into her car, her smile giving way to a grim expression.
A paternity test report… noveldrama

###Chapter 408:
Her fingers clenched tightly around the note containing the hospital’s address. So, all this time, Isabel had been paying attention to that child.
Kyla started the engine and drove to the hospital. On the way, images of Sadie and Noah kept flashing in her mind, fueling the jealousy burning in the pit of her stomach.
Upon arriving at the hospital, Kyla sought out Dr. Arnold Gray.
“Excuse me, Dr. Gray,” Kyla said. “I was sent by Mrs. Wall to pick up a DNA report.”
Arnold adjusted his glasses. “Oh! Mr. Wall’s DNA report, right? Please wait here a moment.”
The man went to his file cabinet and took out a sealed envelope, which he handed over to Kyla.
Kyla’s heart raced, and her palms were sweaty as she took the envelope. She took a deep breath and told herself to calm down.
“Thank you,” she said to the doctor.
She could barely wait to see the file; she yanked the folder open the moment she stepped out of the hospital.
When she saw the results of the test, she felt her entire world shift. The ground beneath her feet seemed to disappear.
“The probability of paternity is 99.99%.”
The words echoed in her mind over and over.
She clutched the report so tightly that her fingernails almost tore through the paper. After a while, Kyla composed herself and returned the report to the folder. Once again, she forced herself to stay calm as she walked to her car and started the engine. She drove straight to the Wall Group building.
The Wall Group towered over most other skyscrapers, looking grand and imposing from every angle.
Kyla strode across the lobby, her high heels clacking loudly against the marble floor. She was carrying the thermos of soup Isabel had prepared especially for Noah.

“Miss Wade?” the receptionist called out in obvious surprise. “You’re back.” It caught the attention of the other employees nearby, and they soon cast curious glances in Kyla’s direction.
News of her transfer to Slimron had long since made the rounds within the company, so her sudden appearance was understandably causing a stir. Kyla mustered a faint smile and raised the thermos. “I’m here to see Noah.”
Everyone immediately understood, and they looked like they collectively sighed to themselves. Old flames were quite hard to extinguish, despite the missteps that might have occurred. To their minds, Noah still wasn’t able to let Kyla go.
And so, Kyla made her way to Noah’s office unimpeded. She knocked at the door.
“Come in,” came the deep, magnetic voice from inside.
Kyla pushed the door open and entered. Noah was sitting at his desk, his brows furrowed as he stared at his computer screen.
“Noah, I brought you some soup,” Kyla said softly, placing the thermos on the other side of his desk.
Noah looked up then. Something flashed across his eyes when they fell on Kyla, but it was gone in an instant. “What are you doing here?”
“Your mother asked me to bring you soup and check on you,” Kyla replied, sounding gentle and considerate as she stepped closer.
“How is she?” Noah inquired.
“She’s doing well, just worried you’re working too hard.” Kyla studied him for a few beats before cautiously asking, “Shall we have dinner together tonight?”
Noah pinned her with a deep, unreadable gaze. “This is your last chance, Kyla. If you cross the line again, don’t bother coming back.”

###Chapter 409:
Kyla froze, her smile turning stiff. “I understand.”
“Leave,” Noah commanded before turning his attention back to his computer. Biting her lower lip, Kyla turned away and left the office.
As soon as she was back inside her car, Kyla’s pleasant expression morphed into one of utter malice.
She took out the DNA report again. It must never reach Isabel, no matter what, or all her efforts would go to waste.
Kyla took out her phone and dialed a number. “I need you to forge a paternity test, and I want the results to show up negative.”
“No problem, Miss Wade,” a deep, male voice responded.
Kyla ended the call and proceeded to tear the DNA report into pieces. Then she rolled her window down and tossed the pieces out.
Just then, Samuel happened to be exiting the building. He instantly spotted Kyla’s car parked nearby, and was just in time to see her throw out paper scraps to the ground.
His curiosity was piqued, so he waited until she had driven away before going over. He picked up a handful of the scraps and was able to make out the words, “paternity test.”
A chill ran through Samuel. His instincts told him that something was not right. He didn’t waste any time and immediately called for security. “Collect all these scraps and bring them to my office.”
“Yes, Mr. Ford,” a security guard responded, already bending over to gather the paper scraps.
That afternoon, Kyla placed the forged paternity test report into a neat manila envelope. She couldn’t resist running her manicured nails over its flap as her lips curled into a triumphant smile.
Then she drove to Wall Manor.

Isabel was in the garden, pruning flowers. She beamed upon seeing the younger woman. “Kyla! Come here.”
“Isabel,” Kyla greeted politely before handing over the manila envelope. “This is… well…”
Puzzled, Isabel took the envelope and pulled out its contents. When she saw the words, “The alleged father is excluded as the biological father” at the bottom of the report, her face turned ashen. Then she dropped the garden shears she was holding, and they landed on the concrete footpath with a loud, metallic clang.
“How… How is this possible?” Isabel cried out in a trembling voice, her eyes wide with disbelief. She tried to read the report again and again, but the results did not change.
“Please don’t be too upset,” Kyla said, pretending to be concerned. “Here, take a seat first.”
Kyla helped Isabel sit down on a wicker chair and gently stroked the latter’s back. “Actually, I’ve been feeling like something was off for a while now.”
“Off? What do you mean?” Isabel clutched Kyla’s hand tightly.
Kyla bit her lower lip and pretended to debate with herself before saying, “Well, think about it. That child is almost three years old.”
Isabel blinked at her at first, until realization hit her. Then her eyes widened, and the color drained from her face. If the child was almost three years old, that meant Sadie had been pregnant with the boy three years ago!noveldrama
“That means when she was still with Noah, she—she got…” Isabel choked on her words and didn’t get to finish her sentence.
“It’s just a speculation on my part,” Kyla said quietly, lowering her head, though she looked like she had more to say on the matter.
“That disgrace of a woman!” Isabel shot to her feet, her entire body trembling with rage. “How dare she turn my son into a cuckold! How dare she!”
“Please calm down, Isabel,” Kyla said gently. “Our priority for now is to find a way to resolve this issue.”

###Chapter 410:
“Resolve the issue?! How in the world are we supposed to do that? Noah is completely under her spell. He won’t even listen to me!” Isabel slumped back into the chair, huffing in a mix of anger and helplessness.
“You have a point there. After all, Sadie is still staying at Myrtlewood Estate. Perhaps Noah is actually willing to raise another man’s child.” Kyla’s words were deliberate, and her goal was to provoke Isabel further.
“Myrtlewood Estate? That shameless bitch!” Sure enough, Isabel’s anger flared up again. “I can’t believe she still has the nerve to stay there after what she’s done! Let’s go there, right now!”
Isabel stormed off, and Kyla was only too eager to go with her.
It was a slow and peaceful afternoon at Myrtlewood Estate, and everything seemed to have lulled after the rush of midday activities.
An elderly woman with graying hair sat in the living room, her attention focused on the piece she was knitting. Laura was making a cozy new sweater for her adorable great-grandson in preparation for the coming winter.
The sudden, shrill ring of the doorbell disrupted the calm atmosphere in the villa. Breck went to open the door.
Before him stood two imposing women, each portraying a different picture of style and luxury. “Mrs. Wall, Miss Wade,” he greeted with a respectful bow.
Isabel ignored Breck, shoving past him to storm into the estate. Kyla was quick on her heels, a cunning smile playing on her lips.
The unexpected intrusion startled the servants, who retreated closer to the walls, as if to make themselves unseen.
“Get out, all of you!” Isabel suddenly yelled, her voice reverberating throughout the house. She then pointed at Breck and glared. “You, too!” Breck froze for a moment before lowering his head. “Yes, Mrs. Wall.”
He gestured at the other servants, taking them out of the villa with him, then closed the door behind him.

Isabel swept her gaze over the living room until it landed on Laura.
“Who are you?” Isabel demanded in a decidedly hostile tone.
Laura looked up, bewildered by the two women’s presence. “I’m sorry, who are you? Are you looking for Sadie? She’s not home at the moment.”
Kyla stepped forward and plastered a surprised expression on her face. “Oh, you must be Sadie’s grandmother.”
Laura nodded. “That’s right. Is there anything you need from Sadie?”
Kyla glanced at Isabel before turning to Laura with a look of pity. “Well, you may be unaware…”
“Of what?” Laura prodded when Kyla trailed off. She had no idea what was going on and had to put her knitting down.
Isabel suddenly let out a cold, humorless laugh. “Your granddaughter has no morals to speak of!”
Laura’s brows drew into a frown. “What are you talking about? Did something happen to Sadie?”
“You’re asking what happened?” Isabel shrieked. “Well, she cheated on her husband and gave birth to a bastard, and now she expects my son to raise the child!”
Laura was stunned. She couldn’t quite process what she was hearing.
“Cheated? What bastard? What are you saying? Do you mean that Sadie’s child…”
“What do you think?” Isabel spat out disdainfully. “That boy is the son of some nameless stranger!”
“Does she really believe she’s worthy of being part of our family? She ought to reflect on where she truly belongs!” noveldrama

###Chapter 411:
Laura’s complexion paled, her lips quivering. “You’re wrong! Sadie isn’t like that.”noveldrama
Isabel scoffed, unwilling to engage further with Laura. She turned sharply. “I came here solely to advise you to keep your granddaughter away from my son. She’s not fit for him.”
Kyla stayed behind as Isabel left. She approached Laura, her expression feigning concern. “Mrs. Stewart, try not to be too distressed. Actually, there’s something Sadie hasn’t told you. I just discovered it recently…”
“What are you implying?” Laura asked, her pulse quickening.
Kyla exhaled deeply. “You might not be aware, but Averi… he isn’t Noah’s son. He’s Sadie’s child with another man.”
Laura’s breathing intensified. She gripped the armrest of the sofa, her complexion turning ghostly.
Wasn’t Alex Averi’s father? Since when was he Noah’s son? What was happening? How could Sadie have done this?
“Consider this: Averi is nearly three years old. That means, three years ago, Sadie…” Kyla paused for effect, then added, “Noah and I share true love. Sadie is the other woman.”
“No… it can’t be…” Laura whispered, her vision blurring, her heart weighed down by sorrow.
“Are you all right, Mrs. Stewart?” Kyla asked, her tone laced with false concern as a glint of satisfaction flickered in her eyes.
Laura tried to respond, but words failed her. She leaned back slowly, falling onto the sofa.
“Mrs. Stewart! Mrs. Stewart!” Kyla shouted, pretending to be alarmed, yet she made no move to assist.
Laura eventually slumped onto the sofa, her face ashen, her breaths shallow. Meanwhile, in her studio, Sadie was engrossed in her laptop, her fingers dancing across the drawing tablet.

She was so focused that the world around her seemed to vanish, leaving only the design before her. Then, a sudden unease crept over her, causing her to furrow her brows in concern.
“What’s wrong, Sadie?” Nanette, noticing her unusual demeanor, asked with worry.
Sadie massaged her forehead. “It’s nothing, really. I’m just feeling a bit worn out.” She attempted to push aside the discomfort, trying to focus on her work, yet the feeling lingered, like a persistent sting in her heart.
Suddenly, her phone rang, piercing the quiet of the studio.
Sadie saw that it was from Myrtlewood Estate, and a chill ran through her.
“Hello?” she answered, her voice shaky.
“Mrs. Wall, your grandma… she suffered a heart attack, and we’ve rushed her to the hospital,” Breck said, his voice breaking with emotion.
“What?” Sadie’s head spun, as if struck by something hard. The tablet clattered to the floor from her grasp.
“My grandmother… what happened? How could this be?” Sadie stammered, her words barely holding together.
“Mrs. Stewart collapsed suddenly at home. You need to come quickly!” Breck urged.
Her vision blurred, but Sadie steadied herself against the desk, inhaling deeply to regain composure.
“Which hospital? I’m on my way,” she managed to say, her words deliberate.
After receiving the details, Sadie hung up, grabbed her coat, and rushed out.
“What happened, Sadie?” Nanette, alarmed by her friend’s ghostly pallor and frantic manner, asked, pressing for an explanation. 
.

.
###Chapter 412:
“My grandmother had a heart attack. I have to get to the hospital,” Sadie explained, hurrying.
“I’ll come with you.” Nanette offered immediately.
They quickly hailed a cab and sped toward the hospital.
In the cab, Sadie gripped her phone, her hands slick with perspiration.
Her thoughts raced, nearly overwhelming her.
Laura had been fine this morning. A heart attack? So sudden?
Was there an underlying cause?
She recalled that morning’s goodbye, with Laura contentedly knitting sweaters for her and Averi, her face warm with a tender smile. That image now pierced her heart sharply.
Throughout the journey, Sadie pleaded with the driver to hurry, desperate to get to the hospital as quickly as possible.
Upon arrival, Sadie and Nanette rushed toward the emergency room, asking for directions along the way.
Breck was pacing outside the emergency room, clearly wracked with worry. Spotting Sadie, he hurried over.
“You’ve arrived, Mrs. Wall!” he said, his voice cracking. “They’re still trying to revive Mrs. Stewart…”
A wave of dread overwhelmed Sadie.
“How could this happen…” she whispered, her legs nearly buckling.
Nanette quickly steadied her. “Sadie, hold on. It’s going to be alright.”
Sadie gripped Nanette’s hand tightly, her knuckles turning white. She trembled and found herself speechless.
Sadie’s hands were clenched into tight fists, her fingernails digging painfully into her flesh. Her heart seemed lodged in her throat, pounding loudly.
Suddenly, the doors to the emergency room swung open.
A weary doctor appeared, pulling down his mask and massaging his temple. “Doctor, how is my grandma doing?” Sadie stepped forward, urgency lacing her voice.noveldrama
The doctor let out a heavy sigh, his face drawn with concern. “Her condition is critical. She’s barely breathing, and her heartbeat is faint. Immediate life support is crucial, or…” His voice trailed off, leaving the unspoken words hanging in the air, which Sadie understood all too well.
“Please, do whatever you can to save her!” Sadie pleaded, tears streaming down her face, her voice trembling.
“The situation is complex. She’s elderly, and her health issues are severe. It’s best to prepare for any outcome,” the doctor explained gravely.
“A family member needs to sign this.” He handed over a document. With shaky hands, Sadie quickly scanned it and signed without hesitation.
“Doctor, please, I’m depending on you,” she said, her voice cracking under the strain.
With a nod, the doctor turned and went back inside the emergency room.
Leaning against the wall for support, Sadie felt the weight of the day bearing down on her as the doors closed again.
Checking the time, she saw it was nearly five o’clock.
She whispered, “Averi…” A sudden realization hit her—Averi was still at kindergarten, waiting for her.
She turned to Nanette, her voice raspy with fatigue. “Nanette, would you mind picking Averi up from kindergarten for me?”
Seeing Sadie’s worn-out expression and swollen eyes, Nanette’s heart went out to her.
She reassured Sadie confidently. “Don’t worry, Sadie. I’ll take care of Averi. You stay here with your grandmother. Just call me if you need anything.” Sadie squeezed Nanette’s hand tightly, grateful beyond words. 
.
.

###Chapter 413:
“Thank you so much, Nanette. I really appreciate it.”
Nanette patted her hand gently. “Don’t worry. Everything will be alright.” After offering a final comforting glance, Nanette left the hospital.
As Sadie watched Nanette walk away, a profound sense of gratitude washed over her. Her legs trembled, barely able to hold her up.
Seeing her struggle to stay upright, Breck quickly moved to steady her as she swayed.
“Mrs. Wall, are you okay?” Breck asked, his voice filled with concern.
Sadie’s face was ashen, her lips quivering. She fought to find her voice, but dizziness overwhelmed her, blurring her vision momentarily.
Gently, Breck helped her to a nearby bench in the corridor where they both sat.
Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes, trying to steady her breathing.
Barely above a whisper, she said, “I need some water…”
Without hesitation, Breck handed her a cup of warm water.
Her hands trembled as she took the cup and sipped slowly, feeling a slight revival with each sip.
When she opened her eyes, she looked up at Breck, her expression one of confusion and vulnerability. “Can you tell me what just happened?”
With a heavy sigh, Breck began to explain.
“Your grandmother was fine until Mrs. Isabel Wall and Miss Wade arrived. We were told to stay outside, but we could hear raised voices from within. It sounded like quite a heated argument. Once they left, your grandmother…”noveldrama
He trailed off, but Sadie immediately understood the implication.
Her hands balled into tight fists, her nails biting painfully into her palms, veins standing out against her skin.
Your imagination takes flight on g?lnσνs?com
Kyla was involved, of course. Why had she appeared at Myrtlewood Estate, and with Isabel in tow? What could they possibly have said to upset Laura so deeply?
As these thoughts raced through her mind, Sadie’s anger surged, intensifying with each passing moment.
Bolting upright, Sadie swiftly headed towards the exit of the hospital.
“Where are you headed, Mrs. Wall?” Breck asked, quickly following her.
“I need to see Isabel and Kyla!” Sadie shouted, her words sharp and biting. Breck watched with concern as Sadie’s determined figure disappeared into the distance.
He felt the urge to stop her but understood that persuading her otherwise would be futile.
Quickly exiting the hospital, Sadie hailed a cab and instructed the driver to take her directly to Wall Manor.
As the taxi sped along, Sadie was haunted by memories of Laura’s warm, affectionate smile, recalling the years of care and nurturing she had provided.
Laura had been her sole refuge, her anchor in a world full of uncertainty. Protecting Laura from harm was Sadie’s unwavering mission.
Meanwhile, at Wall Manor, the atmosphere was heavy and oppressive. The light from the crystal chandelier harshly illuminated the mahogany furniture, only adding to the somber mood.
Entering the manor, Noah was immediately enveloped by the thick scent of polished wood, which today seemed to tighten around him, overwhelming his senses.
He handed his coat to a servant and, with unease, asked, “Where’s my mother?”
“She is waiting for you in the living room,” the servant replied quietly, his voice tinged with apprehension.
Noah’s brows furrowed slightly as he strode toward the living room.
Isabel sat rigidly on the sofa, her body tight with tension. Her face was dark, and she clutched a document tightly in her hand. 
.

###Chapter 414:
Beside her was Kyla, looking concerned as she patted Isabel’s shoulder in a gesture of comfort and support.
“Noah, you’re finally home! I thought you were going to abandon this family altogether for that woman!” Isabel’s tone was sharp with fury.
Noah calmly seated himself across from her. “What seems to be the matter, Mother?”
Isabel let out a bitter laugh before slamming the document onto the table. “See for yourself!”
It was a paternity test report.
It only took Noah a brief glance to recognize the document. His expression remained blank as he reached for the report and tore it into pieces without a second’s hesitation.
“If this is all you wanted to discuss, I’ll be taking my leave,” he said in a flat tone, as though the matter were of no consequence to him.noveldrama
“Noah!” Isabel screamed. She grabbed a glass of water from the coffee table and hurled it to the floor. The sound of glass shattering rang out in the living room as the shards scattered across the tiles. “Why are you acting like this? You know full well that child isn’t yours, and yet you still—”
“Please, calm down, Isabel,” Kyla interjected softly. “Noah is just confused. He’ll come around.”
She stroked Isabel’s back as she spoke, her cunning gaze flitting over to Noah. Isabel took a deep breath in an obvious attempt to curb her rage.
“Noah, I will ask you one last time. Who will you choose? Either you kick that woman and her illegitimate child out of your life and marry Kyla, or you can stop calling me your mother!”
Noah’s eyes darkened. A moment passed before he spoke.
“Samuel.”
1@?€$? ￠#4€?$ 1? gnovels.c?m
“Yes, Mr. Wall.”
Samuel promptly entered the living room.
“My mother is throwing a tantrum again. Take her to the estate on the outskirts to cool off. We will revisit this discussion later.”
“You—You are actually casting your own mother aside for the sake of a scheming adulteress and her bastard son?” Isabel’s voice quivered in disbelief as she raised a trembling hand and pointed at Noah.
Kyla seized the moment to walk up to Noah and grab his arm, as if she had every right to. “Come on, Noah,” she coaxed, “don’t be upset with your mother. She only wants what’s best for you—”
Noah pulled his arm free, his gaze icy. “Take my mom away,” he said to Samuel in a commanding tone.
Just then, a servant hurried over. “Mr. Wall,” he cried out in a panic. “Your wife is here.”
Noah’s face twitched. Before he could react, a slender figure barged into the living room. Sadie was here.
She wore a simple white dress, and though her face was pale, her eyes carried an icy sharpness that sent chills down Noah’s spine.
“How dare you step into my house!” Isabel ranted as soon as she caught sight of Sadie. “You bitch! You’re a cursed wretch that brought ruin to your own family! And now you’re clinging to my son! Tell me, do you plan on destroying him, too?!”
Every word that spilled from Isabel’s mouth cut deep into Sadie’s heart. She gritted her teeth until her gums almost bled. Her gaze had turned murderous.
The air grew thick with tension, and it felt like they were all waiting for a bomb to detonate.
Still staring at Sadie, Noah felt a ripple of unease. He had never seen her like this before. A strange sense of foreboding washed over him.

###Chapter 415:
What Sadie did next left everyone in the room stunned.
In one swift movement, she grabbed the fruit knife from the table with one hand, while yanking Kyla by the hair with the other.
“Ah!” Kyla’s scream rang out through the house.
Then Sadie lunged forward and pressed the blade against Isabel’s neck, the blade glinting under the light as it rested on the older woman’s fragile skin.
Isabel was paralyzed with fear. All the color drained from her face, and her body went cold. She could feel the icy chill of the blade against her skin.
“What did you do to my grandmother?” Sadie demanded in a trembling voice, each word biting through clenched teeth. It was clear she was barely holding back all the pent-up rage and pain she had suppressed.noveldrama
Her voice seemed to bring Isabel back to her senses. A flicker of doubt appeared in her eyes before they narrowed in anger, and she glared at Sadie, shouting in return, “You’re insane! How dare you press a knife against me? You lunatic! You wretched woman! My grandmother’s condition has nothing to do with me! It was her own—”
“Shut up!” Sadie snapped, her voice shrill and grating. “Did you have something to do with my grandmother’s heart attack?!” she demanded.
Tears streamed down Kyla’s face as Sadie tightened her grip on her hair. She lifted her eyes to Noah and pleaded for help.
“Noah… Save me! Remember, it was me who…” she choked out the words, hoping to invoke Noah’s sympathy.
Noah’s frown deepened as he took in the chaotic scene before him. To say that he was shocked by Sadie’s recklessness would be an understatement, but he could do nothing more than stare at her in fear and concern.
“Sadie, calm down,” he said slowly, his voice low and steady. “Let Kyla go and put the knife down, okay? We can talk about this.”
“Talk?!” Sadie snarled, then let out a mocking laugh. “You expect me to talk to the people who tried to murder my grandmother? What the hell do you take me for?!”

The knife in her hand trembled slightly, a sign that she might cut Isabel at any moment, whether she intended to or not.
“Sadie, listen to me…” Noah held up his hands and took a step toward her, but Sadie’s fiery glare stopped him dead in his tracks.
“Don’t come any closer!”
The air in the living room was suffocating, and everyone’s breathing had turned short and shallow.
Sadie laughed again, just as cold and humorless as before. She suddenly let go of Kyla, then swung her arm and delivered a resounding slap to Kyla’s face. The sound of flesh hitting flesh was particularly loud in the otherwise silent room.
Caught off guard, Kyla stumbled backward with a scream. She cupped her stinging cheek, her head spinning from the force of the impact.
Noah felt a pang in his heart when he saw Kyla get hit. His eyes were clouded with a mix of emotions as he turned to look back at Sadie. The pain in his gaze was like another dagger to Sadie’s chest. Even now, after all that had happened, he still cared about Kyla.
“Noah,” Sadie said, her voice devoid of warmth or feeling. “You’re still protecting her, huh? What is she to you, really? Your true love? The one you always wanted? What does that make me? A plaything you can use and throw away as you please?”
“Noah…” Kyla sobbed loudly. “My face hurts so much…”
Noah’s expression was a mix of worry and frustration. “I’m not trying to protect her, Sadie. I just—”
“Just what?” Sadie cut him off. “You just can’t bear to see her hurt? Just don’t want her to get upset? For once, Noah, ask yourself—did you ever truly care about me?” 
.

###Chapter 416:
Her hand, still holding the knife, twitched, prompting Isabel to let out a terrified scream. “Ah! No, don’t kill me! Please don’t kill me!”noveldrama
“Sadie!” Noah’s voice grew louder and more urgent, though there was an unmistakable note of warning too. “Just calm down, okay? Let go of the knife!”
Sadie ignored him and turned her attention to Isabel. “My grandmother loves me so much. She’s the only one who cares about me. Why did you hurt her? Why?!”
“I didn’t! I didn’t do anything to your grandmother!” Isabel’s voice was hoarse and cracked with fear. “She just—”
“Shut up!” Sadie screamed in her face. “Do you think I’ll believe your lies? You must have done something to trigger her heart attack! You’re all murderers! And I’ll make sure my grandmother gets the justice she deserves!”
Noah could see that Sadie was spiraling out of control, and he knew he couldn’t afford to wait any longer.
He took a deep breath and issued an order. “Samuel, now!”
Samuel hesitated for a moment, glancing between Noah and the frantic Sadie. In the end, he gritted his teeth and rushed forward with a team of bodyguards.
Sadie was quickly overpowered and subdued.
“Let me go!” she struggled and flailed, but it was useless.
The knife fell to the floor during the scuffle.
Overcome by her emotions and the tension that had built up, Sadie finally collapsed, losing consciousness.
Before succumbing to the darkness, she caught a glimpse of Noah cradling Kyla in his arms. The tenderness on his face was the final blow Sadie could endure. In that moment, her heart turned into a cold, empty shell.
Noah strode out of the estate, Kyla cradled in his arms. His grip was firm, unyielding, and his pace relentless.
Against his chest, Kyla rested limply, her pale cheek brushing against the fabric of his shirt. But beneath her fragile exterior, there was a faint smirk—subtle, victorious.
Lаt?st chαpt?rs in glovls.ｃοm
The night beyond the estate was thick with shadows, swallowing the dim glow of the streetlamps.
A sleek black sedan waited by the curb, its presence eerily silent. As Noah stepped out, he wasted no time, pulling the rear door open with a curt nod.
Noah didn’t hesitate. With little care, he tossed Kyla inside.
She tumbled onto the plush leather seat, a sharp gasp escaping her lips. The sting of impact barely registered before the door slammed shut with brutal finality.
Kyla’s breath hitched.
Noah wasn’t getting in?
Uncertainty flickered in her eyes. Her fingers trembled as she reached for the window, rolling it down just enough to peer outside. Swallowing her unease, she softened her voice, lacing it with feigned weakness.
“Noah… my chest is hurting. Please, come with me to the hospital.”
Noah stood still, his gaze locked onto hers. The warmth she sought in his eyes was absent—replaced instead by something far colder.
Without a word, he leaned in, his movements slow, deliberate. Then, in one swift motion, his hand shot through the open window, fingers tightening around her slender throat.
Kyla’s eyes widened in sheer terror as crushing pressure seized her windpipe. Panic surged through her veins.
She clawed at Noah’s wrist, struggling, gasping, thrashing—futile. He didn’t flinch.
“Listen to me carefully.” His voice was empty. Hollow. Devoid of anything human. “If I find out you had anything to do with what happened to Sadie’s grandmother…” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 417:
Then, in a voice as cold as death itself, he murmured, “I’ll kill you myself.” Kyla’s entire body went rigid.
The look in Noah’s eyes—it was unlike anything she’d ever seen before. Raw, unfiltered, murderous intent. A silent promise of something far worse than pain.
Just as suddenly as he had grabbed her, Noah released his grip. Kyla collapsed against the seat, gulping in air, her body trembling violently. Straightening up, Noah turned to the driver. “Take her to the hospital.”
The driver obeyed instantly, starting the car and pulling away without hesitation. Kyla shivered, her arms wrapping around herself. She could still feel the ghost of Noah’s fingers around her throat. And the way he had looked at her… It was a look that would haunt her forever.
Back inside the estate, the living room was a wreck—furniture overturned, shards of glass glinting under the dim light.
On the sofa, Sadie lay unconscious, her face ghastly pale. Nearby, Isabel sat slumped, her complexion no better, her entire body trembling.
Then, the moment Noah stepped inside, Isabel snapped out of her stupor. She lunged toward him, gripping onto his arm with desperate, shaking hands. “Noah, please… I didn’t do anything.” Isabel’s voice wavered, panic seeping into every syllable. “When I left, her grandmother was fine. I didn’t say anything cruel—I swear. I was only looking for Sadie, but she wasn’t there, so I left. That’s all! You have to believe me!”
Her words tumbled out in a desperate rush, her wide eyes searching Noah’s face for any sign of belief. Noah didn’t so much as blink.
He walked past her without a word, his focus solely on Sadie. Bending down, he gathered her into his arms, lifting her as if she weighed nothing at all. His jaw clenched as he looked down at her, unreadable emotions flickering across his face before vanishing behind his usual composure.
Then, he lifted his gaze to Isabel, his voice cutting through the silence like a blade. “No one touches Sadie.”
Isabel felt the blood drain from her face. There was something chilling in the way he said it.

“Samuel.” The door creaked open, and Samuel stepped inside, his posture crisp, awaiting instruction. Noah didn’t take his eyes off Isabel as he spoke. “Take my mother to the estate on the outskirts. She does not return unless I say so.”
Samuel gave a small bow.
“Understood, Mr. Wall.” Turning to Isabel, he extended an arm toward the door, his voice respectful but firm. “Mrs. Wall, if you’ll come with me.”
Isabel’s lips parted as if to protest, but one look at Noah’s expression told her there was no use. He wasn’t negotiating. Swallowing hard, she bit back her words, nodding stiffly, and turned on her heel, following Samuel out without another sound.
Noah exhaled slowly, then carried Sadie outside, his movements steady and deliberate. The Maybach was already waiting. He opened the door and placed her carefully in the back seat.
Sliding in beside her, he shut the door. His voice was calm but firm. “Drive. Take us to the hospital.”noveldrama
The car eased onto the road, slipping into the quiet night.
Noah held Sadie’s hand, his fingers tightening instinctively around hers. She was cold. Too cold.
Without thinking, he pressed her hand against his chest, hoping to transfer some of his body heat to her.
Then, suddenly, a sharp vibration cut through the silence.
Noah pulled a phone from Sadie’s pocket and glanced at the screen. An unfamiliar number.
He hesitated for a fraction of a second before answering.
A woman’s voice, hurried, came through the line. “Sadie? It’s Nanette. I’ve got Averi. I’m taking him to the location you sent—Myrtlewood Estate. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 418:
Noah’s grip on the phone tightened.
His voice was low, steady. “Thank you.”noveldrama
There was a brief silence on the other end.
“Eh?” Nanette’s tone shifted, confused. “Wait… Who is this?”
She blinked, momentarily thrown off by the unfamiliar voice.
Her lips parted to ask, but before she could get a word out, the call abruptly disconnected.
She pulled the phone away from her ear, staring at the screen in confusion. Who was that? Sadie had never mentioned a husband. Not once.
Noah exhaled slowly, slipping the phone back into Sadie’s pocket. His gaze returned to her, her delicate hand still enveloped in his own.
He didn’t know exactly what had happened to Laura. Not yet. But he would find out. And he would give Sadie the answers she deserved.
The next morning, a sharp, sterile scent of disinfectant burned at Sadie’s senses.
Her eyelids fluttered. Her fingers twitched against the crisp sheets. A stark white ceiling. Fluorescent lights glaring overhead.
A hospital.
Panic hit her in waves. Memories crashed into her all at once—shattered fragments piecing themselves together in a violent rush.
The knife in her hand. Pressed against Isabel.
Her breath caught, a sharp, suffocating ache spreading through her chest. Grandma!
Sadie jumped out of bed, her feet tingling from the cold, hard floor.
Not bothering to put on her shoes, she stumbled out of the hospital room.
Your next tale lives on g ? lnσ ν ?s, com
The corridor was alive with activity, filled with people moving in every direction. She grabbed a nurse by the arm, her voice trembling and barely audible. “Excuse me! How is Laura Stewart?”
Taken aback by Sadie’s urgency, the nurse paused before responding. “Co—what? Did you say Stewart?” She searched her memories. “You must be referring to Laura Stewart, right? She… she didn’t make it,” the nurse murmured, her voice dropping to a hushed tone. “We couldn’t revive her. She’s gone.”
The nurse’s words blurred Sadie’s vision momentarily.
Suddenly weak, Sadie felt her legs give way, and she began to fall.
“Sadie!” A strong arm caught her just in time, and a familiar, crisp scent enveloped her.
It was Noah.
Seeing him triggered a flood of sadness and frustration. Tears that she had been suppressing streamed down her face.
In a surge of emotion, she struck him across the face.
The slap echoed down the corridor. A vivid handprint marked Noah’s cheek. He didn’t flinch, nor did he react. His eyes conveyed deep sorrow.
“Why… why did you intervene…” Sadie barely managed to say through her tears.
Her cries became uncontrollable.
Noah embraced her firmly, trying to offer comfort.
With a forceful push, Sadie shoved him back, yelling through her sobs, “She’s dead! My grandmother is dead! I blame myself; it’s all my fault!”
Overwhelmed by grief, she sank to the floor, covering her face as she wept bitterly.
Noah knelt before her, attempting to draw her into an embrace. She recoiled, shoving him away with fierce determination.
“Don’t you dare touch me!” she screamed, her eyes red and filled with anger, fixed on him. “You’re to blame! Your whole family is! You’re the reason she’s gone! I swear I’ll make you regret what happened to my grandmother!”

###Chapter 419:
She pulled herself to her feet, her face marked with deep despair. “My life… it has meant something…”
Watching her collapse back onto the floor, Noah forced himself to keep his composure. He motioned to the nurse, who was still stunned by the scene unfolding. “You’re free to go now,” he whispered.
With a swift nod, the nurse seized the chance to escape, leaving Noah and Sadie alone in the thick air of grief.
Noah made another attempt to help Sadie up, extending his hand cautiously, but she slapped it away sharply.
“Don’t touch me!” Her voice cracked through her tears.
Noah’s eyes remained on her tear-streaked face, and a deep ache filled his heart. He kept his voice steady, trying to break through her distress. “Sadie, please, calm down. Averi is still at Myrtlewood Estate, waiting for you to come back.”
Hearing her son’s name, Sadie showed a brief moment of confusion, which quickly turned to intense hatred. “Are you using Averi to threaten me? Trying to make me forgive your mother and Kyla?” Her voice was thick with contempt.
Just then, Alex rushed into the corridor.
When he saw Sadie in turmoil, his expression softened with profound sadness. He enveloped her in his arms, his whispers tender. “Don’t be afraid, Sadie. I’m right here.”
Grasping Alex’s sleeve desperately, Sadie seemed to find a brief sense of comfort.noveldrama
A chilling smile crept onto Noah’s face as he watched, his eyes briefly flashing with disdain. The sight of Sadie completely reliant on Alex for support sparked an intense fury inside him.
“Yes, I am threatening you,” Noah said coldly, his voice tinged with malice. “Behave yourself if you care about Averi’s safety.”
At his words, Sadie experienced a sudden shock.

Lifting her head quickly, she fixed her gaze on Noah, her eyes wide and fearful.
She tried to speak, but her words faltered, leaving her lips quivering silently. “What?”
Noah raised an eyebrow.
“I didn’t…” Sadie began, but Noah quickly interrupted her.
His hands clenched into fists as he looked into Sadie’s eyes and said deliberately, “Your grandmother is alive.”
“What?” Confusion swept over Sadie, unsure if she had heard him correctly.
“She’s in the adjacent ward, still unconscious.” Noah’s voice softened slightly as he continued, “It’s time you took responsibility for her care, instead of leaving it to my maid.”
With that, he turned and walked away, leaving Sadie and Alex standing there.
Stunned, Sadie remained motionless, her mind struggling to process the news. Her grandmother was still alive?
Acting on impulse, she brushed past Alex and hurried to the next ward. There, Laura lay in the hospital bed, her delicate frame surrounded by medical equipment that beeped softly.
Tears welled up in Sadie’s eyes as she tenderly touched Laura’s face. She glanced at the monitors, which displayed the rhythmic patterns of Laura’s heartbeat, proof that she was still fighting for her life.
“Grandma…” Sadie murmured, her voice trembling as she bent over the bed, crying uncontrollably.
Alex remained a few steps behind, silently observing the emotional scene. His sympathy for Sadie deepened as he watched her sorrow unfold. He gently touched her shoulder, whispering, “Don’t cry, Sadie. Laura will recover.”
Grateful, Sadie looked up at Alex through her tears.

###Chapter 420:
Meanwhile, Noah stormed out of the hospital, his expression clouded with frustration.
From a distance, Samuel, ever attentive, noticed his boss’s sudden exit and hurried over. “Mr. Wall.”
He was puzzled. Noah had just entered the hospital ten minutes earlier. What had caused him to leave so quickly?
Noah kept walking, offering only a brief “Hmm” in response.
“Mr. Wall, I was bringing you the soup,” Samuel said, following him with a thermos in hand.
“This morning, you asked the chef at Myrtlewood Estate to prepare soup for Mrs. Wall. You left it behind when you went in, and now you’re leaving already…”
“No need for that now. Just throw it away,” Noah said dismissively.
Samuel hesitated before asking, “So, should I not deliver it to Mrs. Wall?” Noah massaged his temples, his weariness evident.
“Just discard it,” he instructed firmly.
Before Samuel could respond, Noah halted abruptly. His tone softened unexpectedly. “Wait.”
Samuel tensed, anxiously watching Noah.
“Deliver it to the nurses’ station,” commanded Noah, his voice still cool but slightly gentler than before.
“Right away, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded promptly, though he silently wondered what recent event might have caused the change in Noah’s mood.
Noah walked briskly to the curb where his sleek black Maybach was parked. He pulled open the door and settled into the back seat.
Inside, the cold air from the air conditioning couldn’t soothe his agitation. With his eyes closed, images of Sadie’s despondent look and her grip on Alex’s sleeve haunted him.
Stay connected gα?ησv?s?com
An intense wave of irritation washed over him, sudden and fierce. He opened his eyes, his stare piercing.
“To the office,” he instructed the driver sharply.
The driver, without a word, ignited the engine and drove smoothly from the hospital.
As the car moved, Noah’s fingers drummed a steady beat on the armrest. He replayed Sadie’s biting remarks, the venom in her gaze, and her apparent dependency on Alex in his mind.
His hands balled into fists, the skin over his knuckles stretching taut.
Why did this anger consume him so deeply?
He had merely intended to scare her into submission.
Yet, seeing her so broken and reliant on another was like a vice grip on his heart, making it difficult to breathe.
In frustration, Noah loosened his tie, but the tightness in his chest persisted.noveldrama
What had he been hoping for? Did he expect her to yield? To plead with him?
No, that wasn’t his desire. But what did he truly want?
The pungent smell of disinfectant clung to the air around Kyla. She adjusted the IV needle in her arm, her expression one of annoyance.
“Why isn’t he here yet?” she muttered under her breath, her gaze flicking toward the door.
“Miss Wade, there’s no need for concern. Mr. Wall has many responsibilities; his delay is probably due to urgent matters,” the caregiver reassured her, offering a freshly peeled apple.
Kyla accepted the apple, taking a bite, but it lacked any flavor for her.
“Doctor, I’m still not feeling well. Is it possible to extend my stay here for further observation?” she asked the doctor who was making his rounds, her voice soft and delicate.
.
.
.
###Chapter 421:
The doctor reviewed her medical records, his brow furrowing slightly. “Miss Wade, your health indicators are all within normal ranges. You’re medically fit for discharge. We must keep beds available for those who really need them…”
“Doctor, I insist I’m not well. I’m suffering from dizziness, nausea, and extreme fatigue…” Kyla detailed her symptoms, pressing her fingers to her forehead, her face pale as if she were on the brink of collapse.
The doctor hesitated, aware of Kyla’s significant influence and cautious not to displease her. “But…”
Kyla then added, “I’d like to express my thanks with a small gift,” as she subtly handed a thick envelope from under her pillow to the doctor.
The doctor balanced the envelope in his grasp, and his initial hesitation quickly shifted to a complicit grin. “Well then, if you’re still feeling under the weather, we can extend your observation period, Miss Wade. Please, let me know if there’s anything else you require.”
“Thank you, doctor,” Kyla replied, mustering a frail smile. However, once the doctor departed, her demeanor shifted to one of cunning calculation. “He must come… he will,” she whispered quietly to herself, her eyes sparking with both anticipation and cold resolve.
In Laura’s hospital room, Sadie sat beside the bed, her fingers gently wrapped around Laura’s delicate hand, her face etched with both concern and exhaustion.
Laura lay quietly, her breathing steady, and her complexion looking far better than before.
Alex, visibly relieved, said,
“It was a close call this time. Fortunately, she pulled through.”
He glanced at Sadie and added,
“Sadie, you need some rest. Let me drive you home.”

Sadie gently shook her head.
“No, thanks, Alex. I’d rather you go on without me. I’ll stay here with Grandma.”noveldrama
Alex observed the weariness in her eyes, the way her frame had slimmed from the strain of the past weeks.
“I’m okay,” Sadie said, forcing a small smile to reassure him.
“Please, go back. The Howe Group relies on you.”
Alex hesitated, clearly torn, but eventually nodded.
“Okay. I’ll have my cook prepare some dishes and bring them here. You’ve lost too much weight. Take care of yourself, Sadie.”
Sadie walked him to the doorway of the ward.
“Be careful on the road,” she said softly.
“Got it,” Alex replied, giving her a long, meaningful look before turning to leave.
As Sadie turned back into the room, her eyes fell on Laura, peacefully asleep. A rush of emotion flooded her chest. Everything she had endured in recent days felt like a blur—so draining, so surreal.
Just then, a nurse approached.
“Miss Hudson, there’s a delivery for you.”
Curious, Sadie stepped forward and accepted a thermal container.
“Someone just left this for you,” the nurse explained.
Sadie held the container, her brows furrowing with confusion.
Back inside the room, she opened it carefully. The savory aroma of chicken broth wafted out, instantly transporting her to the kitchen of Myrtlewood Estate.
Why would the estate’s cook send her soup so unexpectedly?
The thought that Noah might be behind this briefly crossed Sadie’s mind, but she quickly pushed it away. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 422:
Could Noah really show such kindness? That seemed far-fetched.
Their relationship had crumbled into nothing more than lingering bitterness. What more was there to hope for?
Sadie clutched the thermal container tightly, her heart heavy with confusion and anxiety.
The scent of chicken broth filled the room, yet she didn’t take a single sip. She merely held the container until her knuckles turned white.
Eventually, she set it aside on the table and turned her attention to Laura, who slept with a peaceful expression.
Waves of guilt surged within her, crashing over her already-frayed emotions.
Her mother was missing. Her grandmother was ill.
Sadie felt utterly powerless in the face of everything.
She thought of the immense power the Wall family wielded—overwhelming, unreachable.
What could she possibly do against them?
“Grandma…” Sadie whispered, her voice breaking as she pressed Laura’s hand to her cheek.
“I’m sorry. I feel so helpless…”
Tears slipped down her cheeks, soaking Laura’s frail hand.
Just then, the door to the ward opened softly, and several unfamiliar doctors stepped inside.
Dressed in crisp white coats, none of them were familiar to Sadie.
An elderly specialist led the group, distinguished by silver hair and gold-rimmed glasses. He carried himself with quiet authority.

Sadie rose, her eyes wide with surprise.
“Good evening, Miss Hudson,” the specialist said gently. “We’ve been assembled by the hospital as a specialist team to consult on your grandmother’s case.”noveldrama
Startled, Sadie instinctively looked at their name tags.
“International Cardiology Association…”
“Mayo Clinic, Maradeiris…”
Her breath caught.
These weren’t just any doctors—they were world-renowned experts.
A flicker of hope stirred within her. Could it be… Noah?
She immediately shook the thought off.
It seemed impossible. Why would Noah help? He’d probably rather see her grandmother disappear from their lives.
“Miss Hudson?” the elder doctor’s kind voice pulled her back from her thoughts.
Sadie wiped her tears and gave a small bow.
“Oh—hello. Thank you all so much for coming.”
The specialists gathered around Laura’s bed, beginning their thorough evaluation.
Sadie remained close, watching every move with her heart pounding.
Time slowed as she waited for their conclusion.
Finally, the examination ended.
“Miss Hudson,” said the elderly specialist, removing his glasses with care. His voice was steady and reassuring.
“Your grandmother’s condition is stable for now. Continued observation and treatment are necessary, but we’ve developed a comprehensive plan. With care, her chances of recovery are high.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 423:
Relief swept through Sadie like a wave. She bowed deeply, her voice thick with gratitude.
“Thank you. Thank you so much.”
“This is what we do,” the specialist replied warmly. “Just remember to look after yourself too. Your grandmother needs you strong.”
After the team departed, Sadie slumped into the chair beside the bed.
She watched Laura’s calm expression, her breathing steady, and for the first time in days, the tightness in her chest began to ease.
Overwhelmed by exhaustion, Sadie slipped into a deep sleep next to the hospital bed without realizing it.
The sounds in the ward slowly faded to silence.
Meanwhile, in another VIP ward, Kyla shifted uncomfortably.
She had been waiting all afternoon for Noah, who had yet to appear.
“Noah, what on earth is keeping you?” Kyla muttered, flinging the magazine she was reading onto a nearby table in frustration.
At that moment, a nurse came in with a medical cart to change Kyla’s IV.
“Miss, do you happen to know where Noah is?” Kyla inquired, unable to hide her curiosity.
The nurse hesitated before responding cautiously. “Mr. Wall… I believe he visited Mrs. Stewart earlier today.”
“Mrs. Stewart?” Kyla’s brow furrowed. “What was he doing there?”
“The word is he brought a team of specialists to consult on Mrs. Stewart’s case. I heard her condition was quite serious, but it has since stabilized, and there’s talk she might regain consciousness soon,” the nurse explained as she expertly changed the IV.
“She might regain consciousness?” Kyla’s complexion lost all color as she turned to face the nurse.

The possibility of Laura waking up filled her with dread. Would Laura tell Noah what she had done to her?
At the time, Kyla had merely intended to rattle Laura with some sharp words. Little did she anticipate that the elderly woman would be so shockingly frail, collapsing into a heart attack.
Kyla refused to accept blame for the incident.
However, recalling the cold stare Noah had given her still made Kyla shudder. She was determined not to let Laura regain consciousness.
A terrifying notion crossed Kyla’s mind.
Struggling to steady her nerves, Kyla walked over to the bedside table, grabbed her phone, and dialed a number she hadn’t used in a while.
“Hello, Willard? It’s me,” she whispered, her voice barely steady.
From the other end came a rough voice, saying, “Ah, Miss Wade. To what do I owe the pleasure today? Need something else taken care of?”
“I need a favor… I need someone gone,” Kyla replied, her voice tense.
“Gone?” The voice chuckled. “That’s a serious request, Miss Wade. Let’s talk about the terms…”
“Five million,” Kyla said firmly, without a moment’s hesitation.
There was a brief pause before the other end responded with a scoff. “Five million for a life? You’re not serious, Miss Wade.”
Desperation crept into Kyla’s voice.
This was no simple task, and the person on the line wasn’t easy to persuade. 
.

###Chapter 424:
“Eight million.” Kyla raised the offer.
“Still too low for the risk.”
“Ten million. That’s my last offer,” Kyla responded tersely.
The tone on the other end shifted from dismissive to obliging.
“Well, Miss Wade, that’s more like it. I’ll take the job. Who’s the target?”
Kyla articulated each syllable with precision.
“Laura Stewart, at the downtown hospital.”
“Consider it done, Miss Wade. It will be handled discreetly, without any complications.”
Kyla hung up the phone and slumped onto the bed, her body shaking uncontrollably.
The ward was heavy with the pungent smell of disinfectant.
Gradually, Sadie stirred, blinking away the grogginess of her nap.
On the hospital bed, Laura lay still, the IV drip marking time with its consistent ticks, filling the quiet room with its sound.
“Grandma…” Sadie’s voice was faint, her throat parched.
She tried to sit up, but her strength failed her; she could only manage to turn her head, her eyes catching sight of the white lilies arranged on the bedside table.
Then, out of the corner of her eye, she noticed a presence.
A doctor, fully garbed in a white coat, mask, and cap, was almost entirely obscured except for his eyes.
He was holding a syringe, moving toward Laura’s bed.
Sadie felt a surge of unease.
g?lnσν?s?com is where magic happens
Her alertness sharpened. She attempted to get a clearer view of the doctor’s face, but he remained bowed, his features hidden.
As he reached the bedside, he silently lifted Laura’s IV tube, poised to inject the contents of the syringe.
“Wait!” Sadie mustered all her energy to shout. “What are you administering to my grandma?”
The doctor froze, his posture tensing for a moment before he slowly faced Sadie.
Sweat was visible on his forehead under the bright lights of the ward, and his eyes betrayed a flicker of panic.
“It’s… it’s just a nutrient solution,” he stammered, voice shaking.
A heavy dread settled in Sadie’s stomach.
If it was just a nutrient solution, what was with all the cloak-and-dagger stuff? Sadie recognized all the doctors who treated Laura, but this one was a stranger.
What legitimate doctor acted so visibly nervous?
“Which department are you from? I’ve never seen you around before,” Sadie said, keeping her voice steady despite the fear building inside her.
The man averted his eyes, his voice shaky as he replied, “I… I’m new. Today is my first shift.”
Sadie’s suspicion escalated.
A new doctor? On his first day?
Why would such a newcomer be administering an injection without the consent of her grandma’s regular doctors?
“Show me your identification badge,” Sadie demanded, her tone icy as her eyes bored into him.noveldrama
The doctor’s agitation increased. He frantically checked his pockets, but his search was futile.
His breathing became more erratic, and sweat began to bead on his forehead. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 425:
“I… I must have forgotten it,” he stuttered, clearly panicking.
Sadie’s instincts screamed that something was terribly amiss.
“Who are you really? What are you trying to do?” Sadie’s voice grew louder and trembled with fear.
Abruptly, the man revealed a gleaming dagger hidden under his coat. The blade shimmered threateningly as he lunged at Sadie.
“Argh!” Sadie yelled, recoiling too late as the blade sliced her arm, sending a jolt of pain through her and drenching her sleeve in blood.
With his disguise compromised, the man’s expression turned malevolent. He turned and dashed away.
“Help! Someone help me!” Sadie shouted for help as her strength faded and her vision grew dim.
Blood spilled onto the clean white sheets, spreading quickly.
As her consciousness slipped away, Sadie collapsed onto the floor, succumbing to the darkness enveloping her.
At Wall Group.
“Mr. Wall, bad news!” Samuel burst into Noah’s office, his entrance hasty, his face ashen.
Noah continued his paperwork, seemingly undisturbed.
“What’s causing your panic?”
“Mrs. Wall got injured at the hospital,” Samuel explained, his voice cracking, his forehead beaded with sweat.
Noah’s pen stopped abruptly, leaving an ink blot on the paper.
He looked up sharply, his eyes cold and piercing.
Unforgettable stories on g?lnσν?so
“Repeat that.”
“There was an attempt on Mrs. Wall’s and Mrs. Stewart’s lives,” Samuel said, his voice trembling, avoiding Noah’s intense gaze.
The cold in Noah’s office was evident, as if his very presence had caused the temperature to drop sharply.
As he sprang from his seat, his pen tumbled from the desk, unnoticed, and hit the floor.
His voice was low and filled with barely restrained fury as he demanded,
“What happened?”
“A man posing as a doctor sneaked into Mrs. Stewart’s room,” Samuel blurted out, his words rushing to keep pace with his thoughts. “Mrs. Wall caught him attempting to inject Mrs. Stewart with something unknown. He attacked her with a dagger and escaped.”noveldrama
“What’s the situation now?” Noah’s voice was cold.
Samuel froze for a moment, not understanding which part Noah was asking about. After a while, he replied,
“The attacker… he got away.”
Noah’s look was piercing.
“I’m not asking about him. How is she?”
Realizing his mistake, Samuel quickly replied,
“Mrs. Wall’s condition has stabilized; it was just a minor cut. She’s already been treated and bandaged. The doctors said because she reacted so fast, the cut was shallow and missed any vital areas.”
Noah’s voice was cold and firm as he commanded,
“Get guards to the hospital now. I don’t want so much as a fly getting through.”
“Absolutely, Mr. Wall,” Samuel answered, preparing to leave. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 426:
Just as he reached the door, he hesitated, turning back slightly.
“Sir, Miss Wade has been asking for you. She’s hoping you could visit…”
After a tense pause, Noah curtly dismissed him.noveldrama
“Get out.”
With a sigh of relief, Samuel quickly left the office, eager to escape the oppressive atmosphere.
“Beep… Beep… Beep…”
Frustrated by the relentless busy tone, Kyla flung her phone onto the plush sofa.
“Fools! All of you are fools!” Her body shook with fury.
The phone rang abruptly. She grabbed it, her rage intensifying when she saw “Willard” on the caller ID.
“How dare you call me after your blunder?”
From the other end of the line, a rough voice responded with annoyance.
“Miss Wade, that’s hardly fair. I put my neck on the line for that task, and now you owe me for the effort, even if it didn’t pan out. Wouldn’t you agree?”
“I owe you? And what exactly are you expecting?” Kyla spat the words out.
“Just a modest two million. Think of it as payment for my effort.”
“Two million? You’re delusional!” Kyla retorted. “You failed the job and then have the cheek to demand a payment?”
“Miss Wade, you should really consider paying, or you might just find yourself regretting it…” Willard’s voice ominously hinted at a threat. “Remember, I’m capable of a lot.”
Kyla paused, drawing a deep breath to manage her rising anger.
Understanding all too well Willard’s dangerous potential as a criminal, she knew defiance might lead him to reveal her dark secret of attempting murder.
Don’t miss it: g?lиov.cоm
“Alright, you’ll get your two million. Just stay out of sight for a while.”
“Deal.” Willard quickly ended the call.
Kyla slumped back onto the sofa, her eyes staring emptily at the ceiling.
First, it was ten million gone, and now, another two million was on its way—these were significant sums for her.
Since Isabel’s relocation to the estate on the outskirts, Kyla had lost her regular financial support.
Money was getting tight, and it was critical that she figured out her next move soon.
Kyla agitatedly tousled her hair and paced to the window, staring out at the lively night lights of the city, overwhelmed by a sense of defeat.
“Why doesn’t Noah even look my way? What is it about Sadie that I don’t have?” she muttered.
The mere thought of Sadie sparked a surge of bitterness within her.
There was no way she would let Sadie go.
The next day, having finalized her discharge paperwork, Kyla picked up her bag and walked shakily from the hospital.
She squinted against the harsh sunlight, her hand raised to shade her eyes, though the darkness within her didn’t lift.
“Miss Wade?” A crisp voice caught her attention.
Lowering her hand, Kyla saw Vivi standing there, impeccably dressed in a business suit, a wrist brace in place.
“Miss Quinn?” Kyla expressed her surprise. “What brings you here?”
“I’m here for a check-up,” Vivi explained, gesturing to her wrist. “This old injury acts up sometimes, especially after long periods of drawing.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 427:
She looked Kyla up and down thoughtfully. “I didn’t expect your return from Slimron to be so quick. It seems Mr. Wall still holds you in high regard.”
Kyla’s face tensed, then she managed a forced smile. “You must be joking, Miss Quinn.”
Vivi raised an eyebrow. “How about we grab a coffee? There’s something I want to discuss.”
After a brief hesitation, Kyla agreed.
They chose a table by the window in a nearby café.
“Two lattes, please,” Vivi said to the waiter before turning to Kyla. “Since you left the city, Sadie’s grown even more arrogant.”
Kyla felt a knot in her stomach. “What has she done?”
Vivi laughed lightly. “She’s now seen as Noah’s better half by everyone in the elite circles. Her influence is growing; she’s feared. Having been Majestic Ego’s chief designer and now Mrs. Wall, she’s become quite the figure.”
Kyla clenched her coffee cup, which had just arrived, her fingers pressing into the porcelain. “What makes her feel so superior?”
“Exactly.” Vivi took a sip of her coffee, setting the cup back down gently. “Men always pursue what’s fresh and exciting. Once the excitement fades, Noah will surely return to you.”
Kyla hesitated, biting her lip. “It seems like Noah genuinely cares for Sadie.”
“Care for her? That’s merely a facade.” Vivi scoffed. “Do you think men are sincere in their affections? You’ve changed so much for him—look at what it’s brought you.”
Vivi’s words stung, and Kyla sat in pained silence, feeling each word like a stab to her chest.
“Will you just stand by and let Sadie take everything?” Vivi’s tone was coaxing. “Are you willing to lose to Sadie?”
Every journey starts at gα?ησν?s?c?
A fire ignited in Kyla’s eyes as she raised her head sharply. “No, I refuse to let that happen. Noah belongs to me.”
“Exactly,” Vivi responded, nodding approvingly. “We have a mutual enemy. Why not join forces once more?”
Kyla stared at Vivi, conflicted emotions flickering across her face.
“What kind of collaboration are we talking about?” Kyla inquired.
“Do you know about the International Jewelry Design Competition?” asked Vivi.
Kyla remained silent and waited for her to continue, her grip on her coffee cup tightening slightly.
“There’s a potential for her to shine there… or for us to intervene,” Vivi said, her eyes twinkling with mischief.
Kyla furrowed her brows, perplexed. “What exactly are you implying?”noveldrama
Vivi leaned in closer. “Imagine if something unforeseen were to occur during the contest. Consider the implications.”
A chill ran through Kyla as she envisioned scenarios of Sadie’s potential misfortune.
“You mean to suggest…”
Vivi raised her hands defensively, feigning innocence. “I’m merely pointing out that accidents happen, right?”
Kyla’s grip tightened on her coffee cup, her knuckles turning white as her mind raced with thoughts.
Would Noah remain by Sadie’s side if her reputation suffered during the competition?
The answer seemed clear.
“I appreciate your advice, Miss Quinn.” Kyla exhaled sharply. “I’ve made up my mind about my next steps.”
“You’re welcome,” Vivi responded, sipping her coffee with a subtle smile playing on her lips. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 428:
Kyla stood up, her posture stiff, but her steps were filled with determination.
From her seat, Vivi observed Kyla walking away, her eyes shining with mischief as she enjoyed her coffee.
This time, she wouldn’t need to get her hands dirty.
She had cleverly manipulated Kyla into a pawn against their common enemy, Sadie.
Success for Kyla would be ideal. But if Kyla failed, it wouldn’t cost her anything. Vivi had steered the situation in her favor without direct action, simply guiding Kyla’s decisions.
As she set her cup down, her smile widened.
In the downtown hospital.
The sound of knocking echoed softly, interrupting the tranquility of Laura’s hospital room.
Startled awake, Sadie adjusted her eyes to the dim light.
“Please, come in.”
The door swung open smoothly as the Howe family’s butler stepped in, a thermos in hand and a gentle smile on his face.noveldrama
“Miss Hudson, Mr. Howe asked our chef to make this soup, insisting it is good for your health.”
As the butler set the thermos on the bedside table, the room was quickly filled with a delicious scent.
As Sadie looked at the soup, her feelings were mixed—appreciative yet uncomfortable.
“Please extend my gratitude to Mr. Howe,” she said, managing a polite but reserved smile.
“Of course, Miss Hudson. Mr. Howe also mentioned that if you or Mrs. Stewart need anything at all, we’re here to help,” the butler replied as he opened the container and poured a bowl of soup for Sadie.
L?tｅst ch?pt?rs in glnovels.ο
Sadie eyed the steaming bowl hesitantly.
Alex’s attentiveness left her uneasy; she was wary of becoming too indebted to him.
“Really, there’s no need. I’m already feeling much better.”
“Please, Miss Hudson, this is a kind gesture from Mr. Howe,” the butler urged warmly. “And don’t forget, Mrs. Stewart could use the nourishment as well.”
Finally giving in to the butler’s earnest plea, Sadie accepted the offering.
“Thank you.”
He smiled in response and departed from the room.
Holding the bowl in her hands, Sadie found herself unable to start eating. She felt overwhelmed by Alex’s concern and the intricate connections it brought up among herself, Noah, and him.
“Ahem… Ahem…” A gentle cough sounded from the bed.
Sadie’s eyes darted to her grandmother.
Laura’s eyelids began to flicker, signaling she might soon rouse from sleep.
“Grandma!” Sadie shouted, abandoning the bowl to clasp her grandmother’s hand by the bedside. “You’re awake, Grandma!”
As Laura’s eyes slowly fluttered open, her gaze seemed a bit clouded.
“Is that you, Sadie?”
“Yes, it’s me, Grandma. It’s really me,” Sadie responded, her voice thick with emotion as tears streamed down her cheeks.
Seeing Laura awake brought a wave of relief to Sadie, calming her previous worries.
She promptly pressed the call button near the bed.
Shortly thereafter, a doctor arrived to thoroughly assess Laura. 
.

###Chapter 429:
“Although she’s out of immediate danger, she remains very weak and needs to rest. It’s critical that she avoids any stress to avert less favorable outcomes in the future,” the doctor warned gravely.
“Thank you, doctor,” said Sadie, expressing her gratitude.
After escorting the doctor out, Sadie resumed her vigil by Laura’s side, eyeing her grandmother anxiously.
“How are you feeling, Grandma? Any discomfort at all?”
Laura gazed at Sadie with affection, her eyes clouded with concern.
“Sadie, you need to tell me the truth. Have you interfered in someone else’s relationship?”
The question caught Sadie off guard.
She was perplexed by Laura’s sudden inquiry.
“Grandma, what are you talking about? I’ve done nothing of the sort…”
“But that woman told me you did such a thing,” Laura whispered, her voice quivering slightly.
A chill ran through Sadie, realizing Laura was talking about Kyla.
Laura’s memory of that conversation was clear.
“She accused you of being the other woman, of meddling in her relationship. And Averi… who is his father?”
Sadie bowed her head, choosing silence.
She was reluctant to reveal those harrowing details to Laura, yet the concern in her grandmother’s eyes demanded answers.
“Grandma,” Sadie said, inhaling deeply to steady her voice, “I never interfered in anyone’s relationship. And Averi is Noah’s son.”
Her tone was gentle yet resolute.

Laura’s expression turned sorrowful as she looked at Sadie.
“My dear, the burdens you’ve carried have been heavy.”
“Grandma…” Sadie’s voice broke as tears gathered in her eyes, her grip on Laura’s hand tightening. “Please, keep this between us. Don’t tell anyone who Averi’s father is.”
With emotional eyes, Laura responded,
“I promise, my dear.”
At that moment, in the CEO’s office on the top floor of Wall Group’s headquarters, a knock disrupted Noah’s concentration.
“Enter,” Noah commanded.
Samuel walked in with deference, stopping at the desk.noveldrama
“Mr. Wall, I’m relieved to report that Mrs. Stewart’s condition is now stable, and she’s no longer in any danger.”
Relief softened Noah’s features ever so slightly.
“Furthermore, your grandfather has scheduled a meeting with your wife tomorrow at ten a.m.,” Samuel continued.
“Understood,” Noah answered, his voice steady despite the brief shadow of concern crossing his thoughtful gaze. “Ensure that the meeting goes undisturbed.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall.”
With that, Samuel exited the office.
Noah shifted his attention back to the darkening view outside the window.
Suddenly, a phone’s abrupt ring pierced the stillness.
He reached for the speaker button and pressed it.
“Mr. Wall, Miss Wade is downstairs demanding to see you,” came the slightly tense voice of the receptionist. 
.

###Chapter 430:
A frown marred Noah’s features, irritation evident in his voice.
“I’m not available. Ask her to leave.”
“But Miss Wade is adamant she won’t depart without a meeting.” The receptionist sounded increasingly distressed.
Feeling a headache coming on, Noah massaged his temples, his expression showing a hint of resignation.
“Alright, send her up.”
Shortly after, the door swung open, and Kyla entered with an elegant stride.
Today, she donned a white dress, her hair flowing over her shoulders, her makeup understated yet charming.
“Noah,” she said gently, her eyes betraying a sense of grievance.
Her lower lip quivered as her eyes showed hints of tears.
“I need you to understand, I never meant to cause Sadie’s grandma any harm. That incident—”
“No need to explain; I’m not interested,” Noah interrupted sharply.
Kyla attempted to continue, but a stern look from Noah stopped her.
“If that’s all you came for, I suggest you leave,” Noah replied firmly, leaving no room for further discussion.
Taking a deep breath, Kyla tried to keep her composure.
“In a few days, it’s my birthday. I’d love for us to celebrate it together, just like old times.”
After a brief silence, Noah gave a slight nod.
“Fine.”

Joy briefly illuminated Kyla’s expression.
“Thank you, Noah.”
“Is there anything else?” Noah asked, his demeanor still detached.
Kyla paused, choosing her words carefully.
“Your mother said something she shouldn’t have that day. Please, don’t hold it against her. She was just concerned about you.”
Remaining silent, Noah lowered his gaze back to his paperwork, indicating his desire to end the conversation.
Recognizing his reluctance to talk further, Kyla turned and quietly left the office.
The office returned to a heavy silence, broken only by the rustling of paper. Noah’s eyes remained on the documents before him, yet the words blurred together, refusing to make sense.
His thoughts were consumed by Sadie—her piercing yet resolute gaze lingering in his mind.noveldrama
In the evening, Noah stepped through the grand entrance of Myrtlewood, pulling at his tie with exhaustion.
The living area felt unnaturally still, a stark contrast to the usual lively energy that filled the space when Sadie was present.
Without hesitation, he headed straight to the study, determined to tackle the mountain of paperwork waiting for him.
“Mr. Wall?” a small voice called from behind.
Noah halted, turning to find Averi seated on the carpet, idly toying with a collection of miniature cars.
Confusion shimmered in Averi’s wide, innocent eyes.
“Has my mom left me behind?” His voice was quiet, carrying the faintest quiver.

###Chapter 431:
Noah stiffened, momentarily caught off guard.
He crossed the room and crouched beside the child.
Averi was dressed in pajamas patterned with cartoon characters, his slightly messy hair and tear-streaked cheeks making him look even smaller.
Noah had never seen this side of him before.
Sadie had always made sure Averi was happy and content.
Averi sniffled.
“Breck said Mom had something to do and told me to be good and sleep. But… but I can’t sleep.”
Noah reached out, running a hand gently through the boy’s soft hair.
“She’ll be back soon,” Noah reassured him.
Averi’s gaze lifted, full of cautious hope.
“Really?”
“Really.” Noah nodded affirmatively.
He picked up a red toy Ferrari from Averi’s hand.
“This one’s your favorite, isn’t it?”noveldrama
Averi nodded, a small spark returning to his eyes.
Noah set the toy on the floor and gave it a gentle push, watching it glide across the carpet.
“Look how fast it goes.”
Averi’s focus shifted, a grin forming as he watched the car roll forward.
For a while, Noah sat with him, playing along. Soon, the boy became completely absorbed in his toys, no longer bringing up Sadie.

As Noah watched him, a wave of unspoken emotions washed over him.
The darkness outside pressed against the windowpanes.
Sadie sat beside Laura’s bed, her gaze resting on Laura’s peacefully sleeping face.
Laura’s breathing was steady and even.
Sadie exhaled quietly, though the weight in her chest remained.
She had no desire to return to Myrtlewood Estate—a place that felt suffocating, filled with nothing but heartache.
All she wanted was to take Laura and Averi somewhere far from it all, where they could live a quiet, uncomplicated life.
The small apartment she had rented, though modest, at least offered them shelter.
There, she didn’t have to navigate the endless conflicts with the Wall family or fend off Kyla’s manipulations. It would just be her, Laura, and Averi—looking after one another.
The thought sparked a fragile glimmer of hope in her heart.
She picked up her phone and dialed Samuel’s number.
The ringing tone echoed in the silence, making her pulse quicken.
“Samuel, it’s me.” Her voice was soft, carrying the slightest tremor.
“Mrs. Wall, good evening,” came a polite response.
“I don’t want to go back to Myrtlewood Estate anymore.” Sadie took a steadying breath, forcing herself to say it aloud.
A pause stretched between them before Samuel finally responded, his tone uncertain.
“Pardon?”
“I mean, I want to bring my grandmother and Averi to stay with me in the place I’m renting,” Sadie replied, her voice firm with determination.
“Well, this is…” Samuel hesitated, clearly uneasy. “Mrs. Wall, I don’t have the authority to decide that. Mr. Wall’s consent is necessary.”

###Chapter 432:
A heavy weight settled in Sadie’s chest, cold dread creeping through her.
Indeed, she had no choice.
“I see,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, tinged with disappointment.
“Mrs. Wall—” Samuel began, but Sadie cut him off.
“That’s enough,” she said, ending the conversation.
Leaning back in her chair, she shut her eyes, allowing silent tears to slip down her face.
The once-idyllic Myrtlewood Estate had become nothing more than a gilded prison she yearned to escape.
She shouldn’t let herself hope.
Noah’s heart wasn’t with her, so what was the point of holding on?
Rather than enduring the suffocating mood at Myrtlewood Estate, leaving with Laura and Averi to build a life of their own was what she really wanted.
Samuel stared at his phone, the screen flashing Call Ended, his brows knitted together. The tone of Sadie’s voice unsettled him, and he grasped the weight of the situation.
Without wasting time, he drafted a message to Noah, relaying the news:
“Mr. Wall, Mrs. Wall just called. She said she has no intention of returning to Myrtlewood Estate and plans to move into her rented place with her grandmother and son.”
The moment he hit send, unease gnawed at him. He knew Noah’s temperament, especially when it came to Sadie.
With a quiet sigh, he hoped—prayed—that Noah would see Sadie’s struggle and not let things spiral further.
In the dim glow of his study, Noah sat buried under stacks of paperwork, his expression grim, concentration unwavering.

Then his phone buzzed. Glancing at the screen, he saw Samuel’s message.
As he read the words, his pupils contracted sharply, and the papers in his grasp slipped from his fingers, scattering across the floor with a sharp rustle.
“She’s refusing to come back?” he muttered under his breath, disbelief lacing his tone.
He shot to his feet, pacing in agitation, flashes of Sadie’s face tormenting his mind.
“Damn it!” His fist slammed onto the desk, the sound echoing through the room.
Reaching for his phone, he nearly dialed Sadie’s number—but hesitated.
Instead, he sank back into his chair, dragging a hand down his face, exhaling deeply.
What was he supposed to do?
Was he really about to lose her?
Inside his study, Noah tossed his phone onto his desk in utter irritation. The screen displayed a message from Samuel.
Sadie wanted to leave, and she wanted to take Laura and Averi with her. She wanted to leave his life for good.
He tugged at his tie while huffing in frustration, then walked to the floor-to-ceiling window that overlooked the city.
The lights from the establishments and the streets looked bright and cozy, but Noah only felt more isolated at the sight of them.
“How,” he muttered in disbelief, “how can she leave, just like that?”
His mind was filled with Sadie’s gentle smile and Averi’s innocent voice, and a dull ache began to spread in his chest.
He couldn’t lose them.
The thought of Averi suddenly gave Noah an idea. Perhaps he should start with the little boy.noveldrama
Noah strode back to his desk and grabbed his phone to call Breck.

###Chapter 433:
“Hello, Mr. Wall,” Breck greeted respectfully.
“Is Averi asleep?”
“Yes, Mr. Wall.”
“All right. Listen, I need you to go to the hospital tomorrow.” Noah’s tone was firm as he gave his instructions.
When he finally hung up, there was determination in his eyes.
As long as Averi wanted to stay with him, Sadie had no choice but to stick around as well.
Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains of the hospital room as a new day began.
The door opened softly, and a middle-aged man in a neatly pressed suit walked in. It was Breck.
Sadie blinked at him in surprise. The air in the room immediately grew tense, and she herself felt like a tightly wound spring.
Sadie stood up and asked politely,
“Is there something Mr. Wall wishes to convey?”
Breck gave her a slight, respectful bow.
“Mr. Wall has asked me to bring you to Wall Group. Averi misses you, Mrs. Wall.”
“The Wall Group?” Sadie echoed, her brows furrowed in confusion.
“Yes,” Breck replied. “Mr. Wall took Averi to the company.”noveldrama
Sadie felt her heart sink and a chill run down her spine.
Noah had taken Averi to the company?
What was that damn man up to now?
Don’t miss fresh updates on gα?ησνs?c?m
Sadie pressed her lips into a thin line, her mind racing.
She didn’t want to see Noah—that much hadn’t changed. But his sudden attention on Averi left her feeling a mix of confusion and apprehension.
She kept wondering what could possibly be going on.
Taking a deep breath to steady herself, she looked at Breck.
“Mrs. Wall, please,” Breck prompted, his tone as respectful as ever.
Sadie glanced at Laura one more time, then finally nodded.
As things stood, she would have to see Noah to understand his intentions, whether she wanted to or not.
Leaning over, she whispered to her grandmother,
“I’ll be back soon, Grandma.”
Then she followed Breck out of the hospital room.
Less than an hour later, Sadie stepped out of the elevator onto the top floor of the Wall Group building. She followed Breck and entered a striking reception area located just outside the CEO’s office.
The city skyline was visible through towering glass walls, and the décor was simple yet elegant. It reminded her of a five-star hotel.
“Please wait a moment, Mrs. Wall,” Breck said before knocking on the CEO’s office door.
“Come in,” came a deep, familiar voice from inside.
Breck opened the door and stepped aside, gesturing for Sadie to enter.
She stepped into the office—and froze.
The furniture in Noah’s spacious office had all been pushed aside. In the center of the carpeted floor was a massive pile of toys—cars, robots, building blocks, even plush animals. The colorful collection was spread out chaotically.

###Chapter 434:
And there, in the middle of it all, was Averi. He was happily playing with a Transformer toy, his laughter echoing through the room.
Noah sat beside him, holding a remote-controlled car and patiently teaching Averi how to use it.
He wore a gentle, almost tender expression—a stark contrast to his usual stern demeanor.
Standing at the doorway, Sadie was stunned as she watched the joyful scene unfold before her eyes.
“Mom!” Averi, with his sharp eyes, spotted her instantly. He dropped the toy in his hands and scampered toward her on his tiny legs.
Sadie bent down and scooped him into her arms, holding him close.
“Mom, look! So many toys!” Averi exclaimed, his face alight with excitement as he pointed at the mountain of toys on the floor.
Sadie glanced at Noah, her expression a mix of emotions.
“Why are you doing this?”
Noah stood up and walked toward her, a faint smile on his face.
“Sadie, I think Averi really enjoys it here. Don’t you think?” His voice was gentle as he tested her reaction.
Sadie’s heart sank. She understood Noah’s underlying intentions all too well.
“Averi, do you like it here?” she asked softly, looking into her son’s eager eyes.noveldrama
Averi nodded enthusiastically. “I like it! There are so many toys!”
A sharp, lingering pain spread through Sadie’s chest.
“But we can’t stay here just because of that,” she managed to say, trying to keep her voice steady.

“Why not?” Averi’s confusion was clear.
Seizing the moment, Noah interjected,
“Averi, if you stay here, all these toys will be yours. But if you leave with your mom, you won’t have them.”
Averi’s eyes widened. “Really?”
Noah nodded. “Of course.”
Averi turned to Sadie, his face filled with hopeful anticipation. “Mom, can we stay here? Please?”
The pain in Sadie’s heart deepened. She faced Averi’s innocent gaze, torn by his request.
She knew Noah was using Averi, but she couldn’t bring herself to say no to him.
“Averi, these toys won’t last forever. We can’t make decisions based just on them,” she explained gently.
“Sadie.” Noah cut in. “I just want to provide Averi with a stable environment where he can be happy. Isn’t that what you want for him?”
Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Sadie gently put Averi down.
“Noah, what exactly are you trying to achieve here?” She met his gaze squarely, her voice tinged with a hint of defiance.
Noah remained silent at first, then knelt to meet Averi’s eyes, speaking with gentle sincerity.
“Averi, tell your mom. Do you want to stay here?”
Averi looked between Sadie and the colorful pile of toys. After a brief pause, he nodded, his voice small but hopeful.
“I do.”
Sadie felt her heart drop.

###Chapter 435:
Seeing the simple joy in Averi’s eyes—a joy rooted in the playful allure of toys—tangled her emotions into a painful knot.
From the moment he was born, Averi had never had the chance to spend time with his biological father.
Now that he finally could, she couldn’t bring herself to take it away from him.
Even if Averi didn’t yet know that Noah was that man.
Sadie clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms until they nearly broke the skin.noveldrama
She was determined not to let Laura stay in Noah’s house any longer, fearing that more harm might come to her.
To Sadie, Noah’s home was a beautiful prison—opulent and inviting, yet ultimately restrictive and suffocating.
Noah, observing her inner turmoil, furrowed his brows.
“Sadie, please, let’s talk about this.”
“Talk? What’s there to talk about?” Sadie’s voice cracked, tears threatening to spill.
“Do you think you can make me compromise with toys? Do you think I can just overlook everything that’s happened?”
“No, let me explain,” Noah said quickly, his tone earnest. “You misunderstood me three years ago. I never meant to hurt you.”
“I misunderstood you?” Sadie’s tears spilled freely down her cheeks.
“What about what happened to my grandmother recently? Was that also a ‘misunderstanding’?”
Her voice trembled with emotion, barely holding back her sobs.
“Noah, you owe me. You owe my grandmother. How do you plan to make amends?”
The sight of her tears pained him.
He reached out instinctively to comfort her, but Sadie swatted his hand away.
“Don’t touch me!” she snapped, stepping back with a fierce glare.
Then, resolutely, she turned to her son.
“Averi, we’re leaving.”
Averi hesitated, his eyes lingering on the pile of toys.
“But Mom, the toys…”
Sadie crouched down to look Averi in the eyes. She was holding back her tears as she said,
“These toys are great, sweetheart, but we can’t give up our principles for toys. We need our own home. We can’t keep relying on other people.”
“But I like it here…” Averi whined, his lips pursed into a pout.
Sadie’s heart ached seeing him like this, but she refused to be swayed.
“I promise you, okay? I’ll buy you lots and lots of toys in the future, even better ones than these.”
With that, she picked up Averi and carried him to the door.
“Wait, Sadie!” Noah called out frantically after them.
But Sadie ignored him and kept walking forward.
The office door closed with a loud bang behind her, making Samuel flinch.
Standing just beside the door, he glanced over the scattered toys.
Noah had each toy specifically airlifted from overseas, and every single one was as expensive as the transportation costs.
Averi had been playing so happily just moments ago, and now…

###Chapter 436:
Samuel took a cautious step toward the desk, his voice hushed.
“Mr. Wall…”
Noah leaned back in his leather chair, his fingers tented in front of him, his eyes still fixed on the closed door.
The look on his face made Samuel hesitate.
“The toys…” he tried again, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Send them back to Myrtlewood Estate,” Noah said, his voice low and laced with exhaustion.
“Yes, Mr. Wall.” Samuel didn’t dare ask any further questions. He quickly dropped to a crouch and began picking up the toys, one by one.
The office was eerily silent, broken only by the muffled rustling as Samuel gathered the toys into a neat pile.
Not once did Noah take his gaze off the door. His mind kept replaying Sadie’s figure as she walked out—her straight back, her resolute stride.
He had thought he could make amends. Clearly, he was wrong.
Noah’s hands clenched into fists so tight his knuckles turned white and the veins on the back of his hands bulged.
“Samuel,” he said after a long pause, his voice rough.
“Yes, Mr. Wall?” Samuel stood up and dusted off his trousers.
“Which kindergarten does Averi go to?”
Samuel was visibly surprised. He hadn’t expected that question.
He thought for a moment before replying carefully,noveldrama
“Well, Averi used to attend one abroad. Since returning to Helva, he’s been attending Sunshine Kindergarten.”

Noah’s brows knitted into a frown.
“Actually, Mr. Wall… well, I heard from Breck that next Monday is Parents’ Day at Sunshine Kindergarten. It’s when parents take their kids to kindergarten and stay for the day.” Samuel’s tone was cautious. Judging by Noah’s mood, he knew he needed to tread carefully.
Noah tapped his fingers on the desk, and Samuel could almost feel each dull thud echoing in his own chest.
The air grew thick with tension.
“Cancel all my appointments for next Monday,” Noah finally said, his voice filled with renewed determination.
“Everything?” Samuel repeated.
In response, Noah turned and shot him a sharp look.
“Got it, Mr. Wall.” Samuel quickly nodded and lowered his head, silently repeating the word everything in his mind.
He made quick work of packing up the toys, then quietly exited the office.
The moment he stepped into the reception area, he let out a long, heavy breath. It felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
But then a thought struck him. There was a problem.
Samuel hesitated, debating with himself for a moment before finally knocking on the office door again and stepping inside.
“Excuse me, Mr. Wall…”
“What is it now?” Noah asked impatiently.
“Next Monday is also Miss Wade’s birthday,” Samuel said, then held his breath, bracing for the response.
A heavy silence fell over the room, thick with unspoken tension. 
.

###Chapter 437:
Samuel’s heart pounded in his chest. He feared it might leap out at any second.
“I know,” Noah said at last, his voice cold and emotionless.
Samuel was stunned. Mr. Wall had known—and still, he had ordered everything canceled?
“Leave,” Noah snapped.
Without another word, Samuel turned on his heel and exited.
Once outside, he paused and took another deep breath to steady himself before returning to his tasks.
The apartment carried a faint, musty smell. Sadie set her suitcase down, took a deep breath, and tried to swallow the bitterness rising inside her.
Thankfully, Averi’s attention was immediately captured by the cartoon playing on the TV.noveldrama
Sadie took a moment to call Carol, the nanny who had previously cared for Averi. She briefly explained her situation, and Carol readily agreed to come over as soon as possible.
Sadie glanced at Averi, who was now completely immersed in the show, and began tidying up the apartment.
She dusted the furniture and unpacked her suitcase, methodically sorting through her belongings. Her movements were mechanical, her mind numb.
While wiping the table, she suddenly remembered Nigel’s invitation. Picking up her phone, she was just about to call him when it rang. The caller ID displayed Wall Manor’s landline.
“Hello?” Sadie answered.
“Hello, Mrs. Wall. This is Gabriel,” the butler said respectfully, just as he always did. “Mr. Nigel Wall has an urgent matter to attend to and needs to travel abroad. I’m afraid today’s meeting must be canceled.”
Stay connected through gα?ησνs?com
Sadie’s fingers tightened slightly around the phone.
“I understand,” she replied, trying to keep her voice calm. “Do you know when he’ll return?”
“That is uncertain at the moment. I will contact you once he’s back in the country,” Gabriel replied.
“Alright. Thank you.”
Sadie hung up and slumped against the wall.
“What’s wrong, Mommy?” Averi asked with concern, having noticed her unusual demeanor.
“It’s nothing, sweetheart.” Sadie exhaled deeply, forcing a smile. “Mom’s about to make dinner. What would you like to eat?”
The boy’s eyes lit up with excitement. “I want glazed chicken!”
“Alright, then. Mom will make it for you.” She ruffled his hair before heading toward the kitchen.
Sadie’s thoughts wandered as she prepared dinner, only snapping back to reality when a knock came at the door.
“That must be Carol.” She wiped her hands and went to answer it.
She was relieved to see the familiar face on the other side.
“I’m here, Miss Hudson!” Carol greeted cheerfully, but then her brows knitted with worry. “Are you alright? You look pale.”
Sadie mustered a smile.
“I’m fine, just tired. Averi is watching TV. Please look after him for a while. I need to be somewhere.”

###Chapter 438:
“Go and do your business. I’ll take care of the little champ,” Carol said with a smile as she walked into the apartment.
Sadie returned to the kitchen and packed some of the chicken and salad into a thermal food container.
She was greeted by the chilly autumn breeze as soon as she stepped outside. Shivering in her coat, she hailed a cab and gave the driver the hospital’s address.
Throughout the ride, her mind remained a tangled mess.
She didn’t even notice when they arrived at the hospital until the driver called out to her. Startled, she paid the fare and got out.
Sadie entered the hospital and headed straight to Laura’s ward.
She found the elderly woman sitting up in bed, staring blankly out the window.
“Grandma,” Sadie said softly as she approached.
Laura slowly turned her head, her eyes lighting up when she saw who it was.
“You’re here, Sadie,” she said in a weak, quiet voice.
“Yes, and I brought you some food.” Sadie opened the thermal container and placed it on the bedside table.
“Oh, vegetable salad and glazed chicken!” Laura beamed. “You always know what I like.”
“Then please eat a lot, Grandma.” Sadie scooped a portion onto her plate.
Laura had only taken a few bites when she suddenly paused, her gaze fixed on Sadie.
“How are things with Noah?”
Sadie’s breath hitched.

“It’s over,” she replied, avoiding her grandmother’s eyes.
“Over?” Laura echoed, bewildered. “Why?”
Sadie took a deep breath before recounting everything that had happened.
Laura remained silent for a long time.
“Sadie,” she finally said, her voice heavy with sorrow. “You’ve been through a lot, my dear.”
Sadie’s eyes turned red with unshed tears.
“I’m all right, Grandma. As long as you get better, I’m not afraid of anything.”
“My silly girl.” Laura reached out with her frail hand and gently stroked Sadie’s cheek.
“I’m afraid your grandmother is old and useless now. You’ll have to walk the path ahead on your own.”
“Grandma, please don’t say that.” Sadie clutched Laura’s hand in both of hers.
“You will get better, I promise. We’ll live a happy life and watch Averi grow up together.”
Laura’s expression softened with love. She embraced her granddaughter tightly, their quiet sobs echoing softly through the ward.noveldrama
A few days later, the light from crystal chandeliers cascaded through the banquet hall like a waterfall. The champagne flute tower sparkled under the light, and the exquisite tableware reflected a dazzling brilliance. The air was perfumed with the scent of expensive fragrances, mingling with the fresh aroma of flowers, all signaling the luxury and grandeur of the event.
Kyla, dressed in a fiery red gown as vibrant as a blooming rose, examined her reflection in the mirror, ensuring every detail of her makeup was flawless. “How does this dress look? Does it complement my complexion perfectly?” she asked Vivi, her voice tinged with pride.
Vivi offered a perfunctory smile, replying, “It’s beautiful. You’re definitely the standout today.”

###Chapter 439:
But internally, Vivi sneered. Kyla was so assured, thinking a red dress would sway Noah.
“Of course,” Kyla responded, unaware of Vivi’s insincerity. She adjusted the diamonds on her dress, her eyes alight with ambition. “Today is my birthday. Noah will surely surprise me.”
She walked over to the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing out at the bustling crowd below.
“Kyla, do you really think Noah will propose to you?” Vivi probed, joining her by the window.
Kyla turned, a brief flicker of doubt crossing her features before she restored her confident smile. “Of course, he loves me. He’ll propose, sooner or later.” Vivi observed her feigned poise, sneering inwardly.
Kyla was prematurely counting her blessings, thinking she had everyone fooled.
“Really? But I’ve heard that Noah has been quite close to Sadie recently,” Vivi mentioned deliberately, watching Kyla’s reaction.
Predictably, Kyla’s expression darkened immediately. She bit her lip hard, anger flaring in her eyes.
“That wretched Sadie! How dare she try to take Noah from me!” Kyla’s voice became shrill, her fists clenching until her knuckles whitened.
“Calm down, Kyla,” Vivi said, patting her shoulder.
“I won’t let her win. I’ll make sure she stays away from Noah,” Kyla seethed.
“And how do you plan to do that?” Vivi inquired, her interest piqued.
Kyla took a deep breath, trying to compose herself. She walked over to the table, picked up a glass of red wine, and downed it in one gulp.
“I’ve already made plans. Tonight, I will ensure that Noah and…” Kyla paused, her eyes burning with resolve. “I will become pregnant with his child.”
L?tst chαpt?rs in glnovels.cm
Vivi observed her with a sneer hidden behind a polite smile. Kyla believed that having a child would secure her position with Noah. How naive!
“Good luck with that,” Vivi said dryly, raising her glass to clink against Kyla’s with a hint of irony sparkling in her gaze.
As the banquet hall filled up, the atmosphere buzzed with the chatter and laughter of arriving guests. Kyla, maintaining a composed facade, greeted each guest with a practiced smile, though her eyes kept darting towards the entrance, searching for Noah.
Time ticked by, and with each passing minute, Noah’s absence gnawed at her composure.
“Why isn’t he here yet?” she whispered to herself, her expression tinged with worry.noveldrama
Vivi approached, feigning concern. “What’s the matter, Kyla? You seem uneasy.”
“It’s nothing. Just feeling a bit tired,” Kyla replied, masking her anxiety with a strained smile.
Just then, the doors of the banquet hall swung open, and a tall figure stepped in. Kyla’s face instantly brightened with relief and happiness.
“Noah!” She moved elegantly toward the entrance, her heart swelling with anticipation of Noah’s arrival.
But reality struck harshly.
The newcomer was not Noah, but his assistant, Samuel. Dressed sharply, Samuel nodded with formality, “Happy birthday, Miss Wade.” He presented her with a beautifully wrapped gift box. “This is from Mr. Wall.”
Kyla’s smile stiffened. She kept her composure as she took the gift, though her fingers quivered slightly. Whispers spread through the guests in the banquet hall, and the once lively atmosphere grew tense.
Many attendees had hoped to meet Noah, aiming to forge connections with Wall Group. His absence left them visibly disheartened.

###Chapter 440:noveldrama
“Isn’t Kyla Noah’s beloved? Why didn’t he show up himself?” “Could it all be just a rumor?”
Those whispers stung Kyla’s ears sharply, her cheeks flushing with humiliation. She inhaled deeply, stifling her frustration, and faced Samuel, her voice steady. “Where is Noah? Why isn’t he here?”
Samuel’s expression carried a trace of regret as he answered, “Mr. Wall has an urgent matter to attend to.”
“What’s the urgent matter?” Kyla practically spat the words through gritted teeth.
She had poured her heart into meticulously planning her birthday banquet, eagerly anticipating Noah’s arrival. However, instead of the joyous encounter she had envisioned with Noah, she faced a crushing disappointment. How could she endure this humiliation?
Samuel bowed slightly, his voice tinged with regret. “I’m sorry, Miss. I don’t know the details.” His words felt like a slap.
Around them, guests began whispering, their gazes filled with open mockery.
“Seems Miss Wade isn’t as important to Mr. Wall as she thought.”
“I thought they were close. Guess not.”
“We should leave. There’s nothing interesting happening here.”
One by one, the guests made excuses to depart. The once vibrant banquet hall soon echoed with eerie silence.
Kyla stood frozen, her face ghostly pale.
Vivi approached with deliberate steps, her heels clicking on the marble. Her expression held a trace of disdain, thinly veiled by concern.
“Are you all right, Kyla?” Vivi asked, her tone dripping with false sympathy as she gently patted Kyla’s shoulder. “Don’t take it too hard. Maybe Mr. Wall has a critical issue to handle.”
Kyla’s head snapped up, her eyes blazing.

“I heard he cleared his schedule for today,” she hissed.
A flicker of something unreadable crossed Vivi’s face. She paused, feigning a sudden realization. “Oh, today seems to be the Parents’ Day at the kindergarten Sadie’s son attends.”
Confusion flashed across Kyla’s face.
Vivi’s voice was casual, yet pointed. “Maybe… Mr. Wall went to the kindergarten?”
Kyla’s breath hitched.
Impossible!
She shook her head violently, as if trying to dispel the terrifying thought. A wave of discomfort surged through her chest, her hands clenched into fists, nails digging into her palms.
“I need to see for myself,” she muttered through gritted teeth, spinning on her heel and storming toward the dressing room.
Vivi watched her departure, a cold smirk playing on her lips.
Driven by curiosity and with nothing better to do, Vivi decided to follow and witness how the drama would unfold.
Kyla quickly changed into a simple outfit, grabbed her bag, and hurried out of the hall. She drove through the streets, thoughts of Noah and Averi swirling in her mind.
She couldn’t lose. She couldn’t let Sadie take Noah away from her.
The sun shone brightly, colorful flags fluttered in the breeze, and the sound of cheerful children’s songs filled the air at the kindergarten.
Noah stepped onto the scene, his casual attire doing nothing to diminish his inherent sophistication. His arrival caught the attention of many parents, and even the young teachers found themselves stealing glances.

###Chapter 441:
A young teacher with a ponytail and a shy smile approached him. “Excuse me, sir. May I ask which child’s parent you are?”
“Averi Hudson,” Noah answered simply.
“Averi…” The teacher, Betsey Vargas, was stunned for a moment, then said, “Please, follow me.”
She led Noah toward a corner of the playground.
From a distance, Noah saw a small figure engaged in a heated argument with another child.
“Why didn’t your dad come? Do you even have a dad?” taunted a chubby boy, arms akimbo.
“My dad… My dad is just busy,” Averi insisted, his face flushing red as he stood his ground.
“Hah! I bet you don’t even have a dad. Maybe your mom…” The chubby boy’s taunt was cut off by his mother, a woman clad in a fur coat and dripping with jewelry, who said with a sharp, disparaging tone, “Maybe your mom had you with some random man. You’re nothing but a bastard.”
Averi’s fists clenched tightly, his eyes brimming with tears he refused to shed. “You’re lying! My mom isn’t like that,” he burst out, shoving the chubby boy with all his might.
The boy stumbled and fell, bursting into dramatic sobs.
“How dare you lay a hand on my son!” the woman in the fur coat shrieked, advancing towards Averi.
At that moment, Betsey intervened, quickly stepping between the two children. “What’s going on here? Why are you fighting?” Betsey asked, her voice filled with urgency.
“Ms. Vargas, he started it. He insulted my mom,” Averi explained, his voice trembling.
“I didn’t. He hit me first,” the chubby boy countered, his wails growing louder. Caught in the middle, Betsey struggled to determine who was at fault. It was then that Noah stepped forward.
Your escape begins with g?lnσνsm
When Averi saw him, his resolve crumbled. He ran to Noah and threw his arms around him, clinging desperately.
Noah’s heart melted. He gently rubbed Averi’s back, asking softly, “What happened, Averi?”
Between sobs, Averi managed to say, “They… they said awful things about Mommy…”
Noah’s face hardened, his eyes narrowing sharply as he turned towards the chubby boy and his mother.
“What did they say about your mother?” Noah’s voice was quiet but carried a commanding presence that seemed to weigh down the atmosphere around him.noveldrama
The chubby boy was so scared by Noah’s imposing presence that he scampered behind his mother with a whimper.
The woman herself froze in her luxurious fur coat the moment she caught sight of Noah, her earlier arrogance dissipating into the air. She recognized him—her company had business dealings with the Wall Group. She knew she couldn’t afford to offend the business tycoon before her.
Just then, the chubby boy’s father also arrived at the scene. He had been furious on the way, and was all too ready to berate the boy who had attacked his son. Predictably enough, he froze at the sight of Noah, color draining from his face.
“M—Mr. Wall…” the father stammered, cold sweat beading on his forehead.
Noah drew Averi closer in his arms and swept a cold glance over the family of three. He said nothing, and the atmosphere only grew thick with tension and a keen sense of impending danger.
After a long beat of silence, Noah finally spoke. “I am Averi’s father.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 442:
That one, simple statement fell like a bomb, exploding in front of everyone present. Both parents of the chubby boy trembled with fear. Neither could have imagined that the child they had looked down on was actually the son of the mighty Noah Wall.
“Apologies, Mr. Wall. We were unaware…” The father rushed to apologize as he yanked his son from behind his wife and pushed the boy toward Noah. “Hurry and apologize to Mr. Wall and his son!”
The poor boy was too scared to even lift his head, and all he could do was mutter a weak, “Sorry.”
Noah ignored their pathetic pleas and turned to walk away. “Don’t be afraid, Averi,” he said, stroking Averi’s head. “I’m here for you.”
Averi clung tightly to Noah and sobbed in the crook of his shoulder, though he did feel a wave of relief wash over him at last.
Meanwhile, the parents of the chubby boy watched with dread as Noah disappeared into the distance, knowing that they had just made an enemy out of a very powerful man.
Noah looked around, but he didn’t see Sadie anywhere.
“Averi, where’s your mom?” he asked, his voice softening without him even noticing.
“Mom…” Averi sniffled, pulling back slightly in Noah’s embrace. “Mom isn’t here yet.”
Noah’s heart faltered a little.
He set Averi down and took the boy’s hand before leading him to the edge of the playground, where a bunch of toys and several trays of play dough were laid out.
“Why don’t we play for a while?” Noah asked.
Averi nodded promptly and grabbed a chunk of blue play dough. He let go of Noah’s hand and began to mold it.

Noah sat quietly beside him, watching the little boy’s hands work as his thoughts drifted elsewhere.
Wasn’t Alex the father of Averi? That bastard had always acted so caring toward Sadie and Averi, but now, it seemed like it was all for show.
No one in this kindergarten seemed to even know who Averi’s biological father was.
At that same moment, Sadie was frantically tapping at her steering wheel. It was the lunchtime rush hour, and the traffic had come to a standstill. She didn’t want to miss Parents’ Day.
When she finally pulled over in front of the kindergarten, she all but jumped out of her car and sprinted toward the playground. Then, she saw Noah, and she immediately stopped in her tracks. He was sitting calmly with Averi, tinkering with play dough.
Sadie’s breath caught in her throat.
What was he doing here?
“Sadie,” Noah called out, pulling her back to her senses.
She walked over just as he stood up. “Why are you here?” she asked.
“I was just passing by and thought I’d drop in,” Noah replied with a shrug. Their conversation was interrupted when Betsey clapped her hands and announced, “Children, it’s time to gather round!”
Sadie walked past Noah and waved at Averi. “Go ahead, sweetheart. Your teacher is calling for you.”
Averi obediently stood up and toddled away to join the group of kids. Sadie was about to head over to the parents’ waiting area when Noah took her wrist in a gentle grip.
“I guess Alex doesn’t care that much about you and Averi, huh?”
Sadie whirled around, stunned by his words. “That’s not true,” she said, awkwardly pulling her hand free. “Alex is just busy.”
The look Noah gave her was piercing. “Have you ever thought about getting a stepfather for Averi?” noveldrama

###Chapter 443:
Sadie’s head jerked up, her heart suddenly racing as she met his gaze. “What are you talking about? That’s not an appropriate question.”
She turned away and strode to the waiting area. Noah watched her go without protest, a meaningful smile playing on his lips. He waited for a few moments before following her.
The games had already commenced by the time he sat down next to her.
Sadie was settled in the parents’ area, her eyes fixed on Averi as she tried to swallow the anxiety that threatened to overwhelm her.
Then, Noah plopped down beside her, making her tense up even more.
Today’s event included a family interaction section.
Sadie looked at the handbook in her hand and read the rules for the umpteenth time. She had never been good at public activities like this.
She had considered not participating, but she couldn’t bear to disappoint Averi, not when he had such an expectant look on his face.noveldrama
Averi ran over to her and took her hand. “Mom!” he said, hopping in excitement. “Let’s play a game together!”
Just like that, Sadie’s fears melted away. She ran a hand through the boy’s soft hair and smiled. “Sure.”
Noah lingered on the sidelines, observing the interaction between Sadie and Averi, an unintentional smile forming on his face.
“In this game, parents will carry their kids and hop toward the finish line,” Betsey announced through a loudspeaker.
Sadie inhaled deeply, crouching down so Averi could climb onto her back. “Hold on tight, sweetheart.”
“Okay!” Averi eagerly wrapped his arms around Sadie’s neck, his small body pressing against her back, basking in her warmth. “Ready, set, go!”
M d?  g.?
The whistle pierced the air, and the parents, clutching their children, sprang forward with determination.
Despite not being athletic, Sadie pushed herself for Averi’s sake.
Noah trailed closely, his focus fixed on Sadie, a flicker of worry in his eyes. “Go, Mommy! Go, Mr. Wall!” Averi shouted excitedly, waving his tiny hands in encouragement.
Sadie gritted her teeth, sweat trickling down her forehead, refusing to slow down.
At last, they crossed the finish line.
Averi bounced up and down with excitement. “Mommy, we won!” Sadie panted, but satisfaction radiated through her smile.
As the competition continued, they worked in perfect sync, dominating each round.
The final challenge was the “Three-Legged Race.”
Sadie and Noah stood side by side, their ankles securely bound.
“Stay in rhythm with each other,” Betsey reminded the competing parents.
“Understood.”
Sadie and Noah exchanged a determined look.
“Ready, set, go!”
At the sound of the whistle, they cautiously moved forward.
Initially, their movements were clumsy, nearly causing them to stumble.
“Watch out!” Noah steadied Sadie by gripping her waist.
Her heartbeat quickened, and a faint blush crept up her cheeks. “Thank you.”
“You’re welcome,” he murmured, his voice low and gentle.

###Chapter 444:
Gradually, they synchronized their paces, gaining confidence and speed.
“Go, Mommy and Daddy!” Averi cheered from the sidelines.
They surged ahead, winning the race by a comfortable margin.
Averi squealed with joy, grabbing the trophy from Betsey and exclaiming, “Mommy, Daddy, we did it!”
Then, beaming, he bolted toward Noah, wrapping his arms around him. “Daddy, you’re the best!”
Sadie froze. She hadn’t expected Averi to call Noah “Daddy” so openly. She instinctively wanted to hush him, but seeing his pure joy, she hesitated.
Conflicting emotions swirled within her.noveldrama
Noah embraced Averi firmly, his deep gaze locked on Sadie, amusement flickering in his expression.
Beyond the kindergarten’s iron fence, Kyla gripped the cold metal tightly, her knuckles turning pale. Her furious stare bored into the trio on the playground. Noah’s commanding presence, Sadie’s warm smile, Averi’s carefree laughter… everything in front of her felt like sharp daggers to the heart.
Vivi stood beside her, arms crossed, smirking at the scene.
“Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a touching sight! Looks like Sadie played her cards well—using her son to tie Noah down. And you, Kyla, the brilliant lawyer, might just end up losing everything,” Vivi said.
Kyla’s head snapped toward her, eyes blazing. “Shut up! This isn’t over. Nothing is set in stone. Noah… Noah would never leave me.”
“Oh? Is that what you think?” Vivi arched an eyebrow, her tone dripping with mockery. “Today, he publicly accepted Averi as his son. He spent the whole day playing with Sadie and the boy, looking every bit the devoted father. Anyone watching would assume they’re a real family.”
She paused before twisting the knife deeper. “And you? What’s your role now? A discarded ex?”
I€?? ￠н?ρтε ?η g?lиσνε.c?m
Kyla’s face drained of color, her lips trembling. “He won’t abandon me! He made a promise…” Her voice broke. She was unable to continue.
Vivi watched Kyla’s distressed expression and felt nothing but satisfaction.
A few hours later, the kindergarten’s event wrapped up. The once-lively atmosphere quieted as families packed up to leave.
Sadie held Averi’s tiny hand, walking alongside Noah. The boy had enjoyed himself thoroughly, his cheeks flushed with excitement as he clutched a handmade toy transformer.
“Mommy, today was amazing! Can we do this again next time?” Averi asked eagerly, skipping along.
“Of course,” Sadie replied warmly, her gaze softening as she took in her son’s happiness.
Just then, her phone buzzed, breaking the moment. She glanced at the screen before stepping aside to take the call.
Averi watched her go, then turned to Noah, his eyes gleaming with curiosity—as if contemplating something important.
After a brief pause, he nodded solemnly, as though making a decision. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a folded piece of paper and a small pencil. Carefully, he scribbled down a series of numbers and handed the paper to Noah.
“This is my phone number,” Averi said in his sweet, childish voice. “You can call me if you need anything.”
He puffed out his small chest in pride, looking unbearably adorable.
Noah glanced at the slip of paper in his hand and felt warmth surge in his chest. He couldn’t help but reach out and ruffle the little boy’s hair. However, at that moment, he caught sight of a delicate figure in the distance.

###Chapter 445:
Kyla was walking toward them with a vulnerable expression, the corners of her eyes red, presumably from crying.
Kyla had witnessed the intimate exchange between Noah and Averi, and instantly felt a wave of jealousy. She was cunning enough to mask it, though.
Noah frowned as she drew closer.
“Noah,” Kyla called softly. “I received the birthday gift you had Samuel send over. I really like it.”noveldrama
She paused for a few seconds before asking, “Do you have some time? I was hoping we could have a meal together, since today is my birthday. Back when we were together, you always celebrated my birthday…”
Kyla’s voice carried a hint of a sob, her eyes wide with expectation.
Meanwhile, Sadie had finished her phone call just in time to overhear Kyla’s words. Her chest tightened with trepidation.
Assuming that Noah would leave with Kyla, Sadie quickly took Averi’s small hand. “You should go,” she said to Noah. “You’ve already been a lot of help today. We won’t keep you any longer.”
Noah didn’t know how to feel. His eyes followed Sadie as she pulled Averi away and began to turn. He opened his mouth to stop her, but the words died in his throat.
His internal conflict did not escape Kyla’s notice. “Sadie,” she said, “why don’t you join us for dinner?” Then, when Sadie didn’t respond, she added softly, “Are you still upset with me? I really didn’t do anything to your grandma…”
Sadie clenched her free hand tightly, her nails digging into her palm.
She whirled around to face Kyla, her tone cold and threatening. “You should be grateful my grandmother is okay. Otherwise, I would stop at nothing to make you pay.”
With that, she picked up Averi and walked away without a backward glance.
ｍ?ｅ ｕｄｔｅｓ ｎ ｌ?ｖｌ.
The air grew increasingly tense as Noah and Kyla were left alone. “Noah,” Kyla said, her eyes shimmering with tears. She looked even more pitiful than she usually did. “Did you really forget about our past?”
Noah turned to her then. He almost got swayed by her words yet again, but reason quickly took over.
“Kyla,” he said in a tone that was gentle but distant at the same time. “I still have work to finish at the office. Let’s have dinner some other time.” He paused to choose his words carefully before adding, “Today… is not the right time.”
Kyla could feel the color drain from her face. She gaped at Noah, unable to believe her ears. “But—But today is my birthday. In the past, you would always…” She choked up and couldn’t finish her sentence.
Noah averted his gaze, suddenly focused on adjusting his cuff. “I should go.”
He didn’t wait for a response before walking away, his strides firm and resolute. Kyla was rooted to the spot as she watched him go. Every step he took felt like a hammer to her heart.
She couldn’t accept this. Why did Sadie get to have everything?
Sadie had Noah’s love and a lovable son, while she was left with nothing.
The resentment that had long since festered within her flared up, and Kyla gnashed her teeth together as her gaze turned fierce. She was going to ruin Sadie, one way or another. And then, she would take what was rightfully hers.
While all of this was going on, Vivi had been standing in the shadows, watching everything unfold. She now sneered at Kyla’s desolate figure. That was just the beginning. The real drama was yet to come.
She intended to watch Kyla and Sadie tear each other apart, then she would swoop in to reap the benefits.
Meanwhile, Noah hurriedly caught up with Sadie and Averi. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 446:
Sadie was walking at a brisk pace, her figure casting long shadows under the streetlights.
Averi nestled himself against her chest, his chubby little face filled with worry.
“Sadie!” Noah called out, his voice tinged with a hint of panic.noveldrama
Sadie slowed to a stop, but she didn’t turn around.
“I need to talk to you,” Noah said, stopping a couple of feet behind her.
Sadie took a deep breath before turning to look at him. “What else do you have to say, Mr. Wall?” she asked coolly.
Noah’s expression darkened. “I will uncover the truth about your grandmother’s heart attack. As for Kyla—”
“Yes, yes, Kyla is your first love. Your one true love, even. So?” Sadie took a deep breath and let it out in a small, defeated sigh. “I’m tired, Noah. Please, just let me go.”
She gathered Averi closer and started to leave, but Noah seized her wrist.
“Sadie, listen to me!” His voice was pleading this time.
But Sadie just shook off his hand as her tears finally fell. “I don’t want to hear a single word from you. It’s over between us, Noah.”
Suddenly, a loud growl from Sadie’s stomach cut through the tense atmosphere.
Her face turned crimson, her embarrassment reaching all the way to her ears.
She wished she could vanish from the spot.
Her stomach had chosen the worst possible moment to betray her.
She awkwardly covered her belly, shooting it a resentful look.
Noah’s previously stern expression softened at the unexpected noise, a faint smile appearing at the corners of his mouth.

He found Sadie’s reaction rather endearing.
Averi, observing the exchange with wide eyes, quickly piped up. “Mommy, are you hungry?” His innocent question broke the awkward silence.
Embarrassed, Sadie nodded, her cheeks flushing even more.
All she wanted was to flee the scene, to put as much distance between herself and Noah as possible.
“Then… Let’s go eat!” Averi said brightly, his eyes shining with excitement.
Sadie instinctively wanted to decline, but meeting her son’s hopeful look made it impossible to refuse.
“Mommy, let’s go have something yummy, okay?” Averi pleaded, tugging at her arm.
With a resigned sigh, Sadie gave in. She couldn’t say no to her son.
“Alright…” she whispered, her voice soft and resigned.
A glint of amusement appeared in Noah’s eyes.
His decision to win Averi’s favor first seemed to be right.
“What would you like to eat?” Noah asked, his voice deep and inviting. He looked at Sadie as he awaited her response.
Sadie kept her gaze lowered, avoiding his eyes. “I… I’m fine with anything,” she muttered.
Her thoughts were too scattered to focus on food choices.
Noah’s expression shifted slightly, a frown forming as he sensed Sadie’s distance.
Turning to Averi, he asked, “What would you like to eat?”
“I want… hmm… I want KFC!” Averi declared eagerly, his eyes alight with anticipation.
“KFC?” Noah frowned deeper. “Choose something else.” He refused without a second thought. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 447:noveldrama
“Why?” Averi’s expression drooped, his disappointment palpable.
“Fast food isn’t the best choice,” Noah explained gently.
“But… but I really want it…” Averi’s voice trembled, his plea tinged with the onset of tears.
It had been ages since he last enjoyed fried chicken and fries, and he was really craving them.
Seeing her son on the verge of tears, Sadie quickly intervened. “It’s okay to have it once in a while.”
She didn’t want to disappoint her son or argue with Noah over something so minor.
Noah’s gaze rested on Sadie’s face, and he felt his resolve melting.
“Alright. Just this once,” he finally said.
“Yay! Mr. Wall, you’re the best!” Averi exclaimed, his excitement bubbling over as he hugged Noah’s leg.
Noah tensed slightly at the unexpected embrace.
The sensation was… unusual.
He looked down at the little boy, his features relaxing into a gentle smile.
As she observed this, Sadie’s emotions tangled inside her.
She was torn, unsure whether to be happy or concerned.
She wanted Averi to bond with Noah but was wary of their ties deepening.
“Let’s go,” Noah said, snapping her out of her reverie.
He took Averi’s hand and led him toward the parking lot.
Silently, Sadie followed, her heart aching with a bittersweet pang.
Your next chapter awaits g?lnσνls?c?m
Noah’s car, a sleek black Rolls-Royce Phantom, stood parked by the curb, its presence a quiet statement of elegance and power.
He opened the door for Averi, then turned to Sadie.
“Get in,” he said, his tone even.
After a moment’s hesitation, Sadie climbed into the car.
The drive was quiet, charged with an unspoken tension.
Only Averi filled the silence, his youthful chatter a stark contrast to the adults’ muteness.
The KFC was alive with noise and activity.
Averi, holding Noah’s hand, pointed excitedly at the menu pictures. “Mr. Wall, I want this! And this! And this!”
Noah listened with a patient nod, his lips curving into a soft smile.
Sadie stood aside, observing quietly.
How perfect things would be if her relationship with Noah were less complicated.
A pang of longing touched her heart.
Once seated by a window, Averi eagerly tore into his meal, his delight evident. “‘Yummy! So yummy!” he said through mouthfuls.
Noah watched the boy’s enthusiastic eating, his expression thoughtful, yet he remained silent.
He took a tentative bite of a burger, his brow furrowing. Was this stuff really that good? He doubted it.
Noah couldn’t understand why Averi liked such food so much.
Seeing Noah’s hesitant look, Sadie burst into laughter.
Noah gave her a quick look but remained silent.
He continued eating his burger quietly, occasionally glancing out the window. Nearby, under a towering tree, a figure lingered silently, seemingly waiting for something.

###Chapter 448:
This figure was Samuel, Noah’s trusted assistant.
With a knowing wink from Noah, Samuel caught on quickly and nodded in acknowledgment.
Once the meal was over, Noah suggested driving Sadie and Averi home.
Sadie hastily refused. “There’s really no need. We’ll manage on our own.” She was cautious about becoming too involved with Noah.
“It’s quite late, and I’d rather you two don’t travel alone at night,” Noah insisted with calm assurance.
“It’s alright. We…” Sadie began, but was cut off by Noah’s resolute interjection.
“I’ll take you home.” His voice left no room for further discussion.
Reluctantly, Sadie consented.
Exiting the restaurant, they headed toward Noah’s car. Upon trying to start the car, Noah found the engine unresponsive.
Noah, feigning confusion, muttered, “What’s wrong with this thing?” Despite multiple attempts, the car remained silent.
“Could it be broken?” Sadie asked.
“That looks to be the case,” Noah said, his expression one of genuine dismay.
Sadie, growing concerned, wondered aloud, “What do we do now?”
“No worries. It’s a short walk to your place from here,” Noah suggested, surveying the surroundings.
Glancing at her watch, Sadie noted the lateness of the hour.
After a brief pause, she agreed. “Okay, walking sounds good.”
“Just one second,” Noah said unexpectedly.

Sadie, puzzled, asked, “What seems to be the problem?”
Noah replied, his voice tinged with concern, “Given the hour, it’s unsafe for you and Averi to walk home alone. Allow me to accompany you until you’re home.” His eyes conveyed true concern.
This unexpected offer left Sadie momentarily speechless.
This behavior was uncharacteristic for the Noah she thought she knew.
Emotions swelled within Sadie.
Facing Noah’s earnest gaze, she found herself at a loss for words.
“I’m not sure about this plan,” Sadie said, her voice wavering.
Noah responded confidently, “Why hesitate? As Averi’s… friend, it’s my responsibility to ensure you both get home safely.” His face bore a look of obvious certainty.
Sadie opened her mouth as if to protest, but then thought better of it.
Reluctantly, she responded, “Okay, fine.”
She grasped Averi’s hand, and together with Noah, they started their walk home. The streetlights cast long shadows of them on the ground.
With one hand in Sadie’s and the other in Noah’s, Averi walked between them, his expression filled with joy.
A subtle smile played on Noah’s lips, his eyes reflecting a trace of contentment.
All of a sudden, Averi halted and said, “Mommy, I’m too tired to walk.”
“I’ll carry you,” Sadie said, bending down swiftly.
“No, allow me,” Noah interjected, lifting Averi into his arms effortlessly.
“Thank you, Mr. Wall,” Averi sweetly expressed his gratitude.
Noah replied with a gentle voice, “You’re welcome.” Continuing their journey, he carried Averi.

###Chapter 449:
Eventually, they reached Sadie’s apartment building.
“Alright, you can go up now. I’m leaving,” said Noah.
“Okay,” Sadie responded, beginning to enter the building.
“Hold on, Sadie,” Noah halted her.
Turning, Sadie inquired, “Is there something else?”
Noah, with a hint of embarrassment, asked, “I’m a bit thirsty. May I come up for a glass of water?”
This caught Sadie off guard.
She hadn’t anticipated such a request from Noah.
Wasn’t this a bit too much?noveldrama
Sadie’s expression grew stern.
“You should head home, Mr. Wall. It’s late,” she said, her voice cold. Observing Sadie’s aloof demeanor, Noah felt a sting of disappointment.
Yet, he persisted.
“After walking you home, I think I’ve at least earned a glass of water, don’t you agree? Is that too much to ask?” he argued, his voice tinged with reproach.
Confronted with Noah’s seemingly pitiful look, Sadie felt her annoyance rise.
She held back her frustration and asked, “Mr. Wall, what are you really after?”
“Just a glass of water, as I said,” Noah replied, his face the picture of innocence.
Gazing into his earnest eyes, Sadie found her resolve softening.
“Fine, come up,” she replied, leading the way to the elevator and pressing the button.
Behind her, Noah’s lips twisted into a satisfied grin as he followed swiftly.
Uncover new worlds at g alnov els ;com
Inside the elevator, the silence between Sadie and Noah made the air tense and uncomfortable.
Outside the building, Samuel shivered as the cold wind hit him.
Occasionally, he glanced toward Sadie’s apartment window, his mind swirling with bewilderment.
“To go as far as sabotaging his own car just for more time with his wife? What time is it anyway? Mr. Wall is truly pulling out all the stops. And I’ve also gone to great lengths for Mr. Wall’s happiness. It’s so cold. Why hasn’t Mr. Wall come back down? What’s taking so long?”
As the cold wind persisted, Samuel drew his coat tighter around himself, grumbling inwardly.
His gaze fixed on the elevator doors, he awaited Noah’s return with growing impatience.
The life of a CEO’s special assistant was indeed a challenging one.
The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime. Sadie was the first to step out, followed closely by Noah, who was carrying Averi in his arms.
As soon as they entered the apartment, Averi wiggled free and dashed into the living room. “Mr. Wall, look! This is my building block castle.”
Noah’s gaze followed the direction of the little boy’s stubby finger, landing on the complex-looking castle made of colorful blocks in the corner of the living room. It stood nearly as tall as an adult.
“Wow! That’s amazing!” Noah’s praise was genuine, his voice filled with the right amount of surprise and admiration. “Did you build that all by yourself?”
“Uh-huh!” Averi nodded, his eyes sparkling with pride. “And over there! Look, Mr. Wall! Look at my drawings.”
He pulled Noah over to the wall, where several vibrant drawings were displayed. Noah knelt down to get a better look. The wall was adorned with childlike sketches of flowers, trees, and imaginative depictions of the universe, as well as one drawing of a family of three, holding hands in a park. 
.
.

###Chapter 450:
Noah felt a pang in his heart. He pointed to the last drawing and asked, “Is this you, your mom, and your dad?”
Averi nodded at first, then shook his head. “It’s my wish. I wish my mommy and daddy and I can always be together.”
Sadness clouded the boy’s cheerful expression.
Noah felt the weight of Averi’s words like a blow to the chest. He glanced over at Sadie, who was standing to the side with a tight expression. She immediately looked away, no doubt avoiding his gaze.
Noah turned his attention back to Averi. “Your wish will definitely come true,” he said with a smile.
“Really?” Averi exclaimed, his face lighting up again.
“Of course. As long as you behave and do well in school, your mommy and daddy will love you very much.”
Sadie tensed when she heard that. She couldn’t resist calling out in a warning tone, “Noah—”
“Averi.” Noah smoothly cut her off. “Can I play building blocks with you?”
“Of course!” The little boy clapped his hands with glee and pulled Noah toward his castle.
Sadie’s emotions were in turmoil as she watched them interact. Part of her knew that Noah was simply putting on an act, yet she couldn’t deny the other part of her that longed for moments like this—the part that wished time would stop so they could remain this way.
Noah took the opportunity to study the entire apartment. It was a two-bedroom unit with old furniture, a sofa with worn patches, and a desk in the corner piled high with design sketches and various professional books. Every corner of this apartment was a testament to the fact that Sadie’s life had been far from easy. The realization brought another pang to Noah’s heart. He couldn’t even begin to imagine how she had managed these past few years, raising a child on her own while building her career.
“Averi, will you play by yourself for a bit? I need to talk to your mom.” Noah excused himself and walked over to Sadie, who stood by the window, watching the city lights outside, seemingly lost in her thoughts.
“What are you thinking about?” Noah asked softly, sidling up next to her. His voice jolted Sadie back to her senses.
“Nothing,” she muttered, throwing a brief glance his way.
“Are you still mad at me?” Noah asked gently.
Sadie said nothing.
He knew then that she was still harboring a grudge over recent events. Noah sighed. “I know you’re still upset with me. But I had my reasons three years ago.”
“Reasons?” Sadie scoffed. “So you’re saying you were justified in teaming up with Kyla to deceive me and hurt my family?”
“That’s not it—I never intended to hurt you or your family.”
“Then tell me, what really happened back then?” Sadie’s voice rose with her emotions. “What made you investigate the car accident? And why did you hide it from me?”noveldrama
Noah hesitated, biting back the words that were already on the tip of his tongue.
“Well?” Sadie demanded sharply. “Why aren’t you saying anything? You don’t actually have a reasonable explanation, right? You were just lying to me.”
“Sadie, please trust me. I’m not lying to you.” Noah’s eyes were filled with sincerity. “It’s just that… there are certain things I can’t tell you right now.”
“Is that so?” Sadie asked sarcastically, almost laughing at his face. “Just what do you take me for, Noah? A child?”
“Enough! I don’t want to hear any more of your lies. I already told you—it’s over between us. Stop showing up in my life from now on.”

###Chapter 451:
“Sadie, I know you hate me, but—”noveldrama
“I said, stop talking!” Sadie’s breath grew heavy with rage. “I don’t want to waste any more of my time on you. Please leave. You are not welcome here.”
“What’s wrong, Mommy?” Having heard the commotion, Averi ran over from the living room. He looked up at the adults, his cute little face filled with concern.
“It’s nothing, sweetheart.” Sadie’s voice softened as she mustered a strained smile. “Mommy was just talking to Mr. Wall.”
“Okay,” Averi said slowly, bobbing his head, though he barely understood what was going on.
Noah could only swallow the lump of emotion lodged in his throat.
Noah knew there was no point in arguing further.
“Fine. I’m leaving.” His eyes lingered on Sadie, filled with unspoken emotion. “But remember this—I won’t give up on you.”
With that, he turned on his heel and walked out.
Sadie stood frozen, watching his silhouette disappear. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she could no longer hold them back. They spilled down her cheeks in streams.
She sank to the floor, clutching Averi tightly as sobs racked her body.
“Mommy, what’s wrong?” Averi’s small hands patted her back hesitantly. “Please don’t cry…”
“I’m okay, sweetheart…” Sadie forced a weak smile, trying to steady her voice. But the tears kept falling.
Just then, chaos erupted outside.
“Sadie Hudson, get out here!”
“You home-wrecking witch! You stole my man, and I’ll make sure you regret it!” The night was shattered by angry voices and cruel accusations.

Sadie wiped her face, her expression hardening. She recognized the voice. It was Kyla, cursing.
“Stay here, baby,” she murmured to Averi before rising to her feet and striding toward the door.
Downstairs, Kyla stood with a small crowd, hostility radiating from them.
Sadie’s eyes narrowed. “What do you want, Kyla?”
Kyla scoffed, folding her arms. “What do I want? You really have the nerve to ask that? You shameless snake. How dare you seduce Noah? You need to be taught a lesson.”
Sadie let out a bitter laugh. “Seduce him? Have you lost your mind? Whatever was between Noah and me ended ages ago. Stop making up stories.”
“Ended?” Kyla’s expression twisted with fury.
“Do you think I’d believe that? You can’t stand to see me happy. You want to take everything from me!”
Sadie’s jaw tightened. “Take from you? Kyla, don’t play the victim. You were the one who took everything from me. You even nearly made me lose my grandmother!”
“I did no such thing!” Kyla shot back, her voice rising. “Whatever happened, you brought it on yourself!”
Sadie exhaled sharply. “You know the truth. You just don’t want to admit it.” She stepped forward, her tone unwavering. “This is my last warning, Kyla. Leave now, or deal with the consequences.”
Kyla let out a mocking laugh. “Oh? And what exactly are you going to do? Do you think I’m scared of you? Today, I’ll show you what happens when you cross me.”
With that, her eyes flicked to the group behind her. “Teach her a lesson!” At her command, the crowd surged toward Sadie.
But before they could reach her, a tall figure stepped in front of her, shielding her completely.

###Chapter 452:
“I dare you to lay a finger on her!” Noah’s voice was icy and authoritative, leaving no room for doubt.
His sharp gaze swept over the aggressors, his mere presence enough to make them hesitate. Those who had been aggressive moments ago shivered involuntarily under Noah’s gaze and stopped in their tracks.
Kyla’s face drained of color instantly.
“N-Noah?” Her voice trembled. “Why are you here?”
“If I hadn’t shown up, would you have torn this place apart?” Noah’s voice was frigid, void of any warmth.
Kyla opened her mouth but found herself at a loss for words.
Noah’s tone darkened. “This is your last warning. Stay away from Sadie. Next time, you won’t get off so easily.”
Kyla trembled, knowing full well he wasn’t bluffing. Gritting her teeth, she spun on her heel.
“Let’s go!” Kyla stormed off with her followers, humiliated.
As soon as they disappeared, Noah turned back to Sadie. Seeing how pale she looked, something flickered in his eyes—something almost like pain.
“Are you alright?” he asked softly.
Sadie nodded. “I’m fine.”
Noah hesitated before murmuring, “I should have come sooner.”
“This isn’t your fault.” She inhaled deeply, pushing down the whirlwind of emotions. “Still… thank you.”
Noah’s gaze softened. “Do we really need to say that to each other?”
Sadie looked away, unable to meet his eyes. A simple “thank you” could never solve the complexity between them. She wanted to run, to put distance between them before she got pulled in too deep.
 ?  .
But Noah’s presence, his unwavering gaze, wrapped around her like an invisible force, making escape impossible. And she knew—beneath all his kindness, there was danger. Kyla’s insanity, Isabel’s cruelty, and most of all… Noah’s uncertain heart.
With deliberate steps, Sadie entered the elevator, her thoughts a chaotic swirl. She gripped the handrail tightly, her knuckles turning white under the pressure. She constantly reminded herself to stay composed and think logically. She couldn’t afford to fall for Noah again.
Upon reaching her apartment, Sadie quickly locked the door, shutting herself away in her small space.
Outside the building, Noah remained motionless, his gaze fixed on the path she had taken. He stood there, lost in thought. Exhaustion and regret forced a heavy sigh from his lips.
For him and Sadie, there was no path to reconciliation. The wounds from three years ago had carved a deep divide between them. Despite his efforts, the pain Sadie had endured still lingered.
Noah pulled out his phone and called Samuel.
“Samuel, I need you to assign people to watch over Sadie. Make sure she stays safe.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded dutifully.noveldrama
Even after hanging up, Noah’s mood remained heavy. His mind wandered back to the warnings from years ago, echoes of advice that now haunted him. “Noah, you’ll regret this. You’ll regret losing Sadie forever.” At the time, he had brushed them off, laughing at the thought.
Now, he couldn’t deny the truth. The regret was profound.
Had he not misjudged Sadie three years ago, had he not driven her away, Averi might have been his child, and they could have been a happy family.

###Chapter 453:
But life doesn’t bend to “if only.”
His opportunity was lost, and the past was irreversible.
A rueful smile appeared on Noah’s face as he turned to walk down the road.
But soon, he was abruptly stopped by a figure.
Under the glow of a streetlamp stood Kyla, her expression ghostly and sorrowful.
“Why are you here?” Noah asked, his tone cold and detached.
“I just wanted to explain what happened. I didn’t mean to…” Kyla’s voice shook, her eyes brimming with tears.
Noah interjected sharply, “Stop. I don’t want to listen to any excuses.” He tried to move past her, but Kyla, persistent, grabbed his sleeve.
“Please stay, Noah. Hear me out…”
Noah abruptly pulled his arm away, causing Kyla to lose her balance and fall to the cold ground.
“Ouch!” she exclaimed, hitting the pavement, her hand scraping against it and starting to bleed.
“How could you do this to me?” Kyla looked up at Noah, tears streaking down her face, her voice a shaky mix of pain and desperation. Noah’s expression remained cold as he looked down at her.
Feeling his cold stare, Kyla shivered, her complexion growing paler.
“Noah, I admit my mistakes. I was wrong to treat Sadie that way. It’s just that my love for you is so strong, I feared I might lose you…” Her words faded to a whisper.
“Love for me?” Noah scoffed dismissively.
“Noah…” Kyla attempted to continue, but he interjected. “Kyla, let’s be clear. If you hadn’t saved my life once, do you really think you’d still be here? You would have been gone a long time ago.”
Your next chapter is here gα?ησνs?com
Kyla felt as though a knife had pierced her heart at his words.
Her face turned even paler, and her lips quivered, but she found herself speechless. She was determined not to let the situation spiral out of control. There had to be a solution.
“Noah… I’m pleading with you, please don’t do this.” Kyla’s voice faltered as she pleaded with him. “I’ll go away. You won’t have to deal with me again.” Noah’s expression shifted, his eyebrows knitting together in mild surprise.
“Really, I’ll go. You have my word,” Kyla said vigorously, almost as if she feared he doubted her sincerity.
“You need to assure me you’ll never show your face to me or Sadie again,” Noah demanded.noveldrama
“I give you my word. I swear it,” Kyla replied, her voice shaking with earnestness.
Pausing briefly, she looked up at Noah warily. “And one more thing…” She hesitated before continuing, “About the International Jewelry Design Competition, could you possibly… Could you consider letting my friend Vivi win?”
Noah was taken aback by the request. Unaware that Sadie was also a competitor, he casually consented. “Proceed as you wish. It’s merely a minor contest.”
He considered the outcome of the competition trivial compared to his primary concern: Sadie’s well-being.
“Thank you, Noah. Thank you so much…” Kyla’s face brightened as she repeatedly expressed her gratitude.
Without saying a word, Noah turned and walked away, not looking back. As he left, Kyla’s gaze lingered on him, her face soon twisting into a slight, sinister smirk.
“So, Sadie, you think you’ve won, huh?” she murmured to herself. “If I can’t be with Noah, I’ll make sure you won’t be either.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 454:
Standing up, Kyla wiped away her tears and straightened her attire. She then retrieved her phone and dialed Vivi.
“I’ve taken care of it. Noah has given his approval. You’re set to win the contest…”
Back at his car, Noah slumped into his seat, closed his eyes, and let the fatigue wash over him.
At the stately Howe Manor, the grand redwood doors, carved with intricate designs, stood firmly closed, radiating a sense of age-old sophistication.
In the living room, Alex stood tensely, gripping his car keys, a look of urgency on his face.
“Mom, I need to leave. There’s a pile of work waiting for me at the company,” he said, his voice edged with impatience.noveldrama
His mother, Susannah, was seated across the room on an elegant sofa, dressed in a dark red ensemble. Her hair was swept up neatly, and her wrist was adorned with a jade bracelet—symbols of her refined and privileged lifestyle. However, today, her usual poise was replaced with a look of concern. With a gentle sigh, her voice carried a mix of weariness and exasperation.
“Alex, why must you be so headstrong? Do you think I would deceive you? I felt a tightness in my chest when I woke up, which is why I asked you to come back.”
“Mom!” Alex raised his voice slightly. “If you’re really not well, shouldn’t you be at the hospital instead of calling me back here?” Susannah’s expression darkened a touch. She placed her glass of water on the table with a soft “clink,” watching the surface ripple quietly.
“I didn’t want to cause you undue worry. Just having you here reassures me,” she replied, her tone softening.
Alex studied his mother, understanding her motives clearly. Susannah was not sick; she had merely lured him back under false pretenses.
“Mom, let’s cut to the chase. You had me come here because of Sadie, didn’t you?” Alex stated bluntly.
€$t ￠?αρ?ёя? 1π [dot]com
For a moment, Susannah’s face stiffened, but then she regained her composure. Realizing her son had seen through her ruse, she dropped the pretense.
“Alex, you have feelings for Sadie, I understand, but… she has a child. Our family’s standing could be compromised if this becomes public.”
“Mom!” Alex cut her off, his voice filled with irritation. “What is the issue with Sadie? She’s independent, earning her way honestly. She’s done nothing to deserve scorn. What right do you have to judge her?”
“I’m not judging her,” Susannah replied, attempting to justify her stance. However, the protective expression on Alex’s face made it clear he was immovable.
“Mom, I’m telling you this for the last time. Stay out of my personal affairs,” Alex responded firmly.
“You… you’re trying to give me a heart attack!” Susannah exclaimed, dramatically clutching her chest, her face a picture of anguish and despair.
When Alex saw his mother so visibly upset, his demeanor softened.
“Mom, please…” His voice became tender. “I’ll make sure to visit more. Will that help?”
Susannah looked at her son, acutely aware that his reassurances were merely to comfort her. She was powerless to sway him. He had always been stubborn, and once his decision was made, it was final.
“Alex, I’m not asking for much,” Susannah said, her voice tinged with soft desperation. “I just don’t want you to make a decision you’ll regret.”
Alex paused for a brief moment, then nodded in acknowledgment. “I get it, Mom. But I really need to leave now.”
He then turned and began walking toward the door.
“Alex!” Susannah called after him urgently.
He halted his steps and looked back toward her.

###Chapter 455:noveldrama
“Isn’t today Parents’ Day at the kindergarten Sadie’s child attends?” Susannah inquired cautiously.
Alex tensed up unexpectedly. His mother’s mention of the event caught him off guard.
“It is,” he answered, his voice devoid of emotion.
“Were you going to participate?” Susannah asked.
Alex remained silent, his gaze fixed on his mother.
Susannah interpreted his look and felt a twinge of unease. “Alex, I understand you’re upset with me, but I was only trying to…”
“Mom, please.” Alex interjected sharply. “I’m not upset. Just… disappointed.” With that, he left the manor, not once glancing back.
Susannah remained motionless on the sofa, her eyes following Alex until he disappeared from view. Tears began to stream down her face.
“I’m doing this for his own good…” she muttered to herself, struggling with her emotions. “Why must it be so hard?”
Alex’s car sped away, vanishing down the roadway.
That night, Susannah was left to wrestle with her thoughts, unable to find sleep. She tossed and turned in her bed, the silk covers in disarray around her, haunted by visions of her son’s determined stride and Sadie’s challenging stare. With a heavy sigh, Susannah sat up, grabbed her coat, and moved toward the window. The night enveloped everything, with the streetlights casting soft glows into the surrounding darkness.
She massaged her temples, overwhelmed by the chaos in her mind.
Alex, her only son, had been the apple of her eye since birth, always protected from hardship. Yet now, he was ready to defy her for a woman who already had a child. The more she thought about it, the greater her disappointment and distress became, bringing tears to her eyes.
“I cannot let this stand,” she whispered, clenching her jaw, her expression hardening with resolve.
Le$? ΔTR? 1π lnovels.cm
“Sadie, I must meet you myself and see what magic you’ve cast over my son.”
Determined, Susannah planned an early visit to Sadie the following morning.
Susannah was the mistress of the Howe household, and she firmly believed that she could handle a single mother. Despite Alex’s affection for Sadie, she would never consent to their relationship. But what if Alex persisted? Susannah thought about his stubbornness and reconsidered.
She exhaled deeply, beginning to devise a strategy. Maybe a little give-and-take could work for both of them. If Sadie were willing to let go of her child and become part of the Howe family, it could be possible after all.
The following morning, Sadie was holding a trash bag in one hand and Averi’s tiny hand in the other, preparing to take him to kindergarten.
“Mommy, can I have two ice creams today?” Averi looked up at Sadie with hopeful eyes.
“No, you can have just one, sweetheart,” Sadie answered, playfully squeezing his little nose.
“You’re so mean, Mommy!” Averi pouted.
Sadie laughed softly, saying nothing further.
As they neared the road, an unexpected figure appeared in their path.
“Miss Hudson, may we have a word?” Susannah stood next to a black vehicle, addressing Sadie with a polite, yet firm tone.
Sadie was taken aback, not expecting to run into Alex’s mother here. “Mrs. Howe, what brings you here?” she asked, startled and somewhat uncomfortable.
Averi eyed Susannah curiously, unsure of who the well-dressed woman was. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 456:
Susannah’s eyes lingered on Averi briefly before shifting back to Sadie.
“Miss Hudson, I’m here to discuss you and Alex,” she said bluntly.
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat, and she had a strong sense of what Susannah’s intentions were.
“Mrs. Howe, I think you’re mistaken. There’s nothing between Mr. Howe and me…” Sadie tried to clarify, but Susannah cut her off.
“You don’t need to explain, Miss Hudson. I’m not here to cause trouble.” Susannah’s voice remained calm, but it carried undeniable authority.noveldrama
“I just want to make it clear that Alex is my only child, and I want him to be happy. However, I cannot approve of your relationship.”
She paused before adding, “Of course, I’m not unreasonable. If you’re willing to part with this child, I might still consider allowing you to marry Alex.”
The impact of Susannah’s words hit Sadie like a shockwave.
Sadie blinked, barely processing what had just been said.
“Mrs. Howe, what did you just say?” she asked, sure she had misunderstood.
“I said, if you’re prepared to let go of this child, I might allow you to marry Alex,” Susannah repeated, her voice even firmer.
Sadie felt a surge of frustration. She clenched her fists, trying to contain her emotions.
“Mrs. Howe, I believe you’re confused. Mr. Howe and I are only friends. As for Averi, he is my world, and there’s no way I would ever give him up.”
Susannah’s expression grew more serious; she hadn’t expected Sadie to be so resolute.
“Miss Hudson, you should reconsider. As a single mother with a child, what future awaits you? Becoming part of our family would assure you wealth and security. Why turn that down?” she asked, trying to tempt Sadie with the promise of material wealth.
Sadie scoffed, finding Susannah’s arguments ridiculous.
L?tеst chαpt?rs in glnovels.m
“Mrs. Howe, your offer means nothing to me. I don’t need assistance to raise Averi. Please leave—there’s nothing further to discuss.”
With that, Sadie grabbed Averi’s hand and walked around Susannah, making her way to the road.
Susannah stood, watching them walk away, her face darkening with rage.
“Fine! You turn down a good opportunity, and you’ll have to face the consequences,” she muttered through clenched teeth, turning back to her car.
“If you’re going to be this stubborn, don’t blame me for what happens next!” Susannah spat, her jaw tightening.
Just then, a moving truck entered the residential area, cruising slowly. Inside the vehicle, Vivi sat in the front seat, her eyes narrowing as she watched the scene unfold outside. A sly grin spread across her lips.
“Well, well, what a spectacle,” she muttered with a mocking tone. “Who would have guessed? Sadie certainly knows how to play her cards. Not only has she ensnared Noah, but now Alex is completely smitten. And now, Alex’s own mother has stepped in? What a turn of events!” Jealousy and resentment laced Vivi’s words.
To her, Sadie had always been a nuisance—someone she wished would just disappear. But now, watching her rival thrive while she struggled was unbearable.
Turning to the driver, Vivi motioned toward a nearby apartment building. “Pull over right there,” she instructed coolly.
The choice to move into this particular neighborhood wasn’t by chance—she knew Noah frequented the area. Creating opportunities to “accidentally” run into him was all part of her plan to win him over.
However, she hadn’t expected to stumble upon such an intense confrontation on her first day here. Rather than discouraging her, the scene only fueled her determination. Her eyes gleamed with cold resolve. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 457:
“Sadie, your downfall is inevitable,” she muttered under her breath. “Soon, your reputation will be ruined, and everything you hold dear will slip through your fingers. Just wait and see.”
The truck came to a stop. Vivi stepped out, tilting her chin upward as she gazed at the upscale building before her. A smug satisfaction curled at the corners of her mouth.
She was certain it wouldn’t take long for her to destroy Sadie’s life and take everything that should be hers, including Noah.
After dropping Averi off at kindergarten, Sadie went to her studio, but an uneasy feeling gnawed at her all day.noveldrama
“Nanette, how’s the progress on the design?” Sadie inquired, massaging her temples as she glanced at Nanette, who stood nearby.
Nanette, carrying a thick folder, let out a relieved sigh. “Everything’s been finalized. We’re just waiting on your last review.”
Galaxy was Sadie’s labor of love, a necklace she had meticulously crafted for the upcoming International Jewelry Design Competition. Every detail mattered. Taking the folder, Sadie carefully examined the sketches and notes inside. “Looks good,” she remarked approvingly. “The deadline is fast approaching. We can’t afford any errors.”
Nanette nodded with determination. “Understood. I’ll submit the finalized version first thing in the morning.”
With a satisfied nod, Sadie issued a few more instructions before allowing Nanette to return to work.
As the office settled into silence, she leaned back in her chair, exhaling deeply. The exhausting workload of the past few days had taken its toll.
The upcoming launch of the Galaxy collection stirred an eager excitement within her. She was convinced that with Galaxy, she would stand out at the International Jewelry Design Competition and completely overshadow Vivi.
As dusk settled, the city skyline flickered with countless glowing lights. Nanette, having worked overtime, packed up her things and prepared to head home.

Just as she exited the office and reached for a shared bike, a red sports car screeched to a sudden stop right in front of her.
The tinted window slid down gradually, revealing a breathtaking face.
It was Kyla.
Though she wore oversized sunglasses that concealed most of her features, Nanette recognized her instantly.
“Miss… Miss Wade?” Nanette stammered, caught between shock and unease.
Kyla removed her shades, exposing a pair of captivating eyes. She studied Nanette carefully, a faint yet unreadable smile gracing her lips. “You’re Nanette, aren’t you?” Her voice was soft and sugary, but beneath it lurked an unmistakable chill.
A nervous jolt ran through Nanette. Why was Kyla here?
“Y-Yes, that’s me,” she murmured, lowering her gaze, afraid to meet Kyla’s piercing stare.
“I heard… your mother got into serious trouble with gambling debts and was nearly beaten to death. She’s still in the ICU, isn’t she?” Kyla’s tone was light, as though she were speaking about something insignificant.
But to Nanette, it felt like a thunderclap. Her entire body stiffened, and her eyes widened in shock. She gaped at Kyla in disbelief. “H-How do you know that?” Her voice quivered with fear.
Nanette had concealed her mother’s financial crisis and hospitalization from everyone, even Sadie. So how had Kyla found out?
Kyla chuckled but didn’t offer an explanation. Instead, she reached into her designer handbag and pulled out a check, waving it teasingly in front of Nanette.
“Fifty thousand. Enough to cover the hospital bills?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 458:
Nanette’s gaze locked onto the check, longing and desperation reflected in her eyes. To her, fifty thousand was an enormous sum. With that money, her mother’s medical expenses would be covered—no more humiliating pleas, no more borrowing from others. Yet, she knew generosity rarely came without conditions.
If Kyla was offering this, there had to be a catch.
“Miss Wade… what exactly do you want?” she asked warily, forcing down the flicker of hope in her chest.
Kyla stepped out of her car, pressed the check into Nanette’s trembling fingers, and leaned in, her voice a soft murmur in Nanette’s ear. “It’s simple. I need you to do something for me.”
Her voice was low, almost hypnotic.
“What is it?” Nanette’s pulse quickened, an uneasy feeling creeping over her.
“I want you…” Kyla deliberately paused, then enunciated each syllable with chilling precision. “To hand over Sadie’s design draft.”
Nanette’s face turned ghostly pale. She instinctively stepped back, the check fluttering to the ground.
“No… Absolutely not!” Nanette cried, her voice laced with fear as she shook her head frantically. “I can’t do that!”
Sadie had been the only one to believe in her talent when no one else would. How could she possibly betray that trust? Besides, taking the draft without permission wasn’t just immoral—it was a crime. If she got caught, her entire future would be destroyed.
Kyla scoffed at Nanette’s reaction, her gaze cold and calculating. “You might want to reconsider. Your mother is still in the hospital, isn’t she? And her fate… well, it’s entirely in your hands.”
Nanette’s whole body trembled, her heart caught in a merciless tug-of-war. On one side stood Sadie—the person who had given her a chance and placed faith in her. On the other was her mother, clinging desperately to life in a hospital bed. How was she supposed to make that choice?
Kyla’s smirk widened as she savored Nanette’s torment. The deeper Nanette’s distress, the more satisfaction Kyla seemed to derive from it.

The night was pitch black. However, Sadie’s studio was as bright as day. She rubbed her sore temples and shifted her gaze from the computer screen.noveldrama
“Carol went to pick up Averi tonight,” she murmured, a smile curving her lips. With Carol looking after Averi, she could finally focus on her work, feeling a kind of happiness.
“Knock. Knock. Knock…” A sudden knock at the door broke the silence. “Who could it be?” Sadie frowned, assuming it was her delivery, and rose to open the door.
“Come in, please,” she called, pulling the door open.
But it wasn’t the delivery guy at the doorway; it was Nanette, who had unexpectedly returned. Nanette stood there, her head lowered, her body trembling. Her face was pale, her eyes red and swollen as if she had been crying. She looked distressed, a stark contrast to her usual poised self.
Sadie froze, having never seen Nanette like this. A sense of foreboding filled her, and her heart sank.
“Nanette? What’s wrong?” she asked, her voice trembling as she stepped forward, her concern clear. “What happened?”
Nanette slowly lifted her head. “Sa… Sadie…” Her voice was so hoarse it was barely audible. She opened her mouth to speak, but the words wouldn’t come.
Sadie’s heart clenched. She sensed something serious had happened. “Nanette, don’t be afraid. Tell me, what’s going on?”
Nanette’s tears finally overcame her restraint. As they cascaded down her cheeks, she faced Sadie, her lips quivering, struggling to find the words. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 459:
“Nanette, don’t cry. Take your time. No matter what’s happened, I’m here for you,” Sadie reassured her, gently patting her back.
Her words seemed to comfort Nanette a little.
“Sadie…” Nanette finally said, her voice still raspy. “I’m sorry…”
Sadie’s heart jolted.
An hour later, Kyla lounged in her luxurious villa, sipping red wine. She wore a silk robe, her flawless skin and long legs enhancing her allure.
“Ding…” The chime of a text message interrupted the silence. Kyla placed her wine glass on the table, grabbed her phone, and glanced at the screen nonchalantly.
The message was from Nanette, concise yet profound. “Miss Wade, I’m willing to work with you.”
A smug smile crept across Kyla’s face. She had known all along Nanette wouldn’t refuse her.
“Sadie, just you wait! The real show has just begun,” she whispered, setting her phone down and once more picking up her wine glass, the liquid swirling elegantly.
Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office of Wall Group, Noah stood by a floor-to-ceiling window, whiskey glass in hand, staring into the blackness outside. Documents piled on his desk awaited his attention, but his mind wandered.noveldrama
“Damn it!” he muttered, gulping down the whiskey.
It scorched his throat but failed to quell his frustration. Annoyed, he loosened his tie and unbuttoned the top of his shirt, exposing his collarbones and the firm lines of his chest.
Compelled by a sudden urge, he snatched his car keys and exited the office. His black Maybach sliced through the night, halting on the road beside Sadie’s neighborhood.
From the driver’s seat, Noah looked up at Sadie’s window, where a warm light flickered in the darkness, stirring something within him.
?@? @t?è íń .
“What am I doing?” He scoffed at himself, a bitter laugh escaping his lips. “I’m like a lovesick teenager.”
He was ready to drive away when a movement caught his eye—a familiar figure not far away.
Vivi? What was she doing here?
His brows knitted together as he rolled down the window for a clearer view.
Vivi was maneuvering a shopping cart laden with household items when her foot suddenly slipped, sending her tumbling forward.
“Ouch!” she exclaimed, crashing to the ground as her belongings scattered around her.
“Well, that’s what you get,” Noah remarked coldly, preparing to look away.
Just then, Vivi lifted her head and saw Noah. Their eyes met, and for a fleeting second, surprise flashed across Vivi’s face. Quickly, she scrambled to her feet, brushing off her clothes and hastily smoothing down her tousled hair. She strode toward Noah’s car with a radiant smile.
Leaning slightly against the car window, she flashed him a bright, saccharine grin. “Mr. Wall, do you live around here too? What a small world.”
Noah’s expression remained unreadable, his gaze sharp and indifferent. A shiver of unease curled in Vivi’s stomach, but she refused to let it show. She tilted her head, feigning innocence. “So… are you here to visit someone?” She let the question linger, her voice dripping with meaning, as if she already knew the answer.
Noah barely spared her a glance before his voice cut through the air like a blade. “That’s none of your concern.”
Without another word, he pressed the button, and the car window slid up, shutting her out in one seamless, dismissive motion.
Vivi’s smile wavered, then vanished. She clenched her jaw, biting her lip to keep the sting of humiliation at bay. 
.

###Chapter 460:
Noah spared Vivi not a second glance. He drove through the gates of the residential complex, his focus unshaken, his mind set. The car eased to a stop outside the building where Sadie lived, but he made no move to step out.
Instead, he sat in silence, his gaze locked onto the illuminated window of her apartment. The glow from inside spilled faintly onto the night, steady and warm. Yet, no shadows flickered; no sign of movement stirred behind the curtains.
A quiet unease crept into his chest. “What is she doing?”
For a long moment, he hesitated, but the gnawing sense of something unspoken finally pushed him into action. He stepped out of the car, the night air cool against his skin, and made his way to the elevator.
Pressing the doorbell, he waited. The chime cut through the hush of the late hour, the only sound in the stillness. Seconds stretched, heavy and slow. Then, at last, the door cracked open. But it wasn’t Sadie. Carol stood in the doorway, blinking up at him, her surprise unmistakable.
“Mr… Mr. Wall?” Her voice wavered slightly. She was caught between confusion and curiosity. “What brings you here?”
Noah’s eyes barely lingered on her. Instead, they flickered past her shoulder, scanning the apartment. His voice was low, firm. “Where’s Sadie?”
“Sadie is…” Carol faltered, her voice unsteady. “She’s… not home.”
Noah’s expression darkened. His brows knitted together. “Not home? At this hour? Where did she go?”
Carol averted her gaze, her hesitation speaking louder than words.
Just then, a small, excited voice rang out from inside the apartment. “Mr. Wall!”
Noah froze. His sharp gaze softened instantly as he turned toward the sound. Standing in the living room, eyes bright with delight, was Averi.
“Hey, Averi!” A rare smile curved Noah’s lips as he strode forward, scooping the boy effortlessly into his arms.noveldrama

Averi giggled, wrapping his tiny arms around Noah’s neck in an affectionate squeeze. “What are you doing here, Mr. Wall?”
Noah ruffled the boy’s hair, his smile lingering. “I came to see you because I’ve missed you.”
Averi beamed. “I’ve missed you too!” He planted a small, warm kiss on Noah’s cheek, his laughter bubbling with pure joy.
Carol stood to the side, watching the exchange with a conflicted expression. She opened her mouth as if to speak, but hesitated, uncertainty flickering across her face.
Then, suddenly—her phone rang.
She was startled by the sound, fumbling to answer. As she listened, her face quickly drained of color.
“What?” Her voice tightened. “Alright… I understand. I’ll be there right away.” Ending the call, she turned back to Noah, visibly tense. “Mr. Wall, I’m so sorry, but there’s an emergency at my home—I have to leave immediately.”
Noah glanced between her and Averi, his expression unreadable. “What about him?”
Carol hesitated. Then, gathering herself, she looked at him pleadingly. “Mr. Wall, could you watch over Averi for a little while? Please… I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
Without hesitation, Noah gave a firm nod. “Go. I’ve got this. Don’t worry.”
Relief flooded Carol’s face. “Thank you so much, Mr. Wall. I really appreciate it.” After rattling off a few hurried instructions, she grabbed her things and rushed out the door.
Now, it was just Noah and Averi.
The little boy tilted his head, blinking up at Noah with wide, curious eyes. “Mr. Wall, are you hungry?”
It was only then that Noah realized the emptiness gnawing at his stomach—he hadn’t eaten dinner yet.

###Chapter 461:
He rubbed his stomach absently and let out a low chuckle. “I suppose I am.”
Averi’s face lit up with excitement. “Then… can you cook?”
Noah stilled.
The expectant sparkle in Averi’s eyes made it impossible to ignore the question. “Mr. Wall, you can cook, right? I really want to taste something you make.”
Noah exhaled slowly. He wasn’t exactly a chef, but when he was faced with that hopeful gaze, refusing wasn’t an option.
Taking a deep breath, he rolled up his sleeves. “Alright. I’ll give it a shot.” With that, he marched into the kitchen, fully aware that he was stepping onto dangerous ground.
A short while later, he emerged—with a bowl of mashed potatoes.
The mashed potatoes were smooth and velvety, rich with butter and cream, their golden surface speckled with vibrant green scallions. A warm, savory aroma filled the air, wrapping the room in a comforting embrace.
“Averi, come try this,” Noah said, setting the bowl on the dining table.
With an excited cheer, Averi dashed over, his wide eyes locked onto the dish as if it were the greatest treasure.
Noah scooped up a spoonful, blowing gently to cool it before holding it up to Averi’s lips. “Careful—it’s still hot. Blow on it first.”
Averi obediently puffed at the spoonful before taking a bite. The moment the creamy potatoes hit his tongue, his face lit up with pure delight. “Wow! It’s so yummy!”
Noah found himself smiling—an easy, genuine expression that rarely found its way to his face.
But before Noah could say anything, the sharp click of a key turning in the lock interrupted the moment. The door swung open.
gα ? ησ ν s?com has it all
Both Noah and Averi turned their attention toward the entrance. Standing there quietly in the doorway was Alex.
Noah’s smile vanished instantly, replaced by a shadow of irritation. He hadn’t expected Alex to show up at the door, entering with a key.
Alex was equally stunned to find Noah in Sadie’s apartment. He hesitated briefly before his expression settled into an uncomfortable calm. He had rushed over after receiving Carol’s call, concerned for Sadie and Averi.
“Alex!” Averi beamed, his excitement clear as he greeted Alex.
Noah’s brow furrowed deeper. He was puzzled why Averi referred to Alex, his biological father, so easily. Yet, Noah could feel the deep bond between them, which sparked an unexplainable irritation within him.
He set down the bowl he was holding, his voice cold as he addressed Alex. “Mr. Howe, isn’t it a bit inappropriate to show up unannounced at this hour?”
Alex’s hands tightened into fists at his sides. Clearly, Noah was sending a warning.
Taking a controlled breath, Alex managed to keep his anger at bay, responding evenly, “Mr. Wall, I was just concerned for Sadie and Averi.”noveldrama
“Concerned?” Noah’s scoff was sharp. “Mr. Howe, don’t you think your ‘concern’ is rather excessive? Sadie and Averi are under my care.”
“Your care?” Doubt clouded Alex’s eyes.
“Don’t bother yourself, Mr. Howe,” Noah continued, his tone edged with a challenge. “You seem to find reasons to show up often. Could it be that you have… ulterior motives?”
Alex looked visibly annoyed. He struggled to maintain his composure, replying sharply, “Watch your language, Noah!”
“Watch my language?” Noah mocked. “Mr. Howe, remember this is Sadie’s home, not your domain. What right do you have to tell me what to say?”

###Chapter 462:
Alex started to respond, but was interrupted by a familiar voice. “What are you two arguing about?” Sadie had just walked in.
She lingered in the doorway, her expression one of puzzlement as she absorbed the charged atmosphere of her apartment.
Upon seeing Sadie, Alex immediately tempered his demeanor, his frustration yielding to a tender concern. “You’re back, Sadie.”
He approached her, his tone warm. “Are you okay? I was worried about you.”
Sadie met his gaze briefly, her response detached. “I’m fine.”
“Sadie.” Alex paused, struggling with his words. “About earlier today… I’m sorry. My mother didn’t mean any harm.”
Sadie’s complexion blanched. She steadied herself, replying, “Alex, the issue was a misunderstanding on your mother’s part.”
“But…” Alex attempted to elaborate, but Sadie interrupted him. “That’s enough. Let’s drop it.” Her voice bore exhaustion. “I’m tired. I need to rest.”
Alex looked at her, his face etched with worry. He opened his mouth to speak, seeking to comfort her, but found himself at a loss for words.
Noah observed from a distance, his demeanor cool. He could sense the special bond between Sadie and Alex, a connection he felt excluded from. Jealousy gnawed at him, fueling wild speculation that Sadie and Alex might have discussed serious commitments, like marriage. This thought only deepened his irritation.
“Pak!” Abruptly, Noah snapped his fingers.
Instantly, men in black suits burst in, their movements swift and coordinated, as they encircled Alex.
“What are you doing, Noah?” Sadie exclaimed, panic rising as she stepped forward to intervene.
But Noah was quick to seize her wrist, drawing her close. His eyes were cold as he stared at Alex. “Take him away.”
€$? ?н€?$ 1? glov?l.?m
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” the men in black responded in unison, moving to apprehend Alex.
“Let me go! Let go of me!” Alex struggled in vain.
“Release him, Noah!” Sadie tried to break free from Noah’s firm grasp, but he held fast.
“Pak!” Noah snapped his fingers once more. This time, a new group of men surrounded Averi.
“Averi!” Sadie’s scream tore through the air as panic overwhelmed her. Driven by instinct, she lunged toward her son.
But the men were quicker. One scooped up the confused boy from the dining table.
“What are you doing? Put him down!” Sadie cried out, her voice sharp with desperation as she attempted to advance. Noah stood firm, blocking her path.
He wrapped his arms around her waist, pinning her against him.
“Have you lost your mind?” Sadie yelled, struggling violently, her nails leaving trails of blood on his arm. Yet Noah seemed impervious to the pain.
“Mommy… Mommy…” Averi’s terrified voice cut through the chaos. He squirmed in the man’s grasp, his cries adding to the heartbreak of the scene.noveldrama
Sadie stopped struggling, her face streaked with tears as she looked up at Noah. Her voice was shaking. “Noah… What… What do you want?”
Noah’s expression was dark and unreadable as he leaned close, his breath warm against her ear. His voice was low, compelling, and dangerously seductive. “Sadie, do you really… crave a man that much?”
“You…” Sadie’s voice faltered. She couldn’t find the words.
Noah’s grip tightened, pulling her closer as if trying to fuse her to him.
Noah leaned close and whispered in Sadie’s ear, “If you ever need a man… you know where to find me.”

###Chapter 463:
A wave of embarrassment washed over Sadie, making her want to disappear right then and there.
With all her strength, she shoved Noah away, shouting, “Noah Wall, have you lost your mind? You’re completely insane.”
Noah, taken aback, stumbled but quickly recovered, his lips twisting into a smirk.
Straightening his collar, which Sadie had rumpled, he retorted coolly, “You’re the best judge of whether I’m insane?”
Sadie trembled, struggling to regain her composure.
“Give me back my son!” she demanded, her voice firm despite her shaking.
Noah’s gaze was inscrutable—deep and dark. “Sadie, just return to Myrtlewood Estate and I promise, no harm will come to any of you.”
His tone was threatening, with a hint of anticipation barely detectable beneath the surface.
Sadie froze.
Myrtlewood Estate… the place that had once been her and Noah’s home, the site of so many past terrors. How could she possibly consider returning there?
But Noah had Averi.
Her mind whirled with turmoil, fear clashing with resolve.
She couldn’t risk Averi’s safety.
She had to protect him.
Yet, considering the plan already in motion, perhaps returning to Myrtlewood Estate could offer her a front-row seat to a good show.
Sadie clenched her fists, her resolve hardening.
Slowly, she raised her head.
g ? ln σ ν ?s?com, where stories thrive
“Alright…” Her voice was faint, barely audible. “I agree…” She capitulated.
Noah’s expression softened as he gazed into her weary eyes. He pulled her close, resting his chin on her head, and murmured, “That’s my good girl. I won’t hurt you. Everything will be fine.”
Sadie bit her lip to stifle her tears, her body as tense as stone.
“Welcome back, Mr. and Mrs. Wall,” Breck’s voice echoed through the grand entrance of Myrtlewood Estate. Alongside him, a line of servants bowed deeply.
It was a reception befitting esteemed guests rather than the estate’s rightful residents.
Noah escorted Sadie into the villa, his grip firm and unyielding. She remained silent, her thoughts a chaotic whirl.
“Mommy!” Averi’s voice snapped Sadie out of her reverie.
She turned to see Averi at the dining table, delighting in a piece of exquisite cake. His face was playfully smeared with cream, reminiscent of a kitten that had dipped its whiskers into milk.
Relief washed over Sadie at the sight of her son safe and content.
“Averi,” she murmured as she approached him, her voice soft as she stroked his hair.
“Mommy, you’re finally here! I’ve been waiting so long,” Averi said, his smile bright, showing off his small white teeth.
Sadie’s heart twisted with a mix of joy and sorrow.
“Averi has been very well-behaved, waiting for you two to return,” Breck added timely, bringing a formal tone to the warm moment. He turned to Noah with a deferential bow. “Mr. Wall, dinner is served. It includes all the favorite dishes of you, Mrs. Wall, and Averi. Shall we begin?”
Noah gave a subtle nod of approval. He led Sadie to the dining table and personally served her a bowl of soup. “Try some soup to warm up,” he suggested, his tone gentle, a stark contrast to his earlier demeanor.

###Chapter 464:
Sadie looked down at the creamy soup before her, feeling no hunger. She held the bowl, her fingers trembling slightly, unable to lift the spoon.
“What’s wrong? Not to your taste?” Noah inquired, an eyebrow arched.
“Not exactly,” Sadie replied, managing a weak smile. “I don’t feel like eating.”
“At least eat a little. I wouldn’t want you to go hungry,” Noah said casually, continuing his meal.
The dinner atmosphere was tense and heavy. Meanwhile, Averi ate with uninhibited joy, his giggles filling the room, oblivious to the strained silence between the adults.
After the meal, Noah excused himself, retreating to the study to attend to business. Sadie followed Breck to the master bedroom.
It was the very room she had once shared with Noah. As she glanced around, each corner, each piece of furniture, seemed to echo with memories of their past together.
The weight of those memories became too much, and she turned to leave.
“Where are you going, Mrs. Wall?” Breck blocked the doorway, his tone polite but firm.
“I just need some fresh air,” Sadie replied, her voice betraying her frustration.
“Mr. Wall has instructed that you are not to leave Myrtlewood Estate tonight,” Breck informed her, his face expressionless. “Perhaps you should consider retiring to bed.”
Sadie trembled slightly, resigned.
“Alright. I understand,” she said quietly, turning back to the room.
She walked to the bed, sat down slowly, and took out her phone.

It displayed a missed call from Carol, Averi’s nanny and one of her most trusted confidants.noveldrama
Returning the call, she was greeted by Carol’s anxious voice.
“Miss Hudson, are you alright?”
“I’m fine, Carol. How about you? Is everything alright at home?” Sadie managed to keep her voice steady.
“Everything’s settled. I just got back to your apartment, but… there’s no one here. Where are you and Averi?”
“I…” Sadie hesitated, then chose not to reveal her true situation. “Averi and I had something unexpected come up. We might not be back for a few days. Please take a few days off.”
“I see… Alright then. Just remember to call me if you need anything.” Carol sounded puzzled but didn’t press further.
“Thanks, I will. Take care of yourself, too.” Sadie ended the call, her mood sinking further.
She looked out the window. Night had deepened, the lights twinkling, yet the vibrant scene only deepened her sense of isolation.
A bitter laugh escaped her lips.
“Kyla, do you really think this will break me?” she whispered into the darkness, her eyes hardening with resolve.
The International Jewelry Design Competition loomed ahead, her one opportunity to change her fortunes. Sadie was determined not to let Kyla win.
She would turn the tables, give Kyla a taste of her own medicine, and show everyone that Sadie Hudson was not to be underestimated.
Noah stood in the center of the living room, his gaze fixed on the tightly shut door upstairs, his face a mask of conflicting emotions.
“Mr. Wall.” Breck approached Noah quietly, breaking the heavy silence. He bowed slightly and spoke in a hushed tone, cautious not to disturb the stillness. “The tonic soup you requested has been prepared. Should we send it up to Mrs. Wall now?”

###Chapter 465:
Breck paused, observing Noah’s expression intently, awaiting his decision. Having worked for Noah for many years, Breck was familiar with the complexity of his employer’s moods, which were particularly enigmatic when it came to matters involving Sadie.
Noah’s behavior could swing between attentive care and aloofness, leaving his true feelings opaque.
Noah’s response was delayed as his attention drifted to Averi, who was looking at him with wide, curious eyes. Averi was in cartoon-patterned pajamas, his chubby cheeks still bearing traces of dinner’s cream, giving him the appearance of an endearing, messy kitten.noveldrama
When Noah’s eyes met Averi’s, they softened. He walked over and crouched to be eye-level with him.
“Averi,” Noah said, his voice softer than usual as he brushed Averi’s hair gently. “Could you do me a favor?”
Averi cocked his head, his clear eyes filled with inquiry. “What kind of favor?” His voice was sweet and innocent.
A subtle smile formed on Noah’s lips. He gestured upstairs. “I need you to take something to Mommy, okay?”
“Take something to Mommy?” Averi blinked, his face showing a hint of reluctance. He glanced from Noah to the staircase, torn between his desire to play with his toys and his reluctance to disappoint Noah.
“Be a good boy, Averi. I know you’re the best boy,” Noah encouraged, his tone patient and gentle. “You take this to Mommy, and then you can sleep with her tonight. What do you think?”
At the mention of sleeping with his mom, Averi’s face lit up. He nodded enthusiastically, his voice determined. “Okay! I’ll help you, Mr. Wall.”
Noah’s smile broadened with satisfaction. He straightened up and directed Breck, “Please bring the soup here.”
?tst chptrs in glnoνels.
Breck acknowledged with a quick nod and hurried to the kitchen. Returning shortly, he carried a tray adorned with an exquisite white porcelain bowl. The tonic soup inside exuded a delicate sweet aroma.
Handing the tray to Averi, Noah cautioned, “Be careful, Averi. The soup is hot.” Averi grasped the tray firmly with both hands, his expression serious. “Don’t worry, Mr. Wall. I won’t spill it.”
Noah affectionately ruffled his hair. “Good boy.”
He watched Averi ascend the stairs with careful steps, disappearing around the corner. As Averi vanished, the smile on Noah’s face slowly dissolved into a complex expression. He turned to Breck, his voice dropping to a chill tone. “Sadie is allowed to go out. There’s no need to stop her.”
Breck, caught off guard, quickly recovered and bowed slightly. “Understood, Mr. Wall.”
The upper floor remained silent. Noah’s expression tensed slightly. He was concerned Sadie might have hurt herself. He stood, intent on going upstairs to check on her.
Just then, Averi’s cheerful voice echoed down the stairs. “Mommy, Mommy, come out! I brought you something delicious.” Noah halted, a smile reappearing. He resettled on the sofa and resumed watching TV, though his attention stayed fixed on the upstairs. He was waiting, anticipating Sadie’s appearance.
Upstairs, Sadie sat on the edge of the bed, her body tense. Then, she heard Averi’s voice outside the door. Her body trembled slightly. She quickly spun to face the door. Taking a deep breath to steady herself, she hurried to open it.
Outside, Averi awaited her, tray in hand, where the white porcelain bowl sat, the sweet aroma of the soup filling the air. When Averi saw her, his face lit up.
“Mommy, you finally came out! I’ve been waiting for a long time,” he said, his voice brimming with excitement and joy.

###Chapter 466:
Sadie’s gaze fell on Averi, her heart warming with affection.
Sadie crouched down and gently stroked Averi’s hair, her voice enveloping him like a warm hug. “What’s this, Averi?”
“It’s tonic soup, Mommy.” Averi held up the tray proudly, his eyes shining. “Mommy, try it! It’s really good.”
Sadie’s heart sank. She knew all too well who had sent the soup through Averi. And she understood precisely why Noah had done so. It was his tactic to soften her, to break her resolve.
Taking the tray from Averi’s hands, Sadie set it on the nearby table without tasting it.
“Averi, Mommy’s not hungry right now. Why don’t you go play for a bit?” Her voice was gentle, yet there was a firmness to her words.
Averi looked at the bowl briefly, his disappointment evident, but he nodded obediently. “Alright, Mommy. Just call me when you need anything.”
“Will do.” Sadie smiled and affectionately pinched Averi’s chubby cheeks.
Averi scampered out of the room with youthful energy. Sadie watched him leave, her smile slowly fading. Turning back to the table, she picked up the bowl of soup, her face expressionless. She knew this soup was Noah’s way of reaching out, a siren song of sorts.
The next morning, Sadie slowly opened her eyes. Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting dappled light across the room. She shifted, immediately feeling a deep ache in her body. Struggling to sit up, she looked around. The bedroom was opulent yet alien. Her heart sank with each ticking second.
She threw off the covers, rose from the bed, and walked to the window. Outside, a meticulously maintained garden unfolded—lush and vibrant, filled with the cheerful chirping of birds. Despite the idyllic scene, Sadie felt an intense sense of suffocation.
Feeling like a bird trapped in a gilded cage, Sadie turned and walked to the door, touching the handle. It was locked, just as she expected. Her face drained of color.
Every chapter lives on g a lno vels ; comm
With desperation rising, she pounded on the door, her voice hoarse as she shouted, “Let me out! Let me out!” There was no response. Her cries echoed down the vacant hallway, met only by silence.
Suddenly, a faint noise at the door caught her attention. Sadie’s head snapped up. The door slowly creaked open.
Breck appeared, his expression unreadable. “Good morning, Mrs. Wall.”
Sadie eyed him with suspicion. “What do you want?”
“Mr. Wall instructed me to inform you that Averi has been taken to kindergarten,” Breck said flatly.
A chill ran through Sadie as she processed this information. Unmoving, Breck continued, “Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall has also arranged for a car to take you to the studio.”
Sadie was stunned. She gazed at Breck, her expression one of disbelief, questioning if she had heard him correctly.
“What did you just say?” she questioned, her voice laced with confusion.
“Mr. Wall has arranged a car for you to go to the studio,” Breck repeated.
Sadie struggled to make sense of the situation. She had braced herself for Noah to confine her indefinitely, using Averi as leverage to break her spirit. But now he was allowing her to leave for the studio?
What was going on?
What could Noah possibly be planning? Her thoughts swirled with uncertainty and suspicion. She couldn’t decipher his thoughts or understand his true motives.
“Mrs. Wall, you may leave now,” Breck stated, his voice unchanging.
Sadie gave him a searching look, her expression a mix of confusion and caution. After a brief pause, she took a step forward and followed Breck out of the room and down the stairs.noveldrama
Outside, a black car waited in front of the villa, the driver standing by respectfully, holding the door open for her. Sadie inhaled deeply and slid into the car. As the vehicle pulled away from Myrtlewood Estate, the landscape outside blurred past her window, her mind racing yet feeling empty. 
.

.
###Chapter 467:
“Take me to Stonemont Estate,” Sadie instructed abruptly. The driver nodded after a brief pause. “Understood, Mrs. Wall.” The car veered toward Stonemont Estate.
Gradually, Sadie felt a semblance of calm returning. There was much she needed to address. She resolved not to let Noah dominate her decisions. It was time to regain control and assert her independence.
The car soon pulled up to Stonemont Estate. Sadie alighted swiftly and made her way into the villa.
Inside, Eva was arranging a bouquet of fresh flowers on the sofa, her movements leisurely and graceful. She looked up, startled, as Sadie entered. “Sadie? What brings you here?” Eva put down the flowers and stood to greet her.
Sadie’s face was a mask of conflicting emotions. “Good morning, Ms. Shaw. I…” Her words faltered. She was unsure of how to explain her situation.
Eva’s expression shifted to one of concern as she observed Sadie closely. “What’s wrong, Sadie? You look so pale. Did something happen?”noveldrama
“Ms. Shaw…” Sadie tried to steady the turmoil churning within her, aiming for a voice that was both calm and determined. “I need to ask you for a favor.”
Eva’s eyebrow arched, a flicker of intrigue crossing her refined features. She motioned for Sadie to take a seat, her tone both gentle and inquisitive. “Oh? What kind of favor would make you come to me in person?”
Taking a seat on the sofa, Sadie clasped her hands tightly together. She pulled out a tablet from her bag, turned it on, and smoothly navigated the touchscreen. A jewelry design soon illuminated the screen.
It featured a necklace, elegantly designed with a rare pear-shaped diamond at its heart, encircled by a myriad of tiny white diamonds that resembled a celestial array accentuating the pink gem’s radiance. The design married classical elegance with modern sensibility, radiating breathtaking grace.
Eva’s gaze sharpened at the sight, her years of experience in jewelry design allowing her to immediately recognize the design’s exceptional quality. “Is this…” Eva looked up at Sadie, a trace of confusion in her voice. “Your creation?”
Sadie nodded, remaining silent. She watched Eva anxiously, awaiting her judgment.

Eva scrutinized the design again, then spoke slowly. “This design is quite impressive. The creativity, composition, and attention to detail are exemplary. It’s remarkable for someone your age to produce such work.”
Hearing Eva’s praise, Sadie felt a momentary relief, but her anxiety quickly resurfaced.
Eva’s tone shifted as her expression grew incisive. “However, Sadie, you didn’t come here just to showcase your design, did you? Please, be direct. What exactly do you need my help with?”
Eva set the tablet down, folding her hands in her lap as she waited for Sadie’s explanation.
Sadie bit her bottom lip, keenly aware that she couldn’t keep any secrets from such an experienced individual.
She openly shared her current dilemma and her plan for the International Jewelry Design Competition with Eva, without embellishment or omission. “And that’s it,” Sadie concluded, releasing a deep breath as if a heavy burden had been lifted.
She looked at Eva, her eyes a mix of hope and apprehension. If Eva declined to help, Sadie doubted she could find another suitable ally.
The room fell into a profound silence.
Eva remained quiet, her expression contemplative instead of immediately revealing her position. After a significant pause, she finally spoke, her voice measured and profound.
“Sadie, do you realize the magnitude of what you’re asking?”
A chill ran through Sadie, as though she were plummeting into an icy abyss. It was clear Eva was indicating that the favor was no small task.

###Chapter 468:
“I know,” Sadie responded, her voice slightly hoarse yet her eyes resolute. “But, Ms. Shaw, I really have no other option. I need to win. I must safeguard my child and stand up for myself.”noveldrama
Her voice quavered towards the end, verging on a sob.
Eva regarded her with a complex expression, emotions flickering in her gaze. “You, my dear…” Eva sighed softly, her smile tinged with resignation. “It seems… too hard to refuse you.”
Sadie’s head shot up, a flicker of hope in her eyes. She gazed at Eva, barely daring to believe what she had heard.
“However…” Eva’s tone shifted again. “Sadie, you must understand, assisting you means I’m opposing the Wall family and Kyla directly. That poses a significant risk for me.”
“I understand, Ms. Shaw,” Sadie quickly said, her voice laced with urgency. “Ms. Shaw, I… I won’t expect you to help without something in return.”
She wanted to offer Eva money, but the gesture seemed inadequate. Given Eva’s stature, monetary rewards likely held little appeal.
“You don’t need to mention that,” Eva interjected, waving her hand dismissively. “I’m helping you not for money or any other gain. It’s simply that I admire your talent and empathize with your situation. More importantly…”
She paused, her gaze intensifying. “I refuse to watch a promising designer like you be suppressed and wasted.”
Tears sprang to Sadie’s eyes. She looked at Eva, her heart swelling with gratitude and respect.
“Thank you, Ms. Shaw,” she managed to say, her voice shaky. “Thank you for your trust and for your willingness to help.”
“Alright, no need for tears, Sadie.” Eva smiled, shaking her head as she passed a tissue from the coffee table. “Wipe your tears. You’re competing in the International Jewelry Design Competition. You need to show your strength, not your tears.”

Sadie accepted the tissue, dabbed at her eyes, and took a deep breath to steady herself.
“I won’t let you down, Ms. Shaw.”
Eva nodded, pleased. “I believe in you.”
“Then… I should go now, Ms. Shaw.” Sadie stood, giving Eva a deep bow. “After the contest, I will express my gratitude properly.”
“Go on,” Eva said with a smile. “I’ll be looking forward to your success.”
With one more word of thanks, Sadie turned and left the living room. She exited the villa and approached the black car that waited outside. Her expression tightened involuntarily at the sight of it. She hadn’t expected it to still be there.
With no other transportation options available on the mountain, she sighed in resignation, opened the car door, and slid inside.
“Where to now, Mrs. Wall?” the driver inquired respectfully.
Sadie gazed out the window, her mind adrift.
“Back to my studio, please.”
The driver started the engine. Sadie leaned back, closing her eyes slowly, trying to distance herself from the emotional weight of her recent conversation with Eva.
“Buzz… Buzz…” Her phone’s sudden vibration jarred her from her thoughts. Opening her eyes, Sadie retrieved her phone from her bag, noticing an unfamiliar number on the display. She hesitated briefly before answering. “Hello?”
“This is Vivi.” The voice was familiar yet distant, tinged with a mix of arrogance and challenge.
Sadie furrowed her brows. Vivi? Why was she calling now?
“Vivi? What do you want?” Sadie’s tone was icy, edged with caution. She and Vivi were competitors, typically staying out of each other’s way.

###Chapter 469:
“What, Sandra? Can’t I just call for a friendly chat? We were colleagues once, weren’t we?” Vivi’s laugh was overly sweet, her voice oozing insincerity.
Sadie cut to the chase. “What are you really after, Vivi?”
“Ah, Sandra, always so direct.” Vivi chuckled, her voice now smug. “I just wanted to share some good news. My studio officially opens today.”
“I see.” Sadie’s reply was flat, disinterested. Vivi’s news was irrelevant to her. She couldn’t care less.
“Sandra, you don’t seem surprised at all?” Vivi’s voice carried a note of irritation. She was unhappy with Sadie’s lack of reaction.
“Why should I be?” Sadie shot back, her sarcasm palpable. “Your studio opening—what does it have to do with me?”
“How could it not?” Vivi’s tone became sharp, deliberately provocative. “Sandra, you’re an internationally renowned designer, yet your studio remains unseen. Don’t you want… to let it shine too?”
Sadie immediately grasped the dual nature of Vivi’s words—both a boast and a challenge.
“Vivi, there’s no need to show off to me.” Sadie’s response was frostier than before. “The success of your studio is your concern. My interest, or lack thereof, is my own.”
“Sandra, don’t be like that.” Vivi’s voice softened, seemingly cajoling. “I’ve invited almost every prominent designer to my opening. Everyone is expecting you.”
“Not interested.” Sadie dismissed her flatly, her tone unwavering. “Vivi, we walk different paths. Please, don’t contact me again.”
With that, she ended the call and dropped the phone back into her bag.
“Humph!” On the other end, Vivi was left listening to the disconnect tone. Her expression darkened, and a sneer crossed her lips, a glint of malice in her eyes. “Think you can avoid the storm by ignoring me, Sadie? Just wait. The real show hasn’t even started.”

Unaware of Vivi’s scheming, Sadie felt a wave of irritation wash over her. The call had only added to the weight she already felt.
The car continued swiftly toward the city center.
Soon, Sadie reached her studio. She walked to her desk, sat down, and powered up her computer, ready to immerse herself in work. But as soon as she launched the browser, a slew of headlines captured her attention.
“Majestic Ego’s Chief Designer Vivi Quinn Launches First Domestic Studio with a Bang.”
“Vivi Quinn’s Studio Opening Ceremony Dazzles, Industry Elites Gather.”
“Vivi Quinn’s Studio Overwhelmed with Orders on Opening Day, Promising Future Ahead.”
Each headline and every stunning photo underscored the triumph and allure of Vivi’s studio.
Sadie clicked on an article, rapidly scanning its contents. The piece featured Vivi in a breathtaking gown, surrounded by flowers and applause, her expression one of undeniable confidence and joy. She addressed the reporters with poise and assurance, her words brimming with ambition.
“My studio is set to become the premier design brand in Helva, offering unparalleled design services to our clients…”
“I envision my studio as a beacon in the domestic design landscape, setting the trends in fashion…”
“I’m confident that soon, we will be recognized as one of the top design brands, both here and abroad…”noveldrama
In the article’s comment section, the conversation buzzed.
“Vivi’s studio just opened, but where’s Sandra?” 
.

###Chapter 470:
“Where’s Sandra? Has anyone seen her?”
“Is she too proud to show up?”
“Vivi is now Majestic Ego’s chief designer. How can Sandra even compete?”
“Exactly! Sandra’s designs are decent, but she’s no match for Vivi.”
“Vivi’s studio secured several major orders on its first day. Has Sandra’s studio created any buzz?”
“It seems Sandra is completely overshadowed by Vivi this time.”
“Knock. Knock. Knock…”
At that moment, a knock at the door pulled Sadie from her reverie.
“Come in, please,” she responded, her voice slightly raspy.
The door swung open and Nanette entered.
“You’re back, Sadie,” Nanette said, her tone respectful.
“Yes.” Sadie acknowledged her. “By the way, please deliver this design draft.”
Nanette examined the draft carefully and nodded. “Understood. I’ll see to it immediately.”
“Thank you.” Sadie nodded. “Go ahead.”
With the design draft in hand, Nanette exited the office.
“Nanette, you…” Kyla’s gaze remained fixed on the crisp design draft glowing on her phone screen, her eyes alight with barely contained exhilaration. She abruptly lifted her head, her voice quivering with emotion. “You really managed to get it!”
Nanette said nothing, merely offering a silent nod, her expression betraying a complex mix of emotions.
“This is incredible! You’re amazing!” Kyla exclaimed, throwing her arms around Nanette in a burst of excitement. “Now let’s see what tricks that scheming Sadie has left to challenge me.”noveldrama

A slow, devious smile curled on Kyla’s lips as she turned away. “You did well, Nanette. Rest assured, your mother will be taken care of. I’ve already spoken to the hospital and arranged for top specialists to oversee her treatment.”
Nanette stiffened for a brief moment, her smile faltering. Clenching her fists, she lowered her head slightly. “Thank you, Miss Wade.”
Wasting no time, Kyla eagerly opened WhatsApp and sent Vivi a voice message. “Vivi, I have it.”
The moment the message was sent, a victorious grin spread across Kyla’s face. She could already envision Sadie’s downfall at the competition—her reputation in tatters.
Moments later, Vivi replied with a voice message. “Kyla, you’ve done a great job. Everything’s set on my end. Come here immediately.”
“Got it. I’m on my way.” Kyla ended the call, grabbed her bag, and dashed out the door.
At Vivi’s studio, the grand opening event had just wrapped up. Guests trickled out while a few staff members lingered, tidying up the aftermath. The red carpet remained in place, and floral arrangements on either side stood fresh, their delicate scent still lingering in the air.
As Kyla arrived, she spotted Vivi at the doorway, seemingly awaiting her.
“Vivi!” Kyla hurried over, handing her phone to Vivi. “Here’s the design draft.”
Vivi tapped the screen, pulling up the image and skimming over it swiftly.
“Well, well… Kyla, you are really amazing.” Amusement flickered in Vivi’s eyes as she glanced up. “Infiltrating Sadie’s studio and snatching this from under her nose? That’s ruthless!”
“Hmph! That woman deserves nothing less.” Kyla scoffed, her gaze glinting with malice.
“But…” Vivi hesitated, her tone shifting slightly. “Kyla, I have no personal grudge against Sadie. Perhaps it’s best if you handle this draft yourself. What do you say?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 471:
“No personal grudge?” Kyla sneered, as if she had just heard something absurd. “Vivi, don’t fool me. Are you seriously going to pretend you don’t want to surpass Sadie? That you don’t dream of making your studio the most prestigious in Helva?”
Her expression hardened. “And now, you’re telling me to handle it alone? Vivi, do you take me for a fool? What’s the plan—if this backfires, you’ll wash your hands of it and pin the blame on me? Do you think I’m that easy to fool?”
Vivi was momentarily stunned by Kyla’s sudden sharpness. She hadn’t expected the usually gullible Kyla to catch on so quickly.
“Kyla, you misunderstand.” Vivi quickly regained her composure, flashing a warm, reassuring smile. “I would never do that to you. We’re a team, remember? We’re in this together.”
She stepped forward, linking arms with Kyla and leading her to a nearby sofa. “Kyla, I know you’re frustrated. Don’t worry—I’ll take care of everything,” Vivi said soothingly, gently taking the phone from Kyla’s grasp.
“Leave the draft with me. Just sit back and enjoy the show. This time, Sadie won’t recover from the disgrace she’s about to face at the competition.” Kyla’s tense expression finally relaxed. She gave a small nod. “That sounds more like it.”
“Kyla, trust me,” Vivi assured her, patting her chest confidently. “When this is over, we’ll celebrate properly.”
“Alright. It’s a deal!” Kyla grinned.
“Deal!” Vivi echoed with a smirk.
Satisfied, Kyla exited the studio.
The moment she stepped outside, Vivi’s sweet smile vanished, replaced by a cold, contemptuous look.
“Fool,” she muttered with disdain. “Does she actually think she’s worthy of negotiating with me?”
She glanced down at the draft on the screen, a shadow of confusion crossing her mind. Something about it felt… off.
Read it first on g?lno?els.c?m
Though meticulously designed, the piece lacked a certain brilliance—a distinctive spark that had always defined Sadie’s creations.
Was she overanalyzing?
Frowning, Vivi replayed memories of Sadie’s previous masterpieces. Each had been striking, bursting with originality and flair—impossible to forget. Yet the draft before her, while impressive, fell short of that level.
Could it be that Sadie’s talent had declined?
Vivi shook her head, pushing the thought aside.noveldrama
Impossible!
Then what exactly was happening?
No matter how much she strained her mind, the situation refused to make sense.
She studied the design draft for what felt like an eternity. The more she examined it, the more something felt off. Could it be… a fake?
Vivi’s heart skipped a beat. She abruptly lifted her gaze toward the doorway, but Kyla had already disappeared into the night.
Vivi’s expression darkened further. She tightened her grip on her phone, her fingers turning pale from the pressure.
If the draft was fake, did that mean Kyla had been deceived?
No, that couldn’t be right.
Kyla might lack sharpness, but she wouldn’t be oblivious enough to mistake a fake, would she? Besides, the draft came from an employee of Sadie’s studio—how could it possibly be fake?
Unless… Sadie had orchestrated this deliberately. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 472:
Realization struck Vivi like a thunderclap. A glimmer of understanding flashed in her eyes. So that was it.
Sadie must have planted the fake design to bait them.
“Clever move, Sadie. But you think you can fool me?” Vivi’s lips curled into a sneer, her eyes gleaming with malice.
Initially, she had planned to use the draft to disgrace Sadie at the upcoming competition. But now, that tactic wouldn’t work.
She would have to adopt a more ruthless tactic.
“Saylor!” Vivi suddenly called out.
“Yes, Miss Quinn? How can I assist you?” a young woman hurried inside, her posture respectful.
“Use this draft to create a prototype,” Vivi instructed, handing her phone to her assistant, Saylor Warren.
“Understood, Miss Quinn,” Saylor responded, taking the phone.
“And make sure it’s done under Kyla Wade’s name,” Vivi added coolly.
“Kyla Wade?” Saylor hesitated, puzzled. “Miss Quinn, why are we using her name?”
“Just follow instructions! No more questions,” Vivi snapped, her glare sharp with irritation.
“I understand, Miss Quinn,” Saylor murmured, lowering her head as she suppressed a shiver. She dared not question further.
“Go now,” Vivi ordered with a dismissive wave.
“Right away,” Saylor replied, quickly leaving the office with the phone in hand.
As the door closed, a wicked smile played on Vivi’s lips.

“Sadie, you really think such a petty trick will save you? How naive. This time, I’ll make sure you’re completely humiliated.”
A ruthless glint flickered in her eyes. She could hardly wait for Sadie’s downfall at the competition.
Meanwhile, Nanette rushed back to the studio, her face drained of color, still shaken.
The moment she stepped inside, she made a beeline for Sadie’s office.
“Sadie!” Nanette gasped, gripping the doorframe as if to steady herself. “Kyla and Vivi… they’ve teamed up.”
Sadie sat at her desk, staring blankly at her laptop screen, her expression distant, as though lost in thought.noveldrama
At Nanette’s words, she slowly lifted her head. But there was no surprise on her face, as if she had already expected this.
“What’s wrong, Sadie? Did… did you already know?” Nanette’s voice wavered in confusion.
She stepped closer, concern etching her features.
Sadie’s gaze shifted from the screen to Nanette’s worried expression.
A soft sigh escaped her lips, tinged with fatigue. “I forgot… How could I forget…” she murmured.
“Forget what?” Nanette asked, utterly bewildered.
Sadie’s voice was almost a whisper. “Vivi and I worked side by side for three years. She understands me too well… She would have seen through the fake draft instantly.”
Nanette’s eyes widened in shock. “Wait… Are you saying… they would figure out our plan? Then… wouldn’t we be in serious trouble?”
A bitter chuckle left Sadie’s lips. “If Kyla were the only one involved, I wouldn’t be concerned. She’s manipulative, but when it comes to design, she’s no threat to me. Vivi, though… she’s different.”
“Vivi…” Nanette echoed, dread creeping into her voice. “Then… what will she do?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 473:
Sadie’s voice remained steady, but a heaviness lingered in her words. “She won’t use the fake draft as it is. No, she’ll find another way to twist it to her advantage.”
“What is that supposed to mean?” Nanette asked urgently, her voice tense. Sadie remained silent, her gaze deep and contemplative as if she were lost in thought or anticipating something.
Nanette’s anxiety heightened with Sadie’s prolonged silence. Unable to contain herself, she burst out, “Sadie, what should we do now? We can’t just sit here and wait for disaster, can we?”
Sadie shook her head slowly. “Don’t worry, Nanette. Let’s just introduce another twist to our plan.”
“Another twist?” Nanette paused, perplexed. “How?”
A subtle smile appeared on Sadie’s face, her eyes twinkling mischievously. “Issue a statement.”
“A statement?” Nanette’s confusion grew.
“Yes, a statement,” Sadie affirmed with a nod. “Announce that our studio’s unfinished design draft has been stolen.”
“Our unfinished design draft has been stolen?” Nanette echoed, still trying to understand. “Sadie, what are you suggesting?”
“Just release it quietly,” Sadie said calmly, “and remember, timing is crucial.” Nanette looked at Sadie, confusion in her eyes, but ultimately, she decided to trust her. She nodded. “Alright, Sadie. I’ll handle it immediately.”
“Good. Go now,” Sadie directed.
Nanette turned and hurried out of the office.noveldrama
Sadie watched her leave, her smile slowly giving way to a solemn expression. As night fell, the city lights sparkled like distant stars.
Outside the studio, a sleek black car was parked discreetly. The driver stood by the car, awaiting Sadie’s departure.

Taking a deep breath and straightening her attire, Sadie exited the studio. “Good evening, Mrs. Wall,” the driver said, hastening to open the car door for her.
“Mm,” Sadie murmured quietly as she entered the car.
The car left the studio, heading toward Myrtlewood Estate.
“Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall informed me he’d be attending a work-related social event tonight and might return late,” the driver said as he drove.
At the mention of “Mr. Wall,” Sadie tensed slightly, her expression remaining neutral.
She responded evenly, “I see.”
“Mr. Wall is very attentive to your well-being, Mrs. Wall,” the driver remarked, aiming to reassure her.
Sadie was momentarily startled by his comment.
A complex emotion flashed across her eyes before disappearing just as swiftly.
Sadie remained silent, turning her gaze toward the window instead.
The night was alive with bright lights and bustling streets.
Yet, Sadie felt no desire to appreciate it.
Noah was attentive to her well-being?
The irony of those words stung her.
Bitterness swelled within her heart.
The car smoothly made its way into Myrtlewood Estate and halted at the villa’s entrance.
The driver got out and opened the door for Sadie.
“Mrs. Wall, we’ve arrived,” he announced with respect. 
.

.
###Chapter 474:
“Mm,” Sadie murmured, stepping from the car.
She paused at the entrance, her eyes scanning the familiar structure, emotions swirling within her.
Sadie crossed the threshold into the house.
A familiar warmth enveloped her, yet it did little to soften the chill in her heart.
The living room was aglow with light.
A figure on the sofa turned slowly at the sound of her steps.
It was Laura.
When Sadie saw her, her eyes filled with tears. She moved quickly toward Laura, her voice shaky. “Grandma…”
“Sadie, you’re home,” Laura’s voice was soft.
Clutching Laura’s hand, Sadie felt the comforting warmth but couldn’t stop the tears that now freely flowed.
“Grandma, why… Why are you here?” Sadie stammered, her voice still trembling.
Laura gently stroked her hand, signaling her to calm down.
“It was Mr. Wall’s decision,” Breck interjected timely. “Mr. Wall mentioned that Mrs. Stewart was well enough to leave the hospital. Staying at Myrtlewood Estate ensures she receives proper care.”
Breck’s revelation struck Sadie hard, like a blow to her heart.
Noah…
Always him!
A storm of emotions brewed within her—anger, helplessness, and grief.
She understood that Noah’s motives weren’t entirely benevolent.
Explore fantastic tales on gα?ησν?s; ?οm
It was a warning, a stark reminder that he still had control over her vulnerabilities.
Laura’s safety, Averi’s safety… These were the tools Noah wielded to keep her tethered.
Noah manipulated those around him like a puppeteer with his strings, while Sadie found herself a mere pawn in his elaborate game, powerless over her own destiny.
“Grandma, how are you? Are you still in pain?” Sadie asked, suppressing the bitterness within her.
She watched Laura intently, not wanting to overlook any detail.
“I’m fine now, Sadie. Really,” Laura assured her with a kind smile. “I love you and Averi.”
The mention of Averi renewed the pain in Sadie’s heart.
Sadie strove for calm, but her voice still betrayed a hint of emotion. “Grandma, both Averi and I are well.”
“Good. Good.”
A gentle pat from Laura on Sadie’s hand conveyed her affection and encouragement.noveldrama
Sadie nodded and managed a forced smile.
She hid her vulnerability from Laura, not wanting to add to her worries.
With resolve, Sadie composed herself, aiming to show strength.
Meanwhile, in a lavish banquet hall, the clinking of glasses and the low murmur of conversations filled the air amid the rustling of fine gowns.
Noah, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, commanded attention with his authoritative presence, attracting every eye in the room.
He held a glass of red wine, swirling it slowly, his expression unreadable.
“Mr. Wall, you truly are a rising star!”
“With you at the helm, Wall Group will surely soar to new heights.”

###Chapter 475:
“I couldn’t agree more.”
The crowd kept lavishing Noah with praise.
He responded with a polite, distant smile, his demeanor cool and detached.noveldrama
Just then, a familiar figure made her way toward him.
Vivi, in a stunning red gown that highlighted her elegant posture, approached. Her makeup was perfect, enhancing her striking beauty.
“Mr. Wall, what a coincidence to see you here,” she said, her voice softly flirtatious.
A business associate, unaware of the truth, asked, “Mr. Wall, is this your wife?” With a slight frown, Noah cast a glance at Vivi and stated flatly, “No, she is not.” His words quenched the room’s enthusiasm.
The business associate’s smile faltered, and he uttered an apology. “I’m sorry, Mr. Wall. That was presumptuous of me.” He quickly excused himself.
Vivi’s confident demeanor slipped, but she swiftly recovered, teasing, “Mr. Wall, you’re as unromantic as ever.”
Noah remained silent, his gaze fixed on her.
Under his scrutiny, Vivi appeared slightly uncomfortable. She changed the subject. “Do you know, while I was abroad, Sadie and I worked together at Majestic Ego for three years?”
Noah’s expression tightened.
“What’s that look for? Are you intrigued now?” Vivi laughed playfully, noticing his reaction.
“It’s too noisy here. Shall we go upstairs to talk?” she suggested, catching a glint of interest in Noah’s eyes.
Noah’s frown deepened. He was discomforted by being seen through. Yet, he agreed, nodding slightly.
They ascended the staircase, the room’s eyes trailing them, filled with curiosity. In the VIP lounge above, Vivi poured a glass of wine for Noah.
Your imagination thrives at puntocom
“Mr. Wall, try this. It’s specially prepared for you,” she said, offering Noah the glass with a smile.
Noah took a tentative sip. The wine was bold and spicy, with a lingering richness.
“Back at Majestic Ego, Sadie and I were inseparable,” Vivi reminisced, her voice colored with nostalgia. “We worked, shopped, and dined together—almost like sisters.”
Noah listened without interruption.
“Sadie is exceptionally talented and diligent,” Vivi continued, a hint of envy in her tone. “Her designs were always lauded, and she had this allure that just drew people to her…” Time seemed to stretch on.
“Take your time, Mr. Wall,” Vivi whispered, her voice cutting through the quiet with a flirtatious edge.
Noah seemed tipsy, his frown indicating a struggle to piece his thoughts together.
The alcohol numbed Noah’s senses, leaving his mind scattered. The only thing he could clearly recall was Vivi endlessly chattering about Sadie and Majestic Ego. Yet, deep down, just one name occupied his thoughts—Sadie.
“Mr. Wall, are you okay?” Vivi noticed the way Noah fixated on her in silence, his stare unwavering and intense, sending a chill down her spine. She hesitated before cautiously resting her hand on his arm, testing for a reaction. “Did you… have too much to drink?”
Noah remained unresponsive. His body felt heavier with each passing second, his eyelids drooping. Instinct urged him to move away, but his limbs refused to obey.
“Mr. Wall, you…” Vivi’s hand trailed up to his chest, her fingers toying with his shirt buttons, teasingly. She sensed a faint tremor run through him. A thrill sparked within her—this was her chance!
She inched closer, lips slightly parted, her warm breath brushing against his skin as she whispered, “Mr. Wall…” 
.

###Chapter 476:
Just as she was about to press a kiss to his cheek, Noah abruptly swung his arm with force. “Get lost!”
His voice was rough, laced with irritation. Vivi’s hands froze midair, her complexion paling. She hadn’t expected such a harsh rejection.
“Mr… Mr. Wall…” Her voice wavered, her confidence shaken. “Did I do something wrong?”
Noah’s brows knitted together as he struggled to open his eyes, his gaze falling on the blurred figure before him. “Who are you?”
Vivi’s body stiffened, a chill creeping up her spine. She swallowed her embarrassment and forced a smile. “Mr. Wall, you’ve had too much to drink. It’s me, Vivi…”
“Vivi?” Noah’s eyes remained clouded with confusion. “I don’t know you…” With that, he shut his eyes again and attempted to get up, his body unsteady.
Alarmed, Vivi rushed forward to steady him, worried he might collapse. “Careful, Mr. Wall…” Her tone was gentle, as though nothing had just occurred. But her hands clenched into fists, nails biting into her palms.
Suppressing the frustration rising within her, she composed herself. Then, her gaze flickered with an idea. “Mr. Wall, did you… drop something?” Her voice carried a playful undertone laced with intrigue.
Noah frowned slightly, his irritation evident, but he reluctantly opened his eyes. “What?” His voice remained low and hoarse.
His reaction made Vivi’s heart race with anticipation. “I think something fell just now…” she murmured, her tone dripping with implication.
Noah’s gaze turned hazy as he followed Vivi’s line of sight, looking down at himself. His shirt was slightly undone, exposing a glimpse of his defined collarbone.
Vivi’s stare lingered there for a moment before trailing further down. Noah’s breathing became heavier.
  ? glnov?l.m
“Mr. Wall…” Vivi’s voice turned even softer, sultry. “You really did drop something…”
As she spoke, she leaned in closer, her hand reaching for his belt. Just before her fingers could touch the buckle, Noah shoved her away with unexpected force.
“Stay away from me!” His voice was ice-cold, completely devoid of warmth.
Caught off guard, Vivi stumbled back, nearly losing her balance. Her face drained of color. She never imagined Noah would reject her so ruthlessly.
“Mr… Mr. Wall…” Her voice shook, barely above a whisper.
Noah said nothing, his piercing gaze fixed on her.
Under his sharp scrutiny, Vivi’s confidence shattered. She quickly averted her eyes, unable to meet his.
She knew then—her plan had completely failed.
Frustration churned within her, but she could do nothing.noveldrama
Noah’s devotion to Sadie ran far deeper than she had anticipated.
If she wanted his heart, she’d have to find another approach.
“Mr. Wall, you… you’re drunk. Let me take you home…” Vivi steadied herself and spoke.
Her voice was calm again, as if nothing had ever happened.
Noah remained silent, offering only a faint nod in agreement.
Seeing his response, Vivi quickly stepped forward, securing an arm around him as she led him out of the lounge.
Downstairs, the banquet hall was still brimming with energy, the atmosphere unbroken.
However, the moment Noah and Vivi appeared, every gaze turned toward them. Noah’s complexion was pallid, his movements sluggish, and the effects of the alcohol were undeniable. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 477:
Vivi, wearing an expression of deep concern, held onto him firmly. Their proximity suggested an almost intimate connection, setting tongues wagging.
“What’s going on? Is Mr. Wall drunk?”
“Looks like it, but why is Vivi the one with him?”
“Could there be something more between them?”
“Wow. That’ll be interesting…”
Speculation spread like wildfire, filling the space with hushed murmurs and eager whispers.
At the hotel entrance, Noah’s personal vehicle was already stationed, waiting. Vivi carefully assisted Noah outside, ensuring he remained steady as they approached the car.
Just before reaching the door, she suddenly hesitated.
Her gaze flickered toward the nearby reporters, and then, in a calculated move, she adjusted her dress.
Her movements were slow and deliberate, clearly orchestrated to draw attention and spark speculation.
The once-flawless evening dress now had a slightly ruffled appearance, its neckline subtly shifted, revealing a glimpse of smooth skin.
A few loose strands of hair framed her face, adding a touch of effortless allure.
“Click! Click!” Cameras fired in rapid succession, capturing the scene with fervor.
The reporters believed they had struck gold—this was the kind of material that made headlines.

Vivi had achieved exactly what she wanted—spreading the impression of a deep connection between her and Noah, specifically to ignite Sadie’s jealousy.
“Miss Quinn, thank you for escorting Mr. Wall back…” Samuel approached respectfully, though his expression betrayed his confusion.
He had no idea what had unfolded between the two, but Vivi’s composed demeanor suggested something far from ordinary.
“You are welcome, Mr. Ford,” Vivi responded smoothly. “Mr. Wall had a bit too much to drink, so I thought it only right to assist him.” Fixing Samuel with an unreadable look, she added, “Since he’s still unsteady, perhaps I should accompany him the rest of the way.”
Samuel hesitated for a moment. Supporting Noah into the vehicle, he hadn’t anticipated Vivi’s suggestion.
He struggled for an appropriate response.
Before he could decline, Vivi acted decisively. She opened the opposite car door and slid in gracefully, settling beside Noah as if she belonged there. Samuel paused, his eyes locked on Vivi, who had already positioned herself in the car with quiet resolve. For a brief second, uncertainty gripped him.
He couldn’t exactly force her out, could he?
Besides, she had a point. Noah was severely drunk, and having another person around to watch over him wasn’t the worst idea.
With a resigned sigh, Samuel slid into the driver’s seat, turned the ignition, and pulled away from the hotel.
The silence in the car was heavy, tinged with an underlying tension.
Vivi sat beside Noah, stealing occasional glances at him.
The vehicle moved smoothly through the dimly lit streets, and soon, they reached Myrtlewood Estate. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 478:
After stopping the car, Samuel stepped out and opened the rear door.
“Mr. Wall, we’re here,” he murmured.
There was no response. Noah’s eyes remained shut, his breathing steady, as though he was lost in deep slumber.
“Mr. Wall?” Samuel tried again, raising his voice slightly.
Still nothing.
Left with no alternative, Samuel placed a hand on Noah’s shoulder and gave it a light shake. “Sir, wake up. You’ve arrived.”
Noah stirred slightly, his eyelids fluttering before he finally opened his eyes. His gaze was unfocused, hazy, as though he was struggling to process his surroundings.
“Where… is this?” His voice was raspy, barely above a whisper.
“You’re home, sir. This is Myrtlewood Estate,” Samuel replied.
“Home…” Noah echoed, his voice trailing off. A flicker of recognition surfaced in his eyes, shadowed by longing and confusion.
He remembered. This was where he belonged. The place he shared with Sadie.
But where was she?
Why wasn’t she here?
“Sadie… Sadie…” His voice trembled with emotion, his desperation evident.
He attempted to get out of the car, as if determined to find Sadie.noveldrama
“Sir, please stay still. Let me assist you,” Samuel said, quickly moving to support him.
Vivi stepped out as well, watching Noah, her expression a mix of emotions.
“Mr. Wall, let me help you inside,” she offered softly.
With Samuel and Vivi flanking him, Noah was carefully led into the house.
The well-lit living room radiated warmth, yet an unspoken tension lingered in the air, as if the space itself was bracing for what was to come. Sadie sat on the sofa, waiting.
Sleep had eluded her. She couldn’t rest—not tonight.
Then, the sound of footsteps reached her ears.
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat.
She stood abruptly, her gaze fixed on the entrance.
And there they were—Samuel and Vivi guiding Noah inside.
Noah’s complexion was pallid, his steps unsteady, the unmistakable effects of alcohol weighing him down. And Vivi’s grip on him was firm, her concern evident. The way their bodies leaned into each other sent an unsettling message, a sight that invited whispers and assumptions.
Sadie’s breath caught in her throat, and her eyes widened in disbelief.
“Oh, Sadie, don’t take it the wrong way,” Vivi said, her tone a careful blend of sweetness and feigned innocence. “Noah just had a little too much to drink tonight, so I made sure he got home safely.”
She stood close to Noah, her hand lingering on his arm before easing him onto the sofa. A polite smile played on her lips, but her eyes carried an unmissable challenge, daring Sadie to react.
Sadie’s expression remained unreadable. Her gaze flicked over Vivi briefly before settling on Noah—motionless, reeking of alcohol.
She recalled what the driver had mentioned earlier. “Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall informed me he’d be attending a work-related social event tonight and might return late.”
A work-related social event? Sadie almost laughed. So this was it? Getting drunk with Vivi and letting her drag him home like a trophy? Some event.
Vivi, taking Sadie’s silence as a sign of discomfort, felt a wave of satisfaction. The lack of resistance only fed her confidence. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 479:
With deliberate ease, she took a step forward—positioning herself directly between Sadie and Noah, as if staking her claim.
“Sadie, why are you staring at me? Don’t just stand there!” Vivi’s voice carried across the room, louder now, laced with an air of authority she had no right to claim. “Noah’s drunk. Help him to his room.”
She moved as if she owned the space, exuding the effortless confidence of a hostess directing a servant. In her mind, Sadie was merely an afterthought, a figure to be dismissed.
But Sadie didn’t budge. She remained still, her expression unreadable, her gaze resting on Vivi with unsettling calm—like a lake so still it became impossible to tell how deep it ran. For the first time that night, Vivi felt something shift, a barely perceptible crack in her certainty. Still, she pressed on, forcing a sweet, knowing smile.noveldrama
“Sadie, you’re not mad at Noah, are you?” she asked, her voice coated in manufactured sympathy. “I know things might look bad, but you should trust him. He—”
“That’s enough from you.”
Sadie’s voice cut through the air like a quiet storm, stopping Vivi mid-sentence. Then, in a voice far softer but infinitely colder, Sadie spoke again. “Miss Quinn, please get out of my way.”
Their eyes met—Sadie’s gaze steady, unwavering, and tinged with something Vivi hadn’t expected: impatience, as though this entire exchange had already tested her limited tolerance.
Vivi faltered.
She had anticipated meekness, hesitation—perhaps even quiet resentment. But this? This cool, detached dismissal? It left her unmoored.
She opened her mouth, searching for a retort, but under Sadie’s gaze, the words died before they could take shape. And just like that, Sadie was done. Without sparing Vivi another glance, she stepped past her, moving toward Noah with an ease that made it clear—Vivi had never been an obstacle to begin with.

Seeing Sadie move toward Noah, Vivi hurried after her, lowering her voice to a whisper, her words dripping like poison meant for Sadie alone. “Sadie, can’t you see it? Noah doesn’t love you at all. Do you really think he got drunk for no reason? That he asked me to bring him back for no reason? Wake up, Sadie! He’s just using you to keep up appearances.”
Vivi leaned in closer, her voice trembling with barely contained excitement, her breath warm and intrusive against Sadie’s skin.
“He told me himself—he’s only with you out of obligation. The only person he truly loves is me. And soon enough, he’s going to divorce you and make it official.”
Vivi’s words slithered through the air, a cruel incantation meant to shatter.
She waited, eager for the fallout—the telltale quiver of Sadie’s lips, the sharp intake of breath, the flicker of devastation in her eyes. She wanted to see Sadie crumble, to watch her shatter piece by piece.
But nothing happened. Sadie didn’t so much as flinch.
Her expression remained eerily composed, as if Vivi’s venomous confession was nothing more than background noise, a passing breeze.
She didn’t even look at Vivi. Her gaze remained fixed on Noah, her focus unwavering.
“Miss Quinn…” Sadie’s voice was calm, steady, and, to Vivi’s growing unease, laced with the faintest trace of amusement. “I appreciate you bringing my husband home.”
Sadie’s words were light, almost cordial—yet they landed like an invisible slap, sharp and deliberate.
Vivi’s breath hitched. The color drained from her face as she stared at Sadie, stunned. This wasn’t the reaction she had expected. No anger, no heartbreak, no desperate attempt to defend her marriage. Just… indifference.
Why?
Did Sadie truly not care about Noah? Did she feel nothing at all? 
.

###Chapter 480:
No. That was impossible.
Vivi wasn’t going to buy into that act!
Sadie had to be pretending, forcing herself to stay composed. She had to be swallowing back her pain, burying the devastation that was surely eating away at her.
“Sadie, you—” Vivi spoke, her voice faltering.
But Sadie had already moved past her.
“Excuse me? Can someone come here?” The command was effortless, yet it carried the weight of someone who expected to be obeyed. “Please, show our guest to the door.”
From the back, two maids stepped forward and stopped just before Vivi, heads slightly bowed, waiting. “Miss Quinn, this way, please.”
The maids’ voices remained impeccably polite, yet distant. Vivi’s face flickered between pallor and flushed fury. She lingered for a moment, her eyes burning with venom, but Sadie remained unshaken.
Without another word, Vivi turned on her heel and stormed out. Only when the sound of her retreating footsteps had fully faded did Sadie shift her gaze back to Noah—still slumped, still oblivious to the quiet storm that had passed over him.
“Breck! Where are you?” Her voice carried through the vast living room, tinged with fatigue, quiet helplessness woven into it.
She pressed her fingers to her temples, massaging away the dull ache forming there. Silence.
Sadie’s breath hitched. She straightened, scanning the dimly lit space. “Breck? Samuel?” Nothing.
A strange, uneasy stillness settled over her. Only then did she realize that it was just her and the unconscious Noah left in the living room.
Her brows knitted together, frustration creeping into her otherwise serene expression.
Your hub for updates: g?lnσνs?c?m
With a measured inhale, she bent down, bracing herself as she tried to lift Noah’s dead weight. But even unconscious, Noah’s tall frame was impossibly heavy—like a mountain she had no hope of moving.
Sadie used every ounce of strength she had, but she barely managed to shift him.
“Noah, wake up!” she ground out between clenched teeth, her voice trembling with the effort of both physical strain and sheer exasperation.
He was going to drive her insane.
“Ugh…” A low, sluggish groan escaped Noah’s lips, his body stirring slightly, though his eyes remained stubbornly shut.
Sadie seized the moment, shaking his shoulders hard.
“Noah! Can you hear me? Open your eyes!” Her voice sharpened, laced with a desperate edge she couldn’t quite suppress.
But he didn’t wake. His brows knitted together, his expression twisting as though he were caught in some unseen agony.
Sadie stared at him, her emotions warring between anger and exasperation. A part of her wanted to walk away, leaving him there to deal with the consequences of his own reckless indulgence.
But she couldn’t. She was living in his house, after all.
Exhaling slowly, she forced herself to push the frustration aside. She needed a different approach.
Instead of attempting the impossible—lifting Noah entirely—Sadie shifted tactics. She draped one of Noah’s heavy arms over her shoulder and began the painstaking task of dragging him forward, inch by agonizing inch. It was grueling.
Within moments, beads of sweat formed on her forehead, dampening her hairline. Her arms trembled under the strain, her muscles screaming in protest. Her entire body felt like a tightly wound spring, stretched to its limits, threatening to snap. But she couldn’t stop.noveldrama

###Chapter 481:
Grinding her teeth, she pressed forward, step by excruciating step. Her breathing grew ragged, her legs unsteady beneath her, but somehow, she managed to haul him through the living room, finally reaching a guestroom on the first floor.
Relief crashed over her like a wave. She was just about to lower him onto the bed when—her foot suddenly slipped.
“Oh, shit!” A startled gasp escaped her as she tumbled backward, bracing herself for the inevitable impact.
But it never came. Instead, she felt warmth. A pair of strong arms tightened around her waist, catching her before she could fall, holding her firm.
Dazed, she lifted her gaze and found herself staring into Noah’s eyes. They were no longer closed, no longer lost to unconsciousness. Instead, they were open—hazy, yet locked onto hers with unwavering intensity.
“Wait… you’re awake?” Sadie’s voice wavered, barely more than a whisper.
Noah didn’t answer.
He simply stared, his deep, unreadable eyes brimming with emotions she couldn’t decipher. Unspoken. Heavy.
The intensity of his gaze sent a jolt through her chest, making her heart race.
Instinctively, she tried to pull away, needing space between them.
“Let me go.” Her words were soft, barely audible. A plea, a warning.
But Noah didn’t release her. If anything, his grip tightened.
Before she could protest, he leaned in, his head resting lightly against her shoulder. The warmth of his breath brushed her neck, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine.
“Don’t move.” His voice was low, hoarse—laced with a quiet tenderness so fleeting, so subtle, she almost doubted she had heard it at all.
Sadie’s entire body tensed.

Why this sudden gentleness? Why now? Not only did she not understand his motives, but she also wasn’t sure if she wanted to.
“Noah, let me go. I need to go to sleep,” Sadie said, her voice soft yet firm.
Noah didn’t release her. Instead, he tightened his embrace, burying his face deeper into her shoulder.
His breath became erratic, and his body started to tremble.
Alarmed, Sadie felt a surge of concern. “Noah, what’s wrong?” she demanded.
He didn’t reply, only held her closer.
His breathing grew heavier, his trembling worsened, and heat radiated from his body, burning Sadie’s skin like an unrelenting flame.
Sadie, perceptive as ever, quickly realized the truth.
Noah had been drugged.
The color drained from her face.
Her hands clenched into fists, nails digging into her palms, the sharp pain a faint echo of the rage and humiliation now flooding her.
Vivi!
It had to be her.
How dare she drug Noah!
Fighting to control the fury rising inside her, Sadie forced herself to stay composed.
If… if Noah and Vivi had been together…
No!
She shook her head fiercely.
If that had happened, Noah wouldn’t be like this now.
“Noah, let me go! We’re going to the hospital,” Sadie commanded, her voice turning cold. noveldrama

###Chapter 482:
She pushed against him with all her strength, desperate to break free from his grasp.noveldrama
But the drug’s effect had made Noah unnervingly strong.
His grip tightened even more, restricting her breath.
A low, guttural growl rumbled from Noah’s throat. His eyes, wild and unfocused, mirrored those of a man lost to desire, devoid of all reason.
He lowered his head, his lips grazing Sadie’s neck in a fevered, aimless search for solace.
“Noah! Come back to yourself!” Sadie’s voice rang out, sharp and urgent, as she struggled in vain to escape his grasp.
“I’m burning up… I feel so hot…” Noah murmured, his voice husky and faint. His body pressed against Sadie’s, as if trying to merge with her.
Suddenly, he pushed Sadie onto the bed.
Sadie gasped in shock, her back slamming against the mattress. The impact sent pain shooting through her, bringing tears to her eyes. Noah’s weight bore down on her, immobilizing her completely.
“What are you doing, Noah?” Sadie asked, her voice shaking with fear.
Without a word, Noah’s lips found hers, sealing them with a forceful, claiming kiss.
Shock widened Sadie’s eyes. She pushed against him with all her strength, but he was immovable.
His kiss was intense, filled with raw desperation and possessiveness.
Tears spilled from Sadie’s eyes.
“Noah, please, let go of me…” she pleaded in broken whispers, but Noah seemed deaf to her cries.
He clung to her, kissing her with wild fervor. His hands moved over her body, pulling at her clothes.
€$? ￠?€?$  glov?l?o
In moments, Sadie’s casual attire was in tatters, her flawless skin exposed.
“No, stop…” Sadie’s voice was stifled by sobs, her spirit sinking into fear and despair.
She realized the gravity of the situation…
At that critical moment, a flicker of recognition crossed Noah’s eyes.
He abruptly stopped, his breathing ragged in the silent room. As if burned, he released Sadie and staggered toward the bathroom.
Swoosh!
The sound of water filled the air, masking Sadie’s quiet, trembling sobs.
Curled up on the bed, Sadie clutched the remains of her clothing, trying to cover herself.
Tears silently streamed down her face, soaking the pillow beneath her.
The sound of running water persisted from the bathroom.
For an extended period, it didn’t stop.
Unease mounted within her.
She glanced toward the bathroom, her gaze locked on the frosted glass door that veiled her view.
Was Noah okay?
The thought struck her forcefully, compelling her to action.
Disregarding her disheveled appearance and bare feet, she hurried to the bathroom.
“Noah! Noah, are you alright?” Sadie pounded on the door, her voice laden with panic and urgency.
But the only sound was the continuous rush of water; no reply came.
A heavy dread settled in her heart. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 483:
She gripped the doorknob and turned it forcefully.
With a soft click, the door swung open.
A wave of cold air rushed out, causing Sadie to shiver, but she pushed forward without hesitation.
The scene inside halted her in her tracks.
Noah lay submerged in the bathtub, his body fully under the cold water.
The bathtub was filled to the brim, the coldness emanating sharply.
Noah’s face was deathly pale, his lips tinged with blue. His body trembled lightly, and his eyes were shut, his expression one of unconsciousness.
“Noah!” Sadie’s alarm turned to action as she dove into the freezing water to haul him out with all her might.
“Noah, wake up! Don’t do this to me!” Her voice broke, thick with tears, as she repeatedly slapped his cheek, trying to rouse him.
Noah remained unresponsive.
Panic overtook Sadie.
With every ounce of her strength, she dragged Noah from the tub.
She grabbed a towel, wrapping it around him, then staggered out of the bathroom.
“Somebody! Help!” Her cry was sharp and desperate, echoing through the quiet villa.
Moments later, Breck appeared at the door, his face contorted in shock.
“What… what has happened here?” he asked, his eyes darting between Sadie and Noah’s motionless body.
“Stop asking questions and call the doctor—now!” Sadie’s voice was ragged, her urgency unmistakable.
Breck quickly snapped out of his shock and responded, “Okay, Mrs. Wall. I’m on it right away.”
Read new content at gαlnσνe?s?comnoveldrama
He turned and sprinted away, his footsteps echoing his urgency.
Seated beside the bed, Sadie watched over the unconscious Noah, her heart pounding with anxiety.
She gripped his hand, noting its ice-cold touch.
“Hang in there, Noah. You’re going to be okay,” she whispered, shaking with emotion.
The family doctor entered briskly, dressed in a white coat and a mask, carrying a medical kit.
Breck followed, his face etched with concern, accompanied by a few servants who peeked inside the room.
A faint scent of disinfectant permeated the air, enhancing the room’s sterile chill.
Sitting by the bed, Sadie clutched Noah’s hand, her pale face and quivering lips a stark contrast to the resolve in her eyes.
“Doctor, please, he needs attention. He just…” Her voice broke, tinged with emotion, but she composed herself to explain Noah’s situation.
Without a word, the doctor set his kit down, approached the bed, and started checking Noah’s vital signs.
He lifted Noah’s eyelids to shine a flashlight into his pupils, then used a stethoscope to listen to his heart and breathing.
As time slowly ticked by, each second stretched interminably.
Sadie felt her heart rise to her throat, her hands cold and sweaty.
She watched the doctor intently, fearful of missing any detail.
Eventually, the doctor set aside the stethoscope, looked at Sadie gravely, and spoke. “Mr. Wall’s condition is serious. He appears to have suffered significant stimulation, disrupting his nervous system, which has led to this unconscious state.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 484:
“Is he in danger?” Sadie asked, her voice even more tremulous, her fear palpable.
“It’s difficult to say right now. I need to administer a sedative to stabilize him first,” the doctor answered. He took a vial and syringe from his kit, filled the syringe, and moved to Noah’s side, rolling up his sleeve to prepare for the injection.
“Hold on!” Sadie’s voice halted the doctor just as he was about to inject Noah. “Doctor, could… his condition be caused by some kind of drug?” Her words were deliberate, each one heavy with the weight of her concerns. Though she suspected as much, she sought validation from the doctor.
The doctor paused, taken aback by her direct question.
After a moment’s hesitation, he nodded. “It’s a possibility I cannot exclude, but—”
“What kind of drug could it be?” Sadie interrupted, her urgency palpable.
Caught off guard by her intensity, the doctor responded, “At this moment, I can’t identify the specific substance. We’ll need further tests to determine that.”
“Alright.”
Vivi had left Myrtlewood Estate in a cab. Her expression was dark, her mood sour.
The evening’s events had initially unfolded seamlessly. She had crafted a convincing facade of closeness with Noah, capturing the media’s attention.
Vivi was sure it wouldn’t be long before Sadie succumbed to the pressure of public scrutiny. She envisioned herself effortlessly taking Sadie’s place as Noah’s wife.
Just then, her phone rang.
She glanced at the caller ID, and her complexion blanched.
The call was from a waiter at the banquet.
With a moment’s hesitation, Vivi answered. “Hello?” Her voice betrayed a hint of unease.
“Miss… Miss Quinn…” The waiter’s voice trembled with panic. “I… I accidentally took the wrong drink…”
Lɑt?st chαpt?rs n glov?.сm
“What do you mean?” Vivi felt a sudden drop in her stomach, a wave of dread washing over her.
“I mean… the wine Mr. Wall drank… It wasn’t the one you asked for… It was… it was Miss Weisenfluh’s. The one she tampered with…” The waiter’s voice faded, barely a whisper.
“What did you just say?” Vivi’s tone spiked, a mix of shock and anger. “Repeat that!”noveldrama
“I didn’t mean to… I don’t know how it happened… I just… picked the wrong one…” The waiter’s voice trembled. He was on the brink of tears.
“You… you…” Vivi was shaking with rage, her voice strained as if she were holding back screams. “Do you realize what you’ve done?”
“I understand… Miss Quinn, please… I need your help…” the waiter begged frantically.
“Help you? How can I possibly help you now?” Vivi’s response was cold and unforgiving. “Just wait. If this comes out, you’re going to prison.” With that, Vivi ended the call abruptly.
Her face turned pale, her expression one of sheer horror. Her heart pounded wildly with fear and despair.
The situation had spiraled beyond her control.
If the Wall family uncovered the truth, she risked losing everything, and her very life could be at stake.
Vivi clutched her phone so tightly that her nails left deep indents in her palm.
Yet, she felt no pain.
Her mind was a whirlwind, scrambling for a solution. She was at a loss for what to do next.

###Chapter 485:
The next morning, golden sunlight seeped through the thick curtains, spilling across the room and casting a warm glow on Vivi’s perfectly made-up face.
With an irritated sigh, she turned over, trying to escape the unwelcome brightness. But just as she was about to slip back to sleep, the shrill sound of her phone shattered the morning stillness.
Annoyance prickling beneath her skin, she sat up abruptly and snatched the device from the nightstand.
The screen flashed with a name: Kyla.
Suppressing a wave of frustration, she pressed the answer button, though the lingering edge of exhaustion and irritation still clung to her voice. “What is it?”
“Vivi Quinn, you better start explaining! Do you have any idea what’s blowing up online right now?” The sharpness in her voice made Vivi wince.
She pulled the phone slightly away, rubbing her temple as her headache worsened. When she finally spoke, her voice carried an unmistakable edge. “Kyla, unless the world is ending, lower your voice and get to the point. What’s with the hysterics so early in the morning?”
Of course, Vivi already knew exactly what Kyla was fuming about.
The entertainment headlines were plastered with her name—hers and Noah’s. Bold, attention-grabbing titles screamed speculation, accompanied by carefully curated snapshots from the night before. The kind that left just enough room for the imagination to run wild. The images were impossible to ignore.
One shot captured Vivi with her head tilted slightly, her gaze soft, almost dreamy—as if she were looking at Noah with unspoken affection.
The calculated space between them—the subtle tension, the lingering intimacy—was enough to set the internet ablaze with speculation.
“Hysterics? I think you’re the one who’s lost it! Vivi, don’t you dare play games with me. Have you completely lost your mind? Trying to seduce Noah? Are you insane—or just asking for trouble?”
Vivi let out a cold sneer, her fingers tightening around the phone.
“Seduce?”
As if she, Vivi Quinn, needed to seduce Noah.
The mere thought was laughable. Her mood soured further as memories of last night’s infuriating waiter resurfaced, fueling her frustration.
“Kyla, get a grip.” Her voice remained cool, but a flicker of unease curled in her chest. “I’m warning you—watch your words. ‘Seduce Noah’? Don’t be ridiculous. Last night was a complete accident.”
“Accident?” Kyla’s tone turned downright mocking. “Do I look like I was born yesterday? Spare me the act!”
Her disbelief was palpable, dripping with contempt.
“Vivi, you’d better start talking!” Kyla’s voice was razor-sharp, cutting through the line with barely contained fury. “What exactly did you do to Noah?”
“What could I have possibly done?” Vivi said, her tone laced with amusement. “Kyla, instead of interrogating me, maybe you should focus on something more important—like figuring out how to actually win Noah over. Because at the end of the day, that’s all you are, isn’t it? His precious first love… cherished, but never acknowledged.”noveldrama
“What did you—!” Kyla’s breath hitched, her words catching in her throat. She hated this. Hated the way Vivi so easily exposed her biggest insecurity—the painful truth she tried so desperately to ignore.
Yes, she was Noah’s first love. The one he had held in his heart for years.
But that meant nothing when she was forced to remain in the shadows, watching as Sadie—that undeserving woman—stood in the place that should have been hers.
“Don’t get ahead of yourself, Vivi,” Kyla shouted, her voice low and seething. “Let me make one thing clear. Noah is mine. No one—not you, not Sadie—can take him from me.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 486:
Vivi’s expression softened just a touch. “Kyla, let me say this again—last night was an accident.” Her voice carried an almost gentle persuasion. “I didn’t seduce Noah, nor do I have any intention of replacing you. I was just trying to help you. That’s all.”
Kyla scoffed, unconvinced. “Help me? You expect me to believe that?”
“Of course!” Vivi chuckled, the sound light, almost playful. “Kyla, we’re partners, aren’t we?” Her voice took on a silky smoothness, dripping with persuasion. “Naturally, I want to help you. After all, we both want the same thing, don’t we?”
Kyla said nothing, but she didn’t have to.
Because she knew Vivi was right.
Their goal was the same.
Sadie was the obstacle standing in their way. And once she was out of the picture, Kyla could finally take her rightful place as Mrs. Wall.
“No need to worry, Kyla,” Vivi’s tone turned almost soothing, like a lullaby whispered to a restless child. “I keep my promises. I’ll help you win Noah’s heart and make sure you become the real Mrs. Wall.”
“You mean it?” A flicker of something dangerous flashed in Kyla’s eyes. Hope.
Vivi chuckled. “Of course.”
Then, after a calculated pause, she added, “But you have to trust me. Stop acting impulsively and let me handle things. If you stir up trouble, Kyla, even I won’t be able to help you.”
Kyla hesitated for only a moment before exhaling sharply. “I get it. Fine. From now on, I’ll listen to you—I won’t mess things up.”
“Good. That’s better.” A satisfied smile curled Vivi’s lips. “Alright, take a deep breath and wait for my call.”
With that, Vivi ended the conversation. She tossed her phone onto the bed, exhaling slowly, as if releasing the weight of the interaction. She had managed to pacify Kyla for now, but unease still coiled deep within her chest, refusing to fade.
galnσνels.c○m hosts fresh updates
Meanwhile, at the Myrtlewood Estate, Noah’s eyes fluttered open. The morning light filtered through the gaps in the curtains, casting fractured beams across the room. He winced, shutting his eyes briefly before squinting against the brightness. Instinctively, he reached out to the side. Cold sheets. Sadie wasn’t there.noveldrama
Pushing himself upright, he scanned the room, his sharp eyes sweeping across the empty space. He was alone.
Then, like a tide breaking against the shore, the memories of last night came rushing back. Disjointed. Blurred. Yet oddly vivid. He remembered the drinking. The wine. Something had been off about it. Then, Sadie. The way she had looked at him—concern etched in her delicate features.
The light touch of her fingers against his skin. The way his body had grown heavier, his senses slipping away into darkness. And then—the bathtub. The last thing he remembered before the world went black.
Noah’s brows furrowed tightly. He was not just drunk the night before. Knowing his alcohol tolerance better than anyone, Noah was certain he wouldn’t have passed out from a single drink, much less ended up unconscious in a bathtub. The only plausible explanation was that someone had tampered with his drink.
But who?
Vivi?
The image of Vivi’s delicate face, masking her deceit, flashed through his mind. The previous evening’s banquet, her contrived actions, and that insinuating farewell—it all seemed too orchestrated. He remembered Sadie, and how she seemed to be close with Vivi. A complex mix of emotions clouded Noah’s gaze. If Vivi was indeed responsible, what was her aim? Was it merely to create a scandal and hurt Sadie?
“Someone, come here!” Noah’s voice was low and commanding, resonating with authority. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 487:
“Good morning, Mr. Wall. What do you need?” Breck entered swiftly, standing attentively by the bed.
Noah, buttoning his shirt, asked icily, “Who brought me home last night?”
“It was… Miss Quinn,” Breck hesitated before responding honestly.
Noah paused, his expression growing colder. “Did she say anything?”
“Miss Quinn mentioned you had consumed too much alcohol and instructed me to take good care of you,” Breck replied, eyes downcast, avoiding Noah’s gaze.
“Consumed too much alcohol?” Noah scoffed, his voice laden with sarcasm. “Send a warning to the Quinn family. Let them know not to underestimate us.”
“Yes, Mr. Wall.” Breck nodded and promptly exited.
Noah finished dressing and approached the window. The sunlight was bright outside, yet his eyes were shadowed with dark thoughts.
A few days later.
Sadie sat at her desk, staring blankly at the design draft on her computer screen, unable to concentrate. She had been keeping her distance from Noah, whether intentionally or subconsciously. Facing him felt daunting. The events of that night haunted her, a constant, painful reminder.
Meanwhile, in the Wall Group’s CEO office.
“Come in, please,” Noah’s voice was weary as he looked up.
Samuel entered, holding a file.
“Mr. Wall, I’ve brought the information you requested,” Samuel said, handing over the file.
Noah accepted it, flipping through the pages, his brow furrowing as he read. “It’s the project between Wall Group and Howe Group. Is there an issue?” Noah asked, his voice calm, revealing no emotion.
“Yes, Mr. Wall,” Samuel nodded. “A batch of goods from the Howe Group was found substandard and has been detained by customs.”
I€$? ￠tя? ?η ga?n?νεl?.c
“Really?” Noah raised an eyebrow. “What does the Howe Group have to say about such a significant issue?”
“They claim someone set them up,” Samuel replied, his voice hesitant.
“How could anyone set them up like this?” Noah scoffed coldly. He placed the file down and looked up at Samuel. “You’re quite familiar with the Howe family, aren’t you?”
Samuel tensed slightly, quickly explaining, “Mr. Wall, since the Howe family is our partner, perhaps it’s wiser to resolve this quietly rather than escalate to court.”
“Resolve it quietly?” Noah’s tone became even colder. “Samuel, have you forgotten the rules of Wall Group?”
“Mr. Wall, I…” Samuel began, but Noah interrupted him. His voice was firm, leaving no room for debate. “This issue will be handed over to the legal department. Follow the standard procedures.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” Samuel lowered his head, not daring to add more.
Sadie didn’t return home until after eight in the evening.
She walked into the living room, finding it deserted.
“Where’s Averi?” she asked Breck.
“Averi… Mr. Wall took him out,” Breck replied, his voice quivering.noveldrama
“Took him out?” Sadie’s heart sank. “Did he say when he’d bring Averi back?”
“No, he didn’t,” Breck replied, shaking his head.
Blood drained from Sadie’s face. She reached for her phone to call Noah, but there was no response.
Suddenly, the doorbell rang, cutting through her mounting anxiety. She leaped from the sofa and rushed to the door. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 488:
“Mommy!” Averi’s cheerful voice filled the air as he launched himself into Sadie’s arms with boundless energy.
“Averi…” Sadie embraced her son tightly, tears welling up as she breathed in his familiar scent.
Noah stood in the doorway, observing the tender scene silently. His expression was deep and inscrutable. Behind him, Samuel stood respectfully, holding several shopping bags.
“Aren’t all these Averi’s belongings?” Sadie inquired, noting the bags in Samuel’s hands printed with familiar cartoon patterns, clearly the ones she had prepared for Averi and sent to the kindergarten as his daily supplies.
Noah gave a slight nod, his voice deep and steady, carrying that effortless magnetism that always made people listen. “Yes. I took care of Averi’s school transfer today.”
“What school transfer?” Sadie lifted her head, her gaze snapping to his, eyes clouded with confusion. “To where?”
“A nearby international kindergarten,” Noah replied, his tone calm and matter-of-fact. “The security there is top-notch. It’s the safest place for Averi.”
Sadie fell silent. She couldn’t argue with that.
That particular kindergarten was the most prestigious in the city—renowned not just for its elite curriculum but also for its impenetrable security. It was nearly impossible to get in, and yet… Noah had made it happen for Averi.
But at the same time, why did he do this without even consulting her? Sadie swallowed the knot of irritation rising in her throat, her fingers curling slightly.
She was thankful for everything Noah had done for Averi. Truly, she was. But at the same time, why did he make such decisions without even consulting her?
“I see.” She kept her voice neutral.
g?lnσνs?c?m is packed with great reads
Sadie forced herself to stay composed. She didn’t want to let any frustration slip—not in front of Averi.
“Mommy! The new kindergarten is amazing! They have a huge slide, a few swings, and so many kids to play with!” Averi’s voice was bright with excitement as he lifted his head from her embrace.
His eyes shone as he recounted every little detail, his joy spilling over with every word. Clearly, he loved it there.
Sadie felt some of her irritation fade.
At least he was happy. And in the end, that was what truly mattered.
Just as she was about to say something, Averi suddenly stopped, tilting his little face up with a serious expression. “Mommy, you should say ‘thank you’ to Mr. Wall.”
Sadie’s lips twitched.
Ugh! Averi…
She let out a soft sigh and glanced at Noah, only to find him watching her with that familiar, faintly amused smile. His gaze seemed to ask, “Did you hear what your kid said?”
Sadie exhaled, running a gentle hand over Averi’s head. “You’re right.” Then, she softened her voice. “Why don’t you go upstairs and play for a bit? Mommy needs to talk to Mr. Wall, okay?”
“Okay!” Averi chirped, nodding enthusiastically before dashing up the stairs, his tiny legs carrying him as fast as they could.
Samuel, who had been standing nearby, took the moment to set the items he was holding at the base of the stairs. Then, turning to Noah with a respectful nod, he spoke. “Mr. Wall, I’ll take my leave now. Please excuse me, Mrs. Wall.”
Noah returned the nod. “Alright.”noveldrama
With that, Samuel left, closing the door softly behind him. And just like that, Sadie and Noah were alone. The atmosphere shifted instantly.

###Chapter 489:
Sadie, feeling a sudden unease, instinctively took a step back, trying to create some distance. But Noah moved forward, closing the gap in an instant. The faint scent of his cologne—warm, deep, unmistakably his—drifted toward her, wrapping around her senses. Her pulse quickened.
Sadie steadied herself, meeting Noah’s gaze head-on, though a flicker of wariness lingered in her eyes. “Is there something else you want to talk about?”noveldrama
Noah studied her for a moment, then let a slow, knowing smile tug at the corners of his lips. “Well, I’m sure you haven’t forgotten what Averi said.”
Sadie felt warmth creep up her neck. Of course. She should have known Noah wouldn’t let this go so easily.
“And how exactly would you like me to thank you, Mr. Wall?” Taking a measured breath, she lifted her chin slightly, forcing herself to hold her ground.
Noah’s gaze flickered—just for a moment—before a trace of admiration passed through his eyes.
“Shouldn’t you be the one deciding that?” His voice was low, husky, edged with playful teasing.
Then, he stepped closer. The space between them disappeared in an instant, and suddenly, Sadie was hyper-aware of the warmth radiating from his body, the quiet intensity in his gaze, the way the air between them seemed to shift. Her heart pounded even faster.
The logical part of her brain told her to move, to step back. But she didn’t. Instead, she forced herself to remain still, to appear unfazed—even as her breath grew unsteady.
“What happened that night… I’m willing to move past it. Let’s just pretend it never happened.”
She turned her head away, refusing to meet Noah’s gaze, as if this would make the conversation easier. Noah’s expression darkened. He knew exactly what she was referring to.
“Move past it?” His voice, once teasing and controlled, turned cold. “Sadie, do you really think you can just erase something like that from your heart?”
Every story starts at g?lnσν?s﹒оm
Sadie’s breath caught in her throat. Why was he reacting like this? Shouldn’t he be relieved that she was willing to let it go? To not dwell on the past?
Then—an unexpected voice drew their attention away from their conversation.
“Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall… dinner is ready!”
At the door of the dining room, a maid spoke, her posture stiff, clearly uncertain whether she had chosen the worst possible time to speak. Perhaps she had, indeed, interrupted something she shouldn’t have.
Sadie grasped the moment as though her life depended on it, quickly responding, “Alright. We’ll be there right away.” She pushed Noah away forcefully and rushed out of the living room, unable to endure another second. Noah watched her depart; the smile on his lips slowly vanished. His expression turned dark and unreadable.
At the dining table, a heavy silence hung between Sadie and Noah. Averi had finished his meal and retreated upstairs, leaving them alone. Sadie ate in silence, her gaze fixed on her plate, lacking the courage to meet Noah’s eyes. Her heart raced uncontrollably, and she struggled to find calm. Noah remained silent as well. He simply stared at Sadie, his piercing gaze unsettling her.
“I’m done eating, Mr. Wall,” Sadie announced, placing her fork down and standing to leave. She was eager to escape Noah’s presence.
“Hold on, Sadie,” Noah called out, halting her. She paused, turning slowly to face him, her expression one of confusion and apprehension. She wondered what he could possibly want now.
Noah retrieved a white envelope from his suit jacket and presented it to her.
“What’s this?” Sadie asked, eyeing the envelope with suspicion. The plain, unmarked envelope offered no hints of its contents. Noah remained silent, merely holding the envelope closer to her. His inscrutable gaze revealed nothing.

###Chapter 490:
After a brief pause, Sadie took the envelope. She opened it and examined the contents—a beautifully crafted card. Shock crossed her face.
It was an admission notice for the international kindergarten Averi would attend. The card, elegantly inscribed with the school’s name, included detailed enrollment instructions.
As Sadie read through the document, her expression darkened with each word. Her eyes stopped on a line that made her heart sink: “Both parents are required to attend the new student orientation at 10 a.m. tomorrow.” Sadie looked up sharply, her gaze meeting Noah’s.
“The school requires it!” he stated indifferently. “You can let Alex know.” With those words, Noah turned and ascended the stairs, his demeanor detached.
Sadie remained still, the notice in hand, her mind reeling. Averi’s parentage… Alex… Noah… What was her next step?
She began to retreat to her room but stopped suddenly at the base of the stairs. Someone was there. It was her grandmother, Laura.noveldrama
Laura held a jacket, pausing as if she had been about to descend. Worry and understanding marked her features.
Sadie’s spirits fell. It was clear Laura had caught the tail end of her conversation with Noah. Laura’s affection for her and Averi had always been profound. She must be concerned…
Tears welled up in Sadie’s eyes. She approached Laura and whispered, “Grandma, shouldn’t you be asleep?”
“Sadie…” Laura’s sigh was laden with worry and tenderness. “You and… Mr. Wall, it’s…” Laura hesitated, struggling for words.
The dynamics between Sadie and Noah were intricate. Laura recognized Sadie’s resilience. She had always borne her burdens alone, sparing her family any worry.
“I’m fine, Grandma,” Sadie reassured her with a forced smile. “Don’t fret. Noah and I will manage.”
Magic begins at g α? ησ ν s?com
“Sadie, you’ve endured so much,” Laura said, drawing her into a gentle hug. The calming aroma of essential oils and the gentle strains of soft music filled a luxurious spa, creating a serene atmosphere.
Kyla reclined comfortably on a massage bed, her eyes closed, savoring the expert touch of the beautician. She had invited Vivi for a spa day, needing to ease the tension that had developed since the banquet incident and the scandal over the photographs. Vivi appeared to be on the verge of broaching a topic when a phone interrupted them.
Kyla checked the caller ID—it was her friend from the legal department at Wall Group. Kyla answered the phone, and her friend’s worried voice filled her ear. “Kyla, something’s happened. Mr. Wall has initiated action against the Howe Group.”
“What? Really?” Kyla jumped up from the massage bed, her complexion draining of color. She was shocked. Noah had indeed moved against the Howe family. The Howes had been long-standing allies of the Wall family, with Alex previously as close to Noah as a brother.
“What exactly is happening?” Kyla asked, her voice filled with urgency.
“I don’t have all the details yet, but Mr. Wall’s approach is particularly aggressive this time,” her friend explained.
“Why would Noah take such a step?” Kyla inquired further.
“It appears to stem from some business disagreement in their partnership.” Vivi, having caught parts of the conversation, also looked concerned. She vividly remembered the confrontation between Alex’s mother and Sadie. What on earth was going on?
The atmosphere grew heavy with tension, each woman absorbed in her thoughts.
Kyla quickly got dressed and offered Vivi an apologetic glance. “Vivi, I just remembered there’s something urgent I need to handle. Please, enjoy the rest of your day here,” she said, rushing off. 
.

###Chapter 491:
Vivi watched Kyla leave, a wave of disquiet washing over her. After a brief pause, she decided to follow suit and left as well.
As Kyla stepped out of the spa, she ended the call with a sharp tap, her fingers trembling ever so slightly. Her heart pounded in her ears, but she forced herself to steady the whirlwind of emotions threatening to consume her.
“Noah actually went after the Howe family…” she murmured, the words barely above a whisper. A flicker of exhilaration danced in her eyes, though she kept her expression carefully neutral.
If—no, when—Sadie found out, how would she react? The image of Sadie crumbling under the weight of devastation, everything crashing down around her, sent a surge of satisfaction through Kyla. She could almost taste the moment, savor the despair that would undoubtedly grip Sadie’s heart.
But she wouldn’t be reckless. No, flaunting this openly would be a mistake. A sudden thought struck her, and without hesitation, she snatched up her phone and dialed.
“Nanette,” she said smoothly as the line connected, “where are you? Meet me at our usual spot. Now.”
She didn’t wait for a reply before ending the call. Sliding into her car, she pressed her foot to the gas, a slow smirk tugging at the corners of her lips as she sped off.
Vivi’s expression was a thundercloud, dark and brooding.noveldrama
“Sadie…” She spat the name like venom, her jaw clenched so tightly it ached. Her eyes burned with raw jealousy.
Why? Why did Sadie get to have both Noah and Alex wrapped around her finger? What did she have that Vivi didn’t?
In terms of family background, talent, and looks, Vivi knew she was every bit Sadie’s equal, if not superior. And yet, Noah saw only Sadie. Even Alex treated her as though she were something special.
The memory of Susannah’s confrontation with Sadie that day replayed in Vivi’s mind, reigniting her frustration all over again.
Step into a new world at gα?ησνs?c?m
NO. She refused to accept this. She would not stand by and watch Sadie revel in her undeserved glory.
A thousand schemes raced through her mind, twisting and shifting like a storm—until her gaze settled on the glowing screen of her phone. Without hesitation, she dialed. The moment the call connected, her voice was crisp, cutting through the silence like a blade.
“Saylor, it’s me.”
“Vivi? What can I do for you?” Saylor’s response was polite, so Vivi didn’t waste time.
“Did our studio take on a project from the Ellis family yesterday?” Vivi cut straight to the point.
“The Ellis family?” Saylor hesitated for a beat, then something clicked. “Ah, I see. You’re talking about Lamont Ellis’s wedding—the son of Philip Ellis, right? Yes, they placed an order for a full jewelry set with our studio.”
“That’s the one!” Vivi confirmed, her tone chilling by the second. “Move that project up. I want to meet the Ellis family tomorrow—I’ll be discussing the details with them personally.”
“Tomorrow?” Saylor sounded caught off guard. “But, Vivi, that project was scheduled for next month. Isn’t this a bit rushed? Won’t it be—”
“Enough!” Vivi snapped, slicing through Saylor’s concerns with cold impatience. “Just do as I say. Stop wasting my time.”
A brief silence followed before Saylor’s reluctant response. He didn’t dare challenge Vivi any further. “Okay. Consider it done.”
Vivi ended the call with a slow, satisfied smirk curling at the edges of her lips.
“Sadie… you love the spotlight, don’t you?” she murmured, her fingers lightly tracing the phone screen. “Then I’ll make sure you get all the attention you could ever want.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 492:
She could already picture it—the mortification on Sadie’s face, the way she would crumble under the weight of the Ellis family’s scrutiny. It would be justice. Retribution for the way Noah had disgraced the Quinn family, all for Sadie’s sake. His actions had been brutal, leaving the Quinns in a precarious position within the industry.
Vivi had never forgotten. And she never forgave.
The next morning, soft golden sunlight filtered through sheer curtains, casting a warm, gentle glow over Averi’s room.
Sadie carefully pushed open the bedroom door, her lips curving into a tender smile as she took in the sight before her—Averi, rolling across the bed in a fit of laughter, clutching a small dinosaur.
“Mommy!”
The moment Averi spotted Sadie, his face lit up like the morning sun. With an excited squeal, he scrambled off the bed, his little legs wobbling as he dashed straight into her arms.
Sadie caught him effortlessly, lifting him up and pressing a soft kiss to his chubby cheek.
“Sweetheart, today’s your first day at your new kindergarten. Are you excited?” she asked, her voice warm with affection.
“Yes, I am!” Averi cheered, waving his tiny hands with boundless enthusiasm. “I’m going to make lots of new friends!”
“That’s my boy!” Sadie laughed, tapping his nose playfully. “Alright then, let’s get you ready.”
After dressing for the day, Sadie and Averi stepped outside, their hands clasped together.
The morning sunlight bathed them in a golden glow. Sadie’s tailored business suit, simple yet elegant, accentuated her graceful figure. Loose waves of chestnut hair cascaded over her shoulders, adding to her poised and professional aura.
Your source: glnvls.
Beside her, Averi was the picture of charm, dressed in a crisp blue shirt and suspenders. With his bright eyes and endearing smile, he looked every bit like a tiny prince, effortlessly drawing smiles from the passersby.
But as mother and son walked on, unaware, a pair of eyes observed them from a second-floor window.
The gaze was deep, unreadable—its emotions locked away in an impenetrable silence.
Soon, Sadie and Averi arrived at the prestigious international kindergarten, its high-security measures ensuring a safe and exclusive environment. At the registration desk, a young teacher greeted them with a warm smile.
“Good morning! Are you Averi’s mother?”
“Yes, I am,” Sadie replied, her tone polite yet composed.
“Wonderful. Please fill out this form.”
The teacher handed Sadie a document requesting essential details—Averi’s name, age, home address.
Sadie took the form with a nod and began filling it out carefully. Her pen glided smoothly over the paper—until she reached the section labeled “Father.”
A quiet hesitation settled over her, invisible to everyone but herself. Then, with a measured breath, she wrote “Deceased” in the empty space.
“Miss, I’d like to request that any details regarding my son’s father remain confidential,” she said to the teacher, her voice calm but firm.
“My… My son’s father has passed away.” Sadie lowered her gaze, concealing the sorrow and frustration in her eyes. She didn’t want Averi to be ostracized or ridiculed for growing up without a father. Also, she didn’t want to drag Alex into this matter again. Cutting ties with him was the best way to avoid unnecessary complications.
“Oh… I see…” The female teacher hesitated, clearly taken aback by the revelation. Her expression softened with sympathy as she looked at Sadie. noveldrama

###Chapter 493:
“I understand, ma’am. I’ll keep this confidential,” the teacher quickly assured Sadie.
“I appreciate it,” Sadie replied with a grateful smile before crouching down to gently stroke Averi’s hair. “Averi, be good and listen to your teachers, okay?”
“Okay, Mommy! Don’t worry, I’ll behave!” Averi nodded eagerly.
“That’s my boy.” Sadie kissed his forehead tenderly. “I’ll come pick you up after work.”
“Alright!” Averi replied obediently.
With reluctance, Sadie walked out of the kindergarten. Standing at the entrance, she watched as Averi’s small figure disappeared into the classroom, and a mix of warmth and melancholy filled her chest. He was growing up—sooner or later, he would become independent and no longer need her as much.
Letting out a quiet sigh, she finally turned to leave.
Just then, a black Rolls-Royce Phantom glided to a halt in front of her. Her heart clenched…
Noah.
Why was he here?
She instinctively stopped in her tracks, frozen in place.
The tinted window rolled down slowly, revealing Noah’s strikingly handsome features. He sat inside, tilting his head slightly as he studied her with an unreadable expression. His dark eyes betrayed nothing, making it impossible to gauge his thoughts.
“What are you doing here?” Sadie asked warily.
“Get in.” Noah didn’t bother answering her question—he simply issued the command in a calm, authoritative tone. His voice was low and magnetic, carrying an air of control that was impossible to ignore.
g?lnσνs?cóm is your escape
Sadie hesitated but eventually obeyed.
Inside the car, the familiar scent of Noah’s cologne lingered in the air, a fragrance she had long associated with him.
The silence was abruptly broken by Noah’s unexpected question. “Where’s Alex?” Hearing this, Sadie tensed immediately. She hadn’t expected Noah to bring up Alex out of the blue. Just moments ago, she had told the kindergarten teacher that Averi’s father was no longer alive. Now, Noah was asking about Alex. What was she supposed to say?
Her thoughts scrambled for an answer. She lowered her gaze, hoping to mask the panic flickering in her eyes.
Lies only led to more lies. She hated deception, but more than anything, she couldn’t allow Averi to become part of the Wall family. That cold, unfeeling household would only bring him pain. She had to protect him.
“He… he had something urgent to take care of and will come later,” she stammered, her voice barely steady. She tried her best to control her emotions, not wanting Noah to see through her.
“Is that so?” Noah’s sharp gaze flickered with something unreadable. His long fingers tapped rhythmically against the armrest. The soft but deliberate sound filled the quiet car, heightening her unease.
He didn’t say anything further, simply watching her in silence.
Just a while ago, Lara Waddy—one of the teachers from the prestigious international kindergarten—had contacted him. After all, the school was funded by the Wall Group.
“Are you hiding something from me, Sadie?” Noah asked directly, causing Sadie’s heart to plummet.
Sadie parted her lips but found herself unable to speak.
What could she possibly say? That Averi was hers alone and had nothing to do with him? That she had fabricated a lie about his father being gone just to keep him away from the Wall family?

###Chapter 494:
Either explanation would only enrage Noah further.
“I’ll take you to the studio,” Noah said coldly, dropping the topic without pressing further. He then instructed the driver to start the car.
The vehicle eased forward, gliding toward its destination.
Sadie stared out of the window, watching the scenery blur past. Her mind was in turmoil, yet Noah acted as though nothing had happened.
He simply leaned back, shutting his eyes to rest.
Meanwhile, Sadie sat stiffly, feeling like a guilty child caught in a lie.
When the Rolls-Royce finally rolled to a stop at the studio entrance, Sadie unfastened her seatbelt and stepped out.
Noah didn’t speak. Instead, he pulled out his phone and made a call.
“Samuel, it’s me. I need you to take care of something immediately. Get a DNA sample from Averi and Alex. I want you to run a paternity test. And make sure no one finds out.”
“Do it as soon as possible,” Noah commanded, his voice low and detached, carrying an unmistakable chill that brooked no argument.
“Understood, Mr. Wall. I’ll take care of it immediately,” Samuel responded with respect, his voice coming through the phone.
After he ended the call, his expression betrayed a moment of confusion. He struggled to understand why Noah had suddenly instructed him to arrange a paternity test for Averi and Alex. Shaking his head, Samuel decided not to dwell on the reasons. His priority was to execute the task given to him. He grabbed his coat, preparing to leave.
Just as he was about to exit, his phone vibrated with an incoming call.
The screen showed an unlisted number.

Samuel paused, then answered cautiously. “Hello. Who is this, please?”noveldrama
“Mr. Ford, it’s me, Barnes Mabb, the specialist in reconstructing torn documents.” The voice on the other end was both unfamiliar and unexpectedly enthusiastic.
“Specialist in reconstructing torn documents?” Samuel, momentarily caught off guard, asked. “What’s up?”
“Don’t you remember the torn-up paper you sent me last time, Mr. Ford?” Barnes reminded him quickly. “I hope you haven’t forgotten!”
Samuel then remembered the incident. Previously, he had found a shredded document belonging to Kyla that seemed suspicious, and he had sent it to an expert for reconstruction.
“Ah, right. I remember now,” Samuel said. “How is that going?”
“To be honest, I haven’t made much headway,” Barnes confessed apologetically. “The paper was torn into very small pieces, and some parts are missing. It’s quite a challenge. I’ll need more time to complete it.”
“How much longer do you need?” Samuel inquired.
“It’s hard to say, Mr. Ford,” Barnes answered with hesitation. “I need at least another week.”
“Another week?” Samuel’s frown deepened.
“That’s the best I can do, Mr. Ford,” Barnes explained helplessly. “I’m already pushing the limits of my capabilities.”
“Fine.” Samuel sighed. “Just do your best.”
“OK, Mr. Ford. I’ll do my best,” Barnes assured him.
After ending the call, Samuel shook his head in frustration. He decided to set the matter aside for now and concentrate on the task Noah had assigned him.
Sadie had just entered her studio and was yet to set down her bag when Nanette rushed in, breathless and frantic. 
.

###Chapter 495:
“Sadie! I’m so glad you’re here!”
Nanette leaned against the doorframe, panting heavily. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead, a testament to her rush.
Seeing her in such anxiety, Sadie quickly moved to support her, her expression marked with concern.
“What’s the matter, Nanette? What’s happened? Why are you in such a hurry? Look at you, you’re soaked in sweat.”
Nanette took several deep breaths before she could articulate her words. “Last night… Kyla… she asked to see me…”
“Kyla?” Sadie’s expression sharpened. “What did she want?” Her voice chilled, tinged with suspicion.
Nanette managed to steady her breath and whispered, “She was asking about something…”
“What was it?” Sadie urged, her attention fixed.noveldrama
Nanette swallowed hard, her voice barely audible. “She mentioned something went wrong with the major joint project between Howe Group and Wall Group… and Mr. Wall… was blaming Howe Group…”
“What? Is that true?” Sadie’s face fell, her eyes widening with concern. Though she wasn’t directly involved in the project, she was aware of its significance. It was a massive undertaking, crucial to both families. Alex was always meticulous. How could something have gone wrong?
And Noah wasn’t one to hastily oppose the Howe family. There must be deeper secrets involved.
A torrent of thoughts and concerns overwhelmed Sadie, leaving her feeling unsettled. She took a deep breath, pulled out her phone, and dialed Alex.
“Beep… beep… beep…”
Every story starts at gα?ησν?s?com
The phone rang on and on, but no one answered. With each unanswered ring, Sadie’s heart sank a little more. A dark premonition enveloped her, squeezing her chest with anxiety.
If Alex wasn’t picking up, it likely meant trouble.
Sadie grabbed her bag and said, “Nanette, keep an eye on the studio for me. I need to go to Howe Group immediately.”
“You’re heading to Howe Group?” Nanette’s voice was laced with concern. “But… Is that wise at this moment? What if you…”
Nanette’s voice trailed off, her hesitation clear. She was concerned that Sadie might become entangled in the escalating conflict between the Wall and Howe families.
Despite understanding Nanette’s apprehensions, Sadie couldn’t afford to delay. Alex was her friend. She couldn’t just sit by idly if he was in trouble.
“It’s okay. Don’t worry, I’ll be cautious,” Sadie reassured Nanette, giving her a comforting pat on the shoulder. “The studio’s in your hands for now. Call me if anything happens.”
As soon as she was done speaking, Sadie turned and left, her strides hurried and resolute.
“Sadie…” Nanette had more to say, but Sadie didn’t bother to look back.
Nanette could only watch in worry as Sadie’s figure disappeared into the distance. She knew Sadie carried a strong sense of duty toward the people she cared about. Once Sadie made up her mind, there was nothing anyone could do to change it.
Howe Group.
Sadie stood in the opulent lobby, her heart knotting with anxiety as she watched the hustle and bustle of the employees. She headed straight to the reception desk.
“Hello,” she greeted, her tone sounding urgent. “Is Mr. Alex Howe in? My name is Sadie Hudson. I have an appointment with him.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 496:
The receptionist gave her a polite smile. “I’m sorry, Miss Hudson, but Mr. Howe is not seeing anyone today.”
“What?” Sadie frowned and pressed, “Why not? Did something happen to him?”
The receptionist’s pleasant expression turned stiff. She hesitated for a brief moment, only to shake her head in the end. “I’m really sorry, Miss Hudson, but I’m afraid I can’t help you. I am simply following Mr. Howe’s instructions.”
Unwilling to give up, Sadie asked, “Do you know where he is? Or perhaps, can you help me contact his assistant instead?”
The receptionist pressed her lips into a thin, hard line and shook her head again. “Apologies, Miss Hudson. There is nothing I can do. We are not in a position to make queries on Mr. Howe’s whereabouts. His assistant isn’t here, either.”
Sadie’s heart sank. Alex wasn’t seeing anyone, and even his assistant was absent. This only confirmed her suspicions—something had happened to Alex. But she couldn’t even talk to him; what could she do to help?
Sadie spent the next few seconds pacing in front of the reception desk, her thoughts racing. She couldn’t just give up. She had to find a way to see Alex. Just then, her gaze landed on the lounge area situated on one side of the lobby. It was littered with plush-looking couches and coffee tables to accommodate waiting clients or guests.
Steeling herself, Sadie made a decision.
She strode over to the lounge area and chose a seat by the window. Settling down, she fixed her eyes on the elevator banks. Alex couldn’t possibly hide forever. She would just have to wait until he appeared.
The receptionist watched Sadie, noting the latter’s obvious anxiety beneath her composed demeanor. She couldn’t help but feel a bit sympathetic. She had encountered all sorts of people in her line of work, but Sadie was quite rare—clearly a woman of status, yet well-mannered and down-to-earth. After thinking about it for a while, the receptionist picked up the landline phone and dialed.
“Hello, is this the CEO’s office? …Yes, it’s from the reception on the first floor. There’s a Miss Hudson in the lobby, claiming that she has an appointment with Mr. Howe… Yes, Sadie Hudson. She seems very anxious and keeps asking about Mr. Howe’s situation… Oh. Well, I did as instructed and told her that Mr. Howe isn’t seeing anyone today, but she refused to leave. She is waiting in the lounge area as we speak. It looks like she has something important to discuss with Mr. Howe.”
She stole another glance at Sadie before lowering her voice. “Perhaps you could let Mr. Howe know? I see. I understand. All right, thank you.” The receptionist hung up and sighed to herself. At the end of the day, she was just an employee, and she had no desire to get tangled up in the messy lives of the wealthy elite.

Meanwhile, the atmosphere inside Alex’s office was tense. He sat behind his huge desk, his brows furrowed while his fingers drummed a staccato beat on his desk. Alex had just finished a rather intense meeting over the phone, where he had to go over crisis management strategies with several company executives. He had barely ended the call when his assistant came in to relay the message from reception.
“Sadie?” Alex’s lips twitched, a mix of emotions crossing his tired face. “What is she doing here?”
“Apparently, Miss Hudson is very worried and kept asking about you,” the assistant replied cautiously. “The receptionist thinks she has something urgent to discuss with you.”
Alex fell silent. After a long while, he heaved a sigh and said, “No. I won’t see her.” His voice was low and firm. “Tell her I’m not here, and don’t say anything else.”
“But…” The assistant hesitated. “Miss Hudson seems unwilling to leave. She is currently waiting in the lobby.”
“Then let her wait.” This time, Alex’s voice carried a hint of frustration. “She’ll eventually leave on her own.”
Alex didn’t want Sadie to worry, much less get her involved in the dispute he was facing. He understood her nature all too well—she was loyal and generous to the people she valued. If she caught wind that the Howe family was in trouble, she would no doubt do everything she could to lend a hand. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 497:
But Alex couldn’t let her do that. After all, this matter was between the Wall family and the Howe family. He didn’t want to drag her into the mess.
Alex kneaded his throbbing temples and forced himself to focus on the documents before him. He needed to come up with a solution as soon as possible and keep his family’s legacy from collapsing under his watch.
At that same moment, in the Howe Manor, the spacious and bright living room was filled with the rich aroma of food. Susannah stood in the dining hall in an exquisite dress, supervising the servants as they set the table.
Susannah looked much younger than her age, her figure well-maintained and her skin glowing with vitality. Today marked the return of her husband, Terrance Howe, chairman of Howe Group, from overseas. She had arranged for a grand family dinner to celebrate his return.
“Mrs. Howe, dinner is ready. Would you like anything else?” a servant inquired respectfully.
Susannah nodded, pleased. “Hmm, very good. Ensure the K?tl Free—Terrance’s favorite—is perfectly cooked; not too tough, yet not underdone.”
“Understood, Mrs. Howe. We will take care of it.”
Susannah gave the table setting a final inspection, only relaxing when everything met her exacting standards.
Suddenly, hurried footsteps resounded in the living room.noveldrama
“Aunt Susannah! Aunt Susannah!”
Her nephew, Lamont, appeared, urgency etched on his face. He was employed at Howe Group and maintained a good rapport with Alex.
“Lamont? What brings you here?” Susannah questioned, her surprise evident. “What’s the matter? Why such anxiety?”
Catching his breath, Lamont blurted out, “Aunt Susannah, there’s a major problem. The Howe Group is facing a crisis.”
L?tеst chαpt?rs n glнov?ls.со
“What?” Susannah paled, her hand nearly dropping her silk handkerchief. “What did you say? A crisis? How?” Her voice rose sharply, trembling with panic.
“I… I’m not entirely sure…” Lamont hesitated, his voice faltering as he tried to compose himself. “I was with my wife at Vivi’s studio. You remember Vivi, former chief designer at Majestic Ego, the renowned jewelry brand?”
Susannah nodded for him to proceed.
“We were there to discuss some bespoke jewelry we’d ordered. During the visit, I accidentally overheard Vivi on the phone. She mentioned Sadie… it seemed to be connected to the Howe family…”
“Sadie?” The name echoed in Susannah’s thoughts.
“Sadie Hudson?” she exclaimed, her tone laced with disbelief.
“Yes! Exactly! That’s the name.” Lamont confirmed with a slap to his thigh.
“Vivi indicated that because of Sadie, the Howe Group has encountered trouble. She also mentioned the Wall Group has targeted us…”
“The Wall Group?” Susannah’s face grew somber. The name Noah Wall was practically legendary in business circles—everybody knew it. He was known for his ruthless and decisive strategies, his reputation preceding him. If the Wall Group was indeed targeting the Howe Group, the implications were dire. Susannah shuddered at the thought, her body beginning to quiver.
“Where’s Alex? Is he aware of this issue?” she demanded, urgency coloring her voice.
“I don’t know,” Lamont admitted, his expression one of confusion. “I came straight here to inform you after overhearing Vivi’s phone call. Alex hasn’t spoken to me about the company lately…” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 498:
Unable to remain seated, Susannah rose swiftly, snatched her designer handbag from the sofa, and strode toward the exit.
“No! I must go to the company. I need to find Alex and uncover the truth.”
“Aunt Susannah, I’ll accompany you,” Lamont offered, hastening to keep up. Together, they left the villa, climbed into the car, and drove off toward Howe Group.
Meanwhile, in the lobby of Howe Group, Sadie sat on a couch, her gaze locked on the elevator doors. Her heart burned with anxiety and impatience. She could not just sit idly by; she needed to act.
Reaching for her phone, she dialed Alex’s number once more.
“Beep… beep… beep…”
The same long, monotonous tone continued to play. With each passing second, Sadie’s heart sank further.
Just as she was about to lose hope, the elevator from the parking garage chimed. A group of people emerged, among them a figure Sadie recognized instantly.noveldrama
It was Susannah.
Why was Susannah here?
Surprise and confusion washed over Sadie. Before she could rise, Susannah had already seen her.
The moment their eyes met, Susannah’s flashed with icy fury. The click of her high heels echoed against the marble as she approached rapidly. Reaching Sadie, Susannah raised her hand and delivered a stinging slap across her face.
“Pak!”
The sound reverberated through the lobby, drawing all eyes to them. Holding her reddened cheek, Sadie stared at Susannah, stunned.
“You… Why did you hit me?”
Visit gal?vls.com for updates
Around them, onlookers whispered in shock at the sudden incident.
Anger contorted Susannah’s features, and her voice was sharp and accusatory. “Why did I hit you? You dare to ask? Shameless!” Susannah hissed, her voice laced with accusation. “Sadie Hudson, you’ve brought nothing but trouble! You’re the reason the Howe Group is in trouble. How could such turmoil befall us if not for your actions? Humph! You deceitful schemer! Was ensnaring Alex not enough? Now you aim to tear down the Howe Group as well?”
As Susannah spoke, her agitation increased. Her voice grew louder, attracting more onlookers.
“I didn’t!” Sadie shouted, struggling to hold back her tears. “I’ve done nothing wrong.”
The receptionist’s face drained of color in fear. She had never seen such an event unfold. Susannah, usually so dignified and composed, was now uncharacteristically shouting and had even struck another person in public.
Quietly, the receptionist took out her phone and hastily messaged the CEO’s assistant. “Mrs. Howe has hit Miss Hudson in the lobby. The situation is out of control. Please come quickly!”
After sending the text, she looked around nervously, fearing she might be caught.
Sadie’s body trembled, not from fear, but confusion. She straightened, attempting to regain some composure.
“You still dare to deny it?” Susannah sneered, her gaze cutting into Sadie like a poisoned blade. “Sadie Hudson, stop your act! Do you think no one sees the disgraceful things you’ve done? You toyed with Alex’s feelings, played both sides, and made fools out of our Howe family, didn’t you? Now, because of you, the Wall Group is after us. Are you happy? Did you get what you wanted? You shameless bitch!”
As Susannah spoke, she became increasingly upset, tears streaming down her face and her voice turning hoarse.
“Our Howe family… What did we do to deserve such turmoil? To be involved with someone like you…” Susannah cried out, her hands clutching her chest in distress.

###Chapter 499:
“What? The Wall Group is targeting the Howe Group because of her?”noveldrama
“Is that true?”
“Who is she, exactly? How can one person cause so much chaos?”
“I can’t believe this…”
Whispers spread through the crowd, and all eyes were fixed on Sadie, scrutinizing her as if she were under a harsh spotlight.
Feeling exposed and judged by every gaze, Sadie experienced a crushing sense of vulnerability. The pressure felt suffocating.
She staggered back a step, bumping into the couch behind her and nearly falling.
“Noah… Is it really because of me that he’s targeting the Howe Group?” Sadie’s mind reeled as she spoke to herself, her voice tinged with disbelief. The realization struck her like a sudden, harsh blow. She had never anticipated that the situation would escalate to such a degree.
“What’s with that look now? Are you scared?” Susannah mocked Sadie’s dazed and devastated expression, deriving a twisted satisfaction from it and feeling no sympathy. “Stop playing the victim! Do you think that looking innocent will clear you of guilt? No chance! You owe our Howe family!”
Susannah’s relentless tone overwhelmed Sadie.
“I really don’t understand…” Sadie stammered, attempting to defend herself, but Susannah’s biting accusations and the judgmental glares from the crowd left her feeling utterly helpless.
“You don’t? You think ignorance excuses your actions? Do you believe you can deceive us that easily?” Susannah scoffed, her gaze intensifying. “Listen, Sadie, you’re not going anywhere until you tell the truth.”
“Aunt Susannah, please, take a moment to calm down. Don’t let this overwhelm you…” Lamont interjected, standing close and supporting Susannah cautiously, worried she might spiral out of control. While he harbored some resentment towards Sadie, the sight of her so distressed evoked a hint of sympathy. After all, Sadie was the woman his cousin Alex cared deeply about.
Just then, rapid footsteps approached from the elevator.

“What is going on here?” A deep, commanding voice cut through the lobby’s turmoil.
Alex hastened in, urgency and concern marking his features. When he saw the palm print on Sadie’s face and the tears in her eyes, his heart plummeted. He grasped the situation immediately.
“What are you doing, Mom?” Alex confronted Susannah, his voice tinged with reproach. “Sadie is not to blame. Why did you hit her?”
His expression softened as he turned to Sadie, radiating pain and regret.
“Not to blame?! You’re still defending her?” Susannah’s anger intensified when she saw her son side with Sadie. “Alex! Have you lost your senses over this woman? Don’t you see that it’s because of her the Wall Group is targeting us? Do you understand how merciless Noah can be? Our Howe family… We might not survive this…” Susannah’s voice faltered. She was overwhelmed by her emotions.
She pointed at Alex with a shaking finger, her face etched with fury and despair.
“Mom! Please, try to calm down! It’s not as dire as you imagine,” Alex attempted to pacify her. “Don’t overreact. I’ll take care of it…”
“You’ll take care of it? How? With what means?” Susannah’s control shattered.
She pushed Alex aside, her stance unsteady.
“Alex! You’re driving me to despair!”
Susannah suddenly felt dizzy, her vision blurred, and she collapsed to the floor.
“Mom!”
“Aunt Susannah!”
Alex and Lamont cried out in unison, rushing to her side. 
.

###Chapter 500:
“Are you okay, Mom? You’re scaring me.” Alex had never seen his mother so overwhelmed or vulnerable.
Lamont, visibly shaken, tried to revive Susannah by gently tapping her face. His voice was urgent. “Alex, what do we do? Aunt Susannah has fainted.”
“Let’s take her to the hospital!” Alex responded instantly, lifting Susannah’s arms and heading for the door.
Before he left, he gave Sadie a deep, apologetic, and concerned look. “Sadie, I’m sorry… You should leave… I’ll take care of everything here.”
With that, he hurried out with Susannah.
Sadie remained frozen, watching Alex disappear, her emotions in turmoil. She longed to follow, to demand explanations, but found herself unable to move.noveldrama
The crowd around her didn’t disperse with Susannah’s collapse; their chatter intensified.
“Oh my! Isn’t she the one involved with Mr. Wall three years ago?”
“Yes, that’s her! I remember now. The newspapers had photos, accused her of wrecking Kyla and Mr. Wall’s relationship, branding her the other woman.”
“It’s surprising, isn’t it? She appears so innocent, yet she’s been involved in such scandals.”
“Exactly! After Mr. Wall, now Mr. Howe? She’s quite the character.”
“Women like her just have a way with men, don’t they?”
“TSK, TSK. How brazen! And to think she’d show up here, as if she can do whatever she wants with the Howe family.”
“I agree…”
Each biting remark struck Sadie like a sharp jab.
gσv.c?m – check it out!
She bit her lower lip tightly.
Desperately, she wanted to refute the accusations, to proclaim to all that she was not the other woman. Yet, her throat tightened, rendering her speechless. In such a hostile environment, any defense seemed feeble and futile, only inciting further attacks.
In the crowd, a woman in a business suit observed Sadie with cold detachment. Her name was Aliza Perry, a secretary in the CEO’s office at Howe Group and a secret admirer of Alex. Additionally, she was an heiress of the Perry family, who had concealed her true identity to work closely with Alex.
Aliza had watched silently as Alex repeatedly faced problems because of Sadie, fueling a fierce jealousy within her. Today, when she saw Alex defend Sadie against his own mother, resulting in Susannah’s collapse, her jealousy flared uncontrollably. She could not bear seeing the man she loved suffer for a woman she believed to be shameless.
She refused to lose to someone she considered vastly inferior.
“What’s wrong, Aliza? You seem very upset,” a colleague, familiar with her feelings, inquired with concern.
“Nothing,” Aliza responded sharply, turning her back on the unfolding scene. Her eyes narrowed, her lips curling into a sneer. “Sadie, you seem to thrive on attention. Well, I’ll ensure you receive more than you can handle. I’ll see to it that you’re thoroughly disgraced, unable to show your face again,” Aliza vowed silently.
Sadie felt utterly forsaken, isolated in the midst of the crowd. Her body shook, her legs nearly giving way beneath her. She didn’t know how she managed to exit the Howe Group building. The piercing comments followed her, offering no respite.
By the time she reached her studio, it was noon. The employees had left for lunch, leaving the space empty. She staggered to her desk and collapsed into her chair, overwhelmed.
Her mind was a tumultuous whirl of thoughts, intensifying her headache. She struggled to understand how everything had unraveled so disastrously. Noah… Alex… These names pressed heavily on her, suffocating her.

Message from Noah:
Hello, dear readers! Sorry for the delay this week — my birthday was two days ago, and I didn’t have much time to release the chapters.
Two new novels will be released tomorrow. I hope you enjoy them!
God loves you, and Noah wishes you all the best. (?O?=)? ?

###Chapter 501:
Her toxic dynamic with Noah was exhausting enough—now Alex was caught in the crossfire. Sadie was at a loss.
She slowly closed her eyes, tears tracing her cheeks. She reminded herself that she couldn’t afford to lose her composure; she needed to discern the truth.
Alex had been a significant support; she couldn’t abandon him now. She couldn’t just sit idly by. She had to do something for him.
Sadie abruptly stood, the chair screeching against the floor. She was determined and resolved to confront Noah about everything immediately. Grabbing her bag, she rushed to the door. Just as she reached for the handle, the door burst open with a violent kick.
Several burly men with tattooed arms entered, their presence menacing. The leader, his hair bleached blonde and a cigarette dangling from his mouth, eyed Sadie disdainfully.
“You’re Sadie Hudson?” he asked, exhaling a smoke ring arrogantly.
A chill of premonition ran through Sadie. She steeled herself and asked icily, “Who are you? What do you want?”
“What do we want?” The man laughed coldly, flicking his cigarette to the floor. “You’re Noah Wall’s little secret, aren’t you? We’re here to teach you a lesson because someone has a problem with you,” he said ominously.
The term “little secret” infuriated Sadie. Her face paled with anger as she replied sharply, “You’re spreading falsehoods! What I have with Noah is none of your business!”
“Wow, she’s fiery!” one of the thugs said, amused by her spirit. “But we like that.”
The thugs started trashing the studio. They wreaked havoc, overturning tables, demolishing computers, and ripping documents apart.
“Stop! Just stop!” Sadie screamed, her eyes fiery with defiance as she attempted to stop them.

She fought valiantly to protect her workspace. But as a single woman against such brute force, what could she do?
“Move!” one of the thugs barked, pushing Sadie to the floor. Her head struck the ground sharply; pain shot through her, and her vision blurred, nearly rendering her unconscious.
Overcome and exhausted, Sadie tried to grab her phone to call for help, her hands shaking.
The leader acted swiftly, grabbing the phone and crushing it underfoot. The screen burst with a loud crack, fragments flying.
“Thinking of calling the police? How dare you!” he sneered, advancing towards Sadie menacingly.noveldrama
Sadie’s heart sank. She gritted her teeth, fighting back the fear as she glared at him.
“You dare glare at me?” Infuriated by her defiance, the leader grabbed her hair, yanking her up from the floor.
“Let go of me, you jerk!” Sadie struggled desperately, her strength no match for the man’s firm grip.
“I’ll show you who’s in charge!” he bellowed, striking her across the face. Instantly, Sadie’s cheek swelled, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.
Her ears rang, and dizziness overwhelmed her, leaving her barely able to stand.
“Good hit!”
“She brought it upon herself!”
“Teach her a lesson for messing with us!”
The other thugs yelled, encouraging the leader.
Emboldened, the leader picked up a baseball bat and swung it at Sadie’s head. Sadie closed her eyes in despair. 
.

###Chapter 502:
Bang!
With a dull thud, pain exploded in her forehead, and blood streamed down her face.
Sadie collapsed to the floor, knocked out cold.
“Boss… She… She doesn’t seem to be moving…” one thug said nervously, glancing at the motionless Sadie.noveldrama
“Did we… did we kill her?” another thug asked, his voice laced with alarm.
The leader felt a chill run through him. He nudged Sadie with his foot, but she didn’t respond, heightening his anxiety.
“Enough!” he spat. “Let’s get out of here.”
Relieved, the thugs quickly followed him out of the studio, leaving chaos behind.
The studio was a disaster zone: papers, drawings, shattered glass, and broken wood scattered everywhere, the air thick with the smell of blood and dust. Sadie lay sprawled on the floor, bloodied and battered, a distressing sight.
Two hours later…
“Those fools must wish for death, daring to touch Mr. Wall’s woman.” Having worked with Noah for years, Arlo Blake, the head of the bodyguard team, was accustomed to big scenes. But the sight before him made his scalp tingle. He had thought that, in broad daylight, with Mr. Wall’s specific instructions to protect Sadie, nothing could go wrong.
His team had been nearby, unwinding and chatting, not anticipating such rapid chaos.
Sadie’s studio looked as though it had been plowed by a herd of wild bulls. The place was devastated, littered with papers, shattered glass, and broken wood, thick with the smell of blood and dust.
Sadie lay amidst a pool of blood, her pale face and wounded body painting a gruesome scene.
Lаt?st chαpt?rs in g?lnov?ls.?οm
Blood stained Sadie’s white blouse.
Arlo’s mind went blank, as if struck by lightning.
“Mrs. Wall? Mrs. Wall!” The usually stoic bodyguards now spoke with trembling voices and teary eyes. They were Noah’s most trusted protectors, responsible for his safety as well as the safety of his loved ones. Yet, under their watch, Sadie had suffered serious injuries. Would they even survive Noah’s wrath?
Arlo slapped himself hard. “What are you doing standing there? Call an ambulance now!” He regained his senses and barked the order at the other stunned bodyguards.
Snapping out of their daze, they scrambled to dial emergency services. “Mrs. Wall, wake up! Hang in there! The ambulance is on its way.” Arlo knelt beside Sadie, his voice shaking as he tried to wake her.
But Sadie lay still, her eyes closed, her breathing barely perceptible.
“Alert! Everyone, go to full alert and lock down the area!” Arlo composed himself and began issuing orders with precision. “You—retrieve all surveillance footage from here! And you, ask the locals if they noticed anything unusual. The rest of you, stay here and secure the scene until the police arrive.”
The bodyguards sprang into action, and the studio’s atmosphere tensed.
The sharp ring of a phone pierced the solemnity of the boardroom where Noah was leading a shareholders’ meeting. Everyone had been sitting upright, listening intently to his speech. Noah frowned; interruptions during meetings irked him.
But when he saw the caller ID—Samuel—his heart raced. Samuel, his most trusted aide, would only call now for an urgent matter.
Noah gestured for a pause, stood, and left the boardroom to answer the call.
“Mr. Wall…” Samuel’s voice came through, urgent and shaky.
“What’s happened?” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 503:
A wave of apprehension washed over Noah.
“Mr. Wall… Mrs. Wall… Something’s happened to her…” Samuel’s voice quivered as he struggled to remain composed.
“What?” Noah’s voice spiked with disbelief and anger. “What did you say? Say that again!”
“Mr. Wall, Mrs. Wall was attacked in her studio. She’s now unconscious and has been rushed to the hospital for emergency care…” Samuel’s voice faded to a whisper.
The phone slipped from Noah’s grasp and crashed to the floor.
He stood motionless, his mind reeling.
Sadie was attacked? Unconscious? How could that be possible?
Hadn’t he assigned bodyguards to protect her in secret? What had they been doing?
Noah was overwhelmed with fury, his chest heaving.
He turned sharply and strode back into the boardroom.noveldrama
“The meeting is adjourned!” he announced coldly. “Everyone, stay here.” Without looking back, he exited, leaving the shareholders in a state of confusion.
“What’s wrong?”
“What happened?”
“No idea. I’ve never seen Mr. Wall so unsettled…”
“Can he just leave a shareholders’ meeting? Like this?”
“Shh! Just wait here, like he said.”
“Alas…”
Your next story begins at . com
The whispers filled the room as the shareholders speculated, but no one dared to say too much.
Noah’s command in Wall Group was unchallenged.
Thus, they sat silently, awaiting his return.
The Rolls-Royce Phantom sliced through the quiet night.
Noah, sitting in the back, exuded an air of tension and menace.
His lips were set in a firm line, his eyes ablaze with both intense anger and palpable concern.
“Give me the full story. What happened?”
Samuel, seated in the passenger seat, wiped the sweat from his forehead.
He turned hesitantly and said, “Mr. Wall, the details… I’m not entirely sure…”
“Not sure?” Noah’s voice sharpened as he slammed his hand onto the seat. “You’re my chief assistant, and you can’t get information on something this critical?”
“Mr. Wall… I’m… I’m still gathering details…” Samuel’s voice faltered, as he nearly broke into tears.
Noah’s fury was unlike anything Samuel had witnessed before.
Usually strict, Noah now seemed like a volcano on the verge of eruption.
“If you don’t have answers by the end of today, be ready to resign.”
“I understand, Mr. Wall. I will find out,” Samuel responded, his voice trembling with the promise.
“What about the security detail for Sadie?” Noah asked, his tone slightly controlled yet still intense.
“It was a lapse by the bodyguards,” Samuel replied cautiously.
“A lapse?” Noah’s eyebrows knitted together tightly. “They’re utterly incompetent!”
“Get rid of them all,” Noah said.
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” Samuel replied immediately, fully aware of the weight behind Noah’s directive.

###Chapter 504:
In Noah’s world, mercy held no place.
His decisions were absolute, designed to eliminate any future threat. Now, with Sadie’s safety compromised, Noah had reached his breaking point. Samuel knew the outcome for the bodyguards would be grim, but he obeyed without hesitation.
As the car sped down the highway, Noah sat in the back, fists clenched, veins prominent—clear signs of his mounting anxiety.
Images of Sadie plagued his mind.
He couldn’t bear the thought of losing her.
Three years ago, he had already lost her once. He wouldn’t survive it again.
“Faster,” he urged the driver in a hoarse whisper, desperate to be by Sadie’s side.
At the hospital, the red glow of the emergency room sign burned into Noah’s vision.
He stood rooted outside the door, paralyzed.
Every passing second dragged like an eternity.
It felt as though something were crushing his chest, making it hard to breathe.
This kind of fear was unfamiliar to him—the fear of losing her.
Suddenly, the doors creaked open. Noah snapped to attention.
“Doctor! How is she?” he asked, his voice raw with urgency.
The doctor removed his mask, his expression grim.
“Mr. Wall, her condition is precarious.”
“What?” Noah’s heart dropped.
“What did you say? Please repeat that.”
“She has suffered a severe head injury and significant intracranial bleeding, which has caused a large clot impacting her nervous system…” the doctor explained, his tone grave. “We’ve done all we can, but whether she wakes up remains uncertain…”
“What do you mean by uncertain? Are you certain of your uncertainty?” Noah’s tone intensified. “I need assurances, doctor. She must survive. Understand?” Noah seized the doctor by the tie, hoisting him into the air, his eyes fiery with fury.
“If she dies, this hospital will be held accountable,” he said, his voice icy and unyielding.
The doctor struggled for breath under Noah’s intimidating presence. Trembling with fear, he had never witnessed such a terrifying side of Noah and was certain of the dire consequences if Sadie’s condition worsened.
“Mr… Mr. Wall… please… let’s remain calm!” the doctor said. “We… we will do everything we can.”noveldrama
“That’s not enough; ensure she survives. I need her unharmed! Do you understand?”
“Yes, I understand.” The doctor nodded hastily, too frightened to contradict. “Then get back to work! Keep trying to save her!” Noah thrust the doctor back towards the emergency room.
“Bang!”
With a loud bang, the doors swung shut, the red light glaring once more. Noah remained at the door, fists clenched so tightly that his nails drew blood from his palms, though he was unaware of the pain.
“Samuel!” he called out in a raspy tone.
“Right here, Mr. Wall,” Samuel said promptly.
“Contact the top neurosurgeons globally. Bring them here immediately, regardless of the cost. We must save Sadie.”
“Absolutely, Mr. Wall. I’m on it,” Samuel said, quickly dialing numbers on his phone.
Eighteen hours ticked by.
During that time, Noah didn’t eat or drink; he stood guard, unflinchingly vigilant outside the emergency room. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 505:
His appearance was gaunt, eyes bloodshot, face ashen, and lips cracked, showing signs of severe exhaustion.
Yet, he remained undeterred, eyes glued to the sealed doors, his mind solely on Sadie.
After what seemed an eternity, the ominous red light finally turned off.
“Squeak!”
The doors creaked open.
The doctor emerged, his face etched with a weary but hopeful smile. “Mr. Wall, the surgery was successful. We’ve completely removed the blood clot from the patient’s brain, and she’s no longer in immediate danger.”
“Currently?” Noah’s expression tightened, his voice rough. “What does that mean?”
“The immediate threat is gone, but due to the severity of the brain injury, it’s uncertain when, or even if, she will regain consciousness,” the doctor explained in a somber tone. “You should brace yourself for all possibilities.”
Noah remained silent for a moment. “Move her to the best ward. I’ll oversee her recovery myself,” he stated firmly.
“Certainly, Mr. Wall,” the doctor replied promptly.
In the VIP ward, Sadie lay still, her complexion ghostly, her vitality seemingly drained. Her head was swathed in thick bandages, and her body was connected to a series of tubes, presenting a picture of vulnerability.
Noah sat next to her, holding her hand with a steadfast grip.
“Sadie, I’m so sorry…” His voice broke, filled with regret. “This is my fault. Please wake up. You have to wake up, okay? There’s so much more I need to tell you…”
He paused, his voice thick with emotion, and added, “When you wake up, we… you, Averi, and I… we’ll never be separated again.” Noah gently kissed Sadie’s cold forehead.
Stay tuned at gα?ησνs?com
At that moment, his phone disrupted the solemn silence of the room. He checked the caller ID—it was Samuel.
Regaining his composure, Noah answered.
“Mr. Wall, we’ve apprehended those thugs,” Samuel said.
“Good,” Noah responded quietly, his tone flat.
After ending the call, he stood, looking down at Sadie with a complex mix of emotions. He tenderly held her hand, then brought it to his lips for a gentle kiss.
“Sadie, just wait for me here, okay?” His voice was soft and reassuring. “I’ll be back soon.”
With one last lingering kiss, he left the ward.
“Guard her well. Allow no disturbances,” Noah said with an icy, authoritative tone that brooked no argument.
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” the bodyguards at the door replied in unison, their voices resonating with firm resolve.
The corridor outside the VIP ward was lined with Noah’s men, each positioned like a sentry, their presence forming an impenetrable barrier. Their vigilance was unyielding.
Noah’s steps were steady as he walked down the corridor, his presence exuding a palpable tension. His expression was grim and intimidating. If Noah had once resembled a refined gentleman, he now radiated a dangerously lethal aura.
He was resolute in seeking retribution against those who had hurt Sadie. Exiting the hospital, Noah entered his black Rolls-Royce Phantom, which swiftly carried him towards the city’s outskirts.
At a desolate, abandoned factory, once a bustling site for manufacturing mechanical parts but now a shell due to mismanagement, the atmosphere was thick with neglect. Cobwebs and dust adorned the walls, while the floor was strewn with debris and rusted parts. The stench of decay pervaded the air.noveldrama
A few dim incandescent lamps flickered weakly, casting just enough light to illuminate a small section of the factory. 
.

.
###Chapter 506:
“Argh! Stop hitting me! Please, just stop!”
“It hurts so much… I swear I don’t know anything… Please…”
“We wouldn’t dare wreck Mrs. Wall’s studio… We’re innocent…”
The plaintive sounds echoed off the factory walls.
Eight thugs lay bound on the floor, their faces swollen and marred by blood and grime, their expressions one of abject misery.
Encircling them were a dozen of Noah’s bodyguards, clad in black suits, who wielded steel pipes and clubs with ruthless efficiency.
“Tell me, who sent you?” Samuel demanded harshly, standing to the side with his arms crossed.
As Noah’s right-hand man, Samuel managed not just business affairs but also Noah’s security and the darker, more secretive aspects. Accustomed to dealing with the grim realities of his role, Samuel had become cold and calculating, devoid of sympathy for those who threatened Noah’s domain.
“We… we honestly don’t know…”
“We’re just small-time thugs, used to hassling local businesses and brawling… We wouldn’t dare cross the Wall Group.”
“We’re truly innocent… Please, show us some mercy…”
The leader pleaded, his face bruised and swollen beneath bandaged wraps, tears streaming down his cheeks. Known on the streets as “Scarface,” he had a reputation for his arrogance and for bullying the weak. Today, however, he faced a grave reversal of fortune. He never envisioned such a dire predicament.
“Still acting tough, huh?” Samuel sneered, his impatience evident. He nodded to the bodyguards.
“Continue until they confess.”
Dive into the story world at gα?ησvs?c?m
“Understood, Mr. Ford,” the bodyguards replied in unison, their strikes resonating through the air.
“Bang! Bang! Bang!”
“Ah…”
Groans of pain and the sound of blunt force filled the factory, a chilling symphony. The thugs were battered severely, their features almost unrecognizable.
“I’ll talk… we were paid to trash Sadie Hudson’s studio…”noveldrama
“Yeah, it was just for the money… we don’t even know who Sadie Hudson is…”
“Please… spare us… It won’t happen again…”
Under severe duress, the thugs capitulated, pleading for mercy.
“Who hired you?” Samuel’s tone was icy as he narrowed his eyes.
“It was…” Scarface began, then hesitated, his eyes widening with fear. He clammed up, terrified. Speaking that person’s name meant not only his death but danger to his family as well.
He knew the person’s cruelty firsthand—a ruthlessness far exceeding the pain inflicted now.
“Speak! Who sent you?”
Seeing Scarface hesitate, Samuel grew even more certain of a larger conspiracy at play.
He stepped forward, seized Scarface by the collar, and hoisted him off the ground, demanding fiercely, “Talk now! Or it ends here for you!”
Scarface shivered, his complexion ghostly. He opened his mouth but failed to speak the name.
“Bang!”
Suddenly, the factory door burst open with a resounding crash, jolting everyone inside.

###Chapter 507:
A tall, imposing figure appeared in the doorway, outlined against the backlight. He wore a black shirt, slightly unbuttoned at the top to reveal a glimpse of his collarbone and muscular chest.
His expression was steely and detached.
“Mr. Wall?” Samuel was taken aback by Noah’s unexpected arrival.
He had not anticipated Noah would come himself.
“Mr. Wall, what are you doing here?” Samuel approached quickly, his tone deferential.
“Have they spoken yet?”
Noah disregarded Samuel’s question, his gaze fixed on the subdued thugs.
“Well…”
Samuel appeared embarrassed and uneasy.
He averted his eyes, unable to meet Noah’s stern look.
“Not yet…”
“Useless!” Noah’s rebuke was sharp and unforgiving.
Samuel’s complexion went from pale to flushed. He clenched his fists, nails digging into his palms, yet he held back any response.
Aware of Noah’s irritable mood, he knew better than to further provoke him.
Noah then turned away from Samuel and approached Scarface directly. The bodyguards, grasping the situation, hoisted Scarface to his feet, holding him tightly.
Scarface, gripped by fear and despair, looked up at Noah, his eyes filled with dread.noveldrama
He realized he was doomed.
Noah’s overwhelming presence pressed down on him, making it difficult to breathe. It felt as though Noah’s piercing gaze could reduce him to ashes.
“It’s… It’s…” Scarface stammered, his lips quivering.
Noah watched him silently, his gaze devoid of emotion.
“Please… have mercy… I’ll talk… someone paid us…” Crushed by the weight of Noah’s stare, Scarface spoke, his words a desperate, incoherent plea.
Observing this, Samuel picked up a nearby baseball bat and handed it to Noah. He examined the bat, then slowly pressed it against Scarface’s neck, the cold metal making him shiver with fear.
“I’ll talk… I’ll tell you everything…” Overwhelmed, Scarface confessed all he knew. “It was Susannah Howe… She sent us…”
“Susannah Howe?” Noah’s expression darkened slightly. He was puzzled.
“She’s Alex Howe’s mother,” Scarface hurriedly explained, worried about any misunderstanding. “It was her… She paid us a lot… told us to vandalize Sadie’s studio… and also to…”
“To do what?” Noah’s tone dropped, chilling the air.
“To… disfigure Sadie… she said… even to kill her…” Scarface’s voice trembled in terror as he spoke.
Bang!
With a swift motion, Noah swung the bat, striking Scarface’s head.
“Ah!” Scarface screamed sharply before collapsing, his condition unclear.
Noah looked on impassively.
He coldly surveyed Scarface on the ground, as if he were mere debris.
“Sever the hand that harmed Sadie, and his legs too,” Noah said emotionlessly. He tossed the bat back to Samuel; the clatter of metal resounded through the stark factory.
“Take the others to the police. Make sure none escapes,” Noah added firmly. 
.

###Chapter 508:
“Yes, Mr. Wall,” Samuel replied, motioning to the bodyguards who promptly began to drag the thugs away.
“No… please… Have mercy!”
“We won’t do it again, we promise! Please!”
“Please…”
The thugs screamed in terror, their cries desperate and hopeless.
They struggled fiercely, but the bodyguards’ firm grip rendered their efforts futile.
Samuel, understanding the urgency, quickly caught up to Noah, who had already begun to walk away.
He matched Noah’s pace and spoke in a hushed tone. “Mr. Wall, on the morning of the incident, Mrs. Wall visited the Howe Group.”
Noah’s stride faltered briefly, but he continued forward, his tall figure casting a long shadow in the dim light.
Samuel added, “It’s rumored that Mrs. Wall was humiliated by Mrs. Howe at the Howe Group.”
“Humph!” Noah let out a sharp, cold laugh, filled with mockery and disdain. “The Howe Group… seems they wish for their end.”
He stopped abruptly, turned to Samuel, and said with measured emphasis, “Cease all civility with the Howe Group.”
Feeling the weight of Noah’s intense gaze, Samuel bowed slightly and said, “Understood, Mr. Wall.”
He recognized the depth of Noah’s fury this time.
The Howe Group’s fate seemed sealed.
Without another word, Noah turned and swiftly exited the abandoned factory.

Noah slammed the gas pedal as he got into the car.
He gripped the steering wheel tightly, his knuckles turning white with the force of his hold.
He sped down the road toward the hospital, consumed by anger, unable to contain it.
The humiliation Sadie had suffered at the Howe Group gnawed at him. Moreover, he couldn’t forgive himself for letting her face it alone.
“Damn it!” he yelled, hitting the steering wheel with a loud “bang.”
The car screeched to a stop at the hospital entrance.
Noah burst from the car and strode toward the inpatient department, his icy demeanor parting the crowd around him.
Approaching the floor where Sadie was, he noticed a commotion ahead.
“Why won’t you let me in? I’m Sadie’s friend!” a frantic male voice called out.
“I’m sorry, sir. Mr. Wall has instructed that no visitors are allowed without his permission,” a bodyguard replied in a detached tone.
“Her friend? Humph!” Noah scoffed, quickening his stride.
It was Alex.
Noah immediately recognized the man heatedly arguing with the bodyguards at the department door.
Alex looked wild-eyed and unkempt, his eyes red and swollen.noveldrama
He was shoving against the guards, desperate to get inside.
“Move! I need to see Sadie! How is she now? You bastards! Fuck off!” His voice cracked with rage as he struggled against the bodyguards’ hold.
“Please calm down, Mr. Howe!”
Despite the bodyguards’ efforts, Alex’s strength made him difficult to restrain.

###Chapter 509:
“Calm down? How can I calm down? You’re all just Noah’s lackeys. I want to see him. I want to know why he’s done this to Sadie,” Alex bellowed, continuing to fight.
He had rushed to the hospital after a distressing call from Nanette about the studio incident.
Upon arrival, police updates about Sadie’s condition had driven him to frantic efforts to see her.noveldrama
Alex, stopped outside Sadie’s room, was nearly driven to madness.
He was eager to see Sadie and learn of her condition, his emotions boiling over.
“Bang!”
In a moment of fury, Alex landed a solid punch on a bodyguard’s face.
Caught off guard, the guard staggered, nearly collapsing.
“You…” the guard hissed, clutching his face.
“Mr. Howe, quite the display of strength!” a cold voice called out.
Noah had arrived, standing at the end of the corridor, hands in his pockets, his gaze icy.
His slightly tousled hair added to his intense presence.
“Noah Wall!”
Seeing him, Alex’s eyes reddened, and he gritted his teeth. “You finally show up.” He shrugged off the guards and charged at Noah.
“Noah, are you even a man? Attacking a woman instead of facing me?” Alex shouted, seizing Noah by the collar, his voice thick with anger and frustration.
“Let go,” Noah commanded, his voice unnervingly calm.
“I won’t!” Alex bellowed. “You owe me answers today! What happened to Sadie? What did you do to her?”
Step into fiction with gα?ησν?so
“Answers?” Noah scoffed. “What claim do you have to demand them from me?” He quickly broke free from Alex’s grasp.
“You…” Alex faltered, nearly falling over.
“Listen, Alex Howe,” Noah advanced, his tone menacing. “Sadie is my wife. You have no right to interfere.”
“Your wife?” Alex laughed bitterly. “Noah, don’t forget, Sadie…”
“Bang!”
Before Alex could finish, Noah struck him squarely in the face.
Alex reeled back, crashing against the wall with a heavy “thud.”
“Mr. Wall!”
“Mr. Howe!”
The bodyguards stood frozen, shocked by the confrontation unfolding before them. They hesitated, uncertain of what to do next.
Two influential figures… actually brawling.
What were they supposed to do now?
“You…” Alex clutched his face, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth as he stared at Noah in disbelief.
“Surprised I hit you? I wish I could do worse,” Noah’s voice seethed with anger as he stepped closer to Alex, his gaze fierce.
“Alex, how dare you question me? How was Sadie hurt? Don’t you know? Ask your dear mother! Ask her what she’s done to Sadie!”
“My mother?” Alex’s confusion was palpable, his expression bewildered. “What do you mean?”
“What do I mean?” Noah scoffed, suddenly seizing Alex by the collar and hoisting him off the floor.

###Chapter 510:
“Listen carefully, Alex. If you weren’t Averi’s biological father, you’d be dead already.”
Noah’s enunciation of “Averi’s biological father” carried a venom that underscored his deep loathing.
He hated Alex to the core.
He despised Alex for the anguish Sadie endured.
And he resented even more that Alex was Averi’s father.
This fact was a thorn in his heart, a source of relentless agony.
“You…”
Overpowered by Noah’s dominating presence, Alex opened his mouth but found himself speechless.
“Fuck off!” Noah pushed Alex away with force.
“You have no right to see her. From this moment on, stay away from Sadie and me, or I won’t hold back.”
Reeling from the shove, Alex staggered back, his complexion ashen, his lips trembling. “Noah… you…”
He tried to speak, but it was as if his throat was sealed, no sound escaping.
“You all, keep watch!” Noah commanded the bodyguards stationed at the door. “Without my express permission, no one is allowed to approach this hospital room. Anyone who tries, break their legs and throw them out!”
“Understood, Mr. Wall!” the bodyguards answered in unison.
Their gazes upon Alex were filled with vigilance and undisguised hostility. Alex looked from Noah to the formidable bodyguards, realizing he wouldn’t get past them today.
With a heavy heart, he turned and slowly walked away.

The harsh, clinical lights of the hospital corridor cast long shadows behind his retreating figure.
His footsteps echoed, growing fainter until they were swallowed by the silence of the corridor, the tension finally beginning to ease.
At the Howe family’s elegant villa, the soft glow of a crystal chandelier bathed the living room in warm light.
Susannah reclined on a plush leather sofa, delicately using a silver fork to enjoy a slice of cantaloupe.
“Mmm. This cantaloupe is so sweet,” she murmured, closing her eyes in delight, a content smile playing on her lips.
Beside her, Terrance was engrossed in a financial newspaper, casting occasional admiring glances her way.
“If you enjoy it, have some more,” Terrance’s voice was deep and gentle.
“Certainly,” Susannah replied, picking up another slice.
Nearby, a young girl in an off-white dress sat quietly, her long hair flowing over her shoulders, radiating a serene grace.
This was Aliza. She watched Susannah and Terrance with a gentle smile, appearing every bit the obedient daughter.
“Aliza, try some too,” Susannah suggested warmly.
“Thank you, Mrs. Howe,” Aliza responded, taking a small bite of an apple.
“Don’t mention it. We’re like family here,” Susannah said, teasing her lightly.
Bang!
Suddenly, the tranquility was shattered by a loud crash as the villa’s front door was violently swung open.
Alex stormed in, his face marred by bruises and a blood-stained lip. His suit was wrinkled, reflecting his disarray. Yet, more alarming than his disheveled appearance was the cold fury in his eyes.

###Chapter 511:
“Alex? What happened to you?”
Startled, Susannah dropped her silver fork, the clatter sending a cantaloupe slice rolling off the table.
“Alex, who did you get into a fight with?” Terrance set down his newspaper and frowned deeply at his son.
Aliza rose, her expression etched with concern for Alex.
Ignoring their reactions, Alex approached Susannah, his glare as cold as ice. “Why did you hurt her?” he demanded, his voice a low growl of suppressed anger.
“Hurt who?” Susannah responded, bewildered. “Alex, what are you talking about? Who did I hurt?”
“Sadie!” Alex’s voice escalated into a roar. “Why did you hurt Sadie?”
“Sadie?” Confusion clouded Susannah’s face. “When have I ever hurt her? Alex, are you sure you’re not misunderstanding something? Did Sadie say something to you? Is she trying to drive a wedge between us?”
Tears began streaming down Susannah’s cheeks as she spoke, her face the picture of distress.
“Enough!” Alex cut her off with another roar. “You’re still denying it? You think I’m unaware? Sadie almost died because of what you did.”
“What?” Shock widened Susannah’s eyes. “Alex, what are you talking about? How could I possibly have…?”
“Enough! I’ve heard enough denials!” Disgust laced Alex’s words.
Overwhelmed, Susannah tried to speak but faltered, her fear evident.
“Alex! How can you speak to your mother this way?” Terrance rose abruptly, his finger jabbing in the air towards Alex as he scolded, “Your mother is frail, and you should be more thoughtful. Are you trying to give her a heart attack?”
“Dad! How can you still defend her?”

Disappointment was clear in Alex’s voice as he faced Terrance. “Do you even know what she’s done? She…”
“What did she do? Tell me now!” Terrance’s demand echoed louder. “She’s your mother, Alex. Whatever she’s done, she did it for you. Can’t you see that?”
“For me?” Alex’s laugh erupted suddenly, filled with bitterness. “Really now? So hurting the woman I love is for my own good? Is that what you call it? Huh?”
“You…” Terrance, at a loss for words, trembled as he pointed at his son. “Fine. Fine…”
Alex’s eyes grew colder, his voice deeper. “Since you say so, I have nothing more to add. If you ever hurt Sadie again, I won’t forgive you.” With that, he turned away.
“Alex! You… stop right there!” Susannah finally reacted, screaming as she tried to grab him.
“Alex… Alex…” She broke down in tears.
She had never imagined things would turn out this way.
She had only slapped Sadie twice across her face. How had it escalated to this? That troublemaker! She must be behind all this.
“Mrs. Howe, please don’t cry…” Aliza approached Susannah and gently patted her back, offering comfort.
“Please, Mrs. Howe, don’t cry. Alex was just acting on impulse. He’ll come around,” Aliza whispered.noveldrama
“Really?” Susannah looked up, her eyes brimming with hope.
“Yes, truly,” Aliza assured her, nodding. “I’ll speak with him.”
Alex gazed at Aliza, his expression blank.
“You… why are you here?” he asked, his voice hoarse and his eyes clouded with confusion. 
.

###Chapter 512:
“Alex.” Terrance cleared his throat with two sharp coughs before continuing, “Aliza is Elbert’s daughter, and now she’s your fiancée.”
Though Terrance spoke quietly, his words struck Alex like a thunderclap.
“My fiancée?” Alex’s shock was palpable; he looked from Aliza to his father, his face ghostly.
“Dad, what are you talking about? What fiancée? Why am I only hearing about this now?”
“This arrangement was made long ago between Elbert and me,” Terrance explained, his voice steady with authority.
“NO!” Alex responded instantly.
“No?” Terrance’s sneer was tinged with disdain. “Remember, Alex, you are a howe. You don’t get to choose your bride.”
“I…” Alex began, only to be interrupted by Aliza.
“Alex, please stay calm.” She stepped in front of him, speaking softly, as though she were placating a child. “I know you’re upset right now, but our families have decided this. We need to respect that.”
“Shut up!” Alex shot her an icy glare. “This is my personal business, nothing to do with you.”
He shoved past the servant who stood in his way and stormed out of the house without a single backward glance.
Behind him, Aliza’s cries and Terrance’s furious shouts echoed, but Alex didn’t care.
In the end, Aliza could only stand there in a daze, desperate tears streaming down her face. She had never imagined that Alex would cause such a scene at home—all for a woman.
“Aliza, don’t be upset.” Terrance walked up to her and patted her shoulder. “Alex is just confused at the moment. Once he cools off and thinks things through, he will come to accept you.”
“Mr. Howe…” Aliza looked up at him, her eyes brimming with fresh tears. “Do you really think so?”
“Definitely,” Terrance declared. “This marriage was decided between our families a long time ago. It’s set in stone, a done deal. Nothing can change it.”
“But…” Aliza trailed off and bit her lower lip.
“No buts!” Terrance’s voice rose slightly. “Look, don’t worry, all right? The Howe family will only recognize you as Alex’s future wife.”noveldrama
“Thank you, Mr. Howe,” Aliza choked out, though his reassurance did nothing to calm her heart. She knew Alex all too well. He wasn’t the type to relent once he made up his mind. If he was truly determined to be with Sadie, what was she to do? No. She couldn’t let that happen. She had waited so many years for this moment. She refused to lose to Sadie.
The thought brought a newfound determination to Aliza, and her eyes flashed with a surprisingly ruthless glint. Gradually, she calmed down and wiped away her tears.
“I’ll head back now,” she said. “Have a good night, Mr. and Mrs. Howe.”
“All right, my dear. Be careful on your way,” Terrance replied with a kind nod. Aliza left the villa and got into her car. However, instead of starting the engine, she took out her phone and made a call.
“Hello?” A nervous voice came through the line after just one ring.
“Something terrible has happened, Miss Perry!”
“What is it?”
“The people we sent to trash Sadie’s studio,” the other person said, their voice trembling with fear. “They were caught by Noah.”
“What?” All the color drained from Aliza’s face. “That can’t be true!”
“But it is, Miss Perry. None of our men escaped. Noah rounded them all up.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 513:
“How is that possible?” Aliza muttered, her mind going blank. Hadn’t she paid those thugs to leave town? How did Noah catch them all?
“What’s the situation now?” Aliza forced the words out, her heart hammering in her chest.
“Sadie is still in the hospital,” came the reply. “As for our men, they managed not to implicate you.”
“What did they say?” Aliza’s voice was barely above a whisper.
“They… They said it was Mrs. Susannah Howe who sent them.”
“Susannah?” Aliza repeated, momentarily taken aback. Then she understood. Earlier, when Alex returned home, he had angrily questioned Susannah about why she had hurt Sadie. So that was why.
Aliza finally breathed a sigh of relief as her tense nerves relaxed. “At least they had the sense not to mention my name.”
Things were fine as long as those thugs kept her name out of the matter.
“Miss Perry, what should we do now?” the person asked, worry and trepidation clear in their voice.
“What do you mean, what we should do?” Aliza snapped. “Since they said it was Susannah, let Noah and the authorities believe it was her.”
“But—”
“I don’t want to hear any buts!” Aliza interrupted sharply. “From now on, the incident has nothing to do with us. Do you understand?”
“Hmm. I understand.”
“Good. I have to go.” With that, Aliza hung up.
She leaned back in her seat, closed her eyes, and let out a long breath.
galnσvs.?m – your update hub
Sadie… Aliza wished that the woman would never wake up again.
Meanwhile, at the hospital, the steady sound of the heart monitor echoed: Beep… Beep… Beep…
The piercing sound of the alarm shattered the tranquil silence inside the room.noveldrama
The once steady EKG line suddenly went wild, moving in an erratic pattern.
“Oh, no! The patient is going into cardiac arrest!”
The doctor on duty turned pale as he rushed to Sadie’s bedside, quickly assessing her condition.
“Prepare the defibrillator! Administer one milligram of adrenaline intravenously!”
The nurses sprang into action. In the blink of an eye, an entire team was working rapidly inside the room, and the air grew heavy with tension.
Noah jolted awake from the cot, his eyes immediately going to the monitor. It felt as though his own heart struggled to beat as he watched the fluctuating line on the screen.
“What’s happening?” he shouted in alarm, barely recognizing his own voice amid the panic.
“Please stay calm, Mr. Wall. We’re doing everything we can for the patient,” the doctor tried to reassure Noah, keeping his focus on the defibrillator equipment they were setting up.
“What the hell!” Noah shoved a nurse aside and scrambled to Sadie’s side. His eyes were red and wild with desperation as he reached for her pale face.
“Wake up, Sadie! Do you hear me? You can’t die. I can’t lose you. Wake up!”
Noah couldn’t even begin to imagine what he would do if Sadie left him like this. He didn’t dare to think about it.
“Stand back! Ready!” The doctor adjusted the voltage before positioning the paddles on Sadie’s chest. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 514:
“Clear!” Bang!
Sadie’s body jerked violently. The line on the monitor remained erratic.
“Second charge. Ready! Clear!” Bang!
The medical team repeated the process once more.
Each time Sadie jerked, Noah felt a spark of hope, but then she would fall back onto the bed, limp and lifeless, and his heart would sink with hers.
Noah could feel his legs weakening beneath him. The tips of his fingers had gone cold and clammy.
He clasped Sadie’s hand and whispered over and over, “Sadie, wake up… Please… Wake up… Sadie, I was wrong… I was so wrong… I shouldn’t have treated you like that..I shouldn’t have doubted you… Wake up, please. I swear, I will do anything you ask. Just open your eyes… Please…”
His words faltered toward the end, his tears streaming freely down his face.
It was the first time he allowed himself to be vulnerable in front of others—in front of a woman, no less.
“Third charge. Ready!” The doctor’s voice rang out again, sounding more grave now. It was their last attempt. If Sadie’s heart didn’t stabilize, they might lose her.
“Clear!” Bang!
Noah’s heart seemed to stop in time with Sadie’s body. He felt time itself freeze.noveldrama
One second, two seconds, three seconds…
It felt like a lifetime, a century, an eternity.
Beep—Beep—Beep—
The monitor showed a steady heartbeat, a normal line.
Your next journey starts at g?lnσνso
“The patient is stable!” a nurse cried out.
A collective sigh of relief swept through the medical team. The doctor leaned against the bed, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
Noah, however, was still in a daze. He stared at the monitor, unable to react.
“Are you all right, Mr. Wall?” the doctor asked, his concern evident.
But Noah didn’t respond. He just tightened his grip on Sadie’s hand and pressed his thumb gently against the faint pulse on her wrist. Sadie wasn’t completely out of danger yet, but she was alive.
That was enough. It had to be enough—for now.
As long as she was alive, there was still hope.
Noah stayed by Sadie’s bedside for the next three days. He didn’t eat or drink, his attention never straying from the heart monitor. He didn’t want to miss even the slightest change.
He sat motionless, like a statue. The only signs that he was alive were the steady rise and fall of his chest and the occasional flutter of his lashes as he battled his inner demons.
His eyes were sunken, and the stubble on his chin had grown, making him look haggard and desolate.
“Mr. Wall, you haven’t been back to the company for several days now,” Samuel said quietly from the doorway. “The board isn’t pleased.”
He had tried to persuade Noah multiple times to at least stop by Wall Group to handle urgent matters, but Noah remained steadfast in his refusal.
“How are things at the company?” Noah croaked.
“Everything is more or less normal. However…” Samuel trailed off, obviously hesitant.
Noah’s brows furrowed in suspicion. “However?”
“The board is extremely dissatisfied with your absence. Word is that they are conspiring behind your back to… well, to overthrow you.” Samuel finished, bracing himself for Noah’s fury. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 515:
A cold, cruel glint flickered in Noah’s eyes. “What about the Howe Group?”
Samuel’s expression turned grim. “The Howe Group has reached a collaboration agreement with the Perry Group. Aliza and Alex are engaged to be married.”
“And Susannah?” Noah spat out, his voice laced with venom.
“Susannah has been staying at home for the past few days. She hasn’t gone outside, so our men… well, they had no reason to act.” Samuel lowered his head.
Noah fell into a heavy silence.
“Mr. Wall, perhaps it’s best if you return to the company for now,” Samuel urged once more. “The doctors and nurses here are very competent. Everything will be fine. Besides…” His voice dropped to a whisper as he added, “We’ve been keeping Mrs. Wall’s situation from Mrs. Stewart and Averi, but the boy keeps asking where his mother is. I’m afraid we may not be able to keep it a secret for much longer.”
Noah stiffened when he heard that.
He had been so consumed by Sadie’s condition that he had completely forgotten about her son.
“How is Averi?” Noah asked.
“He is doing well, but he misses his mother,” Samuel replied softly. “Every day, he comes up to me and asks when she will be back. At this point, I’m running out of excuses to give him.”
A flicker of guilt passed over Noah’s face. He owed Sadie so much.
He slowly got to his feet. “Let’s go.”
He took one last glance at Sadie before turning away and walking out of the hospital room.
Samuel followed quickly on his heels.
“Bring Averi over,” Noah suddenly said as they strode down the hallway.

“What?” Samuel was momentarily stunned, but soon understood Noah’s intention. “I understand, Mr. Wall.”
“Wait.” Noah stopped short. He looked like he wanted to say something but second-guessed himself at the last second. “Never mind. Let’s wait until she wakes up.”
Samuel stared at Noah’s back and sighed to himself. He knew that Noah was worried about Averi’s reaction if he saw his mother in such a state. They didn’t want to frighten the child.
Once back at Wall Group, Noah dove right in, handling the backlogs with his usual efficiency.
Just as Samuel had warned, several senior shareholders made their move during the next shareholders’ meeting. They criticized Noah for his absence and bluntly called for his removal from the position of CEO.
“Where have you been these past few days, Mr. Wall? The company is facing so many issues, yet you, the CEO, disappeared without a word. How can we entrust the future of this company to you?” This came from a senior shareholder with gray hair.
“He is right, Mr. Wall! Your actions have been highly irresponsible.”
“Indeed. We chose you to be the CEO because we have faith in your abilities. That doesn’t give you the right to just up and go as you please.”noveldrama
“I agree.”
Soon enough, the other shareholders chimed in with similar sentiments. They collectively attacked Noah and questioned his qualifications as CEO.
Noah sat silently at the head of the long table, his face blank as he listened to their accusations.
These geezers were simply trying to seize more power, and they all knew it.
“Are you done?” Noah finally spoke once the commotion started to die down. Although his tone was calm, it commanded the room with his distinct air of authority. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 516:
“If you’re done, then I suppose it’s my turn.” He swept his gaze over the room, his eyes like a scythe slashing over the fields. “As long as I keep the company afloat, I will do things my way. It is not for you to interfere with my affairs. If you have any ions, speak to my assistant, and I will buy out all your shares, once and for all.” With that, he slammed his palms against the table and stood. “Meeting adjourned!”
He walked out of the conference room without a backward glance, leaving the shareholders exchanging furious glances with each other.
“Are you all right, Mr. Wall?” Samuel asked with concern as he trailed after Noah.
“I’m fine.” Noah waved off his concern. “Look into the specifics of the Howe Group’s collaboration with the Perry Group.”
“Yes, sir,” Samuel replied immediately.
Noah returned to his office and began reviewing urgent documents.
The next morning. The hospital’s VIP ward.
“Mm…”
Sadie slowly opened her eyes, though her vision was slightly blurred, as if she was looking through a thin mist.
She blinked in an attempt to clear her vision, but her efforts had no effect.
“You’re awake?” a gentle voice asked beside her.noveldrama
Sadie turned in its direction and vaguely saw a figure in all white, likely a nurse, changing her dressing.
“Where… Where am I?” Sadie’s voice was hoarse and weak.
“I’m glad you’re awake, Mrs. Wall. You’re in the hospital,” the nurse said softly, her hands moving with practiced efficiency as she tended to Sadie.
Sadie fell silent.
L?t?st ch?pt?rs in g?lnovels.c?m
She tried to squint and open her eyes wide, but everything around her remained a blur. What was happening?
Panic set in immediately.
No matter how hard she tried, Sadie could only make out indistinct outlines of her surroundings.
“I… I can’t see anything…” she said, her voice trembling.
“Please stay calm. I’ll call the doctor.” The nurse quickly set down what she was holding and hurried out of the room.
A few moments later, the doctor rushed in, followed by several nurses.
The doctor conducted a thorough examination, carefully checking everything from Sadie’s pupil response to the interior of her eyes. He was meticulous, not overlooking even the smallest detail.
Once he finished, Sadie swallowed nervously and asked, “How is it, doctor?”
“Don’t worry, ma’am. It’s just a side effect of the trauma,” the doctor said calmly as he put away his equipment. “Your brain suffered a severe impact, which caused temporary damage to your optic nerve. It should recover on its own over time.”
“Really?” Sadie felt a wave of relief, but the worry still lingered. “How long will it take?”
“It varies from person to person. Some recover in a few days, while others may take months,” the doctor explained patiently. “The most important thing right now is for you to rest well and maintain a positive outlook. That will greatly aid your recovery.”
Sadie nodded, finally feeling a sense of ease. As long as she could recover, the time it took didn’t matter.
It was only then that she remembered something else. “How long have I been unconscious?”
“You’ve been in a coma for four days. Mr. Wall has been by your side the entire time. He just left a little while ago.” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 517:
“Noah?” Sadie’s heart skipped a beat, a mix of emotions rising in her chest.
Had he really stayed with her? Why? Was it out of guilt, or… something else? Sadie didn’t dare to think about it, afraid she might read into things that weren’t there.
“Doctor,” Sadie began, hesitating for a few seconds. “Would it be possible if you didn’t tell him I’ve woken up? Not yet, anyway.”
The doctor looked concerned. “I… understand, but why?”
“I just need some time to clear my head,” Sadie replied softly. “There are things I need to figure out on my own.”
“I see. I suppose it’s fine,” the doctor said, nodding in agreement.
Sadie breathed a quiet sigh of relief. Her biggest concern at the moment was the situation with the Howe family.
“Doctor, have you heard any news about the Howe family?” she asked tentatively.
“Well…” The doctor cocked his head to the side before shaking it. “I’m a doctor, not someone who keeps up with the financial world.”
Sadie felt disappointed by the response, but she knew she couldn’t blame him. “In that case, can I be discharged? I’d like to look into the current news myself.”
“I’m afraid that’s impossible, ma’am,” the doctor replied immediately. “Your current physical state absolutely forbids you from leaving the hospital. Like I said, your brain suffered severe damage trauma. You need complete rest, or there could be complications, and they could be very serious.”
“But—” Sadie began to protest, but the doctor raised a hand to stop her. “I will not budge on this,” he said firmly. “You need to stay in the hospital for further observation until your condition is completely stable.”
“All right,” Sadie replied with a resigned sigh. She had no choice but to accept staying in the hospital for now.
Then another thought crossed her mind. “In that case, may I see someone, doctor? I’d like to see my colleague, Nanette Barton.”
gα?ησν?s?c? brings imagination alive
The doctor paused, considering it for a moment. “Your colleague?”
“Yes,” Sadie nodded.
“I’ll need to get approval for that. Given your condition, you can’t meet with just anyone.”
“Thank you in advance, doctor,” Sadie said softly.
“You’re welcome,” the doctor replied with a smile before turning to leave the room.
The nurses followed him out, leaving Sadie alone.
She lay back in bed, staring at the ceiling as her thoughts raced. She had no idea what had been happening while she was unconscious.
How was the Howe family doing? What else had Noah done?
As the minutes dragged on, Sadie’s anxiety only grew.
How long would she have to wait to learn the truth?
Later, when the sky had darkened, the door to her room opened again, and a familiar figure entered.
“Sadie!” Nanette cried, her eyes welling with tears when she saw Sadie on the bed. “You finally woke up! You had me worried sick.”noveldrama
“Hello, Nanette.” Sadie mustered a smile, a surge of emotions rising in her chest. “Don’t cry. I’m all right now.”
Nanette hurried to Sadie’s bedside and took her hands, looking her over carefully, as if to ensure the medical staff hadn’t made her condition any worse. “You have no idea how worried I was!” Nanette said, her voice thick with emotion.
“I’m sorry for worrying you,” Sadie replied softly. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 518:noveldrama
Nanette shook her head and wiped away her tears. “All that matters is that you’re okay now.”
“Nanette…” Sadie paused, her voice steady but filled with concern. “Have you heard anything about the Howe family? How are they doing?”
Nanette’s expression grew grim. She hesitated for a moment, then chose to tell Sadie the truth.
“The Howe family has allied with the Perry family,” she said in a low voice. “They’ve struck a marriage agreement and are now teaming up against Wall Group.”
“What? Are you sure?”
Sadie bolted upright, a sharp jolt of pain shooting through the back of her head. She quickly brushed it off. None of that mattered now.
“And Noah? How is he—how is he handling this?”
Nanette reached out, steadying her with gentle hands. “Sadie, please, take it easy. You’re still recovering. The doctor insisted you rest.”
“I don’t care—I need to know!” Sadie shrugged off Nanette’s touch, her fists clenched. “Tell me, what happened next?” Her pulse raced, her breath uneven.
The Howe and Perry families—powerhouses in the business world—had formed an alliance.
But that wasn’t why she felt this gnawing unease. Wait. Was she actually… worried about Noah?
Nanette hesitated for only a moment before deciding to lay it all out, seeing the worry etched on Sadie’s face. “Sadie, don’t stress yourself. Mr. Wall is a master tactician. Even with the Howe and Perry families joining forces, his strategy ensured that Wall Group didn’t take a single loss. In the end… it was a stalemate. Neither side gained the upper hand.”
“A stalemate…” Sadie repeated the words under her breath, a flicker of relief easing the tightness in her chest. But something about that didn’t sit right.
Noah Wall—accepting a draw? No. That wasn’t his nature. He didn’t operate on equal terms with anyone.
Gal no ve l s . com hosts your favorite stories
He dictated the rules, controlled the board, and played the long game to win. Always.
Her brow furrowed as unease crept back in. “Nanette… are you absolutely sure about that?” She fixed her gaze on Nanette, searching for any trace of uncertainty.
Nanette shifted uncomfortably. “Well… I can’t say for sure. I don’t have direct access to Mr. Wall’s inner dealings…”
Taking a slow breath, Sadie shifted gears. “And the studio… the vandalism. Have the police found any leads?” Her voice was softer now.
Her fingers twisted the bed sheet unconsciously, her knuckles turning white. She barely noticed—too caught up in the storm of thoughts swirling in her mind. Even here, in a hospital bed, she couldn’t shut out the weight of work, the gnawing worry pressing against her chest.
Nanette watched her closely, concern evident in her sigh.
“Sadie, please… don’t stress yourself. This is in capable hands. Mr. Ford—Mr. Wall’s assistant—has been handling it from the start. If the police uncover anything, Mr. Ford will be the first to follow up.”
“Samuel…” Sadie uttered the name, her brows knitting together in thought. Samuel was Noah’s most trusted confidant—sharp, efficient, and unwaveringly loyal.
If he was on top of things, then surely, nothing could spiral out of control… right? Nanette’s voice softened. “Sadie, please. Just focus on getting better. That’s what matters most right now.”
Sadie murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, her gaze distant. She knew Nanette was only trying to comfort her, but her mind wouldn’t settle. Thoughts of Noah spun endlessly in her head, refusing to be ignored.

###Chapter 519:
Nanette’s voice cut through the silence. “Sadie, is there anything you’d like to eat? I can bring you something tomorrow.”
Sadie blinked, forcing a smile. “I don’t really have an appetite. Don’t trouble yourself.”
How could she think about food when all she could think about was Noah? Then, like a switch flipping, something inside her snapped. “NO. I can’t just sit here and do nothing.”
Her eyes were sharp with sudden resolve. Without another thought, she flung off the covers and swung her legs over the side of the bed.
“Sadie! What are you doing?” Nanette’s startled voice rang out as she lunged forward to stop her.
“I’m getting out of here.” Sadie’s voice was steady, unyielding. “I can’t just lie here waiting—I need to find out what’s really going on.”
Nanette’s face paled. “But your health—Sadie, you’re still recovering!” Her voice wavered, thick with worry, her eyes glassy with unshed tears.
“I’m fine.” Sadie pushed Nanette’s hand away, her voice firm, unwavering.
“Nanette, don’t try to stop me. I have to go.”
Her body was weak, every movement a battle against her own frailty, but she forced herself upright, her steps unsteady but determined.
“Sadie! Stop!” Nanette’s voice cracked, thick with tears and frustration. She knew Sadie too well—once her mind was set, there was no changing it. Stubborn didn’t even begin to describe her.
Sadie didn’t acknowledge the desperation in Nanette’s tone. She just kept moving.
Reaching the wardrobe, she yanked it open, rifling through her clothes with single-minded determination. Every motion, though slightly shaky, was deliberate.
Nanette could only watch, worried, her heart sinking as Sadie braced herself to walk out into whatever storm awaited her.

“Doctor! Doctor! Please, stop her! She’s trying to leave the hospital!” Nanette’s panicked cry rang through the corridor, her voice trembling as tears welled in her eyes.
Within moments, the doctor rushed in, only to find Sadie already dressed, her determination as clear as day. His expression darkened with concern. “Miss Hudson, you’re in no condition to be discharged. If you leave now, you’ll risk serious complications.”
Sadie met his gaze, unwavering. “Doctor, I understand my condition perfectly. But I have something far more important to do.”
The doctor opened his mouth to protest, but was cut off.
“Don’t waste your breath, Doctor.” Sadie’s tone was final, cutting through the room like a blade. “My decision is made. Nothing will change it.”
“Sadie, you really are something.” A low, cold voice sliced through the air like a sudden gust of winter wind. Sadie’s breath caught. The certainty in her chest wavered, her entire body freezing mid-step.
Slowly, she turned. Noah stood at the doorway, tall, imposing, his broad shoulders framed by the crisp lines of his impeccably tailored black suit. Every inch of him radiated quiet authority.
But his eyes… Those deep, penetrating eyes locked onto her with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine.
Without breaking his gaze, he stepped forward.
“Noah?” Sadie’s voice wavered, barely above a whisper. She hadn’t expected to see him. Not here. Not now.noveldrama
Her mind scrambled for words—an explanation, anything—but nothing came.
“Everyone. Out.” Noah’s voice was ice—cold, commanding, absolute.
His gaze was unreadable, his presence suffocating, heavy as a storm about to break.

###Chapter 520:
The doctor and Nanette exchanged uneasy glances, a flicker of fear passing between them.
Defying Noah was not an option. Silently, they obeyed, slipping out of the room, the door clicking shut behind them.
The sound echoed in the vast stillness. Sadie’s heart clenched.
Now, it was just the two of them.
The air in the room thickened, charged with intensity as Noah took a slow, deliberate step forward. Then another. And another.
“Sadie, are you really so desperate to leave me?” His deep voice shattered the silence.
“That’s not…” She wanted to deny it, to explain—but the words barely left her lips before Noah cut her off. “That’s not what you were doing? Then, what the hell were you doing? Come on, tell me!” Noah pointed at Sadie’s outfit, his tone stern and angry.
“Do you even understand the state you’re in? Your head wound hasn’t healed, and yet you’re trying to walk out of here? What are you trying to do—kill yourself?”
Sadie flinched, momentarily stunned by the sheer force of his anger. She parted her lips, but no words came out.
“Lie down. Now.” Before she could react, Noah’s hands were on her shoulders, pushing her back onto the bed.
“Hey—” A sharp gasp escaped her as pain flared at the back of her head.
Her body tensed, her vision momentarily blurring.
Noah’s jaw tightened. The moment he saw her wince, saw the color drain from her face, something shifted in his expression. His anger wavered, a flicker of regret surfacing in his dark eyes. He’d been too harsh. Too forceful.
For a brief second, his fingers hovered as if he wanted to check on her, to see if she was okay. But then the memory of her reckless attempt to leave reignited the fire in his chest.

Clenching his jaw, he forced himself to rein in his frustration. His tone, though still firm, softened—just slightly. “Sadie, listen to me. You’re not going anywhere.
You will stay in this bed and recover. Understood?”
Sadie opened her mouth, but before she could get another word out—
“Enough!” Noah cut her off.
“Not another word. You don’t need to explain anything. You don’t need to do anything. Just stay put and rest.”
His tone, though less harsh than before, carried finality.
Sadie stared at Noah’s stern face, frustration and grievance swelling in her chest.
“Can you at least hear me out, Noah? What exactly happened between Wall Group and the Howe Group?”noveldrama
She locked eyes with him, searching for answers, determined to uncover the truth.
Noah exhaled sharply, irritation flickering across his features.
He didn’t want her involved in this—didn’t want her anywhere near the chaos brewing beneath the surface.
But he knew Sadie. If he kept her in the dark, she wouldn’t stop until she uncovered everything herself. And that… that was far too dangerous.
Better she heard it from him than risk her life chasing after it.
“The Howe Group…” His words were deliberate. “They got exactly what they deserved.”
He didn’t elaborate. He didn’t soften the blow. He simply delivered the truth in a voice devoid of sympathy.
“Deserved?” Sadie echoed his word, eyes widening.
She had known the Howe and Perry families had joined forces against Wall Group, but still—hearing what Noah said sent a chill down her spine.

Message from Noah:
Hello, dear readers! Sorry for the delay this week — my birthday was two days ago, and I didn’t have much time to release the chapters.
Two new novels will be released tomorrow. I hope you enjoy them!
God loves you, and Noah wishes you all the best. (?O?=)? ?

###Chapter 521:
Her fingers curled into fists at her sides. “Noah… have you misunderstood something?”
Sadie’s voice trembled slightly, and disbelief clouded her expression. “You must have misunderstood, Alex.”
“Misunderstood?” Noah’s sneer cut through the air. “Sadie, don’t be so naive. Do you actually think Alex is decent? He’s a businessman, driven purely by family interests. To achieve his goals, he’ll stop at nothing, regardless of the consequences.”
Noah’s harsh words struck Sadie like a series of blows, wounding her. “No… That can’t be…” she murmured, her tears now uncontrollable, streaming down her face.
Noah’s expression hardened. He grasped Sadie’s chin, forcing her eyes to meet his.
“Listen, Sadie. You’re to stay in this hospital and avoid causing any trouble! Step out of line again, and you can say goodbye to your studio.”
His threat widened Sadie’s eyes with shock.
“What… What are you saying, Noah?”
“My point is clear.” Noah’s look was icy as he spoke.
He then turned and left the room without a second glance.
“Noah, wait!” Sadie attempted to rise from her bed, but a sharp pain from her head wound made her gasp and fall back.
Powerless, she watched Noah walk out of the room.
“Noah… You bastard!” Sadie collapsed back onto the bed, her tears unabated. She understood Noah’s serious tone; defying him would mean the end of her studio.
Her studio was her passion, her life’s work—she couldn’t afford to lose it.
Noah exited the hospital room, the door slamming behind him.

In the corridor, he took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, trying to quell the rising irritation and anger inside him. He acknowledged his loss of control. He shouldn’t have attacked Sadie verbally or made such harsh threats.
But his emotions had gotten the better of him.
He couldn’t bear to see Sadie constantly endangering herself or maintaining secrets and distance.
The Howe family had hurt his woman, and he wasn’t about to let them off the hook easily. No way!
He turned to Nanette, who stood nearby with her head bowed, clearly avoiding his gaze.
“Mr. Wall…” Nanette’s voice quivered.
Noah remained silent, gesturing for her to go on.noveldrama
“Sadie… She insisted on being discharged early, and we… we couldn’t stop her,” Nanette stammered, her fear of Noah’s reaction palpable.
“I understand,” Noah replied, his tone even and emotionless.
He walked to the corridor window, lit a cigarette, and took a deep drag. The nicotine soothed his nerves and helped clear his mind.
Staring into the night sky, he seemed lost in thought.
Soon, a doctor in a white coat approached, holding a medical record.
“Excuse me, Mr. Wall,” the doctor said with respect.
Noah faced him and inquired, “How is she?”
The doctor opened the medical record. “Mrs. Wall has awakened and is past the critical phase. She needs rest, but… but…”
“But what?” Noah interjected, his brow creasing.
“Her emotional state is very unstable, which hinders her recovery. She’s also experiencing temporary blurred vision, though it should resolve on its own,” the doctor explained earnestly. “Since waking, she’s been inquiring about Wall Group and the Howe family. We… we haven’t disclosed anything…” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 522:
Noah nodded, signaling his comprehension. “Ensure she receives excellent care and update me immediately with any changes.”
“Of course, Mr. Wall,” the doctor affirmed and then departed.
Noah finished his cigarette and disposed of it in the trash.
He turned to Nanette with a stern expression. “Stay here and watch over her. She is not to leave the hospital without my permission. Understood?”
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” Nanette replied promptly.noveldrama
With nothing more to say, Noah exited the hospital.
He slid into his car, ignited the engine, and sped away.
At the hospital entrance, a black car lingered quietly.
The window rolled down slowly, unveiling a face both exquisite and cold. Aliza watched Noah’s car vanish into the darkness, her lips twisting into a sneer.
“The hospital is now under the watch of Noah’s bodyguards, so it looks like there’s no chance to take another shot at Sadie for the time being… Lucky her.” Aliza scoffed softly, clearly displeased with the situation.
“Drive to Willowbranch Villa,” she commanded the driver, her tone icy and determined.
“Right away, Miss Perry,” the driver responded, firing up the engine and pulling away from the hospital.
Nestled at the foot of a mountain on the city’s outskirts, Willowbranch Villa was Alex’s private sanctuary. The property was ensconced in lush greenery, providing a tranquil setting.
Aliza’s intent in visiting was clear: she needed to see Alex.
Following a significant rift with his father, Terrance, over Sadie, Alex had retreated here, isolating himself from everyone.
gα?ησν?s?com, the place for amazing tales
Aliza was aware of Alex’s deep feelings for Sadie, which she found intolerable. She could not accept Alex forsaking their families’ planned marriage alliance for Sadie, nor his apparent betrayal.
Determined to sway Alex back to her side, Aliza arrived at the gates of Willowbranch Villa and stepped out of the car.
The security guards, recognizing her, swiftly opened the gates.
“Good to see you again, Miss Perry,” one guard greeted with respect.
Aliza nodded silently and continued inside. In the villa, Alex was found in the living room, seated on the sofa with a glass of red wine in hand, deep in contemplation.
Hearing footsteps, Alex looked up to see Aliza entering. His expression tightened.
“Why are you here?” His tone was cool.
Aliza approached and sat down on the sofa across from him, her smile charming yet calculated.
“What’s wrong, Alex? Aren’t you pleased to see me?” she teased.
Alex remained silent, focusing instead on his wine.
“Alex, must things really come to this?” Aliza’s voice softened. “I understand you’re upset, but you can’t discard what we have over Sadie.”
“What we have?” Alex scoffed. “What do we really have, Aliza? We’re just pieces in our families’ schemes.”
“How can you say that?” Aliza’s smile faded, her tone turning sharp. “You know my feelings for you.”
“I know,” Alex acknowledged. “But my feelings aren’t the same.”
“You…” Aliza was momentarily speechless, her complexion paling.
“Alex, remember our families’ expectations for this marriage. Aren’t you concerned about defying your father with such behavior?” she pressed, attempting to sway Alex with the weight of family obligations. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 523:
“My father?” Alex’s laugh was bitter. “He’s only interested in our family’s gains. Since when has he considered my feelings?”
Aliza trembled with anger. “Alex, you’ll regret this!”
“Regret?” Alex shook his head dismissively. “My only regret is ever meeting you.” He finished his wine in one gulp and left the room.
Aliza stared after him, her eyes seething with fury and defiance.
“Alex, you won’t get your way. And Sadie, she won’t escape my wrath either,” she hissed, her voice laced with venom.
Meanwhile, Sadie lay restless in her hospital bed, her mind tormented. Noah’s words pierced her like thorns, leaving her feeling trapped and breathless.
The next morning, sunlight filtered through the gaps in the curtains, bathing Sadie’s pale face in a gentle glow.
Her eyelids fluttered open, yet her vision stayed blurred.
“Miss Hudson, you’re awake?” A nurse walked into the room, her tone laced with concern.
“How are you feeling? Any discomfort?”
“My eyesight seems to be getting worse…” Sadie’s voice quavered.
The nurse’s expression shifted to alarm. “Don’t worry, Miss Hudson. I’ll call the doctor immediately.”
Shortly after, an ophthalmologist arrived to examine Sadie.
After a thorough examination and a few questions, the ophthalmologist offered a reassuring conclusion.
“Miss Hudson, try not to worry. Your condition is reversible. I’ll prescribe some medication. Follow the directions, rest well, and stay positive. Your vision should improve gradually.”
Relieved, Sadie nodded.
Step into a new journey on .con
The doctor offered some advice and then exited the room.
The nurse handed Sadie a glass of warm water to help her take her medication. “Miss Hudson, please rest. If you need anything at all, just let me know,” the nurse advised warmly.
“Thank you,” Sadie murmured.
Once alone, Sadie lay back, but sleep eluded her.
Her mind churned with thoughts, tangled and jumbled, keeping her from finding peace.
“Noah… What do you really want from me?” she whispered, her voice laden with emotion.
Outside her door, the muted tones of a conversation caught her attention. Sadie strained to listen, her blurred vision making out two nurses at the doorway, murmuring to each other.
“I heard Mr. Wall is deeply concerned about Miss Hudson…”
“Yes, he even brought in a top ophthalmologist from abroad. Not just anyone gets that kind of treatment…”
“Hey, what do you think about Miss Hudson’s background? To have Mr. Wall so devoted…”
“Who knows? But judging by Mr. Wall’s actions, she must be special to him…”
“That makes sense…”noveldrama
The quiet conversation of the nurses reached Sadie’s ears.
A wave of bitterness washed over her.
Did Noah truly care about her?
Possibly. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 524:
Yet, how enduring could his concern be?
Sadie smiled ruefully at herself, her mood darkening.
She would prefer Noah’s indifference over this superficial concern.noveldrama
Such care only intensified her pain and confusion.
Meanwhile, in a lavish villa on the city’s outskirts, Alex slowly awoke. He rubbed his eyes, groggy, his head throbbing.
The night before, he had drowned his sorrows in alcohol, hoping to numb the pain and escape his problems.
However, the effects of the alcohol had worn off, and reality was waiting for him as he awoke.
He rose from bed, walked to the window, and pulled open the curtains.
Bright sunlight flooded the room, momentarily blinding him.
Squinting, he looked out at the familiar landscape, feeling utterly lost. Uncertain of his next steps, he pondered how to face Sadie, handle the pressure from Aliza, and navigate the demands of his family.
“Ring. Ring. Ring…” His phone’s sudden ring jolted him from his thoughts. Alex picked it up and saw it was his assistant, Stan Cabot. After hesitating for a moment, he answered. “Hello?”
“Mr. Howe, you finally answered!” Stan’s voice was laced with concern. “Where have you been these past few days? I’ve been calling repeatedly, worried sick.”
“I…” Alex’s voice was rough.
“I’m fine, Stan. Just needed some time alone.”
“Mr. Howe, I’m glad you’re okay,” Stan replied, his voice heavy with relief. “But if you don’t return soon, there’s going to be significant trouble at Howe Group.”
“What happened?” Alex’s brow furrowed.
Dive into fiction with gα?ησν?s．com
“Miss Aliza Perry has been appointed as the general manager of Howe Group,” Stan replied. “Now, the Perry and Howe families are joining forces, preparing to take on Wall Group together.”
“What?” Alex was shocked. “How is this possible? Why would my father agree to this?”
“Your father was compelled by the circumstances,” Stan explained, his voice heavy. “The Perry family is now fully cooperating with Howe Group.”
Alex was silent for a moment.
He knew Stan was telling the truth.
Ever since his disagreement with Terrance, Terrance had been utterly disappointed in him.
Terrance’s decision to form an alliance with the Perry family for the sake of their family interests was predictable.
However, Alex hadn’t expected things to escalate so quickly.
“What are you planning to do now?” Stan inquired. “Do you want to come back and see for yourself?”
After a brief hesitation, Alex responded, “Alright. I’ll return immediately.” Ending the call, Alex felt the weight of his decision.
He quickly freshened up, changed into clean clothes, and left his villa.
Shortly thereafter, he drove directly to Howe Group headquarters.
His mind was burdened, haunted by thoughts of Sadie.
In the general manager’s office at Howe Group headquarters, Aliza sat behind her desk, stirring her coffee with a slight, triumphant smile.
Since being appointed as the general manager, she had been tightening her grip on the company.

###Chapter 525:
She had rallied a group of loyal employees around her while marginalizing her detractors.
Now, she had firmly taken control at Howe Group, becoming its de facto leader.
“Knock, knock, knock.” The sudden sound interrupted Aliza’s thoughts.
“Come in,” she said calmly.
The door opened, and an employee entered.
“Miss Perry, here’s the coffee you requested,” said the employee respectfully.
“Thank you; just leave it there,” Aliza directed him.
After the employee placed the coffee on the desk and left, Aliza took a sip, smiling in satisfaction.
She savored the feeling of complete control, relishing her newfound authority. She felt a surge of pride, finally shedding the label of “Mr. Howe’s secretary” to embrace her true role as a leading figure in the company.
She even allowed herself to daydream about someday being known as “Mrs. Howe.”
“Good morning, everyone.” Aliza stood up and addressed the employees outside her office. “I’ve brought coffee for everyone today. I hope you all enjoy it.”
Her announcement was met with a burst of enthusiastic applause from the staff.
“Thank you, Miss Perry!”
“Miss Perry, you’re amazing!”
“Thank you so much, Miss Perry.”
“I don’t know how to express my gratitude…”
The employees shared their thanks, their faces glowing with excitement and appreciation.

They were surprised to learn that the former secretary to Mr. Howe was actually a member of the Perry family and likely the future wife of Howe Group’s CEO.
“You’re welcome. Thank you all for your hard work,” Aliza responded with a smile. “From now on, we’re one family. I hope we can all work together to make Howe Group even better.”
“We will!” the employees replied in unison, their voices strong and spirited.
Aliza nodded, pleased with their reaction.
She felt confident that she had gained the employees’ support.
“Miss Perry, you’re incredible!” an employee exclaimed. “You’ve transformed the company atmosphere since your arrival. I admire you so much.”
“Exactly, Miss Perry, you’re our role model!” another added.
“I agree…”
Amid the praise, Aliza offered a subtle smile, choosing to remain silent. Suddenly, the office door burst open.
Alex entered with a stern look.
“Alex? What… Why are you here?” Aliza’s smile faltered, a flicker of panic in her eyes.
She hadn’t anticipated Alex’s sudden appearance.
“Good morning, Mr. Howe.”noveldrama
“Hello, Mr. Howe.”
The employees greeted Alex with surprise and confusion.
“What are you doing here, Aliza?” Alex’s tone was icy and charged with anger.
Aliza faltered under Alex’s intense gaze, stammering, “I’m here for work, of course…”
“For work?” Alex said with a sneer.
Words failed Aliza as Alex’s derision washed over her, her complexion turning from pale to flushed.

###Chapter 526:
“Alex, remember, I am now the general manager of Howe Group.”
“General manager?” Alex’s sneer deepened. “You know exactly how you landed that position!”
“You…” Anger made Aliza’s voice quiver. “Don’t push me too far, Alex!”
“Aliza, I’m here to inform you that as of today, you are no longer the general manager of Howe Group.”
“You…” Aliza’s expression shifted drastically at Alex’s declaration.
“You can’t do this to me, Alex! You have no right to treat me this way!”
“Enough!” Alex shouted. “Leave now! From this moment, I never want to see you again.”
“You asked her to leave? Where should she go?” Terrance’s voice boomed through the corridor like a clap of thunder. He approached with long, determined strides.
Even in his advanced years, his tall and commanding presence still reflected the handsome, upright man he once was.
Time had etched its marks on his face, yet his enduring authority rendered him naturally imposing.
His piercing gaze swept the room, finally landing on Alex with undisguised anger.noveldrama
“Come here, Alex,” Terrance commanded, pointing towards the chair in the office nearby. “You too, Aliza.”
Aliza followed without hesitation, her demeanor subdued. As she passed Alex, she turned slightly, offering him a look filled with mixed emotions, as though she wanted to speak but restrained herself.
Alex felt a sinking feeling.
It was rare for Terrance to address him with such severity, especially in front of the employees.
Fresh chapters live g?lnσνe?s?c?m
It seemed this issue might not be resolved easily.
Taking a deep breath to quell his frustration, Alex followed them.
The chairman’s office at Howe Group was spacious and opulently furnished.
Terrance sat behind a large desk, his expression stormy.
His hands were clasped on the desk, his knuckles whitening with tension.
Alex stood firmly, meeting his father’s gaze with unwavering determination. Aliza stood slightly to the side, her head bowed, projecting an image of obedience and calm, her thoughts unreadable.
“Explain yourself. What are you attempting to do?” Terrance’s voice was low and controlled.
“Dad, I’m only trying to do what’s best for the company,” Alex replied, his voice calm yet assertive. “The issues with Wall Group’s maritime trade project were our fault, leading to delays and a breach of contract. We should proactively reach out to Wall Group to negotiate and find a solution, instead of escalating conflicts that could lead to mutual ruin.”
“Negotiate? Find a solution?” Terrance scoffed, his eyes brimming with disdain. “Do you think Noah is some kind of saint who will easily forgive us? You’re too naive.”
“Dad, in business, there are no eternal enemies, only interests that never die. Wall Group may be powerful, but they are not unbeatable. As long as we…”
“Enough!” Terrance slammed the desk, cutting Alex off. “Quiet! You know nothing. You think you understand the business world better than I do? Ridiculous!”
“Dad, I…” Alex began to counter, but the sharpness in Terrance’s gaze silenced him.
“Aliza has conducted an investigation. She uncovered the true cause.” Terrance’s tone softened but retained its firm authority. “The issues with the maritime trade weren’t accidental. Noah orchestrated it. They set us up to force us into a corner, aiming to take over Howe Group.”

###Chapter 527:noveldrama
Alex, stunned, turned to Aliza. “Is this true?”
Aliza looked up, her eyes steady, her voice resolute. “Alex, I wouldn’t deceive you. All the evidence I’ve gathered points directly to Noah; he’s been manipulating everything from behind the scenes.”
“But…”
Alex struggled with the revelation. He knew Noah to be ruthless, yet he had always conducted himself with integrity. How could he be involved in such deceit?
They had grown up together, and he thought he understood his old friend.
“No buts!” Terrance interjected firmly. “Alex, this is not the time for rash decisions. Howe Group and Wall Group are at a point where it’s either us or them. You need to cooperate with Aliza, confront the Wall Group, and safeguard Howe Group.”
Alex remained silent.
He understood his father’s resolve; once Terrance made up his mind, it was nearly impossible to sway him.
The evidence Aliza presented also made him reconsider his perspective on Noah.
“I understand, Dad.” Alex’s voice was low, slightly rough. “I’ll give it my all.”
“You must prevail!” Terrance’s voice hardened. “Alex, you’re my son. You cannot afford to lose, especially not to Noah.”
Alex responded only by tightening his fists.
“Also,” Terrance said, his voice softening, “be kinder to Aliza. She has been instrumental to you and Howe Group. Don’t disappoint her.”
Aliza trembled slightly at these words. She looked at Alex, her eyes conveying both hope and a trace of grievance.
Alex glanced at her, a wave of irritation washing over him.
He was aware of her feelings for him and everything she had done on his behalf, yet he couldn’t shake his feelings for Sadie.

“Dad,” Alex began, attempting to clarify, but Aliza cut him off.
“Mr. Howe, please,” she said, shaking her head, “Alex is simply overwhelmed with work. It’s alright.”
Aliza’s voice quivered with suppressed emotion, casting her in a particularly sympathetic light.
Terrance regarded her, a fleeting trace of sympathy appearing in his eyes. “Aliza, you’re a good girl. Don’t worry. As long as I’m here, I won’t let Alex mistreat you.”
“Thank you, Howe.” Aliza bowed her head, the corners of her lips twitching into a faint smile.
“Alright, Aliza. You may leave now. I need to speak with Alex,” Terrance said.
“Okay,” Aliza replied meekly and turned to leave the office.
As she closed the door behind her, the faint smile disappeared, replaced by a steely expression.
Inside the office, Terrance turned his cold gaze on Alex.
“Alex, are you still thinking about that woman?” he asked sharply.
Alex tensed; he knew his father was referring to Sadie. “Dad, I…”
“I’m warning you, Alex!” Terrance’s voice rose sharply. “If you get involved with that woman again, if you hurt Aliza, I assure you that woman and her child will find themselves in a dire situation.”
Terrance’s words pierced Alex like icy blades.
Alex stared at his father in disbelief. “Dad, how can you say such a thing?”
“Why shouldn’t I?” Terrance retorted coldly. “Who does she think she is? What makes her worthy of you?” 
.

###Chapter 528:
“Dad! Sadie isn’t…”
“Enough!” Terrance cut him off. “I don’t want to hear another word in her defense. You’re my son. I will dictate your future, and it involves marrying Aliza. She is the only one suitable for you, the right choice to be my daughter-in-law.”
“Dad…” Alex tried to protest, but it was clear Terrance was no longer listening.
“Enough. You may go now.” Terrance dismissed him wearily. “Remember my words; don’t disappoint me again.”
Alex looked at his father, a mixture of pain and resignation in his eyes.
He knew arguing was futile.
For Sadie’s safety, he would have to bide his time.
“I understand, Dad,” Alex said, his voice rough with emotion. “I promise you.”
At Alex’s acquiescence, Terrance’s tense features softened slightly. He closed his eyes and massaged his temples, visibly aged by the confrontation.
Silently, Alex left the office, closing the door gently behind him.
The hallway was deserted except for the echoing click of Aliza’s high heels against the floor.
She walked to a secluded corner, pulled out her phone, and dialed a familiar number.
The call was swiftly answered, and a middle-aged man’s deep, authoritative voice filled her ear. “Hello, Aliza.”
“Hello, Dad.” Aliza’s tone was suddenly sweet and compliant, a stark contrast to the restraint she had shown in front of Terrance. “It’s done.”
“Really?” Her father’s voice carried a hint of excitement. “Did the Howe family fall for it?”
“Yes, they did.” Aliza’s lips twisted into a smug smile. “I presented the fabricated evidence as you instructed, and both Alex and his father believed Noah was behind everything.”

“Ha ha ha…” Elbert Perry, Aliza’s father, laughed heartily, his voice brimming with satisfaction. “Excellent! Aliza, you’ve done well.” A gleam of cunning flashed in Aliza’s eyes.
Her father had always held a grudge against Noah.
Noah, a renowned figure in the business world, had elevated Wall Group to a commercial titan at a young age, outshining competitors.
Meanwhile, despite its prominence, Perry Group always lagged behind Wall Group.
Elbert had long aspired to outdo Noah and seize control of Wall Group but lacked the means to do so.
“Dad, haven’t you always wanted to bring down Noah?” Aliza asked, her voice soft. “Now, the chance is ours.”
“Ha ha ha…” Elbert’s laughter echoed again. “Aliza, rest assured. Together, we will topple Noah and claim Wall Group for ourselves.”
“I believe it, Dad.” Aliza nodded vigorously. “We will succeed.” Her smile widened as she ended the call.
Meanwhile, Alex felt like a marionette, his steps heavy as he trudged back to his office.
His father’s menacing words rang in his ears, Aliza’s smug expression haunted him, and the image of Sadie kept surfacing in his mind, stabbing his heart with relentless pain.
Alex pondered what he should do.
How could he ensure Sadie’s safety?
Was he really prepared to give up the woman he loved for his family’s interests?
He doubted he could go through with it.
Yet, what power did he have to defy his father’s commands and withstand the entire family’s pressure?

###Chapter 529:
“Knock, knock, knock.”
Loud knocks jolted Alex from his reverie.
He looked up, his voice weary and strained. “Come in!”
The door burst open, and Stan entered, his expression marked by urgency, panting for breath.
“Mr. Howe! Bad news!”
A heavy sense of dread sank in Alex’s chest.
He steeled himself against his rising anxiety and asked with a grave tone, “What’s happened? Why are you so agitated?”
“Mrs. Howe… Mrs. Howe has…” Stan said, his voice tinged with panic, “Mrs. Howe has gone missing.”
“What?” Alex leaped to his feet, his complexion blanching.
He seized Stan’s arm, his voice trembling with urgency. “What did you say? My mother is missing? When did this occur?”
“Just… just moments ago,” Stan replied, visibly shaken by Alex’s intensity. “I got a call from your family’s butler. He said Mrs. Howe went out this afternoon and hasn’t returned. Her phone is off, and though people have been sent to search, there’s still no word…”
Alex’s world seemed to spin, his vision blurring as he struggled to maintain composure.
His mother was a cornerstone of his life; he couldn’t bear the thought of losing her.
“Find her!” Alex growled through clenched teeth. “Find out where my mother went at once! Spare no expense to ensure her safe return.”
“Understood, Mr. Howe. I’m on it immediately.” Stan nodded, wasting no time as he turned and hurried out.noveldrama
Alex slumped back into his chair, his hands clenched into fists, nails digging into his palms. Blood seeped from the wounds, unnoticed.

The disappearance of his mother was surely no accident.
At such a critical time, her sudden absence might suggest she had been kidnapped.
Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office of Wall Group, Noah was engrossed in a pile of documents, his brows furrowed in concentration.
“Ring, ring, ring…”
An urgent phone call broke his focus.
Noah glanced at the caller ID and saw it was Samuel.
He answered, his voice low. “Hello, Samuel. What’s going on?”
“Mr. Wall, it’s done,” Samuel replied, his tone laced with a hint of pride.
“Hmm,” Noah responded, his voice neutral, betraying no surprise.
“Mr. Wall, what are our next steps?” Samuel inquired cautiously.
A cold flash passed through Noah’s eyes, his tone icy and firm. “I want everyone who harmed Sadie to face consequences, one by one.” This included Susannah.
Noah’s long fingers tapped rhythmically on the desk.
Samuel, having worked for Noah for many years, was intimately familiar with his character and style.
Noah was decisive and swift in his actions; once he made a decision, it was final.
Above all, Noah’s deep concern for Sadie was a driving force behind his actions.
For Sadie, Noah would go to any length.
Samuel knew that those who had harmed Sadie were in for serious repercussions this time.

###Chapter 530:
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded with respect.
Noah said nothing further and abruptly ended the call.
As dusk settled and the city lights cast a warm glow, Myrtlewood Estate was enveloped in a cozy yellow light, creating a tranquil atmosphere throughout.
Returning home exhausted, Noah draped his coat over the sofa and loosened his tie, attempting to alleviate the day’s tension.
He had spent the day resolving a conflict with Howe Group at the office and clandestinely planning against those who had hurt Sadie, leaving him both physically and emotionally spent.
Yet, thoughts of Sadie softened his expression.
She constantly filled his thoughts and tugged at his heartstrings.
“Tap… Tap… Tap…” The sound of light footsteps broke through Noah’s reverie. Looking up, he saw Averi running out of the playroom, his arms brimming with colorful building blocks.noveldrama
“Mr. Wall!” Averi’s voice was soft and innocent, a melody to Noah’s ears.
He scampered to Noah’s side, looking up with wide, eager eyes. “You’re back, Mr. Wall!”
Noah’s heart melted immediately. He crouched down, lifted Averi into his arms, and affectionately nuzzled his cheek.
“Yes, I’m back,” Noah replied, his voice deep and soothing, with a touch of fondness.
Averi nestled into Noah’s embrace, finding a snug spot, and resumed his play with the building blocks.
He carefully placed a red block atop a blue one, then added a yellow block on top, murmuring to himself, “A house. A tall house…”
Observing Averi’s earnest expression, Noah couldn’t help but smile.
Your favorite tales live at g?lnσν?s．
He found the little boy utterly charming.
He reached out and gently patted Averi’s head, savoring the softness of his hair.
Suddenly, Averi paused, looked up with wide eyes, and asked innocently, “Mr. Wall, where’s Mommy?”
Noah’s smile faltered, and his heart sank.
He was at a loss for words.
How should he explain?
How could he tell Averi about his mother’s condition?
His throat tightened, and he struggled to find the right words.
Looking into Averi’s trusting eyes, Noah felt a sharp pang of guilt.
“Mr. Wall?” Averi’s soft voice broke through the silence, filled with confusion. Noah snapped back to the present, pushing down his emotions to maintain a calm appearance.
He tousled Averi’s hair affectionately, his voice melting into a tender whisper.
“Mommy… Mommy is on a business trip.”
He paused, then said, “She’s gone to a place far away and will be back after a little while.”
“A business trip?” Averi tilted his head, puzzled by the term.
“When will Mommy come back?” he asked, his voice laden with hope.
“Very soon,” Noah reassured him, striving to sound upbeat. “She told me she would bring you lots of gifts.” Noah spoke, aiming to keep his voice light and cheerful to prevent Averi from sensing anything was wrong.
“Really?” Averi’s eyes sparkled with excitement, and he clapped his hands joyfully. “That’s great! Mommy’s going to bring me gifts. I have to tell Ewing; he’ll be so jealous.”

###Chapter 531:
Ewing Racey was Averi’s best friend from kindergarten.
Watching Averi’s elated face, Noah felt a swirl of emotions wash over him.
“Mr. Wall?” Averi tugged gently at Noah’s sleeve, noticing his silence. “What’s wrong? Are you okay?”
Noah snapped back to reality, masking his sadness with a smile. “I’m fine, Averi. I was just thinking about what gifts your mommy might bring you.”
He shifted the conversation, hoping to distract Averi.
“What could they be?” Averi’s curiosity was piqued.
He tilted his head as he speculated. “Maybe a red toy car, like a fire truck? I want one!”
“That’s possible,” Noah replied, his voice slightly hoarse.
“And a Transformer? I want Optimus Prime!”
Averi’s excitement mounted, his cheeks glowing with enthusiasm. “That’s possible too,” Noah murmured, his voice softening, unable to meet Averi’s eager eyes.
“And…”
“Averi,” Noah interjected, his voice steady. “Your mom’s business trip might take a while. Why don’t you head to bed, okay? When she gets back, I’ll make sure she tells you a bedtime story. Alright?” He was aware he was misleading Averi, but it felt necessary.
He wanted to shield Averi from worry and the harsher truths.
“Fine…” Averi nodded, somewhat disappointed. “Alright. I’ll go to sleep now. Good night, Mr. Wall.”
With that, he hopped off Noah’s lap, his building blocks in hand, casting longing glances back as he walked to his bedroom.
Noah watched Averi’s small figure vanish through the door, his heart heavy with sorrow.
Endless adventures await on gα?ησν?s?comnoveldrama
The first rays of morning light filtered through the curtains, illuminating Alex’s handsome yet weary face.
He rubbed his eyes, haunted by thoughts of his mother’s disappearance.
Getting out of bed, he walked to the window and flung the curtains open.
The bright sunlight made him squint, but his mind was too fraught with anxiety to mind.
Alex quickly freshened up, dressed sharply, and headed to his study. He powered up his computer and pulled up the surveillance footage from the previous night.
On the screen, Susannah appeared at the entrance of their villa.
She paced anxiously, waiting for something.
Suddenly, a black car pulled up. The door opened, and several men in black dragged Susannah inside.
She struggled and shouted, but it was futile.
The car sped away into the night.
Alex watched the screen, fists clenched, anger and worry making his face pale, his teeth grinding.
“Mom…” he whispered, his voice trembling.
He scrutinized the footage repeatedly, searching for additional clues.
When he noticed the license plate of the black car, his pupils narrowed sharply.
“Wall Group…” he muttered through gritted teeth, his voice ice-cold. The plate was registered to Wall Group.
Fury surged within Alex. He wanted to confront Noah and demand an explanation.
“Noah Wall, what are you up to?” Alex slammed the desk, scattering papers.
He took a deep breath, calming himself.

###Chapter 532:
This wasn’t the time for rash actions; he needed the truth.
Picking up his phone, he dialed Noah’s number.
The phone rang unanswered.
A foreboding feeling settled in Alex’s heart.
He set the phone down, resolved to confront Noah in person to seek justice for his mother and address their failed collaboration.
Alex strode to the villa’s entrance, reaching for the car door when a familiar voice stopped him.
“Where are you going, Alex?”
He froze and turned around.
Terrance stood there, stern, with Aliza beside him, smiling sweetly.
“Dad…” Alex’s voice was hoarse, mixed feelings in his eyes.
“I already know about your mother’s abduction,” Terrance said gravely.
“Dad, you know?” Surprise flickered in Alex’s eyes; he hadn’t expected his father to be informed so swiftly.
“Yes, I do.” Terrance nodded, his expression grim. “I’ve sent people to investigate. Don’t worry.”
“Dad, I…” Alex began, but Terrance cut him off.
“What are you planning to do?” Terrance asked Alex with a serious tone.
“I’m going to confront Noah about my mom’s abduction and discuss our family’s collaboration with him,” Alex responded without hesitation.
“That’s nonsense!” Terrance roared. “You think he’ll just admit to it? Do you really think he’ll have a civil conversation with you? Wall Group has already made their move, which means they’ve broken ties with us. Why should we hold back?”
“Dad, are you saying…” Alex began, sensing more behind his father’s words.
gα?ησν?s?com is where imagination thrives
“I’ve decided,” Terrance said coldly, “Howe Group will go to war with Wall Group. They will pay for their actions.”
“We can’t do this, Dad. We…” Alex protested.
“Enough!” Terrance cut him off. “My decision is final.”
“Dad, did Aliza say something to you? She…” Alex asked, turning to Aliza with suspicion.
He believed she was the one causing trouble and stirring chaos. Aliza, upon hearing Alex’s words, adopted an innocent expression, gently shaking her head. She softly said, “Alex, what are you talking about? I haven’t done anything. How could I possibly speak ill of you to your father? Why don’t you trust me?”
As she spoke, her eyes slightly reddened, giving her a pitiful look.
Terrance, observing Aliza’s demeanor, felt a surge of sympathy.
He walked over to her, gently patting her shoulder to comfort her. “Aliza, don’t mind him. He’s been misled by that woman and can’t distinguish right from wrong.”
“Dad, you…” Alex grew even more upset as his father sided with Aliza.
“Guards!” Terrance called, and bodyguards quickly appeared.
They stood attentively before him, ready for his instructions.
“Take Alex to his room and make sure he stays there. He’s not to leave without my permission,” Terrance said coldly.
“You can’t do this, Dad!” Alex shouted, struggling against the guards.
“Take his phone too,” Terrance added.
The bodyguards quickly stepped forward, taking Alex’s phone from his hand.
“Let me go, Dad! I need to find my mother and confront Noah!” Alex shouted, struggling in vain as he was forcibly taken back to his room. The door closed with a heavy thud, leaving Alex slumped on the floor, defeated. noveldrama

###Chapter 533:
Terrance watched, a mix of emotions in his eyes, then turned to Aliza with a gentle tone.
“It’s been tough on you, Aliza. Alex is just confused right now; don’t take it personally.”
Aliza nodded, managing a weak smile.
“I’m fine, Mr. Howe. Alex is just overly concerned about Mrs. Howe. I’m sure he’ll come to understand my intentions eventually.”
“I’m glad to hear that,” Terrance responded. “It’s so good that you’ll be a member of the Howe family.” He handed Alex’s phone to Aliza. “Take this phone, Aliza. Move forward with our agreed plan.”
Aliza accepted the phone, her eyes flickering with a subtle gleam of satisfaction.
She nodded firmly, reassuring Terrance, “Please rest assured, Mr. Howe, I won’t let you down. I’ll ensure that Howe Group not only surpasses Wall Group but also becomes a leader in the business world.”
Terrance looked at her, nodding with satisfaction.
He was confident that with Aliza’s help, Howe Group would defeat Wall Group and reclaim its former glory.
He also believed that Alex, currently blinded by love, would eventually recognize who truly cared for him.
“Ugh…” Sadie groaned softly as she regained consciousness.
Her head throbbed painfully, and her vision was blurry, reflecting the physical turmoil she had endured.
She sat up despite the soreness racking her body.
Despite the bright sunlight streaming through the window, a chill settled in her heart.
g ? ln σ ν s?com, your fiction escape
The room was silent, and then, a text message alert cut through the quiet.
Struggling, Sadie reached for her phone, the screen’s glow harsh on her Squinting, she tried to make out the words on the screen.
The new message was from Alex.
She steadied herself, carefully reading each word of the message.
“Sadie, something has happened to your grandmother. She’s currently being treated in a hospital. Noah has intentionally kept this from you.”
The message struck Sadie like a bolt of lightning, sending shockwaves through her mind.
Her grandma was in a hospital?
Sadie’s pupils suddenly contracted, and an overwhelming mix of fear and sorrow engulfed her. Her chest felt heavy, and she suddenly found it hard to breathe.
Impossible… This couldn’t be happening!
Her grandmother had been perfectly fine just a few days ago. How could something happen to her so suddenly?noveldrama
Sadie refused to believe the news. Her hands began to shake, and the phone nearly slipped from her grasp.
She stared at the screen, wishing that it was all just a nightmare, that Alex’s next message would tell her that it was all a misunderstanding. She was yanked out of her daze when the second message arrived.
“I’ve arranged for someone to pick you up. Be careful!” It was brief, but the urgency was plain and unmistakable.
Sadie’s heart sank.
Alex would never joke about something like this. If he said that Laura was in critical condition, then it must be so.
Why had Noah kept this crucial information from her? 
.
.
.
###Chapter 534:
Her earlier gloom morphed into confusion and anger.
Why would Noah do such a thing?
But there was no time to dwell on it. Sadie took a deep breath to steady herself and calm her mind.
She couldn’t waste her energy blaming Noah; she needed to get to her grandmother as soon as possible.
Laura was her only source of support in this world. She couldn’t lose her.
When Sadie was finally calm enough to think clearly, she began to figure out a way to leave the hospital without a hitch.
Noah had gone to great lengths to prevent her from hearing such important news. It was only par for the course for him to have set up surveillance around her room, the entire hospital even, just to keep an eye on her.
If she acted rashly, she might be discovered before she could actually do anything.
Just then, a series of knocks came at the door.
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat. She felt her body tense up, and her fingers tightened around her phone.
“Come in,” she called out in the calmest voice she could manage. The door opened, and a young nurse walked in. She gave Sadie a professional smile as she walked over with a tray of medications.
“I’m here to change your dressing, Miss Hudson,” the nurse said kindly.noveldrama
Sadie said nothing and just watched her with wary eyes.
Sensing her apprehension, the nurse smiled again and said, “Please relax, Miss Hudson. I was sent by Mr. Howe to assist you.”
“Mr. Howe? Did she mean Alex?”
Sadie’s eyes widened slightly. She peered at the nurse, trying to figure out whether the latter was lying or not.
gα?ησνs?com has your next chapter
The nurse seemed to read her mind. She produced a note from her pocket and handed it to Sadie.
“Mr. Howe asked me to give this to you.”
Sadie took the note and quickly glanced at it. The handwriting was indeed Alex’s.
“Follow the plan, and be careful.”
Those few words were all it took to dispel most of Sadie’s doubts.
She looked back up at the nurse and nodded. “I see.”
The nurse breathed a small sigh of relief.
“Please don’t worry, Miss Hudson. I will help you leave the hospital.” She drew closer and added in a quieter voice, “I brought an extra nurse’s uniform. Change into it, put on a mask, and follow me. The guards posted outside your door are changing shifts. They won’t be paying much attention. I already planned the route you’re going to take. Just do as I say, and you’ll be out of the hospital in no time.”
The nurse pointed outside, and Sadie’s gaze followed the direction of her hand.
“You will go from here, walk straight down the corridor, then turn left at the end. You will go down the stairs and exit through the back door on the first floor. Someone is already waiting there for you.”
Sadie listened carefully and made sure to memorize the nurse’s instructions.
She was going to take the risks—all for her grandmother’s sake.
“I understand,” Sadie said with resolve.
Getting out of bed, she quickly shed her hospital gown and slid into the nurse’s uniform. It was a bit loose on her, but it had no significant impact on her movements.
Next, she put on the mask, which covered most of her face. 
.

###Chapter 535:
Sadie took a moment to stand in front of the mirror and observe her reflection.
“Miss Hudson, we need to go,” the nurse urged softly.
Sadie nodded and followed her out of the room.
Just as the nurse had predicted, the corridor was quiet except for their footfalls.
Even so, Sadie’s heart was pounding furiously inside her chest, and her palms had started to sweat.
She forced herself to stay calm, at least on the surface, and act like nothing was amiss.
She had no way of knowing what would happen next, or if she could even pull this escape off.
But she refused to back down. She couldn’t.noveldrama
Laura was waiting for her, and Sadie was determined to get to her as soon as possible.
At last, they reached the end of the corridor.
She made a left turn, went down the stairs to the first floor, and made a beeline for the back door.
Sadie followed the nurse’s directions to a tee.
Although her body was trembling slightly, her sense of purpose never wavered.
There, the back door, finally!
She was almost free.
Sadie quickened her pace, almost breaking into a run.
But then something unexpected and totally unplanned occurred.
A black sack was suddenly dropped over her head.
Everything went dark, and before Sadie could even react, she lost consciousness.
The hours ticked by, and someone entered Sadie’s hospital room.
Nanette entered Sadie’s hospital room with a thermos in hand, her face bright with a caring smile.
“Sadie, I brought your favorite chicken soup. Have some,” she said, approaching the bedside.
Her smile disappeared when she noticed the empty bed.
“Sadie? Where are you, Sadie?” Nanette’s voice trembled with worry as she set the thermos down and began searching the room.
“Sadie! Where are you? This isn’t funny.” Her voice escalated with urgency and fear.
Nanette searched every corner of the room but found no trace of Sadie. She realized the gravity of the situation, her heart sinking.
She rushed to the door and confronted the two bodyguards stationed there.
“What happened? Where is Sadie? Where did she go?”
The bodyguards exchanged confused looks.
“Miss Barton, we… we don’t know…”
“We’ve been here the whole time and didn’t see her leave.”
“What? You’ve been here the whole time and didn’t see her leave?” Nanette’s voice sharpened, her finger pointing accusingly at the bodyguards. “Incompetent! You can’t even keep an eye on one injured person. What will you do if something has happened to Sadie?”
The bodyguards, chastened and flustered, remained silent.
They too were panicking; Sadie’s disappearance was no trivial matter.
If Noah found out, they knew they’d be in deep trouble.
“What are you waiting for? Go find her!” Nanette commanded.
The bodyguards hurried off to search for Sadie. 
.

###Chapter 536:
Nanette’s anxiety escalated.
She pulled out her phone and dialed Samuel’s number.
The call connected immediately.
“Mr. Ford, Sadie is missing,” she said, her voice breaking.
“What? Miss Hudson is missing?” Samuel responded, his tone alarmed. “Don’t worry. I’ll inform Mr. Wall right away, and we’ll organize a search immediately.”
After ending the call, Nanette slumped into a chair, her hands covering her face as she began to cry.
Meanwhile, Samuel struggled to maintain his composure.
He understood that losing his temper wouldn’t help; finding Sadie was the priority.
He immediately called Noah. As soon as the call connected, Samuel urgently said, “Mr. Wall, Mrs. Wall has disappeared from the hospital.”
Noah, who had been lounging on the sofa idly caressing a wine glass, stiffened upon hearing the news, his demeanor turning imposing.
“What did you say?” His voice was low and ominous.
“Nanette just informed me that Mrs. Wall is missing from the hospital. The bodyguards insisted they were at the door the entire time and didn’t see her leave, yet she’s gone.” Samuel’s voice trembled, as he anticipated Noah’s reaction and the possible repercussions.
Noah stood abruptly, his movements swift as he grabbed his coat. The wine glass shattered in his hand, red wine seeping through his fingers — a stark and foreboding image.
Yet, he seemed unfazed by the pain, his eyes icily focused.
“Lock down the hospital! Check every exit thoroughly!” Noah commanded, his voice grave and commanding. “Leave no stone unturned. Find her!”
Explore fresh updates on g?lnσνes?com
Pausing for a second, he added, his tone even more foreboding, “Also, seal all exit routes from the city. Highways, railways, airports — inspect every mode of transport. Don’t let any suspicious individual or vehicle escape!”
“Understood, Mr. Wall. I’ll coordinate the search immediately,” Samuel responded, knowing better than to delay.
Noah donned his coat and strode out of the office with a fierce aura. Three years ago, he had lost Sadie once.noveldrama
Now, she had vanished again on his watch.
Noah clenched his fists tightly, his nails digging into his palms, drawing blood.
“Sadie, you better be safe… or I’ll make anyone who harmed you pay dearly,” he vowed, his voice low and hoarse.
Noah stepped into the elevator, hitting the button for the underground garage.
As the doors closed, they enclosed his surging wrath and determination.
The elevator began its rapid descent, mirroring the sinking feeling in his heart.
He couldn’t bear the thought of anything happening to Sadie. He was determined to prevent any harm from coming to her at all costs.
Samuel and his team arrived at the hospital, entering the room from which Sadie had disappeared.
Nanette was on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, while the two bodyguards stood nearby, visibly shaken.
“Mr. Ford, you must save Sadie… She must have been abducted by malevolent people…” Seeing Samuel, Nanette grasped him desperately, her voice choked with tears.
“Miss Barton, please calm down. We are doing everything in our power to find Miss Hudson.” Samuel reassured her, his face set with determination.
He then turned to the bodyguards, his tone sharp. “Explain how Miss Hudson disappeared on your watch!” 
.
.
.
###Chapter 537:
“You’ve been on duty here the whole time, right? How did you not hear anything? Explain!” Samuel demanded sternly.
The two bodyguards trembled with fear. One stammered, “Mr. Ford, we… we really didn’t see Miss Hudson leave. We’ve been here the entire time, not even blinking…”
“Exactly, Mr. Ford! We swear we weren’t negligent. But Miss Hudson just… vanished,” the other bodyguard quickly added.
“Idiots! How could you let this happen?” Samuel exploded in anger. “You can’t even keep an eye on one injured person. What’s the point of having you here?”
Frustrated, Samuel began to search the hospital room meticulously.
He checked the windows but found them untouched.
Looking under the bed revealed nothing unusual.
The room was spotless, indicating no struggle or disturbance had occurred.
Yet, Sadie was nowhere to be found.
Samuel’s heart sank.
He realized Sadie must have been taken by someone well-prepared, who left no trace behind.
“Start investigating immediately! Check for any suspicious individuals entering or leaving the hospital recently. Also, review the surveillance footage. Don’t overlook any corner!” Samuel instructed his team.
“Got it, Mr. Ford!” His subordinates sprang into action.
Samuel stood there, his brows furrowed, deep in thought.
Meanwhile, Noah’s car sped toward the hospital, disregarding traffic signals and likely accumulating fines.
But Noah was unconcerned about the penalties; his only focus was on Sadie’s safety.
Your new favorite is gα?ησν?s?c?m
Feeling as if his heart was being constricted, he silently prayed for Sadie’s well-being and safe return.
Soon, his car screeched to a halt at the hospital entrance.
He burst out of the car, his presence intense and commanding. As he strode into the hospital, his presence made others feel a heavy pressure, prompting them to step aside quickly.
Noah’s face was set in a grim expression, his eyes alight with a potent mix of anger and concern.
He rushed to Sadie’s hospital room, only to find the bed empty. His heart dropped, a wave of fear overtaking him.
“Where’s Sadie? Where has she gone?”
Noah’s voice was low and hoarse, tinged with a tremor of panic.
“Mr. Wall, what should we do now?” Samuel approached him and asked in a low voice.
Noah forced himself to remain calm.
“It’s not the time for rash actions; we need to analyze the situation methodically to find Sadie,” he stated.
“Investigate immediately! Check if the Howe or Perry family has made any unusual moves recently. Also, track their financial transactions for any suspicious activity,” Noah said to Samuel.noveldrama
“Yes, Mr. Wall!” Samuel quickly got to work.
Noah stood there, his fists clenched, his nails digging into his palms, drawing blood.
He closed his eyes, attempting to stabilize his emotions.
“Ugh…” Meanwhile, Sadie groaned softly, her eyelids heavy. Struggling, she managed to open her eyes.

###Chapter 538:
Instead of the familiar hospital room, she found herself in a dimly lit room.
The things around her were blurred.
The air was heavy with the smell of oil and smoke, causing her to cough.
“Ahem… Ahem…”
Trying to sit up, Sadie felt pain and weakness throughout her body, as if she had been crushed.
She realized she was lying on a worn, greasy sofa.
“Where… am I?” she murmured.
She remembered being ready to leave the hospital, and then nothing.
A wave of anxiety swept through her, causing her heart to race. Sadie compelled herself to remain calm, attempting to piece together the events that led up to her losing consciousness. She recalled receiving a text from Alex, saying her grandmother was in danger, then… a strange smell, and then darkness.
“Grandma…” Sadie’s heart sank.
She attempted to stand but discovered her hands and feet were tightly bound with ropes.
“Hello? Is anyone there?” she shouted, her voice echoing through the empty room, but there was no reply.
Fear engulfed her, and her body began to tremble slightly.
Sadie didn’t know where she was or who had taken her, but she knew she was in serious danger.
Just then, the sound of high heels clicking on the floor shattered the oppressive silence, echoing from a distance. The sound drew nearer, and Sadie’s heart raced.
She strained to see who was approaching, but her vision was as if obscured by a thick fog.
Discover what’s next on g?lnσνso
The footsteps halted a few steps away from her.
Then, a woman’s voice, laced with sarcasm, said, “You’re Sadie Hudson, aren’t you?”
That voice… Sadie racked her brain but found no trace of recognition. She was sure she had never heard this voice before, nor did she know this woman.
Yet, the malice in the woman’s tone was unmistakable.
“Who are you?” Sadie asked, her voice steady despite her fear.
She straightened her back, striving to seem less vulnerable.
Though she couldn’t see clearly, she was determined to maintain her composure and not reveal her fear.
“Who I am doesn’t matter,” the woman said, her tone thick with disdain.
The woman said, “You just need to know that you’re now under my control.”
“What about my grandmother? What have you done to her?” Sadie’s voice was urgent.
That was her primary concern.
She might neglect her own safety, but not Laura’s.
“Your grandmother?” The woman laughed shrilly, amused by the question. “You should be more concerned about yourself right now.” Sadie felt a crushing pain in her chest, as if an invisible hand were squeezing her heart, making it difficult to breathe.noveldrama
She mustered her courage and asked with a trembling voice, “What have you done to my grandmother?”
The woman ignored the question. Instead, she approached Sadie, crouched down, and gripped her chin with icy fingers, forcing Sadie to look up. “Well, well, well… You’re quite the beauty. No wonder men are taken with you.”
There was jealousy and resentment in the woman’s tone. “But it’s a pity. No matter how beautiful you are, you’re still blind.”

###Chapter 539:
Sadie stiffened. She hadn’t expected the woman to be aware of her blindness.
This revelation made her even more uneasy. She didn’t know who this woman was or what she intended.
“What… What do you want from me?” Sadie tried to sound bold despite her fear.
The woman stood, then called over her shoulder, “You guys, come here.” Following her command, Sadie heard multiple footsteps approaching, intensifying the sense of danger around her.
Though she was unable to see, she could feel a menacing presence radiating from them.
“These are my friends,” the woman said, her voice oozing malice. “They haven’t had the company of a woman in a long time. They’ll have their fun with you today.”
Sadie turned pale, understanding the woman’s vile intentions. She couldn’t believe someone could be so malevolent, wanting to degrade her in such a manner.
“Don’t you dare!” Sadie shouted, her voice laced with defiance but also fear. “Do you know who I am? You will regret this.”
“Who are you?” The woman cackled, as if Sadie’s claim was a joke. “Who do you think you are? You’re just a woman who’s been abandoned. A blind one, at that. A nobody.”
“You…” Sadie’s voice trembled with anger at the woman’s taunts, her desire to retaliate stifled by her helplessness.
“Enough talk. Let’s start,” a rough male voice said impatiently. “I’m eager to have my fun with her.”
“Right, boss. She’s quite the prize. This is going to be enjoyable,” another voice added, thick with lewd anticipation. Sadie’s entire body began to shake with fear.noveldrama
“Don’t worry, sweetheart. We’ll take good care of you,” a third man said as he advanced towards Sadie, reaching out to touch her face. Sadie’s eyes snapped open, her face contorted with fury and despair. “Get back! Don’t touch me!” she screamed at the top of her lungs, her voice raw with desperation.
“Wow! You’re quite fierce, aren’t you?” the man exclaimed, visibly startled by Sadie’s reaction, yet quickly breaking into laughter. “But I like it.”
  ? .
As he spoke, he reached out to grab Sadie’s arm.
Just then, the woman interrupted. “Hold on.”
The man paused, his hand mid-air, and turned to the woman in confusion. “What’s the matter, boss?”
“Don’t rush into it.”
The woman approached Sadie, crouched down, and with icy fingers, gripped her chin, forcing her to look up.
“Aren’t you curious about your grandmother’s condition? Your grandmother… she’s already dead.”
Sadie’s pupils narrowed sharply, and a wave of pain pierced her heart, overwhelming her, leaving her struggling to breathe.
“What… What did you say?” Sadie’s voice trembled as she spoke.
“I said, your grandmother is dead,” the woman said slowly, her tone cold and harsh. “She was hit by a car, and it was gruesome.”
“No… impossible… This can’t be true…”
Sadie began to shake, disbelief and denial coursing through her.
She murmured to herself, “You’re lying… You must be lying…”
“Lying?” The woman scoffed. “Why would I need to lie to you? Your grandmother’s death frees you from her care; you can chase after any man you want now.”
“You… You’re spouting nonsense!” Tears streamed down Sadie’s face. “My grandmother loves me dearly; how could I ever wish for her death? You’re evil, and karma will find you!”
“Karma will find me?” The woman laughed, a sound devoid of warmth. “Sadie, you’re in no position to threaten me. Think about what you’ll do next.”

###Chapter 540:
She then stood and signaled to the men behind her. “Take good care of Miss Hudson, but don’t kill her. She still has her uses.”
“Don’t worry, boss, we’ve got this,” one of the men replied with a malicious grin, advancing towards Sadie. “NO… please don’t Swoosh!” With a swift motion, rough hands tore at Sadie’s clothes, the sound of fabric ripping echoing in the bleak warehouse. “Stop struggling, sweetheart. We’ll take care of you,” one man sneered, his expression almost predatory.
“Your grandmother’s gone, and you might as well join her,” another man said, his movements growing more aggressive.noveldrama
Sadie fought back with the ferocity of a trapped animal, summoning strength she didn’t know she had.
She couldn’t give up; surrendering meant plunging into a dark void. “Let me go, you beasts!” Sadie’s voice was raspy with despair, but her eyes were sharp, piercing the men who dared to assault her.
“She’s got fire, but I like her even more,” one man said, irritated by her resistance, and slapped her hard.
Reeling from the blow, Sadie tasted blood at the corner of her mouth but clenched her teeth, refusing to show any weakness.
Even if it meant her life, Sadie would never yield to those brutes.
“Bitch!” the furious man shouted, grabbing her by the throat.
“You think you’re still a high and mighty designer? You’re nothing now, just a blind fool!”
As suffocation set in, Sadie’s complexion paled, yet her gaze remained defiant.
She had too much to live for—a child and unfinished business. She couldn’t die here.
“You shouldn’t have crossed our boss. Better start praying,” another man said, reaching for her belt.
gα?ησν?s?com has stories worth exploring
At that desperate moment, Sadie’s fingers found a brick.
With every ounce of her strength, she swung it hard at the nearest man’s head.
“Bang!” With a dull thud, the brick connected, and the man collapsed, blood spraying.
“Shit!” The scream reverberated around the warehouse, halting everyone in shock.
“You dare to kill?”
Regaining their senses, the men’s eyes blazed with fury as they advanced on Sadie like enraged animals.
“I’ll kill you!” One of them kicked Sadie in the stomach, sending her crashing to the floor.
Sadie curled up, the excruciating pain threatening to overpower her, but she bit her lip hard, determined not to cry out. “Get her! Finish her off!”
Blinded by rage and fear, the men unleashed a brutal assault of punches and kicks.
Sadie’s consciousness wavered; she knew she was on the brink.
Just as despair nearly overtook her, a resounding bang filled the air.
“Bang!” The warehouse door flew open with a crash, revealing a tall, imposing figure framed against the backlight, an aura of menace emanating from him.
It was Noah.
In her confused state, a moment of clarity sparked within Sadie. Emotions tangled within her—hope, relief, and… was it resentment?
She wasn’t sure.
All she knew was that Noah always showed up when she was in dire straits.
Noah’s gaze hardened as he took in the scene: Sadie lying in a pool of her own blood, her clothes torn, her body battered and on the edge of life.
He witnessed the thugs continuing their assault, their words laced with malice.

###Chapter 541:
“You’re dead meat!”
Noah’s voice cut through the chaos, cold and hard. He moved toward the thugs, each step emitting an intimidating force that made them involuntarily step back.
“Who… Who are you?”
“Who are you?” one of the thugs asked, his voice quivering as fear took hold. He was already shaken by Noah’s intimidating presence. Noah didn’t bother to respond. Instead, he lashed out with a brutal kick, sending the man hurtling through the air.
“Bang!”
The thug’s body slammed into the wall with a sickening impact before crumpling to the floor, his fate uncertain.
“Get him!”
The remaining men quickly realized there was no room for negotiation. They drew their daggers and lunged at Noah. Unarmed, Noah stood his ground, his expression unyielding.
He moved with lethal precision, every strike packing the force of a battering ram. His blows sent the thugs sprawling, their cries of pain echoing through the air. They barely had a chance to counter.
But even the strongest fighter can be overwhelmed when outnumbered and facing armed foes.
Before long, gashes marred Noah’s body, his clothes soaked with blood. Yet he showed no sign of pain, his gaze never wavering from Sadie, his eyes filled with anguish and determination.
Then, the wailing of approaching sirens sliced through the air.
“The cops are here! Run!”
Panic erupted among the thugs.
If the police got them, they were finished.
Without hesitation, they turned to flee, completely ignoring Sadie.
“Think you can get away? Not happening!” Noah sneered, stepping forward to cut off their escape.
There was no way he would let those who harmed Sadie get away.
“Take him down! No matter what!”
One thug, seeing no way out, went all in, swinging his blade toward Noah.
Noah dodged effortlessly, disarming the man with a swift kick before landing a devastating punch that sent him sprawling. Seeing their comrade fall, the rest charged in desperation.
Despite his skill, Noah struggled against the sheer numbers.
More wounds tore into his flesh, crimson streaking down his skin. “Noah…” Sadie’s voice was barely above a whisper, yet he heard it as if it were a scream.
He turned to her instantly.noveldrama
“Stop! We give up!” One of the thugs suddenly dropped his weapon and fell to his knees, realizing they were outmatched.
“Fools!” their leader spat in frustration, but even he saw no other choice. One by one, they surrendered, throwing themselves at Noah’s mercy.
“Sir, we made a mistake! It won’t happen again!”
“We were forced into this by the Howe family!”
“Exactly! It has nothing to do with us.”
Noah remained silent, his stare cold as ice.
Then, one thug, desperate to save his skin, blurted out something unforgivable.
“We’ve… already slept with her… We’ve all had our turn…”
“Yeah… she’s ruined…” 
.

###Chapter 542:
“Listen, we can get you other women—better ones…”
“If you want her safe… release Mrs. Susannah Howe…” The thugs stammered on.
Noah’s expression darkened. A murderous aura surged around him, suffocating the space.
He stepped forward.
“Say that again.” His voice was deathly calm, devoid of any emotion.
“We…” The men shrank back, terror gripping them. They no longer dared to speak, only frantically bowing in submission.
“You know what?” Noah’s voice was low but deadly. “If even a single hair on Sadie’s head is harmed, I swear—every last one of you, and everyone connected to you, will pay. The Howe family, the Perry family will all bleed for it.”
“Wh-Who are you?” one of the thugs stammered, his voice shaky as he struggled to conceal his fear in Noah’s presence.
At that moment, Samuel entered with a team of police officers, addressing Noah with deep respect.
“Mr. Wall, the perimeter is secure.”
The moment those words fell, the thugs went deathly pale, as if they’d seen a ghost.
“Mr. Wall?”
They never imagined that the man who had stormed in, risking his life for Sadie, was none other than Noah Wall—the CEO of Wall Group. They had assumed, at most, that he might be an assistant or a high-ranking subordinate of Noah.
Never in their wildest dreams did they expect him to show up personally.
Now, they realized they were doomed. Completely and utterly doomed.
Everyone knew who Noah was.
Even their own boss had to tread carefully around him.
“Mr. Wall, please! Have mercy on us!” one of them begged, his forehead nearly touching the floor.
“We swear—we won’t ever do this again. Just let us go! We have families!” Kneeling before Noah, the thugs pleaded for their lives, trembling violently.
But Noah remained unmoved, his gaze cold and unyielding.
These men had asked for trouble. He had no intention of wasting another second on them.
Without a word, he walked over to Sadie, gently lifting her into his arms.
“Sadie… are you alright?” His voice, thick with emotion, trembled with both worry and pain.
Sadie didn’t respond.
Her body hung limply against him, her face ashen, her breathing faint. Deep, raw wounds marred her fragile form, a sight that made Noah’s heart clench.
Holding her, Noah turned to leave.
“Take them all away. Under no circumstances should a single one escape!” Noah’s voice was icy and resolute, leaving no room for doubt.
“Yes, Mr. Wall,” Samuel replied swiftly, sensing Noah’s genuine fury.
Noah held Sadie close as he hurried out of the factory.
Half an hour later…
“Quick! Get the operating room ready! I need all department heads and specialists here now!”
Upon exiting the car, Noah sprinted towards the hospital entrance, carrying Sadie.
The hospital was already prepared for his arrival.
Specialists and chief physicians stood in two solemn lines, their eyes fixed on Sadie as Noah carried her in.

###Chapter 543:
They remained silent, wary of provoking Noah, a man of formidable authority.
The usually commanding hospital director now appeared visibly shaken, standing at the front like a subordinate who had made a severe error.
His face creased with worry, sweat dotting his forehead, his legs trembling uncontrollably.
“Mr… Mr. Wall…” The director approached with apprehension but was silenced by Noah’s stern look.
Noah walked past him without a second glance, his focus solely on Sadie.
The director, struck by Noah’s silent disdain, hurriedly followed, explaining as he tried to keep pace, “Mr. Wall, we’ve caught the nurse who misled Miss Hudson into leaving. We’ll handle her strictly and provide a full report. Please… don’t hold this against our hospital!”
Noah stopped abruptly.
He turned, towering over the director.
“A report?” Noah’s tone was deep and rough.noveldrama
“If anything happens to Sadie, I will ensure that every single person in this hospital—executives to janitors—will be sent to poverty-stricken wastelands without exception.”
“What? Please, show some leniency!” The director was so alarmed he nearly collapsed.
Falling to his knees, he clutched at Noah’s leg, pleading, “Mr. Wall, please! Miss Hudson is…”
Noah kicked him aside dismissively. “Save your excuses. I expect results.”
With that, he continued toward the operating room, still cradling Sadie.
g?lnσνs?c?m is a world of wonder
The director, ignoring his own discomfort, scrambled to his feet and called out, “Hurry! Follow them! Miss Hudson’s safety is crucial, or we’re all finished!”
The medical team snapped to action, quickly following Noah to the operating room.
Outside the operating room, the air was thick with tension.
Noah stood rigid by the door, his gaze fixed on the sealed entrance.
Memories from the abandoned factory replayed in his mind—the thugs’ mockery, Sadie’s cries, the terrible injuries she had suffered—all flashing before him like a tormenting slideshow.
Each recollection sliced through him, causing unbearable agony.
“Sadie, you have to make it. You must,” Noah whispered repeatedly.
As time dragged on, his heart pounded furiously, his breaths quickened, and his frame began to quiver.
“Mr. Wall, please, take a seat and rest,” a staff member murmured gently beside him.
Noah paid him no heed.
At last, the doors to the operating room swung open.
The hospital director stepped out, soaked in sweat, looking worn but with a trace of relief in his eyes.
“Mr. Wall, the surgery went well. Miss Hudson is out of danger and awake in the recovery room,” he said with careful optimism.
Noah’s tight chest relaxed slightly.
He exhaled deeply, feeling as though he had been pulled back from the edge of a cliff.
“However…” The director hesitated.
Noah tensed again, fixing his eyes on the director. “However, what?”
“Miss Hudson’s condition… it’s not looking promising,” the director said.
“What do you mean?” Noah’s voice turned icy once more. 
.

###Chapter 544:
“Physically, she’s stable, but mentally… it’s clear she’s been deeply shaken.”
He continued delicately, “We’ve done a comprehensive assessment, and it seems she… she doesn’t react to external stimuli… She… she’s like…”
“Like what?” Noah interjected sharply.
“Like… a lifeless statue,” the director finished reluctantly.
Noah reeled, staggering backward.
“How could this be?” he murmured, struggling to comprehend the reality of the situation.
Noah rushed into the recovery room.
There, Sadie lay motionless on the bed, her eyes shut, her face ashen, unresponsive to his voice.
“Sadie! Sadie, wake up! Look at me! It’s Noah,” he called, gripping her hand tightly in desperation. Yet, Sadie showed no sign of awareness.
“Mr. Wall, please, calm down. Miss Hudson needs her rest now,” the hospital director advised gently. “We recommend consulting a psychologist.”
“A psychologist?” Noah murmured, a realization dawning on him.
“Yes, a psychologist! How did I not think of that? Quickly, get me the best psychologists from around the world!”
“Certainly, Mr. Wall. I’ll arrange that immediately,” the director said, visibly relieved, and quickly exited.
Noah watched Sadie on the hospital bed, feeling as if his heart were being ripped out.
He tenderly stroked her cheek and whispered, “Sadie, don’t worry. I’m here for you. I’ll make sure you get better. I promise.”
Yet, Sadie remained unresponsive, her eyes closed, seemingly lost in a profound darkness.
Noah sat beside her, burying his face in his hands and taking a deep breath.
“If only I had arrived sooner, you wouldn’t have gone through so much…” His voice was heavy with regret and remorse. “I’m so sorry, Sadie…” Tears welled up in Noah’s eyes.
He held Sadie’s hand, repeating his apologies, but there was no response from her.
She was soon moved to a VIP ward.
Shortly after, a team of doctors rushed in, led by a distinguished psychologist, Dr. Briggs Turner, who wore gold-rimmed glasses and had graying hair.
Behind him, several younger doctors carried medical equipment.noveldrama
“Mr. Wall, this is Dr. Briggs Turner, a top expert in psychology in our country, specializing in post-traumatic stress disorder,” the hospital director said, mopping his brow.
Noah nodded, motioning for Briggs to start the evaluation.
Briggs carefully assessed Sadie, inquired about her history, and then performed a series of psychological tests.
As time slowly passed, Noah waited outside the ward, his anxiety mounting, wishing he could do more to help Sadie escape her darkness. About an hour later, Briggs came out, removing his glasses with a serious look.
“Mr. Wall, Miss Hudson’s prognosis is quite concerning,” he said slowly, each word heavy with implication.
“What do you mean by ‘concerning’?” Noah’s voice trembled, his mind racing with fear and disbelief.
“Miss Hudson is currently unresponsive to external stimuli. Our initial evaluation suggests she has severe post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD,” Briggs explained.
“PTSD…” Noah whispered. He was familiar with the term but never imagined it would be associated with Sadie. 
.
.
.
###Chapter 545:
“Yes. Miss Hudson has undergone significant psychological trauma, which has triggered a defensive shutdown in her brain. She’s disconnecting from the outside world to protect herself,” Briggs continued. “This condition is complex and will require long-term psychological counseling and careful management. We must avoid exposing her to any further stress, as the consequences could be severe.”
“Any further stress…” Noah echoed, his heart breaking.
The damage inflicted by the thugs wasn’t just physical; it was deeply psychological.
“I understand, Dr. Turner,” Noah’s voice was rough with emotion. “I’ll take all precautions to shield her from further harm.”
“Mr. Wall, it’s important to grasp the gravity of this situation,” Briggs nodded. “Right now, Miss Hudson needs stability and trust. Patience and consistent care will be key to helping her step back into the light.”
“Thank you, Dr. Turner. I appreciate your guidance,” Noah responded, striving for composure.
“That’s our responsibility. Please excuse us,” Briggs said as he and his team departed.
The hospital director approached cautiously. “Mr. Wall, we’ll step out now. Should you need anything, please let us know.”
Noah dismissed them with a wave, signaling that they could leave. Alone outside the ward, Noah paused at the door, peering through the glass at Sadie lying on the bed.
She was turned away from the door, curled up under the blanket as though cocooning herself from the world. Quietly, he pushed the door open and entered.
The room was silent except for the soft beeping of a monitor. Noah moved towards the bed, each step deliberate, wary of disturbing Sadie.
He observed her back, her shoulders quivering slightly. It was as if she was holding back a deep-seated anguish.
  ? .
“Sadie…” Noah called gently, his voice soft as a whisper, a tremor barely perceptible.noveldrama
Yet, Sadie remained still, curled up and silent, unresponsive to his presence.
Noah felt a heavy weight in his chest.
“Sadie, would you like to see Averi?” he asked gently.
He understood that Averi was dear to Sadie, the one she cherished most.
“If you’d like, I can arrange for him to come here immediately,” he added.
Sadie’s body tensed, yet she remained silent and unmoving.
Noah felt a surge of disappointment.
“Sadie, I understand you’re hurting and don’t want to speak right now. That’s okay… Just rest. I won’t bother you. I’ll be right outside, not going anywhere. If you need anything, just call me,” Noah said softly, his voice laden with helplessness and sorrow.
He gave Sadie a deep, meaningful look before quietly exiting the room and gently closing the door behind him.
As soon as the door clicked shut, Sadie sat up abruptly.
She clasped her head in her hands, her body shaking as she cried without making a sound.
Tears flooded down her cheeks, drenching her clothes, mirroring the anguish in her heart.
She yearned to scream, to release all her pent-up pain, but no sounds emerged. She could only cry silently, enduring her torment in solitude.
Outside, Noah leaned against the wall, listening to the faint sounds of Sadie’s sobs, feeling as though his heart was splitting.
He stayed outside her room all night.
He didn’t go back to the office or home, nor did he sit down to rest. Nurses approached several times, urging him to take a break, but he declined each offer.
Noah knew Sadie needed someone, and even if she didn’t want him close, he couldn’t bring himself to leave.

###Chapter 546:
He believed being there was the least he could do for her.
The harsh lights of the corridor cast a stark glow on his weary face.
“Mr. Wall,” Samuel’s deep voice suddenly broke through Noah’s reverie. “The thugs have confessed. They were acting under orders from the Howe family.”
Noah’s hands clenched into fists.
“The Howe family…”
“There’s more,” Samuel added, a hint of anger in his voice. “They all had a unique perfume scent on them.”
“A unique perfume scent?” Noah’s expression grew intense, sensing an unusual clue.
“Yes, it’s not a common brand,” Samuel confirmed. “And we’ve found out the abandoned factory is located on land owned by the Perry family.”
“The Perry family… You mean…” Noah murmured.
“Mr. Wall, I suspect it’s Aliza Perry,” Samuel stated confidently, his voice low. “She’s known for her distinctive perfume, and she has both the motive and the means for this.”
“Aliza Perry…” Noah echoed thoughtfully.
“Unbelievable,” Noah said sharply, his laugh tinged with fury, as cold as shards of ice. “The Howe family and the Perry family… both will pay for this.”
“There’s another matter, Mr. Wall…” Samuel hesitated, then added, “Terrance is here.”
“Terrance?” Noah’s expression hardened. “What does he want?”
“He’s… at the hospital entrance. He’s asking to see you.” Samuel’s voice lowered, picking up on Noah’s growing anger.
“To see me?” Noah scoffed, his tone filled with scorn. “He has the audacity to face me?”
g α? ησ ν ?s?com takes you away
“Tell him to get out of my face!” His command thundered through the corridor like a storm. “Tell him I have no desire to see him. He needs to leave immediately!”noveldrama
“Right away, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded promptly, turning to carry out the order.
At the hospital entrance, Terrance waited nervously, his face etched with lines of worry and his eyes dim, portraying a man much older than his years.
He had not anticipated such a sharp escalation.
This time, Noah was genuinely enraged.
Terrance realized he needed to defuse the situation quickly, or the Howe family would face severe repercussions.
“Mr. Howe, Mr. Wall refuses to see you,” Samuel delivered the message without warmth.
“Refuses to see me?” Terrance’s heart sank deeper. “Did Mr. Wall say anything else?”
“Mr. Wall told you…” Samuel paused for emphasis, before adding, “to get out of his face immediately.”
“Get out…” Terrance staggered, nearly falling over.
He understood that this was both Noah’s final rebuke and his greatest disgrace.
“Mr. Howe, are you alright?” his butler asked, quickly supporting him.
“I’m fine,” Terrance said dismissively, steadying himself. “Let’s go.” He turned and slowly walked away from the hospital, each step heavy with defeat.
Inside the hospital room, the space was softly lit by a warm yellow lamp beside the bed.
Noah sat by the bed, a hardcover edition of The Little Prince in his hands.
His voice was deep and resonant as he read aloud.
“The fox said, ‘To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox, like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world.'”

###Chapter 547:
Sadie lay quietly on the bed, her eyes closed, her complexion ghostly pale.
It appeared she was sleeping, yet she seemed lost in a world of her own, unresponsive to her surroundings.
Noah paused after reading each passage, his gaze lingering on her.
“Sadie,” he whispered gently.
But still, there was no response.
Her eyelashes twitched slightly, reminiscent of a butterfly’s delicate wings.
A sharp pang gripped Noah’s heart, as if it were being squeezed by an unseen hand.
He resumed reading, also sharing snippets of the outside world.
“Sadie, the weather is beautiful today—bright sunshine and a gentle breeze. The hospital garden is bursting with vibrant flowers. Once you’re better, I’ll take you there. What do you think? Also, the new project at my company is going well. Everyone’s putting in a lot of effort. We’ll have a celebration when you’re better, okay?”
Noah’s voice faded into silence.
He took Sadie’s hand in his, noting its chill.
He clasped it between his palms, trying to transfer some warmth.
“Ahem… Ahem…” A discreet cough from the doorway announced Breck’s presence. He was holding a bowl of steaming tonic soup while standing at the door.
“Mr. Wall, it’s time for Mrs. Wall’s tonic,” Breck said quietly.
Noah nodded, accepting the bowl. He gently spooned some soup to Sadie’s lips.
“Sadie, try to have some soup. It’s good for you,” he said softly, as if comforting a child.
Stay tuned for updates at g?lnσνs?c?m
Sadie remained still, her eyes closed.
Patiently, Noah continued to feed her, one spoonful at a time. The soup was bitter, causing Sadie’s eyebrows to knit together slightly, though she offered no resistance or attempt to spit it out.
A warm feeling spread through Noah’s chest.
After she had taken all the soup, Noah delicately wiped her mouth with a napkin.
His touch was careful and tender, as if he were handling something precious.
“Mr. Wall, about Averi…” Breck began hesitantly.
“What about Averi?” Noah’s brow furrowed.
“He’s insisting on seeing Mrs. Wall. We’ve tried to soothe him, but he’s adamant,” Breck explained, his expression troubled.
Noah paused for a moment before responding, “Bring him here.” Breck hesitated, then voiced his concern. “But, Mrs. Wall’s current condition… I’m worried…”
“It’s okay,” Noah said quickly. “Let him come. Maybe he can reach Sadie.”
Breck nodded and left to fetch Averi.
Soon after, Breck returned with Averi in tow.
Averi, clad in pajamas adorned with cartoon characters, rubbed his eyes, looking puzzled.
“Mr. Wall, what’s wrong with Mommy?” Averi asked innocently, standing beside the bed and gazing at Sadie.
Noah lifted Averi onto the bed next to Sadie.
“Mommy is very sick and needs to rest,” Noah explained gently.
“Mommy is sick? When will she be better?” Averi’s small face was filled with concern.
“Mommy will feel like herself again soon,” Noah reassured him, stroking his head.
Averi gently touched Sadie’s cheek with his little hand.
“Mommy, I miss you so much. Please get well soon,” he whispered, his voice breaking slightly.

###Chapter 548:
Sadie’s eyelashes fluttered more noticeably, and a tear escaped from her eye.
A wave of hope washed over Noah.
Sadie was responding; she could hear Averi, she felt his love.
“Mommy, remember? You promised to take me to the amusement park,” Averi continued, his voice hopeful. “And you said you’d buy me lots of toys.”
Sadie’s fingers twitched slightly.
Noah, observing every minor reaction, whispered encouragingly, “Sadie, Averi is here talking to you. Open your eyes and look at him, okay?”
Gradually, Sadie’s eyes fluttered open. Her gaze was vacant and unfocused, as though she had lost her connection to the world around her.
“Mommy!” Averi cried out joyfully, throwing his arms around her. Sadie stiffened for a moment, unaccustomed to the contact, but she didn’t pull away. Instead, she slowly lifted her hand and tenderly stroked Averi’s hair.
“Averi…” Her voice was faint and strained, as if echoing from a distant place.
“Mommy, you woke up!” Averi exclaimed, hugging her tightly, afraid she might slip away again.
As Sadie’s eyes slowly began to clear, she looked down at Averi, cradled in her arms, her gaze softening with warmth.
“Mommy is here, Averi,” she murmured weakly.
“Mommy, promise you’ll always stay with me,” Averi said, looking up at her with earnest eyes.
Sadie nodded gently. “I promise, Averi. I won’t leave you again.”
Noah stood to the side, watching Sadie and Averi embrace tightly, his heart a maelstrom of emotions.
As Sadie’s condition steadily improved, Noah returned to Wall Group.

The atmosphere in the CEO’s office was oppressively tense. Noah sat behind the expansive desk, his fingers tapping rhythmically on the surface, the dull thuds resonating ominously. His face remained as impassive as a frozen lake, yet his eyes smoldered with an intense fire, casting a chilling presence.
Standing before him, Samuel delivered the latest findings from their investigation.
“Mr. Wall, we’ve discovered that the Howe and Perry families have been collaborating closely, secretly acquiring various small- to medium-sized businesses. They are also attempting to lure away our core technology team.”
Samuel spoke in a low tone, bracing for Noah’s potential reaction.
“Really? They think forming an alliance against me will bring me down?” Noah scoffed, a sharp smile playing on his lips. “Do they actually believe this will defeat me?”
His voice, though not loud, carried a formidable authority that chilled the room.
“Mr. Wall, what’s our next move?” Samuel inquired cautiously.
“What’s our next move?” Noah pondered, rising slowly to approach the floor-to-ceiling window. “If they want a game, I’ll give them one,” he declared, turning to face Samuel with a piercing gaze. “Let it be known that Wall Group is venturing into the new energy sector, focusing on key initiatives…” He paused, his eyes gleaming coldly. “I want them to cough up everything they’ve taken.”
Samuel felt a surge of adrenaline. Noah’s responses were always swift and decisive. He was determined to exact a steep toll on those who dared harm Sadie.
As the stock market opened, a covert battle commenced. Wall Group unexpectedly announced its foray into the new energy market, pouring significant investment into several ventures. This move sparked widespread controversy.
Stocks linked to the Howe and Perry families tumbled dramatically, leaving market watchers dumbfounded. Simultaneously, a deluge of negative publicity involving the Howe and Perry Groups—ranging from quality lapses to tax evasion and unfair competition—saturated the media, plunging both corporations into a deep crisis.

###Chapter 549:
“What… What’s happening?” Terrance stared at the plummeting stock prices on his computer screen, his complexion turning pale, sweat forming on his forehead. He had never expected Noah’s counterattack to be so immediate and severe.
“He’s trying to destroy us,” Terrance said, his voice quivering with a hint of despair.
In the Perry Group’s chairman’s office, Elbert was similarly taken aback. He hadn’t foreseen Noah’s response to be so rapid and merciless.
“Dad, we can’t keep going like this. We need to find a way to counteract Noah,” Aliza said, her voice tinged with worry.
“I know! I know!” Elbert responded irritably, waving his hand dismissively. “But what can we possibly do?”
Both Perry and Howe Groups were facing intense pressure.
Just then, Elbert’s phone rang; it was Terrance on the line.
“Hello, Terrance. What’s the matter?” Elbert answered, his tone showing impatience.
“Elbert, this situation can’t go on!” Terrance’s voice was filled with urgency and panic.
Elbert scoffed. “Do you have a plan?”
“We…” Terrance started, but Elbert cut him off.
“Terrance, listen. We’re in this together, and there’s no escaping it,” Elbert’s tone was harsh and firm. “If you even think about backing out now, don’t expect any mercy from me.”
A chill ran through Terrance.
“Elbert, what… what do you mean?” Terrance stammered.
“What do I mean? My meaning is clear,” Elbert stated coldly. “Either we stand together, or we fall together. The choice is yours now.”

“You…” Terrance was so furious he trembled, yet he felt utterly powerless.
“Terrance, I suggest you act wisely. Know when to bend rather than continue futile resistance,” Elbert’s voice carried a veiled threat. “Or be prepared to face the consequences.” With that, Elbert ended the call.
Terrance listened to the disconnect tone, his expression darkening as his despair deepened.
Meanwhile, in the hospital’s VIP ward, Sadie cradled Averi, softly humming a lullaby. Averi’s face radiated joy as he gripped Sadie’s gown tightly, secure in his mother’s embrace.
“Mommy, your singing is so beautiful,” Averi said in his sweet, childish voice.
“If you enjoy it, Mommy will sing to you every day,” Sadie replied, her smile warm, her eyes shimmering with maternal love. She tenderly stroked Averi’s hair, feeling her heart soften.
As long as Averi grew up healthy and happy, she was prepared to sacrifice anything.
“Mommy, where’s Mr. Wall?” Averi suddenly asked.
Sadie’s smile wavered slightly; she was uncertain how to respond to Averi’s question. Her relationship with Noah was fraught with complexities, difficult for her to understand herself, let alone explain to a child.
“He is very busy with work right now. He’ll come visit us as soon as he can,” Sadie said, managing a smile.
“I see,” Averi replied, accepting her explanation without further question.
Despite his young age, Averi showed remarkable maturity. He understood that if his mother chose not to discuss something, it was best not to press her.noveldrama
As Sadie observed Averi’s considerate behavior, a wave of bitterness washed over her. She yearned to provide Averi with a complete family and a joyful childhood. Yet, reality was often unforgiving.
The relationship between her and Noah was laden with misunderstandings and pain. She doubted whether things could ever return to how they once were, nor did she know how to face Noah.

###Chapter 550:
Embracing Averi tightly, Sadie whispered into his ear, “Averi, Mommy will always protect you. I’ll never leave you.” Her voice was both resolute and tender. This was her vow to Averi and to herself. No matter what challenges the future might bring, she was determined to face them courageously—for Averi and for her own sake.
Late into the night, Noah returned to the hospital. He entered the room silently and found Sadie and Averi asleep. Sadie clutched Averi close, her expression one of weary devotion.
A surge of affection washed over Noah. He approached the bed, seated himself quietly, and gazed at Sadie. His look was soft and intense, as if he were trying to capture and preserve her image forever.
He reached out to gently stroke Sadie’s cheek, savoring the softness of her skin. His touch was feather-light. He was careful not to disturb her sleep.
Meanwhile, at the Howe family’s villa, the atmosphere was tense and silent. In the darkness of his room, Alex sat by the window, the glow of his phone screen the only light, displaying the continuous flow of news. “Sadie was kidnapped…”
“Damn it!” he muttered, his frustration manifesting as he punched the wall.
He had never expected the situation to escalate so dramatically. Furthermore, he found it hard to believe that his father, whom he had always looked up to, could be involved in something so drastic.
“This can’t just be my father’s doing…” Alex mused, his brow furrowed in thought. “Aliza… She must have orchestrated this. No, I need to uncover the truth.”
With that resolve, Alex stood up abruptly. He couldn’t sit idly by; he felt compelled to act on Sadie’s behalf.
Alex took a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves. He started to replay recent events in his mind, attempting to connect the dots. He recalled his mother’s sudden disappearance, his father’s shifting demeanor, Aliza’s increasing presence, and those enigmatic phone calls.
Gradually, one clue linked to another in his mind. The more Alex pondered, the more alarmed and angry he became. It was hard to accept that the father he had trusted could become such a monstrous figure.
“I need to find proof.” Alex’s hands clenched into fists, his nails digging into his palms. He was determined to reveal his father’s and Aliza’s true natures and to obtain justice for Sadie.
gα?ησν?s?com hosts captivating tales
Alex quietly opened his door and stepped into the hallway. The hallway was deserted and unnervingly silent. His heart pounding, he tiptoed toward his father’s study, convinced it contained many secrets.
The door to the study was shut tight, making his heart beat even faster. He took a deep breath and gently pushed the door open. Inside, the room was enveloped in darkness, unlit and still. Guided by the meager moonlight, Alex felt his way forward.
He reached the desk and started rummaging through it.
“What are you doing, Alex?” A cold voice suddenly cut through the silence.
Alex froze, slowly turning around.
Terrance stood in the doorway, his expression dark and foreboding.
Alex was caught off guard; he hadn’t anticipated his father’s sudden appearance.
“I asked what you are doing,” Terrance’s voice grew louder, tinged with anger.
“I was just looking for a book to read,” Alex said, his attempt at calmness faltering.
“A book?” Terrance scoffed. “Do you really expect me to believe that?” He approached Alex, examining him with a penetrating gaze.
“Are you investigating me?” Terrance’s tone was low and chilling.
“I’m not!” Alex responded emphatically, denying the accusation.
“Not?” Terrance grabbed Alex by the collar and slammed him against the wall. “You think I don’t know what you’re up to? You think I’m unaware of your involvement with that woman?” 
Alex’s face blanched.
“Listen to me. You’d better behave!” Terrance’s voice carried an unmistakable threat. “Or you’ll have no one to blame but yourself if I take harsh measures.”
“Dad! Why are you doing this?” Alex’s restraint broke, and he confronted his father loudly. “Why did you kidnap Sadie? Why are you working with the Perry family? What are you trying to achieve?”
“Silence!” Terrance bellowed. “You have no right to question my actions.” His voice was icy and unforgiving. “Everything I do is for the Howe family and our future.”
“Our future?” Alex laughed bitterly. “Is this so-called future built on the suffering of others? Is it really worth sacrificing your morals for? I’m so disappointed in you, Dad.”
“Shut your mouth!” Terrance raised a trembling hand, intending to slap Alex.
“Mr. Howe, what are you doing?” the family butler called out, his sudden presence breaking the tension.
The hapless man stood in the doorway, looking horrified as he processed the scene before him.
“Get out!” Terrance roared.
The butler flinched and fled quickly.
“Come on, Dad, be rational!” Alex pleaded when they were alone again. “You may think your plan is for the good of the Howe family, but you’re wrong. It will only lead us to ruin.”
“What do you know?” Terrance barked at him. “You know nothing!”
“Nothing?” Alex sneered. “I do know that you’ve been making mistake after mistake. I don’t want to see our family fall because of your actions!”
“You…” Terrance sputtered, too furious to get the rest of his words out.
“Dad, please, just stop!” Alex softened his tone slightly. “It’s not too late to turn back.”
“Impossible!” Terrance declared. “I won’t back down, no matter what! Noah must pay!”
“Seriously?” Alex asked, utterly bewildered. “But why? Why do you have such a deep-seated hatred for Noah? Is there something I don’t know?” 
“You don’t need to know,” Terrance snapped. “Just remember that I am your father. It may not look like it now, but everything I do is for your own good.”
“For my own good?” Alex echoed with a bitter laugh. “Do you think I’d buy that nonsense?”
“Believe whatever you want, then!”
“You’ve really changed, Dad.” Alex’s voice had turned quiet. He paused and gave his father a look of utter disappointment. “Somehow, you’ve become someone I no longer recognize, someone I fear.”
“I haven’t changed!” Terrance boomed. “I am still your father! I will always be your father.”
“No, you’re not.” Alex helplessly shook his head. “You’re not the father I once knew.”
Terrance gritted his teeth, his hands clenched into fists. “I’m not giving up, Dad.”
Alex met his angry gaze with one of determination. “I will stop you, and I will reveal your true nature!”
“I dare you!” Terrance yelled.
“You think I wouldn’t?” Alex countered arrogantly. “For Sadie, for the Howe family, I’m willing to do anything!”
“You…” Once again, Terrance was so overcome with rage that he could barely speak.
In the end, he called for his men. “Guards!”
A group of tall, burly men rushed into the room.
“Take Alex back to his room and keep a close eye on him!” Terrance ordered. “No one is allowed near him without my permission.”
“Yes, Mr. Howe!” the men responded in unison, stepping forward to restrain Alex.
“Let go of me! I said, let me go!” Alex tried to struggle, but he was outnumbered.
The bodyguards practically hauled him away.
Terrance watched them go, his expression dark and menacing.
“It’s you who have disappointed me, Alex,” he muttered to himself. “Since you refused to listen to me, you can’t blame me for using drastic measures.”
He turned to his desk, grabbed the phone, and dialed a number.
“It’s me,” Terrance’s voice was cold and ruthless. “Move the plan up… Yes, as soon as possible. I don’t want to see that woman again… What? Noah? Don’t worry about him. He has his own problems to deal with… Good. That’s all.”
When he hung up the phone, Terrance wore a sinister smile. “Just you wait, Noah. I will make you regret ever crossing me!”
Meanwhile, Alex had been safely locked inside his room.noveldrama
He suddenly remembered something.
He strode across the room to his desk, opened a drawer, and fished out an old phone.
It was his, from when he was much younger. It had gone unused for a long time.
Holding on to a glimmer of hope, he pressed the power button. The screen immediately lit up, and the battery icon was full.
A flicker of excitement crossed Alex’s eyes. He quickly dialed a number.
“Hello?” he said in a shaky voice. “It’s me. My father has locked me up… Yes, at home. Can you help me?”
A familiar voice came from the other end of the line. “Don’t worry, Alex. I’ll find a way to get you out.”
“Thank you,” Alex choked out. “You need to be careful. My father—”
“I know,” the other person interrupted. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll take care of everything.”
“Okay. I’ll be waiting.” 
Alex ended the call and finally felt a modicum of relief.
Sadie exhaled slowly, basking in the sense of peace and relief that surged in her chest. Sunlight streamed through the window, adding a layer of warmth to the room and to her heart.
A nurse pushed a wheelchair into the room and gave Sadie a professional smile. “Congratulations, Miss Hudson! You may be discharged today.”
Sadie nodded gratefully. She had been through so much in the past few weeks and had endured a lot of physical and emotional stress. Now, it was finally coming to an end.

###Chapter 551:
“Mommy, can we go home now?” Averi asked with wide, hopeful eyes.
“Yes, sweetheart. We can go home now,” Sadie replied softly, stroking his head.
At that moment, there was a knock on the hospital room door.
“Come in, please,” Sadie called out.
Jim entered, wearing his white coat, a document in hand and a gentle smile on his face.
“Congratulations on your discharge,” he said.
“Thank you,” Sadie responded with a smile.noveldrama
Jim paused, then turned to Averi. “Little guy, are you happy to go home today?”
Averi nodded enthusiastically, his face lighting up. “Yes! I can go home with Mommy now!”
Jim chuckled, then his expression turned serious as he faced Sadie.
“Sadie, there’s something I need to discuss with you.”
“What is it?” Sadie asked, sensing the seriousness in his tone.
“Alex contacted me,” Jim revealed.
Sadie’s expression changed, a mix of emotions passing over her face. “What did he say?” she inquired, her voice slightly wavering.
Jim glanced at Averi, then hesitated.
Understanding the situation, Sadie said to Averi, “Sweetie, can you wait in the car for Mommy? I need to talk to Jim for a moment, and then I’ll be right there.”
Averi, though slightly confused, nodded obediently. “Okay, Mommy. I’ll wait for you.”
After Averi left, Sadie faced Jim, ready to continue their conversation.
  ? .
After parting ways with Jim, Sadie took Averi back to Myrtlewood Estate.
Upon arriving, Averi hurried into the living room, eager to play with his toys.
Sadie watched him go, her face softening into a gentle smile.
“Welcome back, Mrs. Wall,” Breck greeted her respectfully as she entered.
“Thank you,” Sadie replied, then asked, “Where’s Noah?”
“Mr. Wall came home early today; he’s in the study,” Breck informed her.
Surprised, Sadie raised her eyebrows slightly. It was rare for Noah to be home so early. What was happening today?
A sense of unease settled in Sadie’s heart, but she composed herself and responded, “I see.”
She removed her coat, handed it to Breck, and then made her way toward the study.
Pausing at the door, Sadie took a deep breath and knocked softly.
“Enter,” came Noah’s deep, resonant voice from within.
Pushing the door open, Sadie stepped inside.
Noah was seated at his desk, a document in hand, his brow furrowed in thought.
As the door opened, he looked up, his eyes meeting Sadie’s.
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat.
Noah’s gaze was profound and enigmatic, like a vast, unreadable sea.
“You’re back,” he stated simply, setting aside the document.
“Yes,” Sadie replied, taking a seat across from him.
.
.
.
###Chapter 552:
“Why did you come back so early today?” she ventured cautiously.
Noah fixed his gaze on her. “I wrapped up early at the company, so I returned,” he explained, his voice even and emotionless.
Sadie observed him, her unease mounting.
She sensed that Noah was withholding something.
“Noah,” she started, her voice tinged with hesitation, “there’s something I need to discuss.”
“What is it?” he inquired.
Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Sadie revealed, “Alex… he wants to work with you.”
Noah’s expression sharpened immediately, his focus intensifying as he regarded Sadie.noveldrama
“Alex?” His tone was edged with a chill. “He wants to collaborate with you?”
“Yes,” Sadie confirmed. “He mentioned that his father orchestrated the recent events, and he’s looking to put an end to his father’s plan.”
A wry smile appeared on Noah’s lips.
“Put an end to his father’s plan? What right does he have to stop anything?”
Sadie met his gaze earnestly.
“He claims he has evidence of his father’s crimes and is willing to share it with you if you agree to collaborate.”
Noah paused, his expression unreadable as he considered her words. The study fell into an eerie silence, punctuated only by the soft ticking of the wall clock.
Sadie observed Noah, her anxiety mounting with each passing second.
“What do you think?” Noah finally broke the silence.
More content at gα?ησνs?c?m
Sadie was surprised; she hadn’t expected him to seek her opinion.
Sadie hesitated, searching for the right words. “I think it’s worth considering.”
“Really?” Noah’s voice held a hint of amusement. “Do you think I should trust him?”
“I don’t know,” Sadie admitted, shaking her head slightly.
Noah’s gaze was intense, filled with complex emotions.
Sadie’s heart felt heavy.
“I just…” She paused, struggling to find the words.
“Just what?” Noah prompted.
“I just don’t want you to be blindsided,” Sadie said, taking a deep breath and holding his gaze. “There’s a lot of bad blood between you and the Howe family, but I hope you can approach this calmly and not let anger cloud your judgment.”
Noah watched her, his expression softening slightly.
“I see,” he said slowly. “I’ll think about it.”
Sadie exhaled in relief.
“Thank you, Noah,” she murmured.
Sadie exited the study, closing the door softly behind her.
The gentle light in the hallway washed over her, yet it did little to lift the heaviness in her heart.
A persistent barrier of unspoken words seemed to separate her and Noah, making him seem distant.
As she descended the stairs, Noah’s penetrating gaze lingered in her mind.

###Chapter 553:
Would he place his trust in Alex?
“Mommy!” Averi’s sweet voice pierced her reverie. She turned to see him at the entrance to the living room, his large eyes brimming with curiosity.
Instantly, her heart warmed.
She approached and crouched to his level, asking softly, “What’s up, sweetheart?”
“Mommy, what were you and Mr. Wall talking about? You were in there for a long time,” Averi inquired, his head tilted inquisitively, gently pulling at Sadie’s sleeve.
“We were just discussing some work things, nothing for you to worry about,” Sadie reassured him, patting his head as she smiled.
“See?” Averi replied, his understanding partial.
His expression then brightened with excitement. “Mommy, I have good news! Great-grandma is back.”
“Great-grandma?” Sadie echoed, startled, her eyes immediately filling with tears.
Her grandmother!
It had been so long since she had seen her.
Since her kidnapping, she had lost contact with Laura. The worry had tormented Sadie, keeping her awake at night, yet she hesitated to inquire, fearing the worst.
“Yes, Mommy!” Averi beamed, waving his little hands. “Breck said Great-grandma wasn’t feeling well a while ago, so he took her to the hospital. Now she’s better and back home.”
Sadie was overwhelmed by emotion, her tears streaming down her cheeks.
She quickly stood and dashed toward the door.
“Mrs. Wall, you…” Breck began, startled by Sadie’s emotional state, but she was already past him, driven by an urgent need to see her grandmother.
At the villa’s entrance, a beloved figure stood, smiling warmly and waving.
It was her grandmother, the woman who had raised her and cherished her dearly.
“Grandma!” Sadie cried out, running into her grandmother’s open arms.
“Oh, my dear child! Why are you crying like this?” Laura gently stroked Sadie’s back with concern. “Has someone upset you? Tell Grandma, and I’ll take care of it.”
Clutching Laura tightly, Sadie let her tears flow unrestrained. She hadn’t wept so deeply, even during the torment at the hands of those thugs or in her darkest moments of survival.
Her deepest fear had always been harm coming to Laura, not her own suffering.
“Grandma, I’m fine…” Sadie managed to say between sobs. “I just… missed you so much…”
“Silly girl! Am I not right here with you? Look, I’m perfectly fine, aren’t I?” Laura soothed her, tenderly wiping away her tears. “Stop crying now, or you’ll ruin your beautiful face.”
Despite her efforts, Sadie found it impossible to stem the flow of tears.
“Grandma…” she choked out, her voice breaking. “Where have you been all this time? I was so worried…”
“It was just my old condition flaring up again. I had to stay in the hospital for a little while,” Laura explained lightly, trying to reassure her. “See? I’m back and better now. Don’t worry, okay?”noveldrama
Knowing Laura was minimizing her own troubles to spare her worry only deepened Sadie’s emotional pain.
“Grandma, I’m sorry…” Sadie whispered, her voice laden with regret and relief.
“Silly child, what are you apologizing for?” Laura gently stroked Sadie’s hair, speaking with warmth. “I never blame you. As long as you’re well, I’m at ease.”
.

###Chapter 554:
“Mommy, don’t cry, Great-grandma said she’s fine,” Averi chimed in, hugging Sadie’s leg, his voice filled with sincerity.
Sadie looked down at Averi, wiped away her tears, and managed a smile. “Okay, Mommy won’t cry anymore.”
“My dear, are you hungry?” Laura asked affectionately, turning her attention to Sadie. “Tell me what you’d like to eat. Grandma will make it for you.”
Sadie’s face brightened slightly. She sniffed and responded, “Could I have your pot roast, glazed chicken, and…”
She listed several dishes, all favorites from her childhood.
“Of course, of course. I’ll make them all.” Laura chuckled, her eyes twinkling with delight. “Just relax, and let Grandma take care of the cooking.”
With a sense of purpose, Laura rolled up her sleeves, prepared to head into the kitchen.
“Grandma, let me help you,” Sadie quickly said.
“No need, dear. You spend some time with Averi,” Laura declined gently, smiling. “The kitchen will be all smoky. You won’t like it.”
“But Grandma, I really want to help…” Sadie began, only to be interrupted by Laura.
“Be a good girl, will you?” Laura said with a kind smile. “Go on now. I’ve got this.”
Sadie gazed into Laura’s kind eyes and nodded. “Alright, Grandma. I’ll listen to you.”
Laura hoped to ease Sadie’s worries and wanted her to spend more time with Averi.
“That’s my good girl,” Laura said, smiling as she gently patted Sadie’s head before heading into the kitchen.noveldrama
Watching her grandmother walk away, Sadie felt a surge of warmth and gratitude.
It was comforting to have her grandmother around.
gα?ησν?som has it all
Sadie took Averi’s hand and led him to the living room.
“Averi, let’s play with some toys,” she suggested, smiling.
“Great!” Averi exclaimed, clapping his hands with excitement.
Sadie spent some time playing with Averi, sharing a few stories with him.
From the kitchen, the sounds of Laura cooking mingled with the enticing aroma of the food, soothing Sadie’s spirit.
In the study, Noah stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, a frown creasing his brow as he held his phone.
He called Samuel.
“Hello, Mr. Wall,” Samuel’s voice came through the phone, respectful as always.
“Contact Alex,” Noah instructed, his voice firm and cold. “Tell him I’m willing to collaborate with him.”
“Collaborate?” Samuel’s voice betrayed his surprise. He was clearly not expecting such a decision from Noah. “Mr. Wall, are you sure? Alex is…”
“I’m sure,” Noah cut him off, his tone decisive.
“Understood, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded. “I’ll reach out to Alex immediately.”
“Alright,” Noah concluded, ending the call.
In his dimly lit room, Alex sat dejectedly on a sofa, the faint light barely illuminating the space through heavy curtains.
He stared blankly at the floor, clutching his old phone—his only connection to the outside.
Suddenly, the phone screen lit up with an anonymous message. “Collaboration is possible, and the Howe family foundation can be preserved, but the patriarch of the Howe family must change.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 555:
Alex sat up quickly, his eyes narrowing.
This collaboration offered a way out of his current dilemma and a chance to retaliate.
The opportunity to preserve the Howe family foundation meant they wouldn’t face total ruin, providing a chance for resurgence.noveldrama
However, the requirement that “the patriarch of the Howe family must change” hit him hard.
It meant he had to overthrow his own father and take his place. Alex’s breath quickened, and he gripped the phone tighter, his knuckles whitening with the strain.
After a lengthy pause, Alex exhaled deeply, his expression hardening into one of resolve.
He rose and approached the mirror.
Reflected was a disheveled man with unruly hair and a rough beard, a stark contrast to his usually polished appearance. Taking a deep breath, Alex started grooming himself.
He combed his hair, shaved his beard, and changed into a crisp, clean outfit.
He then opened the door and stepped out.
“Mr. Howe.” The two guards at the door blocked his path, their faces devoid of emotion. “Your father has ordered that you cannot leave this room without his permission.”
“Step aside,” Alex commanded, his tone laced with authority. The guards looked at each other but didn’t move, loyal only to Terrance’s commands.
“Are you deaf?” Alex’s voice escalated, now marked by frustration. “I am the CEO of Howe Group. Do you really dare to stop me?”
“Mr. Howe, we are simply following orders. Please don’t make this difficult,” one guard implored, steeling himself.
  ? .
“Difficult?” Alex scoffed.
He advanced a step, his eyes piercing, his presence commanding. “Listen carefully. This isn’t a negotiation. It’s an order!” Alex emphasized each word sharply. “Move aside now!”
His formidable demeanor made the guards involuntarily step back.
“Go. Inform Terrance Howe,” Alex said, his voice steadier as he tried to regulate his emotions. “Tell him I’ve reached a decision.”
One guard nodded to the other, who then hurried off to convey the message to Terrance.
Alex stood resolutely, his fists clenched so tightly that his nails dug into his palms, causing him pain.
At that moment, however, the pain was the least of his concerns.
The wait seemed endless, each second stretched to its limit.
Though he appeared composed, Alex’s mind was stormy, replaying potential dialogues with his father, anticipating every conceivable argument.
The upcoming conversation would be treacherous, as a single misstep could spell disaster.
Soon, the guard returned.
“Mr. Howe, your father would like to see you,” he reported respectfully.
Alex proceeded, making his way to Terrance’s study.
Inside, the atmosphere was tense.
.

###Chapter 556:
Terrance sat behind his large mahogany desk in a wooden armchair, his expression stern, his eyes as sharp as a hawk’s, locking on Alex as he entered.
“Have you thought this through?” Terrance’s voice was rough, and he was weighed down by exhaustion. Alex stood firm before the desk, his gaze steady, unwavering.
“I have,” his words were quiet, yet resolute.
Terrance studied him, searching his son’s face for any sign of doubt, any hesitation.
But Alex’s expression was a locked vault—deep, impenetrable, unreadable.
At last, Terrance exhaled, his voice breaking the heavy silence. “And what’s your decision?”
Alex met his father’s gaze head-on. “I want to stand with you.”
For a fleeting moment, shock flickered in Terrance’s weary eyes, swiftly chased away by something far stronger—relief, pride.
He pushed himself up from his chair, crossing the space between them in two strides. His hands found Alex’s shoulders, gripping them tightly.
“Alex…” His voice wavered, thick with emotion. “You mean it? You truly mean it?”noveldrama
Alex nodded, his gaze steady, unwavering. “Dad, I was reckless before. I see that now. I understand one thing—family stands together. We row in the same boat, no matter how rough the waters.”
A slow smile spread across Terrance’s face, his eyes glistening with emotion. “Good! Good!”
He clapped Alex’s shoulder with pride evident in every gesture. “That’s the mark of a true Howe—brave, loyal, willing to bear responsibility!”
Then, without hesitation, Terrance’s voice rang out. “Hey, someone come over here!”
The butler, standing just beyond the threshold, stepped in without hesitation, his hands neatly clasped.
Discover endless worlds on gα?ησν?s﹒o
“Yes, sir? How may I help you?”
“Tell the security team—they no longer need to keep an eye on Alex. He goes where he pleases, without restriction.”
The butler gave a crisp nod. “Right away, sir.” He turned on his heel, disappearing down the hall.
A weight seemed to roll off Alex’s shoulders. He exhaled, the tension easing. It seemed he had made the right move.
Terrance sat back down in his chair and gestured for Alex to sit as well.
“Get comfortable,” he said. “Tonight, I’m taking you somewhere special.”
As night draped itself over the city, neon lights flickered to life, and Gold Vibrant Club loomed in the distance—a palace of wealth, excess, and whispered power.
Inside a spacious private room, the air felt stifling, heavy with unspoken tension.
At the head of the long table, Terrance sat in cold authority, his sharp gaze cutting through the room like a blade.
Behind him, Alex stood tall, his expression unreadable, a wall of quiet resolve.
Across from them, Elbert sat rigid, his face pale with suppressed frustration.
Aliza, pressed close to her father’s side, her fingers digging into his sleeve, looked shaken—her wide eyes flicking nervously between the men.
“Terrance, what do we do now?” Elbert’s voice was raw, hoarse with barely contained desperation. “Noah is tightening the noose. We’re running out of options.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 557:
A slow, humorless chuckle escaped Terrance. “Didn’t you once claim there was no need to panic? That whatever storm came, we’d weather it? And now? One push from Noah, and you’re already shaking?”
Elbert swallowed hard, his fingers gripping the table’s edge. “But—”
“No buts.” Terrance’s voice was final, sharp as steel.
Elbert hesitated, then let out a slow breath, his gaze flickering toward Alex.
For a long time, he had considered the young man an outsider, someone who would never truly stand with them. Yet now, in the moment of crisis, Alex was here—silent, steady, unwavering.
“Fine,” Elbert said through clenched teeth, “Then let’s figure out our next move.”
The four leaned in, voices low, urgency sharpening their every word. The discussion turned ruthless, dissecting every possible path, every calculated risk.noveldrama
The room pulsed with tension as time slipped away. Then—Bang!
The door burst open with a violent kick, slamming against the wall. The sound jolted everyone in the room. All four turned sharply toward the entrance.
Noah stood in the doorway, a storm incarnate. He was clad in a sleek black suit, his presence radiating cold authority, his sharp eyes scanning the room like a predator locking onto its prey.
Behind him, a squad of men loomed, each gripping a baseball bat.
The air inside the private room shifted—thickening with tension. A sharp cry broke the silence. Aliza shrieked, clutching onto Elbert, her whole body trembling.
Elbert’s face drained of color, but he pushed down his fear, forcing himself to stand. His voice, though shaken, still carried weight. “Noah, what the hell do you think you’re doing?”
Terrance was on his feet in an instant, eyes locking onto Noah, his expression a blend of fury and disbelief.
Why did Noah show up here?
Don’t miss fresh updates at g?lnσνls?c?m
Could it be…?
A terrifying possibility flashed through Terrance’s mind, but before he could voice it, a voice cut through the suffocating tension.
“Noah, you are finally here…”
All eyes turned as Alex stepped forward, emerging from behind his father.
His face was unreadable, his gaze steady—too steady, as if he had seen this moment coming long before it arrived.
A smirk ghosted across Noah’s lips, amusement flickering in his dark eyes as he met Alex’s gaze.
“Mr. Howe, you should focus on handling Howe family matters. Leave this one to me.”
Alex didn’t say a word at first. Instead, he turned, casting a long, weighted glance at Terrance, a silent storm brewing in his eyes. Then, in a voice barely above a whisper, he murmured, “Take care, Dad.” And just like that, he walked away. Not once did he look back.
Behind him, Terrance, Eliza, and Elbert stood frozen in stunned silence.
“You… what…” Terrance staggered, his hand trembling as he pointed after his son, his lips parting—but no words came.
The betrayal cut so deep, it left him speechless. His own son. His own flesh and blood.
Alex had sided with Noah.

###Chapter 558:
The realization slammed into him like a hammer, rage and devastation intertwining into something unbearable. His chest tightened, his vision blurred, and for a moment, the world around him swayed.
His knees nearly buckled, but through the fury and heartbreak, a single thought anchored him. At least Alex was safe.
Noah had left him in charge of the Howe family affairs, which meant he wouldn’t destroy their family outright.
There was still a sliver of hope.
A bitter relief washed over Terrance.
“Noah! Are you out of your fucking mind?” Elbert’s voice shattered the silence, raw with rage and desperation. “Touch me, and you’ll regret it! Do you have any idea who you’re messing with? I’m Elbert Perry—the head of the Perry family!”
Noah cast a cold glance at Elbert, his eyes filled with disdain as though he were observing a worm squirming on a hook.
Without uttering a word, Noah merely tilted his head slightly, signaling to Samuel beside him.
Samuel immediately understood, his expression stoic as he approached Elbert. He grabbed Elbert by the collar and hoisted him as though he were lifting a lightweight .
“Let go of me! Let go of me! You bastards! I’m calling the police! I’ll sue you!” Elbert shouted, struggling desperately and flailing his legs in an attempt to escape Samuel’s grasp. He had clearly underestimated Samuel.
Samuel, Noah’s long-time trusted aide, had faced numerous challenging situations over the years.
He let out a cold chuckle and then forcefully pushed Elbert to the floor. “Bang!” A dull thud echoed as Elbert’s body hit the floor, accompanied by a painful wail. “Ah!”
Unyielding, Samuel began to kick Elbert.

“This is for your disrespect.noveldrama
This is for not recognizing your place.
This is for crossing Mr. Wall.”
Each kick was delivered with chilling precision, Samuel’s voice icy and laced with menace.
The room resounded with the sounds of Elbert’s cries and Samuel’s relentless admonishment, creating a grim atmosphere.
Aliza, witnessing the sudden violence, was frozen in shock, her eyes wide and hands clasped over her mouth, too terrified to utter a sound.
Noah then turned his menacing gaze toward Aliza.
Feeling a cold terror wash over her, Aliza instinctively retreated, her only thought to flee this frightening scene.
Noah’s eyes bore a deadly seriousness.
It was no mere threat; his intent to harm was palpable.
Aliza was certain that any sudden movement on her part might prompt Noah to act on his lethal intentions.
“Mr. Wall…” Aliza stammered, her voice quivering, tears welling up in her eyes. “Please… spare me… I don’t know anything… I haven’t done anything…”
Noah remained silent, his gaze icy and unforgiving. His silence was more daunting than any verbal threat.
Aliza’s mental defenses shattered. She collapsed to her knees, her sobs uncontrollable.
.

###Chapter 559:
“Mr. Wall, I beg you. I really don’t know anything. Please, spare me. I’ll even beg on my knees…”
Her cries were loud and desperate. Her voice grew hoarse from pleading, yet she dared not stop.
However, Noah remained impassive.
He slowly raised his hand, pointing at Aliza, then dismissively waved it.
At his gesture, several bodyguards in black swiftly approached, seizing Aliza by the hair and pulling her to her feet.
“Let go of me! Let go of me! Help! Help!” Aliza screamed, struggling futilely against their iron grip.
They dragged her into a small room within the suite.
“No…” Aliza’s protests faded as the door closed behind her. Horrific screams, the heavy breathing of men, and crude language soon followed, painting a disturbing picture of the events unfolding inside.
Terrance stood by, witnessing the entire scene.
His complexion turned pale, his body trembling.
He had not anticipated Noah’s capacity for such ruthless cruelty.
“Mr. Wall…” Terrance’s voice shook, tinged with desperation. “Could you… could you perhaps spare the Perry family?”
Noah turned to look at Terrance, his expression still cold, utterly emotionless.
“What do you think, Mr. Howe?” Noah asked lightly, his tone indifferent.
A heavy dread settled in Terrance’s heart.
Noah’s actions today were driven by a desire for revenge, aiming to obliterate the Perry family completely.
Stay updated on g?lnσνs?c?m
And Terrance had also become a target of that revenge.
“Take him away,” Noah commanded calmly.
Immediately, two men in black approached, each taking Terrance by an arm.
“Where are you taking me?” Terrance struggled as he asked.
“You’ll see when you get there,” Noah replied coldly, offering no further explanation.
Terrance was escorted to a secluded rehabilitation center on the outskirts of the city. The setting was peaceful yet heavily secured.
His room was modestly furnished, clean, and orderly.
Terrance sat on the bed, his expression grim, his emotions a mix of confusion and resignation. Suddenly, the door swung open.
A familiar figure stood at the threshold.
“Susannah?” Terrance’s eyes widened in shock.
It was his wife, Susannah, at the door.
She was dressed simply yet elegantly, her hair slightly tousled, and her face showing signs of weariness, but she appeared fine.
“Terrance…” Susannah’s tears began to flow.
She hurried to the bedside, threw her arms around Terrance, and wept uncontrollably.
“Susannah, how did you get here? What’s happening?” Terrance embraced her, his mind racing with questions and unease.
“I don’t know,” Susannah cried. “Someone brought me here, and I’ve been here ever since…”

###Chapter 560:
Terrance’s thoughts were chaotic.
Noah hadn’t harmed Susannah.
He had detained them both in this facility but hadn’t subjected them to any physical cruelty. This was astonishing.
Given Noah’s known cruelty, he could have easily ordered them killed or subjected them to unbearable torture.
Yet he hadn’t.
Instead, he had simply confined them to this rehabilitation center. Terrance was left wondering about the purpose behind Noah’s actions. He was completely baffled.
The grandeur of Howe Manor was now cloaked in an air of desolation. Alex, dressed in a black suit, stood with a stern expression.
The once gentle and refined aura he radiated had given way to an intimidating presence that unnerved those around him.
He walked briskly through the long corridors, his footsteps echoing in the vast emptiness.
Servants and bodyguards, standing to the side, remained silent and motionless, hardly daring to breathe under his gaze.noveldrama
In just a few days, Alex had decisively purged Howe Manor of any disloyalty.
Anyone connected to Terrance or the Perry family had been mercilessly expelled.
The fortunate ones were simply ousted, while others vanished without a trace.
The entire estate seemed to resonate with an ominous scent of blood.
Simultaneously, the Perry family’s businesses across Helva toppled into bankruptcy, one after another.
The commercial empire that Elbert had carefully built disintegrated overnight.
L?ττ ch?ρτ?rs ιn glov?ls.?
The remnants of the Perry family, like a defeated army, hastily fled abroad, vowing never to return.
The once formidable Perry family had been completely dismantled.
As night descended and the city lights twinkled, Alex stood alone before a floor-to-ceiling window, surveying the cityscape.
He held a glass of red wine, gently swirling it, his expression unreadable.
Soon, the door opened, and Noah entered.
Despite showing signs of fatigue, his appearance was still impeccable.
“Sit,” Alex motioned to the sofa, inviting Noah to join him.
Without hesitation, Noah took a seat across from Alex, the weight of the atmosphere palpable between them.
Alex finished his wine in one gulp and then reached for the bottle to pour a glass for Noah.
“In the end, I owe you thanks,” Alex said, his tone light yet devoid of emotion. “Without your assistance, I couldn’t have neutralized the Perry family so efficiently.”
He paused, then added, “Regardless, you’re my friend. This drink is for you.”
He lifted his glass toward Noah.
Noah regarded Alex, his expression deep and inscrutable.
He remained silent, his glass untouched.

###Chapter 561:
Alex’s smile faltered.
“Noah, I realize you’re upset with me,” Alex began, setting his glass down, his voice tinged with bitterness. “But I did all this for Averi and her.”
Noah cut in, his tone icy and flat. “Alex, don’t dress it up as nobility. You know the full extent of your actions. If not for Averi, why would I have assisted you?”
Alex’s demeanor shifted, his hands forming fists. “What are you implying?” he asked, his voice rising slightly with anger.
“I’m being clear,” Noah responded sharply, his stare unwavering. “I can’t overlook what you did to Sadie. My help was for Averi’s sake, not yours.”
Alex’s complexion darkened. He rose swiftly, his eyes locking on Noah. “I love Sadie, and I won’t just walk away from her. If you want me to step back to repay you, then I reject it,” he declared firmly.
“If it comes down to a confrontation over her, I’m ready. I don’t fear you,” Noah said, his look becoming frosty. “Are you challenging me, Alex?”
“You might say that,” Alex retorted, standing his ground.
“Fine. So be it,” Noah said with a sneer. “We’ll see how this ends.” With those words, he stood and left.
“Noah!” Alex called after him. “Are you really going to turn against me over a woman?”
Noah stopped but did not turn around.
“Alex, you’re mistaken. It’s not about me turning against you; it’s about you betraying me. From the moment you took Sadie away from me three years ago, you chose to be my enemy. She is neither a bargaining chip nor a commodity. Remember that.”
With those words, Noah walked away, not once glancing back.
Alex remained where he stood, his expression dark and foreboding. His fists were clenched so tightly that his nails pierced his palms, drawing blood, yet he appeared unaware of the pain.
g?lnσνs．c?, a world of tales
Meanwhile, at Myrtlewood Estate, Sadie had just returned from picking up Averi from kindergarten.
Averi chatted excitedly, recounting his day at school to Sadie, who listened with a warm, attentive smile.
Hand in hand, they approached their home, their presence painting a picture of warmth and contentment.
As they reached the entrance of the villa, a familiar figure appeared. Samuel stood before them, his tall frame imposing, his gaze a complex mix of emotions as he watched Sadie.
Sadie’s expression shifted subtly.
She harbored no warmth for Samuel, Noah’s right-hand man, known for his involvement in many of Noah’s darker deeds.noveldrama
Preferring to keep her distance, she gripped Averi’s hand a little tighter and moved to pass by him, intent on entering the villa.
“Mrs. Wall, please wait a moment,” Samuel called out to Sadie.
Sadie paused, turning around slowly with a trace of detachment evident on her face.
“Is there something you need?” she asked, her voice steady, revealing no emotion.
Samuel observed her for a moment, exhaling softly before speaking.
“Mrs. Wall, I would like to have a word with you privately,” he said, glancing briefly at Averi, who blinked back with wide, curious eyes.
.

###Chapter 562:
Sadie looked down at her son, her voice gentle. “Averi, please go inside, Mommy needs to speak with Samuel.”
Averi nodded and hurried into the villa on his small legs.
Once he was inside, Sadie turned back to Samuel. “Let’s talk in the garden,” she suggested.
They walked to the garden of Myrtlewood Estate, where flowers blossomed abundantly and trees cast cool shadows.
They moved along the cobblestone path in silence until Samuel broke it.
“Mrs. Wall, how have you been these past three years?” he asked tentatively.
Sadie stopped and turned to him, her gaze icy.
“Whether I have been well or not is surely of little concern to you, Mr. Ford, isn’t it?” she responded coolly.
Samuel was taken aback, painfully aware of the resentment Sadie still felt about events from three years ago.
“Mrs. Wall, regarding what happened three years ago, Mr. Wall… He…”
Samuel attempted to explain.
“Mr. Ford,” Sadie cut him off, her tone both calm and assertive. “I am not interested in revisiting the past. If that’s the reason for your visit, then perhaps our conversation is over.”
She was determined not to dredge up old pain, having suffered enough already.
Samuel watched her determined stance, sighing in resignation. “Mrs. Wall, I realize you still hold grievances against Mr. Wall. But do you truly understand him?” he asked, his voice carrying a hint of urgency.
Sadie stopped but didn’t turn around.
“Three years ago, after you left, Mr. Wall… He was frantic trying to find you. He searched the entire city, utilizing every connection. You know, during that time, he barely slept—only two or three hours a night—and he lost a significant amount of weight. He…”noveldrama

Samuel’s voice faltered as if the memories of those days overwhelmed him.
Sadie’s body trembled slightly. She slowly turned to face Samuel, her eyes brimming with a tumult of emotions.
“Is all this true?” Her voice was hoarse, quivering almost imperceptibly.
Samuel nodded earnestly. “Absolutely, Mrs. Wall. Mr. Wall deeply regretted everything that happened three years ago. He…”
“Enough!” Sadie cut him off sharply, her emotions cresting. “Don’t say any more! I can’t bear to hear it!”
She covered her ears, shaking her head emphatically.
She didn’t want to hear about what Noah had endured for her, afraid it might sway her resolve, soften her heart.
Yet, inside, her heart ached deeply.
Samuel observed Sadie’s anguished expression, feeling a deep sympathy.
“Mrs. Wall, there’s something else you need to know,” he said, taking a deep breath.
Sadie lowered her hands and faced him, confusion clouding her eyes.
“Recently, your studio was vandalized, and there was your kidnapping…” Samuel spoke in a hushed tone, as if wary of eavesdroppers.
Sadie’s pupils dilated in shock as she absorbed his words, her voice trembling. “Why… Why are you bringing these up now?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 563:
“It was the Howe family and the Perry family working together,” Samuel revealed, emphasizing each word carefully.
“What? Are you telling me the truth?” Sadie exclaimed, her face instantly turning pale.
She had never imagined the two families were the ones behind it all.
“The issues with the Howe Group’s products were just the beginning. Mr. Wall reacted so fiercely because of these incidents,” Samuel explained.
Sadie swayed slightly, almost losing her balance.
She bit her lower lip hard, her nails digging into her palm with enough force to draw blood, though she seemed unaware of the pain.
It turned out that Noah had undertaken all those actions for her. Her heart was overwhelmed with a complex mix of emotions, too intricate to easily describe.
“Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall truly cares about you,” Samuel said gently, his eyes sympathetic as he watched her.
Sadie slowly closed her eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks. The history between her and Noah was fraught with misunderstandings and pain.
Could they ever return to how things once were?noveldrama
Sadie didn’t know.
She truly had no idea.
“Mr. Ford, thank you for telling me all this.” After a long silence, Sadie opened her eyes and looked at Samuel, her voice hoarse and tired. “I think… I need some time alone.”
“Of course, please… take care.” Samuel nodded, then turned to leave.
Left alone in the garden, Sadie felt the gentle breeze play with her hair. Her thoughts were chaotic.

She needed time to carefully consider her future with Noah and what their path forward might look like.
After what felt like an eternity, Sadie entered the villa slowly. Upon reaching the living room, she noticed Breck had already set the table for dinner.
“Good evening, Mrs. Wall. Welcome back,” he greeted.
“Good evening,” she responded, her tone detached.
“Dinner is ready. Would you like…” Breck attempted to continue, but Sadie cut him off.
“I’m not hungry. Please, go ahead without me.” She then turned and departed.
“Mrs. Wall…” Breck hesitated, wanting to continue but ultimately held back.
Returning to her room, Sadie showered and changed her clothes.
Approaching the dressing table, she gazed into the mirror.
The reflection revealed her pale skin and tired eyes.
She moved to the kitchen to cook some of Noah’s favorite dishes.
Her intention was clear; she wanted to do something special for him. In the kitchen, her expertise was evident as she chopped vegetables, stir-fried, and seasoned the dishes. Her actions were quick and practiced.
Soon, several enticing dishes were ready.
Sadie carefully arranged the dishes on the dining table, then went upstairs to put Averi to bed.
She lulled him to sleep with stories and songs until he was deeply asleep.
Afterward, she left his room silently.
.

###Chapter 564:
Back in her room, she noted the late hour.
Noah had yet to come home.
Worry crept in as she pondered if he was delayed by work.
She picked up her phone to call him but hesitated and set it back down.
Instead, she sat on the bed in silence, waiting.
Time slipped by until she heard footsteps outside.
Her heart quickened—Noah was home.
Downstairs, Noah entered, bringing with him a faint smell of alcohol and visible weariness.
He paused upon seeing the dishes laid out.
Sitting at the dining table, he began to eat.
“Not bad. After all, you do have a heart,” he remarked, his smile teasing.
The next morning, Sadie awoke early.
After freshening up, she donned a smart business suit and applied light makeup, her appearance now refreshed and energetic. She proceeded to Averi’s room and gently pushed the door open. Averi was sound asleep, his small form curled under the blanket like a little angel.
A gentle smile crossed Sadie’s face as she approached the bed and softly stroked her son’s hair.
“Rise and shine, my love.”
Averi rubbed his eyes and opened them sleepily. When he saw Sadie, his face lit up with a sweet smile.
“Good morning, Mommy!”
“Good morning. Come on, get up! Mommy will take you to breakfast.” She lifted him from the bed, helped him get dressed, and they went downstairs.noveldrama
g?lnσνsо opens doors to wonder
Breck had prepared breakfast.
“Good morning, Mrs. Wall, Averi. Breakfast is ready,” he said with respect.
“Thank you, Breck.” Sadie nodded and settled at the table with Averi on her lap.
She served him a bowl of fruit cereal along with some of his favorite dishes.
“Sweetheart, eat slowly. Don’t choke,” she cautioned.
“Okay!” Averi responded, beginning to eat his breakfast earnestly.
Watching her son’s delightful manners warmed Sadie’s heart. During breakfast, she engaged him in conversation about his kindergarten.
Averi excitedly recounted all the fun and interesting events from school.
Sadie listened attentively, responding occasionally; their exchange was warm and affectionate.
After breakfast, she dropped Averi off at kindergarten.
She watched him enter the gates, then turned to leave, heading to her studio.
Driving down the road, Sadie felt conflicted.
Samuel’s revelations about Noah the previous day had unsettled her emotions.
Uncertain about how to face Noah or what lay ahead, Sadie resolved to focus on her work for the time being.
Her responsibilities awaited her.
Upon arriving, Sadie noted the studio’s transformation after urgent renovations.
It was now spacious, bright, and stylishly modern.

###Chapter 565:
She nodded in approval; Nanette had managed everything perfectly.
“Sadie, you’re back to work!” Nanette exclaimed with a bright smile upon seeing her.
“I see the studio’s remodeling went well,” Sadie said with a smile.
“Of course! I made sure everyone worked hard. I even convinced them to put in extra hours to complete it sooner,” Nanette replied, lifting her chin with pride. “How are you feeling, by the way? Are you better now?”
“I feel perfectly fine. Thanks for asking.” Sadie patted Nanette’s shoulder. “Any news regarding the International Jewelry Design Competition?”
“Oh, gosh, yes!” Nanette clapped her hands excitedly. “Sadie, your work has been shortlisted. A small gala will be held tomorrow night, and the competition will officially start the day after. The organizers invited you to tomorrow’s party.”
“I see. Great, then. Please prepare an evening dress for me.”
“No problem!” Nanette patted her chest. “Leave everything to me.”
Sadie chuckled at her zeal, then walked over to her desk. She turned her laptop on and began going through the work that had piled up while she was gone.
She needed to finish everything as soon as possible, so she could fully focus on preparing for the contest.
Sadie was determined to prove herself in the industry. More importantly, she wanted to make the people who had hurt her pay. They were going to find out that she was no pushover.
Sadie buried herself in work and completely lost track of time. She only stopped when Nanette knocked on her door to remind her that it was time to clock out.
Sadie sat back and stretched, then gathered her purse and coat.
“Make sure to dress yourself up for tomorrow, okay?” Nanette said with a wink.

Sadie smiled. “Yes, yes. Got it.”
They parted ways outside the studio, and Sadie drove home.
The next evening, Sadie arrived at the party’s venue just before it started.
She was wearing a black, backless evening gown that accentuated her silhouette. Her long, dark hair was pinned up, drawing attention to her slender neck. Her makeup was light and exquisite, and she carried herself with grace and elegance that made heads turn her way.
Sadie glided through the crowd, exchanging pleasantries with designers and brand representatives. She maintained a polite smile throughout, one that exuded confidence and charm.
“Well, well, well.” A sharp, mocking voice suddenly broke through the mingling guests. “Isn’t this the famous designer, Miss Hudson?”
Sadie turned to see Vivi standing behind her, wearing a sneer. Vivi wore a tight, red dress that matched her bold makeup. While she made for a striking figure, she looked somewhat garish next to Sadie.
“Miss Quinn,” Sadie greeted calmly. “Long time no see.”noveldrama
“Long time no see?” Vivi scoffed. “I heard your studio ran into some trouble recently. To be honest, I thought you would be too ashamed to show your face at public events like this.”
Sadie’s lips curled into a subtle smile. “Sorry to disappoint you, but my studio and I are actually doing pretty well. But I heard you’ve been trying to secure a deal with Lawrence Group. That hasn’t exactly worked out, has it?”
Vivi’s expression darkened. She wasn’t expecting Sadie to know about this.
The Lawrence Group was a renowned jewelry brand in Helva, and one of Sadie’s long-time clients.
.
.
.
###Chapter 566:
Vivi had been trying to snatch them away, but the owner of Lawrence Group was indifferent to her offers, leaving her utterly frustrated.
“Don’t get too full of yourself, Sadie Hudson!” Vivi snapped through gritted teeth. “You think you’ve won? Let me tell you—it’s not over until the fat lady sings.”
“Is that so? I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.” Sadie’s smile grew brighter. “Feel free to reach out if you need anything, Miss Quinn. After all, I have excellent rapport with the owner of Lawrence Group.”
With that, Sadie gracefully turned and walked away, leaving Vivi fuming in place.
“Sadie Hudson, just you wait!” she muttered under her breath as she glared at Sadie’s retreating figure.
Hatred and envy burned in Vivi’s heart, and she vowed there and then that she would make Sadie pay.
She refused to believe that she would lose to someone like Sadie.
Meanwhile, Sadie plucked a glass of champagne from a passing waiter, then moved to a quiet corner.
She thought about her recent encounter and couldn’t help the sardonic smile that tugged at her lips.
Vivi was no better than a trivial troublemaker, with her petty and shortsighted antics. She was barely worth any attention.
Sadie swept her gaze across the crowd and soon landed on a familiar face—Alex.
He stood alone in another corner, a glass of red wine in hand. He looked distracted, like he was lost in his thoughts.
Sadie hesitated for a moment. She had initially planned to avoid him, but later figured that some things were simply inevitable.
Taking a deep breath, she steadied her emotions before making her way toward him.

“Hello, Alex,” Sadie called out softly.noveldrama
Alex turned at the sound of her voice. A flicker of surprise flashed in his eyes, only to be replaced by guilt and regret.
“Sadie…” he rasped, his voice shaking slightly. He set his glass down and drew closer, stopping just a step away from her.
“I owe you an apology, Sadie,” Alex said, his voice quiet, his head lowered.
Sadie could see his sincerity and remorse, and… some other emotion she couldn’t quite identify.
“About… Aliza and my mother… About the harm they caused you, I… I’m truly sorry.” Alex’s voice seemed to grow softer with each word, and he never dared to look up to meet Sadie’s eyes.
The scars left behind would never truly heal.
No matter how many times Alex apologized, the pain Sadie had endured could not be erased.
“And also… thank you.” Alex raised his voice slightly. “Thank you for passing the message to Noah.”
He did not elaborate, but he believed Sadie understood his meaning.
Sadie offered a gentle, faint yet sincere smile. “Alex, it was not your fault. You don’t need to apologize to me. You helped me a lot three years ago.” She met his gaze and continued slowly, “Consider that my way of returning the kindness you showed me.”
Alex felt a heavy weight in his heart, as if a massive stone pressed down on him, making it difficult to breathe.
.

###Chapter 567:
Returning the kindness…
Was it merely kindness?
Alex tried to speak, but a lump in his throat stopped him.
Not willing to surrender, he whispered, clinging to a sliver of hope, “Is this just… returning my kindness?”
His whisper was so soft it seemed only he could hear it, yet Sadie caught it.
Her heart skipped a beat, and she felt a flash of awkwardness.
She was aware of Alex’s feelings for her, but…
“I’m sorry, Alex.” Sadie lowered her gaze, avoiding his.
She said no more, but those words were enough to show her feelings.
A hint of sadness appeared in Alex’s eyes, quickly concealed.
He had come to terms with it, hadn’t he?noveldrama
From the start, he knew Noah was the only man in Sadie’s heart. Alex gave a bitter laugh and changed the topic.
“Some people over there were asking about you; perhaps you know them.”
He gestured towards a group on the other side of the banquet hall.
Sadie followed his gesture and nodded slightly.
“Alright, I’ll go say hello. Please excuse me.”
She did not look back at Alex as she walked toward the group. Alex remained still, watching her leave, his eyes reflecting a deep sea of loneliness and unspoken sorrow.
Approaching the group, Sadie smiled politely.
“Good evening.”
gα?ησν?s?cо, your storytelling home
“Good evening, Miss Hudson,” one of them began. “I am…”
He introduced himself, but Sadie did not catch his name clearly; she just nodded politely in response.
Her mind lingered on the conversation she had with Alex earlier.
She had hurt Alex, though she had no other option.
“Miss Hudson?” The person noticed Sadie’s distraction and called to her softly.
“Oh, sorry.” Sadie snapped back to reality and offered an apologetic smile. “What were you saying?”
“We wanted to ask…” The person repeated the question.
Sadie listened intently, nodding at times in response.
“Miss Hudson, we…” The person continued, but Sadie suddenly felt a wave of dizziness sweep over her.
Instinctively, she reached out to steady herself against the nearby table.
“Are you okay, Miss Hudson?” the person asked, noticing her discomfort.
“I’m fine,” Sadie replied, shaking her head as she tried to regain composure.
She did not want to be seen in a weakened state.
“Miss Hudson, you look pale. Would you like to take a break?” another person inquired with concern.
“That’s not necessary. Thank you.” Sadie managed a forced smile. “Let’s keep talking…”
Before she could finish, a familiar voice called out, “Hey, Sadie!”

###Chapter 568:
Sadie turned to see a tall figure approaching.
It was Amy.
She was dressed in a silver gown, her long hair flowing down her shoulders, her makeup impeccable, radiating an aura of authority.
“Amy?” Sadie expressed her surprise. “What brings you here?”
“Why can’t I be here?” Amy reached Sadie, examining her from head to toe. “Wow! Even after a few months, you haven’t changed at all, still as stunning as ever,” she remarked, lightly pinching Sadie’s cheek. “Have you lost weight? Are you on a diet?”
Sadie was amused by the gesture, and it significantly lifted the gloom in her heart.
“Why did you suddenly come to Helva?” Sadie inquired.
“For you, of course.” Amy blinked playfully. “I heard you made it to the next round of the International Jewelry Design Competition, so I had to come back to cheer you on.”
She paused, then added, “Plus, I’ve been invited to be a judge for the competition.”
“Really?” Sadie’s eyes sparkled with delight. “That’s wonderful!”
“Of course.” Amy lifted her chin with pride. “With me here, you’ll always have someone in your corner.”
Her gaze swept over the others present, carrying a subtle warning. Those who had intended to approach Sadie sensed her aura and quickly withdrew.
“Sadie, are you alright?” Amy’s tone softened as she turned her attention back to Sadie. “You seemed a bit pale earlier.”
“I’m alright, Amy. Just feeling a little drained,” Sadie responded casually.
“If you’re exhausted, you should rest,” Amy advised, gently taking Sadie’s hand and guiding her toward a quieter spot.noveldrama

“By the way, Vivi didn’t give you any trouble, did she?” Amy suddenly inquired.
Sadie shook her head. “No, she didn’t.”
She chose not to mention her earlier dispute with Vivi, not wanting to worry Amy.
“That’s a relief.” Amy exhaled, reassured.
“Thanks for caring,” Sadie said with a nod.
“Sadie, honestly, you shouldn’t let Vivi get to you,” Amy stated firmly, meeting her gaze.
“I know,” Sadie replied with a small smile. “I won’t let her affect me.” She had no intention of letting anyone bring her down.
“If you’re interested, the director position at Majestic Ego’s Helva branch is always open to you,” Amy said sincerely. “You’re the most talented designer I’ve ever met and the perfect fit for the role.”
Sadie was caught off guard; she hadn’t expected Amy to bring this up.
“Amy, I appreciate your kind words. It means a lot,” Sadie replied with a faint smile, gratitude reflecting in her eyes. “But I want to succeed on my own.”
She paused for a moment, then continued firmly, “I need to prove myself without relying on Majestic Ego’s platform. I believe I can still reach great heights on my own terms.”
Sadie had never been one to depend on others. She always preferred forging her own path rather than leaning on others.
Amy studied Sadie’s resolute expression and sighed in resignation.
She knew convincing Sadie wouldn’t be easy.

###Chapter 569:
“You stubborn girl,” Amy murmured, lightly tapping Sadie’s forehead. “But that’s just who you are, isn’t it?”
Amy admired not only Sadie’s creativity but also her unwavering spirit.
“Alright, since you’re so set on this, I won’t push anymore,” Amy said with a shrug. “But I can’t wait to see you shine in the competition.” She had complete faith in Sadie, certain she wouldn’t disappoint.
“I will,” Sadie assured, confidence gleaming in her eyes.
“Alright then, I should go mingle. Let me know if you need anything.”
Amy patted Sadie’s shoulder before disappearing into the crowd. She had plenty to take care of and couldn’t stay by Sadie’s side the entire evening.
As Amy walked away, Sadie felt a warmth spread in her chest.
Having a friend like her was truly a blessing.
Meanwhile, not far away, Vivi glared at Amy and Sadie, resentment and envy burning in her gaze.
She bit her lower lip and clenched her fists so tightly that her nails nearly pierced her skin.noveldrama
Why?
Why was Amy still so partial to Sadie?
After Sadie left Majestic Ego, she had become the chief designer, and she should have been the one standing beside Amy.
Earlier, she had approached Amy for a brief conversation, but Amy had barely engaged before making an excuse to walk away.
That dismissive attitude was humiliating. It filled Vivi with rage. She refused to accept this. She wouldn’t allow Sadie to overshadow her.
She would prove she was the superior designer—the one truly deserving of standing at the top.
Your imagination begins with gα?ησν?s﹒
Suddenly, the sharp sound of a ringing phone broke her thoughts.
Vivi glanced at the screen and saw her father’s name—Moses Quinn. She quickly answered, her tone respectful.
“Hello, Dad.”
“Where are you right now?” Moses asked.
“I’m at a banquet. Is something wrong?” Vivi replied, puzzled.
“Come home immediately. There’s something important we need to discuss,” Moses said with authority.
“But, Dad…” Vivi hesitated. “I still have—”
“No excuses!” Moses cut her off. “Get back here now!” Then the line went dead.
Vivi gripped her phone tightly, her face paling.
Her father had always been strict and unyielding.
She had no choice but to obey. Frustrated, she stomped her foot before storming out of the banquet hall.
Upon reaching the Quinn family’s residence, she stepped into the living room and immediately noticed Moses seated on the sofa alongside two unfamiliar men.
One was an elderly gentleman with silver hair but a commanding presence. The other was a striking young man who exuded confidence and prestige.
Vivi blinked, caught off guard. She didn’t recognize either of them.
“Dad, who are they?” she asked, perplexed.

###Chapter 570:
“Come here, Vivi. Let me introduce you,” Moses said as he rose to his feet, gesturing toward the older man. “This is Mr. Damian Olson from the Olson family.”
“This is Mr. Anson Olson,” Moses continued, pointing to the young man. “The heir of the Olson family.”
The Olson family?noveldrama
Vivi’s heart skipped a beat. She had heard of the influential Olson family—a well-known and powerful materials supplier in Helva. She quickly stepped forward and greeted the two men with a polite smile.
“Hello, I’m Vivi.”
“Good to see you, Vivi. You’ve become more and more beautiful,” Damian said, returning her smile. “Moses, you’re truly blessed to have such an outstanding daughter.”
“You’re too kind, Damian,” Moses replied modestly. “Vivi is still young and has much to learn.”
Damian waved a dismissive hand. “Young people have all the time in the world. In any case, I’ve heard that Vivi used to work at Majestic Ego as the chief designer. Is that true?”
“Yes, she did.” Moses nodded. “Vivi is quite talented in that area.”
“That’s wonderful!” Damian’s eyes gleamed with interest. “The Olson family could benefit from someone like Vivi.”
“Damit, do you mean to say…” Moses trailed off, his tone laced with both anticipation and uncertainty.
“I mean that our families can enter a partnership,” Damian said. “We will provide quality materials, and Vivi can handle the design aspect. I must say, a powerful alliance like ours may well make a breakthrough in the jewelry industry.”
“Well…” Moses hesitated, sensing that Damian was suggesting more than just a business collaboration. The man was hinting at a marital agreement.
“Gentlemen, please take your time discussing business. I’ll go make you some coffee.” Vivi quickly found an excuse to leave. She didn’t want to be a part of such conversations.

“Go ahead, Vivi.” Moses nodded his agreement.
Relieved, Vivi stood and scurried into the kitchen.
Her thoughts were racing.
A marriage alliance with the Olson family…
Truth be told, she didn’t want to marry someone she didn’t love, much less marry for the sake of her family’s interests.
But what could she do?
“What are you thinking about, Vivi?”
Moses had entered the kitchen without her noticing, and he now stood behind her.
“Dad, I…” Vivi turned around and was greeted by her father’s grave expression. Her words died in her throat.
“Are you unwilling to marry into the Olson family?” Moses asked.
Vivi was silent, but the look on her face said it all.
Moses sighed. “I know you don’t want to do it, but this is going to ensure the future of the Quinn family. You need to make this sacrifice.”
“Is there no other way?” Vivi asked, her eyes welling up with tears. “I don’t want to marry someone I don’t love.”
“No,” Moses replied, shaking his head. “There is no other way. The Olson family is our best option. We need them to climb the social ladder and rise to the next level.”

###Chapter 571:
“But—”
“Don’t say anything else, Vivi,” Moses interrupted, his tone firmer this time. “Everything has been decided. You have no choice in the matter.”
Vivi closed her eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks.
“Enough!” Moses suddenly snapped. “Stop crying. Make the coffee and bring it out.”
“Yes, Dad.” Vivi wiped her tears away and swallowed the sorrow and indignation she felt.
Once the coffee was ready, she prepared a tray and carried it out of the kitchen.
Damian and Anson had made themselves at home in the living room, and they were happily chatting away with her father.
“Please have some coffee,” Vivi said as she placed the tray on the table in front of them.
“Vivi is such a dutiful and considerate young lady,” Damian remarked with a smile. “Anson, make sure you treat her well in the future.”
“Of course, I will, Grandpa.” Anson turned to Vivi, his eyes twinkling with something akin to admiration.
Vivi felt awkward under his gaze. She lowered her head, avoiding eye contact.
“Moses, I think these two are quite a match. Why don’t we…” Damian raised his eyebrows and shot Moses a meaningful look.
“Actually, Damian,” Moses said, “Vivi has just recently returned from abroad. She isn’t all that familiar with the situation in Helva yet. Why don’t we let these two young ones spend some time together first? Once they get used to each other, then we can discuss…”
Marriage.” Moses didn’t want to pressure his daughter too much. She was his only daughter, after all, and he still wanted her to be happy.
“That sounds good,” Damian agreed. “They do need some time to get to know each other.”
“Then it’s settled.” Moses beamed. “Vivi, see our friends out.”
“Yes, Dad.” Vivi rose and followed the two men to the front door.
After seeing them off, Vivi turned and walked back to the living room.
“Dad, do you really want me to marry Anson?” she demanded, her eyes flashing with defiance. “Are they really worth that much?” Once she started speaking her mind, she couldn’t seem to stop. “They’re just a materials supplier. They’re practically nothing compared to the Wall family.”
Vivi paused before continuing, her tone laced with frustration. “Dad, haven’t you always wanted me to marry Noah? Why are you now asking me to marry Anson? Don’t you remember that Noah is our ideal choice?”
“Enough!” Moses snapped, his voice sharp with anger. “Do you think I don’t want that? But do you even have what it takes?”
His eyes bored into Vivi, disappointment evident. “You’ve had countless opportunities to win Noah over, yet what did you accomplish? You couldn’t even outshine someone as insignificant as Sadie.”
“Dad…” Vivi’s words caught in her throat. She was unable to refute her father’s scolding.
“Listen carefully,” Moses said, his voice firm. “I’m giving you just one more month. If you fail to secure Noah’s heart, you will marry Anson without complaint.”
“Dad…” Vivi’s eyes glistened with despair. “You can’t force me into this…”
“Why can’t I?” Moses’s tone turned icy.noveldrama

###Chapter 572:
“I’m only looking out for your future. If you bring nothing of value to our family, then what good are you?”
Vivi stood frozen, consumed by hopelessness.
After the banquet, Sadie had no intention of lingering—her mind was occupied with thoughts of Averi.
She changed out of her formal gown into something more relaxed and stepped outside the hotel alone.
The evening air carried a slight chill, prompting her to pull her coat tighter as she waited by the roadside to flag down a taxi. A short distance away, Alex’s vehicle came to a slow stop.
He lowered the window, his gaze settling on Sadie with a trace of concern, about to speak.
Just then, a sleek black Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up in front of her. The headlights dimmed, and the door swung open, revealing Noah’s tall, poised figure.
Alex’s expression darkened instantly, his fingers clenching around the steering wheel.
He stared at Sadie, emotions swirling in his eyes.
Once again, he was a step too late.
“Get in,” Noah instructed, his deep voice calm and unreadable.
Sadie hesitated, caught off guard by his unexpected arrival.
“Why are you here?” she asked.
Before he could respond, a cheerful voice rang out from inside the car, brimming with excitement.
“Mommy!”
Sadie turned toward the sound, her eyes widening as she spotted Averi in the back seat, his face lighting up with pure joy.

“Averi? What are you doing here?” she asked, both surprised and delighted as she moved closer.
“I missed you, Mommy.” Averi pouted, his voice endearing. “I wanted to have a meal with you, so I asked Mr. Wall to bring me here.”
He still called Noah “Mr. Wall.”
Sadie’s heart warmed at his words. She reached out to stroke his soft hair, her voice gentle. “Alright, let’s go eat something together.” She turned her gaze to Noah, seeking confirmation.
He gave a slight nod, signaling his agreement.
Without hesitation, Sadie climbed into the car, cradling Averi in her arms.
As the Rolls-Royce glided away, Alex remained in his car, his face clouded with frustration.
He slammed his fist against the steering wheel, the loud thud echoing in the silent cabin.
Inside Noah’s car, the atmosphere was lighthearted.
“What do you feel like eating, Averi?” Sadie asked, holding her son close.
“Hmm…” Averi tapped his chin, thinking seriously. “I want a burger, fries, and ice cream!”
“Alright, whatever you want,” Sadie replied warmly, her expression full of affection.
Noah observed their interaction through the rearview mirror, a subtle, unreadable smile forming on his lips.
The car pulled into the underground parking lot of a luxury shopping center.noveldrama

###Chapter 573:
Noah took Averi’s hand while Sadie followed closely behind as they made their way inside.
The mall buzzed with activity, its lights bright and inviting.
Averi’s eyes darted around, curiosity lighting up his small face. Soon, they arrived at a fast-food restaurant and chose a table by the window.
Sadie placed an order for Averi’s requested meal, adding a salad for herself and a steak for Noah.
As they waited, Averi tugged at Sadie’s sleeve, pointing outside.
“Mommy, look! Those dresses are so pretty!”noveldrama
Sadie followed his gaze and saw a bridal shop’s display, its elegant white gowns shimmering under the store lights.
“When I grow up, I’ll buy you the most beautiful wedding dress,” Averi declared in his sweet, innocent voice.
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat. Her eyes softened as she looked at her son, emotions swirling inside her.
She and Noah had already gone their separate ways. The thought of ever wearing a wedding dress again felt impossibly distant.
“That’s so sweet of you, Averi. I’ll thank you in advance,” she said with a gentle smile, masking the tinge of sadness in her heart.
Just then, a young saleswoman from the bridal shop approached them, her tone enthusiastic.
“Excuse me, we’re from True Love Bridal Shop, and we’re currently running a special promotion. We can create a one-of-a-kind wedding gown for your beloved.”
The saleswoman looked at Sadie and Noah, beaming as she continued, “You two are truly a match made in heaven. And your son is just so adorable! What a nice family you have.”
Sadie’s cheeks flushed slightly. She started awkwardly, only to trail off.

She wanted to explain the situation, but she didn’t even know where to begin.
“Mommy, let’s go inside and take a look!” Averi excitedly grabbed Sadie’s hand.
Unable to resist his enthusiasm, Sadie could only follow him into the bridal shop.
Noah watched them disappear through the door, a mix of emotions crossing his eyes. Pocketing his hands, he followed them in silence.
A wide array of wedding dresses was displayed on seemingly endless racks. Each one looked magnificent, leaving anyone in awe at their masterful design and craftsmanship.
“Wow, Mommy! Look at this one! It’s covered with so many sparkling diamonds! So pretty!” Averi exclaimed, pointing at a dress adorned with Swarovski crystals.
“You’re right. It is beautiful,” Sadie replied with an indulgent smile.
“You two have great taste,” the saleswoman interjected. “This wedding dress is our store’s signature piece, the ‘Starlight.’ It symbolizes a love as brilliant and eternal as the stars in the sky. And this one, over here, is a piece we call ‘Enchanting.’ It is entirely hand-sewn, and the lace is handmade by tradesmen in Maradeiris. No one can go wrong with lace, especially with imported, high-quality lace. And this one…”
The saleswoman went on to introduce every dress, detailing their main features and the meaning behind their designs.
Sadie just smiled and listened, though her gaze would often linger on some of the dresses.
She finally settled on a simple yet exquisite piece. The dress had minimal embellishments, just a thin band of delicate pearls around the waist. It screamed elegance and class.

###Chapter 574:noveldrama
Sadie was immediately fond of it.
The entire time, Noah stood silently to the side, observing Sadie’s expression and noting every slight twitch of her lips or widening of her eyes.
Needless to say, he caught her interest on that particular dress, and made a mental note of it.
“What do you two think? Would you like to try one on?” the saleswoman finally asked, noticing that neither Sadie nor Noah had said anything.
Her words snapped Sadie back to the present.
“We, uh…” She glanced at Noah, then at Averi, her brows furrowed slightly.
She and Noah were already separated, so trying on a wedding dress seemed inappropriate.
“Mommy, please try one on,” Averi pleaded, tugging at her sleeve. “I want to see you in a wedding dress.”
Sadie still hesitated.
“Mommy, please! Pretty please!” Averi used his ultimate weapon—pursing his lips and giving his mother puppy-dog eyes.
Sadie couldn’t resist, of course.
“All right,” she said with a sigh. “I’ll try this one on.”
“Perfect!” The saleswoman happily clapped her hands. “Please come this way.”
She led Sadie to the fitting room, while Noah and Averi waited on the sofa outside.
Averi could barely sit still. He kept glancing toward the fitting room, then at Noah, looking anxious.
“Mr. Wall, what do you think Mommy will look like in a wedding dress?” he asked in his cute little voice.
“She will look stunning,” Noah answered without missing a beat, though his hands paused briefly from flipping through a magazine. His tone was tender, yet certain.

He still remembered their wedding from five years ago. The whole thing was rushed; they didn’t even have a ceremony.
“Yeah!” Averi bobbed his head vigorously. “I think Mommy will look beautiful, too!”
Soon enough, the door of the fitting room opened.
Sadie slowly stepped out in the simple, pearl dress.
All at once, time stood still.
Both Noah and Averi were stunned by the sight before them.
Sadie’s slender figure perfectly showcased the dress.
Her face had a faint blush, a mix of shyness and joy in her eyes.
“You look great, Mommy!” Averi cried out as he bounded over to Sadie and hugged her waist.
Noah stood up, swallowing the lump in his throat as he approached Sadie.
“You look gorgeous,” he complimented, his soft voice trembling ever so slightly.
Sadie felt a bit uneasy under his gaze. She lowered her head, unable to meet his eyes.
“I knew it! You really are a perfect match! A couple made in heaven!” the saleswoman said again.
Her words only made Sadie’s face turn even redder.
Noah was her ex-husband. How could they be considered a couple made in heaven? Or just a couple, even?

###Chapter 575:
“Actually, we…” Sadie tried to explain again, but bailed in the end. She quickly turned away and escaped back into the fitting room. After changing back into her clothes, she grabbed Averi’s hand and practically dragged him to the door.
“Let’s go, Averi.”
Noah didn’t stop her, but his expression turned a little wistful. He turned to the saleswoman and nodded toward the dress Sadie had tried on.
“Please tailor that dress to fit her measurements.”
“Certainly, sir!” The saleswoman was so happy. “How would you like to pay?”
Noah handed over a black card.
“Please wait a moment.” The saleswoman took the card.
Noah said nothing more as she wrapped up the transaction. Then he walked out of the shop to catch up with Sadie and Averi. After having a late supper, they drove home in absolute silence.
Neither Sadie nor Noah said a word, and the air inside the car soon grew heavy with tension.
Averi kept glancing back and forth between his mother and Noah. Even at his young age, he could sense that something was not right.
“Mommy, why aren’t you saying anything?” Averi couldn’t help but ask.noveldrama
Sadie was at a loss for words.
Then Averi turned his attention to Noah.
“Mr. Wall, did you do something to upset Mommy?”
“No, I didn’t,” Noah replied calmly.
“Then why aren’t you both talking?” Averi continued to probe. He was met with yet another stretch of silence as the adults unanimously opted to avoid the subject.

The next day.
The first rays of morning sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a soft glow on Sadie’s delicate face.
She slowly opened her eyes and stretched. There was a spark of determination in her gaze.
Today was the design competition, the day she would face off against Vivi.
Taking a deep breath, Sadie got out of bed. She washed up and went to her vanity to prepare herself.
She looked at her reflection in the mirror—her skin was flawless as polished porcelain, her eyes bright and clear. She pulled her lustrous black hair into an elegant bun to accentuate her slender neck. Sadie chose a white pantsuit—simple yet chic—and paired it with nude heels. She was the picture of elegance and strength.
She struck a confident pose in front of the mirror and smiled.
“You can do this, Sadie!” she whispered to herself, her voice ringing out with resolve.
Just then, there was a soft knock on the bedroom door.
“Come in,” Sadie called out without thinking.
Noah stepped into the room, already dressed in a tailored black suit that complimented his tall frame.
He glanced at Sadie in the mirror, his eyes flashing with barely concealed admiration.
“Off to work?” Noah asked, his voice low and tender. He walked up to her and gently placed his hands on her shoulders.

###Chapter 576:
“Yes.” Sadie nodded and met his gaze in the mirror. “And you? Aren’t you going on a business trip today?”
“I am,” Noah replied quietly. His gaze turned deep, revealing none of his thoughts. “I need to fly out of town to take care of some things.” He paused for a few seconds before adding, “I might not be back tonight, so don’t wait up for me.”
“All right,” Sadie replied, ignoring the faint wave of disappointment that came over her.
But Noah had noticed. He turned her around and pressed a soft kiss on her forehead.
“Take care of yourself. Averi, too.”
“Of course.”
Sadie was taken aback by his actions, and her mind immediately raced back to their time in the bridal shop last night.
She balled her hands into loose fists.
“You take care, too.”
Noah gave Sadie one last, lingering look before turning to leave the bedroom.
Sadie watched him go, only withdrawing her gaze once he had disappeared through the door.
She took a deep, steadying breath, then reminded herself that this was not the time for personal matters. She had more important things to focus on.
A black car was waiting for Sadie when she stepped out of Myrtlewood Estate. She got in and headed to the competition venue.
The car smoothly navigated the wide roads, while Sadie peered out of the window and watched the passing scenery.
Her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, but one thing was clear—today’s competition was crucial.
L?tτ ?нαρτ?rs ιn glov?ls.
About half an hour later, the car finally pulled over in front of the venue.
As soon as Sadie got out of the vehicle, she was immediately struck by the scene in front of her.
A large crowd, comprising mostly of reporters and fans, had gathered outside the building. Camera shutters were going off nonstop, and microphones were thrust toward the driveway in anticipation of the arrivals.noveldrama
“Sandra! Sandra!”
“Miss Hudson! Miss Hudson!”
A handful of people called out Sadie’s name upon seeing her arrive.
Reporters approached her, surrounding her from all sides.
“Sandra, are you confident about your performance in today’s competition?”
“Sandra, do you think you can win the championship?”
“Sandra, can you give us a hint about your work?”
“Sandra…”
Sadie maintained a courteous smile in the face of all their questions. She held up a hand, prompting them to fall silent.
“Everyone, thank you for all your attention and support,” she said into a microphone, her voice ringing clear and melodious throughout the crowd.
“All I can really say for now is, let us wait and see how the competition turns out.”
Sadie’s lips curled into a charming smile, and her eyes sparkled with subtle confidence.

###Chapter 577:
“I have faith in my work. I won’t let you down.” Her response was the perfect balance of boldness and humility, leaving a lasting good impression on the media.
“Sandra really is quite extraordinary, isn’t she?”noveldrama
“Indeed! Such confidence and composure under this level of pressure are rare.”
“I believe her. She will definitely surprise us, and I look forward to it!”
They were all buzzing with admiration and anticipation for Sadie’s piece.
Just then, a sharp voice suddenly cut through the commotion.
“Humph! What a nice little act you’ve put on!”
Everyone turned in unison to see Kyla sauntering over, her face a mask of disdain.
She wore a lavish gown, and her makeup was meticulously applied, but neither could hide the burning jealousy and resentment radiating from her.
“Do you really think you can win against me, Sadie? Dream on!” Kyla snapped as she stopped in front of Sadie.
“Is that so?” Sadie said calmly, raising an eyebrow and peering at Kyla with mild interest. “It sounds like you’re very confident about your performance in today’s competition, Miss Wade.”
“Of course!” Kyla replied with a haughty lift of her chin.
“Hmm. Let us wait and see, shall we?” With that, Sadie walked past Kyla and made her way into the venue.
Kyla’s expression turned even uglier as she watched Sadie disappear into the venue.
“Just you wait, you bitch!” she muttered through gritted teeth. “I’ll make sure you lose everything today!”
Before long, the competition finally commenced.
Find the magic on g?lnσν?s?
The stage was spacious and brightly lit, ensuring that the audience’s attention was locked in on the participants.
The participants took turns stepping onto the stage to showcase their designs.
Vivi glided onto the stage in a fiery red gown, swaying her hips with every step she took.
She displayed her piece, “Heart of the Flame.” The main feature was a ruby centerpiece surrounded by tiny diamonds that glimmered under the lights.
“Wow, it’s so beautiful!”
“This is a truly unique design!”
“Vivi is really exceptional in this field.”
The audience erupted in praise and applause, which naturally brought a triumphant smile to Vivi’s face.
The contest continued, and more participants presented their work, one after another.
Each piece was a testament to its designer’s dedication and creativity, with a distinctive feature that reflected its creator’s personality.
Despite the tight competition, Vivi’s smug smile never wavered. Every so often, she would glance over at Sadie, as if to gloat over what she believed would be her inevitable victory.
Vivi could hardly wait for Sadie to present her design, fully convinced that it would mark the start of Sadie’s downfall.
Not only would Sadie lose her place in the competition, but she would also become the laughingstock of the entire design industry.

###Chapter 578:
Vivi’s smile widened into a grin.
At last, it was Sadie’s turn to take the stage.
All eyes were on her as the audience wondered what this designer, who had dominated the international scene for three years, had in store for them.
Sadie held her chin high as she walked onto the stage—the epitome of gentle elegance and grace.
Unlike the other contestants, however, she didn’t place her work on the display table but held it up with her own hands.
“Good day, judges, fellow participants, and everyone who has taken the time to join us here today,” Sadie’s voice was clear and pleasant. “I present to you my work, titled, ‘Rebirth.'”
She slowly opened the box she was holding.
By that point, everyone was on the edge of their seats, their eyes glued to the contents of the box.
Nestled in velvet was a dazzling piece of jewelry.
And it was completely different from the design draft Nanette had stolen from Sadie’s studio. It was a new design altogether.
The piece featured a rare blue diamond as the centerpiece, surrounded by countless small, white diamonds. From afar, it looked like a tiny constellation around a full moon.
The concept was simple enough, but it was crafted in a way that screamed modern grandeur.
“Whoa!”
“It’s stunning!”

“Now, that is a masterpiece!”noveldrama
The discussion among the crowd grew louder and more animated. Both Vivi and Kyla were stunned in their seats, their jaws hanging open, their eyes wide with shock and disbelief.
“How… How is this possible?” Vivi mused aloud. “Her piece is completely different from the one before!”
“What the hell is going on?” Kyla exclaimed, equally bewildered by this unexpected turn of events.
They had both assumed that Sadie would present the stolen design. But here she was, showcasing a whole new creation, catching Vivi and Kyla off guard and effectively ruining their plans.
“Sadie, you… You actually…” Vivi pointed a trembling finger at Sadie, too furious to complete her sentence.
Sadie smirked at her. “Are you disappointed, Miss Quinn?” she asked, her voice calm yet mocking. “Did you really think I’d be foolish enough to fall into your trap?”
Vivi’s face turned ashen.
Not only had Sadie discovered their scheme, but she had also managed to thwart it altogether.
“Don’t get too smug, Sadie!” Vivi spat out. “So what if you made another design? That’s not a guarantee that you will win against me!”
“Is that so?” Sadie raised an eyebrow. “Like I kept saying, let’s wait for the results and see.”
Then she turned away from Vivi and faced the panel of judges. She proceeded to explain her design, down to the last detail.
As Sadie spoke passionately about her inspiration, a staff member suddenly rushed over to Garrett Schultz, the main judge, and whispered something in his ear.

###Chapter 579:
Garrett’s brows immediately furrowed, and his expression turned grim. The judges, who had previously been quiet and stern, were now abuzz with hushed discussions.
This did not escape the audience’s attention, and they began to exchange speculations on what might have occurred.
“What’s happening? Something seems off with the judges.”
“I have no idea. Perhaps there’s been a change in the competition results?”
“No way. The participants haven’t even finished presenting their designs. How could there be results already?”
“He’s right. Don’t be ridiculous.”
The conversation continued, with everyone putting forth their opinions. Vivi had also noticed the strange behavior of the judges. An inexplicable sense of foreboding welled up inside her.
“Did something happen?” she murmured to herself.
Just then, the same staff member stepped forward. He spoke into the microphone, his voice booming throughout the venue.
“Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the interruption.” His voice was thick with tension. “We have just received an anonymous tip accusing Miss Vivi Quinn of plagiarism, which disqualifies her from the competition.”
This, of course, caused an uproar among the crowd.
All heads turned to Vivi, their faces ranging from astonishment to rage. Vivi’s eyes were wide with horror and disbelief as she stared at the staff member.
“What—what did you say?” she asked, her voice hoarse and shaky.
“Say that again!”

“Miss Quinn, we received an allegation that you have plagiarized another designer’s work. That makes you ineligible for this competition,” the staff member repeated without batting an eye.
“That’s absolutely impossible!” Vivi screamed. “All my pieces are original! How dare you say I plagiarized? This is plain slander!”noveldrama
Before anyone could react, she suddenly lunged at the staff member, shouting, “How dare you accuse me of such a thing? What evidence do you have?”
The man was unfazed, even in the face of Vivi’s furious questioning.
“Miss Quinn,” he replied calmly, “we are merely acting on a report we received. An investigation is still needed to verify the truth. In the meantime, we hope that you will cooperate as we go through the investigation.”
Garrett chose to speak up as well.
“Please calm down, Miss Quinn. We will uncover the truth and provide you with a fair response.”
Vivi noted his grave expression and grew even more panicked. She knew she couldn’t get out of this one easily.
“But—but…” Vivi tried to argue, only to be interrupted by Garrett.
“I’m afraid this is not the time to plead your case, Miss Quinn. To ensure fairness in the competition, we have decided to pause the event for thirty minutes as we investigate the matter.”
He paused to let his words sink in, then added, “Please accompany us backstage to assist with the investigation.”
Vivi tried to protest again, but two staff members had already appeared on either side of her.

“Miss Quinn, please come this way,” one of them said as they took hold of each of her arms.
Vivi had no choice but to follow them backstage.
As soon as she was out of sight, the venue descended into yet another round of chaos. This time, the discussions were louder and more frenzied.
Kyla stood below the stage, her expression dark. She couldn’t believe things had escalated to such a point.
Their plan had seemed seamless, but for some reason, Vivi was the one getting accused of plagiarism.
What bitter irony.
“Damn it! Just what on earth is going on?” Kyla nibbled on her thumb, unwilling to accept defeat.
She had invested so much in their plan and had even gone over every detail to make sure it was foolproof. How could it all fall apart before her eyes like this?
Kyla gritted her teeth. One way or another, she was going to find out who was behind this sabotage.
Sweat glistened on Garrett’s forehead, and his hands were damp.
He had never, not even in his worst nightmares, imagined that things would turn out like this. Despite strict instructions from his superiors to secure Vivi’s victory, everything had unraveled at this crucial moment.
“What now?”
Garrett felt a sinking certainty—he was in serious trouble.
He couldn’t afford to offend those in power, after all.
The other judges exchanged nervous glances, clearly caught off guard by the unexpected turn of events.

“Should we head backstage to investigate first?” one of the judges suggested hesitantly.
Garrett nodded briskly, “Good idea. Let’s investigate right away.” Without hesitation, they abandoned their seats and made their way behind the scenes.
Once there, they immediately started going through the documents.
However, the more they examined, the more their unease grew.
The evidence was undeniable.
The jewelry Vivi had created for Sirocco Group bore a striking resemblance to an old design draft released by Sadie’s studio. To make matters worse, Sadie’s team had previously issued an official statement, calling out the flaws in that very draft and making it clear that Sadie was the designer.
According to competition rules, any participant with a history of copying others’ work would be permanently barred from entering.
Garrett felt as if lightning had struck him.
If the plagiarism was confirmed, Vivi’s career would be over. Worse, he himself would be implicated.
He cleared his throat twice, straightened his posture, and spoke with a serious expression. “Everyone, we must proceed with great care. This concerns Miss Quinn’s standing as well as the credibility of this event.” Then, after a brief pause, his tone took on a calculated vagueness. “In my opinion, while there are certain similarities between these designs, it’s difficult to call it outright plagiarism. After all, creative minds can sometimes arrive at similar ideas.”
One judge frowned, seemingly about to challenge him, but in the end, he remained silent.

###Chapter 581:
Amy, however, couldn’t stay quiet any longer. Having mentored both Vivi and Sadie at different points, she could tell immediately—Vivi’s piece was nothing but a blatant imitation of Sadie’s.
“Enough!” Her expression hardened, and her voice was sharp as ice. “How long do you all plan to keep lying to yourselves? The truth is clear—Vivi copied Sadie’s work. That’s an indisputable fact.”
Without waiting for a response, she turned and strode into the lounge, where Vivi was waiting.
Looking at the student she had once placed so much faith in, Amy felt an overwhelming sense of disappointment.
“Vivi, be honest with me. Why did you do it?”
Vivi’s eyes turned red, as though she had suffered an unbearable injustice.
She bit her lower lip, her voice trembling. “I didn’t do it, Amy. I swear, I didn’t steal anyone’s design. Please believe me! You’ve always favored Sadie over me—can’t you support me just this once?”
Amy’s frown deepened, frustration evident in her gaze.
“Vivi, I have never been biased toward anyone. Design is built on integrity and honesty. No matter who it is, if they cross the line, they must take responsibility for their actions.” Her voice softened as she sighed.
“Listen to me—go and admit what you’ve done. If you wait until this explodes, things will only spiral out of control. Think carefully.”
With that, Amy turned and left, leaving behind an air of deep disappointment.
Vivi remained, her body trembling slightly. She had bitten her lip so hard that it was nearly bleeding.
Why?
Why should she admit it?

Sadie had simply played her cards better than expected.
Of course, it all made sense—Amy had always preferred Sadie from the very start.
As she stood there, consumed by her thoughts, Kyla entered with a confident stride.
As she took in Vivi’s distressed state, a cold smirk curled on Kyla’s lips.
“What’s with that face? Already falling apart?”
At her words, Vivi’s head snapped up.
Her stare was sharp—like a poisoned dagger aimed directly at Kyla. “You knew, didn’t you?”
Kyla flinched slightly under Vivi’s intense gaze but quickly masked it with a composed smile.
“How would I have known?” she replied smoothly. “If you want to blame someone, blame that snake, Nanette! She had the nerve to turn on us and join forces with that little fox, Sadie. What a treacherous backstabber!”
She patted Vivi’s shoulder lightly, her tone dark and laced with promise. “But don’t worry. Someone will make sure this situation is handled. That champion title will be yours—no matter what.”
One thing was certain—Kyla would never allow Sadie to take first place.
Meanwhile, Sadie made her way back to the lounge.
The moment she pushed the door open, she spotted Nanette standing there, guilt written all over her face, and her eyes were red as she stepped forward.
“Sadie… I’m sorry…”

###Chapter 582:
Hearing this, Sadie waved her hand dismissively, unbothered. “Forget it. Back then, you were only trying to save your mother. As for those with ill intentions, they’ll face the consequences sooner or later.”
Nanette seemed like she wanted to say more, but in the end, she held back.noveldrama
Sadie had barely settled into a seat when Amy entered the room.
Amy shot her a deep, searching look. Although her words were framed as a question, she was almost certain of the answer.
“Sadie, be honest. Could Vivi really have gotten access to your designs? Did you orchestrate everything and put out that statement ahead of time?”
Sadie didn’t respond.
Amy instantly understood. She sighed, her voice carrying a trace of resignation.
“Sadie, the design industry should be built on honesty and originality. I get it—maybe you had your reasons—but even so…”
She hesitated, stopping mid-sentence. The Sadie she once knew—the one whose passion for design burned brightly, whose eyes shone with nothing but enthusiasm—was no longer the same.
She had changed.
The old Sadie would work tirelessly, sacrificing sleep just for a spark of inspiration. But now…
Amy exhaled deeply.
There was no use saying more.
She looked at Sadie, disappointment flickering in her gaze.
In the end, she didn’t press further and simply turned to leave.
As the door clicked shut, Sadie lowered her eyes, a storm of emotions brewing within her.

She understood how Amy felt.
But some things were simply beyond her control.
Nanette, who had remained quiet all this time, slipped out of the room.
Perhaps Sadie needed some time alone.
The short break flew by.
Soon, it was time to head to the competition.
As Sadie stepped out, she accidentally bumped into a staff member.
“Miss Hudson, Mr. Schultz has requested to see you.”
A faint unease crept over her, but she followed the staff member anyway.
She was led to a quiet room.
Garrett was already seated on the sofa, as if he had been waiting for her.
He gestured toward the seat across from him, his tone courteous.
“Miss Hudson, please have a seat. I called you here to discuss something important.”
Sadie met his gaze, already forming a few suspicions.
“What is it?” she asked, her voice cool as she discreetly activated the recording feature on her phone.
Garrett leaned back slightly.
“Well, Miss Hudson, we all recognize your exceptional talent as a designer. However, this competition… the situation is rather delicate.”
Dropping all pretense, he got straight to the point.
.

.
###Chapter 583:
“We strongly advise you to acknowledge that your previous work was copied from Vivi’s design.”
A cold laugh escaped Sadie’s lips.
“So this is how the International Jewelry Design Competition operates? Throwing out baseless accusations?”
Garrett’s face darkened.noveldrama
By now, the other judges had already ruled Vivi guilty of plagiarism.
Sadie was the only one who could change the situation.
“Miss Hudson, there’s no need to be so agitated,” he said smoothly. “If you agree, I can arrange for you to receive a substantial sum—enough to ensure you live comfortably for the rest of your life.”
Although Garrett wasn’t particularly pleased with how things had unfolded, this was still preferable to jeopardizing his own position.
Sadie arched an eyebrow.
“Oh? So you’re telling me I have no choice but to confess to plagiarism?”
When Garrett saw her reluctance, his expression hardened, his tone laced with an unspoken threat.
“Miss Hudson, you’re an intelligent woman. You should understand what’s in your best interest. You’re up against forces far beyond your control. The person backing us isn’t someone you’d want to antagonize.”
Sadie narrowed her eyes slightly.
Garrett was clearly siding with Vivi, and Vivi had Kyla on her side.
But who was supporting them from behind the scenes?
A sudden realization struck her.
Find what’s next on g al no ve ls ;com
Her fingers curled into a fist.
Garrett mistook her silence for hesitation and decided to lay his cards on the table.
“There’s no harm in telling you,” he said, his voice low. “It’s Mr. Noah Wall. He’s already determined that Vivi will take home the championship. No matter what, the outcome won’t change. You’d do well not to fight against it.”
Sadie felt like the ground had disappeared beneath her feet.
Noah?
She should have seen this coming.
Garrett, unaware of her connection to Noah, assumed she was just another disposable piece in the game.
He took a leisurely sip of coffee, amusement flickering in his eyes.
“Well, Miss Hudson, have you made your decision?”
Sadie let out a sharp, derisive laugh.
She lifted her head, her gaze cold, filled with mockery.
“I recorded every word you just said. This will go straight to the authorities. And if this is the kind of corruption the International Jewelry Design Competition runs on, then I want nothing to do with it.”
With that, she pressed a button on her phone, withdrawing from the competition.
Then she made sure the recording was saved in several different emails.
Garrett’s face drained of color.
His entire body trembled. He had never expected Sadie to record him. If that recording got out, not only would he lose Noah’s favor, but his entire career would come crashing down.
.

###Chapter 584:
Garrett’s breath hitched, perspiration streaming down his temples. His entire body quivered as he collapsed to his knees before Sadie, his sobs raw and desperate.
“Miss Hudson, you can’t do this to me!” he choked out, his voice strained. “I have people relying on me—my entire household depends on my support. I’m begging you, erase that recording! Please, I’m pleading with you!”
Sadie’s expression remained impassive as she recoiled from his grasp, revulsion curling in her chest.
“Actions have consequences.”
Her voice was devoid of sympathy as she turned, preparing to leave. Garrett’s heart pounded as the futility of his pleas sank in, his features contorting into something dark.
This wretched woman!
If she was determined to push him into a corner, she had no right to protest when he fought back.
His gaze darted to a towering metal sculpture nearby, standing like a sentinel.
Without a moment’s hesitation, he seized it and swung with all the force he could muster.
“You bitch! Go to hell!” he bellowed, his bloodshot eyes blazing with fury.
The sharp movement caught Sadie’s attention, her pupils constricting.
Her thoughts went blank—there was no escape.
She was done for.
Just as the sculpture was about to connect, a figure lunged in front of her. “Bang!”
A sickening thud echoed through the room as Alex’s head bore the brunt of the impact. Crimson spattered across his face.
“Alex!” Sadie shrieked, her voice laced with panic.
  ? .
Garrett stiffened, horror flashing across his face.
His fingers loosened, the sculpture slipping from his grip and crashing to the floor.
How was this even possible?
This woman had been fortunate enough to have someone shield her at the last second.
Now, he was truly doomed—this had spiraled into something far worse than he had anticipated.
Fear gripped his chest, and Garrett staggered backward before turning on his heel and bolting from the scene.
Sadie didn’t bother pursuing him.
Her attention was solely on Alex, whose body swayed unsteadily. Hands trembling, she reached out to steady him.
“Alex, talk to me! Don’t scare me!” she cried, her voice quivering.
“I’m fine,” Alex mumbled, though the crimson streaks running down his face told a different story.
He attempted a reassuring smile, but it only came off as a pained grimace.noveldrama
“Fine? You’re bleeding so much!” Sadie’s voice cracked as she frantically rummaged through her bag, pulling out tissues in a futile attempt to staunch the bleeding. The crimson kept flowing.
Panic swelled in her chest as she fumbled for her phone. Her fingers barely functioned as she dialed.
.

.
###Chapter 585:
“Nanette! Get medical personnel here immediately! And call the authorities—someone’s been injured!”
Hearing the urgency in Sadie’s tone, Nanette wasted no time, immediately setting things in motion.
Given the nature of the event, a medical team was on standby.
Within minutes, paramedics stormed in with a stretcher.
“Clear the way!” they called out, efficiently lifting Alex onto it. The pristine sheet beneath him darkened with red, the sight twisting a knife in Sadie’s heart.
After a brief assessment, a doctor made a quick decision.
“The injury is severe. We need to transport him to the hospital at once,”
“Do it,” Sadie said without hesitation.
The medics sprang into action, swiftly organizing a group of strong young men to carry the stretcher out of the venue.
“Stay with me, Alex! You’re going to be alright,” Sadie trailed after them, her emotions barely contained. Alex’s consciousness was slipping.
His eyelids fluttered as he struggled to stay alert. His lips parted, voice barely above a whisper.
“Sa… Sadie… don’t… don’t worry… focus on what you need to do.”noveldrama
His words were disjointed, yet his meaning was clear. “I’ll… be fine…” Then, as if he had gathered the last of his strength, his voice rang out with surprising clarity. “Stan!”
A broad-shouldered man rushed forward. “Yes, Mr. Howe.”
“Ensure… Miss Hudson’s safety,” Alex commanded before his body went completely limp.
Sadie’s fingers curled into fists, a storm brewing in her eyes.
Exclusive updates available at g?lnσνe?s?c?m
This was far from over. She would see justice served.
As the ambulance sped away, sirens wailing, the venue slowly returned to a semblance of normalcy.
Garrett, still visibly shaken, wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. Steeling himself, he forced his way back onto the stage.
Gripping the microphone tightly, he cleared his throat, though his voice wavered.
“There was a minor disruption just now… but we will now proceed with the results announcement.” He rushed through his words as if desperate to escape.
“The panel has reached a unanimous verdict. The winner of this contest is… Miss Vivi Quinn. Regarding the plagiarism allegation, an investigation has confirmed that Miss Sadie Hudson copied Miss Quinn’s work. Vivi’s creation is entirely her own.”
He blurted out the decision, as though lingering even a second longer would shatter what little composure he had left.
A stunned hush fell over the audience before erupting into murmurs of disbelief.
“What? Sadie plagiarized? That’s ridiculous!”
“Sadie’s designs are one of a kind. How could she possibly have stolen someone else’s work?”
“Exactly! She even withdrew from the competition earlier—something’s fishy.”
“Yeah, this doesn’t add up…”
“Hold it right there!” A sharp, unyielding voice sliced through the noise. It was Sadie.
.
.
.
###Chapter 586:
She strode toward the stage, her movements measured, her demeanor unshaken.
The color drained from Garrett’s face as though he had seen an apparition. He nearly stumbled backward.
“You—how… How are you here already?” His voice barely held together.
Sadie’s gaze was frigid, her lips curling into a slow, dangerous smile.
“You didn’t think I’d leave before setting the record straight, did you?” Without another word, she retrieved her phone and pressed play.
A voice, unmistakably belonging to Garrett, echoed through the speaker. “It’s Mr. Noah Wall. He’s already determined that Vivi will take home the championship…”
Garrett’s composure shattered. “No! Lies! It’s all fabricated!”
In his desperation, he lunged forward, reaching for the phone, but Sadie sidestepped him effortlessly. He lost his balance, toppling off the stage in an ungraceful heap.
The room fell silent. Then, chaos erupted.
“Oh my God! So it was rigged all along!”
“Noah Wall from Wall Group? This is a massive scandal!”
“Sadie was framed! She never plagiarized!”
“This is disgraceful for the entire design industry!”
Reporters went wild, cameras flashing.
They had just struck gold—this was the biggest expose of the year.
The headlines would be explosive.
Amid the commotion, Nanette quietly reentered the hall, flanked by uniformed officers.
The lead officer stepped forward.noveldrama
Find what’s next on g al no ve ls ;com
“Who is Garrett Schultz?” His tone was authoritative. The crowd eagerly pointed toward the cowering man.
Garrett opened his mouth, but no words came out.
The officers wasted no time. Handcuffs clicked into place. “We have received a report of assault. You’re coming with us.”
Panic consumed Garrett.
“No! I don’t want to go to jail!” he screamed, struggling desperately, but resistance was useless.
His cries dwindled as he was hauled out, leaving behind an audience still reeling from the spectacle.
Once Garrett was taken away by the police, the remaining panel of judges found themselves in a tough spot.
At last, an older judge with silver-streaked hair hesitantly announced the verdict.
Vivi was permanently barred from the competition.
Sadie was declared the champion.
Yet, triumph felt hollow.
She had secured the win, but at the cost of Alex’s injury.
Turning to Stan, concern evident in her voice, she urged, “Go to the hospital and look after him. I’ll get changed and join you soon. Don’t worry, everything’s settled now, and I’ll be safe.”
Though reluctant, Stan was more worried about his employer. “Miss Hudson, stay alert. Call me if anything happens—I’ll come right away.”

###Chapter 587:
Gritting his teeth, he left.
Wasting no time, Sadie hurried to the changing room.
Just as she finished, Vivi barged in, fury radiating from her.
“Sadie, you bitch!” Vivi hissed, her hand raised to strike.
But Sadie wasn’t about to let her.
She dodged effortlessly and responded with a slap of her own. “What’s wrong with you, Vivi?”
Stunned, Vivi clutched her cheek, her glare burning into Sadie. “Did you just hit me?”
Sadie smirked, her irritation giving way to amusement. “You took the first swing. I just thought you should experience what it’s like.” Without hesitation, she struck again—this time, with full force.
Vivi’s head snapped to the side, leaving her momentarily dazed.
As Sadie lowered her hand, her gaze remained sharp.
“The first was for breaking the rules. The second—for the humiliation you put me through.”
Vivi snapped out of her shock, fury flashing in her eyes. “Don’t think too highly of yourself, Sadie. You may have won, but that doesn’t make you better than me.”
Leaning in, Vivi whispered smugly, “You know what? A little charm was all it took to get Noah to hand me the championship.”
Sadie arched a brow, her voice dripping with mockery. “Is that so? If Noah treasures you so much, why hasn’t he brought you to his side? Face it, Vivi—you’re nothing special.”
Sadie’s words hit a raw nerve.
While others might have been unaware, Vivi knew the truth—Noah had never spared her a second thought.
  ? .
Sadie recognized the silence for what it was—a direct hit.
Smiling faintly, she brushed past Vivi and walked away.
“Sadie, you’ll regret this! Just you wait!” Vivi shouted after her. Yet, the sting from those two slaps kept her from following.noveldrama
Just then, her phone buzzed.
Irritated, she snatched it up.
“Hello, Dad…”
“Vivi! You disgrace! Look at the mess you’ve made! Because of you, our family became a laughingstock! Get home immediately!” Moses bellowed before cutting the call.
Vivi’s hands trembled, her voice failing her.
It was all because of Sadie. One day, she’d make her pay.
Meanwhile, Sadie had reached the parking lot, with Nanette trailing behind her in silence.
Just as she was about to enter the car, a familiar figure approached—it was Kyla.
Nanette stiffened, instinctively lowering her gaze.
Kyla sauntered past, hips swaying, and halted before Sadie.
She smirked, her voice laced with contempt.
“Don’t fool yourself, Sadie. Beating Vivi doesn’t mean you’ve actually won. Your little tricks don’t impress me.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 588:
Sadie had no patience for Kyla’s games.
She glanced at her briefly, lips curling into a faint, taunting smile.
“Oh?” was all she said.
Kyla mistook her silence for fear and leaned in. “Here’s some advice—don’t get ahead of yourself. Noah doesn’t care about you anymore. Got it?”
With that, she turned on her heel, purposefully brushing past Nanette as she walked away.
Nanette’s footing faltered, but Sadie was quick to steady her.
“Nanette, are you okay?” she asked, concern lacing her voice.
Nanette gave a shaky nod, though the tremor in her hands betrayed her.
Kyla halted mid-stride, turning back with a glacial glare. Her voice was razor-sharp, each word laced with venom.
“Enjoy this moment, Nanette. Soon enough, you’ll understand what it means to cross me.”
Nanette stood frozen, her mind spiraling. The weight of Kyla’s threat coiled around her like a vice.
By the time she slid into the car, her strength gave out. She sank into the seat, her breath unsteady.
Kyla had never been one for empty threats—how far would she go this time?
No matter what, she had to keep Sadie out of this.
Sensing the tension radiating off her friend, Sadie spoke softly.
“I’ve arranged for a general practitioner from abroad to see your mother. If everything went smoothly, he should be with your mother right now.”
Nanette’s head snapped up, her eyes widening. “Sadie…”
  ? .
Nanette barely got the name out before Sadie reached into her bag and pulled out a check.
“Two hundred thousand. Use it to clear your debts,” Sadie said, her tone firm yet gentle. “I’m giving you tomorrow off—take the time to set things right at home.”
Nanette’s chest tightened. What had she done to deserve such generosity?
She quickly shook her head. “Sadie, I can’t take this.”
But Sadie wouldn’t hear it. She pressed the check into Nanette’s trembling hand.
“Take it,” she insisted. “And if it’s not enough, tell me.”
Nanette’s composure crumbled. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks as she clutched the check, her voice thick with emotion. “Thank you, Sadie. I swear, I’ll pay you back—no matter what it takes.”
Sadie exhaled, long and deep, but said nothing more.
Nanette had wronged her. That much was undeniable. But Sadie understood—Kyla had backed Nanette into a corner, using her mother’s life as leverage. And in the end, Nanette had chosen the right side.
Without her last-minute defiance, Sadie might have been the one disgraced, falsely accused of plagiarism, her career in ruins.
The car slowed to a stop in front of the hospital. Sadie instructed the driver to take Nanette home first, then come back for her.
“Understood, madam,” the driver responded with a respectful nod.
As the car pulled away, Sadie turned toward the hospital entrance. She moved with quiet determination, stopping only to ask a nurse for directions. The room wasn’t hard to find.

###Chapter 589:
The door was slightly ajar. She hesitated for a brief moment before gently pushing it open and stepping inside.
Alex lay in bed, his head wrapped in fresh bandages. A doctor stood beside him, speaking in a calm, measured tone.
“The wound was properly bandaged, but keep it dry and avoid any strenuous activity. It’s best to stay overnight for observation—just in case of a concussion. Rest is crucial, and if you feel any discomfort, press the call button immediately.”
Alex gave a small nod. “Thank you, doctor.”
The doctor returned the nod, then exited the room, shutting the door behind him.
Now, it was just the two of them. Alex’s gaze shifted to Sadie, and surprise flickered in his eyes. He struggled to sit up, wincing at the effort.
“Sadie? What are you doing here? You don’t have to worry—I’m fine.” He hissed, his breath hitching.
Sadie was at his side in an instant, pressing a gentle hand on his shoulder, helping him lie back down. A pang of guilt settled in her chest. She lowered her voice, her tone tinged with both concern and frustration.
“Next time, don’t be so reckless. When there’s danger, you have to think about protecting yourself first.”
Alex met her gaze, his eyes gentle yet unwavering.
He parted his lips as if to speak but hesitated, swallowing back whatever was on his mind. A long pause stretched between them before he finally said, his voice barely above a whisper, “I won’t let anything happen to you.”
Something about the way he said it unsettled Sadie, a warmth laced with an unspoken promise. Not wanting to dwell on it, she quickly redirected the conversation. “Where’s Stan?”
Alex’s expression darkened, his gaze drifting downward.
“I sent him back to the company. There were a few things that needed handling,” he said, his voice quieter now. Sadie studied him, her concern deepening.

“You should stay overnight. The doctor was clear—no unnecessary movement. Someone should be here with you.”
Alex simply shrugged, dismissing the worry with a half-hearted smile. “I’m not a kid, Sadie. I can manage.” His attempt at reassurance was thin at best. “Worst case, I’ll hit the call button and have a nurse fuss over me. Sadie, don’t lose sleep over me. Just go home and rest.”
Sadie couldn’t shake the unease gnawing at her. The thought of leaving Alex alone in this condition felt impossible. “No way, I’ll have Jim help me hire a caregiver for you!”
Alex opened his mouth to argue, but before he could get a word out, Sadie had already pulled out her phone, her fingers moving with determined urgency as she dialed Jim’s number.
As the call rang, Alex watched her, a quiet warmth stirring in his chest. She still cared.
Jim, being the head doctor, should have had no trouble finding someone reliable to stay with him. But the seconds dragged on, stretching into a minute, then longer. No answer.
Sadie slowly lowered her phone, a crease forming between her brows. She was torn. Leaving Alex alone in this state didn’t sit right with her. “Maybe I should stay. What do you think?” Sadie’s voice carried a hint of hesitation.
Alex’s eyes lit up instantly, though he was quick to school his expression into something more neutral.

###Chapter 590:
“That’s really not necessary,” he said, keeping his tone casual. “You’ve got a lot on your plate already. And Averi still needs you.”
“I’ll manage. I can finish my work tomorrow, and Carol can look after Averi for the night.” She crossed her arms, her decision final. “So that’s that.”
A warmth spread through Alex’s chest at her unwavering stance, though he played it off with a resigned sigh. “Well, if you’re that determined… I guess I’ll have to trouble you then.”
Sadie didn’t waste another second. She pulled out her phone and tapped out a message to her driver.
“No need to pick me up. I’m staying at the hospital tonight.”
With that settled, she pocketed her phone and immediately busied herself, checking the room, adjusting Alex’s blanket—doing anything to make herself useful.
At the Quinn family’s villa, the moment Vivi stepped through the grand entrance, a blur of motion shot toward her. Instinct took over. She twisted to the side just in time.
CRASH! A cup shattered against the floor, jagged shards skidding across the polished marble at her feet.
Moses stood rigid, his face red with fury, his finger trembling as he pointed at her. “You’ve got a lot of nerve walking back into this house!” he bellowed. “Plagiarism? Do you have any idea what you’ve done? You’ve disgraced our family—dragged our name through the filth!”
“Dad, I—I swear, I didn’t!” Vivi said, her voice barely above a whisper.
“Still lying?” Moses’s voice rose to a roar, his eyes ablaze with fury. “The entire internet is flooded with your scandal! Do you have any idea the humiliation I’ve suffered? How am I supposed to explain this to the Olson family?”
Vivi went still. The mention of the Olson family sent a chill crawling up her spine.

“Dad, I told you—I’m not marrying Anson!”
Moses’s rage ignited like dry tinder. “You think you have a say in this?” His voice cut like a whip. “You’ll do as you’re told!”
The shrill sound of his phone slashed through the air before he could finish.
Moses inhaled sharply, his fury momentarily caged. He glanced at the screen—Damian.
His posture stiffened. A flicker of unease passed over his face before he forced on a fake smile and pressed the phone to his ear. “Hey, Damian! My dear friend!”noveldrama
“Moses, I’ve heard about Vivi’s… situation,” Damian said, his words laced with quiet authority.
Moses swallowed, a bead of sweat forming at his temple. He had no choice but to push forward. “Damian, this is nothing but a misunderstanding! You know Vivi’s talent—she would never plagiarize. Someone is clearly trying to bring her down!”
A low chuckle crackled through the receiver.
“Whether it’s true or not is irrelevant now.” Damian’s voice was cool, detached. “My family cannot accept a granddaughter-in-law with a scandal-ridden reputation. Moses, don’t take this personally, but if Vivi’s name isn’t cleared, consider the engagement off.”
Moses felt a jolt of panic, cold sweat breaking out along his forehead.
With Vivi’s situation as it was, any hope of securing a marriage with Noah was already lost. The Quinn family’s ambitions, their future, all hinged on this connection to the Olsons now. Without it, their social standing would plummet.
Desperate, he rushed to placate Damian.

###Chapter 591:
“Damnian, you’re absolutely right,” he said hastily. “But don’t worry—I’ll handle this. I’ll make sure everything is resolved.”
A heavy silence lingered on the other end of the line before Damian finally spoke again, his tone shifting. “I hear the international film star Zoe Travis is returning to the country for her wedding. Vivi’s mentor, Amy, happens to be a close friend of hers. You’d be wise to seize this opportunity.”
Moses’s mind clicked into gear, his anxiety momentarily replaced by a spark of hope. Zoe’s wedding was a golden opportunity. If Amy could be persuaded to recommend Vivi as the designer for Zoe’s wedding jewelry, it could be the lifeline they needed.noveldrama
A high-profile endorsement from Zoe would be enough to erase the scandal. Even if Zoe didn’t speak on Vivi’s behalf, simply having her jewelry featured at the wedding would give them the leverage to rebuild Vivi’s shattered reputation.
Moses’s voice grew animated as the realization set in. “Damian, rest assured—I’ll make sure Vivi gets this project!”
As soon as he ended the call, he turned to Vivi, his expression a volatile mix of frustration and expectation.
“You heard everything, didn’t you?” His voice cut through the air like a blade, heavy with expectation. “No excuses. Do whatever it takes to secure this project!”
A tight knot formed in Vivi’s stomach. Amy, her mentor—the one who had always favored Sadie. What were the odds Amy would entrust something so significant to her instead?
For a fleeting second, doubt flickered in her eyes. But defiance wasn’t an option. She pressed her lips together, forcing down the wave of unease rising in her chest. “…I understand, Dad.”
Moses studied her for a beat, then exhaled, his rigid stance easing ever so slightly.
“And one more thing—” Moses’s voice was firm, leaving no room for argument. “Even if you refuse to marry Anson, you must keep the Olson family on our side. Once the partnership agreement is in place, we’ll handle everything else.”

Vivi tightened her fists at her sides. She bit her lip harder but, in the end, she could only nod.
Without another word, she turned and retreated to her room, her body heavy with exhaustion. Amy? How was she supposed to face her now? But… this project was her only way forward.
Taking a steadying breath, she finally pressed the dial button. The call rang for what felt like an eternity before a weary voice finally answered.
“Hello, Amy.” Vivi swallowed, her voice barely steady. “It’s me, Vivi.”
A brief pause. Then, Amy sighed. “Vivi? It’s late. What do you want?” Her tone was distant. Cold. Vivi’s teeth clenched. But this wasn’t the time for pride. She forced herself to stay composed.
“Amy…” She hesitated, then drew a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I know I was wrong.”
Silence. A long, weighted silence. Then, at last, Amy spoke, her voice carrying an unmistakable trace of relief.
“Vivi, it’s good that you realize your mistake. The path of design leaves no room for dishonesty. Once you lose your integrity, it’s hard to find your way back.”
Vivi’s fingers curled into the bedsheet, resentment simmering beneath her calm exterior. Amy was still siding with Sadie. But she had no choice but to play along. Her tone remained measured, respectful.
“Amy, I hear you. I won’t repeat my mistakes—I give you my word.” Before the conversation could linger on uncomfortable truths, Vivi smoothly changed the subject.

###Chapter 592:
“By the way, when do you leave? I’d really like to take you out for a meal… as a proper apology. Face to face.”
A beat of silence followed, heavy with unspoken thoughts. Amy’s hesitation was almost palpable. Then, at last, she answered, “My flight’s tomorrow afternoon. If you’re truly sincere about apologizing, meet me at Sawnard Estate. I’ll be waiting.”
Vivi exhaled, steadying herself, willing her voice to remain even.
“Understood, Amy. I’ll see you there.”
After spending the night under close observation, Alex was finally allowed to leave the hospital. Sadie sighed with relief, then left the room and headed straight for the discharge desk.
Meanwhile, Alex stood in front of the mirror, adjusting his collar again and again. He twisted his lips, attempting to craft a charming smile. Still unsatisfied, he shifted his stance and inspected his reflection more intently.
“It looks a bit stiff,” he muttered, trying out a few more smiles. “Forget it, it’ll have to do.”
After all, appearances never mattered much to Sadie.noveldrama
Just as he reached this conclusion, the hospital room door swung open. Alex spun around, his smile freezing when he saw the visitor.
“Stan? What are you doing here? Where’s Sadie?” Stan hovered awkwardly in the doorway.
“Mr. Howe, Miss Hudson had to leave suddenly after a phone call. She asked me to drive you home.”
“What?” Alex’s tone spiked with disbelief. “Where did she go? Did she say when she’ll be back?”
Stan, caught off guard by the questions, stuttered, “I—I’m not sure, Mr. Howe. I just ran into Miss Hudson in the lobby. She didn’t mention anything else.”
Alex felt frustrated. Of course, Stan had to appear at this inconvenient time. And as luck would have it, he ran into Sadie. His well-laid plans were now in ruins. He had hoped to take Sadie out for a meal after she finished the discharge formalities.

But now…
Defeated, Alex slumped back into a chair and gestured feebly. “Let’s go.”
Stan, sensing Alex’s disappointment, hastened to assist him out of the room without another word. Throughout the drive, Alex remained silent, staring somberly out the car window, his expression a blend of bitterness and melancholy.
Meanwhile, Sadie was en route to Sawnard Estate.
Just earlier, Gabriel, Nigel’s butler, had called to tell her that Nigel had just returned from abroad and wished to see her.
An hour later, led by a server, she entered a lavishly decorated private room.
“Nigel,” she said.
Since she married into the Wall family, Nigel had been the sole member to show her kindness. Nigel was seated in a redwood chair carved with intricate designs, looking pale and visibly tired.
“Sadie, you’re here,” Nigel greeted her softly.
“How are you feeling?” Sadie asked, her concern evident as she sat next to him.
“Just the usual, nothing serious,” Nigel replied, waving his hand dismissively.
He then motioned to Gabriel. “Bring it over.”
Gabriel nodded and passed a document to Sadie.
“What’s this?” she inquired, taking the file.
.

.
###Chapter 593:
“A stock transfer agreement,” Nigel explained calmly. “It’s your grandfather’s share. It’s time it went back to its rightful owner.”
As Sadie opened the file, her eyes were immediately drawn to the words “Effective Immediately” and the bright red seal. Her head snapped up, eyes shimmering with tears.
“Nigel…” she murmured, her voice thick with emotion.
“This is your due,” Nigel said, patting her hand gently. “I’ve never forgotten your grandfather’s contributions to the Wall Group.” Nigel paused, as if remembering something else. “Also, Sadie, my goddaughter Zoe is getting married soon. I’d like you to design the jewelry. The wedding planner will be here shortly to discuss details.”
Sadie, taken aback, blinked. She had never met this goddaughter before.
As she mulled over this, the door opened again.
A server ushered in a woman.
“Amy?” Sadie gasped, astonished.
Amy paused, equally surprised. But then, it all made sense to her.
Nigel, observing the interaction, smiled broadly.
Amy looked at Sadie, hesitant to speak.
A sharp pang of guilt struck Sadie. Over the three years they had known each other, she had never opened up about her personal life to Amy.
“Amy, I’m sorry I’ve kept this a secret all this time,” Sadie said, her voice heavy with regret.
Amy sighed, her face showing her inner conflict.
“To be honest, I had my suspicions before coming here. Nigel mentioned that his granddaughter-in-law was a remarkably talented designer. Now it all makes sense that it’s you.”
Your storytelling destination is gα?ησν?s?com
Sadie bit her lip, her guilt intensifying. It wasn’t just her secret troubling her—she was also concerned that Amy might feel she had leveraged her connections unfairly. The jewelry design competition she had participated in was still fresh in her mind.
Amy sensed Sadie’s unease and reassuringly patted her hand. “There’s no need to worry. Your talent stands on its own. I’ve seen your work at the international competition. It was outstanding.”
Encouraged by Amy’s words, Sadie looked up, thankful.
“Thank you, Amy.”
Amy offered a warm smile. “Let’s not dwell on the past. One of my main reasons for coming to Jazmah was to oversee the jewelry design for Zoe’s wedding. Nigel recommended you, and I completely agree with his choice.”
Effectively, Amy would have chosen Sadie regardless of Nigel’s input. Sadie was slightly confused.
“Yes, Zoe Travis—the internationally acclaimed actress. Her wedding will be a high-profile event, and there are enormous expectations for the jewelry. Nigel considers this project very important.”
Sadie nodded, her interest in the renowned Zoe piqued.
Amy pulled a folder from her bag and handed it to Sadie.
“This has all the details for Zoe’s wedding. Review it thoroughly and feel free to share your ideas with me.”
Taking the folder, Sadie began to examine its contents closely.

###Chapter 594:
“I hope you approach this design with the utmost seriousness, as it represents Nigel’s trust in you.”
“I understand, Amy. I’ll do my best,” Sadie assured her earnestly.
Amy nodded in approval. “I trust you will.”
They continued discussing details until Sadie had all the information she needed. Then, she rose to leave. “Amy, I’ll take my leave now.”noveldrama
“Alright, take care.”
Sadie left the private room and the building.
Just after her departure, Vivi arrived, pausing nervously outside the door to collect her thoughts. Since the plagiarism scandal, her studio’s clients had either demanded refunds or canceled their orders. For someone as proud as Vivi, the blow to her reputation was intolerable. Zoe was her chance at redemption.
Determined to secure the opportunity today, she abruptly opened the door. She walked directly to Amy and gave a slight bow.
“Amy, I apologize for my lateness. I acted impulsively before, and I hope you can overlook that.”
Amy offered her a cool glance, clearly not interested in dredging up the past. “Take a seat.”
Vivi sat, her demeanor subdued.
As Amy perused the menu, Vivi said, “I heard Nigel has entrusted you with Zoe’s wedding jewelry design?”
Amy looked up, her expression unreadable. She knew Vivi well enough to sense the ulterior motive behind her words. So the apology was just a facade—this was Vivi’s true intent. Amy closed the menu, her disappointment palpable, and the mood soured instantly.
Vivi felt the intensity of Amy’s stare, her own nails pressing into her palms, but she maintained a polite smile. “Amy, despite my past errors, I’m sincere about starting anew.”
She reached out for Amy’s hand, her gesture one of desperation. “Amy, I’m your student too. It’s unfair to treat us so differently! I can’t be excluded from the design community!”

Amy stood and withdrew her hand.
In that moment, realization dawned on Vivi.
Tears sprang to her eyes, disbelief etching her features. She had humbled herself so deeply—how could Amy remain indifferent?
“Vivi, you’re undeniably talented, but your temperament and character…”
Amy shook her head, choosing not to continue.
The implication of her words was unmistakable.
Her disappointment in her once-promising student was irreparable.
“Vivi, some things are hard to change. You need time, reflection, and personal growth. I’ve entrusted Zoe’s design project to Sadie. Focus on improving yourself, and once you’ve truly changed, I’ll be here to support you.”
It was always Sadie. That bitch.
Vivi’s facade crumbled, revealing a look of raw jealousy.
“Why, Amy? Why do you only help her? What makes her better than me? Why does she deserve everything?”
Vivi’s anger escalated dangerously.
In a rash act, she grabbed a nearby ashtray and hurled it at Amy.
.
.
.
###Chapter 595:
“Are you insane?” Amy exclaimed, but she couldn’t move away in time.
Bang! The ashtray struck Amy, and blood began to flow from a wound on her head.
Bang! Another loud crash echoed as Amy collapsed to the floor.
Reality hit Vivi hard.
She knelt down, her hands trembling as she checked Amy’s pulse.
And Vivi realized the gravity of what had happened… Amy was no longer breathing.
In a state of panic, Vivi screamed and dashed from the room.
As she exited, she collided with a waitress carrying a tray of food.
The waitress stood frozen, her eyes shifting between Vivi’s bloody hands and Amy’s motionless body.
The tray clattered to the floor.
Vivi panicked. She had to keep this secret at all costs.
The thought of prison terrified her.
Checking to ensure they were alone, Vivi pulled the waitress into the room, her hands tightening around the woman’s neck as she glared menacingly.
“You saw nothing! Speak of this, and I’ll come after you and your family!”
The waitress, struggling for air, nodded frantically, overwhelmed by fear.
This exclusive restaurant was only for the wealthy and influential. She was merely a waitress. How could she confront someone so formidable?
Vivi slowly regained her composure, her mind working furiously for a way out.
She relaxed her grip, her eyes turning cold and calculating.
Since Amy favored Sadie so much, Vivi decided she would let Sadie join Amy.

“If you follow my instructions, I’ll give you a sum of money and ensure your and your family’s safety,” she promised darkly.
The waitress, desperate and swayed by the offer, nodded her agreement.
Unbeknownst to Sadie, she was now in danger.
Upon her return to Myrtlewood Estate, she immediately felt something was amiss.
The servants lined the hallway silently, their eyes averted, as if under a spell.
Even Samuel, usually so vibrant, appeared subdued, offering only a weak smile that seemed to wish her good fortune.
Sadie’s heart sank.
Noah must have returned from his trip.
Entering the living room, she found Noah sitting on the sofa, his demeanor stormy.
He looked up, his voice icy, and said, “Where were you last night?”
Anger surged within Sadie, the memories of the previous day vivid in her mind.
If not for Alex, she might have been the one in the hospital.
She scoffed coldly.
“Why don’t you ask Vivi that question?” she challenged. Then she added with a pointed tone, “Or perhaps you should ask Garrett, the chief judge of the International Jewelry Design Competition?”noveldrama
Confusion flickered across Noah’s face.
“If you care so much about Vivi and decided she would win the competition, why keep me around? Why not just finalize the divorce? I’m more than willing to step aside for her.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 596:
Sadie often found Noah incomprehensible.
He had initiated the talk of divorce, yet balked when she agreed.
Noah’s face darkened further. He was clearly puzzled by her insinuations.
Tired of the games, Sadie turned and walked upstairs, leaving the conversation behind.
“Samuel! Get in here!” Noah bellowed.
With a heavy heart, Samuel entered the living room, his gaze downcast.
“Mr. Wall, what do you need?” Samuel asked, his tone polite but attentive.
“Find out what happened during the International Jewelry Design Competition!” Noah ordered, his voice firm.
Without hesitation, Samuel set to work, quickly gathering the necessary details. When he returned, he reported back to Noah, his expression grave.
Upon hearing the full account, Noah’s anger flared. “Unbelievable! This was Kyla’s doing!” he exclaimed, his frustration mounting. He had only agreed to Kyla’s request to let Vivi win the competition—after all, it was just a title. But he hadn’t known that Sadie was competing too.
“No! Tell Kyla to leave this city within three days!” Noah’s command was clear, and Samuel wasted no time, immediately heading out with two black-suited bodyguards.
When Kyla opened the door and saw Samuel standing with the bodyguards, her initial shock quickly shifted to a smug sense of pleasure. “Samuel, did Noah send you?” she asked, her voice dripping with anticipation.
However, her excitement quickly deflated as Samuel spoke with cold formality. “Miss Wade, Mr. Wall has ordered you to leave Jazmah.”
Kyla’s smile faltered, then vanished completely. “Why?” she demanded, her voice tinged with confusion.
Get lost in stories on g?lnσνs﹒
Samuel’s face remained impassive. “I am not privy to Mr. Wall’s reasons. Please make the necessary arrangements.”
“I’m not going anywhere!” Kyla snapped, her anger rising. “I need to speak with Noah directly!”
As she attempted to push past Samuel, the bodyguards moved swiftly to block her path.
“Miss Wade, Mr. Wall will not meet with you. He has been more than clear. Your departure is a leniency you should appreciate,” Samuel stated, his voice unwavering. He knew that Noah had reached his limit with Kyla’s behavior.
“I saved him! He promised to look after me forever!” Kyla’s voice was desperate, her hands trembling as she faced the reality of the situation.
Kyla was hysterical, tears streaming down her face.
“Miss Wade, please maintain some dignity,” Samuel said, unshaken. “If you persist, we will have to take stronger actions.”
Suddenly, a thought struck Kyla, and she began yelling in desperation.noveldrama
She couldn’t leave Jazmah. She couldn’t let that detestable Sadie win!
“I need to see Isabel! I must see her!” she cried out.
Samuel’s patience began to thin. “Miss Wade, you’re wasting time.” He turned to the bodyguards and ordered, “Gather Miss Wade’s things and escort her out of Jazmah.”
The bodyguards immediately set to work, handling Kyla’s possessions roughly.
Kyla stood there, powerless, as her items were shoved into suitcases. A mix of despair and fury filled her, her hands trembling at the helplessness of the situation.

###Chapter 597:
Soon, everything was packed.
Samuel motioned toward the exit. “Please, Miss Wade.”
Kyla resisted.
In desperation, she blurted out, “I need to use the bathroom.”
It was an urgent call of nature.
Samuel paused but ultimately consented. “Very well, but be quick.”
Kyla lowered her head, concealing the scheming look in her eyes. She walked slowly to the bathroom and locked the door behind her.
Time passed, and Kyla didn’t come out.
Feeling uneasy, Samuel knocked on the door. “Miss Wade?”
Silence.
Something was amiss.
He forced the door open to find the window wide open.
Kyla had fled.
“Damn it!” Samuel cursed softly.
“Start a search! Lock down the area and find her!” By then, Kyla had already left the neighborhood. She flagged down a taxi and instructed the driver to head to the Quinn family’s villa. It was her only option now; she would figure out the next steps once there.
Upon arriving at the Quinn family’s villa, Kyla paid the driver and nearly twisted her ankle as she got out of the car. She steadied herself using the car door and looked up to see Vivi sneaking around, clearly involved in something secretive.
“Vivi? What are you up to?” Kyla inquired.
Caught off guard, Vivi quickly hid her hands and averted her gaze. “Why are you here?”

Kyla’s suspicion intensified, but she held it back. She needed Vivi’s assistance.
“I need a place to stay for a bit.”noveldrama
Vivi snorted, as if amused. “Aren’t you staying at Noah’s place? What, did he kick you out?”
She scanned Kyla from head to toe, her gaze dripping with derision.
“And looking so disheveled,” she added.
Kyla’s face flushed with anger.
“Noah is just temporarily enchanted by that temptress Sadie! He’ll realize his mistake and take me back!”
Vivi felt a twinge of satisfaction seeing Kyla flustered, but she remained silent. She then motioned toward the door.
“Come in.”
Kyla caught the sneer in Vivi’s eyes but swallowed her pride. Realizing now was not the time to confront Vivi, she clenched her teeth and entered the villa.
Vivi wasn’t faring much better herself.
As they stepped into the living room, they overheard Moses’s obsequious tone.
“Don’t worry, Anson, I’ll ensure she’s ready for you.” It was clear who “she” was.
Vivi pressed her lips together, choosing to remain silent.
Meanwhile, Anson, lounging across the room, noticed Vivi’s entrance.
.

.
###Chapter 598:
His gaze swept over her, laden with blatant lust.
“Vivi’s back,” he said.
At that, Moses looked up from the contract he was scrutinizing.
He saw the slender woman standing next to his daughter.
He cleared his throat. “Vivi, who’s this?”
Vivi shot a disdainful look at Kyla before reluctantly introducing her. “A friend. She’s staying for a while.”
“That would be great.” Moses’ eyes sparkled briefly with intrigue, but he composed himself swiftly. He nudged his daughter into a seat. “Anson has brought many gifts for you. Don’t let him down.”
He then smiled at Kyla warmly. “Please, make yourself comfortable.” Kyla managed a strained smile.
During lunch, Kyla felt Moses’ hand creep onto her thigh, which quelled her appetite. Was this just jumping from the frying pan into the fire? Yet, she restrained her anger. As a guest, causing a scene could leave her without a roof over her head.
Moses, sensing no resistance, grew bolder. He poured wine for the group, tasting it first.
“Let’s drink,” he said.
He exchanged a knowing look with Anson.
Anson smirked, lifting his glass toward Vivi. “Join me?”
Vivi was cautious, but seeing her father drink the wine confidently, she slowly picked up her glass. Despite the circumstances, she knew she couldn’t afford to alienate Anson at this moment. With that in mind, she drank her wine. It was intoxicating.
Before long, both Vivi and Kyla started to feel the effects of the wine, becoming lightheaded.
Anson and Moses exchanged a look that clearly communicated their intentions. Anson stood up first, lifting Vivi with ease. “She’s had too much to drink. I’ll take her upstairs to rest.”

Moses nodded quickly, his anticipation barely hidden. “Of course, Anson. Please, take your time.”
As Anson carried Vivi away, Moses focused on Kyla, who was slumped over the table, her posture more revealing than intended.
Overcome with desire, Moses reached under her clothes.
“Noah…” Kyla murmured, her response almost encouraging as she leaned into his touch.
Moses took this as his cue, wrapping an arm around her waist. “Let’s go upstairs, darling,” he whispered.
Meanwhile, outside the villa, Samuel had been watching. He confirmed that Kyla had entered but had not left.
After deliberating, he returned to Myrtlewood Estate.
Upon entering, he found his boss alone, exuding a cold, distant aura. Glancing upstairs at the closed master bedroom door, Samuel inferred the situation.noveldrama
It seemed Mr. Wall was once again disregarded by his wife.
Approaching cautiously, Samuel reported, “Mr. Wall, Miss Wade is at the Quinn family’s villa.”
“The Quinn family?” Noah’s response was sharp as he set down his wine glass, his expression sardonic. “Then the Quinn family has to leave the city, too.”

###Chapter 599:
Accustomed to his boss’s harsh directives, Samuel was about to exit when Noah spoke again.
“Wait.”
Samuel stopped, attentive.
“Order dinner from Nirvana,” Noah said, his tone even and emotionless.
Samuel paused, surprised.
Nirvana? Wasn’t that the restaurant Mrs. Wall had adored three years ago?
Since her departure, Mr. Wall had avoided it entirely.
Though curious, Samuel knew better than to question.
“Yes, Mr. Wall.” He left to arrange the order.
Back in the dining room, Noah lifted his wine glass, emptying it in one swift motion. His gaze swept over the deserted table, his thoughts hidden in the shadows.
The table was soon filled with an array of steaming dishes.
Samuel and Breck stood silently off to the side, neither daring to speak. They shared a brief glance, both sensing a shift in the evening’s atmosphere.
Noah then turned to Breck.
Under Noah’s intense gaze, Breck hesitantly made his way upstairs to fetch Sadie.
Sadie was in the study, immersed in the documents Amy had provided. Since her return from Sawnard Estate, she had been feeling uneasy—something bad was about to happen.
The sound of a knock on the door interrupted her focus.
Breck entered.
“Mrs. Wall, dinner is served. Mr. Wall requests your presence.”
gα?ησν?s?com makes every story special
Noting the time—well past four in the afternoon—and feeling a bit hungry, Sadie closed her folder, stood, and followed Breck downstairs. Upon seeing Noah at the dining table and dishes from Nirvana, Sadie halted abruptly.
Three years ago, after every disagreement, Noah would order from Nirvana as a peace offering. Sharing a meal signified a chance to reconcile.
The sight triggered a flood of emotions.
She stood frozen, unsure of how to proceed.
Just then, Averi returned from school.
“Wow, so much delicious food!” Averi exclaimed, pulling on Sadie’s hand, which somewhat eased the tension. “Mommy, let’s eat!”
Averi’s simple enthusiasm thawed the chill in the air.
With a resigned smile, Sadie sat down at Averi’s insistent tug.
Averi eagerly grabbed his knife and fork, sampling the food.
“Mmm! It’s delicious! Mommy, you have to try it too!”
Motivated by Averi’s expectant eyes, Sadie picked up her knife and fork. The flavors were a vivid reminder of times past, evoking deep-seated memories. Her eyes moistened with tears she struggled to hold back.
Meanwhile, Noah ate quietly, his gaze fixed on her.
Averi, after a few bites, jumped up and ran to Noah, clinging to his arm.
“Mr. Wall, do a puzzle with me!”
Noah’s expression softened as he looked down at Averi.
“Okay.”

###Chapter 600:
Soon after, Averi returned with his puzzle, and Noah stood to join him. Sadie watched them from the table, her emotions swirling.
As Noah spent time assembling the puzzle with Averi, he glanced up and noticed Sadie sitting alone, her head bowed, her shoulders quivering slightly as if she were crying.
A tightness formed in his chest. He walked over and stood beside her.
“Sadie…”
She looked up, her eyes rimmed red, as she fought back tears.
Seeing her so upset, Noah was struck by a wave of remorse.
“Sadie, about the competition…”
Sadie hadn’t expected him to bring up the competition.
“I wasn’t fully aware of the details,” Noah said quietly. “When Kyla brought it up, I agreed without giving it much thought.” He paused, searching for the right words.
“If I had known you were competing too, I never would have consented.”
Sadie hadn’t expected Noah to offer an explanation.
She set her utensils down and stared at him, dazed, unsure how to respond.
The door swung open suddenly, and Samuel hurried in.
“Mr. and Mrs. Wall,” he said, glancing at Sadie with a moment’s hesitation. “The police are here. They say they’re here for you, Mrs. Wall.”
“The police?” Noah and Sadie exchanged confused looks. What could have happened?
The police car sped toward the hospital.
Sadie sat in the back seat, her hands clenched tightly, her knuckles white.

Her mind was a whirl of confusion.
As soon as they arrived, the sharp scent of antiseptic hit her.
Sadie nearly ran to keep up with the officers as they led her to the ICU.
Through the glass, she saw Amy.
The once elegant and poised woman now lay still in the hospital bed, connected to various machines with tubes and wires. Her face was pale as paper, devoid of life.
Sadie’s heart tightened in anguish.
How could this be?
Amy had been in perfect health earlier that day.
“Amy!” Sadie gasped, her hands pressed against the cold glass.
A doctor came over.
“She suffered severe head trauma and was in shock upon arrival.
We’ve done everything possible, yet…”
He hesitated, clearly struggling to deliver more bad news.
“She’s now in a deep coma, in what we medically term a vegetative state.”
“A vegetative state?”
Sadie echoed the term, her voice tinged with disbelief.
At that moment, another officer approached Noah.
“Mr. Wall, we have information from a waitress at Sawnard Estate suggesting Miss Hudson’s involvement in this case.”

###Chapter 601:
Noah’s expression darkened, his eyes narrowing as he regarded the officer.
“What proof do you have?”
“The surveillance video captured Miss Hudson leaving the private room last,” the officer stated, carefully measuring his words. “We need Miss Hudson to come with us for further questioning.”
Not far off, Sadie overheard their conversation.
She looked at Amy, struggling to breathe, and clenched her fists.
In that moment, she made the decision.
“I’m willing to cooperate with the investigation,” Sadie declared. “Amy has been both a mentor and a friend for three years. I need to know who did this to her.”
She began to walk away, then paused, turning back to Noah.
“Don’t worry, I’ll be okay. Please look after Averi for me.”
Noah, seeing the determination in her eyes, simply nodded.
“I’ll arrange for a lawyer to follow up.”
Sadie departed with one of the officers.
Another officer stepped forward to reassure Noah, “Rest assured, Mr. Wall, we will take good care of Miss Hudson.”
Left alone outside the ICU, Noah called out, “Samuel!”
Samuel approached immediately.noveldrama
“Mr. Wall,”
“Find out what happened,” Noah commanded.
“Understood,” Samuel responded, quickly heading down the corridor.
Lаττ ch?ρτ?rs ιn glov?ls.
Sadie hadn’t been in the interrogation room for long when a young female officer entered with a tray.
“Mrs. Wall, your husband sent this for you.” She placed the tray on the table.
Stunned, Sadie looked at the steaming dishes before her—shrimp puff pastries, crab cake sliders, and mango parfait—all her usual favorites.
“Did he say anything?” Sadie asked, her voice hoarse.
The officer smiled.
“He told you to eat well and not to worry. He said he’ll handle everything.”
“Everything.”
She paused, a hint of envy in her voice.
“Your husband really cares about you.”
A rush of mixed emotions swept through Sadie.
Noah? He had sent her a late-night snack.
Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Sadie, Noah was in the police station’s lounge.
“Mr. Wall, we’ve found something,” Samuel announced, breaking the silence.
“It was a waitress from Sawnard Estate who reported the incident. Mrs. Wall was there because Mr. Nigel Wall had arranged it, and Amy was invited by him too. But he left early.”
Noah’s expression darkened.
“What about the surveillance footage?”
“The manager at Sawnard Estate reported that the cameras are broken and currently being repaired. As for the waitress’s bank accounts, nothing unusual was noted, and there were no large transactions. The waitress is in the car now.”
.

###Chapter 602:
Noah stood and walked briskly out of the police station toward a black car parked at the roadside.
As the car door opened and he got in, Noah saw a young waitress sitting in the back seat, bound and sweating profusely.
Seeing Noah, she kept her head down.
“What’s going on here?” Noah asked, his gaze fixed on the ropes binding her.
“Mr. Wall, she attempted to flee earlier,” Samuel explained.
Noah’s cold stare remained on the trembling waitress.
“Why did you try to run?”
The waitress shivered.
Though she was unaware of the identity of the imposing man before her, she sensed it was better not to provoke him.
“I just reported what I saw. I don’t know anything else. Please, let me go!” she stammered, her teeth chattering.
“Take her out.”
Seeing the waitress’s refusal to cooperate, Noah signaled to the two bodyguards beside him.
Without hesitation, they carried the waitress out of the car.
“Have someone keep an eye on her around the clock,” Noah instructed, casting a meaningful glance at Samuel.
“Yes, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded with respect.
Just then, he remembered something important.
“Mr. Wall, the team of neurology specialists from abroad has arrived at the hospital. They’ve begun consulting on Amy’s case.”
è ￠?ΔT?εЯ? ?η ?a?иoν.
Noah nodded slightly in acknowledgment.
Though the waitress had been removed from the car, fear still gripped her.
As her anxiety mounted, her fingers trembled, and she pulled out her phone to dial Vivi’s number.
The phone rang endlessly without an answer.
What was going on? Why wasn’t Vivi picking up? Had something happened to her as well?
With her heart racing, the waitress rushed to the curb and flagged down a taxi.
“Take me to the Quinn family’s villa. Hurry, please,” she said.
The taxi accelerated into the night.
Unbeknownst to her, a nondescript black car silently followed at a distance.
Meanwhile, at the Quinn family’s villa, Vivi jolted awake.
In the darkness, she saw a man lying next to her—completely naked.
Anson? How could this be?
A chill coursed through her. She rubbed her eyes frantically, hoping she was mistaken.
“Why are you in my bed?”
Anson stirred, his eyes opening slowly, his expression bewildered as if still piecing together the situation.
Then Vivi noticed marks on her skin. She gasped, panic overtaking her.
“Get out! Now!”noveldrama

###Chapter 603:
She snatched the nearest pillow and hurled it at Anson, her voice quivering with fury.
Anson narrowly avoided the pillow, his expression shifting to one of irritation. “Are you crazy?”
Vivi was overwhelmed with emotion, sobbing and screaming, her breaths short and panicked amidst the rising hysteria.
Suddenly, a commotion erupted from the next room, punctuated by Kyla’s voice.
Vivi’s cries faltered.
What was happening to Kyla?
Before she could gather her thoughts, there was a knock at the door.
“Miss, there’s a young woman downstairs asking for you. She says her name is Tiana Thatcher,” the butler announced, urgency in his voice.
Tiana?
Vivi was startled.
Hadn’t she paid Tiana to leave?
A chill of foreboding washed over her.
With no time to dwell on Kyla’s situation, Vivi hurried downstairs.
In the living room, Tiana stood, her demeanor anxious.
Upon seeing Vivi, Tiana rushed over. “Miss Quinn!”
“Why are you here?”
“Miss Quinn, I’m scared,” Tiana said, tears brimming in her eyes. “I’m in trouble… A man was asking about what happened this morning,” she blurted out, her voice thick with fear.
Vivi’s stomach dropped.
Your update hub: g?lησνs?c?m
A man?
Could it be Noah?
“What did he look like? Was he tall? Handsome? Did he seem wealthy?” Vivi probed, trying to confirm her suspicion based on Tiana’s description.
Tiana nodded frantically, then hesitated, her certainty faltering under the stress.
But Vivi was certain. It had to be Noah.
“Did you come here alone? Were you followed?” Vivi gripped Tiana’s hand, her tone urgent.
The stakes were high. If someone had followed Tiana, they were both in danger.
Tiana blinked, overwhelmed, not fully grasping the severity of the situation.
A wave of dizziness overwhelmed Vivi, nearly causing her to stumble.
“You disgusting old bastard! Let go of me!”
Upstairs, the silence was shattered by Kyla’s enraged scream.
She was clad only in a flimsy camisole, her back marked suggestively. She struggled fiercely against Moses, whose face was unnaturally flushed with excitement.
“You disgusting creep, let go of me!” Kyla shouted as she struggled.
Vivi’s eyes widened in shock as she instantly grasped what was happening.noveldrama
Fueled by rage, she stormed upstairs. When she saw Kyla, her anger erupted, and she slapped her forcefully.
“You shameless woman, how dare you seduce my father?” Vivi accused, grabbing Kyla by the neck with a firm grip.
.
.
.
###Chapter 604:
Stunned by the slap, Kyla momentarily lost her bearings. Regaining her senses, she shoved Vivi away, screaming in protest, “That’s absurd! Why would I seduce him? He’s the one who should be ashamed!”
“Enough! Both of you, shut up!” Moses interjected, his voice booming as his temples throbbed visibly.
He shifted his piercing gaze from Vivi to Tiana, who stood nearby.
“What’s going on with her?” he demanded sternly.
Vivi faltered, her eyes flickering as she stammered, “She… she just came to talk to me about something.”
But Moses, having raised Vivi, saw through the excuse. His suspicion deepened the more she tried to deflect.
“Mr. Quinn.”
A deep voice suddenly cut through the tension. Anson, buttoning his shirt, descended the stairs with casual indifference.
“Vivi hurt Amy and pinned the blame on Sadie,” he stated calmly, as if discussing a trivial matter.
Vivi’s face drained of color at his words.
She stared at Anson in horror, her voice quivering.
“How do you know?”
Anson didn’t respond directly, merely offering a nonchalant glance her way.
Tiana moved to Anson’s side, her head lowered, avoiding eye contact with Vivi.
Struck by the revelation, Vivi felt as if lightning had hit her.noveldrama
Tiana wasn’t there for help—she was working for Anson. It was all a setup.
gα?ησν?s．?оm takes you away
Moses, in a sudden fury, backhanded Vivi, sending her sprawling on the floor.
“Didn’t I tell you to talk to Amy and secure the deal with Zoe? How could you hurt Amy?” he roared, his eyes bloodshot with anger.
Vivi clutched her face, tears streaming down her cheeks.
“Amy was biased. She never intended to help me. She deserved it!”
At this point, further excuses were pointless.
Moses suppressed his anger and turned to Anson, mustering a sycophantic smile.
“Anson, Vivi was just not thinking clearly. Please, be magnanimous and don’t hold it against her. We need your support and the marriage alliance.”
Anson regarded Vivi with a faint smile.
“My grandfather is concerned about Vivi’s reputation, but I am indifferent. However, the Quinn family is now at odds with the Wall family. You should be aware of Noah’s capabilities. He will find out what Vivi did.”
Anson paused, seeming to consider the Quinn family’s situation.
“If the Quinn family wants a chance at survival, there’s only one way—to ally with my family against the Wall family.”
Moses furrowed his brows.
Anson was correct. Moses had seen Noah’s cruelty firsthand.
But Anson was just the heir, not the head of the Olson family. Could he really make such decisions?
Moreover, even the Howe and Perry families, when allied, hadn’t managed any advantage over Noah.
The Perry family had even relocated abroad entirely.
.
.
.
###Chapter 605:
What chance did the Quinn family have?
“Mr. Quinn, you’re being short-sighted,” Anson said, looking at Moses with disdain. “The Howe and Perry families failed because Alex betrayed his family. But if our two families work closely together, we can succeed. Mr. Quinn, don’t you want to achieve something great?”
Moses stared at Anson, his gaze flickering with uncertainty.
If they could genuinely challenge the Wall family, the Quinn family wouldn’t have to be subordinate to anyone.
“Anson, are you serious? If our families unite, can we truly succeed?” Moses asked, his voice tense.
He swallowed hard, his throat tight.
Anson looked confident. “Of course, Mr. Quinn. You’re a smart man. This is the best opportunity for the Quinn family. The decision to seize it is yours.”
Moses’s breathing quickened, but his years in business allowed him to maintain a semblance of rationality.
Striving to appear calm, he inquired, “Anson, you speak of cooperation, but what specific form should this take? You know dealing with Noah is no small challenge.”
Anson had prepared for this question and responded smoothly, “Rest assured, Mr. Quinn. True cooperation requires both parties to demonstrate sincerity and unity. Right now, Noah could crush you at any moment. We are also taking a significant risk. Thus, the Quinn Group needs to transfer sixty percent of its shares to the Olson Group.”
Moses gasped.
Sixty percent! That demand was exorbitant.
“Anson, isn’t that a bit excessive?” Moses asked.
€$? ?н?tя? 1π ?alиoνε.
“Dad, agree to it,” Vivi suddenly interjected, having been silent until now.
Her mind was overwhelmed with the fear of Noah’s retribution, and the possibility of imprisonment left her shaking. She rushed to Moses, grabbing his arm with urgency.
“Dad, please, we have to agree. We have no other choice!”
Vivi leaned in closer to Moses, her tone persuasive.
“If we take Noah down, not just a portion, but the entire Wall Group will be within our grasp!”
Moses hesitated.
Anson watched from the side, a smirk playing on his lips.
The trap had been set, and Moses had taken the bait.
“Fine, I’m in,” Moses finally said through gritted teeth, making his decision.
Money made the world go round. For the Quinn family’s future, he was willing to take the risk.
Anson chuckled, clapping his hands.
“Mr. Quinn, you truly are a man of action.”
Right on cue, a subordinate approached with a pre-prepared contract.
“Review it, and if everything checks out, sign here.”
Moses skimmed through the document.
Each clause was harsher than the last, leaving him no way out.
Still, he picked up the pen and scrawled his name.
.
.
.noveldrama
###Chapter 606:
Satisfied, Anson tucked the contract away before turning to Vivi with a teasing glint in his eye.
“Darling, you were great last night.”
Vivi’s cheeks burned. She wished the ground would swallow her whole.
Without another word, Anson strode out, dragging along a trembling Tiana.
Vivi clenched her fists.
None of this mattered. As long as Noah was defeated, everything would be worth it.
Once Anson took his place, she could claim the title of the most powerful and revered woman in the city.
Holding onto that thought, she returned to her room, a victorious smile on her lips.
Kyla stood nearby, confused and oblivious to the scheme that had just unfolded.
“Kyla, you don’t have to worry. I’ll make sure you’re taken care of,” Moses said as he stepped toward her, slipping an arm around her waist.
“Stick with me, and you’ll never want for anything.”
Suppressing her revulsion, Kyla forced a playful smile.
“Mr. Quinn, aren’t you afraid your wife will find out?”
Moses let out a hearty laugh, lifting her effortlessly and heading toward the bedroom.
“That old hag is nothing compared to you. Now, let me show you how much I appreciate you.”
Moments later, the unmistakable sounds of passion filled the air.
Meanwhile, outside the Quinn family’s estate, in a sleek black luxury car, Tiana curled up at Anson’s feet, her voice trembling.

“Mr. Olson, I was terrified back there.”
Anson glanced down, amusement flickering in his gaze.
“You handled it well.”
Relieved by his praise, Tiana exhaled.
“Thank you, Mr. Olson. If not for you, my siblings wouldn’t even afford school, let alone have the jobs you arranged for them,” she said, her voice laced with gratitude, eyes glistening with emotion.
The Olson family’s kindness was something she would never forget.
Anson reached out, patting her head lightly.
“Stay loyal, and you’ll be rewarded.”
Tiana nodded eagerly.
Upon arriving at the Olson family’s residence, Anson handed a document to Damian, who examined it with satisfaction.
“Perfect. Sixty percent of the Quinn Group’s shares now belong to us,” the old man said, stroking his beard, pleased with their success.
Anson allowed himself a brief smile before regaining his composure.
“Grandfather, what about the remaining shares?”
Damian’s eyes gleamed with cunning as he lowered his voice.
“Those fools have no idea that our deal is nothing but a snare. Once the partnership launches tomorrow, the remaining forty percent will fall into our hands. It’s time to face Noah. The Quinns are no longer of use.”
Damian had waited a long time for this day.
.

###Chapter 607:
He motioned for Anson to take a seat.
“Your strategy was brilliant, Grandfather,” Anson mused, recalling Vivi’s desperate determination, a cold smirk forming.
Initially, Tiana was meant to act against Amy after Vivi had left, but surprisingly, Vivi had hurt her own mentor before Tiana made the move.
“Only an idiot like Moses would believe we’d actually help him take over the Wall Group,” Damian sneered.
From the beginning, he had never considered the Quinns as anything more than pawns.
But Vivi’s recklessness had not only secured them the Quinn Group’s shares—it had also created an opportunity to win Noah’s trust. Two birds, one stone.
At the entrance of the police station, Samuel climbed into a sleek business car, tablet in hand. “Mr. Wall, we’ve recovered the surveillance footage.”
Noah took the device, his gaze darkening as he watched Vivi enter the private room.
Samuel continued, “Also, the person monitoring Tiana confirmed she went to the Quinn family’s residence.”
The evidence was damning—Vivi was directly involved in the case.
A bodyguard approached the car and leaned in to whisper, “Mr. Wall, Anson has just arrived—and he brought Tiana along.”
Noah’s eyes narrowed. Excellent timing.
“I’m sorry for disturbing you at this late hour, Mr. Wall,” Anson said, sliding into the plush back seat with a grin practically plastered on his face. “My family originally intended to partner with the Quinns, but we never imagined they’d pull a stunt like this. It’s an absolute disgrace!” He unleashed a theatrical sigh. “I bumped into Tiana and learned that Vivi framed Miss Hudson. Can you believe it? Naturally, I brought Tiana straight to you so she could explain in person.”
Beside him, Tiana trembled, fragile and pitiable.
Anson’s little monologue was impeccably crafted, exonerating himself completely.
New updates live on gαlησνe?s?com
“Mr. Wall, it was Vivi!” Tiana wailed, tears streaming as she collapsed to her knees. “She forced me to go along with her plan—please, forgive me! I had no idea what was happening!” What a show.
“How considerate of you, Mr. Olson,” Noah remarked, his voice giving nothing away.
Realizing Noah wasn’t pressing for details, Anson exhaled a discreet sigh of relief and seized the moment.
“Actually, Mr. Wall… my family has a new project in the works. We’ve been hoping to collaborate with the Wall Group. Would you be open to talking it over?”
He rubbed his hands together, finally revealing his true agenda.noveldrama
“Come by Wall Group on Monday,” Noah said calmly. “We’ll discuss it then.”
“That’s wonderful news! Thank you, Mr. Wall!” Anson replied, grinning from ear to ear as he bobbed his head in gratitude. He’d braced himself for a hard sell and was stunned by how easily things had gone.
“In that case, I won’t keep you any longer, Mr. Wall. See you next week.”
Not long after Anson left, Tiana was quietly led away by the bodyguards, and the car slid into silence once again.
“Samuel.”
.

.
###Chapter 608:
“Yes, Mr. Wall?”
“Look into the Olson family,” Noah said, his voice frost-cold. “This wasn’t just some random coincidence.”
“Understood,” Samuel replied. He cast a worried glance at Noah. “Sir, would you like to get some rest? We won’t be able to bail out Mrs. Wall until tomorrow anyway.”
Noah, who had been waiting ever since Sadie was taken, just shook his head.
“No need.” He rubbed his temples, his voice husky with fatigue. “Have everything ready. I’ll catch up on the backlog of work in a bit.”
“Yes, sir.”
The next morning, at the Quinn family’s estate.
“Kyla, have you no shame? Are you seriously messing around with my dad now? Is there anything you won’t do?” Vivi shouted, fixing Kyla with a furious glare as the latter sat calmly at the dining table.
Unhurried, Kyla placed her coffee cup on its saucer. “Watch your tone, Vivi,” she replied. “We’re tied together now. If things start falling apart, we’ll both go down.”
Vivi bristled, her fury rattling in her chest, but she found herself at a loss for words.
“Don’t waste your breath on her, Kyla,” Moses interjected, coming down the stairs while neatly straightening his tie.
He moved to Kyla’s side and kissed her cheek. “Let’s eat.”
“Dad!” Vivi shrieked, shooting to her feet and stamping in frustration. “I’m not hungry!”
She still couldn’t wrap her mind around the fact that her own biological father had orchestrated her encounter with Anson, and in the meantime, Kyla had slept with her father.
Moses was about to respond when frantic footsteps sounded in the hall.
Stay tuned galnov.co
“Mr. Quinn, something terrible has happened!” Moses’s assistant said, stumbling over himself in his rush, sweat pouring down his forehead.noveldrama
“What’s got you so worked up? Speak up!” Moses barked, though a flicker of dread began to tighten in his gut.
“The—The company, the company has been completely taken over!” Moses’s assistant sputtered, clearly on the verge of tears. “The contract with the Olson Group was nothing but a trap. The Quinn Group is done for!”
Moses felt a wave of despair wash over him. His vision blurred, and his body swayed for a few seconds before he collapsed to the floor.
“Dad!”
“Mr. Quinn!”
“Moses!”
The room erupted into chaos.
“What the hell happened?” Vivi rushed to the assistant and grabbed him by the collar. “Was it Noah? Did he discover the truth and decide to come after us?”
The assistant shook his head nervously, compounding the dizziness he felt from Vivi’s violent shaking. “It wasn’t the Wall Group. It was… the Olson Group!”
Vivi froze.
“The Olson Group’s new energy project has collapsed. They are demanding us to fulfill the contract within three months, but all of our partnered manufacturers called last night, one by one, to terminate their contracts with us. Even if we manage to find alternative suppliers, it’s too late at this point. The Olson Group has invoked the terms of the contract and seized the remaining forty percent of the Quinn Group’s shares. They own one hundred percent of the company as we speak…”
.
.
.
###Chapter 609:
The assistant’s voice grew weaker with each word, and toward the end, it was nothing more than a whisper. “I’ve sent people to look into the matter. According to their report, those manufacturers acted under pressure from the Olson family.”
A realization struck Vivi then, like a bolt of lightning from the sky. They had been played from the very beginning— it was a trap all along.
“I’ll make you pay for this, Anson!” Vivi screamed as she stormed out of the villa to confront Anson.
“Damn it!” Kyla balled her hands into fists. She needed to find a way out.
Without wasting another second, she stuffed all the cash and jewelry she could get her hands on into a suitcase. After everything she had heard, she was convinced that the Quinn family was finished.
As she drew near the second floor landing, the noise downstairs grew louder and louder.
“Where is Moses? Get him out here!”
“No one leaves this place until we get our money!”
“Enough of this! Let’s just go in and take everything of value!” The creditors had come to collect their debts.
Kyla felt the color drain from her face. There was no telling what would happen to her if they caught her.
She rushed down the stairs, but instead of using the front door, she bolted through the more covert back door, which led to the garden. She had been foolish to think she had secured herself a powerful backer. The Quinn family was as useless as they came—they failed at the most crucial of times.noveldrama
But Kyla had no time to dwell on this setback.
She had just snuck through the back door and was about to breathe a sigh of relief when several dark figures stepped out of the shadows and blocked her path.
Read exclusive updates gα?ησvls?com
“Where might you be off to, Miss Wade?” the man in the lead asked with a look of indifference.
Kyla looked up at the sound of his voice and immediately recognized the team of bodyguards. They were Noah’s men.
Her heart sank. It was over for her!
In the chaos that had unfolded, it had slipped her mind that Noah was still investigating the Quinn family. Now that they were facing their downfall, there was no way Noah would let her walk away.
“I…” Kyla tried to speak, but the words wouldn’t come out of her mouth. Not that any of that mattered, since the men weren’t interested in hearing her explanation. Without another word, they grabbed her and dragged her away.
The police station.
Sadie was released soon after Noah submitted the evidence. She spotted his car parked by the curb as soon as she stepped outside. Sadie hurried over and got in.
“What on earth happened?” she asked urgently.
Samuel glanced at Noah, who remained silent. He took the initiative to answer on Noah’s behalf.
“Anson delivered the evidence last night. Vivi was behind everything.”
But Sadie was even more puzzled by this development. She had heard about the Olson-Quinn marriage alliance—why would Anson suddenly help her?
“Something doesn’t add up,” she muttered under her breath, her brows furrowed.
The car slowly pulled away from the police station.
Up ahead, the road split into two—one leading to Myrtlewood Estate, the other to the hospital.
.
.
.
###Chapter 610:
“I want to visit Amy,” Sadie said, looking at Noah.
Still, he said nothing, and his deep-set eyes remained unreadable. The driver hesitated at the fork, and the car stalled as he waited for Noah’s instruction.
The air inside the car immediately grew thick with tension, and Sadie felt her chest tighten. Would Noah let her see Amy? After all, he had never shown much interest in her affairs.
In the end, the car moved forward in the direction of Myrtlewood Estate.
“You’ll go after eating,” Noah said calmly, finally breaking his silence.
Sadie blinked, momentarily caught off-guard by his gentle tone. Then, as if she had just realized her hunger, her hand went to her stomach. Everything had happened so fast, she hadn’t even noticed how hungry she was.
She nodded slightly and hummed, then leaned back in her seat.
Once they were at Myrtlewood Estate, Sadie quickly finished her meal. “May I go now?” she asked Noah, her eyes filled with hopeful expectation.
She was worried about Amy’s condition.
“Of course.” Noah set his cutlery down and stood up. “Have Breck arrange for a car to take you.”
With that, he turned and walked away. He likely had more important matters to take care of.
Shortly after Sadie had left, Samuel walked into Noah’s study with a document. His face was grim. “We found something, Mr. Wall.”
Samuel placed the document on the desk in front of Noah.
Noah opened the file and skimmed through the report, his brows knitted into a frown.
“Tiana’s younger siblings were sponsored by a foreign company to complete their university education years ago. That company was the Olson Group’s branch.”
Feel inspired by ga ln o vels . com
Noah set the file down and sat back in his chair.
This piece of information wasn’t unexpected, but he was not pleased nonetheless. The Olson family certainly knew how to extend their reach.noveldrama
“What’s the situation with the Quinn family?” Noah asked Samuel.
“The news broke early this morning. The Olson Group has the Quinn Group’s shares now, making Moses nothing more than a figurehead chairman.”
“A coordinated scheme, huh?” Noah muttered, his lips curling into a mocking smile. He sure had underestimated the Olson family. They had used Vivi to work against Sadie, then eventually betrayed her and swallowed the Quinn Group in one go. Hit two birds with one stone, as the saying went, and they had executed that flawlessly.
Samuel shifted his weight and hesitated before asking, “How should we deal with the Olson family, Mr. Wall?”
Instead of answering him, Noah said, “I heard that the Olson family has set their sights on that piece of land in the north of Jazmah. Is that right?”
“Yes.”
“Give it to the Jenkins family,” Noah instructed calmly.
Samuel immediately understood his boss’s intention. The Jenkins family was the Olson family’s greatest rival. For years, the two forces had been locked in a subtle yet fierce battle, with neither side ever gaining the upper hand for long. They had learned to use every trick in the book to undermine each other—behind the scenes, of course.
It wasn’t that long ago when the Olson family had orchestrated a scandal involving the Jenkins family heiress and a thug. The uproar that followed rocked the entire city and brought disgrace upon the Jenkins family.
.
.
.
###Chapter 611:
If the Jenkins family secured the project in the north of the city, their influence would significantly increase, and they would no doubt use the opportunity to retaliate against the Olson family. Just like this, Noah would be the one pulling strings behind the scenes.
“I’ll take care of it right away,” Samuel said, turning to leave. But when he reached the door, he hesitated again.
“Is there something else?” Noah called out, cocking his head to the side.
“Miss Wade has been restrained,” Samuel said warily. “But she keeps struggling and insists on seeing you. She keeps mentioning the debt you owed her for saving your life years ago.”
His voice was quiet. He knew all too well that Noah despised getting blackmailed using that one incident.
Sure enough, Noah scowled. “I’ll go see her, then.”
He stood from his chair and left the study with Samuel.
Minutes later, a taxi pulled up outside Myrtlewood Estate. Laura stepped out, a gentle smile on her face, a thermos in hand. She hadn’t been comfortable staying at Myrtlewood Estate, so she had moved back to her old apartment a few days ago. Today, she had especially made some soup for Sadie and was just bringing it over.
Laura glanced at the car that had just driven away, then at the thermos she was holding. The soup wouldn’t taste good if it got cold.
Assuming that it was Sadie in the other car, Laura got back inside the taxi.
“Sir, please follow that car,” she said to the driver.
He wasted no time and stepped on the gas while Noah’s car was still within sight. They trailed after Noah’s car as it drove down a secluded road and eventually stopped in front of a cafe.
Laura paid the fare, got out with her thermos, and quickly made her way to the cafe.
Just as she reached the entrance, she heard a heated argument coming from inside. A sharp, familiar voice rang out—Kyla.
Exclusive updates gαlησνs.c?mnoveldrama
“Noah, you can’t treat me like this! Have you forgotten who saved you back then?” she sounded hoarse and desperate.
“If it weren’t for that debt, do you think you would still be alive right now?” Noah countered coldly. “When you tried to kill Sadie three years ago, you were already dead to me.”
Kyla froze. Her eyes widened, and her trembling lips parted, but she couldn’t muster a single word. So Noah knew everything? Her heart sank.
“Noah, I—I was wrong!” Fresh tears streamed down Kyla’s face. She lunged forward and tried to grab at Noah’s sleeve. “Please, don’t abandon me. I won’t do it again! I won’t, I promise! I’ll apologize to Sadie—I’ll beg for her forgiveness!”
But Noah was unmoved. “I won’t hold what Ryder did against you,” he said blandly, “but don’t you dare test my patience again.”
He paused, and his next words were spoken with emphasis. “Leave Jazmah. Live a quiet and honest life from now on.” After saying that, Noah turned to leave.
“Noah! Noah, wait!” Kyla chased after him, unwilling to give up just yet. “I still need to pack my things. Can I leave tomorrow?”
She clung to a sliver of hope, praying that Noah would change his mind.
Noah stopped in his tracks but didn’t bother to look back at her. “Samuel, take Miss Wade out of Jazmah tomorrow.”
“Yes, Mr. Wall,” Samuel replied promptly.
With that, Noah resolutely walked away.
.
.
.
###Chapter 612:
Thinking on her feet, Laura quickly darted behind some bushes just before Noah emerged through the door.
Laura had overheard everything in the cafe. Three years ago? Her granddaughter Sadie had actually faced so much injustice three years ago!
Determined not to let Sadie suffer any further, Laura resolved to confront Kyla.
Kyla wiped her tears away. She couldn’t just abandon everything in Jazmah; as long as she could buy some time, there was still a chance to turn things around. She staggered out of the cafe and headed toward the sidewalk. Laura stepped out from behind the greenery, thermos in hand, and quickly followed Kyla.
At the traffic light, Kyla stood waiting impatiently.noveldrama
“Miss, please wait a moment,” Laura, catching her breath, called out as she approached.
Kyla turned, annoyance creasing her brow at the sight of an elderly lady with a thermos. She didn’t recognize Laura.
“Do you need something?” Kyla asked, her tone brusque.
“I’m Sadie’s grandmother,” Laura explained, her voice as kind and gentle as she could manage. “I overheard your conversation in the cafe just now.”
Kyla’s complexion turned ashen. She remembered Laura now. It was because of her that Noah had almost ended her life back then.
“Miss, please let it go,” Laura implored earnestly, “Forcing someone’s affection is futile. Noah doesn’t love you. Clinging to him won’t change his feelings.”
A sinister look flickered in Kyla’s eyes. Let go? How could she let go? How could she possibly let go after everything she’d sacrificed for Noah?
“Please, stop harming Sadie. She’s innocent and doesn’t deserve this. I’m begging you, please!”
“Innocent?” Kyla scoffed, her voice laced with scorn. “She took everything from me, and you call her innocent?”
Ltеst chαpt?rs in glovs.
Her anger surged, and she glared at Laura with intense disdain. In her mind, all her misfortunes were because of Sadie.
“Get out of my way!”
Kyla shoved Laura aside and attempted to leave.
Laura lost her balance and staggered, crying out as she nearly fell. “Ah!” At that moment, a car sped toward them.
Laura was struck and sent flying through the air, landing hard on the ground. The thermos she had been carrying tumbled from her grasp, its contents spilling across the pavement. It all happened in a flash.
Kyla stood frozen, her mind blank from shock. After a moment, she stumbled back, then turned and fled into the crowd.
Laura’s consciousness began to wane. She struggled to remain awake, her eyes on Kyla’s retreating figure. Finally, her eyes slowly closed.
At the hospital, Sadie inquired urgently, “Excuse me, how is Amy Flores doing?”
The nurse checked her clipboard and offered a reassuring smile. “Ms. Flores’s surgery was very successful. The brain specialists Mr. Wall brought from abroad managed to repair the damaged nerves. If her recovery goes well, she should be waking up soon.”
Sadie was surprised. Noah had taken her back to Myrtlewood Estate for a meal before letting her come to the hospital because he wanted to surprise her?
A warm feeling surged in her heart.
Suddenly, she felt a twitch in her chest. What was happening?
.
.
.
###Chapter 613:
Her chest tightened. It felt as though something significant had occurred.
Sadie walked away quietly, taking a moment to compose herself. Since Noah had helped her, she pulled out her phone, dialing his number as she exited the hospital.
As she walked past the emergency room, a gurney sped by. Something hard dropped onto the floor near Sadie’s feet. Instinctively, she glanced down. A familiar jade pendant lay silently at her feet. It was a white magnolia, the very keepsake Laura always kept close—a gift from her grandfather symbolizing their affection, never leaving her side.
Trembling, Sadie reached down to pick up the pendant. She raised her eyes toward the gurney; an elderly person lay atop it, their face covered in blood, beyond recognition. Sadie felt a violent tremor in her heart.
“Hello? Sadie, what’s wrong?” Noah’s deep voice sounded through the phone as the call connected.
Sadie seemed unresponsive, her mind a void. The phone slipped from her grasp. Ignoring it, she dashed toward the resuscitation room.
“Grandma! Grandma!” In her heart, she called out to her grandma, yet her voice failed her.
She arrived slightly too late. By the time she reached the resuscitation room, the gurney had been wheeled into it.
Noah awaited Sadie’s reply, but with her phone having fallen, all he could make out was indistinct noise, Sadie’s voice absent. His brow creased deeply.
“Sadie? Sadie?” he repeated into the phone. There was silence from her end.
“Samuel? Where is Sadie?” Noah urgently inquired.
Samuel glanced at the clock and reported, “Mr. Wall, the bodyguards have escorted Mrs. Wall to the hospital. I believe she’s still there.”

“To the hospital!” Noah commanded.
Noah raced into the hospital and immediately noticed Sadie sitting outside the resuscitation room. She was slumped in a chair, her body trembling, her eyes red and swollen. She gripped something tightly in her hand. Seeing her like this twisted Noah’s heart with pain.
He was about to approach and inquire about the situation when the resuscitation room doors swung open. An exhausted doctor stepped out and removed his mask, his face etched with sorrow.
“I’m sorry, ma’am, but we did everything we could,” he said, his voice laden with regret. “Mrs. Stewart suffered massive internal bleeding. Despite our efforts, she didn’t survive. If she had been brought here 20 minutes earlier, there might have been a chance. Unfortunately, it was too late.”
Sadie stood up quickly, but her legs, weakened by prolonged sitting and overwhelming grief, failed her, and she stumbled. Noah quickly stepped in to support her.
However, Sadie pushed him away forcefully, as if jolted by an electric shock. Tears streamed down her face as she moved toward the resuscitation room.
Inside, a body was concealed under a white sheet. With shaking hands, Sadie slowly drew back the sheet. Beneath it lay Laura, her kind face now still.
“Grandma!” Overcome with grief, Sadie collapsed beside the bed, weeping uncontrollably. Laura had been her sole support after the death of her parents. Now, with her grandmother also gone, the shock was too much for Sadie, and she fainted.
“Sadie!” Noah caught her just in time, holding her close.
Her body was unnaturally cold, as if all life had left her, and Noah’s heart ached intensely. He lifted her up and turned to Samuel.

###Chapter 614:
“Find out exactly what happened!”
“Yes, Mr. Wall,” Samuel responded, quickly moving to carry out the orders.
As darkness fell over the hospital, in a silent room, Sadie slowly opened her eyes to the stark white ceiling above. Her mind was blank, her memory frozen at the moment before she had fainted. Grandma!
She sat up suddenly. Noah was beside her, resting in a chair. The noise woke him, and he turned to look at her.
Ignoring the pain that racked her body, Sadie leapt from the bed, anxious. “Where’s Grandma? How is she?”
She fixed Noah with a hopeful gaze, as if expecting him to reassure her, “Your grandma is fine,” so she could cling to that belief.
“I had a dream that my grandma didn’t make it,” Sadie whispered, tears gathering. “That’s not true, right? My grandma is still alive, isn’t she?”
Noah remained silent, his expression unreadable, laden with emotions Sadie couldn’t decipher.
The light in her eyes faded, and tears began to fall.
“Say something! Tell me, my grandma is still alive, right? I can’t believe it. I refuse to believe Grandma has died. I need to see her.” Sadie’s emotions unfurled like a tightly wound spring suddenly released.
She broke free from Noah’s hold and dashed toward the door. Noah, taken aback, instinctively chased after her, catching her from behind.
“Sadie, calm down. Listen to me! You still have me, and I’ll always be here for you.”
He paused, his voice pleading. “Sadie, please, try to calm down. Alright?”
“I don’t want to hear it. I don’t want to hear anything. Let go of me! I need to see Grandma!” Sadie shouted, her voice raw.

Her mind was consumed by a single thought. She had to see her grandmother; she refused to accept Laura was gone. Just days earlier, Laura had been full of life, asking what Sadie wanted for dinner, promising to make her favorite pot roast.
How could death have parted them so abruptly?
Tears streamed down Sadie’s face.
Just then, the door burst open. Samuel entered.noveldrama
“Mr. Wall!” he began, then halted, taking in the scene.
He hadn’t expected Sadie to be awake. Noah caught his eye and subtly signaled for him to leave. Understanding, Samuel quietly exited, closing the door softly behind him.
After what seemed like an eternity, Sadie’s sobs began to subside.
Sadie broke free from Noah’s embrace and wiped her tears. She couldn’t allow herself to fall apart. She believed Laura wouldn’t want to see her this way. Gathering her strength, she walked out of the hospital room, step by step. Noah, feeling as if his heart were tearing, followed her at a distance. Samuel waited outside, visibly anxious.
Noah approached him, his voice rough. “What’s going on?”
Samuel looked troubled and lowered his head, his tone laden with guilt. “Mr. Wall, it’s my fault. I was careless. Please, punish me.” Noah’s expression hardened, signaling for Samuel to continue.
“When we left to meet Miss Wade today, the taxi carrying Mrs. Stewart followed us. I checked the surveillance on the road where the accident occurred, but it had long been out of service. Nevertheless, the driver involved has turned himself in.” Noah’s eyes narrowed, urging him on.
.

###Chapter 615:
Samuel steadied his voice and continued, “The driver said at the moment of the accident, he saw a woman push Mrs. Stewart onto the road. He failed to stop the car in time. From his description, it seems the woman who pushed Mrs. Stewart was Miss Wade.”
A flash of intense fury crossed Noah’s face. “Where is she?” he demanded.
Samuel shivered, quickly replying, “After the incident, Miss Wade went back to her old apartment. She’s now detained.” Noah’s face darkened further. He had not anticipated such a turn of events.
“Don’t tell Sadie yet. She’s been through enough. We’ll talk about this later.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall.”
Noah turned to walk away, just as the elevator doors opened nearby. Alex and Stan stepped out. Alex had hurried to the hospital after hearing about Laura’s accident and accidentally caught the tail end of Noah’s conversation with Samuel.
“Mr. Howe, do you think Mr. Wall will choose Miss Wade or Miss Hudson this time?” Stan asked cautiously.
Alex’s brows knitted together tightly. He stopped and turned around. “Sadie shouldn’t be kept in the dark.” Three years earlier, Sadie had been emotionally scarred and humiliated because of Noah and Kyla. Alex was determined not to let her suffer further harm.
“Find a way to bring Kyla out,” he commanded.
Stan hesitated, his expression troubled. “Mr. Howe, explaining this to Mr. Wall might be challenging.”
Alex clenched his fists, his voice growing cold. “We don’t have time for hesitation.” If Noah was planning anything against Sadie, Alex would prevent it. For Sadie, he was prepared to take any action necessary.
“Alright, Mr. Howe. I’ll take care of it immediately.” Stan quickly nodded, deciding not to protest further.noveldrama
In the hospital morgue, Sadie stood by the mortuary bed, looking at Laura, who appeared to be sleeping peacefully. This brought her a slight comfort. With trembling hands, she placed the white magnolia pendant on Laura’s chest.

“Grandma, don’t worry. I’ll take good care of Averi and myself. Please rest in peace,” she whispered, biting her lip as she vowed, “I will find out who did this to you and make them pay.”
“Laura, rest assured. I’ll look after Sadie.” A voice suddenly broke the silence. It was Noah. He approached and stood next to Sadie.
She ignored him.
“Will you really take good care of Sadie, Mr. Wall?” Alex’s voice echoed in the room before he appeared. Striding in, he confronted Noah. “If you truly care about Sadie, why protect the murderer?”
At those words, Sadie spun around, her expression one of shock as she instinctively stepped back from Noah. Noah’s face darkened immediately. He glared at Alex, warning sharply, “Stop spreading lies, Alex!”
“Am I wrong?” Alex retorted with a sneer.
The room seemed to spin around Sadie. She leaned against the wall for support. “What has happened?”
Noah reached for her hand, his voice urgent. “Sadie, you’re distressed. Let’s discuss this later, okay?” But Sadie was resolute. She yanked her hand away.
“I can’t wait. Grandma’s death is shrouded in mystery. I need to know the truth now.”
.

###Chapter 616:
Sadie paused, struggling to steady her emotions. “The doctor mentioned a passerby on Belleley Road found my grandma and called for an ambulance. Why would she be there, all alone in the middle of nowhere? Who would do such a thing to her?”noveldrama
Noah realized he could no longer withhold the truth from Sadie. “It was Kyla.”
Sadie’s body tensed, her eyes widening in shock. In an instant, she turned, poised to run out. She was determined to make Kyla pay for this.
Noah acted quickly, grabbing her and pulling her back into his arms. He held her tightly, leaving no room for escape. “Sadie, please calm down! I promise, I’ll make this right.”
“Noah, will you protect her again?”
With all her might, Sadie pushed him away and slapped him across the face. She stumbled backward, tears streaming down her face. The sting in her palm paled in comparison to the agony tearing through her heart.
She faced Noah, her eyes brimming with disappointment. How absurd! She had once naively believed—foolishly hoped—that he would change for her. But he hadn’t. He never would. Kyla would always be his priority.
Her voice shook with anger. “My grandma is dead! Do you understand? She’s gone! An eye for an eye—that’s the only justice now!”
Noah was momentarily taken aback, about to respond, but Alex intervened. “My team is already on their way to get Kyla. Sadie, trust me, she won’t escape justice.”
Sadie looked at Alex intently, then turned and walked away. She didn’t need anyone else to seek vengeance for her grandmother; she would handle it herself. Alex followed her immediately.
But as they exited the hospital morgue, a group of men in black suits quickly surrounded them. Clearly, this was Noah’s doing.
Noah emerged slowly, his expression inscrutable.
Every story starts at g ? ln σ ν s, com
Sadie faced him, disbelief in her eyes. Was he really going to stop her? Was he intending to confine her again?
“Kyla won’t escape the consequences. The law will deal with her. But you, Sadie—you can’t ruin your life over her.”
Noah raised his hand slightly, signaling to the bodyguards. “Take her home. She needs to rest.”
Sadie was led away, her movements devoid of energy.
Noah’s expression hardened as he turned to Alex.
“And you—if you act recklessly again, I guarantee the Howe family won’t recover.”
Alex’s face tightened slightly.
Noah strode past him, not looking back.
As he walked, he issued another order. “Arrange Mrs. Stewart’s funeral. Ensure it honors her wishes.”
“Yes, Mr. Wall,” the bodyguards replied immediately, springing into action.
Once in the car, Noah leaned back, closed his eyes, and pinched the bridge of his nose.
After a long silence, he spoke, his voice icy. “Take me to Beresrett Apartments.”
The driver paused briefly but then started the car.
At Beresrett Apartments, Kyla was under house arrest, surrounded by several bodyguards in the living room. Their presence was oppressive.
The memory of the earlier bloody incident replayed in Kyla’s mind.

###Chapter 617:
She trembled, cold sweat running down her back.
“It wasn’t my fault! That old woman was careless! I just gave her a little push!”noveldrama
She repeated this mantra, hoping to convince herself, but fear gnawed at her from within.
Bang! Suddenly, the door burst open with a loud bang. Kyla screamed, nearly falling from the sofa.
It was Noah!
Her eyes sparkled with hope. She scrambled toward him, desperate. But before she could reach him, the bodyguards blocked her way. Noah advanced, an overwhelming presence.
An aura of authority surrounded Noah. His gaze was dark, intensely cold. Kyla had never seen him like this.
For the first time, she felt genuine fear.
“Noah! Please, you have to believe me! I didn’t kill her! She fell on her own!”
Kyla was pinned down on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, her face a mess of tears and snot.
In the past, Noah had always been swayed by her tears.
But now, he only looked down at her with cold detachment.
Kyla’s desperation peaked.
She struggled, but the bodyguards kept her firmly pinned.
“Noah, don’t you believe me?”
Kyla screamed in desperation, pointing at the window.
“I’ll end it all right here. I have a heart condition; the doctor said I wouldn’t live long.”
Every story unfolds at gα?ησν?s．
She moved towards the window, making a false move as if to jump.
Noah observed her with a cold, mocking smile.
“Go ahead. Jump!” he drawled.
Kyla paused, her gaze fixed outside the window, her legs shaking. High above the ground, she knew she couldn’t really jump; she was merely trying to frighten Noah.
She collapsed to her knees with a loud thud, crawling to Noah’s feet. Her tears fell freely as she clung to his leg.
“Noah, I was wrong. I’m terribly sorry. Please, I beg you to spare me, for the sake of our past.”
But before she could finish her plea, Noah bent down swiftly, his eyes fierce, and seized her by the throat.
Kyla’s eyes widened in shock, her face turning purple as she gasped for air.
Her legs kicked out in panic, her hands flailing.
Noah’s expression was one of sheer menace, and Kyla was filled with terror.
At that critical moment, Samuel entered, oblivious to the scene before him.
“Mr. Wall, all of Howe’s men have been captured. They’re in the underground parking lot. What’s the plan?”
Noah paused, then roughly pushed Kyla aside.
He turned slowly, his gaze cold and slightly impatient. “Send them back to where they came from.”
Samuel nodded. “Understood, Mr. Wall.”

###Chapter 618:
As he turned to leave, he cast a glance at Kyla, who lay on the floor, a mix of emotions crossing his face. He exited swiftly to execute the orders.
“Ahem… Ahem… Ahem…”
Kyla coughed violently, each breath feeling like a battle for life.
Her body shook, and tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.
It took her moments to regain her breath fully.
Looking up at the unfeeling man standing over her, Kyla pleaded once more, “Noah, please! Spare me! I promise to leave this instant and never return…”
Her voice was raspy and weak.
Noah looked down at her, his eyes devoid of any warmth, filled only with contempt.noveldrama
“Confessing is your only chance for redemption. Otherwise, no one can help you.”
Kyla shuddered violently, her reluctance palpable.
She feared the ruin of her life, dreading the confines of a prison. Overwhelmed by fear, she saw no escape from the heartless man before her.
Suddenly, she erupted into hysterical laughter. “Confess? Seriously? Noah, stop pretending to be the good guy. You’re behind all of this.” Kyla lifted her head and glared at Noah with intense hatred.
“If anyone’s guilty, it’s you! You pushed all the blame onto me, hoping to cover your crimes? Three years ago, without your indulgence, would I have even had the chance to harm that bitch Sadie?” she screamed, her voice heavy with resentment.
“As soon as I returned from abroad, I already found out you had fallen in love with that bitch. I couldn’t face it then… Now, with Sadie’s grandmother gone—karma. She got what she deserved. She tried to steal what was rightfully mine. Without her meddling, I would have been your wife.”
As she spoke, Kyla became increasingly agitated, losing all composure.
“I wish she were dead too! Dead! They should all go to Hell!”
Her laughter turned maniacal, her voice sharp and unhinged. Noah observed the hysterical woman, his expression dark and menacing. He clenched his fists, his body shaking as he fought to control his emotions.
He turned to the bodyguards, his voice measured but firm. “No need to have her turn herself in. Take her to Boxing Street in Wheosia. Let her fend for herself there.”
The bodyguards’ eyes widened in disbelief.
Boxing Street in Wheosia?
It was a notorious slum, a haven for the most unsavory characters.
Sending Kyla there was tantamount to a death sentence.
“No! Noah, you can’t do this to me! You can’t!”
Kyla’s eyes widened with terror at Noah’s command. She screamed,
“Noah, I saved your life before. You can’t be so cruel and ungrateful.”
The two bodyguards were tall and broad-shouldered, but judging by the veins bulging on their arms, it was clear they were exerting considerable strength just to detain Kyla.
Even so, she continued to struggle, twisting and flailing while shouting obscenities. Her behavior was a far cry from her usual gentle and delicate image.
Noah paid no attention to her cries. He simply turned and walked away.
“No, don’t! Noah, you can’t do this to me!” Kyla wailed in utter despair, her voice hoarse yet piercing at the same time.
.
.
.
###Chapter 619:
But Noah never spared her a backward glance, and soon enough, he was out of sight.
Deflated, Kyla was ultimately dragged away by the bodyguards.
Moments later, Noah entered his house and was greeted by a frantic-looking Breck.
“Sir, you’re finally back!”
“What happened?” Noah asked, feeling an inexplicable wave of dread washing over him.
Breck hesitated and fiddled with his fingers before saying, “Mrs. Wall has locked herself in her room. She hasn’t eaten or drunk anything ever since she was brought back, and she refuses to answer the door.”
Noah frowned in concern.
“Mr. Wall, what happened to Mom?”
A soft, innocent voice suddenly rang out.
Standing at the top of the stairs, Averi was clutching a dinosaur doll, his eyes wide with innocence.
Noah’s heart immediately softened. He walked over with a sigh and knelt in front of the little boy.
“Don’t worry, Averi. Mom is just a little tired and wants to rest. How about we do puzzles later?”
“Okay!” Averi lit up in an instant. He ran off, still hugging his precious toy.
Noah’s expression turned somber as he straightened and turned to Breck.
“Tell the kitchen staff to prepare some of Sadie’s favorite dishes —light ones. Send them up as soon as they’re ready. Also, let her know that Mrs. Stewart’s funeral is scheduled for the day after tomorrow.”
Breck nodded and went to carry out his instructions.

Left alone, Noah could only stare at the closed door of the master bedroom.
Frustration came over him.
Meanwhile, inside the room in question, the atmosphere was dark and oppressive.
Sadie was curled up on the bed, clutching a photo tightly against her chest. It was a picture of her and her grandmother from happier times, before Laura’s health had begun to fail.
Sadie bit her lower lip, desperately trying to hold back her tears, but her body trembled uncontrollably. Regret weighed heavily on her heart. Why had she allowed herself to lose control and marry Noah? If she hadn’t met him, if it hadn’t been for this absurd marriage, would her grandmother still be alive?
A soft knock at the door interrupted her spiraling thoughts.
“Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall asked the kitchen to prepare your favorite glazed chicken and pot roast, along with some warm milk. Please eat something, even if it’s just a little,” Breck’s gentle voice called from outside. “Mr. Wall also mentioned that Mrs. Stewart’s funeral is set for the day after tomorrow.”
There was a long silence. Sadie didn’t respond, lost in her sorrow, until Breck, sensing her hesitation, was about to leave.
The door suddenly opened, and Sadie stood there, her eyes swollen from crying.
“Is Noah back?” she rasped.
“Yes, madam,” Breck replied, his voice caught off guard by her appearance. “Mr. Wall is with Averi.”
Sadie barely registered his words. Without another word, she turned and stormed down the hallway toward Averi’s room. She had to see Noah—she needed to speak with him.noveldrama

###Chapter 620:
Bang!
Sadie flung open the door to Averi’s room. Noah and Averi were sitting on the carpet, laughing together. Averi clumsily stacked blocks under Noah’s patient guidance, his giggles filling the room.
Sadie’s steps faltered as she watched the scene unfold in front of her.
She lingered in the doorway, just staring at them. All her earlier agitation seemed to fade away in an instant, replaced by an overwhelming wave of love for her son.noveldrama
Sadie knew she couldn’t lose control in front of Averi. She couldn’t let him see her weakness, her brokenness.
Sensing her presence, Noah turned his head, his gaze softening as their eyes met.
“Averi,” he said, gently patting the boy’s head. “Your mom and I need to talk. You can finish the blocks by yourself, right?”
Averi nodded obediently and continued playing, unfazed. Noah stood up and walked toward Sadie. Without a word, he took her hand and gently led her into his study.
Sadie offered no resistance, her hands icy cold to the touch.
As soon as the door closed behind them, she spoke, her voice tinged with frustration. “Where is Kyla?”
Noah sighed deeply, his voice low and quiet when he replied, “I had her sent away.”
Sent away?
Sadie’s anger flared once more. She threw her head back and let out a bitter, humorless laugh, her chest rising and falling with the intensity of her emotions.
“Even now, you’re still protecting Kyla!” she exclaimed, her voice trembling with disbelief.
“Is this how you make things right for me?” Sadie demanded, her words sharp, cutting through the air.

Sadie took a step back, putting some distance between herself and Noah.
The words she had spoken pierced Noah’s heart like icy daggers, and he couldn’t help but feel the pang of hurt as he tried to explain. “Kyla—”
But Sadie refused to listen to his excuses. “Noah,” she interrupted, her eyes red-rimmed, her voice trembling. “What exactly am I to you? Does my grandmother’s life count for nothing in your eyes?”
Noah parted his lips to defend himself yet again, but this time, he was at a loss for words.
Ring! Ring! Ring! The sudden, urgent ringing of his phone broke through the tension.
Noah fished it out of his pocket, his brows drawing into a frown when he saw the caller ID. It was from Wall Manor.
He pressed the answer button, and Gabriel’s anxious voice instantly came through the line. “Mr. Wall, your grandfather fainted all of a sudden. He is being rushed to the hospital as we speak.”
Noah’s fingers tightened around his phone. “See. I’m on my way.” His voice was low and thick as he quickly ended the call.
He turned to Sadie with a complicated expression on his face. “Something urgent came up. I need to go. Please rest well. I’ll explain everything when I return, all right?”
Explain? What was there left to explain?
Sadie noted his anxiety and chuckled to herself in bitter irony. She said nothing, though, and simply shot him a look of pure mockery. Noah didn’t speak, either. After giving her one last, deep glance, he rushed out of the study.

###Chapter 621:
Sadie’s hands slowly balled into fists. She presumed that he was running off to Kyla again.
Sadie had long since grown accustomed to such scenarios. No matter the circumstances, Kyla’s calls always seemed to have the power to pull Noah away from whatever he was doing.
Sadie gritted her teeth. What did the time they spent together even mean to that man?
Suddenly overcome with exhaustion, Sadie made her way to Averi’s room.
The boy’s face lit up when he spotted her, and his chubby face broke into a sweet grin. “Mommy, are you here to play with me?”
Sadie settled down beside him and ruffled his hair. “We’re going home, sweetheart.”
Averi blinked at her in confusion. “Home? Aren’t we already home?”
Sadie stared at her son’s innocent expression, and her throat tightened. Still, she fought back the tears and mustered a small smile. “This isn’t our home, honey. Mommy will take you to our real home, okay?”
Averi didn’t quite understand, but he bobbed his head like the good boy he was. “Okay! If you say so, Mommy.”
Breck loitered at the doorway the entire time, repeatedly trying and subsequently failing to speak up. In the end, he could only watch as Sadie finished packing her and Averi’s things, took Averi out of the house, and left in a taxi.
The moment they were out of sight, he grabbed the nearest servant and said, “Hurry and inform Mr. Wall about this!”
“Yes, Mr. Wagner.”
Before long, Sadie’s taxi pulled over at Laura’s apartment building. She stood downstairs for a while, just staring up at the familiar window. At that point, she could no longer hold back, and tears streamed freely down her face.

She took Averi upstairs and unlocked the door. Everything inside was as it had been—worn down, but strangely comforting.
“Mommy, where’s Great-grandma? Why isn’t she here?” Averi suddenly asked, clutching her hand.noveldrama
Sadie stiffened at his questions. She gazed down at her pure son and felt her heart twist inside her chest. How should she go about explaining death to a child?
Sadie wrestled with her emotions for a moment before saying, “Great-grandma has moved to a distant place. It will be a long, long time before we see her again.”
Averi nodded, only partially understanding. “Like when Austin moved to another city?”
Sadie paused and hummed quietly. She proceeded to unpack their things and tidy up the apartment a bit. Once Averi was fast asleep, she walked over to Laura’s favorite rocking chair. She slowly sat down.
The chair creaked gently, as Sadie rocked herself, almost as though her grandmother was still there, humming a tune to lull her to sleep. Sadie closed her eyes, savoring the sense of peace that had eluded her for the longest time. A few stray tears fell from her closed eyes and rolled down her cheeks.
The night deepened, and the rocking of the chair gradually slowed to a stop. Before she knew it, Sadie had fallen asleep.
Meanwhile, Noah had arrived at the private hospital owned by the Wall family.
“How is my grandpa?” he asked, worry etched on his face.
The doctor removed his mask and heaved a heavy sigh. “Mr. Wall, I’m sorry to say that your grandfather has suffered a sudden heart failure. We did our best, but I’m afraid he only has a few days left.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 622:
Noah swallowed the lump in his throat and was silent for a while. “Keep this news under wraps for now. Tell Samuel to keep an eye on the family branch in Zupren.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall.”
With that, the doctor took his leave, and Noah stepped into the hospital room.
Nigel had an oxygen mask on, the shadow of mortality looming over his hospital bed.
“Grandpa,” Noah called out softly as he sat by the bed and took the old man’s hand.
Nigel slowly opened his eyes. “You’re here, Noah.” His voice was so weak, it was barely audible. “And where’s Sadie?”
Noah’s eyes flickered. He bowed his head to avoid his grandfather’s gaze. “Sadie hasn’t been feeling well lately. I thought it would be best to let her stay home and rest.”
Nigel peered at him for a few seconds, then sighed.
“Noah!” he chided, his voice suddenly clearer, louder. “You must take good care of Sadie. Her grandfather was a benefactor to the Wall family. I have already failed him; you must not do the same to Sadie.”
Nigel’s voice rang out with authority, and he spoke each word with great emphasis.
Noah’s heart sank. His mind drifted back to three years ago.
At the time, Kyla had just returned from abroad, and she had accused Sadie of spreading rumors overseas to ruin her reputation, allegedly because of jealousy. Out of the debt he owed Kyla, Noah had always sought to take care of her, often at Sadie’s expense. He had neglected Sadie all those times, only for Kyla to conspire with Ryder to kill Sadie.
Noah’s expression darkened at that last thought. He took a deep breath and squared his shoulders, as if he had come to an important decision. “You have nothing to worry about, Grandpa. I will take good care of Sadie. I will never let her suffer any grievances in this lifetime ever again.”
Nigel studied him for a moment before nodding in relief. Then he smiled, as if he were finally letting go of a long-held burden. “Good! That’s very good to know.”

In the days that followed, it seemed as though Noah had disappeared from the face of the earth. Sadie took care of all the funeral preparations on her own, relying on nothing but sheer determination.
She had lost some weight, and her eyes were constantly red at the corners, but she hadn’t shed another tear so far.
At the funeral, Alex came by, his concern clear from the start. “I offer my condolences, Sadie,” he said softly, his voice kind and gentle as ever. “I hope you find peace amidst your loss.”
When Sadie looked at him, her eyes were vacant and distant. “Thank you, Alex.”
Seeing her like this broke his heart. Alex wanted to gather her into his arms and offer some comfort, but he stopped himself at the last second. He didn’t want to make her uncomfortable.
“If you need help with anything, just let me know. Don’t try to carry it all by yourself.”
“I’m fine,” Sadie replied. “Truly.” No matter how generous Alex was, she didn’t want to burden him with her problems. More importantly, she didn’t want to owe anyone anything.noveldrama
“Thank you for coming to see my grandma. You must be busy with work matters. You should head back.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 623:
Sadie was no longer looking at Alex, and her voice was hushed. She was dismissing him.
Sure enough, she brushed past him without waiting for a response, never looking back.
Alex’s emotions roiled inside him.
Once the funeral was over, Sadie went to the Social Security Bureau alone to handle the termination of her grandmother’s social security benefits.
When she left less than an hour later, she headed to her grandma’s apartment in a daze.
She was approaching the building when a familiar figure caught her eye: Samuel.
He seemed to have spotted her at the same time, as he immediately walked up to her.
“Mrs. Wall…” Samuel began, only to trail off, as if weighing his next words.
Not that it mattered to Sadie. She ignored him entirely and didn’t even break her stride as she continued walking.
“Mrs. Wall!” Samuel called out, his tone urgent this time.
That finally made Sadie pause, though she didn’t bother to turn around.
“Mrs. Wall, Mr. Wall has been preoccupied with very important matters these past few days. Hence, his absence at Mrs. Stewart’s funeral.” There was a tinge of desperation in Samuel’s voice as he explained. “This apartment is not suitable for you and Averi. Why don’t I arrange for some staff to take care of you and Averi?”
Sadie turned around then, slowly, her face blank. “That won’t be necessary. Tell Mr. Wall to spend all the time he wants with Miss Wade.”
Whatever Noah did or whoever he did it with no longer mattered to her.
“As for Kyla…” Sadie paused, unable to hide the hatred in her eyes. “I will make sure she faces the consequences.”
Feel the thrill on gα?ησν?s?c?m
Samuel wanted to say more, but Sadie had already walked off and soon disappeared from sight.
He sighed heavily to himself. Some things needed to be explained by Mr. Wall himself. Samuel took out his phone and made a call.
“Mrs. Wall is at her grandma’s apartment. Send some people here to watch over her. Tell them to be discreet. It’s imperative that nothing happens to her and her son.”
After giving the instructions, Samuel hung up and left the premises. Meanwhile, Sadie had already reached her floor and opened the door to the apartment.
She padded into the living room. Everything was just as it should be. However, her grandmother would never sit there again, smiling at her with a greeting. “You’re home, Sadie!”
Sadie’s nose stung as the tears she had been holding back finally broke loose. She slid to the floor, where she crumpled into herself, hugging her knees and burying her face in her arms.
“Grandma, I miss you,” she whispered in between sobs.noveldrama
As she mourned her grandmother’s death, her phone rang.
Sadie wiped her face and took it out of her purse. The screen displayed an unknown number.
“Is this Miss Hudson? My name is Xavier Hobbes, from the detective agency. We’ve made some progress on your case. When are you available to meet up?”
Shortly after Laura’s incident, Sadie had reached out to a private detective agency and hired them to investigate Kyla’s whereabouts.

###Chapter 624:
Sadie steeled herself and replied, “This afternoon at three, the Wiffenk Diner.” It was a restaurant she used to frequent with her grandmother.
“I’ll see you then, Miss Hudson.”
When Sadie hung up, she was filled with a renewed sense of determination. No matter what it took, she had to find Kyla.
Three o’clock. The Wiffenk Diner.
Sadie caught sight of Xavier as soon as she entered the restaurant. He had settled on a window seat. He saw her at the same time and quickly got to his feet.
“Good afternoon, Miss Hudson.”
Sadie was silent as she took her seat and studied the man in front of her.
Without wasting any time, Xavier produced a stack of documents from his bag and placed them on the table.
“I understand how you must be feeling at the moment, Miss Hudson, but there are some things you need to see for yourself.”
Sadie’s eyes fell on the papers, but she made no move to pick them up. “Where is she?” she asked bluntly.
She wasn’t interested in any long-winded condolences. All she wanted to know was Kyla’s location.
Xavier sighed. “I sincerely apologize, Miss Hudson. We haven’t found the target yet.”
As if sensing her displeasure, he quickly changed his tone. “But we have uncovered some information about Kyla’s past that might prove useful to you.”
Sadie nodded slightly, prompting him to continue.
Xavier rifled through the report and pulled out a handful of photos, which he handed to her.
The place for great stories: g?lnσνs?com
“Six years ago, Kyla went abroad and got involved with someone named Ryder Clifford. According to our investigation, Ryder was responsible for the car accident you had three years ago. He’s dead now, and the last person he saw was Kyla.”
Sadie stared at the pictures of the man with a menacing face. Her fingers tightened around the photos.
So, it was all Kyla’s doing.
Not only had she caused Laura’s death, but she had actually attempted on Sadie’s life before.noveldrama
“What else did you discover?” Sadie asked.
Xavier produced a few more photos and a document.
“There is also the matter from ten years ago involving Mrs. Wall, Noah’s mother. Mrs. Wall was swindled and lost a large sum of money. Kyla helped her win the lawsuit and get ample compensation. In truth, however, Kyla orchestrated everything from the start.”
A look of irony crossed Sadie’s eyes. If Kyla had dared to commit murder, what wouldn’t she have dared to do? It was likely because of that fake scam that Isabel’s attitude toward Kyla had changed.
“Rest assured, Miss Hudson, we are doing everything we can to find Kyla.” Xavier gave her an apologetic look before rubbing his hands together. “Anyway, about the expenses…”
Sadie wordlessly pulled a thick envelope out of her purse and placed it on the table. “Please keep our transaction confidential.”
Xavier quickly pocketed the money, his lips curling into a broad smile. “Of course, Miss Hudson. That goes without saying. I am very discreet with my operations.”

###Chapter 625:
Sadie stood up and left without responding.
She had been busy with matters concerning Laura in the past few days, so she had hired a caregiver for Amy. That morning, the caregiver had called to say that Amy was out of danger and had been moved to a regular hospital room.
Sure enough, Sadie found Amy sitting up on the hospital bed, flipping through a design magazine. Amy looked up at the sound of the door opening.
“You’re here, Sadie,” she said, beaming.
“How are you feeling, Amy? Any better?” Sadie asked with concern as she took the seat by the bed.
Amy’s sigh was laced with disappointment. “I’m all right now. I just never expected Vivi to do such a thing.”
“Don’t dwell on it. You’ll only stress yourself out. It’s all in the past.” Sadie didn’t want her to worry about these things anymore.
“I heard from the nurse that it was Mr. Wall who found the best surgeon to operate on me,” Amy remarked. “Please thank him on my behalf.”
Sadie was momentarily taken aback by that. “I will do,” she replied, somewhat evasively.
“And how are the designs for Zoe coming along?” Amy asked, shifting the topic to work.
Despite being overwhelmed by recent events, Sadie had still managed to make some initial revisions on the drafts for Zoe’s jewelry.
“Please rest assured,” Sadie said. “I won’t hold up any progress on this project.”
Amy looked at her, belatedly noticing her pale complexion and the dark circles under her eyes. Clearly, the poor girl wasn’t resting well. After some hesitation, Amy started to say, “Sadie, you—”
“I need to go and pick up Averi from school now. Please take care of yourself, Amy.” Sadie seemed to have sensed her concern and quickly took her leave before Amy could voice her worries.
L?t?st chαpt?rs in glnovels.
The Wall family had just wrapped up Nigel’s funeral. The vast hall was nearly empty, with just a few relatives loitering near the entrance.
“This is all Sadie’s fault. She’s a black mark on the family, I tell you! It wasn’t enough for her to bring misfortune upon the Hudson family; she just had to bring it to Nigel too,” Isabel was standing before the coffin, ranting on and on with a look of disdain on her face. She dabbed at her eyes as she spoke, though she didn’t appear particularly upset by Nigel’s death.
“Nigel was so fond of that woman when he was alive, but she didn’t even come to see him one last time. That ungrateful wretch!”noveldrama
Noah stood a few steps behind Isabel, his face dark and ominous. “Say one more word, and you’ll return to the estate in the suburbs.” Isabel harrumphed. She knew Noah had long since been bewitched by that vixen, Sadie.
She held back her words, however, and only said after a while, “Do you know where Kyla is? I haven’t seen her lately.”
Instead of answering, Noah silently approached his grandfather’s coffin and bowed three times. Then he turned and left the hall without another glance at his mother.
A car was already waiting for him in the driveway. Once settled in the backseat, Noah rubbed his temples and asked, “How is Sadie?”
“Her bodyguards just reported back that she’s headed to the kindergarten to pick up Averi,” Samuel answered from the passenger seat.
“All right.” Noah waved his hand—a silent instruction to the driver to take them to the kindergarten.
.

.
###Chapter 626:
Then he leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes, relishing the brief respite.
“You need a break, Mr. Wall. You’ve been dealing with your grandfather’s funeral and other family matters these past few days. Perhaps you should head back to Myrtlewood Estate for now?” Samuel suggested, his concern evident in his tone.
How could one man, even one as strong as Noah, endure so much strain in such a short time?
Noah opened his eyes. “Fine,” he said coldly. “Any news about the Quinn and Olson families?”
“The Quinn family has filed for bankruptcy, while the Jenkins family launched an attack on the Olson family. Anson disappeared in the aftermath, and now most of the Olson family’s assets have fallen into the hands of the Jenkins family.”
Noah hummed his approval.
At the entrance of the international kindergarten, Averi, with a tiny backpack on his back, darted through the gates. “Mommy!” he cried out as he launched himself into his mother’s embrace.
Sadie caught him and stroked his head. “Let’s go home, sweetheart.” Mother and son walked down the pavement hand in hand.
They soon reached a less crowded area, and just as Sadie was about to ask Averi what he wanted for dinner, a disheveled woman suddenly charged at them from the alley. She was brandishing a small kitchen knife, aimed directly at Sadie’s chest.
“Go to hell, Sadie Hudson!” the woman screeched, her voice filled with a frenzied hatred.
Sadie’s eyes flashed.
Her body reacted instinctively, and before she even knew it, she had pulled Averi behind her.

Before the blade could even come close, however, a group of black-clad bodyguards emerged from the shadows and subdued the assailant. It all happened so fast that it hadn’t even occurred to Sadie to fear the situation.
It wasn’t until the danger had passed that she realized her body was trembling.
“It’s all right, Averi. We’re all right. We’re safe now.”
The little boy looked terrified as he clung to his mother’s neck. He was shaking as well, and his eyes were filled with tears, though he did his best to keep them from falling.
With an aching heart, Sadie soothed Averi as best as she could. “You did well, darling. You’re such a good boy. Mommy will buy you some candy later. How does that sound?”
Once he had calmed down and Sadie had made sure that he wasn’t hurt, she gently set Averi down. He obediently nodded when she told him to stay put.
Then, Sadie faced her attacker, only to realize that the crazed woman before her was none other than Vivi.
The bodyguards had her pinned to the ground, but she continued to writhe and scream. “You need to die, Sadie! You bitch!”
Sadie scoffed and shook her head. She had no idea what she could have done to Vivi to garner this much loathing.
“Please keep your distance, Mrs. Wall,” one of the men warned her.
“This woman has obviously lost her mind.”
“She’s out of her wits; how much harm could she possibly do me?” Sadie countered in a mocking tone.
Needless to say, the remark provoked Vivi further, and she struggled even harder.

###Chapter 627:
“Stop acting like you’re better than me! You are always competing with me, fighting for everything, even back at Majestic Ego!” Her voice was painfully grating as she continued to berate Sadie. “You are always favored by Amy! You had nothing to your name! You were a nobody! Why did you get to marry Noah while I was forced into a disgusting marriage?! Anson is a complete monster!”
With the way Vivi talked, she truly believed her circumstances were all Sadie’s fault.
Sadie just watched her outburst in silence, her eyes slowly going blank and emotionless. “Do you really think marrying Noah is such a blessing, Vivi? What kind of blessing would rip away your loved ones, leaving you battered and bruised?”
“Quit pretending to be pitiful, you two-faced bitch!” Vivi spat out, thinking that Sadie was flaunting her marriage.
Sadie sighed. She couldn’t be bothered to waste any more time with Vivi, so she turned to the bodyguards and said, “Please take her to the police station.”
“Yes, Mrs. Wall.”
As the bodyguards hauled Vivi to her feet, she suddenly managed to break free. She lunged forward, grabbing Sadie by the collar. “If I’m going down, then I’m taking you with me!”
Vivi’s laughter rang out, wild and untamed, carrying a reckless determination. The bodyguards’ expressions shifted abruptly as they surged forward to restrain her.
Amidst the chaos, the sharp screech of tires echoed nearby.
A sudden realization struck Sadie—Averi was still at the roadside, and Vivi’s attention was locked on him.
“Averi!” Sadie’s desperate cry tore through the air.
With an unexpected surge of strength, she sent Vivi sprawling. Almost at the same moment, a car hurtled toward Averi, seconds away from disaster.

Sadie’s legs faltered—she wanted to reach him, but time was against her.
Before she could move, a blur shot past, shielding the boy from harm.noveldrama
It was Noah.
He shoved Averi aside but bore the full impact himself. His body was flung through the air before crashing onto the pavement. Blood immediately pooled beneath him. Sadie clutched Averi, too stunned to react, until the soft sound of the child’s sobs snapped her back to reality.
“Noah!”
Her emotions spilled over uncontrollably.
She lowered Averi gently and sprinted toward Noah, who lay motionless in a pool of blood.
“Noah, wake up! Don’t do this to me!” She dropped to her knees beside him, her hands hovering, unsure where to touch.
Tears streamed down her face. His eyes remained shut, his complexion ashen, his chest frighteningly still.
“Look at me! You can’t leave like this. You owe me an explanation!” Her voice broke with anguish.
Despite her earlier resentment, the sight of him sacrificing himself for Averi shattered the walls around her heart.
“Mr. Wall!” Samuel rushed over, his face drained of color.
Moments ago, inside the vehicle, Noah had ordered an emergency stop and leaped out without hesitation.
“Get an ambulance! Now!” Samuel barked at the bodyguards, his senses snapping back into place.
.

###Chapter 628:
If anything happened to Noah, he would never forgive himself.
The guards, momentarily frozen in fear, scrambled to make the call.
The operating room’s red light flickered on.
Sadie collapsed onto the cold floor, her vision blurred by tears. Memories flooded her mind—her grandmother had been taken behind those very doors, never to return.
“It’ll be okay. It has to be,” she told herself, though her entire body trembled.
She bit her lip hard, trying to stifle the sobs racking her chest.
The hospital bustled with hurried footsteps and murmured voices.
Sadie remained motionless, disheveled and hollow.
Nearby, Samuel watched her in silence, uneasy at her distress.
He wanted to offer comfort but couldn’t find the words.
A piercing voice shattered the tension. “You again, you wretched woman!” Isabel stormed toward them, her face ashen, eyes red-rimmed from weeping.
Her fury ignited at the sight of Sadie sitting there, and without hesitation, she slapped her hard across the face.
Sadie’s cheek burned instantly.
Isabel pointed an accusatory finger, her voice hoarse with rage. “You ruin everything you touch! Was destroying your own family not enough? Now you’ve dragged Noah into this. If anything happens to him, I swear you’ll pay.”
Sadie stared blankly at the hysterical woman before her, momentarily unable to react.
Then, her expression turned cold. With a firm shove, she pushed Isabel away. “Mrs. Wall, Noah is the reason the person responsible for my grandmother’s death walked free. If not for him, she wouldn’t have died without justice.”
Isabel staggered, nearly collapsing, but a bodyguard steadied her.
Step into new worlds with gα?ησν?sоm
Her face shifted from pale to flushed, her entire body trembling. “That’s a lie! My son would never do something like this. Stop this nonsense!”
Samuel, unable to remain silent, finally spoke up, his voice firm. “Mrs. Wall, you’re mistaken.”noveldrama
“Mr. Wall didn’t let Miss Wade escape. He had her sent to Boxing Street in Wheosia—left to fend for herself.”
Sadie’s breath caught. “What?” Her voice wavered in disbelief.
Could Noah really have done that?
Hadn’t he always shielded Kyla?
The world seemed to tilt, and she pressed a hand against the wall to steady herself.
Samuel exhaled, continuing, “And the reason Mr. Wall left so suddenly during your last encounter… was that his grandfather was critically ill. Today, we finished his funeral. He didn’t tell you because he feared you couldn’t handle more heartbreak.”
“Nigel has passed away?” Sadie felt the last of her strength drain away. She sank to the floor, silent tears spilling down her cheeks.
Sadie sobbed uncontrollably. First, Laura was gone, and then Nigel had also left her. Why did those who cared for her always leave?
Just then, the operating room doors flew open.
A nurse rushed out, clutching a document marked “critical condition.”
“Who here is Noah’s family? Quick, sign this!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 629:
Sadie stumbled forward, her hands shaking so violently that she could barely grip the pen. Her signature was nothing more than a series of jagged lines.
She wanted to ask about Noah’s state, but her throat tightened, making it impossible to speak.
The nurse, seeing no time to waste, turned and disappeared back into the operating room.
The doors swung shut once more.
Sadie lurched forward, but her knees buckled beneath her, sending her crashing to the floor in humiliation. Nearby, Isabel folded her arms, her lips curling in disdain. A sharp laugh escaped her. “How dramatic.” The endless night stretched on.
At last, the operating room doors reopened.
A weary doctor stepped out, removing his mask with a deep exhale.
Isabel’s pulse quickened with fear.
She staggered forward, clutching the doctor’s arm, her voice raw with desperation. “Doctor, my son—how is he?”
The doctor regarded her trembling figure with sympathy. “Mrs. Wall, we did everything possible. Mr. Wall suffered extensive injuries. We managed to stabilize him, but…” His voice grew heavy. “The damage to his central nervous system was severe. The chances of him regaining consciousness are extremely low.”noveldrama
Isabel stood frozen, her mind rejecting his words. Her legs trembled as she nearly collapsed.
“No… That’s not possible! You must be mistaken!”
The doctor lowered his gaze. “To be blunt, he is in a vegetative state.”
Sadie, who had been clinging to the last shred of hope, felt her world shatter.
All hope, all expectations, vanished in that instant.
Her vision blurred, and before she could resist, she lost consciousness, her body collapsing backward.
“Sadie!” Alex rushed forward, catching her just in time.
The weight in his arms was alarmingly light, her body drained of all strength.
Pressing a hand to her forehead, he flinched—she was burning up. Alex’s heart clenched. Without hesitation, he scooped her up and sprinted toward the emergency room.
Isabel remained fixated on her own grief, too consumed to notice anything else. Forcing herself upright, she seized Samuel’s arm. “Samuel, I recall that in Zupren, there’s a highly regarded facility—Rosewood Hospital. They specialize in treating coma patients. Arrange for Noah’s immediate transfer.”
Samuel hesitated briefly. “Madam, should we inform Mrs. Sadie Wall?”
“Shut your mouth!” Isabel snapped, venom flashing in her eyes. “She doesn’t need to know. Just handle it.”
Samuel dared not protest. With a quick nod, he replied, “Understood. I’ll see to it at once.”
He cast a glance toward the emergency room before hurrying away.
Inside the emergency room.
“Mr. Howe, there’s no need to worry. She collapsed due to exhaustion and a high fever. An IV has been administered, and with enough rest, she should regain consciousness soon,” the doctor assured. Alex exhaled slowly, some of the tension easing from his face.
“Alright, you may leave now.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 630:
Once the doctor exited, shutting the door behind him, Alex reached for Sadie’s hand. It was icy to the touch, her fingers twitching as though she was trapped in a nightmare.
“Sadie… As long as you’re safe, that’s all that matters. I should have done more to protect you.”
Hours turned into a full day, yet she remained unresponsive.
A new wave of unease gripped Alex. He sought out the doctor again, his voice betraying his growing fear. “Why hasn’t she woken up? Is something wrong?”
The doctor ran another set of tests, his brows knitting together.
“From all the indicators, the patient is indeed not in any critical condition. Her extended unconsciousness is most likely due to psychological distress.”
“Psychological distress?”
“Yes, it’s a defense mechanism triggered by extreme emotional turmoil. Medication won’t be very effective in this case. The best approach is to surround her with familiar faces and comforting items—something that might encourage her to wake up,” the doctor explained, his tone tinged with helplessness.
Alex froze.
Had Noah’s condition been such a crushing blow to Sadie? Was the weight of it so unbearable that she preferred to remain unconscious rather than face reality?
Suddenly, Alex straightened, realizing that Sadie’s deepest concern had to be Averi.
Without hesitation, he instructed Stan to bring the child over. Averi dashed to the bedside, his tiny voice repeatedly calling, “Mommy,” while tears streamed down his cheeks.
Yet, Sadie remained motionless.
“Alex, what’s wrong with Mommy?” Averi’s worried eyes, reddened from crying, searched Alex’s face.
Let your imagination soar with g?lnσνs?com
A pang of sorrow tightened Alex’s chest. He knelt beside the boy, gently stroking his hair. “Averi, don’t worry. Mommy is just resting. When she wakes up, she’ll play with you again.”
Averi nodded, his small fingers gripping Alex’s coat tightly.
“I’ll wait with you until Mommy wakes up.”
Sadie remained unconscious, her face contorted with distress.
In the depths of her mind, only darkness existed.
She ran frantically, searching for a way out, but there was none.
Then, a faint light emerged ahead.noveldrama
She sprinted toward it, clinging to the hope it offered. As it drew nearer, its shape became clearer—a tall figure.
It was Noah.
He stood there, his presence commanding attention, yet distant.
Sadie’s heart pounded. “Noah! Noah!” she called desperately.
But he didn’t react. He remained still, as if unaware of her presence. She rushed forward, reaching for his coat, but her fingers passed through him.
He wasn’t real—just a shadow.
“Noah, please look at me!” she pleaded, her voice cracking with anguish. Slowly, he turned, his gaze cold and unfamiliar, as if she were a stranger.
Then, he stepped back.
“No! Don’t leave me, Noah!” Sadie screamed, chasing after him. But no matter how fast she ran, she couldn’t reach him.
.
.
.
###Chapter 631:
She watched helplessly as he grew more distant, eventually disappearing into the darkness.
Unable to hold on any longer, she collapsed to the ground, sobbing.
“Noah…”
A voice—soft yet familiar—echoed around her.
Suddenly, consciousness returned. The brightness of the hospital room overwhelmed her senses as her eyes fluttered open. Alex, Averi, and Samuel stood at her bedside.
“Mommy! You’re awake!” Averi cried, throwing his arms around her. Samuel exhaled in relief. “Thank goodness, ma’am, you’re awake.”
Sadie blinked, her mind struggling to clear.
Noah had been struck by a car, Nigel was gone, and she had lost consciousness.
As her thoughts slowly pieced themselves together, a sharp pain gripped her chest, making it hard to breathe.
“Where is Noah? How is he?” she asked, her voice unsteady.
Samuel hesitated, seeing the desperation in her pale face. It pained him to say it, but he had no choice.
“Mrs. Isabel Wall arranged for Mr. Wall to be transferred to Rosewood Hospital in Zupren.”
Sadie froze, her entire body going numb.
She knew that facility—it specialized in treating patients in unresponsive states. Was Noah in a vegetative state now?
No! She refused to accept it. She needed to see him, to confirm it herself.
Without thinking, she threw the blankets aside and attempted to stand.

“What are you doing? You’re not strong enough to get up!” Alex moved quickly, blocking her path. Sadie was too shaken to listen.
“Let me go! I have to see him!”
Her legs buckled the moment she tried to move, and she nearly collapsed.
Alex caught her just in time, holding her steady.
“Sadie, you need to stay calm. You’re in no condition to go anywhere.” Samuel stepped in, his expression serious. “Ma’am, even if you try, you won’t be allowed to see him.”noveldrama
“Why not?” Sadie demanded, her voice raw with anguish.
“Rosewood Hospital has strict entry regulations. Only medical personnel are permitted inside—unless Mr. Wall regains consciousness.”
Sadie’s body tensed at those words. Overwhelmed, she slumped against Alex, her strength completely drained.
Sadie squeezed her eyes shut, but the tears wouldn’t stop.
Would she never see Noah again?
Suddenly, as if grasping onto the last thread of hope, she snapped her eyes open and clutched Samuel’s arm. “Take me to Isabel—I have to see her!”
Samuel hesitated, his gaze searching hers. Then, with a firm nod, he agreed. “Alright, come with me.”
The car rolled to a stop in front of Wall Manor.
At first glance, nothing had changed, yet an eerie emptiness lingered in the courtyard, as though the life it once held had faded.
Samuel cut the engine and stepped out, circling the vehicle to open the door for her.
.

###Chapter 632:
Sadie didn’t move right away. She sat frozen, her eyes fixed on the iron gate.
Once, Nigel had always welcomed her with a warm smile. Now, that warmth was gone.
Swallowing the ache in her chest, she forced herself out of the car.
The moment she stepped onto the courtyard, her gaze landed on Isabel. She stood among the servants, issuing orders as they loaded things into the waiting cars.
They were leaving.
The moment Isabel laid eyes on Sadie, her expression darkened, disdain flashing in her gaze.
“What are you doing here?” Her voice was cold, sharp enough to cut through stone.
“Isabel—” Sadie barely managed to choke out the word, her voice quivering with emotion. Her fists trembled at her sides as she stepped forward, desperation propelling her.
She nearly dropped to her knees, ready to beg—to plead for a chance to go to Zupren and care for Noah.
But Isabel was quicker. Anticipating her move, she seized Sadie’s arm before she could kneel and shoved her back with unyielding force.
“Don’t bother.”
A tense pause followed before Isabel’s lips curled into a bitter sneer. “Now you remember Noah? Haven’t you been having a good time with Alex all this time?”
“1 wasn’t—” Sadie tried to explain, frantic, but Isabel cut her off with a scornful glare.
“‘Enough, Sadie. Do you think I’m as naive as Noah? I won’t fall for your act!”
Then, without hesitation, she barked an order. “Someone, get her out of here!”
Newest chapters on galnoνels.cóm
The command sent servants rushing forward. Without mercy, they surrounded Sadie, hands gripping her arms, shoving her back.
“‘Let me go!” Sadie thrashed against their hold, her voice raw with anguish. “‘Isabel, please—please let me go to Zupren! Let me take care of Noah—I’m begging you!”
Her cries were hoarse, desperate.
But Isabel didn’t flinch. Her gaze remained cold. She was unmoved by Sadie’s suffering. She didn’t spare Sadie another glance. Without hesitation, she turned back to the servants, issuing orders with cold detachment.
“Hurry up. Get everything on the cars—we’re leaving now.”
The servants moved swiftly, while Sadie was manhandled out of Wall Manor.
Rough hands shoved her past the threshold, and the heavy iron gate groaned as it swung shut behind her. Her legs gave out. She collapsed onto the cold pavement, despair sinking its claws deep into her chest. Was this truly the end for her and Noah?
Samuel rushed forward, catching her trembling body before she could completely fall apart. His voice was gentle, laced with concern. “Are you alright?”
Sadie didn’t answer. She only nodded her head, her empty gaze fixed on nothing.
Samuel sighed. The wind carried the scent of impending rain, thick and heavy in the air. “It’s about to storm any minute now. Let me take you back to Myrtlewood Estate.”
She offered no resistance, no words—just silent surrender as he helped her into the car.
Myrtlewood Estate.noveldrama
Everything was the same. The familiar walls, the furniture she once shared with Noah, the echoes of their life together—yet now, it all felt hollow.

###Chapter 633:
This was their home.
Now, she was the only one left.
A fresh wave of sorrow crashed over her, and she couldn’t hold it in anymore. Tears spilled down her face, an endless flood of anguish. Why? Why had Noah shut her out completely? Why wouldn’t he tell her anything?
Sadie locked herself in her bedroom. She refused to eat, refused to speak—cutting herself off from the world.noveldrama
Outside, Breck paced anxiously, torn between concern and fear of disturbing her.
He even arranged for her favorite dishes from Nirvana, hoping to coax her out. But she never touched them.
Days passed. Then, one evening, Samuel returned, his face grim as he stood at the door of the master bedroom. He hesitated, then knocked lightly. “Mrs. Wall?” Silence.
He tried again, his voice firmer this time. “Mrs. Wall, since Mr. Wall’s accident, the company has been in chaos.” Still, nothing. No sound. No movement.
Samuel paused briefly before speaking. “Coyle Wall, Mr. Wall’s uncle, has returned with his family and is exploiting Mr. Wall’s absence to seize control of the company.”
His voice carried a sharp urgency. He was fully aware that Sadie was their last hope.
“I realize you’re in pain, but the company is on the brink of ruin.” The silence in the room was heavy.
Samuel’s stomach tightened, fearing that Sadie might refuse to help.
Just as he was ready to give up, the door swung open.
Sadie appeared, her complexion drained, but her eyes burned with resolve.

“What’s happening?” Relief flooded Samuel. At last, she was stepping up. The Wall Group could still be saved.
He quickly relayed the recent developments to her.
Sadie gave a slow nod, swallowing hard, then rasped, “Nigel transferred some shares to me as part of my grandfather’s estate.”
Samuel leaned forward. “Coyle and his family control more shares than we can currently access. To stabilize the situation, there’s only one path left.”
“And what is that?” Sadie demanded.
“We must secure Mr. Wall’s shares,” Samuel whispered, knowing it was a drastic measure.
“That requires Mrs. Isabel Wall’s approval,” he added, dread weighing his tone.
Given Isabel’s prior attitude, persuading her seemed impossible. “Mrs. Isabel Wall leaves for her flight tomorrow, the same day as the shareholders’ meeting. Coyle will make his move then. Tonight is our final opportunity.”
Sadie knew how much Noah valued the company. She couldn’t allow his uncle to dismantle everything in his absence.
“Let’s move.”
Wiping her tears away, she changed into a sharp business suit that radiated authority.
In the mirror, her face was pale, but her gaze burned with unwavering determination.
“We’ll go to the airport hotel where Mrs. Isabel Wall is staying,” Samuel informed her as they hurried out.

###Chapter 634:
Time wasn’t on their side.
But things didn’t go as smoothly as Sadie had hoped.
When they reached the hotel, Isabel’s servant blocked their path.
“Mrs. Wall has no interest in seeing you,” the servant sneered.
Sadie’s jaw clenched.
Without hesitating, she shoved past the servant and stormed inside.
Samuel was right behind her, shielding her from interference.
“Sadie, what’s the meaning of this?”
Isabel, seated on the living room sofa, was furious. “Samuel, are you betraying me too?”noveldrama
Sadie strode forward and slammed a document onto the table.
“This is a share transfer contract.”
Isabel skimmed the paperwork, then exploded.
“Sadie, I never realized you were so ambitious! Noah isn’t even dead, and here you are, scheming for his shares? Coyle, at least, bears our family name. I’d rather entrust the company to him than to an outsider like you!”
Sadie’s heart ached, but she bit back the anger.
Slapping her palm on the table, she hissed, “You’ll sign today, whether you want to or not!”
“How dare you!” Isabel gasped, taken aback by Sadie’s boldness.
With a bitter laugh, Isabel snatched the contract and tore it to shreds.
“Keep dreaming!” Isabel sneered and threw the torn pieces at Sadie. “You’re a disgrace—you betrayed Noah and gave birth to another man’s child. You’re unworthy of his company shares. Walk away!”

Sadie trembled, her face drained of color as years of buried emotion surged forth.
“Averi is Noah’s biological son!” Sadie shouted, her voice hoarse with desperation. “If you don’t believe me, we can do a DNA test.”
The room fell deafeningly silent.
Isabel’s eyes widened, her body swaying slightly as if struck.
Samuel, frozen in place, struggled to process the revelation.
“No… that’s not possible…” Isabel stammered after a long pause, her voice barely audible.
“You’re lying!” Isabel shrieked, panic creeping in. “Averi can’t be Noah’s child!”
Sadie crossed her arms, a cold smile playing on her lips.
“Why not?” she countered icily. “Three years ago, Noah didn’t want this child, so I left the country to protect him. I have proof—Averi’s birth certificate, medical records—all confirming Noah is the father.”
Isabel’s knees buckled as she struggled to stand. Her mind flashed with images of Averi’s innocent face. Could this boy truly be Noah’s son? But she had commissioned a DNA test before, which showed no blood relation between him and Noah—how could that be explained?
Her thoughts spiraled as confusion clouded her eyes.
“That DNA test report was brought to me by Kyla!” Isabel shouted.
“There’s no way it could be forged! You manipulative woman, stop fabricating lies!”
Sadie’s expression darkened, amusement flickering beneath her glare.
“Didn’t Kyla ‘help’ you resolve a sticky situation ten years ago?” Sadie asked, her voice laced with sarcasm. “Didn’t you find it odd that a novice lawyer had the ability to deal with the mob?”

###Chapter 635:
When Isabel heard this, her blood ran cold. Her head snapped up, eyes wide with horror.
“How… how do you know about that?”
The incident from a decade ago had been buried deep. After all, the Wall family had a long-standing aversion to gambling!
Isabel had always believed that incident was a secret shared only between her and Kyla. But now, Sadie was aware of it as well. Isabel found herself wondering how that had happened. Could it be…
As stubborn as Isabel was, her confidence in her previous convictions began to falter. She had always trusted Kyla the most. Was it possible that Kyla had been deceiving her from the very beginning?
Just then, Samuel’s phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID, and his expression shifted before he took the call. “Yes, what is it? I see. All right.”
Samuel hung up and walked over to Isabel. He wasn’t quite sure what he was feeling when he handed her the phone. “Please take a look at this,” he said, his tone grave.
Isabel took the phone with trembling hands. On the screen was a photo of a document that had been torn apart, then pieced back together. Although the writing was somewhat blurred, Isabel recognized it instantly. It was a DNA test report.
Her gaze immediately went to the bottom, her eyes widening in shock. It was right there, plain and simple. “The probability of a parent-child relationship between Averi Hudson and Noah Wall is greater than 99.99%.” And the date of the test was the very same day she had had a paternity test done between Noah and Averi.
Isabel’s body swayed, her knees buckling beneath her. Samuel rushed forward to support her. “Are you okay, Mrs. Wall?” But Isabel didn’t respond. She couldn’t. She was far too lost in her thoughts. Her eyes were still fixed on the report.
What on earth was going on?
Your story hub is g?lnσνs?
Samuel let out a heavy sigh. “I happened to run into Miss Wade at the company one day, and I saw her tearing up this document and tossing it on the ground. I felt that something was off at the time, so I gathered the pieces and had a puzzle expert put them back together. He only just got back to me today.”
Isabel cast a complicated glance in Sadie’s direction, then let out a long, weary sigh. “Do you have another copy of the contract?” Samuel immediately produced a backup contract and handed it over. “Here it is, Mrs. Wall.”
Isabel didn’t bother reading through the terms and went straight to the last page to sign her name. Watching her do this, Sadie didn’t feel the relief she had been expecting. If anything, she only felt a pang of bitter irony. Eventually, she had to reveal Averi’s blood ties with the Wall family in such a ridiculous way.
“We’ll be taking our leave,” Sadie said softly, her voice sounding exhausted. She and Samuel turned to leave.
“Wait!” Isabel suddenly called out, her voice laced with urgency. “I want to see my grandson.”
Sadie did not refuse—she didn’t think she should. “Of course.”
Averi was playing with his building blocks when they arrived home. He immediately ran over at the sound of the door opening and clung to Sadie’s leg. “Mommy!”
Sadie bent slightly and ran her fingers through the boy’s hair, her eyes brimming with affection.
It was then that Averi noticed Isabel standing behind his mother. His eyes went wide with interest. He remembered this woman. She was very pretty, but she seemed to dislike him back then.

###Chapter 636:
Isabel, for her part, gazed at the charming little boy, and felt a comforting warmth slowly spread across her chest. She crouched down so she could meet Averi’s eyes and spoke in a gentle voice, “Hello, Averi. I am your grandmother.”
Now that she had the chance, Isabel studied Averi’s face closely. The more she looked, the more she noticed the similarities he bore with Noah when her son was still a child. Isabel couldn’t help but berate herself for her past foolishness. How could she have fallen for Kyla’s trickery so easily?
Overcome with guilt and regret, she reached out and gathered Averi into her arms.
“I’m sorry, Averi,” Isabel whispered, her voice thick with emotion. Averi had no idea what his grandmother was apologizing for, but he could feel her genuine affection for him.
He raised his tiny hand and touched her face. “Don’t cry, Grandma.”
Isabel could no longer hold her tears back when he said that. Sadie watched Isabel embrace Averi, unsure of what she was feeling herself.
She turned to Samuel and tipped her head toward the study. “Come with me,” she said, her voice tired.
Samuel nodded before trailing after her.
Once inside the study, Sadie settled behind the desk and spoke bluntly. “I need you to prepare a dossier containing detailed information on everyone from Coyle’s family. I’ll be going to the company tomorrow, and I need to know the people I’ll be dealing with.”
Samuel understood her intentions in an instant.
“Copy that, Mrs. Wall. I’ll get right on it.” He excused himself with a respectful bow and exited the study.
Sadie wandered to her bedroom, intending to change her clothes. She had just pulled a beige suit from the wardrobe when the bedroom door creaked open.
Startled, she clutched the clothes to her chest and whipped around. It was Isabel, looking far less cold and arrogant. If anything, she seemed oddly at peace.
gα?ησν?s． brings magic to life
“Do you need something, Isabel?” Sadie asked tentatively.
The older woman nodded in response as she walked into the room and sat on the sofa.
“I’m not leaving, Sadie,” Isabel said, sounding like an entirely different person.
Sadie was so surprised that she nearly dropped her clothes altogether.
Not leaving? What did that mean?
As if reading her mind, Isabel added, “I’m planning to move back to Wall Manor. You’re slated to take over the Wall Group, so you will no doubt be busy. You may not have time to spare for Averi. I’ll stay and help take care of him while you’re busy. I am his grandmother, after all.”
Her tone was calm, but her gaze was earnest and sincere.
For a while, Sadie could do nothing more than stare.
“I’ll take Averi back to Wall Manor tonight,” Isabel said, noticing Sadie’s silence.
Sadie remained quiet for a moment before sighing softly. She had been through a lot recently and was exhausted. Indeed, she didn’t have much energy left to take care of Averi. “Alright,” she nodded, accepting Isabel’s suggestion.
A faint smile appeared on Isabel’s face, signaling her relief. “Take care of yourself as well. Don’t wear yourself out,” Isabel advised with a tone of concern. “As for Noah…”
Her voice dropped, and her expression turned somber. “He’s been admitted to Rosewood Hospital, and I can’t visit him either. Now, all we can do is wait for him to wake up.”

###Chapter 637:
A wave of sadness washed over Sadie. She lowered her gaze, her long lashes veiling the disappointment in her eyes. “I understand.”
Isabel looked as though she wanted to say more but ultimately left the bedroom silently.
Sadie sat by the bed, her hands clenched so tightly her fingertips turned white. When would Noah wake up? She yearned for his embrace, for him to reassure her that everything would be alright. Now, he was lying in a hospital bed, his condition unknown to her.
The buzz of her phone snapped her out of her thoughts. It was an email from Samuel, containing detailed information about Coyle and his family.
Sadie forced herself to concentrate. She couldn’t afford to break down; there was too much at stake. She had to protect Wall Group, safeguard Averi, and await Noah’s recovery.
She opened the document and scrutinized it intently. It wasn’t until dawn that she had committed everything to memory.
After freshening up, Sadie left early for Wall Group. Upon her arrival, Samuel greeted her.
“Good morning, Mrs. Wall,” Samuel said respectfully. “The board meeting won’t start for a while. Would you like to rest in Mr. Wall’s office first?”
Sadie was about to reply when a cheerful voice interrupted. “Sadie! What brings you here?”
It was Tina, who approached quickly, her face radiating happiness. “Sadie, you look fantastic today!” she exclaimed, circling Sadie with genuine admiration.noveldrama
Sadie smiled and playfully pinched Tina’s cheek. “You’re always so sweet.”
Tina scratched her head sheepishly, then leaned in with a secretive air. “Sadie, have you heard? Mr. Wall hasn’t been to the office for days, and people are getting worried. Is something wrong?”
Exclusive content available at g?lnσν?s?com
A wave of concern washed over Sadie. She managed a forced smile and said softly, “Tina, don’t overthink it. Mr. Wall is on a business trip.”
“Really?” Tina seemed skeptical.
“Absolutely,” Sadie replied, feigning ease. “Now, please get back to work and keep focused.”
“Oh. Alright,” Tina said before leaving.
Once Tina was gone, Sadie’s smile disappeared. She knew she needed to stabilize the situation quickly and stop any rumors.
“You are Noah’s wife, right? What brings you to the company today? Shouldn’t you be at home preparing for Noah’s funeral?” A sharp voice suddenly rang out, dripping with sarcasm and hostility.
Sadie turned to see who it was. A middle-aged man with a cane, flanked by some others, was approaching. He was older, with a sullen and arrogant air that made him quite disagreeable.
Sadie recognized him from the files she had studied the night before. He was Coyle Wall, the second son of Nigel, Noah’s uncle.
Accompanying him were his son, Sutton Wall, and his daughter, Briley Wall. Sutton had a refined appearance but a calculating look, while Briley seemed haughty, looking down on Sadie as if she were insignificant.
Sadie suppressed a snort.
This family was evidently making their move.
Sadie stepped forward with a calm smile. “Uncle Coyle, I should be the one asking what brings you here. I can’t believe you’re still this energetic at your age.” Her voice was soft but carried a subtle sting. “And about Noah, surely you aren’t wishing ill on the chairman of Wall Group, are you?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 638:
Briley began to retort heatedly. “You…”
“Briley!” Sutton quickly intervened, his gaze warning her to hold her tongue.
Briley clenched her teeth, glaring at Sadie but remained silent. Coyle was taken aback by Sadie’s composure, and his expression grew stormy. He laughed coldly. “Sadie, you certainly have a sharp tongue. No wonder Noah chose you.” His tone was laden with derision.
With those words, he led his entourage past Sadie, heading toward the elevator.
Sadie’s expression was as cold as steel as she strode toward the elevator. Tina, who had barely taken a step away, stood rooted to the spot. Had she heard that right? Noah’s wife? Coyle had called Sadie Noah’s wife. But wasn’t Noah involved with Kyla? What on earth was happening here?
Tina’s thoughts spun wildly, tangled in a web of unanswered questions. And yet—beneath the confusion—there was a flicker of anticipation, a thrill she couldn’t quite explain. Regardless of the speculation, one fact remained indisputable—Sadie was the company chairman’s wife.
Sadie stepped onto the floor where the conference room was, her quiet determination apparent. As the elevator doors slid open, her gaze landed on the closed conference room door. A murmur of voices filtered through from the other side. Adjusting her attire with a swift, practiced motion, she pushed the door open.
Inside, the room was already brimming with people. Wall Group’s shareholders and top executives filled the space, their hushed whispers swirling like an undercurrent of uncertainty. Their expressions ranged from wary to intrigued.
Without hesitation, Sadie strode to the head of the table, Samuel following just a step behind. Under the weight of countless eyes, Sadie lowered herself into the chair—unshaken, composed.
Her presence radiated authority, her confidence unsettling some of the shareholders and executives, who exchanged curious glances. Some of them knew Sadie’s relationship with Noah, but most of them thought she had been just Noah’s secretary once, and had resigned long ago. How could a mere secretary presume to sit in the president’s chair?
Coyle hadn’t anticipated Sadie to be this audacious. Settled on one side of the conference table, he narrowed his eyes, a flicker of malice in his gaze. This woman was no ordinary pawn.
?αlиσv.cоm has the newest content
Sadie’s gaze swept the room, her fingers drumming lightly against the polished wood.
“Samuel,” she said, her voice smooth and deliberate. “Tell them who I am.”
“Yes, Mrs. Wall,” Samuel responded with quiet reverence before stepping forward.
“Everyone, settle down. The lady before you is Mr. Wall’s legally wedded wife—Mrs. Sadie Wall. Mr. and Mrs. Wall have been married for six years, though it was never made public.”
A collective gasp rippled through the room. Eyes widened. Murmurs swelled into a wave of disbelief.
“Noah was married?” someone whispered.
“And to Sadie?”
The shareholders and executives exchanged whispers, their voices rising in shock.
“Mr. Wall has a wife? Since when?”noveldrama
“They’ve hidden this well—I had no clue.”
“Wasn’t Sadie just his secretary? How could she…”
“This will be a nightmare for Coyle. He won’t take this lightly.”
Coyle’s expression darkened, the corners of his mouth curling into a sneer.
.

###Chapter 639:
“Sadie,” he said, his voice thick with condescension, “you certainly know how to make an entrance. But allow me to give you some advice—titles mean nothing without experience. You’ll need much more than a name to hold your ground.”
Sadie’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. She met Coyle’s gaze, her expression unshaken as she replied smoothly, “Uncle Coyle, I’ll be counting on your wisdom and guidance in the future.”
Ignoring her, Sutton turned to the room. “Let’s get back to the matter at hand. Please review this document first.” He handed some files to his assistant, who swiftly moved to distribute them to the shareholders and executives.
Sutton leaned back in his chair, exuding arrogance as he spoke. “As you are all aware, my cousin Noah’s current situation remains uncertain. The Wall Group cannot function without leadership, and as per company regulations, the shareholder with the largest…
“Stake holds the final decision-making power.” His words were measured, but a hint of pride and challenge laced his tone.
“Based on the latest figures from last night, my father, Mr. Coyle Wall, now controls 26.31% of Wall Group’s shares. By company rule, this grants him the right to assume the chairman’s position. Does anyone have any ions?”
His gaze swept the room, lingering on each shareholder, daring anyone to .
The regulation was clear.
But everyone here knew the history. Coyle had been exiled overseas by his father years ago, stripped of influence and cut off from company affairs.
And now, he had resurfaced—just in time to stake his claim.
Tension thickened, the weight of unspoken thoughts pressing down on the room.
Then—light and deliberate—a soft chuckle broke the silence.
mr ρdaes ? anovels.cm
“Well, now.”
Sadie’s chuckle was soft, yet carried an unmistakable edge.
An older shareholder’s brow furrowed as he turned to her, his voice heavy with scrutiny.
“Mrs. Wall, care to explain what’s so amusing?”noveldrama
All eyes locked onto Sadie.
With effortless composure, she accepted a document from Samuel, then placed it flat on the table.
The crisp pages unfolded, drawing the attention of every shareholder and executive.
One by one, they leaned in, their eyes scanning the contents, their expressions shifting from confusion to pure disbelief.
It was the latest ranking of Wall Group’s shares, updated at 8 A.M. sharp.
Sadie’s name was at the very top of the list. Her stake in the company? 51.25%.
Nearly twice the amount Coyle held.
Sutton and Briley exchanged incredulous glances, their shock mirrored across the room.
Coyle snatched the document, his eyes darting across the figures, taking in the brutal reality.
His face remained schooled in practiced calm, but his clenched jaw and the sharp glint in his eyes betrayed the storm brewing beneath.
Sadie looked at Coyle, a victorious smile playing on her lips. “The rules dictate that the person with the most shares becomes the chairperson, isn’t that right? If there are no ions, let us end the meeting here.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 640:
“Hold it right there!” Sutton cried out, clearly agitated. “Sadie, do you really think you are qualified to run the company? This file is fake, isn’t it?”
“That must be it!” Briley chimed in excitedly. “You’re from a humble background, Sadie. You practically had nothing to your name! How can you possibly manage such a large conglomerate? Do you think the Wall Group is just some mom-and-pop store in the corner?” She deliberately raised her voice and gave Sadie a look of utter disdain in a blatant attempt to provoke her.
Sure enough, the other shareholders began to whisper among themselves.
Indeed, it was hard to believe that a young woman like Sadie would suddenly possess so many shares and take over a powerful entity like the Wall Group.
In their eyes, Sadie’s existence was insignificant, apart perhaps from the fact that she was married to Noah.
Coyle slowly rose to his feet and spoke like a caring elder, though his concern was fake. “You should think this through carefully before you make any decisions, Sadie. Shouldn’t your household take priority over business matters?”
His words were unmistakably condescending, and perhaps a little threatening.
Standing beside Sadie, Samuel felt his hackles rise. He was worried that Sadie might not be able to handle the pressure when these people attacked her from all sides. After all, these cunning shareholders were seasoned manipulators.noveldrama
To everyone’s surprise, Sadie let out a light and carefree laugh. “Coyle, have you forgotten how you lost your leg years ago?”
Her question struck the room like a bolt of lightning, and the room fell silent all at once. Everyone seemed to be holding their breath.
They were all aware of the incident—several years ago, Coyle had tried to seize power in secret and ended up causing huge losses to the company. As a result, Nigel had sent him overseas—after breaking his…
The event was a taboo within the Wall family, a painful memory that Coyle never wanted to revisit. Now that Sadie had mentioned it, and in front of all these people, it made Coyle scowl. This young woman sure was bold!
Lɑt?st chαpt?rs in glov?ls.?m
Just then, one of the shareholders, who had been silently observing throughout the entire meeting, stood up.
“Mrs. Wall,” he said, peering at Sadie with an odd mix of caution and anticipation. “Why do you look so familiar to me?”
Sadie turned her attention to the elderly man and gave him a polite smile. “Sir, Absolon Stewart was my grandfather, and he used to work for Wall Group.”
Another pregnant silence followed her reply. The shareholders were now wide-eyed with disbelief. Some of the older ones were practically trembling in their seats with excitement.
They had all fought alongside Nigel in the early days of Wall Group, when they had to claw their way up from the ground. How could they not know who Absolon was?
The man was a formidable figure in the business world, known for his excellent skills and foolproof strategies. To say that he had made great contributions to Wall Group during its early stages would be a gross understatement. Many of them had benefited from Absolon’s wit and generosity, one way or another.
Sadly, Absolon chose to leave the company at some point, and no one had any news of him since.
Never had they imagined that Absolon’s own granddaughter would be standing before them today.
The elderly shareholder seemed to be overcome with emotion. He reached out and clasped Sadie’s hand. “It’s no wonder you look so familiar! Rest assured, young lady, no one on the board will bully you as long as we are here!”

###Chapter 641:
Although his eyes were misty and his voice shook, his tone rang out with conviction.
Then, as if to prove himself, he turned and looked at his old comrades. “I, for one, believe that no one is more suitable for the position of chairperson than Sadie!”
“I agree,” another shareholder chimed in.
“If she is Absolon’s granddaughter, then she is certainly more than qualified to be the chairwoman.”
Those who had known Absolon voiced their agreement, their voices growing louder and firmer. Soon, the other shareholders followed suit, until they were all on Sadie’s side. If nothing else, Sadie’s performance just now definitely showed them that she was capable of taking the helm.
Coyle’s hands balled into fists. How was he supposed to know that Sadie was Absolon’s granddaughter? The possibility never even crossed his mind! Nigel really knew how to pick a wife for Noah! Coyle finally understood why Nigel had suddenly arranged for some random, nameless girl to marry the grandson he doted on.
Sadie stared at Coyle, fully aware of her victory. But she also knew not to push too hard. Otherwise, she might provoke her opponent into immediate retaliation. So, Sadie softened her expression.
“I’m still young, and there will surely be certain areas where I will fall short in my duties. I will need your guidance in the future, Uncle Coyle. Briley and Sutton are quite capable as well, not to mention the fact that they are part of the Wall family. I think keeping them in the company would serve the business well.”
Her words were carefully chosen, allowing Coyle some grace while also asserting her stance. She had given him a tough lesson, yet also extended an olive branch. Only a fool would still kick up a fuss after this.noveldrama
Coyle knew it, too. “Fine!” he bit out through gritted teeth. Did he really have any other choice but to agree?
With that, Sadie concluded the meeting and walked out of the room, Samuel close at her heels.
g?lnσν?s?com is where dreams unfold
It wasn’t until they were walking down the hallway that Samuel snapped out of his daze. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and marveled at Sadie’s commanding presence. She had managed to subdue those old foxes with just a few words!
Without a word, Sadie paused and leaned against the wall, taking a few deep breaths.
In truth, all her bravado earlier had been just an act. She knew she needed to appear strong to intimidate her foes. If she showed even the slightest hint of weakness, she wouldn’t have a chance of continuing the discussion.
Meanwhile, the tension from the meeting lingered as the shareholders returned to their respective offices. It didn’t take long before rumors began to spread throughout the company.
“Have you heard? Mr. Wall’s secretary from three years ago, Sadie—do you remember her? Well, she’s actually Mr. Wall’s wife!”
“Really? I thought she was just a secretary. How did she suddenly become the chairwoman?”
“Who knows? Maybe she slept her way to the position, if you know what I mean.”
“Tsk tsk, how shameless! I always thought she acted all high and mighty, but I never imagined her to be this vulgar!”
This came from a group of female employees who had gathered together. Although their voices were hushed, they were still loud enough for nearby employees to overhear them.
Unbeknownst to them, the very person they were discussing was already walking in their direction.
.
.
.
###Chapter 642:
Sadie’s expression was calm and unbothered, as though she couldn’t hear herself being slandered by her subordinates. She wore a bespoke business suit, her hair elegantly pinned up on her head. She looked chic and professional at the same time.
The women who had been gossiping immediately changed their expressions when they noticed her approach, plastering smiles on their faces as they flocked to Sadie.
“Hello, Mrs. Wall!”
“Mrs. Wall, you look beautiful today!”
They were practically falling over themselves to sing her praises.
Sadie swept an indifferent glance over them. “If you want to be of support to me and this company, the best thing you can do is to do your job well.”
Her tone was bland and matter-of-fact.
The women nodded eagerly, reassuring Sadie that they would work hard and not disappoint her.
Sadie’s gaze then shifted to Tina in the corner. “Tina, come with me.”
Tina stood still for a moment, stunned, before quickly jumping to her feet. She happily trailed after Sadie, while her colleagues could only watch in envy.
Sadie walked into the CEO’s office, her eyes immediately scanning the familiar surroundings. Nothing seemed to have changed, except for the fact that Noah was no longer there.
Sadie settled into the chair behind the desk. “Samuel.”
“Here, Mrs. Wall,” Samuel promptly replied.
Sadie lightly tapped her index finger against the desk, her voice soft when she said, “Your duties remain unchanged.”noveldrama
She then looked over at Tina. “Starting today, Tina, you will be in charge of the secretarial department.”
For now, these two were the only people Sadie could trust.
Samuel and Tina exchanged a glance before responding in unison, “Understood.”
After Tina left, Samuel leaned over the desk and lowered his voice. “Mrs. Wall, how should we handle the matters concerning Vivi and Anson?”
Sadie’s eyes turned cold at the mention of these two names. “Send them to the police station for legal proceedings. Make sure to hire the best lawyers to prosecute them.”
“Understood, Mrs. Wall. I’ll take care of it right away.”
Samuel left the office and closed the door behind him, leaving Sadie in silence. She closed her eyes and massaged her temples. When would Noah wake up?
Meanwhile, back in the conference room, Sutton slammed his fist against the long table, his face livid. “Dad, are we just going to let that woman take control of us?” He gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with rage.
Coyle’s expression was equally sullen and resentful. “What else can we do? Do you think I wanted things to turn out this way?”
How could he have known that Sadie was Absolon’s granddaughter? That old geezer had also given Coyle a hard time back in the day! Coyle had really thought the Stewart family had been wiped out, but it seemed that one last weed remained.
“Are we just going to let this go?” Sutton whined, still unwilling to accept the situation. “The Wall Group should be ours—no one else’s!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 643:
Coyle took a deep, steadying breath. “We have all the time in the world to create more opportunities in the future.”
After all, Sadie had said it herself—she was still young. What could she really do?
“Did you make the necessary arrangements at Rosewood Hospital?” Sutton’s eyes flashed with malice.
“Don’t worry. I’ve made all the necessary arrangements to ensure that Noah will never return.” They had waited a long time for this day to come. They refused to fail.
Coyle breathed a sigh of relief but still cautioned his son. “Keep a close watch on Noah. We can’t have anything go wrong.”
“Understood,” Sutton replied before taking out his phone to make a call.
“Everything’s going smoothly. That woman has taken over Wall Group. We need you to deal with Noah.”
“You can count on me,” Hailey Burgess’s voice sounded full of confidence from the other end. “I’ll keep my promise to you. But you’d better not forget your promise to me, Sutton.”
Sutton’s brows furrowed in impatience, but he held his temper and said, “As long as you get it done, you have my guarantee that the Burgess family will rise again. It shouldn’t be that hard; Noah is already in a coma. He’s bound to die sooner or later. However…” Sutton paused and let out a derisive snort. His tone became laced with threat. “If you dare play your little tricks, I’ll see to it myself that you and the rest of the Burgess family meet your end.”
Hailey gritted her teeth and hung up the phone without saying another word. Of all the forms of humiliation she had to face, she hated being threatened the most.
But with the Burgess family’s current situation, she didn’t really have any other choice. She would just have to endure Sutton’s arrogance for now.
Hailey stood from her seat, donned her doctor’s coat, and walked into a VIP hospital suite.
Fresh updates now on gln?es.cm
She was immediately greeted by the sight and sounds of advanced medical equipment that filled most of the space.
Hailey gazed at the man lying on the bed. He had striking features and looked so handsome even when he was unconscious.
She couldn’t help but chuckle under her breath. No matter which way she looked, this man was far more attractive than Sutton. Regrettably, her sole mission was to save the Burgess family.
Hailey walked over to the bedside and produced a syringe from her pocket. It contained a clear liquid, one that could make a comatose person sleep forever.
“I’m sorry, but your life is the price for my family’s future. You’re almost dead anyway. Consider this a gift.”
But as she drew closer, she saw the man’s finger twitch.
Hailey froze, her hand hanging in mid-air.
Wasn’t he supposed to be in a deep coma? What was going on? Who was this man, and why did Sutton want him dead so badly, to the point that he enlisted her, his ex-girlfriend, to do the dirty deed?
Hailey capped the syringe, pocketed it, and left the room to find the nurse stationed outside.
“I need the medical records for the patient in Room 302.”noveldrama
“Certainly, Dr. Burgess,” the nurse replied.
Before long, the nurse returned with a stack of files.
Hailey flipped through the first few pages, her eyes immediately zeroing in on the name written in bold, capital letters.

###Chapter 644:
Noah Wall?
That comatose patient was Noah, the CEO of Wall Group and a titan in the business world?
Compared to Noah, Sutton was nothing more than a rich boy with little power, selling her pipe dreams of saving her family when he had barely done anything to prove his worth. But this man—Noah… Now, he was different!
With his help, not only could she restore her family, but they could rise to new, unimaginable heights.
The fact that he was handsome was just an added bonus!
Lately, her father had been pressuring her to marry the heir of the Clark family, but that man was nothing but trouble.
Hailey stared at the photo in the medical file. Noah’s expression was stern, his gaze piercing. A weaker person wouldn’t dare to look him in the eye.
Heck, Hailey felt her heart skip a beat, even though she was only looking at a picture.
She closed the file and returned to the room.
She got there just in time to see the man’s eyelids flutter, as if he was about to wake up.
Hailey knew that a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was coming her way.
Wasting no time, Hailey bent over and pressed her fingers against Noah’s temples. She proceeded to hypnotize him.
“You will slowly wake up, forget the past, and fall in love with me,” she said, her voice soft and alluring.
The hypnosis worked, and Noah slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was glassy and unfocused.noveldrama
“Who are you?” he asked, bewilderment written on his face.
э$τ ?нαρτ?я$ íπ galnoνe?s.com
Hailey hesitated for a second, then smiled.
“I am your beloved.”
“And who am I?” Noah asked, his brows knitted in confusion.
“You’re my boyfriend, of course,” Hailey answered without batting an eye.
“I’ve been taking care of you for a long time. Thank goodness you’re finally awake!”
Noah took a good look at Hailey, still frowning.
He tried to rifle through his memories, but it was as if his mind was plagued with tendrils of shadows.
He did remember that there was someone he loved deeply, but her face…
Noah narrowed his eyes and tried to match Hailey’s face with the blurred one from his distorted memory.
Was it her?
“You are my girlfriend?” he asked slowly—doubtfully.
But Hailey just beamed and gripped his hand.
“Yes,” she nodded. “It’s me.”
Three years passed.
Sadie had just stepped out of her apartment when Breck walked up to her.
“Mrs. Isabel Wall has returned from her vacation abroad with Averi,” he reported respectfully. “She asked that you dine at Wall Manor tonight.”
Sadie nodded and said, “Got it.”

###Chapter 645:
Her tone was calm, her face blank.
By all appearances, she seemed detached from the affairs of the Wall family.
As she exited the building, Samuel opened the door to the backseat of the car waiting in the driveway.
He couldn’t help but admire Sadie as he looked at her.
After Noah fell into a coma, she had transformed into someone completely different.
She managed to stabilize the turmoil threatening Wall Group with straightforward and decisive tactics. Then, she systematically dealt with the predators circling the company, searching for a weak link to infiltrate. She had also subdued Sutton and Briley effortlessly, and now, they no longer dared to cause any trouble.noveldrama
The once sheltered young woman had become a formidable force in the business world.
Yet behind her strong exterior, there were untold sorrows and heartaches—challenges that only Samuel had witnessed firsthand.
Sadie, of course, was oblivious to Samuel’s thoughts.
She settled into the car and immediately opened her schedule. “Has the marketing department completed the preliminary selection for the overseas partner companies?”
Samuel nodded in response.
“The marketing department has selected the Burgess family. They have rapidly developed over the past couple of years and are now one of the top families in Zupren. They’ve emerged as an unexpected contender on the international scene, and sources say they are now on par with the Wall Group.”
Sadie wasn’t surprised to hear this.
She had already heard of the Burgess family three years ago. Back then, they were on the brink of collapse, struggling with overwhelming debts and an unrelenting swarm of creditors. Yet, in just three short years, the Burgess family managed to make a comeback and even rise to join the elite.

They must have employed unconventional strategies to achieve such an accomplishment.
“Coyle and Sutton seem to be in frequent contact with the current chairman of the Burgess Group, Patrick Noel,” Samuel continued. “I’ve heard that he is the husband of the Burgess family’s heiress. But this Mr. Noel is very mysterious. There’s no public information about him, not even a single photograph.”
Sadie furrowed her brows slightly at that and tapped her finger on her knee.
After a moment’s consideration, she instructed, “Arrange a meeting with Mr. Noel for me. In our line of work, it’s always better to have more friends than enemies.”
“Of course, Ms. Hudson. I’ll make the appointment right away.”
Just minutes later, the car pulled over in front of the company.
Instead of getting out, Samuel hesitated for a moment and then said, “Ms. Hudson, the people we sent to Rosewood Hospital have reported back. Still no news.”
Sadie seemed to fall into a daze for a brief moment but quickly regained her composure with a sharp intake of breath.
She said nothing in response to Samuel’s words, simply opened the door and entered the company building.
Tina approached Sadie as soon as the latter came into view. “Ms. Hudson, the detective just delivered two sets of documents. They’re already in your office.”
Sadie nodded without breaking her stride. “Briley still hasn’t come to the company?”
.

.
###Chapter 646:
Tina nodded as she jogged to keep up with her. “That’s right. Briley hasn’t come in today.”
Sadie finally slowed her pace. “Notify the HR department that Briley is fired. Tell them to make a company-wide announcement to inform everyone.”
Tina was visibly taken aback, but she wasn’t one to question her boss. “Yes, I’ll get right to it.”
Once inside her office, Sadie sat behind her desk and picked up the documents sent by the detective. She spent the next half hour reviewing them.
They contained information on the Burgess Group and its chairman, Patrick Noel.
Much to Sadie’s dismay, the information she received was limited, with only a few notes about this Patrick guy.
Mysterious, low-key, and highly skilled.
That was how he was evaluated by the detective she had hired. By the time Sadie finished reading everything, her brows were knitted into a tight frown.
Whoever that man was, he really was mysterious to an excessive extent. Even the country’s top detective couldn’t find any useful information about his background.
It looked like he would be more challenging to deal with than Sadie had initially anticipated.
Still, the more elusive he was, the more determined she was to meet him.
After finishing the day’s work, Sadie clocked off and drove to Wall Manor.
No sooner had she walked through the foyer than a small figure barreled into her.
“Mommy!”
After three years, Averi had grown quite a bit. His baby fat had tapered into more refined features, and he looked more and more like Noah with each passing day.
Sitting on the sofa, Isabel smiled and waved Sadie over. “Come here, Sadie. Averi missed you so much.”
M s  s.
Sadie picked up her son and carried him into the living room, a rare smile gracing her face.
“Did you behave, Averi? Did you follow everything Grandma said?” Averi clung to his mother’s neck and nodded vigorously. “Yes! I always listen to Grandma’s words.”noveldrama
Isabel’s expression grew tender as she watched mother and son.
Her attitude toward Sadie had changed drastically over the past three years. She used to dislike her daughter-in-law, but now, she treated Sadie like her own biological daughter. After what happened to Noah, Isabel had pinned all her hopes on Sadie and Averi.
Dinner was prepared by Isabel herself. The family sat around the dining table, enjoying a cozy and harmonious meal. They were still eating when a servant rushed in.
“Mrs. Wall, Mr. Coyle Wall and Mr. Sutton Wall have arrived.”
He had barely finished speaking when Coyle and Sutton stormed in with a group of bodyguards. Isabel’s smile vanished instantly. She slammed her utensils onto the table and demanded, “What do you think you’re doing in my home? Do you think Wall Manor is a shelter for the homeless now?”
Sadie met Gabriel’s eyes and gave him a silent signal. Gabriel wasted no time and quietly whisked Averi upstairs. Sadie rose from her seat and walked to Isabel’s side.
“Isabel,” she said softly, touching the older woman’s arm. “Don’t get worked up. You’ll make yourself ill with anger.”
.

###Chapter 647:
Isabel sneered, but she reached up to squeeze Sadie’s hand. “Just take a look at these two bastards!”
Coyle’s smile froze, and a flicker of malice crossed his eyes.
“Don’t you think you’re being too harsh, Isabel? We are family, after all. Surely, we can have a civil conversation. There’s no need to make a scene. It won’t do any of us any good.”
Isabel huffed. “Family? A civil conversation? Please, it sounds even more ridiculous coming from your mouth!”
Isabel was direct, giving Coyle no room to save face. “If it weren’t for your injured leg, I would have had you thrown out long ago! Your mother, that shameless homewrecker, got Nigel’s wife killed and tried to poison Nigel into removing Noah’s father from his position as chairman! You deserved to get your leg broken and be banished from the country! How dare you barge into Wall Manor as if you own the place? It looks like you’ve forgotten the painful lessons from your past!”
Sadie was unaware of this. All she knew was that years ago, Coyle had used unscrupulous methods in an attempt to take control of the company, which led to Nigel breaking his leg and sending him abroad. She never realized that there was so much more to that story. Coyle was even more insidious and cunning than she had imagined.
Isabel was still letting out a string of expletives, her anger growing with every word she said.
“Someone! Throw these shameless people out!”
Coyle’s face darkened, and he finally dropped all pretense.
“Isabel, whatever grudges existed between the elders have nothing to do with our generation. Why take them out on us?”
Sutton was more blunt than his father. Shoving aside the approaching servants, he stepped forward and demanded in a harsh tone,
“You old hag, have you no sense of propriety? My father was speaking to you politely; don’t take his courtesy for granted!”
I/t?$+ ?h?pt?r?  g?vê.c?m
With that, the entire situation descended into chaos.
Before things escalated further, Sadie slammed her palm against the table, startling everyone into silence. All heads turned in her direction. Sadie’s gaze was icy as she swept it over Coyle and Sutton.
“Coyle, Sutton, this is Wall Manor. It’s not a place for your dirty, petty antics. Take your people and leave immediately!”
Although her voice wasn’t particularly loud, it carried absolute authority. Right on cue, Samuel came into the living room with a team of bodyguards and surrounded Coyle and his men.
Sadie turned to Isabel, her voice softening.
“I’ll take care of this. You should head up and rest.”
A servant instantly stepped forward and helped Isabel upstairs. When Sadie looked back at Coyle and Sutton, her eyes were cold and indifferent again.
“I’ll say this one last time, Coyle. Take your men and leave Wall Manor.”
Needless to say, Sutton was enraged by her attitude. They had tolerated her for three years, and their patience had worn thin. He pointed a finger at Sadie and yelled,
“You wretch! Who do you think you are? This is Wall Manor, not a place for an outsider like you to act out!”
Sadie’s eyes narrowed, her gaze turning sharp as a blade.

###Chapter 648:
“An outsider?” she scoffed, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “Have you forgotten who holds the power in Wall Group right now? Who is preserving the last bit of dignity for your branch of the family?”
Sutton fell into silence at that, his face turning sour. He wanted to retort, of course, but found that there was nothing he could say.
Sadie couldn’t be bothered to waste any more of her time on them. She glanced at Samuel and said, “Escort them out. Drag them if necessary.”
Samuel gave a brisk nod in response and signaled to the bodyguards to take action.
Seeing this, Sutton grew even more incensed. He opened his mouth, no doubt to let out another rant.
“Sutton,” Sadie interrupted before he could utter a single word. “It would do you some good to watch your mouth. Consider this a warning. If you dare speak to me with such disrespect again, I promise you, there will be consequences.”
But he remained defiant.
“You bitch! Don’t get too cocky! You think becoming the chairman changes anything? I’m telling you right now, the Wall Group will never be yours!”
Sadie just stared at him, her heart calm and steady. These were nothing more than empty threats to her, and she didn’t care in the slightest.
“Is that so?” she asked lightly—dismissively. “Go ahead and try, then.”
By that point, Sutton’s face was red with rage.
“Fine, Sadie! Remember, you asked for it!” He spoke through gritted teeth, but there was a new determination in his gaze, as though he had made a significant decision.
Sensing that his son was about to act rashly, Coyle rushed to intervene.
“That’s enough, Sutton!”noveldrama
Your next story is here g?lnσνels?com
“Did you hear what she just said, Dad? She doesn’t respect our family at all!”
Coyle sullenly glared at his son, silently ordering him to stop talking. As much as he hated it, Sutton obediently shut his mouth and lowered his head.
Coyle tried to look pained as he turned back to Sadie.
“Sadie, I know you are not satisfied with our branch. But if there are any misunderstandings, I’m sure we can talk them out. Why blow things out of proportion and back us into a corner?”
Sadie almost laughed at that last part. This particular family really had a talent for playing the victims. Wasn’t it them who had been scheming and plotting against her at every turn?
Unfortunately for Coyle, Sadie had already seen through his facade. She knew exactly what he was like—hypocritical, insidious, and opportunistic. He would say anything and do anything to achieve his goals.
Arguing with him would only be a waste of time and energy.
“You didn’t come all the way to Wall Manor just to question me about this, did you, Coyle?” Sadie cut straight to the point.
Coyle’s face stiffened, and his eyes flickered for a brief second.
Since Sadie had more or less seen through his act, Coyle saw no reason to continue with the pretense.
“You’re quite straightforward, aren’t you?” he said with a light chuckle.
“Well, now that it’s come to this, I’ll stop beating around the bush. What are you planning to do about Briley?”
As expected, Coyle and Sutton had stormed over because of Briley’s dismissal.
.
.
.
###Chapter 649:
Sadie smirked to herself.
She had anticipated their reaction to Briley’s firing, but she hadn’t expected them to confront her so quickly, within a single day.
Sadie exchanged a knowing glance with Samuel.
Understanding the message, Samuel grabbed a folder from one of the bodyguards and tossed it onto the floor in front of Coyle.
“See for yourself,” Samuel said with obvious disdain.
It was Sutton who bent down, grabbed the folder, and flipped through the documents inside. His expression grew increasingly grim as he read, and soon his eyes widened with shock.
The documents contained all the information a private detective agency had uncovered about Briley. There were numerous photos, written records, and even a hospital report.
The photos showed Briley frequenting nightclubs, living recklessly, and getting intimate with various men. Some of the photos were quite explicit.
The written records detailed her regular activities—who she met and where she went. Every move was meticulously documented.
Then there was the hospital report, which revealed that Briley had recently undergone an abortion.
The more Sutton read, the more horrified he became. He couldn’t believe his sister was leading such a reckless life behind the scenes. She had even had an abortion!
These revelations shattered the image he had of Briley.
“What does this mean? Did you actually have someone investigate my sister?”
Sadie scoffed. “Do you honestly think you’re in a position to question my actions, Sutton? Briley hasn’t shown up at the company for a week. As her boss, I am well within my rights to investigate her whereabouts. Or are you suggesting that you and your family can simply disregard the company rules and come and go as you please?”noveldrama
Gal n o v el s . com is your destination for fiction
Sutton was at a loss for words. It was indeed wrong for Briley not to show up at the company, but he couldn’t bring himself to accept the consequences that followed.
“She might be wrong to skip work, but that doesn’t mean you can just pry into her private affairs! You’re not fooling anyone, Sadie. I know you deliberately did this to drive her out of the company! You’ve publicized this to the entire company. How could Briley face anyone now? You ruined her reputation!”
Coyle had also read the contents of the documents. He wasn’t as agitated as Sutton, but his expression turned unpleasant. The photos of his daughter were particularly humiliating, and seeing her in such a state felt like a physical blow to his chest. Even so, he knew he needed to maintain his composure—for now.
Coyle heaved a deep, regretful sigh. “Sadie, I know you’ve had misunderstandings with Briley, but she is still young and naive. She is bound to make mistakes here and there. Why do you have to be so ruthless and ruin her future?”
Sadie looked him up and down, her disgust clear on her face. Even now, the old fox was pretending to be a concerned and benevolent father. The hypocrisy of this family was truly something to behold.
“Misunderstandings?” she repeated in a mocking tone. She gestured at the documents now in Coyle’s hands. “Do you see those as mere misunderstandings, Coyle? I’ll say it one last time—Briley is fired from Wall Group. From today onwards, she is no longer an employee, and is in no way connected to the company. Feel free to take this up with the board if you like. I don’t mind presenting those documents as grounds for her termination, so everyone can see what kind of person your precious daughter really is!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 650:
Sadie then turned to Samuel. “Show them out. And make sure to tighten the security around Wall Manor starting today. If you see any trespassers, throw them out! Consequences be damned.”
The veins on Sutton’s throat and forehead bulged when he heard that. This woman was truly infuriating!
Coyle and Sutton were already in the car, but they still couldn’t let the matter go.
“Aren’t we going to do something, Dad? Are we just going to let Briley suffer like this?” Sutton grumbled. Sadie was becoming more and more irritating, making their lives increasingly unbearable.noveldrama
Coyle’s pent-up anger suddenly surged inside him, and with one swift motion, he slapped Sutton so hard it knocked his head to the side.
“Don’t mention your sister again!” Coyle thundered. “All of this is her fault!”
Sutton cupped his swelling cheek and stared at his father in disbelief. Coyle’s chest was heaving, and his face was a mask of pure rage. If it weren’t for Briley’s foolishness, things wouldn’t have escalated to this point.
Coyle’s hands balled into fists on his lap. “Go find your sister, and bring her back to me!”
“Understood,” Sutton replied through gritted teeth.
Once his men found Briley at the Night Owl Bar, Sutton rushed over. The bar was lively, with bright lights and loud music blaring across the room.
When the manager saw Sutton step through the door, he immediately paled. He hurried over, bowing incessantly as he said, “Mr. Wall, it’s an honor having you here. What brings you to our humble establishment?”
Sutton swept a gaze over the group of people on the dance floor. “Tell everyone to leave,” he ordered.
The manager froze, thinking he had misheard.

“Tell everyone to leave?” This was peak business hours for the bar. If he asked the customers to leave, their books would suffer significant losses.
When the manager didn’t move, Sutton scowled and snapped, “Did you not hear what I just said?” His voice was cold and commanding.
The manager shuddered in fright before bobbing his head in earnest. “Yes, yes, of course. I’ll handle it right away.” If he defied Sutton, he might as well close his bar down for good.
The manager scampered off and made the necessary arrangements. The patrons were naturally displeased, but when they spotted the black-clad bodyguards flanking Sutton near the entrance, they kept their heads down and left without complaint.
Before long, the bar was nearly empty.
Sutton found his sister locked in a sloppy kiss with a slick-looking man in the far corner of the bar. Briley was so drunk that her vision was blurry, and she was completely unaware of the shift in the bar’s atmosphere.
Sutton stormed over and pulled them apart. The man was almost knocked to the floor. He shot to his feet, about to curse his assailant, but when he recognized Sutton, his nerve evaporated. He awkwardly scooted to the other end of the booth.
As for Briley, she was stunned but still very much under the haze of alcohol. “Who dares to interrupt my…” she mumbled angrily, only trailing off when she saw Sutton standing before her. It was like a bucket of cold water had been thrown over her, sobering her up a bit. “Sutton,” Briley mumbled, averting her gaze.
Sutton’s face was grim as he caught her wrist in a tight grip. “You’re coming home with me!”
.

###Chapter 651:
He forcefully dragged her out, paying no mind to her stumbling behind him. To her credit, Briley knew she was in real trouble this time, so she wisely shut her mouth.
It was midnight when they arrived at Riverside Villa, their family residence. Coyle was waiting for them in the living room, his expression dark and ominous as he sat on the sofa, arms crossed over his chest. He glanced up at the sound of the door opening and glared at his daughter.
Briley felt a chill race down her spine. She lowered her head, like a child caught misbehaving.
Sutton had briefed her on the recent events during their ride home. A ball of dread had formed in the pit of Briley’s stomach, and the more she listened, the clearer it became how badly she had messed up. Now, facing her father, she felt even more flustered and lost.
Coyle seethed as he studied his disappointing daughter. He raised his hand, intending to slap Briley across the face, but he stopped when he noticed her trembling.
In the end, he lowered his hand and sighed in defeat.
“You worthless fool!” he berated, unable to stop himself.
Sutton sighed as well, but his anger had cooled since earlier.noveldrama
“Now isn’t the time, Dad. We need to think about what to do next.”
Coyle threw his hands in the air in frustration. “What can we do? That vicious bitch is determined to destroy us. It’s only a matter of time before she takes complete control over the Wall Group.”
Sutton fell silent. He knew all too well that the circumstances were not in their favor. But he refused to just sit back and watch as Sadie slowly took over their family business.
An idea suddenly occurred to him, and Sutton’s eyes lit up. “Dad, maybe we still have a chance.”
Coyle frowned. “What are you talking about?”

Sutton’s lips curled into a devious smile. “Alex.”
Coyle was confused at first, but as his mind slowly caught on, his eyes glinted with excitement. “You mean, a marriage alliance?”
“Exactly.” Sutton nodded. “If we can secure a marriage between Briley and Alex, we can use his power and influence to strengthen our position in the company. That way, no matter how arrogant Sadie gets, she won’t be able to touch us.”
Coyle’s eyes flickered. It was a tempting prospect, but he wasn’t entirely convinced yet. “Will Alex agree? The Howe family is among the elite, after all. As a branch of the Wall family, Coyle and his children might be considered prominent in some circles, but they were still several levels below the Howe family.”
A confident smile broke across Sutton’s face. “Don’t worry about that, Dad.”
“Leave it to me. I will make sure Alex agrees.” Then Sutton turned to Briley and said, “I’m counting on you to make this work, Briley.”
Her head jerked up, and she stared at him in surprise and bewilderment. She wasn’t expecting the conversation to suddenly shift in her direction. “Me?” she squeaked.
Sutton’s tone was firm. “Yes, you. You need to find a way to make Alex fall for you. If you manage to marry him, our family will have a shot at turning things around.”
“Briley,” Coyle chimed in eagerly, “this is for the good of the family. Once you marry Alex, everything the Wall family has will be yours.”
Briley frowned and bit her lower lip, but she eventually nodded. “I understand. I will do my best.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 652:
Sutton pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to her. “That’s Alex’s itinerary for the next week. Make sure you study it, then find a way to get close to him. Remember, we can’t afford any mistakes this time!”
Briley did just that, memorizing the schedule like it was the Bible. It wasn’t that hard, really, since winning a man’s heart was a skill she had long since mastered.
Meanwhile, Sadie returned to Myrtlewood Estate.
After three years, the once bustling property was now eerily silent. Breck approached as soon as she walked through the door. “Good evening. Would you like us to cook something for you?” He assumed that she was going to work late again.
Sadie paused for a moment, then nodded. “Just something light, please. Thank you.”
She changed into her house slippers and went upstairs to her study.
She had barely sat behind her desk when her phone rang.
It was Alex. “Sadie, I’ve booked a restaurant. Shall we have a meal together tomorrow?”
He sounded so expectant on the line. Sadie’s first instinct was to decline, but he quickly added, “Oh, and I’ve found another specialist known to be an expert in treating comatose patients.”
The mention of this specialist made her pause, and after mulling it over, she finally agreed. “Alright.”
Alex had been helping her these last three years, looking for experts and sending them one after another to Rosewood Hospital.
Although the results were always disappointing, she was still very grateful to him.
“Great! See you tomorrow at lunch?”
?tst chαpt?rs in glnovels.c?
“Sure thing.”
Sadie hung up and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, her eyes distant and dazed. After three whole years, Noah still hadn’t woken up. But she needed to be strong; she had to keep the Wall Group afloat while he was gone.
When noon rolled around the next day, Sadie gathered her purse and went to the restaurant Alex had booked. It was a cozy establishment with an unmistakably romantic vibe. Not that Sadie had any interest in that sort of thing. Her eyes immediately went to the man sitting by the window.
Today, he wore a cream-colored suit, looking elegant and refined. Beside him was a middle-aged man, presumably the specialist he had mentioned the previous night.
Alex noticed Sadie as she drew nearer. He smiled and waved at her. The middle-aged man stood up when she reached the table and extended his hand to Sadie.
“Ms. Hudson, this is Quinton Ross,” Alex introduced with a pleasant smile. “You can call him Dr. Ross. He’s the one I told you about.”
“Please have a seat, Ms. Hudson,” Quinton said politely. He gestured to one of the empty chairs, and Sadie took the one opposite Alex.
“Thank you for giving us your time, Dr. Ross.”noveldrama
“It’s no trouble,” Quinton replied with a wave of his hand, then began speaking at length. He discussed various cases of comatose patients and medical theories. He did sound very knowledgeable in the area.
Sadie listened quietly, nodding every now and then. When Quinton was finally done, she said, “Thank you for your efforts, Dr. Ross.”
It was then that Alex cast a pointed glance at Quinton. In response, he gave Alex a subtle nod.
.
.
.
###Chapter 653:
“Oh dear, I’m getting forgetful in my age!” Quinton suddenly exclaimed. “I have a meeting this afternoon. I need to hurry over there before it starts.”
He stood up to leave.
“I’m terribly sorry about this, Ms. Hudson, Mr. Howe. But I’m afraid I must go.”
“Take care, Dr. Ross,” Alex said nonchalantly, standing up as well to see him off.
A moment later, Sadie and Alex were left alone. The air between them was suddenly charged, and a love song started playing in the background. They suddenly looked like they were dating.
Sadie felt a wave of unease and tried to look for a graceful exit. But Alex suddenly reached across the table and took her hand.
“Sadie.”
Sadie stiffened at the contact.
“Sorry,” Alex continued, his expression sheepish and apologetic. “I didn’t realize the restaurant’s vibe before booking it.” He feigned ignorance.noveldrama
Sadie quietly withdrew her hand. “I’m very grateful to you for all your help these past three years, Mr. Howe. As for everything else… I’m sorry.”
Alex’s smile froze for a few seconds, but he quickly regained his composure. “It’s all right, no worries at all,” he said with a light-hearted tone. “We can still share a meal, can’t we? As friends?”
Sadie finally allowed herself to relax.
Before long, their table was laden with classic dishes. Alex, ever the gentleman, offered to cut Sadie’s steak for her. “Is there still no news from Rosewood Hospital?” he asked, his tone concerned.
Sadie shook her head. Three years, and there was still no news whatsoever. Noah seemed to have vanished into thin air.
Alex carefully put the plate of steak in front of her. “Don’t lose hope. We’ll see him eventually.”

Sadie mustered a weak smile and thanked him.
Unbeknownst to the two, a pair of eyes was watching them from the shadows.
Briley was hiding behind a nearby pillar, nibbling on her thumb as she watched Alex and Sadie. That faint, demure smile on Sadie’s face drove Briley mad with jealousy.
Who gave her the right to dine with Alex and smile at him like that? Briley gnashed her teeth together as a wave of resentment surged in her heart.
Sadie was openly flirting with Alex! Just how shameless could she get? The fact that they looked like a perfect match only angered Briley even more.
She had come here to try her luck and see if she would happen to run into Alex. Well, she did. The problem was, Alex was with Sadie!
The more Briley thought about it, the more she hated Sadie.
Meanwhile, Sadie had very little appetite, and after a few bites, she spent the rest of the meal pushing her food around on her plate. Alex, on the other hand, was very talkative. He never failed to find a new topic to discuss. But even his enthusiasm had no effect on Sadie. She just smiled politely and gave him short responses every now and then.
“I’m going to the restroom.”
“All right. I’ll wait for you here.”
Alex stood up to watch Sadie leave, his brows slightly furrowed. In the distance, Briley saw Sadie walk away and knew her chance had come. She adjusted her expression and pretended to act casual as she walked toward Alex.
.

###Chapter 654:
“Oops!” Briley suddenly cried out, stumbling over a nonexistent .
“Careful!” Alex reacted quickly, reaching out to steady her before she fell to the floor.
Briley took advantage of the opportunity and practically threw herself into his arms. “Thank you, sir,” she said in a soft voice.
Alex frowned slightly as he helped her stand up straight and took a few steps back, putting some distance between them. “Are you okay?”
Briley looked up at him, her eyes widening as if she had only just recognized him. “Oh! Mr. Howe.” Although she acted surprised, she couldn’t seem to help the way her eyes glinted with delight. “What brings you here?”
Alex narrowed his gaze, and his tone was more aloof when he asked, “Who might you be, Miss?”
The question made Briley bristle. “I can’t believe you’ve forgotten about me, Mr. Howe. We met at a charity gala. I offered a toast to you, and you even complimented me on my looks.”
At this point, Alex was scowling, and he made no attempt to hide his impatience.
“I apologize. I have other things to attend to, so I’ll be leaving now.” With that, he turned to leave, but Briley called out to him yet again.
“Mr. Howe, thank you so much for earlier.”
She bit her lip and decided to take a chance. “To express my gratitude, I’d like to ask you out for dinner tonight.”
Alex stopped in his tracks and glanced back at Briley. “There’s no need. It was a small thing.” His rejection was short but firm, and his tone was chilly. It left her no room for negotiation.noveldrama
Briley’s expression soured. She wasn’t expecting him to reject her advances so succinctly. But she wasn’t about to give up just yet.
Before Briley could say anything else, however, the door to the restroom opened. Sadie walked out, only to stop short at the scene before her.
New content available g?lnσνes?com
Briley had been missing for a week. What was she doing here?
Briley also noticed Sadie’s presence. She acted quickly, rushing to Alex’s side with a helpless look on her face.
“Oh, Sadie. You’re here, too?” Briley asked with feigned surprise. “I was just thanking Mr. Howe. He saved me from a fall just now.” Her tone was sickly sweet, and undeniably flirtatious. “I’ve heard you and Mr. Howe are acquainted, but I didn’t realize you were this close.” Her implication was that there was more to Sadie and Alex’s relationship than met the eye.
Sadie cocked her head to the side and shot Briley a look of disdain. “Yes, we are close. Unlike you, I’ve known Mr. Howe for a long time,” she replied. “Mr. Howe and I are just friends. You, on the other hand…”
Sadie’s gaze was sharp as she sized Briley up.
“You’ve been missing for days. I thought you found a new boyfriend and forgot your way home. So what happened? Did you get tired of him? Is that why you suddenly showed up again?”
She was ruthless, exposing Briley’s true nature without giving the latter any room to make excuses.
Briley was visibly taken aback. Her cheeks and ears flushed red. She wanted to retort, but she wasn’t sure how to counter Sadie’s accusation.
Alex stood and watched the exchange, feeling a warm joy at seeing Sadie protect him. Then he quietly moved to Sadie’s side until they were shoulder to shoulder.
“Let’s go,” he said in a gentle tone.

###Chapter 655:
Sadie nodded, and they left the restaurant without sparing Briley another glance.
Briley could only stamp her foot in frustration. “Damn that bitch! Always calling me out and exposing me to other people!” she cursed through gritted teeth.
Briley had heard rumors about Alex’s supposed affection for Sadie. It seemed that those rumors were indeed true. Otherwise, why would he be so considerate toward Sadie, yet dismissive of her?
Briley’s chest heaved with indignation.
“It would be best if you keep your distance from Briley,” Sadie warned Alex as they stepped out of the restaurant. She had a feeling that Briley’s sudden appearance wasn’t as simple as it seemed.
“Are you jealous?” Alex asked, the ghost of a smile dancing on his lips. He presumed that Sadie was upset because he had helped Briley.
“Of course not,” Sadie replied, casting him a cool glance.
“I helped her out of reflex,” Alex quickly explained. “I had no idea who she was. Don’t worry, it won’t happen again. I promise to steer clear of her from now on.” He raised his right hand as though he was swearing an oath.
Sadie just nodded and said nothing more, completely ignoring Alex’s obvious joy.
“Shall I drive you back to the office?” he offered.
“That won’t be necessary. I have other things to take care of. Let’s part ways here.” Sadie didn’t even wait for Alex to respond and got into the car parked by the road.
Alex watched as the sports car sped away, a trace of disappointment flickering in his eyes.
Moments later, Sadie was back at the company.
Samuel was upon her as soon as she entered her office. “Ms. Hudson, Burgess Group has responded. Mr. Noel is willing to meet with you. The appointment is set for next Wednesday.”

Sadie nodded absentmindedly. “In that case, please arrange the trip to Zupren.”
“Ah,” Samuel exclaimed. His tone was cautious when he continued, “Well, as it happens, Mr. Noel is returning to the country next Tuesday.”
“He’s coming back?” Sadie was slightly surprised by this news, but she didn’t dwell on it. “Then make sure we give him a proper reception.”noveldrama
“Understood,” Samuel replied before going about making the necessary preparations.
That afternoon, Sadie went down to the second floor. In order to better manage her work, she had integrated her studio into the Wall Group and turned the entire second floor into a massive design department. She had also promoted Nanette to supervisor.
Nanette greeted her at the elevator banks. “Ms. Hudson, the initial draft has been sent over,” she reported with a sigh of relief. “Miss Travis is very satisfied. We can start with the final product.”
Sadie nodded her approval.
Nigel’s death and Noah’s coma had occurred back to back, which caused Zoe’s wedding to be delayed. Now, three years later, the wedding was finally back on the table. Sadie walked over to her workstation.
She blocked all external distractions and focused on the draft in front of her. As her fingers brushed the cold drawing board, her mind gradually calmed.
She had devoted the last three years to her work. It was the only way she could forget the painful memories and find a sense of purpose in life.

###Chapter 656:
Before she knew it, dusk had fallen. She stretched her arms, ready to call it a day. She rubbed her weary eyes and gathered her belongings, completely unaware of a hidden camera secretly aimed at her. The person in the shadows snapped a few quick photos and sneaked out of the design department.
Retreating into the fire exit, he compiled the pictures he had taken and sent them to Hailey.
At a villa in the suburbs, Hailey glanced at the photo on her screen before turning her gaze to the distinguished man a few feet away. As always, Noah exuded an intimidating aura.
Hailey walked over and sat down next to him, casually placing her hand in his. Noah’s reaction was subtle yet immediate, moving his hand to dodge her touch.noveldrama
Hailey noticed, of course, but she didn’t get upset. Instead, she handed him her phone.
“Look, Noah. This is Sadie Hudson, the granddaughter of Absolon Stewart and the current president of Wall Group.”
Noah stared at the photo and was momentarily lost in his thoughts. The woman on the screen looked focused on her work but weary at the same time. Despite this, he couldn’t deny the unique charisma she carried herself with. More to the point, he felt a sense of familiarity toward her, even though he couldn’t recall where he had seen her before.
Hailey silently observed the shift in his expression.
“If it hadn’t been for this woman, you wouldn’t have gotten into a car accident three years ago and fallen into a coma. She wouldn’t have succeeded in taking all your shares.” She leaned close and added, “But don’t worry. I’ll be by your side, no matter what happens.”
Noah locked the phone screen and tossed it aside with a humorless laugh.
“You’ve been saying that for three years now.”
L?t?st chαpt?rs in glnovels.
He knew very well what Hailey was trying to convey. He knew what he needed to do.
Hailey stiffened at his words. “I’m just concerned for you,” she said, sounding aggrieved.
Noah pressed his fingers against his temples. “It’s getting late,” he said in an indifferent tone. “I’d like to rest early.”
Before Hailey could respond, he stood up and went upstairs.
She sighed as she watched him go. Thanks to Noah, the Burgess Group had risen from the brink of bankruptcy. She was also able to utilize many of Wall Group’s overseas resources, making her act of saving him quite worthwhile.
In the past three years, Hailey had come to realize that Noah was a far better catch than Sutton. If he returned to the country and regained control of Wall Group, the Burgess Group would surely soar to even greater heights.
Hailey had done her homework, investigating everything there was to know about Noah. She ultimately concluded that Sadie posed a constant threat to her plans.
To counter that, Hailey had meticulously painted Sadie as an adversary in Noah’s eyes, using his distorted memory to her advantage. Gradually, Noah had grown to completely despise Sadie.
But to keep him for good, the best solution would be to have a child with him. Unfortunately for Hailey, Noah had never touched her in the last three years.
What else could she do?
She lay back on the sofa, feeling restless, when her phone rang. It was Sutton.
Hailey’s lips curled into a sly smile. “Sutton,” she greeted playfully. “To what do I owe this pleasure? Are you missing your old flame?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 657:
Sutton didn’t mince his words. “Let’s meet up. I know you and Patrick returned to the country ahead of schedule.”noveldrama
Hailey was stunned to hear that, but she refused to give him the satisfaction of knowing he had caught her off-guard. “I must say, your intel is quite efficient.”
“What? Are you scared I would attack you or something?” Sutton chuckled. “Relax. I just want to catch up with an old friend.”
Hailey took a moment to consider it before eventually agreeing. “Where?”
“Coastal Luxe.”
Hailey hung up and threw a glance at the staircase. Noah had been busy in the past few days, relentlessly digging into Sadie’s background.
He looked just as tired as she had on the photo as he sat at his desk. Countless documents containing information on Sadie were scattered in front of him.
Noah had lost count of the number of times he had gone over them. Even so, his instincts told him that there was more he needed to know. A part of his mind seemed to be shrouded in a thick fog, and whenever he tried to probe into it, his head would immediately get a dull ache. He was supposed to meet Sadie on Wednesday. He had to understand his opponent fully before then.
Half an hour later, at Coastal Luxe.
A pair of arms snaked around Hailey’s waist as soon as she entered the room Sutton had booked for them. Her body stiffened at the contact.
“Still so sensitive,” Sutton whispered intimately into her ear. Hailey whipped around and pushed him away, causing Sutton to land on the soft bed.
“What exactly do you want?” Hailey asked coldly, her brows furrowing into a frown.
“Oh, come on. Don’t be so distant,” Sutton said as he sat up and tried to reach for her face. “We’ve had good times, haven’t we? We’ve even tried every position in bed.”
Hailey’s expression turned even more aloof. “If you have nothing else to say, I’m leaving.”

She turned away, but Sutton grabbed her arm. “Don’t be in such a rush. I wanted to discuss a business deal with you.”
Intrigued, Hailey looked back, her eyebrows raised. “What business deal?”
Sutton moved over to the sofa and gestured for her to join him.
“A collaboration. The Burgess Group can join forces with my family, and once we bring Sadie down, we will split the Wall Group’s assets equally.”
Hailey burst out laughing. She walked over to Sutton but didn’t sit. Instead, she stood before him with a defiant glint in her eyes.
“Sutton, the Burgess Group is no longer what it used to be.”
Undeterred, Sutton embraced her waist again and pulled her closer. “I know the real reason the Burgess Group shifted its business back to the country. But you’ve just returned. You need someone to teach you the ropes around the domestic market. This fifty-fifty split is quite suitable, don’t you think?”
Sutton’s voice carried a seductive persuasion, and Hailey felt swayed. He was right. She and Noah had returned early for the express purpose of observing the local scene and assessing Wall Group’s position. If she managed to get some information out of Sutton first, it would greatly benefit the Burgess Group. As for the division of assets that he was proposing, well, it might now be Sutton’s decision to make in the future.
Hailey smiled, her tone softening. “You’ve got yourself a deal.”
Sutton flashed her a triumphant grin before pushing Hailey down onto the sofa so she was beneath him.
.
.
.
###Chapter 658:
“What do you think you’re doing?” she cried out in alarm. “Let go of me!”
When Sutton spoke again, his voice was laced with menace and danger.
“Did you complete the task I gave you three years ago? Did you make sure that Noah never wakes up?”
Hailey paused and hesitated.
At the end of the day, she needed what Sutton offered, so she lied to him.
“Of course.”
An idea suddenly occurred to her then.
Since Noah refused to touch her, why didn’t she make use of Sutton instead?
Coming to a decision right then and there, Hailey wound her arms around Sutton’s neck to initiate a kiss.
Sutton chuckled smugly.
“It looks like Patrick hasn’t been satisfying you.”
Then he swooped in to kiss her.noveldrama
The air inside the room soon turned thick and heavy.
In the middle of the night, Hailey quietly slipped out of the bed.
With only the light of the moon streaming through the windows, she tiptoed to where she had dropped her purse and took out her phone.
She quickly composed a message and sent it.
Sutton was a deeply calculating person, and he was constantly suspicious of the people around him.
He would eventually discover that Noah was still alive, and when that happened, Hailey knew he would not let her off easily.
For now, she would just have to take a risk.
l?v.cm brings fresh updates
Tuesday.
Sadie had just wrapped up her morning meeting.
Samuel was supposed to fetch Patrick from the airport, but he returned to the company with an apologetic look on his face.
“I thought you went to pick up Mr. Noel,” Sadie said when she saw him.
“I was able to pick up some people from that particular flight, but it turned out to be a team from the Burgess Group. They are likely settling in at their hotel as we speak. As for Mr. Noel and Ms. Burgess, they apparently returned to the country last Saturday.”
Sadie frowned at that.
She had dealt with difficult business partners before, but this was the first time she had encountered someone so unpredictable.
“I suppose it’s fine,” she said, not all that concerned. “We’ll see him tomorrow anyway. We can discuss things then.”
Samuel nodded in agreement.
Sadie continued walking ahead, all while rattling off instructions for Samuel regarding the next day’s schedule.
Once she was in her office, Sadie settled behind her desk and reached for the landline. She was about to call for a meeting with the marketing department when her personal phone suddenly rang.
The number flashing on her screen was unfamiliar, but it showed that the call was coming from Zupren.
Sadie’s brows furrowed as she pressed to answer.
.
.
.
###Chapter 659:
“Hello, is this Ms. Sadie Hudson?”
A male voice came through the line, his tone calm yet tinged with regret.
Sadie instantly felt an overwhelming sense of dread.
“Yes, this is she. May I know who’s calling?”
“I’m calling on behalf of Rosewood Hospital. I’m afraid we need to inform you of Mr. Wall’s situation.”
Sadie’s breath caught in her throat. It felt as though a gigantic hand had clamped around her heart and was slowly squeezing it.
“Did something happen to Noah?”
Sadie’s voice trembled with fear.
“I’m very sorry, Ms. Hudson. Mr. Wall passed away last night due to sudden heart failure. We did all we could to save him, but our efforts were in vain. Please accept our deepest condolences.”
Noah had passed away?
Sadie’s mind went blank, and there was a ringing in her ears.
How could Noah die, just like that?
It had only been a few days since she had met with Isabel, who had mentioned that Noah was doing well.
How could he pass away so suddenly?
Sadie felt the color drain from her face, and her grip tightened around her phone until her fingers turned white.
“Samuel, book a flight to Zupren immediately.”
Samuel had overheard most of the conversation, and his expression was just as grave.
gα?ησν?s?com is full of thrilling adventures
“I’ll do it right away.”
Then he hurried out of the office without a second to waste.
Sadie ended the call and tried to stand, but as soon as she did, the room swayed around her.
She clutched the edge of her desk in a bid to steady herself.
Her vision was blurred with tears, but she stubbornly refused to let them fall.
She absolutely refused to believe that Noah had left her like this.
The hospital must have made a mistake. She had to see for herself, to find out what truly happened.
Her plane landed in Zupren at four the following morning.
Sadie disembarked quickly, her face covered with dark, wide sunglasses.
Samuel followed closely behind her.
They exited the airport and got into a car.
“My condolences, Ms. Hudson,” Samuel said softly.
Sadie said nothing, her mind still a chaotic mess of thoughts and memories.
She kept seeing scenes from her first meeting with Noah, and all the moments they had shared—both the good and the bad.noveldrama
They didn’t seem all that long ago.
And now he was dead?
No, she refused to believe it.
.
.
.
###Chapter 660:
It didn’t take long before they were pulling up in front of Rosewood Hospital.
The entrance was under tight security.
Sadie and Samuel had to give a lengthy explanation before they were allowed access to the building.
Inside, the hallways were silent and almost empty.
Samuel approached the reception desk and explained their purpose for visiting.
After verifying their identities, the staff member led them to an office door.
“Dr. Lopez is waiting for you inside,” she said politely before taking her leave.
Sure enough, a middle-aged doctor in a white lab coat and gold-rimmed glasses was waiting for them on the other side of the door.
He stood up and extended his hand to Sadie.
“Hello, Ms. Hudson. My name is Ansel Lopez. I was Mr. Wall’s attending physician here at Rosewood Hospital.”
Sadie shook his hand once.
“It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Lopez. I need to know—where is Noah right now?”
Ansel’s expression was a cross between regret and sympathy.
“I’m very sorry. We did everything we could, but Mr. Wall was ultimately brain-dead, and we couldn’t revive him.”
Sadie’s heart, which had been hanging in suspense all this time, suddenly plummeted into a dark abyss.
She felt her body grow colder by the second, as if she, too, had died.
She lunged over the desk and grabbed Ansel’s arm.
“Where is he?” she demanded. “I need to see him!”

The doctor shook his head.
“Mr. Wall’s body was sent for cremation this morning. You may collect the ashes in an hour or two.”
Cremated?
Ashes?
Sadie was frozen on the spot.noveldrama
That was impossible.
She hadn’t even seen him one last time, hadn’t said her goodbyes.
How could they cremate him without informing her first?
Sadie finally broke down.
Her hands traveled up to clutch Ansel’s collar.
“How can you cremate him without his family’s approval?” she screamed in his face while shaking him. “Liar! I don’t believe a word you just said!”
Tears were streaming down her face, her shoulders shaking as she sobbed and choked on her words.
Ansel tried to step back, startled by Sadie’s outburst.
“Please calm down, Ms. Hudson.”
“It was part of the agreement that was signed upon Mr. Wall’s admission—his body would be cremated immediately after he passed away,” Ansel said. “I assure you, it was all in accordance with the hospital’s regulations.”
Agreement?
Sadie shoved Ansel aside and stumbled out of his office.

Message from Noah: Nice weednesday dear ones! Tomorrow I’m gonna publish two new novels on gal. God loves you and Noah whishes you all the best. (?O?=)? ?

###Chapter 661:
She wandered aimlessly down the corridor, her eyes dead and vacant.
“I don’t believe it,” she muttered under her breath. “It can’t be true…”
Sadie refused to believe that Noah would leave her, just like that.
She needed to find him. She would search every corner of the world if she had to.
Meanwhile, Ansel straightened himself and waved at the security guards stationed nearby.
Without a word, they stepped forward and escorted both Sadie and Samuel out of the hospital.
Samuel could do nothing more than watch Sadie’s despair unfold before him.
He was just as devastated, and just as powerless to do anything.
Just then, his phone rang. It was Tina.
“Mr. Ford, the people from the Burgess Group will be here at any minute. Where is Ms. Hudson?” Tina sounded anxious over the line.
Samuel glanced at the distraught Sadie beside him and let out a heavy sigh.
“I’m sorry, Tina. I’m afraid today won’t work. Ms. Hudson is currently in Zupren, dealing with a pressing emergency. The meeting will have to be postponed.”
Tina also sighed, though hers was one of resignation.
She quickly looked for the director of the marketing department and relayed the sudden development.
The man was visibly taken aback by the news.noveldrama
How could Sadie be absent for such an important meeting?
Left with no choice, the director braced himself and led his team to the building entrance.
A few minutes later, a convoy of luxury cars cruised through the driveway and stopped in front of the Wall Group.
Check what’s new on g?lnσvs?c?m
Hailey stepped out of the first car.
She had made sure to dress sharply today, picking out a white business suit that accentuated her fine features.
She wound her arm around that of the man beside her and leaned into him with obvious affection.
The man wore a silver mask that concealed most of his face. Only the chiseled cut of his jaw and the firm set of his lips were exposed. Despite this, there was no mistaking his distinguished aura. He didn’t even say anything, and already, he became the center of everyone’s attention.
The director approached with an awkward smile.
“Welcome, Ms. Burgess, Mr. Noel. Thank you for coming all this way.”
His tone was polite, his posture humble. This was only natural, of course, considering Sadie’s absence.
“I deeply apologize, but Ms. Hudson had to attend to an urgent matter overseas. I’m afraid your meeting needs to be postponed.”
The director was cautious all throughout.
Beneath his mask, Noah’s brows immediately knitted into a frown.
This woman… did she actually not care about their business collaboration?
The thought came with a surge of fresh anger. His already terrible impression of Sadie only worsened.
“If Ms. Hudson doesn’t value this business prospect, then we might as well end any semblance of partnership here.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 662:
Before anyone could react, Noah broke away from Hailey and turned on his heel. The next thing they knew, he was back inside the car.
Hailey hurried after him, while the director stood frozen in place.
Standing beside him, Tina was just as struck as she stared blankly at the car Patrick had disappeared into.
Why did his voice sound so much like Noah’s?
No, she must be mistaken. It was impossible.
Noah was still in the hospital.
None of them noticed a low-level staff member retreating to an inconspicuous corner of the lobby. He took out his phone and dialed a number.
“Mr. Wall, Mr. Noel and Ms. Burgess have left the company. They are very displeased with Ms. Hudson’s absence, and it looks like the collaboration has completely fallen through.”
In the logistics department manager’s office, Sutton’s lips slowly curled into a devious smile.
He wasn’t expecting Sadie to sabotage the collaboration herself. He didn’t even have to lift a finger.
Even though she was Absolon’s granddaughter, there was no way she wouldn’t face backlash after losing such a lucrative business partnership.
Sutton was instantly in high spirits.
“Excellent. Be sure to spread this information around the company. I want everyone in the Wall Group to know. Let’s see how she handles this.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall.”
The staff member hung up and went on to do exactly as he was instructed.

At a suburban villa, Noah headed straight to his study after he got home. He approached the floor-to-ceiling window and lit a cigarette, the glow near his fingertips illuminating the room. The taste of nicotine filled his lungs, soothing the unrest in his heart. He picked up the phone and dialed.
“Find out where Sadie went.”
Within ten minutes, he had an answer.
“Mr. Noel, Ms. Hudson went to Zupren.”
Zupren? Noah paused, surprised.noveldrama
Why would she suddenly go to Zupren?
“Find out what she’s up to there and report back to me.” After hanging up, Noah furrowed his brow. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was losing grip on something.
Someone knocked on the study door.
“Come in,” he said indifferently.
Hailey entered with a glass of red wine, smiling warmly.
“Noah, the day must have exhausted you. Relax a little.”
Noah accepted the wine but set it down on the table next to him. “Hailey, is there something you need?” he asked, his voice still distant but polite.
“Noah, even though we married abroad, I’ve heard the wedding customs here are quite different. What if we had another ceremony?” Hailey’s eyes shone with hope as she looked up at him.
Noah’s mind was elsewhere.
“Okay,” he responded, distracted.
.
.
.
###Chapter 663:
At his agreement, Hailey’s face lit up with joy.
“Really? Noah, you are so sweet!”
Excited, Hailey hurried out to start planning the ceremony. She was eager to have her status as Noah’s wife acknowledged at home too!
Noah massaged his temples, feeling as if he had forgotten something important. A wedding ceremony? Why did he feel like he had already had one here?
Two days later, at Jazmah Airport, Sadie clutched a box, looking exhausted. She stepped out from the VIP passage, her slender figure cloaked in a black coat, appearing even more delicate.
“Ms. Hudson,” Samuel hurried to her side and said, “Everything is prepared at the Wall Manor.”
Sadie nodded and gently caressed the box in her arms.
“Noah, we are back.”
As she settled into the car, it slowly pulled away from the airport. Sadie stared out the window, her eyes vacant and forlorn. The cityscape rolled by, unchanged from when she left. But the person she had loved deeply was gone.
As the car pulled into Wall Manor, Sadie noticed that the funeral preparations were complete. White roses contributed to the solemn atmosphere.
Isabel’s eyes filled with tears when she saw the urn Sadie was carrying. “Noah…”
Gently, Sadie patted her back. Although Sadie’s eyes burned, she fought the tears. Now was not the time for crying. There was still much to do.
Isabel took Sadie’s hand and led her into the living room, where Noah’s portrait was prominently displayed. In the photo, Noah’s eyes were kind, and his smile slight. He was truly gone.noveldrama
Isabel wept for a while before she began to settle down.
She grasped Sadie’s hand and sat beside her. “Sadie, you’ve been through so much these past days. You must be exhausted.” Her voice was raspy with deep concern.
Fresh content available now gα?ησv?s?com
Sadie shook her head. “Isabel, I’m fine.”
“Poor girl…” Isabel understood that Sadie was maintaining a strong front, yet her grief was likely more profound than anyone could know. “If you need to cry, just let it out,” Isabel said, her expression filled with worry. “Don’t hold it back.”
Sadie shook her head again. “I can’t cry yet. The Wall Group and Averi still need me. I can’t fall apart.”
Tears filled Isabel’s eyes as she squeezed Sadie’s hand. “You’re such a strong child.”
Sadie looked down, remaining silent.
The funeral was ready. She stayed beside the urn, never leaving. She didn’t eat, drink, or speak. She just stood vigil quietly.
Isabel, worried for Sadie’s health, kept urging her to rest. But Sadie refused, shaking her head.
She was exhausted. Yet she didn’t dare to rest. She feared that resting would make her crumble completely.
Eventually, the mental and physical strain overwhelmed Sadie. She became dizzy and fell to the floor. As she lost consciousness, it seemed she saw Noah. He was still smiling gently, reaching out to her.
“Sadie, come to me,” he said.
Slowly, Sadie closed her eyes, a faint smile of relief on her face. Perhaps this was for the best.
.
.
.
###Chapter 664:
“Sadie has fainted! Call an ambulance!”
The following morning, Sadie woke up in the hospital. Her body ached, and she felt completely drained. She still couldn’t come to terms with Noah’s death.
Suddenly, the door to her hospital room burst open. Samuel entered hastily upon seeing her awake.
“Ms. Hudson, there’s trouble at the company,” he said urgently. “Three days ago, Mr. Noel and Ms. Burgess visited the Wall Group, but you weren’t there. Mr. Noel left immediately, and now the whole company knows. The shareholders are meeting today, and they seem prepared to confront you.”
Sadie’s fog of confusion cleared. The Wall Group was Noah’s, Absolon’s, and Nigel’s legacy. She was determined to defend it.
She sat up, swung her legs off the bed, and slipped on her shoes. “Let’s go to the company,” she declared.
Samuel nodded, and they hurried back to the Wall Group.
Upon arrival, they found Tina directing a subordinate. Spotting Sadie, Tina quickly came over.
“Sadie, be cautious. Coyle has just arrived as well.”
Sadie acknowledged the warning with a slight nod. She took the elevator directly to the floor where the meeting room was.
The sounds of dispute were audible even through the closed door.
“Ms. Hudson’s disregard for the company is unacceptable!”
“The loss of such a crucial partnership is purely due to negligence!”
“I propose we remove Sadie from her position as chairperson!”
It was Coyle’s voice.
Samuel, overhearing this, began to sweat.
Sadie maintained her composure and pushed open the conference room door. The room instantly fell silent.
Under the scrutinizing eyes of everyone present, Sadie walked confidently to the head of the table. Despite her pallor, her stance was firm. She looked around at the shareholders, her gaze finally resting on Coyle. A faint, mocking smile appeared on her lips.
“Coyle, it seems you’re quite keen to see me removed from my position. I presume you have a replacement in mind?” She paused, her tone lightly sarcastic. “Or is it perhaps you?”
Her words, tinged with irony, charged the atmosphere with tension and confrontation.
Coyle’s face turned a shade of red. He was both angry and embarrassed. He hadn’t expected Sadie to be so forthright, stripping him of any pretense of dignity.
“Well…” He coughed, attempting to alleviate the tension. “I’m merely acting in the company’s best interests. It’s a necessary measure.” His words carried a superficial righteousness.
He added after a brief pause, “Three days ago, Mr. Noel from the Burgess Group made the effort to come here, and you, Sadie, failed to meet him. This caused him to leave. Surely, this demands an explanation? If you’re too preoccupied to manage the company, as a senior member, I’m prepared to step in.”
Coyle’s tone seemed concerned, as if he genuinely cared for the company’s welfare. He subtly boasted about his own capabilities, suggesting he was a more suitable chairperson.
Listening to his drivel, Sadie couldn’t resist clapping. The sharp sound echoed starkly in the silent conference room. An elderly shareholder, who had been quiet, sighed regretfully. “Sadie, this time you’ve gone too far.”
The older shareholders beside him looked similarly disappointed. They had once believed Absolon’s granddaughter could steer the Wall Group effectively. Now, they doubted their judgment.
Sadie took a moment, knowing all eyes were on her, then stood and addressed the room with confidence. “Give me three days. I’ll personally restore our partnership with the Burgess Group.”
She added, her voice gaining intensity, “If I don’t succeed within three days, I will step down as chairperson myself.” Her bold declaration stirred the room.noveldrama
Nobody had anticipated such a forthright challenge from Sadie.
Coyle was taken aback; he hadn’t expected her audacity.
Three days seemed too short a timeframe for her to devise a plan. He decided to wait and see how Sadie would manage.
Coyle managed a forced smile. “Since Sadie has made her position clear, we’ll await her good news.” The other shareholders exchanged looks, the mood turning slightly awkward. But ultimately, they agreed.
As the meeting adjourned, Sadie suddenly said, “Coyle, please stay.”
Coyle stopped, turning with a confused look. “Do you have something else to say?” His tone was hostile, edged with challenge. “Or are you ready to concede defeat?”
Sadie responded with a frosty laugh. She walked up to Coyle, her gaze fixed on him. “The head of the Wall family has passed, a major event for us all. As a member of the family, you ought to have paid your respects,” Sadie’s voice was cold. “We had arranged for the funeral and notified you, yet you chose not to attend. Are you considering distancing yourself from us?” Her tone was pointed.
Coyle trembled with rage, his fists clenched tightly. His complexion paled, and his breathing grew heavy. He was incensed by her boldness to confront him so openly. She was clearly challenging his dignity.
Before he could retaliate, Sadie added, “If you fail to show up today, I’ll announce tomorrow morning that you and your kids are no longer part of the Wall family.”
With those final words, she turned and exited without looking back.
Silence enveloped the conference room once again. The other shareholders exchanged uneasy glances, none wanting to be the first to speak.
At that moment, Coyle’s assistant approached him cautiously.
.
.
.
###Chapter 665:
“Mr. Wall, shall we return to Wall Manor now?” the assistant asked quietly.
Coyle, seething with anger, abruptly lifted his cane and struck the assistant’s leg harshly.
“Do you need to ask that? Didn’t you hear her say she would remove us from the family if we don’t return to the Wall Manor?”noveldrama
The assistant grimaced in pain but remained silent, quickly wheeling Coyle out of the meeting room.
Coyle tried to curb his fury, reassuring himself. Noah was gone, and Sadie would likely resign as chairwoman in three days. Then, he would see if she remained so bold!
Meanwhile, Sadie was back in her office.
“Ms. Hudson, was that too impulsive in the meeting?” Samuel inquired, his tone laced with concern.
They hadn’t figured out the situation with Patrick yet, and promising a resolution in three days was a gamble.
What if they failed?
Sadie understood his worries and sighed.

“Do we have any other option to keep the shareholders in check?”
Samuel fell silent. They were indeed cornered, with no room to retreat.
Just then, Tina entered with a document.
“Sadie, here’s Mr. Noel’s schedule for the next week. Hailey has been in contact with Sutton, but Mr. Noel hasn’t made any moves.”
Sadie quickly reviewed the document.
“Go to Colnoque and bring Mr. Castro back to the Wall Group,” she instructed Samuel.
Samuel grasped her plan immediately. Sadie was trying to secure a backup.
Ralph Castro had been a quiet supporter for the past three years and was an original member of the Wall Group, alongside Nigel and…
Absolon.
If things didn’t work out with Patrick, Ralph’s return would ease the situation.
“Understood, Ms. Hudson,” Samuel replied, recognizing the urgency as he departed swiftly.
Exhausted, Sadie leaned back, her eyes closing as the weight of recent events pressed on her. She massaged her temples, trying to find some calm. Now was not the time for grief.
Secluding herself in her office, she tirelessly worked through documents to distract herself from her sorrow.
Concerned for Sadie’s well-being, Tina poured a cup of coffee, knocked gently, and stepped inside.
“Sadie, take a break. You’ve been working non-stop,” Tina whispered gently.
Sadie looked up, her expression weary yet determined.
“Thanks, Tina, but I’m fine,” she replied.
Then, something seemed to click in her memory.
“Actually, prepare to join me at the Glory Jewelry Exhibition later. I remembered Mr. Noel is expected to be there.”
Tina nodded and began organizing Sadie’s files.
As they were about to leave, Samuel called.
“Ms. Hudson, Mr. Castro has agreed to come back,” he announced, his voice tinged with excitement. “He’s already en route and will be in Jazmah by tomorrow morning.”

###Chapter 666:
The news slightly eased Sadie’s strained nerves.
“Good. Thanks, Samuel.”
“Oh, and one more thing,” Samuel added quickly, as though he had just remembered. “Mr. Castro is bringing an old friend along as a surprise for you.”
Sadie was intrigued. Her mind teemed with questions, but she decided to wait until the next day for answers.
Sadie and Tina then arrived at the Glory Jewelry Exhibition.
Rachael Howard, the organizer, greeted her with a playful remark.
“Sadie? I thought you were too busy for my little exhibition.”
Sadie smiled, remembering their time at the international jewelry competition three years earlier.
“I managed to make some time today,” she responded sincerely.
“I was only teasing. I’m thrilled you’re here,” Rachael said before linking arms with Sadie. “Let me show you around.”
As they walked, Sadie gave Tina a discreet look. Tina caught on immediately and veered off in a different direction. The exhibition venue was expansive, and as Rachael guided her through it, Sadie responded to her chatter with only half her attention. Her gaze continually swept over the crowd, but she saw no sign of the man she was looking for.
ga?ν.kn –    ?
Just as she was about to give up, a man wearing a silver mask entered.
His tall, commanding presence instantly drew her attention.
Sadie’s heart fluttered, her pulse quickening. She stared, unable to believe her eyes. Despite the mask, the man’s bearing and build were eerily reminiscent of Noah.
It had been three years. She had believed she would never see him again.
Driven by her emotions, Sadie hurried toward him. Nothing mattered except confirming whether the man was truly Noah.
She reached out and took hold of his arm, her voice quivering.
“Noah?”
He turned to face her, his expression distant and cold, as though he were regarding a stranger.
A slight frown creased his brow, indicating his displeasure at her forwardness.
Tina noticed the scene, taken aback for a moment, before quickly approaching Sadie.
She spoke in a hushed tone. “That’s Patrick.”
Rachael, observing Sadie’s reaction, approached with a playful smile.
“Sadie, do you know Patrick too?”
Sadie remained silent, her eyes beginning to well up.
It was Noah.
It had to be him.
She was certain she would never mistake anyone else for him!
Under her intense stare, Noah appeared slightly uncomfortable. He looked at Sadie’s hand, which was holding his arm, not seeming to mind.
It felt odd to him.
Trying to compose himself, he spoke in a detached tone. “Ms. Hudson, holding my arm so openly might be viewed as inappropriate here, don’t you think?”
His words only deepened Sadie’s sense of déjà vu.noveldrama
That voice was unmistakably Noah’s.
“Who are you, really?” she pressed, unable to contain her confusion.
.
.
.
###Chapter 667:
Noah’s patience waned, and he withdrew his arm sharply, his voice chilling. “Ms. Hudson, you gave up the partnership with the Burgess Group yourself. What is this about now?” With that, he turned and walked away.
Rachael, who had been watching the exchange, gently patted Sadie’s shoulder and sighed. “I met Patrick while hosting an exhibition abroad.” Knowing the story between Sadie and Noah, she assumed Sadie was distraught because she had mistaken someone else for Noah.
“People often say they look alike,” Rachael tried to comfort her. “But Patrick is not Noah. I heard he’s married. Sadie, try not to dwell on the past too much. I need to return to my duties.” With that, Rachael left.
Standing there, Sadie felt a whirl of confusion engulf her.
She tried to remember Patrick’s voice, his manner, how he carried himself—all strikingly similar to her memories of Noah.
If he wasn’t Noah, then who was he?noveldrama
She couldn’t understand.
She was determined to uncover whether Patrick was indeed Noah. The next thing she knew, Sadie was in the car, her mind a torrent of thoughts.
Check what’s new on g@lnovs.c○m
Tina, noticing her pale face and trembling lips, spoke cautiously. “Sadie, try not to let this get to you.”
Sadie simply shook her head, signaling that she was alright, though her mind was far from calm.
“Keep looking,” Sadie said softly, her voice quivering slightly. “If we find nothing here, we’ll hire a detective in Zupren.”
“Alright, I’ll handle it immediately.”
Tina nodded and promptly made a phone call.
Sadie rested her head against the car window, her eyes hollow as she watched the city blur by.
Over the past three years, Noah had appeared in her dreams countless times.
In those dreams, he smiled gently and reached out to her.
But each time she awoke, she was met with the stark chill of reality. Could it be that she missed Noah so much that she was seeing things and thought Patrick resembled him?
Closing her eyes, Sadie tried to steady her nerves.
Yet, her heart pounded relentlessly, refusing to be calmed.
Meanwhile, back at his suburban villa, Noah removed his mask.
His features were still handsome, albeit marked by weariness.
Hailey greeted him as he entered.
“Noah, you’re back,” she said softly. “Weren’t you at the jewelry exhibition? Why did you come back so soon? Oh, and I’ve been meaning to ask—what are your thoughts on Coyle and his son?” She posed the question tentatively, her eyes keenly observing his reaction.
Noah scowled, annoyed by the memory of the woman who had clung to him at the exhibition.
“Coyle and his son are going nowhere,” he replied indifferently, his gaze distant. “Sadie has even managed to dominate them for three years.”
Hailey nodded, her expression thoughtful.
“So, should we still choose to work with Sadie?” she asked.
At the mention of Sadie, Noah’s expression darkened further.
Her conduct at the exhibition had taken him by surprise.
She didn’t match the rumors.
.
.
.
###Chapter 668:
The mix of sadness and excitement in her eyes seemed genuine.
Hailey handed him a document casually.
“Noah, here’s a list of ongoing projects at the Wall Group. I managed to obtain it for you.”
Noah looked at the document, his brow furrowing.
“How did you get this?”
“I have my ways,” she said with a hint of mystery. “Don’t ask. Just take a look.”
Noah didn’t press further and carried the document upstairs.
Hailey poured herself a glass of red wine, a self-satisfied smirk on her lips.
Her phone rang.
It was Sutton.
“Sutton, what’s up?” she answered, her tone nonchalant.
Sutton’s deep voice resonated through the phone.
“Hailey, remember your promise to me.”
Find your next adventure at gα ?η σ ν ?s?com
She frowned, clearly annoyed.
“Sure, I remember,” she responded.
With a few dismissive words, she ended the call.
Sutton had outlived his usefulness to her.
She had already secured the necessary insider information from the Wall Group.
Now, all she needed was time to play her cards right.
On the other end, Sutton seethed with anger.
This woman, who had once been so reliant on him three years ago, now treated him with cold indifference.
His chest heaved with anger as he grabbed a pack of cigarettes from the table, lit one, and inhaled deeply, letting the nicotine calm his fury.
Hailey was becoming increasingly dismissive of him.
If she weren’t still of some use, he would have cut ties with her long ago.
Just then, the door opened.
Seeing Coyle return with a grim look, Sutton cautiously walked over.
” Dad, what happened?”
Coyle remained silent, his face set in a stern expression.
Sutton immediately sensed something was wrong, a sense of dread weighing heavily on him.
Then, his phone vibrated with a news notification.
It announced that Coyle had been to Wall Manor to honor Noah with a solemn tribute.
The accompanying photo showed Coyle looking somber and respectful.
A wave of anger surged through Sutton.
In a fit of fury, he threw his phone to the floor, shattering the screen.
“Sadie has gone too far!” Sutton exclaimed, his voice sharp with anger. He couldn’t accept it. Now, the whole city knew his father had bowed his head before Noah— a complete humiliation.
Coyle’s face grew even darker at Sutton’s outburst.
“Shut up!” he roared.
Sutton recoiled, silenced by his father’s explosive temper.
Coyle’s breathing was heavy with rage.
He had not anticipated Sadie would publicly humiliate him like this. Such a disgrace was unprecedented in his life.
.

###Chapter 669:
He fought to control his anger.
This was not the time for rash actions.
Focusing on more pressing matters, he turned to Sutton with an icy tone.
“What’s the status with our deal with the Burgess Group?”
Sutton, feeling uneasy, knew he couldn’t reveal Hailey’s indifferent response.
He mustered his composure and responded, “All is going well.”
Coyle eyed him and then nodded, apparently appeased.
“The deal with the Burgess Group must succeed,” he said firmly. “And tell Briley to speed things up.”
“Yes, I understand.” Sutton bowed his head, concealing the worry in his eyes.
Coyle dismissed him with a wave.
Sutton felt a momentary sense of relief as he quickly left the room. As soon as the door shut behind him, he exhaled deeply, feeling the cold sweat soaking his back.
He knew he had to find a way to manage Hailey effectively. He couldn’t let Sadie enjoy her triumph for too long. Eventually, he was determined to reclaim everything he believed was rightfully his.
Meanwhile, after a day’s work, Sadie returned to Wall Manor.
  : g?ν.con
Alex was already at the entrance when Sadie arrived.
As her car pulled up, he stepped forward.
“Sadie, my condolences,” he said, his voice filled with concern. He had heard about the recent events and wanted to offer her a comforting embrace, but he hesitated, unsure of her reception.
“Try not to dwell in sorrow for too long. The dead can’t return. I know it’s hard, but if you need anything, I’m here for you.”
He paused, then added more softly yet with resolve, “I’ll always be here for you.”
For the past three years, Alex had been a constant presence by Sadie’s side.noveldrama
Now, with Noah gone, he wondered if his opportunity had finally arisen.
“Sadie, I’ve heard about the trouble with the Burgess Group,” he began, then hesitated before making a bold suggestion. “If you’d consider it—I mean, only if you think it’s right—I could marry you. A union between us could deter any further schemes.”
Alex knew his proposal might appear opportunistic, but he couldn’t wait.
He hoped to be more than just a friend; he wanted to be Sadie’s partner for life.
Sadie looked momentarily taken aback.
She met his gaze, her eyes calm and distant.
“Alex, thank you,” she said gently. “I appreciate your sincerity and all that you’ve done these last three years. But I cannot accept your proposal.”
Her tone was firm, resolute.
While grateful for what Alex had done for her, she did not love him.
It wouldn’t be right to marry out of gratitude.
“You’ve been a true friend. I need to handle the company issues myself. But thank you, really. Don’t worry about me.”
She then turned and walked into Wall Manor without looking back.
Alex stood there, a bitter smile playing on his lips.
He should have realized Sadie’s heart was still with Noah. Despite his best efforts, he couldn’t bridge the distance to her heart. A sense of defeat and helplessness washed over him.
Meanwhile, unnoticed in the shadows, a sleek red sports car sat parked. Briley, inside the driver’s seat, had watched the exchange quietly. She hadn’t expected Alex’s deep devotion, much less a marriage proposal in such circumstances. How utterly romantic!
.
.
.
###Chapter 670:
How did Sadie manage to attract such fortune? First with Noah, and now Alex? Both men were exceptional and devoted to her. What was her secret?
The more Briley dwelled on it, the more a bitter jealousy coiled within her, her resentment festering.
She craved what Sadie had—the adoration and attention of two remarkable men.
As Alex drove away, Briley prepared to follow, hoping for a chance to draw closer to him when her phone interrupted her thoughts.
It was her brother, Sutton.
With a frown, she answered, her voice tinged with annoyance.
“What now, Sutton?”noveldrama
“Briley, have you made any progress with Alex? I told you we need him on our side quickly.”
Sutton’s authoritative voice pressed through the speaker.
Her irritation spiked at his urging.
“I’m aware, Sutton! Don’t pressure me,” she retorted sharply. “I’m handling it. Just give me some time—he’ll be mine soon enough.”

Briley ended the call brusquely.
However, Sutton was not easily deceived. He could detect the impatience in her response.
“Briley, I’m telling you again, this is critical for our family,” Sutton said, his voice lowering to convey a serious warning. “Make sure you’re focused and don’t botch this like last time.”
The previous debacle had brought embarrassment to both Briley and their father, tarnishing their reputation within the family. This time, Sutton was adamant that there would be no errors.
Taken aback by Sutton’s stern tone, Briley softened her voice to reassure him.
“Sutton, relax. I won’t let you down this time. Just wait for my good news,” she replied confidently.
Sutton’s demeanor eased slightly when he heard his sister’s promise.
“Good,” he said before ending the call.
Briley ignited her sports car, tracing the route Alex had taken.
Under the late-night sky, neon lights flickered, casting their glow. The Night Owl Bar, a haven of indulgence, pulsed with the rhythm of music, its dance floor alive with the sway of men and women. In a secluded corner, a solitary figure nursed his drink, his posture betraying a sense of isolation.
It was Alex.
Glass after glass, he sought solace in the burn of alcohol, yet it provided no relief from the frustration boiling within him.
Once more, Sadie had refused him.
Was he destined to merely watch as she slipped further away?
Then, a figure approached, her movements hushed.
Briley eased into the seat next to Alex, ordering a drink while her gaze lingered on his profile, striking even in the dim light.
The moment she had been waiting for had arrived.
With her heart racing, a faint blush tinged her cheeks.
She reached out hesitantly, her fingers grazing Alex’s hand with a delicate touch.
Unresponsive, lost in his thoughts, Alex gave no indication he noticed. Briley was emboldened, her touch becoming more suggestive, her fingers tracing his hand with a gentle persuasion.
At last, Alex looked up, his eyes bleary from the alcohol, his focus drifting as he tried to make out her face.

.
###Chapter 671:
“Alex, don’t be sad,” Briley murmured, her voice full of tenderness.
She enveloped his hand in hers, her grip comforting.
His gaze, clouded and uncertain in the low light, struggled to identify her.
In his drunken state, he mistook her for Sadie.
Was it really her?
“Sadie?” Alex murmured.
Suddenly, he gripped Briley’s hand with surprising force.
A thrill of joy surged through Briley.
He had fallen for it! It didn’t matter that he had mistaken her for another woman.
She chose not to correct him. Instead, she leaned in, her body nearly touching his.
“It’s me, Alex.”
Engulfed in the fog of alcohol, Alex struggled to recognize the person before him.
All he knew was that he saw Sadie—the woman who haunted his every thought, the one he deeply missed.
For mr?, vt glov?ls.○
“Sadie, don’t leave me.”
Alex’s voice, filled with a childlike fear of abandonment, made him cling to Briley.
Briley initially tensed at his embrace but quickly composed herself.
A subtle, triumphant smile played across her lips.
She soothed Alex by gently patting his back.
“I won’t, Alex. I won’t leave you.”
Alex’s embrace tightened, his grip strong.
He buried his face in the crook of Briley’s neck, breathing deeply, taking in her scent.
Over and over, he whispered, “Don’t leave me, Sadie, don’t leave me.”
Briley let him hold her, her smile growing more seductive, laced with excitement.
For many women, being embraced by a man like Alex was a dream.
Now, she had effortlessly made it a reality.noveldrama
Alex stayed in Briley’s arms for a long time.
Eventually, the alcohol took full control.
He drifted into a deep sleep, his breaths heavy and irregular.
Briley felt his body relax completely in her embrace, and she carefully helped him sit up.
His weight was a challenge to manage.
She managed to take Alex to a nearby hotel, and with effort, placed him onto a soft bed.
He remained unresponsive.
Briley took in the lavish suite, noting every luxurious detail.
Feeling satisfied, she retrieved her phone from her bag and captured several suggestive photos of Alex and herself on the bed.
She chose her angles carefully and used the dim lighting to enhance the allure of the images.
After securing the photos, she stowed her phone away, a playful smirk playing across her lips.
These images would give her leverage.
“Alex, you won’t escape me,” she murmured.
Briley turned to leave the room.
As she reached the door, a sudden movement from behind made her pause.
Alex had awoken.
.
.
.
###Chapter 672:
Her heart raced as she quickly turned back.
He was sitting up in bed, his eyes clouded with confusion and the remnants of sleep.
When he saw Briley near the door, panic flared in his expression.
“Sadie, where are you going?” he called out, his voice tinged with anxiety.
He leapt from the bed and stumbled toward Briley.
Caught off guard, Briley stood frozen, unable to move as he reached her and forcefully pushed her back onto the bed.
The room seemed to spin as she landed on the soft mattress.
The heat of Alex’s body pressed against hers, his breaths quick and ragged, the sharp scent of alcohol mixing with the palpable tension in the air.
“Sadie, this time I won’t let you leave me.”
Briley was stunned, and her mind went completely blank.
She hadn’t expected Alex to react this way after waking up.
 ?  ? ν﹒
His handsome face was so close to hers, his warm breath fanning her cheeks. She was enveloped in his unique masculine scent, making her heart race even faster.
The next thing she knew, Alex was kissing her.
It was a gentle kiss, a cautious exploration. It was completely different from the kisses she had had with the boorish, self-centered men she had dated in the past.
This was new to Briley, and she was utterly captivated.
Whatever thoughts remained in her head flew out the window, her entire rationality broken by that kiss.
She couldn’t help herself from closing her eyes and kissing him back.
“Alex,” Briley whispered, her voice soft and alluring.
She gazed at the man in front of her, her eyes brimming with desire and affection.
“I want you…”
Alex’s breath caught, his eyes suddenly ablaze with lust. His control seemed to snap right on the spot as he growled, “Sadie.” Then, he went on to have sex with Briley.
When morning came, the beams of sunlight that filtered through the room were harsh and punishing. Alex’s brows furrowed as he slowly blinked his eyes open.
His head was still pounding from the alcohol, but something felt different about his body.
Then he turned his head to the side and was greeted by an unfamiliar face.
All at once, memories of the previous night came rushing back to him—the bar, all the alcohol, and the warm body against his.
Alex’s face turned dark.
He sat up abruptly before shoving the woman beside him away.
Briley was still deep in slumber at that point, but she was rudely awakened when she rolled to the edge of the bed and eventually fell. She whimpered upon impact, and when she sat up, she was met with Alex’s back.
Her face broke into a shy smile as she recalled what had happened between them the previous night.
“Alex,” Briley called out softly, making sure she injected just enough sweetness and seduction into her voice.noveldrama
But Alex seemed oblivious to her presence. He shot out of bed and began to dress, his movements brisk and decisive.
Briley’s smile froze. Something was not right.
.
.
.
###Chapter 673:
She climbed back into bed, holding the covers against her chest.
“Alex, what’s wrong?”
Alex finally turned around to face her, but his face was livid. Without warning, he lunged and grabbed her by the throat. His eyes glinted with murderous intent, echoed by the tightness of his grip.
Briley’s eyes practically popped out of their sockets from shock. She clawed at his hand, her face already bright red from the loss of air.
“Didn’t I tell you not to use such underhanded tactics?” Alex said, his voice low and thrumming with danger.
Briley began to claw at his arm, but no matter how much she struggled, she couldn’t move him.
She opened her mouth to try to explain, but no sound came out. At last, Alex let go and tossed her aside. His face was filled with disgust, as if he had just touched something filthy. Briley fell onto the bed, coughing violently.
“No,” she choked out, tears streaming down her face. “It’s not what you think! Last night, you were the one who refused to let me go…” But Alex wouldn’t hear any of it.
He tugged at his tie, his expression menacing.
“Enough.” He didn’t want to hear any explanations or see this repulsive woman again. “I’m warning you—if this gets out or if Sadie even hears a peep of this, you won’t live to see another day. Do you understand?”
?  @ g?ν?
Briley shuddered, feeling a raw, genuine kind of fear.
She knew he wasn’t bluffing.
But how could she just forget? She rushed forward and grabbed the hem of his shirt.
“Alex, don’t treat me like this! We’ve spent a night together. Are you really going to just forget about that?”
Briley’s tone was pleading; she hoped to gain at least a smidgen of sympathy from him.
Alex only gave her yet another disdainful glance.
“Do you think you deserve any of my concern?” He forcefully shook off Briley’s hand. “Remember my words and keep your mouth shut.”
With that, he left without a single backward glance.
Briley collapsed on the bed, her facade crumbling. Soon, the pain and humiliation fell away, replaced by an endless sea of resentment.
She clutched at the sheets.
It was all because of that damned Sadie!
If it weren’t for her, Alex wouldn’t treat her this way.
Briley gritted her teeth and swore to herself that she would make Sadie pay for this.noveldrama
At that same moment, Sadie frowned as a prickle of unease washed over her.
She didn’t dwell on it, however, and finished changing her clothes before heading downstairs.
Tina was waiting for her, and she handed over a document, saying, “Updates from the detective in Zupren.”
Sadie carefully read through the report. It was a detailed dossier on Patrick Noel’s past.
Apparently, he was an illegitimate son from the Noel family, and had married Hailey three years ago. When her father, Forest Burgess, resigned as the chairman of the Burgess Group, Patrick took over.
His name and background bore no resemblance to Noah at all.
Sadie sighed. It seemed that she had misunderstood.
.
.
.
###Chapter 674:
Perhaps she was missing Noah so much that she was mistaking a stranger for him now.
Beside her, Tina asked in a careful tone, “What should we do next, Sadie?”
Sadie looked up. Then, her eyes regained their usual clarity.
“We can’t walk away from the collaboration with the Burgess Group. What is Mr. Noel’s schedule for today?”
Tina quickly checked her notebook.
“He is set for a breakfast meeting at the Chroma Cafe this morning.”
“Let’s go, then.”
Gathering her purse and coat, Sadie led the way out, with Tina hurrying after her.noveldrama
They arrived at the Chroma Cafe half an hour later.
Tina was tense throughout the drive, seemingly worried, yet hesitant to speak her mind.
Sadie understood Tina’s worry—Tina feared that she might lose control of her emotions again once she saw Patrick.
After all, his facial features bore an uncanny resemblance to Noah’s.
 ? ?ν.
“Don’t worry, Tina,” Sadie reassured her. “I’m perfectly capable of managing my emotions.”
Getting out of the car, Sadie composed herself, squared her shoulders, and entered the Chroma Cafe.
Her eyes immediately found Patrick. He was sitting by the window, his face mostly hidden behind a silver mask. He sat up straight, ever refined and dignified.
His long fingers were tapping gently against the table, as though he was waiting for someone.
“Good morning, Mr. Noel,” Sadie greeted him as she approached. Her tone was courteous but considerably distant. “Yesterday at the Glory Jewelry Exhibition, it was a huge misunderstanding,” she explained. “I simply confused you with another person.”
Noah glanced up and swept an indifferent gaze over her, as though he had been expecting her to appear.
He showed no reaction to her explanation. Instead, he rose from his seat and picked up the coat draped over the chair beside him.
“Since the misunderstanding is now cleared up,” he said coldly, “you may leave, Ms. Hudson. I have other matters to attend to.” He turned away, only for Sadie to intercept him.
“Please wait, Mr. Noel,” she said, urgently this time. “The Burgess Group is planning to expand into the domestic market, right? I’m sure you wouldn’t settle for anything less than the best of the best to partner up with on your endeavors. And I think we both know that only the Wall Group ticks all your boxes.”
She spoke slowly, enunciating every word to express her conviction.
“You’ve been holding back these past few days, haven’t you? Waiting for me to initiate contact?”
Noah paused at her words.
This woman was clever.
He sat back down, his deep eyes never leaving her face.
“Then how do you propose we go about our collaboration, Ms. Hudson?” he asked, his voice now tinged with interest.
Sadie sighed to herself in relief. Her gamble had paid off.
She settled into the seat across from him, exuding confidence and grace.
“Before anything else, I’d like to apologize for my behavior last time. To make amends, the Wall Group is offering an additional five percent interest on top of the existing terms of the contract. If you are agreeable to this, we can arrange for a business dinner this Friday and finalize the details.”
.

###Chapter 675:
Noah’s eyes narrowed slightly as he scrutinized the woman before him. She was assertive and unwavering, a stark contrast to the timid Sadie he had learned about before returning to the country.
What was more, he felt an odd familiarity toward her, and it annoyed him for some reason.
After a long pause, he finally said, “I look forward to our collaboration.”
Sadie allowed herself to relax then. She had secured the partnership with the Burgess Group.
Her lips curled into a faint smile.
“So do I, Mr. Noel.”
She raised her coffee cup to seal the deal, and Noah picked up his to clink with hers.
“Do you have any other matters to discuss, Ms. Hudson?” he asked casually after taking a sip.
“Well, I heard from the grapevine that Coyle has also reached out to you,” Sadie leaned her elbows on the table and perched her chin on her intertwined fingers. “What are your thoughts?”
Noah raised an eyebrow.
  ? ν?
“What would you like me to do, Ms. Hudson?” he asked point-blank.
Sadie met his gaze steadily.
“You are aware of Coyle’s intentions, Mr. Noel. I only hope that our collaboration proceeds smoothly and conflict-free.”
Noah chuckled lightly, his gaze laden with meaning.
“You want me to reject him?”
“Do you have a reason not to?” Sadie asked with a nonchalant shrug of her shoulders. “You chose us for what we can offer you, not for the sake of insignificant players in the field.”
She caught Noah’s interest now. This woman was more intriguing than he had anticipated.
“You are quite confident, Ms. Hudson.”
“I am not speaking out of personal confidence, I am simply conveying the power of the Wall Group.”
Noah’s eyes flickered with amusement. He did enjoy interacting with intelligent people.
“All right,” he said, not bothering to hide the smile in his voice. “As you wish.”
Sadie beamed. “Thank you, Mr. Noel.”
With everything out of the way, the atmosphere between them lightened significantly.
Sadie pushed her cup away and made to leave. “I’ll see you this Friday, Mr. Noel.”noveldrama
“Ms. Hudson,” Noah suddenly called out before she could take more than two steps away.
Sadie paused and looked back, her brows furrowed with a silent question.
“How about joining me for breakfast?” Noah asked, his tone casual.
Sadie hesitated and glanced at her watch. It was actually too late for breakfast.
But given the conversation they had just had, it seemed rather in bad taste to refuse his invitation.
“Why not?” Sadie sat back down and waved for the waiter, then ordered a few of her favorite brunch items.
Just then, a burst of hearty laughter came from the entrance.
“Patrick! So sorry to keep you waiting!” A man waved enthusiastically at Noah as he barreled into the establishment.

###Chapter 676:
Sadie’s eyes widened in surprise.
Barry Bennett?
Barry was a globally renowned jewelry designer. How did he know Patrick?
The man was before them in an instant, his eyes landing on Sadie. He was stunned for a few seconds before breaking out into a delighted grin.
“Sadie? Is it really you? Oh, goodness!” Barry didn’t hesitate to pull Sadie into a warm hug. “What a coincidence! I didn’t expect to see you here!”
Sadie was taken aback at first, but she recovered quickly.
“Hello, Mr. Bennett.”
Barry smiled and waved a hand. “There’s no need for such formalities. Just call me Barry.”
Then he turned to Noah, and his eyes sparkled with meaning.
“Patrick, you never fail to impress with your exceptional taste.”
Noah cocked his head slightly to the side and said nothing.

Paying him no mind, Barry turned his attention back to Sadie. When he spoke again, his tone was filled with regret.
“Ever since you took over the Wall Group, Sadie, we’ve been feeling the loss of your talents in the design industry. After all, you are Amy’s most accomplished student,” Barry said, shaking his head as he spoke. Then, as if he had just remembered something, he suddenly perked up.
“Patrick, aren’t you and Ms. Burgess planning to hold your wedding here? Why don’t you commission Sadie to design your jewelry pieces? It’s been ages since we last saw her work. I’m sure whatever she makes will be stunning!”
Sadie froze in her seat.
Wedding?
Designing wedding jewelry for Patrick and Hailey…
A sense of discomfort stirred within her, one she could barely define, let alone explain.
“What do you think, Ms. Hudson?” Noah asked, his eyes now on Sadie. The question snapped her back to reality, and she blinked, meeting his gaze.
For the sake of their future business partnership, she swallowed her discomfort and mustered a tight smile.
“It would be my honor.”
Designing jewelry was her forte, and creating wedding pieces for the CEO of the Burgess Group would be an excellent opportunity for the design department’s publicity.
She justified the decision in her mind and ultimately convinced herself that she was doing the right thing.
“Then it’s settled,” Noah said, his tone neutral.
Barry clapped his hands in delight.
“Wonderful! I can guarantee that Sadie’s designs will make your wedding even more perfect!”
He rubbed his hands together, his eyes twinkling as he envisioned the grand event.
Sadie remained polite and said nothing, though she knew how awkward and forced her smile was.
The rest of the meal went on with an underlying tension.noveldrama
Barry was lively and talkative as ever, and he never seemed to run out of design topics to discuss.
Noah would respond occasionally, but his interest was minimal. Sadie would interject now and then, but she was silent for the most part.

###Chapter 677:
When they were done, Barry left in a rush to attend to other engagements, leaving Sadie and Noah alone yet again. However, the atmosphere had turned quiet and heavy.
Sadie’s first instinct was to leave the scene as quickly as she could.
“If there’s nothing else, Mr. Noel, I shall be on my way.”
“Wait,” Noah suddenly called out, surprising both of them. “About the jewelry design… When do you plan to start?”
“As soon as possible, if that’s okay. Do you and Ms. Burgess have any specific requests? Any ideas?”
Noah fell silent for a moment, his gaze growing complex.
“Hailey has always had a penchant for designs that are understated yet graceful. As for me…” He paused, as if thinking it over in his head. “Anything is fine.”
Sadie’s eyes widened slightly. She had expected someone like Patrick to have high demands for something as important as his wedding, but he was just being casual about it.
“I see,” Sadie murmured with a nod. “I’ll draft a preliminary design and send it over for you to look through.”
Noah hummed in acknowledgment and said nothing else.
C?ck ?uthor’s ?o? hr: g?ν?
Sadie bid him farewell again, just to be polite, and he didn’t stop her when she walked away.
Patrick shifted in his seat, his narrowed gaze fixed outside. As he watched Sadie get in the car and drive away, the strange, unknown feeling in his heart grew more pronounced.
What was that just now? Why was he always reluctant to let her go? Why did he always have this nagging sense that she was special to him?
Meanwhile, inside the car, Sadie’s thoughts were in disarray as well. She had gone to meet Patrick to secure the collaboration deal. How did she end up designing his wedding jewelry? More importantly… Was he really not Noah?
Even after seeing all the information on his background laid out in fine detail, Sadie couldn’t shake the feeling that she was missing something. But for the life of her, she didn’t know where to even begin looking.
Sadie leaned back and closed her eyes.
Tina suddenly spoke from the driver’s seat. “Oh, Samuel called earlier, by the way. Mr. Castro has returned home. Should we head straight over?”
Sadie slowly opened her eyes. “Sure.”
She had successfully secured the deal with the Burgess Group, and Ralph was finally back. Surely, that meant only good things ahead of her.
They arrived at Ralph’s house half an hour later.
Sadie knew the place like the back of her hand at this point. She let her feet carry her to the main hall and instantly spotted Ralph in his regal armchair.
“You’re here, Ms. Hudson,” Samuel greeted respectfully.
Ralph looked up. His stern face broke into a warm smile the moment he saw Sadie.
“Sadie, my dear! Come here,” Ralph’s voice was loud and filled with excitement.
Sadie quickly walked to his side and took his hand. “I’ve missed you, Mr. Castro,” she said in a playful tone.noveldrama
Unexpectedly, her words brought tears to the old man’s eyes.
Ralph had been among Sadie’s late grandfather’s closest friends, and after Absolon’s passing, he had presumed that Absolon had no descendants.
He was overjoyed when he met Absolon’s granddaughter three years ago.
Seeing Sadie felt like seeing a very old, very good friend every time.
“I was worried about you,” Ralph confessed as he patted Sadie’s hand. “With Noah passing away, and the company left in turmoil… I didn’t like that you had to face it all alone,” he said, fighting back the tears.
.

###Chapter 678:
Sadie felt her own nose sting, though her chest was suffused with warmth. She knew Ralph truly cared for her.
“You must not worry, Mr. Castro. I’m doing just fine. I’ll handle the company’s matters.”
Ralph looked at her, then nodded in satisfaction.
As expected of Absolon’s granddaughter—of course, she wasn’t an average person!
“Good, good. As long as I am still alive, no one can steal your position as chairwoman!” Ralph’s declaration rang out firmly around the room.
Sadie was moved.
“But I’m getting old,” Ralph continued, his tone softening. “I don’t have much time left.” He paused to heave a long sigh. “I’ve brought back someone from Colnoque with me, someone who can help you.”
Sadie blinked. Ralph’s smile had turned mysterious, leaving her bewildered and a little worried.
Ralph waved his hand and gestured to someone behind him.
“Blaine, come over here!”
C  t glov?ls.○
A man emerged from an adjoining room.
Sadie’s eyes widened slightly when she saw who it was—Blaine Castro, Ralph’s grandson.
He was young and handsome, just as one would expect. But the carefree and seemingly irreverent smile that played on his lips gave the impression that he was more frivolous than ideal.
Blaine grinned and nodded at her in greeting. “Yo, Sadie! How you doing?”
Sadie struggled to keep herself from raising an eyebrow. She wasn’t used to anyone speaking to her in such a flippant manner.
Ralph shot Blaine a disapproving glance. “You rascal, mind your manners!” he scolded, though he didn’t seem genuinely angry. “Don’t take it to heart, Sadie. He meant no offense.”
Sadie smiled and shook her head. “It’s quite all right.”
Ralph hummed and nodded. “Blaine may be a bit loose with his words, but he’s reliable. Keep him by your side, Sadie. If there’s anything you need, you can let him handle it.”
Sadie glanced back and forth between grandfather and grandson.
She knew the old man had only good intentions for her.
“Thank you, Mr. Castro.”
Ralph waved his hand dismissively. “We’re practically family. What’s there to thank me for? In any case, you’ve been standing there for a while now. I’m sure you’re tired. Come sit and rest for a bit.”
Sadie then sat beside him.
Ralph took her hand and asked about the goings-on at the company and in her personal life.noveldrama
She kept her composure as she answered each of his questions. Ralph listened attentively, occasionally expressing his thoughts with a hum or a nod.
“Sadie, why don’t you stay for lunch today?” the old man suggested.
“Keep me company, and we can talk some more.”
Sadie checked the time. “Sure. I appreciate the offer, Mr. Castro.”
“Oh, please. I’m just so glad to have you here,” Ralph said with a chuckle. “Sharing a meal with you is always a delight.”
They had a lavish lunch that day, and their warm, easy conversation continued to flow as they ate.
Ralph never seemed to run out of topics to discuss, and Blaine would chime in here and there with playful banter that made the old man laugh.
.
.
.
###Chapter 679:
Tina and Samuel, on the other hand, ate quietly, responding only when spoken to. All in all, it was a harmonious lunch.
After coffee and dessert, Sadie bid Ralph farewell and took her leave.
He insisted on escorting her to the door, leaving her no room to refuse.
Samuel and Tina were already waiting by the car.
When Blaine sauntered out after his grandfather, his eyes immediately zeroed in on Tina.
“Hey, Miss,” he said, his eyes gleaming with interest. “May I know your name?”
The cocky grin was back on his face as he sidled up next to Tina.
Tina stiffened, visibly taken aback by his sudden attention.
She took a beat to answer, and even then, her tone was reserved.
“My name is Tina Delgado.”
Blaine raised an eyebrow.
“What a charming name. I have a feeling you and I will be great friends.”
Feel the thrill at gα?ησν?s﹒o
He was teasing Tina, causing her to blush and turn away in a fluster.
They drove back to the company, with Blaine in tow.
He maintained that airy demeanor as he walked into the building with his hands in his pockets, making him stand out in the midst of the formal, businesslike atmosphere within the Wall Group.
Sadie cast a sideways glance at him but said nothing. She had grown used to his behavior.
They paused at the reception area, and she finally turned to him.
“Blaine, for the next couple of days, I’d like you to shadow Tina and familiarize yourself with the company’s operations.”
Blaine raised an eyebrow. He glanced at Tina beside him and let out a low whistle.
“I’m sure it will be a pleasure.”noveldrama
Tina felt her face grow hot, but she mustered a small smile.
Sadie could only shake her head in resignation. She hoped that Blaine wouldn’t cause any trouble.
“As for your position,” she continued, “we’ll discuss it after the shareholders’ meeting.”
Blaine shrugged. “Whatever you say. I’m just here to do what you tell me to do.”
Sadie ignored his quip and looked over to Tina. “Take Blaine around to visit the different departments.”
“Understood,” Tina replied before leading Blaine away.
Sadie relaxed, if only a little.
Blaine might act like a dandy, but Ralph had told her that he could be of help, and she trusted the old man. Perhaps this rascal would prove to be capable, after all.
Sadie headed to her office and threw herself into her chair. She was exhausted.
The past few days had been overwhelming, jumping from one task to another before she could even catch her breath. This was a rare moment of respite, and she intended to take advantage of it.
Sadie leaned back and closed her eyes. She slowly kneaded her temples and let the fatigue wash over her.
Later that afternoon, she remembered that Isabel’s birthday was coming up. She had yet to prepare a gift.
So, she grabbed her purse and went to the mall.
The mall always offered a lot of options, and while she found several dazzling items, none grabbed her interest.
.
.
.
###Chapter 680:
Eventually, Sadie found herself at a luxury handbag store.
A particular bag on display caught her eye. It looked simple yet elegant, and she could tell the design was also practical. It was just perfect for Isabel.
Sadie entered the store and pointed at the display. “I’d like to see that one, please.”
After a closer inspection, she was even more satisfied with her choice. She was just about to ask the clerk to ring it up for her when—
“I’ll take that bag.” A sharp voice rang out from behind her.
Sadie paused and turned to see who it was.
It was Hailey. Sadie recognized her from the photos she had previously seen.
Hailey was just walking into the store, her face twisted into a look of disdain.
She hadn’t expected to run into Sadie while shopping!
Sadie’s brows furrowed at the obvious hostility coming from the other woman. She had never interacted with Hailey before. Needless to say, this first impression was far from pleasant.
Even so, she was courteous.
“With all due respect, Ms. Burgess, I chose this bag first. It’s only fair that I take it, isn’t it?”
The rest on g?l?ν?
Hailey raised an eyebrow and crossed her arms over her chest.
“Fair?” she repeated, her tone more haughty now. “Ms. Hudson, you should know that here in Jazmah, there’s nothing that I can’t get.”
Sadie’s expression darkened. There seemed to be an underlying message in Hailey’s words.
“Ms. Burgess, I meant no offense,” Sadie remarked, not irritated but finding Hailey a bit too much. “Since you’re fond of this handbag as well, I’ll choose a different one,” she added, unwilling to make a spectacle over a purse.
She had come to purchase something for Isabel and wasn’t interested in conflict.
As she spoke, she moved to set the bag down.
“Hold on,” Hailey interjected sharply.
Her smirk was laced with mischief. “I’ll keep this bag, but I’m not a fan of sharing styles. Maybe you should browse somewhere else, Ms. Hudson.”noveldrama
Sadie’s brows furrowed. Was Hailey intentionally picking a fight?
She lifted her head, ready to respond.
“What’s all this about?” A teasing male voice sounded from the entrance.
Both women turned their heads.
Sutton strolled in, linked arm-in-arm with a striking young woman.
Sadie was slightly taken aback; today just seemed cursed.
With a smirk, Sutton observed them.
“Sadie, Ms. Burgess—what an unexpected run-in,” he said with mock cheer, his eyes darting between the two.
The lady beside him noticed the bag and clung to his arm, her expression brightening.
“Sutton, this bag is stunning,” she said sweetly, her tone alluring.
Sutton glanced down at her with indulgence.
“Do you like it?”
She nodded shyly.
“I’d love to have it. May I?” she asked, tugging his sleeve. Sutton chuckled, tilting her chin with a finger.
“Of course. It’s yours.”
He turned toward the clerk.

Message from Noah: Hope you enjoyed the chapters dear ones. God loves you and Noah whishes you all the best. ?( ? ? )

###Chapter 681:
“We’ll be taking this one.”
The atmosphere grew tense as the clerk hesitated, clearly uncomfortable.
Seeing this, Sutton raised an eyebrow. “Is there a problem?”
His voice carried the edge of impatience.
“N-no, sir. Just that both of these ladies were already considering it,” the clerk stammered.
Sutton’s grin widened, his tone laced with something deeper. “Oh? Seems this handbag is quite the prize.”
He looked directly at Hailey, as if making a point.
“I remember I dated someone who also liked bags of this style.”
Hailey’s face darkened immediately.
He was provoking her on purpose, and fury began to simmer.
“Sutton, cut it out,” she snapped, a warning in her voice.noveldrama
Sutton feigned ignorance, then turned to Sadie.
g?ν.0;  ?
“Sadie, in your opinion, who should have the bag?”
He deliberately tossed the question her way, and Sadie felt her patience evaporate.
She didn’t want any part of this absurdity.
She wanted to leave.
“Not interested anymore,” she said calmly, picking up her belongings and walking away.
After she left, Hailey glared daggers at Sutton.
“Have you lost your mind?” she hissed, turning on her heel.
But Sutton grabbed her wrist.
“Where do you think you’re going?”
Hailey struggled, but he wouldn’t loosen his grip.
“We need to talk.”
Sutton pushed the woman in his arms aside.
She stumbled and almost fell.
“Sutton!” she cried, her voice trembling with indignation. Sutton paid her no attention, dragging Hailey out of the shop.
“What’s gotten into you, Sutton?”
Hailey protested, wrestling against him, but his hold was unrelenting. He pulled her into a shadowy hallway and cornered her against the wall.
“You’ve been acting out lately, Hailey.” His tone was deep and threatening.
The sharpness of his voice caught Hailey off guard, and for a brief moment, she froze.
Her eyes lifted to his, conflicted emotions swirling within them.
“What is it you’re really after?” she questioned quietly.
At that moment, a flash of pain crossed Sutton’s expression.
“Must you always push me away like this?” he asked.
Hailey let out a bitter laugh and shoved him aside.
“Shouldn’t I? Don’t pretend you don’t know where we stand now,” she replied with scorn.
They had clearly grown apart.
Sutton stood frozen, words escaping him, though frustration burned in his gaze.
“Don’t forget the promise you made to me, Hailey,” he murmured.
She chuckled coldly, eyes filled with ridicule.
“Promise? I must have forgotten,” she replied with mock innocence.
.

.
###Chapter 682:
Her pretense made Sutton’s anger flare instantly.
“You bitch!” he snapped, raising a hand in fury.
But Hailey was faster—her slap rang sharply through the hallway.
He staggered back, stunned, one hand pressed to his cheek.
“You hit me?” he asked in disbelief.
Hailey smirked, her voice dripping with disdain.
“Why not? You need a reality check. I’m now the heiress of the Burgess Group, far beyond what I used to be. And you? On the verge of being cast out by the Walls, under the thumb of a woman. A failure like you has no power over me anymore.”
Her words were cutting, each one laced with contempt.
“Next time, I suggest you show proper manners around me.”
Without sparing Sutton another glance, she strode away, leaving him behind.
Sadie headed back to Wall Manor.
Isabel was waiting for her in the living room, and as soon as she saw Sadie, she waved her over.
 ? ? gν
“Come here, Sadie.” Isabel’s voice was noticeably softer than years ago.
“Isabel,” Sadie greeted with a nod as she sat next to her mother-in-law. Isabel let out a sigh and took her hand.
“I think it’s time for us to arrange for Noah’s burial. He’s been gone for some time now. We can’t keep putting this off.”
Sadie looked down and kept silent, her mind drifting off.
No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t shake the image of Patrick from her mind.
Noticing her dazed state, Isabel assumed that she was still grieving.
“I know it hurts,” she said, patting Sadie’s hand. “But we can’t bring him back, and we need to move forward with our lives. I spoke with the priest. The tenth of this month is an appropriate day for the burial. Let’s lay Noah to rest in the Wall family’s cemetery.”
That snapped Sadie back to her senses.
Noah’s burial?
The words cut like a knife through her heart.
She turned to Isabel, her expression heavy, and finally nodded.
“Let’s do that, then.”
Isabel let out another sigh, this time one of relief. There wasn’t much else to say after that.
The next morning,
The atmosphere in the Wall Group’s conference room was so tense it was suffocating. They were having a shareholders’ meeting, and it was far from a pleasant one.
Coyle was barely hiding his smirk. He was pleased with himself, and he wanted everyone to know it.
He was convinced that Sadie would meet her downfall today. There was no way she could turn things around at this point.
He glanced over at the empty seat at the head of the table, and his smirk widened. Sure enough, Sadie didn’t even show up.
She was scared, after all.
Feeling all smug and giddy, Coyle leaned back in his chair and basked in his triumph. He could already picture her begging for mercy, and he knew he was going to love every second of it.
Across the room, the other shareholders looked grim. Their brows were furrowed in concern as they brooded in silence.

###Chapter 683:
They had placed their hopes on Sadie to lead the Wall Group out of its crises.
Now, it seemed that they had badly misjudged her capabilities. She was faltering at such a crucial moment, making them feel like their support had all gone to waste.
Just then, the doors of the conference room swung open.
Sadie stepped inside, followed by Samuel and another, unfamiliar young man.
Everyone was caught off-guard.
This young man was tall and striking, but the most distinct thing about him was the mischievous smile he was sporting. He looked like the typical spoiled, rich kid.
“Who is he?” they wondered among themselves.
Sadie walked straight to her seat.
Her expression was calm and unperturbed, but as her gaze swept across the room, they noticed the telltale signs of exhaustion in her.
The past few days had truly been hard on her, but she couldn’t afford to waver now. She refused to show any weakness, not when there were so many people waiting for her. She casually plopped down.
The seat he had taken was to Sadie’s right—a position reserved exclusively for the Castro family. It had been vacant since Ralph’s retirement.
And now this young man just sauntered in and took it?
Discover updates g?lησνs?com
The whispers grew even more animated.
Coyle said nothing, but his expression darkened as he fixed his narrowed eyes on Blaine.
Who was this guy? What was Sadie up to?
Malcolm Pierce, one of the shareholders, was livid. He shot up to his feet and pointed a finger at Blaine.
“Who do you think you are? Who gave you the right to sit there?” He was so furious, even his white beard seemed to tremble when he spoke.
Not that it had any effect on Blaine. If anything, his smile turned even more devious, his eyes gleaming with amusement. He raised an eyebrow at Malcolm and replied, “My…”
“My name is Blaine Castro.” His tone was light and lazy, as if his name did not carry the weight that it did.
A pregnant silence fell over the room for a few seconds before it erupted into hushed remarks of confusion and disbelief.
They had heard of Blaine before, of course, but no one had ever seen him in person. All they knew was that he was Ralph’s only grandson, that he was raised abroad, had a carefree approach to life, and was notoriously unconventional in his ways.
Was the Castro family finally reclaiming their position among the ranks of the Wall Group? But how was that possible?
Coyle’s face twisted into an even uglier expression.
The Castro family’s sudden involvement was throwing a wrench in his plans. He couldn’t allow this to happen!
His upper lip curled into a sneer, and he scoffed loudly.
“What is this now, Sadie? Did you honestly think you could fool us by hiring an imposter? Frankly, I find that insulting.”
Some shareholders bobbed their heads in agreement.
After all, Ralph was a man of great stature. How could this frivolous young man possibly be his grandson?
The way they saw it, Sadie had brought in a fraud in a lame attempt to strengthen her fraying authority.
Sadie didn’t bat an eye at Coyle’s questioning. She had anticipated this reaction all along.
.

.
###Chapter 684:
She gave them a faint smile and spoke in a steady, firm tone.noveldrama
“If you have any doubts about his identity, you are more than welcome to visit Mr. Ralph Castro and ask him yourself. Regardless, Blaine shall represent the Castro family starting today. Feel free to direct any relevant concerns you may have to him.”
Her words left no room for argument.
For good measure, Samuel stepped forward and began distributing a set of documents down the table.
“Please take a look at the document. It’s an official authorization signed by Mr. Ralph Castro himself.”
The shareholders pored over the document and scrutinized it from every angle.
But no matter how hard they looked, the signature, the seal—everything was genuine.
It was Ralph’s signature on the document, right beside the stamped seal of the Castro family.
Another wave of whispers swept through the room. Everyone was shocked by this development.
That unruly-looking rascal was really Ralph’s grandson? Was the Castro family actually stepping back into the company affairs?
  : ν?
What was going on?
Coyle gnashed his teeth together. He had never seen this coming, and he couldn’t stomach the fact. It never occurred to him that Sadie would enlist the Castro family’s support. This was turning into a total disaster!
The Castro family had been one of Wall Group’s founding pillars. With their backing, Sadie’s position would practically be untouchable. Coyle’s fists clenched at his sides, his rage bubbling up to the surface.
“Is there a problem?” Blaine asked in obvious provocation. “Still think I’m an imposter?”
Blaine’s voice was relaxed, laced with the entitlement of someone born into privilege.
Instantly, Coyle’s complexion darkened even more.
Blaine was mocking him.
Fury surged in Coyle’s chest, but he lacked the courage to challenge the Castro name directly and was forced to suppress his rage.
Instead, he channeled his bitterness toward Sadie.
“Sadie, you…”
“Coyle,” Sadie cut in, her tone sharp and commanding, “In this company, you will refer to me as Ms. Hudson.”
Coyle was practically trembling with rage.
That shameless woman!
First Blaine, now Sadie—he’d been thoroughly embarrassed. His jaw tightened as he scrambled to reclaim authority.
“Ms. Hudson, there’s only one day left until the deadline you mentioned. And today happens to be the shareholders’ gathering. Surely you’re not about to read a resignation speech in this very room?” His voice was thick with mockery and challenge.
Sadie’s calm never wavered. Without a word, she glanced toward Samuel.
Catching her cue, Samuel placed a pile of papers on the polished conference table.
“Everyone,” he said firmly, “please review these documents. They detail the partnership Ms. Hudson secured with Mr. Noel from Burgess Group. The formal celebration will be held this Friday.”
Gasps filled the room as Samuel’s announcement landed. Coyle snatched the papers, eyes darting across the pages.

###Chapter 685:
The contract was airtight—the deal was complete.
How was this possible?
Sutton had promised Burgess Group would refuse Sadie’s offer.
What went wrong?
Sadie cleared her throat, her voice soft yet audible to everyone present.
“Everyone, the general manager seat has been vacant for a while. Mr. Ralph Castro and I have agreed that Blaine will assume the role.”
Shock rippled through the room.
All heads turned toward Blaine, who flashed a roguish grin and a playful wink.
The shareholders exchanged knowing looks, murmuring softly amongst themselves.
After all, Blaine was Ralph’s grandson, and having a Castro in charge as general manager felt inevitable.
Still, Blaine hardly fit the image of a competent leader.
Coyle’s hands balled into fists, his expression dark with fury.
g?ν.0;  novels
That scheming woman had crossed the line.
He had carefully orchestrated this meeting to oust Sadie and appoint Sutton to the general manager position.
Yet, Sadie had blindsided everyone by installing Blaine instead.noveldrama
His entire strategy was in shambles.
Frustration surged within Coyle, pushing him to the brink.
Meanwhile, Sadie, either unaware or indifferent to the storm brewing on his face, pressed on smoothly.
“Regarding the upcoming collaboration with the Burgess Group, Sutton, the logistics department manager, will be solely responsible.”
What? Was she offering Sutton a consolation prize to soften the blow? Rage simmered within Coyle, but he bit it back, knowing he needed to endure it for the sake of his son.
Satisfied with the outcome, Sadie rose from her seat and concluded sharply, “That will be all for today. Meeting adjourned.”
Without sparing another glance at the attendees, she exited confidently.
Blaine followed soon after, as carefree as ever.
The gathering dispersed abruptly, leaving Coyle frozen, pale with anger and disbelief.
He had spent months plotting, only to be effortlessly outmaneuvered by Sadie.
He seethed with resentment, unwilling to accept the bitter taste of failure, but helpless to reverse it. No—there was no way he’d let this slide. He would never surrender so easily.
Outside, as Sadie and Blaine walked in the hallway, Blaine shifted into a playful mood.
“You were brilliant in there, Sadie. You made Coyle’s face drain of all color.”
Sadie kept her focus, striding steadily toward the elevator.
“Your office is on the 17th floor,” she stated curtly. “I’ve assigned an assistant to you. She’s capable—dependable.”
Blaine wasn’t the least bit concerned about who the assistant might be. What intrigued him was Sadie herself—calm, cool, and efficient, just as she had been at the shareholders’ meeting, a stark contrast to his grandfather’s description of a delicate woman in need of protection.
Sadie was clearly a beautiful and formidable woman.
Raising a brow in amusement, Blaine watched her walk away. He flashed a wink at her retreating figure before heading downstairs.
.

###Chapter 686:
Sadie ignored his gesture entirely.
Once inside her office, she turned to Samuel and instructed, “Keep tabs on Sutton. Monitor him closely.”
A moment later, she added, “Also, arrange a meeting with Patrick.” Samuel, as always, asked no questions.
“Understood. I’ll handle it right away.”
Meanwhile, Blaine arrived at his new workspace on the 17th floor. The polished nameplate gleamed, and upon opening the door, he was greeted by an airy office with minimalist, tasteful decor.
Towering glass windows showcased a sweeping view of Jazmah’s skyline.
Clearly impressed, Blaine gave a low whistle.
“This is miles better than my setup overseas.”
Just then, a soft knock sounded.
“Come in,” he called, reclining casually in the chair.
Tina stepped inside, offering a professional smile.
?  : g?ν?
“Good afternoon, Mr. Castro. I’m Tina, your new assistant.”
Her voice was smooth and measured, but as her eyes met Blaine’s, she froze.
Sadie never revealed that the general manager was Blaine—she had merely mentioned assigning her as the assistant to the general manager!
Equally surprised, Blaine grinned broadly.
His mood brightened as he stood from his seat and strode over to her.
“Well, well,” he said, eyes twinkling. “Fancy meeting you here, gorgeous.”
Blaine flashed a wide grin, mischief dancing in his voice.
Tina, flustered beneath his unwavering gaze, instinctively stepped backward to put some space between them.
“Hello, Mr. Castro,” she mumbled, barely audible.
Blaine found her awkwardness utterly captivating.
Leaning forward with deliberate ease, he murmured teasingly, “Did anyone ever tell you how charming you look when you blush?”
Mortified, Tina wished the ground would swallow her whole. She shoved him away and, mustering her courage, shot him a warning glare.
“Mr. Castro, kindly show some decorum.”
Wasting no time, she shifted gears, adding swiftly, “Ms. Hudson asked me to remind you to first review the partnership between Wall Group and Burgess Group, then check in with Sutton.”
Blaine’s smirk faltered briefly.
Sutton? Coyle’s son?
His brow creased, irritation flashing across his features, but he held his tongue.
After a beat, he chuckled and replied nonchalantly, “Sure, I’ll follow Ms. Hudson’s instructions.”
Meanwhile, Coyle stormed into the logistics department manager’s office, his cane striking the floor with a loud crack.
The room was empty—Sutton was missing.
His fury surged as he slammed the cane against the desk with force.
The sudden noise prompted Sutton’s assistant to rush inside.
“M-Mr. Wall, how may I assist you?”noveldrama
Coyle’s breathing was heavy with rage.
“Where is Sutton? Where has he vanished to?”
.

###Chapter 687:
The assistant trembled, afraid to meet Coyle’s seething glare.
“I-I’ll contact him right away.”
Coyle’s eyes narrowed like blades.
Incompetent fool! He couldn’t even handle a simple task!
The assistant’s shaky fingers dialed Sutton’s number.
The line rang endlessly until a groggy, annoyed voice finally answered.
“Who’s this? What’s the reason for waking me? It’s too early,” Sutton grumbled, half-asleep.
The assistant broke into a cold sweat at Sutton’s sluggish tone.
“Mr. Wall, where are you? Your father demands your presence immediately.”
Silence lingered for a moment before Sutton sighed in irritation.
“My father is looking for me? Seriously? Doesn’t he know I’m busy?”
“He is furious. Please return at once,” the assistant pleaded desperately.
“Furious? What now?” Sutton snapped, still groggy.
R h  t glov?ls.
“It concerns the shareholders’ meeting,” the assistant explained hastily, ending the call before Sutton could say more. Anxiously, he turned back to Coyle.
“Mr. Sutton Wall was… sleeping. I told him to return immediately.”
Coyle’s expression darkened, his fury reaching a boiling point.
Sleeping? That pathetic son of his! They were about to lose the chance to take over the company, and this fool had the audacity to be sleeping? Worthless!
Rage made Coyle’s hand tremble as he clenched the cane. If Sutton stood before him now, he would’ve beaten him senseless.
Meanwhile, Sutton rubbed his aching head, the hangover clouding his thoughts.
As he shifted to lie back down, a realization struck him—shareholders’ meeting!
His eyes snapped open in horror. Today was the shareholders’ meeting!
“Shit!” he cursed under his breath.
Adrenaline surging, he sprang to his feet, scrambled into his car, and sped toward the office.
Bursting into his office, Sutton spotted his father sitting like a storm ready to erupt.
His stomach twisted in dread.
Lowering his gaze, he approached cautiously, not daring to meet his father’s eyes.
“Dad, I…”
Before Sutton could finish, a stack of papers flew at him, striking him squarely in the face and scattering across the floor.
Flustered, Sutton knelt to collect them.
Before he could even see what was written on them, his father’s furious voice thundered above him.
“On your knees, now!”
A cold shiver ran down Sutton’s spine. He swallowed hard, his legs giving way as he knelt.
Coyle loomed over him, gripping the cane tightly, anger in his eyes.
“Do you still remember what you promised me?” Coyle hissed, each word laced with venom. “That woman is walking all over us!”
Sutton’s eyes darted to the papers.
It was the partnership agreement between Wall Group and Burgess Group.
Hailey had once vowed never to collaborate with Sadie, yet she had broken that promise.

###Chapter 688:
A wave of cold dread washed over him, draining the color from his face.
Sutton jerked his head upward, fury blazing in his gaze.
“Dad, Hailey deceived me!” he rasped, jaw clenched tightly, barely restraining the urge to tear Hailey apart.
Coyle observed Sutton’s devastated demeanor, and though irritation remained, his anger eased somewhat.noveldrama
There was no sense in lecturing him now—damage control was the priority.
“Alright, get up,” Coyle ordered, his voice still laced with disapproval despite the more tempered tone.
“Luckily, Sadie passed the Burgess Group project to our department. Blaine showed up out of nowhere.”
Coyle’s mood soured as soon as he mentioned the name. His frown deepened, and bitterness seeped into his voice.
“But that spoiled young man lacks any real competence.”
Contempt practically dripped from Coyle’s words, leaving no doubt how little regard he had for Blaine.
“This time, don’t get careless,” he warned, his voice sharp as a blade. “If you ruin things again, there will be consequences.”

Sutton had just risen to his feet, his entire frame shaking as he gave a rapid nod.
“Dad, trust me. This time, I won’t fail you!”
Coyle scoffed sharply, relying on his cane as he stormed out of the room.
Sutton’s eyes fixated on the partnership agreement in his grasp.
Hailey! That wretched woman! He would make sure she paid!
He seized his phone and hastily punched in a number.
“Mr. Wall?” came a deferential voice.
“Make sure Hailey understands what she’s up against,” Sutton instructed grimly.
Hailey was completely unaware that Sutton was planning to retaliate against her. Her attention was on Noah, who seemed ready to leave.
“Noah, where are you headed?” she inquired with a hint of false concern.
Noah calmly reached for his jacket and replied, “I’m going to meet Sadie.”
A shadow crossed Hailey’s expression at the mention of Sadie’s name, but she quickly masked it with a soft smile.
“Mind if I join you?” she asked carefully, her tone laced with hope.
Noah hesitated briefly, eyeing her as though weighing his options.
Hailey’s pulse quickened.
She wanted to see if Noah’s attitude toward Sadie had softened. To protect her own interests, she needed to know whether Noah’s loyalty remained with her. After a pause, he gave a small nod.
“Alright, let’s go together.”
Relief and excitement surged through Hailey as she beamed.
“Thank you, Noah,” she replied sweetly, linking her arm with his. Soon, they arrived at George’s Restaurant, greeted by its refined atmosphere and mellow tunes.
A waiter promptly approached and led them to their table.
Hailey glanced around, but Sadie was nowhere in sight.
Strange… Was Sadie running late?
Noah settled into his chair with quiet confidence, exuding poise.
Hailey mirrored him, though an uneasy feeling tugged at her.
Something was definitely off.
“Noah, I need to use the restroom,” she said suddenly.
.

.
###Chapter 689:
He gave a slight nod.
“Sure.”
Hailey rose and headed toward the ladies’ room, which was outside the restaurant.
At that moment, Sadie emerged from one of the stalls, neither aware of the other’s presence—or of the eyes lurking nearby.
The men watching mistook Sadie for Hailey, given her matching silhouette and features from the photo.
Without delay, the group sprang into action.
The leader of the goons lunged forward, swiftly clamping a hand over Sadie’s mouth.
Her eyes widened in terror as she tried to process the sudden attack.
A pungent chemical scent suddenly flooded her senses.
Oh no! Panic flared—she knew she was in trouble.
Sadie fought to scream, but the grip was too strong, and no sound escaped.
R  ov.o
Within seconds, the drug took hold.
The world spun, her vision darkened, and strength drained from her body.
She wanted to resist but had no strength left.
Helpless, she was dragged away.
Meanwhile, Samuel had been waiting outside the restroom, anxiously glancing at his watch.
Sadie had yet to reappear, and his unease steadily deepened. His steps grew restless as he paced.
By all accounts, she shouldn’t have been inside for this long. Had something gone wrong?
Torn between concern and propriety, he wanted to check inside but hesitated—it was the women’s restroom, after all.
While caught in indecision, a woman exited the restroom.
Samuel swiftly approached her with polite urgency.noveldrama
“Pardon me,” he began respectfully, “did you happen to notice a striking young lady inside?”
The woman blinked, momentarily confused.
“A young lady?” she echoed. “No, there is no one in there now.”
Samuel’s stomach dropped.
“Are you certain?” he pressed, his voice tighter. “No one at all?”
She nodded, brows furrowed.
“Positive. I was the only one.”
Alarm flashed across his face, and his worry spiked.
There was no one in the restroom, and Sadie wasn’t outside either.
Something was off.
Wasting no time, he pulled out his phone and dialed her number.
The ringtone stretched on endlessly—no response.
The repetitive beeping grated on his nerves.
His heart dropped.
Sadie would never ignore a call without reason.
Unless… something had happened to her.
That was when he spotted several tall men in black suits stationed near the restaurant entrance, their demeanor sharp and vigilant. Samuel instantly recognized them. They were Burgess Group’s security detail, often seen accompanying Hailey.

###Chapter 690:
An idea struck him.
He had treated this meal as a routine engagement, opting not to bring protection along.
Now, his only option was to seek help from the Burgess Group.
He quickly made his way inside the restaurant and looked around, spotting Noah seated by the window, calmly enjoying his coffee.
Without hesitation, Samuel rushed over.
“Mr. Noel,” he said urgently, “Ms. Hudson is missing. Could you assist me in locating her?”
Noah froze mid-gesture, his fingers clamped around the coffee mug.
What was that supposed to mean?
His eyes lifted, sharp and searching.
Under the weight of Noah’s unwavering gaze, Samuel felt a ripple of discomfort but forced himself to recount the situation briskly and clearly.
Noah’s brow knitted tightly as uneasiness surged within him. He carefully placed the mug down and sprang upright, knocking his chair aside in his urgency.

The crash of the chair hitting the floor shattered the restaurant’s stillness, prompting nearby patrons to glance over curiously.
But Noah paid them no mind.
His expression hardened, his tone cold and commanding as he instructed his bodyguards, “Find her now! Shut down the mall and review the security cameras!”
The guards instantly sprang into action, the restaurant’s air thickening with tension.
Noah remained motionless, his demeanor shifting between emotions. Why did he feel so unsettled? Sadie was just a business partner. Her vanishing had no bearing on him.
Yet the moment he learned of her disappearance, dread gripped him, as though something precious was slipping away.
The feeling rattled him.
Noah couldn’t process it—nor did he want to.
Without delay, he exited the restaurant alongside Samuel, leaving behind the vacant table.
When Hailey returned, she paused, puzzled.
Where was Noah? Why had he left so abruptly?
She slid into her seat, prompting a waitress to approach, her voice polite.
“Ma’am, can I help you?”
Hailey steadied herself and asked with calm curiosity, “The gentleman who was here earlier—where is he?”
“The gentleman? Are you referring to Mr. Noel?” the waitress replied with mild confusion. “Mr. Noel seemed to have an urgent issue and departed suddenly.”
An urgent issue? What could have driven Noah to leave without notice? Hailey’s confusion deepened. She needed answers.
Without wasting another moment, she stood and hurried out of the establishment.noveldrama
Elsewhere, inside an apartment building, Sadie’s captors ushered Sutton into an apartment.
“Mr. Wall,” the thug leader said with an oily smile. “We delivered her just as you asked. Everything’s been handled, and the drugs are working. You’re in for a great time.”
Sutton’s lips curled into a satisfied grin.
“Nicely done. Here—your payment.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 691:
He flung a thick stack of bills toward the thug leader, indifferent. The thug leader’s eyes sparkled at the sight of the cash, his grin stretching wider.
“It’s a pleasure to work for you, Mr. Wall. We’re always happy to assist.” With a wave of his hand, Sutton dismissed the thugs.
“Get lost.”
“Yes, of course. Enjoy yourself,” the thug leader said, bowing before retreating with the others, quietly closing the door behind them.
Sutton adjusted his collar, a dark smirk playing on his lips.
“Hailey… let’s see how long you can keep up that pure facade,” he mused.
Anticipation buzzed in his veins as he stepped into the dimly lit room. Shadows stretched along the walls, and a slender figure lay still on the mattress.
Sutton rubbed his palms together, eagerness radiating from him. With feverish impatience, he stripped off his clothes, his laughter low and salacious.
“Come on, sweetheart, drop the act. I know you’ve been waiting for this. Don’t think I’ve forgotten how wild you once were. Today, I’ll make sure you have the time of your life.”
He lunged toward the bed, but just as he did, the person stirred. Sadie felt feverish, her mind clouded and her senses blurred.
She shifted, tugging at her collar in a bid to cool down.noveldrama
gα?ησν?s?com makes every story special
That slight movement made Sutton freeze in place.
His muscles tightened as he finally saw the woman’s face in the faint glow.
It wasn’t Hailey. It was Sadie!
Shock slammed into him, snuffing out any previous desire.
He recoiled, stumbling away from the bed, terror flooding his veins. How was this possible? How did Sadie end up here? He had clearly instructed the thugs to bring Hailey! Sutton’s mind reeled in frantic confusion.
As he glanced down at his disheveled clothes, disgust rolled through him.
He had almost laid hands on Sadie—mistaking her for Hailey.
The thought alone made him sick.
Without delay, he yanked his pants back on, fumbling as panic overtook him.
His only goal now was to get the hell out of there.
Outside, the thugs lounged, grinning smugly.
When Sutton emerged so quickly, they exchanged knowing looks, assuming he’d already indulged. Their faces lit up with excitement.
“Mr. Wall, done already? Want some company? We promise you’ll enjoy it even more,” the leader joked.
Sutton’s fury exploded at his words.
His eyes blazed as he slammed a vicious kick into the leader’s gut.
“Shut up, you idiot!”
The thug doubled over, stunned.
“Mr. Wall, what’s wrong?”
Sutton, breathing heavily, pointed furiously toward the room. “I said to snatch Hailey! Open your damn eyes and look who you delivered!”
Confusion swept over the group.
Hadn’t they grabbed Hailey? The woman’s figure matched, and they’d cross-checked with the photo. How could there have been a mix-up?
The men exchanged uneasy glances, utterly rattled.
Sutton was livid, his entire body shaking with anger.
“You’re worthless! A bunch of goddamn idiots! You can’t even handle a simple task! What on earth am I even paying you for?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 692:
The leader of the thugs was berated so harshly that he barely dared to breathe.
After a while, he cautiously asked, “Who is inside, Mr. Wall?”
“It’s that wretched woman, Sadie!” Sutton practically spat, his voice filled with venom. The thugs were stunned by his answer. Sadie? The chairwoman of Wall Group? How could it be her?
Sutton was still fuming over the blunder when a thought suddenly crossed his mind. He rushed forward and grabbed the leader by the collar.
“Did anyone see you take Sadie?” he demanded.
That was his biggest concern. If word got out that he had targeted his own cousin-in-law, the scandal would be enormous. His father wouldn’t let him off the hook either.
“No, no, absolutely not! Rest assured, Mr. Wall—we were extremely careful. No one saw anything,” the thug leader stammered, his face draining of color as he frantically shook his head.
Afraid that Sutton might not believe him, he quickly added, “We know how to keep our mouths shut. You can trust us. Not a word of this will ever get out.”
Sutton finally relaxed, though only slightly.
As long as no one else knew about it, it didn’t matter what he did to Sadie.
His eyes flickered with dark malice.
Since Sadie was already here, wouldn’t it be a waste not to take full advantage of her vulnerable state?
She had always acted cold and arrogant toward him, as if he could never touch her, as if nothing he did could ever gain her attention.
Well, tonight, he was going to make sure that Sadie’s tough act would crumble beyond recovery.
He swept a glance over the goons, who still appeared clueless about the situation.
“She’s all yours,” Sutton said, his tone chilling. “Consider it a little reward from me. Make sure she has a good time with you boys.”
The men froze, staring at him in shock.
Was this for real?
They exchanged glances, unable to believe their luck.
“Mr. Wall,” the thug leader asked, his voice tinged with hesitation. “Are you really leaving her to us?”
Sutton clicked his tongue and shot him an impatient glare. “Why the hell would I waste my time lying to you? But let me be clear about one thing—if even a breath of tonight’s events gets out, you bastards will have hell to pay!”
It was a blatant threat, and the thugs knew he was capable of following through.noveldrama
They nodded earnestly, swearing themselves to silence.
Going against the Wall family was simply out of the question. Besides, spending time with such a stunning woman was a rare opportunity.
Satisfied, Sutton took one last glance at the closed door of the bedroom before walking away with a sneer.
It was about time Sadie learned what happened to those who made the mistake of crossing him.
As soon as the door shut behind Sutton, the thugs began tittering with excitement.
They had spent years toeing the line, doing all kinds of dirty work, and now this was proving to be a glorious windfall. More than that, a gorgeous woman was theirs for the taking. It felt like a gift from the heavens.
“Boss, what do we do?” one of the lackeys asked, already rubbing his palms together in eager anticipation.
The thug leader smirked, his face mirroring the excitement of his men. “What do you think?” he asked with a dark chuckle. “Have you seen the beauty in there? We’d be fools to pass up this chance. Tonight, we shall enjoy to our hearts’ content!”
.

###Chapter 693:
“However—” he quickly followed up before his men could erupt in cheers. He looked at each of them one by one. “Not a damn word of this leaves this apartment. If I catch anyone running his mouth, I’ll make sure he regrets it for the rest of his life.”
His subordinates shuddered and swore silence on the matter. With that out of the way, the leader smacked his lips and stepped toward the door.
“After you, boss!” a thug exclaimed, clearly trying to curry favor. The leader turned to flash the men a wide grin, then bodily pushed the door open.
A faint trace of incense lingered in the air inside the room.
Even in the dim light, they could see Sadie clearly as she lay on the bed, her delicate face tinged with a soft flush. She looked more alluring than ever, more desirable.
The thug leader immediately felt a rush of heat course through his body, and his breathing grew labored.
What a stunning beauty, indeed! Sutton must have been out of his mind to give her away without a second thought.
The leader ran his tongue over his lower lip. He couldn’t wait to indulge himself.
But something was missing—the mood wasn’t quite right.
? ? ?: ν．
He thought about it for a moment, then his eyes flashed when an idea came to him.
He whipped around to his men and ordered, “Bring me my aphrodisiac incense. We’re going to make this a very memorable night.”
They all understood his intentions, and their faces broke out in similar, wicked grins.
It didn’t take long for one of them to bring a tray of incense.
The thug leader lit one stick, and an odd scent instantly filled the room.noveldrama
This particular incense was known to heighten sexual desire and intensify the overall experience in the bedroom.
The man closed his eyes and took a deep breath, feeling the heat surge within him.
He let out a wicked laugh and strode toward the bed.
“Well, well, well. It’s time to give our little beauty some special attention,” the thug leader murmured, his hand already reaching out to Sadie.
Just then, a soft chime echoed through the hallway as the elevator doors opened.
The thugs loitering nearby instinctively turned, assuming Sutton had returned. However, when their eyes landed on the occupants inside, their bodies stiffened.
Inside the elevator stood a group of men, with a towering figure leading them.
Even with most of his face hidden behind a silver mask, his presence exuded an intimidating authority that demanded immediate attention.
His sharp gaze alone sent a cold shiver through their bones.
It was Patrick, CEO of Burgess Group.
Behind him stood Samuel and a squad of grim-faced guards clad in dark attire.
A suffocating tension filled the hallway, draining the color from the thugs’ faces.
None of them had anticipated Patrick’s appearance here—and from the aura he carried, it was clear he wasn’t here for idle talk.
A crushing dread weighed heavily on their chests.
“Deal with them,” Noah commanded, his tone steely and absolute, leaving no room for hesitation.
Samuel’s spine straightened as he snapped, “Understood!”
Without missing a beat, the guards surged forward, surrounding the thugs in a swift and coordinated strike.
In a panic, the thugs collapsed to their knees, frantically begging, “Mr. Noel, please! We were only obeying orders! Spare us!”

###Chapter 694:
Noah remained unmoved, his icy stare directed at the door ahead. With a swift motion, he kicked it open, the crash reverberating through the room.
A thick, suffocating odor assaulted his senses as the door swung inward. His expression darkened.
Beneath the dim glow, Noah spotted a burly man sprawled across the bed, pawing at the woman beneath him.
The frail figure beneath the brute trembled, her clothing in disarray—it was Sadie.
A surge of white-hot rage coursed through Noah, veins bulging at his temples.
Fury consumed him.
Without a moment’s pause, he strode over, yanked the thug up by the collar, and hurled him across the room like a ragdoll.
The man slammed against the floor, letting out a guttural scream.
Noah’s glare grew colder as he turned back to the bed.
Sadie lay unconscious, her cheeks burning with redness, her breaths shallow and labored.
Torn fabric exposed streaks of her skin, flushed with an unsettling redness.
ore capters @ g?ν?
His chest tightened painfully at the sight.
Noah shrugged off his jacket and tenderly laid it over Sadie, shielding her from the cold air.
The thug on the floor scrambled upright, terror etched into his face.
Before he could make a move, Noah’s piercing gaze locked onto him, freezing him in place. His breath hitched, his entire body going rigid with fear.
Moments later, Samuel entered, absorbing the grim scene in a heartbeat. Wordlessly, he grabbed the thug and dragged him from the room.
In his frantic struggle, the thug accidentally slammed the bedroom door shut.
Noah bent down, carefully lifting Sadie into his arms.
Her feverish body pressed against him, her faint fragrance clinging to him like a spell.
He instinctively tightened his grip, feeling a rush of emotion at the familiar warmth.
As he gazed down at her, he couldn’t help but notice her ethereal beauty—the flawless lines of her face, her porcelain skin glowing faintly in the soft light. Her parted lips trembled, a quiet whimper escaping as her fevered state deepened.
That fragile image unlocked a vague memory buried deep within him, and Noah’s heart skipped a beat.
Just as he prepared to leave, Sadie stirred, heat coursing through her as she writhed weakly in his arms.
Her lashes fluttered open, revealing eyes clouded by fever. The first thing she saw was the silver mask—and the dark, familiar eyes behind it. Something in them tugged at her, both foreign and familiar.
She wanted to see the face hidden beneath, but before she could think, her body instinctively curled closer to the warmth holding her. A soft murmur escaped her lips. “Noah…”
Noah tensed.
Had she just spoken his name?
At the Glory Jewelry Exhibition, he thought it had been a hallucination.
But this time, the sound was clear, undeniable.noveldrama
Did she somehow know his true identity?
His pulse quickened, emotions in turmoil.
Clinging to his collar, Sadie pressed herself against him, her voice small and fragile. “Noah… feel awful…”
The desperation in her tone sent a tremor through Noah.
.
.
.
###Chapter 695:
The heavy, perfumed air clung to them, laced with suggestive tension. Even Noah could sense something amiss.
A slow, insidious heat stirred within him, creeping through his limbs and pooling in his core.
Sadie’s restless movements made matters worse, pushing him to the brink.
His breathing deepened, tension coiling in every muscle.
In her haze, Sadie’s fingertips brushed against the chilled surface of his mask, jolting her slightly.
Her hand instinctively trailed along its edges before lifting it free, revealing the face hidden beneath.
The face that had haunted Sadie’s thoughts day and night suddenly materialized before her.
She froze in place, her gaze unfocused as she stared at Noah.
It was indeed him—Noah. Her Noah was back!
Tears welled up in Sadie’s eyes as the longing she’d pent up overflowed.
In a sudden move, she lifted her head, her eyes rimmed with red, and kissed Noah. Her lips met his with a fervent warmth.
Noah shuddered under her touch.
His mind blanked out, every rational thought eclipsed by the intensity of the moment.noveldrama
His soul seemed to tremble. This sensation was both familiar and strange, yet irresistibly captivating.
Desire overtook Noah’s reason, overwhelming his restraint.
He cradled Sadie’s head as he deepened their kiss.
Her response was a blend of raw passion and clumsiness, filled with deep longing and attachment.
She clung to him, seeking solace in his warmth and the comforting scent of him.
“Noah…” she whispered, her voice laden with emotion, “I need you…” At that, Noah’s last vestiges of control vanished.
“Sadie…”
They embraced fiercely, their bodies entwining as they fell onto the soft bed.
The room’s temperature seemed to spike.
Meanwhile, outside, Samuel returned to the hallway after finishing his tasks.
Several bodyguards stood guard by the door.
As he approached, strange noises emanated from the room.
His heart raced.
The sounds grew louder, unmistakably the deep, low tones of a man intertwined with a woman’s soft moans.
The man’s voice… it sounded uncannily like Mr. Noel’s.
Shock painted Samuel’s face.
What could Mr. Noel and Ms. Hudson possibly be doing?
He glanced back at the bodyguards, his expression betraying his astonishment.
The bodyguards exchanged uneasy glances, their faces tense, as if they, too, had heard the sounds but were unsure how to react.
Samuel paused, deciding it was best to withdraw.
The complexities of what was happening inside the room were beyond their ability to intervene.
Moreover, Samuel sensed something different about Mr. Noel today. From the moment he learned of Ms. Hudson’s disappearance at the restaurant, his demeanor had been unusually tense and agitated.
.
.
.
###Chapter 696:
All his reactions since then felt strangely familiar to Samuel.
A troubling thought flashed through his mind.
Why did Mr. Noel’s voice so closely resemble Mr. Wall’s?
Samuel’s pulse quickened.
He pushed the thought aside.
With a composed gesture, he signaled the bodyguards.
“Let’s step back for now. No one approaches this area without my say.”
The bodyguards nodded in unison. “Yes, sir.” Silently, Samuel led them away.
Meanwhile, Hailey had returned alone to the suburban villa.
The villa was ablaze with lights yet felt unsettlingly vacant.
She pulled out her phone.
Still no answer from Noah.
Hailey’s brow furrowed, a surge of worry washing over her.
Nore chatpers ν.c0n 
What was happening? Why wasn’t he answering? Could he possibly be with Sadie?
The thought struck Hailey forcefully.
No, that couldn’t be right!
Noah loathed that woman.
Perhaps he was simply too busy to notice his phone.
That had to be the explanation.
Despite her attempts to reassure herself, a nagging unease persisted. She set down her phone and began pacing the living room, lost in thought.
As morning arrived, sunlight crept through the blinds, gently illuminating Sadie’s face.
She blinked open her eyes to an unfamiliar ceiling above her. Her body felt as though it had been disassembled and pieced back together.
Sadie frowned, slowly propping herself up into a sitting position.
The air still held a faint, lingering fragrance.
Memories of the previous night—familiar yet elusive sensations—gradually filled her mind.
Suddenly, Sadie froze.
She recalled being drugged, her consciousness becoming foggy, then everything turning fragmented.
She remembered seeing Noah.
Yes, Noah!
Her heart raced as she hastily threw off the covers.
The white sheets bore vivid, unmistakable traces of last night’s fervor. Instinctively, Sadie scanned the room for Noah.noveldrama
She checked the bed, the bathroom, the walk-in closet—no sign of anyone.
Her heart sank.
As she walked to the bedside, her eyes inadvertently swept across the floor.
A silver mask lay there.
It was identical to the one Patrick always wore.
Could it be… the man last night wasn’t Noah, but Patrick?
Yet, that blurred face—she couldn’t have been mistaken.
Sadie clutched the mask tightly, her heart heavy with confusion and dread.
Just then, a knock at the door broke her contemplation.
“Ms. Hudson, are you awake?” Samuel’s voice came through. She took a moment to steady her nerves.
.
.
.
###Chapter 697:
“Come in,” she called.
Samuel entered, carrying a neatly folded set of women’s clothes.
“Ms. Hudson, these clothes have been prepared for you.”
Sadie accepted the clothes and retreated to the bathroom.
After changing, she emerged, trying to maintain her usual composure.
“About last night…”
Samuel hovered on the edge of his words, visibly torn. Sadie’s eyes narrowed, her voice low and unwavering. “Say it. The truth, Samuel.” Only then did he muster the nerve.
“The men from last night… they talked. It was Sutton behind it. He planned to kidnap Hailey. But they took the wrong person.” Sadie’s expression hardened—like a surface kissed by sudden frost.
Sutton. Again.
Relentless, venomous Sutton.
Samuel shifted uncomfortably, his voice softer now. “Also… Ms. Hudson, I saw Patrick’s car pulling away just as I got here.”

Silence slammed down between them.
It wasn’t Noah last night. It was Patrick.
She should have known better. Should’ve kept her walls high, her heart distant, especially when her husband’s death still hung fresh in the air.noveldrama
How could she…
Sadie’s guilt deepened. She felt awful.
Even after she returned to the office, her thoughts remained a chaotic tangle.
“Earth to Sadie,” came a voice—smooth, amused, and far too close.
Sadie jolted, reality snapping back like a rubber band. Blaine stood beside her, wearing that trademark smirk, his eyes scanning her face like he was reading a page.
“What’s got you so flustered this early? What happened?” He lifted a brow, playfully skeptical.
Sadie shot him a look. “Mind your own business.”
She steadied herself with a breath and forced a shift in tone. “Anyway, what are you doing here?”
A quick subject change—anything to avoid being bothered by Blaine.
He offered a shrug, palms up.
“The Burgess Group called a meeting to move forward on the partnership.” He paused, letting irritation slip into his voice. “Sutton’s missing—no calls, no texts, nowhere to be seen. And Patrick? He suddenly bailed last minute.”
The mention of Patrick made Sadie flinch. Subtle, but there.
She avoided Blaine’s gaze, her words clipped. “If Mr. Noel’s not showing up, you’ll have to handle it solo.”
With that, she spun on her heel and vanished into her office, the door shutting behind her with a sharp finality.
Blaine stared after her, brow furrowed, a little stunned.
What was wrong with Sadie today?
She seemed distant. Tense. Like a wire pulled taut and ready to snap.
Behind the office door, Sadie sat motionless—at least on the outside. She snatched up the internal line. “Samuel,” she said, her voice as cold as cut glass. “Those thugs from last night—deal with them. And as for Sutton… he’s no longer worth keeping alive in this game.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 698:
That bastard actually dared to harm her.
A beat of hesitation crackled over the line. “Ms. Hudson… those men were already taken by Mr. Noel’s people last night. And Sutton… well, he’s vanished.”
Sadie’s lips parted slightly in shock.
She slowly set the phone down, her fingers tightening around the sleek mask in her hand. She turned it over and over, unable to still the storm churning inside her.noveldrama
In an abandoned factory in the suburbs, the thugs from the night before hung by their wrists, suspended like grotesque marionettes, their cries echoing through the rusting beams.
Just outside, a matte-black Maybach idled. From within, Noah watched—silent, detached, cold.
A man in black approached the car, his steps crisp and precise.
“Mr. Noel,” he said, bowing slightly. “Sutton’s inside.”
Noah stepped out, his movements deliberate. He took the wooden bat handed to him—no words exchanged.
? ?: ?ν?
The factory was dark and wet, the stench of alcohol and rust in the air.
Sutton lay slumped in a chair, hands bound. Drunk and unaware.
Noah didn’t hesitate. He lifted the bat.
Crack!
The sound was brutal, final.
Sutton stirred, eyes fluttering open, fogged with alcohol and confusion. Shapes swam in his vision until one figure came into sharp focus—tall, composed, and terrifyingly familiar.
Noah stood over him, no mask, no disguise. Just cold, unforgiving clarity.
Sutton’s breath caught in his throat. He didn’t even scream. He couldn’t. Terror strangled the sound before it could leave his lungs.
But… Noah was supposed to be dead.
Then who—what—was this?
Sutton’s eyes widened, the blood draining from his face. A cold sweat slicked his skin as reality began to twist around him.
Noah’s gaze shifted toward the bodyguard silently waiting beside him. His voice was ice wrapped in velvet. “Since Mr. Wall enjoys women so much… then let him enjoy himself to the fullest.”
“Understood, Mr. Noel.”
The title hit Sutton like a hammer. Mr. Noel?
Patrick was Noah?
No. No, that couldn’t be.
His head thrashed in disbelief, panic setting in like wildfire.
But Noah was already turning away, indifferent.
He didn’t even look back.
Behind him, the bodyguards stepped forward, blades drawn.
And then came the screams—raw, frenzied, helpless.
Noah slid into the back seat of the Maybach, closing the door quietly. “Mr. Noel, where to now?” the driver asked respectfully. “Ms. Burgess has been waiting for you, having called several times.”
Noah’s brow furrowed faintly.

###Chapter 699:
Almost instinctively, he murmured, “Myrtlewood Estate.”
The words slipped out before he could stop them. A beat of silence followed.
The driver blinked, confused.
“I’m sorry, sir… there’s no Myrtlewood Estate in Jazmah.”
Noah caught himself. He exhaled slowly, pressing two fingers to his temple. “Take me to the suburban villa,” he said at last, his voice low, laced with fatigue.
The driver didn’t say anything else. The engine hummed to life, and the car rolled forward.
Noah leaned back, eyes closing, though his mind refused to quiet.
Last night haunted him like smoke—clinging to everything.
Sadie.
Just her name was enough to stir something volatile in him.
He should’ve hated her. And yet… his thoughts pulled toward her like a tide he couldn’t resist. He hated that he missed her presence. Noah’s eyes snapped open, frustration simmering just beneath the surface.noveldrama
? ?  : ν?
He didn’t want to face it. But the truth clawed its way up anyway. What he felt for Sadie wasn’t just disdain. There was something else—something far more dangerous.
Desire.
The realization made his chest tighten with unease.
He squeezed his eyes shut, as if darkness could drive her out of his head.
But her image remained—etched into the backs of his eyelids.
Her curves, her breath, the way her body had arched beneath him…
The memory flared like a match strike in the dark.
Noah exhaled sharply, forcing himself to regain control.
It was nothing, he told himself. Just the drug. Just confusion.
Nothing had happened. And nothing ever would.
There would be no future between him and Sadie.
The villa in the suburbs was brightly lit.
Hailey had stayed up all night, anxiously waiting for Noah’s return. The moment she heard the door open, her face broke into a joyful smile, and she practically scrambled to her feet to greet him.
“Noah, you’re finally home! I was so worried about you,” Hailey pouted, her tone aggrieved.
Noah was visibly taken aback by her behavior. He paused and studied the woman before him. The delicate makeup she had on and the gentle smile she gave did evoke a memory of the past.
Deep down, however, he felt no romantic feelings toward Hailey. If anything, there was a keen sense of aversion, bordering on repulsion. He instinctively stepped to the side to put some distance between them.
“Some issues came up at the company,” Noah said flatly. “I had to stay and take care of them.”
Hailey’s smile faltered. She could sense Noah’s sudden coldness toward her, and it only fed into her growing unease. Just where had he been last night? Who had he been with?
Hailey forced herself to continue smiling.
“I’m glad you’re okay. I was worried something happened to you. Why don’t I make you something to eat?” she offered, already turning toward the kitchen.

###Chapter 700:
But Noah’s words stopped her. “There’s no need. I’m tired, so I’ll head upstairs to rest.”
Hailey paused mid-step. She pressed her lips into a thin line to keep herself from asking more questions. She managed a small nod.
“Right, you should rest. No matter how busy work gets, you need to take care of yourself.”
Noah hummed in acknowledgment before heading up the stairs. Not once did he glance back at her.
Hailey’s smile finally dropped when he disappeared into the second-floor landing.
Something was wrong here, very, very wrong.
Noah had acted aloof since he walked into the villa—a sharp contrast to how he usually treated her.noveldrama
Hailey felt her heart sink.
She turned her attention outside, where Noah’s car was still parked. The driver stood by the vehicle, his stance measured and respectful.
  ? @ g?ν?.c?
Hailey headed outside to talk to him. “Do you know where Noah went last night?” She tried to keep her tone steady, not wanting to seem too anxious.
The driver hesitated, clearly surprised by the young lady’s question. He wasn’t quite sure how to respond.
His apprehension didn’t escape Hailey’s notice. She softened her tone. “It’s all right. Just tell me the truth. I won’t hold it against you.” The driver took a few more seconds to make up his mind. When he did speak, he sounded nervous. “Well, Ms. Burgess, Mr. Noel went to deal with matters regarding Mr. Sutton Wall.”
He glanced at Hailey warily, afraid that he had said something wrong.
Sutton? Hailey’s heart skipped a beat. A voice in the back of her head told her that the matters in question might have something to do with her.
“What happened with Sutton? Tell me everything you know.” Feeling pressured now, the driver recounted the events of the previous night, including how Sutton had hired thugs to abduct Hailey, only for them to kidnap Sadie by mistake. He then went on to explain how Noah had arrived at the scene just in time to stop the men from doing anything to Sadie.
Hailey’s eyes widened with shock and horror as she listened. A lot had happened last night, and she didn’t even have any idea.
So, Sutton had tried to harm her? That fool!
A strange mix of fear and relief washed over her. On one hand, it was a good thing that Noah had dealt with Sutton, sparing her from future trouble with her previous paramour. On the other, Noah had ultimately done it all to save Sadie.
So, what else happened? What did they do after Noah rescued Sadie?
Hailey felt a ball of dread in the pit of her stomach.
Struggling to keep her emotions in check, she pried further. “Do you know what Noah and Sadie did afterward?”
The driver looked even more flustered by the question. He shook his head vigorously. “I don’t know anything else, Ms. Burgess. My duty is to drive Mr. Noel to his destination, that’s all. I would never dare to ask him about his private affairs.”
Needless to say, this reaction only fueled Hailey’s suspicions. The more the driver denied any knowledge, the more it seemed to her that he had something to hide.

###Chapter 701:
All at once, she was overcome with a sense of urgency. Gritting her teeth behind her stiff smile, she retrieved a stack of cash from her purse and handed it to the driver. “Thank you for today. Take this and treat yourself to a drink.”
The driver drew back in surprise and waved his hands to refuse the money. “I can’t accept this, Ms. Burgess. I was only doing my job.”noveldrama
But Hailey insisted, going so far as to press the cash into his hands. “Take it. You deserve it. If anything comes up in the future, let me know, all right?”
Her voice was gentle and kind, with only the faintest hint of intention. It was enough for the driver to understand her meaning, though. He nodded gratefully. “Thank you, Ms. Burgess. I’ll be sure to keep you informed.”
Hailey offered a satisfied smile. “Go on, get some rest.” She gave a small wave, casually dismissing the driver.
Relieved, he didn’t hesitate—slipping behind the wheel and pulling away from the villa, tires crunching softly against the gravel.
Hailey stood still, her eyes following the car until it vanished into the horizon. The moment it was gone, her smile fell, like a mask dropping. In its place—ice. Cold. Calculated. Unforgiving. She wouldn’t let Sadie steal what belonged to her. Not now. Not ever.
At Riverside Villa, the morning air was still. Briley emerged, half-awake, lazily slinging her bag over one shoulder as she prepared to leave.

Coyle was sitting on the leather sofa, flipping through a stack of glossy photographs. Elegant smiles, poised stances—young women from Jazmah’s most influential families. Each was a potential match for his son, Sutton, in his grand plan to secure the future of his family.
Then—A scream tore through the quiet.
“Ahhh!”
Coyle’s brow creased, irritation surfacing. What was this?
He grabbed his cane and got up to check what was happening. His voice echoed down the hall, sharp and disapproving. “What now, Briley? Why the hell are you screaming at this hour?”
Briley stumbled back inside, her face drained of color, her finger trembling as she pointed toward the door.
“Dad… outside… there’s someone—covered in blood—it’s awful! I think it’s a vagrant or something!”
A vagrant? Here?
Coyle’s frown deepened. He made his way to the entrance, his cane tapping steadily across the floor.
And then he saw it—A figure sprawled at the villa’s threshold, crumpled and soaked in grime and blood. His hair was matted, clothes torn, face barely recognizable.
“Help… please, help me…”
Coyle leaned in, taking a closer look.
His breath caught. It wasn’t a vagrant. It was Sutton. His son.
“Sutton!”
Coyle’s roar echoed through the villa as he rushed forward, barking orders for someone to bring his son to the nearest hospital. Briley was pale as a ghost, barely registering the chaos around her.
At the hospital, the antiseptic scent did nothing to mask the dread thickening in Coyle’s chest. The doctor emerged at last, his expression grim.
“Mr. Wall,” he said gently, “I’m very sorry. We did everything we could. Your son has sustained multiple injuries—five broken ribs, a crushed femur. His left leg… we had no choice. It had to be amputated.” The doctor hesitated, then added, more quietly, “There’s more. His reproductive organs were… deliberately targeted. I’m afraid this will impact the rest of his life in ways we can’t yet fully measure.”

###Chapter 702:
Coyle staggered as if struck, his face draining of color.noveldrama
His heir—his only son—was destroyed.
It felt like the sky had cracked open and come crashing down.
Briley rushed to his side, catching his arm.
“Dad! Are you alright?”
But Coyle couldn’t answer. Words abandoned him. His lungs refused to draw breath.
There was only the crushing weight of devastation pressing on his chest.
Hours blurred into a sleepless night. At dawn, Sutton finally stirred.
His eyes fluttered open—and then he saw it.
“My leg… What—where’s my leg?” His voice rose into a raw, animal scream. “No—no! It’s gone! They took my leg! They’ll pay for this! I’ll make them pay!”
Coyle stood at his son’s bedside, trembling, tears silently streaking his weathered face.
“Sutton… don’t be afraid,” he choked out, gripping his son’s hand. “I’m here. And I swear—I’ll make them pay for every drop of blood.”

Sutton clutched his father’s arm, desperation turning into fury.
“Revenge, Dad! You have to get revenge for me! It was Noah!” Sutton’s voice cracked with rage and disbelief. “That bastard—he’s not dead! He’s alive! He’s Patrick! Patrick Noel is Noah! He did this to me! He’s the one who ruined me!”
The words slammed into Coyle like a punch to the chest, Patrick… was Noah?
His blood ran cold. His mind raced.
“Shut your mouth!” Coyle barked. “You’re delirious—how could Patrick possibly be Noah? Have you completely lost your senses?” Coyle tried to hide the shock within him.
If it was true…
If Noah had survived…
And if he knew what they had done three years ago…
Then his entire family was already living on borrowed time.
Rage boiled in Coyle’s throat. He nearly choked on it.
Meanwhile, Sutton clung to his father like a man drowning, his voice rising into a manic plea.
“I swear it’s true, Dad! I saw his face! I know it was him! He came after me—he made me like this!” Tears streamed down Sutton’s face, raw and uncontrollable.
“You have to believe me! You have to get revenge for me!” Coyle stared at his son, his expression unreadable.
He wanted to dismiss it. Call it trauma-fueled nonsense.
But Sutton’s eyes—wild, glassy, desperate—weren’t the eyes of a liar.
Something inside Coyle twisted.
If Noah was still alive… Then who was in the urn?
He took several slow breaths, gripping his cane like a lifeline. Then, with forced calm, he said, “Tell me everything. Exactly what happened. No skipping details.”
Sutton’s breath rattled in his chest. His gaze was unfocused, distant. He began recounting the events of the previous night in detail.
Coyle listened, his face growing darker with every word.
But when he heard Sutton mention that Patrick called him “Mr. Wall,” Coyle’s heart instantly lifted.
.
.
.
###Chapter 703:
A flicker of something stirred in his chest.
If Patrick was Noah… why did he call Sutton that?
Could it be… he lost his memory? Three years ago, Noah had thrown himself in front of Sadie, taken that brutal hit, and fallen into a coma.
Now, he had reappeared as Hailey’s husband, cold and hostile toward Sadie.
It didn’t seem like Sutton was mistaken.
Amnesia—it was the only explanation that made sense. And it changed everything.
Coyle’s thoughts shifted into overdrive, weaving strategy through shock.
Everyone in their world believed Noah was dead.
And for the sake of his family, Noah needed to stay that way. Coyle turned slowly toward Sutton, who lay broken in the bed, eyes glazed with pain. Coyle’s own eyes gleamed—hard, calculating.
He leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Sutton… listen to me carefully. You can’t tell a soul. Not even Briley. No one. Not a word. Understand?”

Sutton hesitated, confusion clouding his face. “Dad, why? After everything Noah has done to us, why should we help him keep his identity a secret?”
Coyle chuckled darkly, eyes narrowing with a sinister glint. “Fool! If Patrick steps into Noah’s shoes, how do you expect us to gain anything from him? Do you want to compete with Sadie alone or both her and Noah?”
In that instant, realization washed over Sutton.
“But Dad, does this mean I have to endure all this quietly? My injuries, my thirst for vengeance—should I just let it all go?” Sutton struggled to accept his broken leg and the bitter reality that he must suppress his fury and act as if nothing had occurred, despite all he had suffered.
Coyle’s lips curled into a malicious grin. “Of course not, Sutton. Trust me, you will get your justice. He will pay dearly—tenfold. But this isn’t the right moment. We must bide our time.”
A dangerous gleam flickered in Coyle’s gaze, his words laced with madness.
Abruptly, he turned toward the doorway, signaling Sutton to hold his tongue. Sutton caught on immediately and clamped his mouth shut.
Footsteps echoed from the hallway. Briley stepped in, carrying a food tray. Concern shadowed her face as she looked at her brother lying weakly in the hospital bed.
“Sutton, you’re awake. How are you feeling? Are you hungry? I brought your favorite—chicken noodle soup.”
She moved to hand Sutton the bowl, but Sutton smacked it away, sending the contents splattering onto the floor.
Briley gasped, her complexion draining. “Sutton, what’s wrong? Are you in pain?”
Sutton stared blankly at the ceiling, ignoring her completely. Panic rising, Briley turned to Coyle. “Dad, what’s happening to him?”
Coyle’s tone was firm. “Briley, leave us. I need to speak privately with him.”
Sutton.”
Hearing this, Briley hesitated for a moment before nodding, casting a worried glance at her brother before exiting. Earlier, while outside the room, she had overheard fragments of their conversation. Though much was unclear, the names “Noah” and “Patrick” stood out sharply.

###Chapter 704:
Briley took a deep breath, trying to compose herself as she pretended nothing had happened. She quietly left the hospital room. Coyle shut the door gently behind her.
“Sutton, remember what I’ve said. From this point forward, you know nothing. Keep your focus on healing. Let me handle the rest.” Sutton eyed his father with uncertainty. “Dad, how do you plan to strike back at him?” Coyle sneered, his voice low and deliberate. “Strike back at Noah? Not yet. First, we stabilize things and gain full control over Wall Group. Once that’s done, even if Patrick turns out to be Noah, there’s little he can do.”
Sutton’s eyes widened with sudden understanding. “Are you suggesting we use Sadie against him?” A cold smirk spread across Coyle’s face, eyes sharp as a blade. “Sadie is both Noah’s wife and Wall Group’s current leader. If we aim to seize control, it starts with her.”
Without wasting a moment, Coyle pulled out his phone and made a call. “Dig into Sadie’s and Patrick’s every move last night. Also, prepare a resignation letter in Sutton’s name and forward it to Wall Group.”
“Understood, sir.”
Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office at Wall Group, Sadie sat behind her desk, absently turning a mask over in her hand, her thoughts tangled. The events of the previous night still felt unreal, like fragments of a strange dream. Now that she was awake, all that remained was fatigue and a growing sense of unease.
 сαρ gν﹒сｍnoveldrama
Sadie rubbed her temples, trying to clear her head. Now was not the time to dwell on these matters. There were still many issues at Wall Group that required her attention. The phone on her desk rang.
“Ms. Hudson, the HR manager called. Sutton has submitted his resignation!” Samuel’s voice came through clearly.
Sadie’s brow furrowed.
“Sutton? After clinging desperately to Wall Group, now he suddenly wanted out? It didn’t add up.”
“Put him through,” she said evenly, hiding her suspicions.
Moments later, the HR manager’s voice filled the line.
“Ms. Hudson, Sutton’s resignation letter just arrived. Should we accept or reject it?”
The HR manager’s voice was cautious, as he was confused by the situation.
“What reason did he give?” Sadie asked, her fingers rhythmically tapping her desk.
“Health concerns,” came the reply. “He claims he needs to step down from all positions due to his poor health.”
“Seriously? Since when did Sutton become so delicate?”
Sadie scoffed. Sutton was clearly lying—he wasn’t sick; he was definitely scheming something.
“Hold off on processing the resignation for now. There’s no rush,” she instructed coolly.
“Understood, Ms. Hudson,” the HR manager responded before ending the call.
Sadie’s gaze grew colder, suspicion brewing beneath the surface. What game was Sutton playing this time?
A knock broke her train of thought, followed by Samuel’s voice from outside the office.
“Ms. Hudson.”
“Come in,” she replied, masking her concerns with a neutral tone. Samuel stepped inside, holding a file, his demeanor calm and unreadable.

###“This document needs your signature today,” he informed her.noveldrama
Sadie took the file and flipped through it absentmindedly. Without signing, she peered up and questioned, “Any updates on Coyle and his son?”
Samuel hesitated for a beat before answering. “Coyle is by Sutton’s side at the hospital today. Nothing suspicious. Briley, however, has been seen near the Howe Manor a lot lately, like she’s digging for something…” Samuel reported truthfully.
Sadie’s frown deepened as unease settled in. Briley sniffing around Howe Manor could only spell trouble.
“Shadow Briley closely and report anything unusual.”
“Understood, Ms. Hudson,” Samuel replied before heading out.
One day, Briley stood once again outside the grand entrance of Howe Manor. She had long lost track of how many times she’d been turned away. The butler stood firm, his voice formal but clearly irritated.
“Miss Wall, I’ve mentioned this before—Mr. Howe has no time for visitors. Please, go.”
Briley forced a polite smile, struggling to keep her frustration in check.

“I promise, this is something Alex would want to hear.”
The butler, however, was unmoved, his patience thinning.
“Miss Wall, kindly don’t press further. Mr. Howe’s schedule is beyond my control.”
Before Briley could argue, the butler gestured for security.
Immediately, a guard approached, clearly ready to escort her away.
Briley’s expression turned sour, but arguing further would only disgrace her. Frustrated, she bit her lip and tightened her fists.
In the end, retreat was her only option. Briley stifled her rage, determined to walk through the gates with confidence and composure one day, proving to all that she was not someone to be underestimated. She made her way back to her home.
Inside the living room, Coyle sat comfortably, reviewing a document, a rare grin revealing his cheerful mood.
Briley’s curiosity got the better of her.
“Dad, what’s the good news?” she inquired.
Coyle lifted his gaze, his grin broadening at the sight of his daughter. He said enthusiastically, “Come here, Briley. I’ve got to show you this.”
He passed the document to Briley.
As Briley unfolded it, her eyes widened in disbelief. It was the Wall Group’s share transfer agreement—bearing Sadie’s name as the recipient.
Briley stared at her father, stunned.
“Dad, what…”
Coyle’s lips curled into a smug smirk. “Sadie’s cornered now—there’s no escape.”
Briley’s heart raced. She had long harbored resentment toward Sadie, and now victory seemed within reach. The thought filled her with satisfaction.
After a brief pause, Coyle added thoughtfully, “By the way, you’ll accompany me to Wall Manor tomorrow.”
Briley raised an eyebrow, confused.
.

###Chapter 706:
“Wall Manor? Why?”
A calculating glint flashed in Coyle’s eyes. “You’ll find out soon enough. We need everyone on our side to ensure Sadie is left with no allies.”
Although still unclear on the details, Briley nodded. “Alright, Dad.”
The following day, Sadie entered the company as usual, ready to tackle her daily tasks. Suddenly, Samuel burst in, visibly anxious.
“Ms. Hudson, we have a serious problem. Our team slipped up, and Coyle exploited the situation.”
Sadie glanced up from her paperwork, brows knitting. “What are you saying?”
Samuel’s face was grim. “Coyle quietly arranged for someone to dig into that night’s events.”
Sadie’s expression hardened. The incident in the apartment—the one meticulously planned—why was Coyle prying into it now? A ripple of unease passed through her.
Just then, a Wall Manor servant, guided in by the receptionist, stepped forward. With a formal tone but clear authority, she said, “Ms. Hudson, the family elders request your presence at Wall Manor. They have questions for you.”noveldrama
Sadie quickly grasped the gravity of the situation—this confrontation was inevitable now. Coyle had made his move swiftly.

Samuel’s concern deepened. “Ms. Hudson, this isn’t looking good.”
Sadie was composed and faintly smiling as she scanned the office. “Seems like there’s going to be a change in leadership here.”
Samuel’s worry intensified. “You could be in danger!”
Sadie turned back to him with a calm smile. “Don’t worry, I’ll handle it.” She followed the servant toward Wall Manor.
Outside the gates, the mood was tense. Many people had been denied entry, visibly displeased. Isabel waited by the entrance. Catching sight of Sadie, she quickly approached, subtly signaling caution.
Sadie gave a slight nod, understanding the silent warning. She knew full well that today’s confrontation would be anything but easy.
Sadie walked into the grand hall of Wall Manor, her steps echoing through the room. Several family elders were already seated, their faces set into stern expressions. Coyle and Briley stood in the center of the room, with the former looking smug and arrogant, convinced he had finally cornered Sadie.
There was another key person present—Sutton. He sat in a wheelchair, his left leg gone. His face was ashen, and his eyes were downcast.
Sadie turned to him with feigned surprise. “What happened, Sutton? Did you take a tumble somewhere?”
Sutton glared at her, gritting his teeth at her mocking tone. He wanted to stand up and rant at her, but the pain in his leg was unbearable, even while sitting. Coyle placed a hand on his son’s shoulder and squeezed, silently telling him to calm down.
When he looked back at Sadie, his expression was mournful, and a few tears even fell from his eyes. “Sadie, I’m aware that you have many grievances against my family, but why would you hurt Sutton? You should just take out all your anger on me.”
Coyle choked on his words, deliberately trying to sound more pitiful. “Sutton may make mistakes here and there, but he is still your cousin-in-law. How could you be so ruthless and have him beaten like this?” He let out a dramatic sigh before adding, “Well, I suppose I understand. The Wall Group is now fully under your control. My family and I are powerless against you.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 707:noveldrama
He then turned to address the elders. “Our family shall withdraw all participation in the company and we will never interfere with Wall Group’s affairs again. Rest assured, Sadie. Sutton has already submitted his resignation. He will no longer be an obstacle to you. All we ask is that you spare him from your cruelty and grant us the grace befitting the chairwoman of Wall Group.”
As Coyle spoke this last part, he stood before Sadie and began to crouch, as if he was about to kneel at her feet.
Of course, Briley rushed forward to stop him. “Dad, don’t do this. Your health isn’t the best.”
They had perfected the craft of portraying themselves as the victims, and now Sadie looked like the unforgivable villainess.
It was then that one of the elders, a man with significant authority, stood up. His expression was severe. “Sadie, we received some photos this morning…” He gestured for a servant to bring the photos forward.
Sadie gave them only a fleeting glance. The images showed her in the company of a man wearing a silver mask, and from the angles of the camera, their behavior appeared intimate and suggestive. The shots had been deliberately framed to create the impression of something inappropriate taking place.
“Who is the man in these photos?” the elder demanded. “The Wall family has always treated you well, haven’t we? It hasn’t been long since Noah passed away—the mourning period hasn’t even ended yet. Is this how you repay the Wall family’s generosity over the years? Gallivanting with some dubious-looking man and starting a scandal? This is a violation of family rules, a disgrace to our family name!”
The elder’s words carried absolute authority, and the atmosphere in the hall grew cold with each one. Everyone stared at Sadie, waiting for her to explain herself.

Sadie took in the elder’s self-righteous demeanor and couldn’t help the laughter that burst out of her. Her hands slowly balled into fists at her sides as she raised her chin, calmly sweeping her gaze over the room. “Sirs,” she said, her voice calm, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Coyle’s head jerked up in surprise, his eyes narrowing. He hadn’t expected Sadie to remain composed under such pressure. “Sadie,” Coyle spoke again, this time sounding anguished. “Why are you still pretending? If the woman in the photos isn’t you, then who is?”
“Saddie, you vile woman!” Sutton suddenly interjected. “Even with the evidence before our eyes, you still dare to deny the truth? I’m telling you, it’s pointless! I’ve already told the elders everything. I’ve exposed your affair with that masked man! You and I both know that’s the real reason my leg is now gone.”
Hot, angry tears streamed down his face as he pointed to his bandaged leg. “Sirs, you must uphold my dignity as a member of this family! This outsider is wicked, without any shame or remorse!”
Sutton’s cries echoed through the hall, raw and pitiful—his pain on full display. Every sob, every word, only deepened the weight in the room. The family elders sat in grim silence, their expressions darkening with each passing second. Their eyes slowly turned toward Sadie, laden with judgment, disappointment, and quiet condemnation.
Sadie stood rigid, fists clenched so tightly that her nails bit into her palms. Her blood boiled beneath her skin.
Shameless. Absolutely shameless. Coyle and Sutton had orchestrated every step, trapping her and then painting her as the villain. How despicable!
But now wasn’t the time to lash out. Not yet. She had no proof, no concrete evidence that Patrick was Noah. Nothing that could solidify her claim. If she spoke out now, they’d tear her apart—and Coyle would be the first to twist the knife.
.
.
.
###Chapter 708:
So, she breathed—slow, sharp, steady—and lifted her head, her eyes locking onto Coyle’s. Her voice was calm, but her gaze was icy. “You accuse me of infidelity and disgrace upon the family, but where’s your proof?” She gestured toward the photos on the table. “You’re ready to convict me based on some blurry images and Sutton’s sob story? Absurd!”
Coyle stepped forward, sneering. “These photos are all the proof we need. Don’t waste your breath defending yourself.” His voice rose with self-righteous fury. “You’ve always resented Sutton and me—fine. But to throw the family name into the mud out of spite? It’s beneath even you, Sadie.”
Then, without warning, his voice dropped—cold and quiet. “I know. I know that Patrick… is Noah. You thought you could keep it hidden? He’s got amnesia. No memory, no clue who he really is. Right now, he’s a blank slate. If I were to expose his true identity… tell me, Sadie—would he become your ally? Or just a victim in someone else’s scheming?”
Sadie stared at him, a flicker of disbelief in her eyes—but beneath that, a cold, rising rage. How did Coyle know that Patrick was Noah? She didn’t even know for sure!
What was going on?
Her mind raced with questions. Every instinct screamed for her to voice them, but not yet. Not here.
Updates loaded now at gα?ησνe?s?com
Since Coyle already knew that Patrick was Noah and was using it to threaten her, it was clear he was ready for war.
Sadie’s fists clenched tightly at her sides, her pulse roaring in her ears. She had to tread carefully.noveldrama
If what Coyle said was true… if Noah’s memory loss was real… then he was in danger.
Exposing his identity now wouldn’t save him—it would destroy him. He’d be torn apart by wolves.
She bit her lower lip, forcing herself to hold her tongue. Her silence was calculated. Controlled. Strategic.
But Coyle mistook it for surrender. His grin widened, smug and cruel.
“So—you’ve got nothing to say? That says everything, doesn’t it?” He turned toward the others, raising his voice with faux solemnity. “Everyone, you’ve seen it for yourselves. Sadie has effectively admitted to disgracing the Wall family—with scandal, infidelity, and betrayal. The evidence speaks for itself! A woman like this has no right to hold the reins of the Wall Group any longer. For the sake of the family’s dignity, I suggest that Sadie be immediately removed from her position as chairwoman—effective today.”
The elders exchanged uneasy glances, their expressions shadowed with dismay.
Sadie, the once-unshakable figurehead of the company, now stood accused without defense.
Such a disgrace!
One of the elders finally rose, his voice grave with disappointment.
“Sadie, we entrusted you with the future of this family. We held you in the highest regard. But now? To see you stoop to such shameless behavior—it’s beneath even our darkest expectations. There’s no room for sentimentality in the face of disgrace. Let it be known—Sadie is hereby removed from her post as chairwoman of the Wall Group, effective immediately. Coyle will assume the position for now.”
Then came the final strike. “And as for Sadie… for dragging our family name through the mud, she will be punished accordingly. That is fifty whips.”
It was a verdict, as final and cold as a judge’s gavel striking stone.

###Chapter 709:
Across the hall, Isabel’s eyes widened in horror.
She stood up abruptly, her voice trembling.
“But, Sadie—I—”
But before she could speak another word, Sadie shook her head slightly, a silent signal telling her not to speak.
Coyle had sealed every exit and twisted every truth to deceive the elders.
Any attempt to speak now would only dig the grave deeper.noveldrama
Sadie’s silence wasn’t surrender. It was strategy.
Isabel saw it in her eyes. Her chest tightened, tears stinging her eyes as she slowly sat back down—helpless, aching.
She could only watch as Sadie, unbowed and silent, was seized by the guards.
Sadie felt an unbearable sting rip across her back, every strike threatening to crush her bones.
She clenched her jaw, forcing herself to remain alert.
F ?  g?ν.
She refused to crumble before Coyle and those on his side.
One lash, then another… The sharp crack of leather seared into Isabel’s chest.
She yearned to intervene, but the staff restrained her, holding her fast. Helpless, Isabel could only watch as Sadie endured the torment, her face streaked with tears of agony.
What felt like an endless nightmare finally concluded after fifty brutal lashes.
Sadie was drenched in crimson, her limbs numb and her mind clouded. The staff hauled her away to a room, with Isabel trailing behind in haste.
“Sadie, speak to me!” Isabel’s voice broke, thick with emotion.
Sadie cracked her eyes open and forced a weak grin.
“I’m alright, Isabel. Don’t fret.”
“How can you say that?” Isabel whispered bitterly. “I failed to shield you.”
Sadie longed to reach out, to console her, but her strength had all but vanished.
“This is what they intended,” Sadie murmured. “Go back. Rest. I’ll recover soon.”
Sadie didn’t want Isabel burdened with her fragile state. Yet Isabel hesitated.
Seeing this, Sadie added, “If you remain, I won’t find peace. Keep watch on Coyle and his team. We can’t risk them making another move.”
The words struck Isabel like lightning.
Staying would only make things worse.
Wiping away her tears, she nodded.
“Alright. I’ll leave now. Call for me if you need anything.”
Sadie gave a faint nod, watching Isabel depart, glancing back with every step.
Once alone, Sadie finally let go of her composure as a wave of pain swept over her, stealing the air from her lungs. Moments later, Samuel arrived with a physician in tow.
His expression darkened at the sight of Sadie’s condition.
“Doctor, quickly!” he ordered.
The doctor sprang into action.
The injuries were ghastly—her back raw and marred.
As the ointment was applied, the doctor spoke gently. “Ms. Hudson, your wounds are severe. Fifty lashes… they were merciless. You must rest and avoid exertion.”
.

###Chapter 710:
Sadie bit down on the scream building in her throat.
This pain was nothing compared to what she had already endured. After the doctor completed the treatment and relayed his advice, he gathered his equipment and departed.
Samuel saw him out, then quietly returned to Sadie’s side, burdened with remorse.
“Ms. Hudson, forgive me. I didn’t foresee their plot, and now this has happened.”
Sadie gave a faint shake of her head, her complexion ghostly pale. “You’re not to blame. Their snare was set long before today, simply waiting for me to stumble into it. There was no avoiding it.”
Samuel’s brows furrowed. He was unwilling to accept her reasoning.
“But Ms. Hudson, you didn’t have to go through this. You could’ve clarified everything. Perhaps the elders wouldn’t have sided with Coyle.”
“Clarify?” A bitter laugh escaped Sadie’s lips. “Do you believe they would’ve let me speak?”
She paused, her tone laced with bitterness. “Coyle’s family has long aimed to oust me from the chairwoman seat. Even if I had explained, they would’ve devised another scheme. It’s wiser to bide my time.”
Full chapter updat3z at glnovels.
Samuel still struggled to grasp her strategy.
“But Ms. Hudson, this price is steep. You’re gravely wounded, and now Coyle has seized the chairperson role. Is it truly worth it?”
Sadie’s gaze turned cold, a sly smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. “Only by doing this can I make them lower their defenses and eventually expose their ambitions. Coyle’s hunger for the Wall Group is no secret. Let him enjoy his false victory—I’ll reclaim it when the time is right.”
Additionally, what lay ahead required her to remain unnoticed. Samuel’s eyes lit up with realization, admiration clear in his expression.
Ms. Hudson was remarkable! Even in such a dire situation, she remained composed, just like Mr. Wall in the past.
“Ms. Hudson, you can count on me. I’ll see it through.”
Sadie nodded approvingly.
“The next steps are yours. Keep a sharp eye on Coyle and his actions.” She paused briefly, her expression darkening as a memory surfaced.
“Also, tighten security around Patrick.”
Samuel was puzzled by this instruction.
“Ms. Hudson, you’re already navigating a dangerous path. Why worry about Patrick now?”
Sadie’s gaze fell, her features softening with a trace of complexity. “He’s important. With his memory gone, he’s vulnerable. I won’t let Coyle get to him.”
Patrick’s true identity was still uncertain, so she shouldn’t tell anyone about her suspicions now.
Though not fully comprehending, Samuel gave a respectful nod.
“Understood, Ms. Hudson. I’ll see to it.”
Sadie quietly acknowledged him, weary, and motioned for him to leave. Once alone, she stared blankly at the ceiling, her mind adrift. Waves of sharp pain coursed through her, yet they were nothing compared to the heaviness weighing on her heart. Just then, the door creaked open once more.
Briley strode in, document in hand, her smug demeanor filling the room. “Sadie, sign this,” she ordered, tossing the papers onto the nightstand, her voice thick with disdain.
.

###Chapter 711:
Sadie’s weary eyes drifted to the document—a stock transfer contract. They weren’t even pretending to be patient.
A wry smile ghosted across her lips as she rasped, “How kind of you, Briley, to deliver it yourself.”
Without hesitation, Sadie grasped the pen and, with slow determination, signed her name.
Sadie looked like she was half-dead at this point. Briley stared at her, feeling a fresh surge of anger.
What a despicable woman! Why wouldn’t she just give up pretending? The thing was, although Alex had already slept with Briley, his heart belonged solely to Sadie.
There was nothing Briley wanted more than for her rival to disappear for good.
Her eyes flashed briefly with malice, but she plastered a concerned look on her face as she approached.
“Sadie, do your wounds still hurt?” Briley asked, her hand reaching for Sadie’s back.
A cold glint appeared in Sadie’s eyes. Such petty tricks were pathetic and laughable to her.
  ? .noveldrama
Just as Briley’s fingers were about to brush against her wounds, Sadie whipped around and shot out her arm.
A sharp, cracking sound echoed in the room as her palm landed on Briley’s cheek.
Briley’s eyes were wide with shock, her hand immediately coming up to cup her swelling cheek. “How dare you slap me!”
Sadie gave her a look that said she didn’t care.
She grabbed the stock transfer contract from the table and flung it at Briley. A stray piece of paper drifted too close and cut her other cheek with its corner, leaving a thin trail of blood on her skin.
“I’m warning you,” Sadie said in a chilling voice. “If I die here today, none of you will get away unscathed. The world will think that you and your dear old father drove me to death just to get your hands on the family assets, and they wouldn’t be wrong. When that happens, what do you think is going to happen to the Wall Group’s stock price?”
Briley gritted her teeth. Though she loathed to admit it, she was intimidated by Sadie’s overwhelming presence.
Moreover, if Sadie did die here in Wall Manor, the outside world would surely suspect that they had orchestrated it in one way or another. Wall Group’s stock price would plummet, and it would possibly even attract regulatory investigations.
No, this wasn’t what Briley or Coyle wanted.
Still, Briley refused to back down. “Your words are nothing more than empty threats. They don’t scare me. The elders were right to punish you for the disgrace you brought upon this family. It has nothing to do with us.”
Sadie sneered. “Is that so? You’d better hope that’s the case. Otherwise, I promise, I will haunt you even from the grave.”
Briley sputtered into silence, terrified by Sadie’s sinister gaze. Furious at her reaction, she turned on her heel and stormed out of the room.
Silence crept in.
Sadie exhaled slowly, her tense nerves finally relaxing. She was no longer the Sadie from three years ago, after all. Gone was the woman they used to bully, the one who would choose to take it all without putting up a fight.
.

###Chapter 712:
Meanwhile, Briley hurried back to the living room with the document. “Dad, that bitch signed it.”noveldrama
Coyle reviewed the contract carefully, his lips curling into a smile when he saw the signature. This contract ensured that the Wall Group was entirely his.
He let out a bark of triumphant laughter.
Coyle then made a call and instructed his assistant to prepare for a visit to Ralph’s house. All he had to do now was win over the Castro family, and his position in the company would be rock solid.
“Yes, sir,” the assistant replied and made the necessary arrangements. It wasn’t until Coyle hung up that he suddenly remembered something. “Where is your brother?”
Briley’s eyes darted around nervously. “Sutton said he was going to get revenge on some wretch, but I’m not sure who.”
Coyle clicked his tongue and waved his hand dismissively. “Oh, let him do what he wants. Let’s not worry about him.”
That afternoon, Coyle arrived at Ralph’s place with several gifts. The butler opened the door for him and his assistant, and they were led inside.
Ralph was resting in the living room with his eyes closed. When he heard the commotion at the foyer, his eyes flew open, his gaze instantly sharp and discerning.
 с g?[．]
Coyle forced a smile and approached respectfully. “I’ve long admired you, Mr. Castro. It’s an honor to meet with you today.” Ralph’s face remained blank, indifferent.
“This is an unexpected visit, Mr. Wall,” Ralph replied, not bothering with pleasantries.
Coyle faltered, his smile turning awkward, but he quickly recovered. “Here, Mr. Castro,” he said warmly. “I’ve brought some gifts as a token of my respect and admiration. Please accept them.” He signaled his assistant to come forward with the bags.
Ralph didn’t glance at the items. Instead, he turned to a nearby servant and waved his hand. “Show them out.”
This time, Coyle’s smile completely vanished, and his expression turned dark. He hadn’t expected Ralph to be so short with him.
“Mr. Castro,” he said again, his tone firmer. “Perhaps you aren’t aware yet, but I am now the chairman of the Wall Group.” He placed the stock transfer contract on the table. “Sadie signed it herself. Are you sure you want to keep that attitude around me?”
Coyle assumed that the old man would change his tune, if only for the company’s sake.
But Ralph only shot him a mocking smile. “Do you think I’ve gone senile just because I’m old? Do you think I don’t know your schemes? Have you forgotten that your father banned you and your children from leading the Wall Group?”
Coyle’s expression shifted at that, but he shamelessly plowed ahead. “Let’s be frank with each other, shall we? I came here with a proposition. What do you think about our two families joining forces to manage Wall Group together?”
Ralph laughed as though he had just heard the most ridiculous joke. Just then, a carefree voice joined the conversation. “I heard barking from upstairs and wondered what it was. Turns out it’s just Mr. Wall, gracing us with his… presence.” Blaine sauntered in, looking like sarcasm incarnate. “I can’t believe the servants let you in to disturb my peace. What a nuisance!”
Blaine nodded at the guards stationed by the door. “What are you waiting for? Get this pathetic fool and his lackey out of here! The mere sight of them is ruining my day.” Coyle’s face turned beet red with rage.
.
.
.
###Chapter 713:
This rascal had dared to call him names right to his face! It was outrageous! Absolutely unacceptable! Coyle pointed a trembling finger at Blaine.
“Watch your mouth, kid! I’m now the chairman of Wall Group. How dare you insult me like this?”
Blaine poked his pinky finger into his ear and let out an impatient huff. “The chairman? I don’t give a damn. Who do you think you are, barging into our home and putting on airs in front of us? Get out before you taint this place any further!”
Blaine gestured at the guards, who immediately stepped forward and seized Coyle and his assistant. They were unceremoniously tossed out the door, along with their gifts.
Ralph watched it all unfold, his expression unchanged, making no move to intervene.
Once Coyle and his assistant left, Ralph turned to Blaine, his voice calm but weighted. “Now, tell me—what’s going on?”
He knew Blaine well. The boy could act like a lazy vagabond half the time, but when it came to serious matters, Blaine didn’t play around. Blaine stepped forward, his usual smirk replaced by a rare seriousness. He laid everything out—what happened at Wall Manor; Sadie’s brutal beating, the photographs used to smear her name.noveldrama
Ralph listened in silence. But when Blaine mentioned the violence Sadie had endured, Ralph’s expression darkened. His brows drew together, and he let out a long, heavy sigh. “Beaten that severely… Those people… the Wall family is colder than I thought.”
? ?  at ν
Still, he knew—this was the fire Sadie had to walk through. Coyle’s hunger for power was insatiable. And Sadie? She was the greatest obstacle in his way. What troubled Ralph wasn’t the attack itself—it was the depravity of the method. He hadn’t expected Coyle to go that far.
Blaine, frowning, leaned in. “Grandpa, what now? Are we just going to stand by? Shouldn’t we help Sadie?”
Ralph didn’t answer right away. “We shouldn’t interfere too deeply in the Wall family’s affairs. Sadie must learn to stand on her own,” Ralph said firmly, his voice measured. He paused, his eyes meeting Blaine’s with quiet gravity. “But ensure her safety. Stay in the shadows if you must—but help her when she needs it.”
Blaine gave a slight nod, already understanding the unspoken meaning behind the words. This wasn’t abandonment—it was calculated support.
Early the next morning, the atmosphere inside the Wall Group’s boardroom was thick with anticipation. Executives whispered in corners. Then, Coyle entered and took the head seat.
“Ladies and gentlemen, today’s meeting is convened to address two critical matters,” he said smoothly, hands folded atop the polished table. “First, there have been some… unsavory rumors regarding my niece-in-law, Sadie. Let me clarify—Sadie is currently unwell and in need of rest. After an internal consensus, it has been unanimously agreed that she will be relieved of her duties as the chairwoman of the Wall Group.”
The room erupted in stunned murmurs. Many had caught whispers of the drama the day before, but the news still shocked everyone. After all, everyone knew what Sadie had accomplished. Since she took the helm of the Wall Group, her leadership had revitalized the company. To see her ousted so abruptly left a bitter taste in everyone’s mouths.
But Coyle, drunk on power, was unmoved. He raised a hand, silencing the murmurs. “Now, the second matter. Following a unanimous decision, I will be assuming the position of acting chairman effective immediately. I’ll be overseeing all daily operations until further notice.” Finally, the title he’d coveted for so long was his. And he didn’t waste a second. He rattled off a string of new appointments—placing his loyalists into every key department. One by one, he buried Sadie’s legacy beneath layers of control.
.
.
.
###Chapter 714:
By the time he was finished, the Wall Group’s upper structure was his in all but name.
Noah’s ears caught wind of this before long. In the quiet of his study, Noah sat behind a broad desk as his assistant delivered the latest report. Noah’s expression was impassive, calm. Coyle’s moves were bold—but predictable.
Yet, when he heard that Sadie had been ousted—and beaten so viciously—something in his chest gave a quiet, involuntary jolt. A flicker crossed Noah’s face. Almost imperceptible. His brow furrowed. He tried to dismiss the sudden weight pressing on his chest.
Yet, despite himself, the words left his mouth before he could stop them. “How is Sadie now?”
The assistant blinked, clearly caught off guard. Since when did Patrick care about Sadie? Still, he recovered quickly and gave a respectful nod.
“She’s resting in Wall Manor. Alive, but… not in good shape.”
Noah leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled beneath his chin.
“Proceed as planned.”
?  ’?   ν．
“Yes, Mr. Noel.”
The assistant gave a quick nod and exited the study. Just as the door clicked shut, the butler stepped in, his face taut with unease.
“Mr. Noel,” he said hurriedly, “Ms. Burgess is missing.”
Noah’s head snapped up, his gaze sharpening like a blade. “What?”
“She went out shopping last night and never returned. We’ve tried calling, but her phone’s off. Our people are already searching, but… no leads yet.”noveldrama
The butler swallowed hard.
Noah’s brows furrowed, tension rippling beneath his calm exterior. His mind flashed to Sutton’s failed plot against Hailey that had nearly destroyed Sadie instead. A chill crept down his spine.
“Keep looking. Turn the city upside down if you have to. Find her. Immediately.”
“Understood, Mr. Noel.”
The butler bowed and rushed out, already barking orders into his phone.
Meanwhile, in a lavish hotel suite, Hailey lay crumpled on the cold marble floor, wrists and ankles bound cruelly tight. A dirty cloth was shoved into her mouth, muffling her cries into helpless whimpers.
Terror swelled in her chest as she scanned the room. Several large men loomed nearby, their eyes gleaming with sadistic amusement, grinning like wolves circling prey.
Then came the low creak of the door—and slowly a wheelchair glided into the room, carrying Sutton.
Hailey’s heart stopped. Just seeing him—like that—was enough to shake her to her core. He was here for revenge. And he wasn’t hiding it.
Two of his subordinates stepped forward and hoisted her roughly off the floor. Her feet dangled, body thrashing against their grip, but she couldn’t break free.
Sutton rolled closer. He reached out, fingers brushing her cheek in slow, deliberate strokes—each touch colder than the last.
There was hatred in his eyes.
Hailey shivered, bile rising in her throat.
Without warning, Sutton’s hand shot to her throat. Hailey’s eyes bulged as her breath vanished, her lungs burning. She kicked, thrashed, screamed against the cloth—but no one moved. No one helped.
.
.
.
###Chapter 715:
Sutton’s voice was a venomous growl. “You wretch! Noah’s alive—and you dared lie to me. Because of you, I ended up like this. You’ll pay for what he’s done to me!”
Hailey shook her head desperately, panic overtaking her.
He finally let go, and she gasped as the cloth was yanked from her mouth. She choked and coughed, struggling to fill her lungs with air again.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” she gasped, her voice weak and trembling.
Sutton remained quiet, casting a sharp glance at the subordinates behind him. They understood the signal instantly and sprang into action. Their movements were harsh and aggressive, leaving no doubt about their intent. Sutton’s goal was clear—he wanted to degrade and torment Hailey in front of everyone.
With a keen interest, he positioned a camera to the side, carefully adjusting its angle. It was only then that Hailey truly grasped what he was planning, and an overwhelming wave of fear washed over her.
“No, Sutton, please, don’t do this. I made a mistake—I admit it. I’ll do whatever you ask, I swear. We can work together again. I’ll even help you deal with Noah.”
Her voice wavered as she rambled desperately, saying anything that might change Sutton’s mind. She was willing to do whatever it took to escape this nightmare.
  ?  g?ν
Sutton shook his head, his expression devoid of warmth.
“Do you honestly think I’d trust you again, Hailey? You’ve deceived me over and over, treating me like a fool. You’ve been out of control lately—it’s time you learned a lesson.”
Without another word, he signaled for his men to continue.
The next two hours were filled with Hailey’s anguished cries and the merciless laughter of those around her. As time passed, her voice grew weaker until it was nothing more than a hoarse whisper. Eventually, she stopped struggling altogether, sinking into complete despair.noveldrama
Sutton watched it all through the lens of his camera, a satisfied smirk forming on his lips. As he reviewed the recording, he sneered.
“Next time you step out of line, I’ll make sure there’s more waiting for you.”
Hailey’s head snapped up, her eyes burning with fury. Her voice, though strained, was laced with venom.
“What more do you want? You already have something to use against me—what else could you possibly need?”
Sutton chuckled, clearly amused.
“Relax, you’ll be fine—as long as you obey. Play by my rules, and you’ll have all the wealth you could desire. I’ll contact you when the time comes. Just follow instructions.”
With that, he turned and walked away, leaving Hailey alone in the hotel room. She slowly shifted her gaze to the mirror. Bruises marred her skin, her appearance utterly ruined. Her fury simmered beneath the surface. Sutton—that despicable bastard.
Why hadn’t Noah finished him off when he had the chance? Letting him live had been a grave mistake. But if no one else would take care of him, she would. Sutton had to die!
Her expression hardened as the murderous intent took root in her heart. She quickly composed herself and returned to the suburban villa, arriving just as Noah was about to leave.
When he saw her, his expression remained impassive, as if she were a mere acquaintance.
.
.
.
###Chapter 716:
“Noah, where are you going?” she asked, keeping her voice soft, trying to mask her turmoil.
“Just rest at home.” Noah’s tone was detached, uninterested. Without waiting for a reply, he turned and walked out. Unease crept into Hailey’s chest. Noah’s demeanor had been increasingly distant lately. Was he beginning to suspect something? The thought sent a chill through her, but she forced herself to remain composed.
“Be careful on the road.”
Noah gave no response as he stepped into his car. The sleek Maybach pulled away from the villa, leaving her standing at the entrance, her expression darkening. As the vehicle sped off, she turned and entered the house.
Meanwhile, Noah sat in the backseat of the car, eyes closed. Hailey’s face lingered in his mind. Her delicate makeup, her practiced smile—it was the same as always. And yet, he felt nothing.
“Why?”
His voice cut through the silence. “To Wall Manor.”
The driver nodded, and as the car changed course, Noah retrieved a silver mask, slipping it on without another word.
g?ν.0,  novels
When he arrived at the grand estate, his sharp gaze landed on a familiar figure—Alex. Before returning to the country, Noah had conducted thorough research. The Howe family ranked just beneath the Walls in power, and word had it that Alex had never married, waiting all these years for Sadie.
Alex’s eyes met Noah’s, his expression unreadable.
A moment later, the manor’s butler emerged. Upon recognizing them, he stepped forward and addressed them with polite deference. “Mr. Noel, Mr. Howe, please come in.”
Noah and Alex exchanged a look before silently stepping into the estate one after the other.
Sadie sat in the garden, tending to flowers from her wheelchair. The warm sunlight cast a soft glow over her, making the scene almost serene. As footsteps approached, she lifted her head, and her expression faltered slightly when she saw Noah. The memory of that night in the apartment resurfaced, making her momentarily uneasy.
Alex immediately strode forward, concern evident in his tone. “Sadie, how are you feeling?” His eyes reflected his worry.
Sadie offered a faint smile. “I’m fine. Just minor injuries—nothing a few days of rest won’t fix.”noveldrama
Seeing Alex fuss over Sadie triggered an inexplicable irritation within Noah, a sharp stab of jealousy piercing his heart. He didn’t understand why seeing Alex care for Sadie made him uneasy. Suddenly, his patience snapped. Without warning, he gripped the handles of Sadie’s wheelchair and pushed it forward, his voice sharp. “Ms. Hudson, we have important matters to discuss. Mr. Howe should leave.”
The authority in his tone left no room for argument.
Sadie blinked in surprise, caught off guard by his abrupt behavior. Yet, she didn’t resist, allowing him to guide her away.
Behind them, Alex’s expression darkened.
He had heard of this Patrick, but it had barely been two weeks since the man’s arrival in the city—how had he already gotten so close to Sadie?
And more importantly, why did Patrick seem strangely familiar?
Alex’s brow furrowed, a quiet tension settling over him like a tightening thread. A strange, creeping unease stirred in his chest—and he couldn’t shake it.
.
.
.
###Chapter 717:
Patrick—he couldn’t put his finger on it, but something about the man didn’t sit right with him. The way he looked at Sadie. The subtle energy between them. It gnawed at him.noveldrama
Still frowning, Alex pulled out his phone and quickly typed a message. “Look into Patrick from the Burgess Group. I want everything on him.” With a tap, the message was sent.
He stared at the screen for a beat before glancing up toward the side hall.
Meanwhile, Sadie found herself in a quiet, shadowed corner with Noah.
Her back throbbed dully. She winced, jaw tightening.
Noah stood just behind her. And yet, he felt worlds apart.
Sadie bit her lip, torn. Part of her longed to blurt it all out—to tell him the truth he didn’t yet remember. But the moment wasn’t right. And she knew… timing could mean everything.
Coyle and Sutton had been watching them closely.
With Noah’s memory gone, bringing him back to the Wall family could mean disaster—for him, and for herself.
She looked up at him, her expression composed, her voice measured.
Stay connected gα?ησv?s?com
“Mr. Noel, what is it you wished to speak with me about?”
Noah’s gaze flickered, a shadow of something unspoken crossing his face. The formal tone struck him strangely.
She was speaking to him like a stranger. Like a client.
Why did that bother him?
They weren’t close. They weren’t anything.
He was supposed to see her as manipulative, opportunistic—a woman not to be trusted.
So why did her distance sting?
Noah pushed the thought aside, letting his expression settle into something cool and unreadable. “You sound awfully formal, Ms. Hudson,” he said flatly.
Sadie offered a tight smile, brittle around the edges.
“You’re the chairman of the Burgess Group—our most valuable partner. I naturally treat you with the respect your position deserves.” She paused, her gaze lowering slightly. “But with the Wall Group in chaos—pressures from inside and out—I don’t have the luxury to focus on… anything else right now. I hope you understand.”
Her voice was polite. Flawless, like a mask carefully held in place. But Noah could feel the wall she’d just built between them—brick by brick. And for reasons he couldn’t explain, it infuriated him.
So this was the Sadie everyone warned him about. Calculating. Emotionless. Driven entirely by advantage.
He let out a short, cold laugh. “So, are you going to just surrender the chairperson title to someone else like that?”
Sadie lifted her gaze slowly, meeting his eyes head-on.
“That depends entirely on you, Mr. Noel,” she said coolly.
The air between them turned razor-sharp.
Seeing Sadie’s composed facade, Noah didn’t bother with subtlety.
“Only five percent of the profit, Ms. Hudson? Isn’t that a little… stingy?”
Sadie didn’t flinch. She had expected this. Without a word, she turned and began pushing the wheelchair herself, putting deliberate distance between them.
.
.
.
###Chapter 718:
“Then tell me, Mr. Noel, what percentage are you after?” Noah let her pull ahead—only to close the gap again, effortlessly.
“Can you even afford what I want, Ms. Hudson?” His words lingered in the air, laced with implication.
Sadie’s breath caught. Just for a second.
The man before her—he was no longer the Noah from three years ago. Sharper. Bolder. Harder to read. And far more dangerous.
But she held her ground. “Then say it plainly, Mr. Noel. If it’s within my reach, I won’t refuse. I know when I need help.” As much as she hated to admit it, she needed his help now.
A flicker of something unreadable passed through Noah’s eyes. Then came that smile. He leaned in, so close his breath grazed her cheek. “Profits don’t interest me much these days… But you, Ms. Hudson… now that’s a different story.”
His presence was all-consuming. Unmistakably invasive.
Sadie’s breath hitched, her pulse quickening despite herself.
What was Patrick really after?
g?lnσνs?cóm is your escape
“Again with the jokes, Mr. Noel? Why would you be interested in someone like me?”
She forced a tight smile, wrapping composure around her like armor. “Isn’t the alliance between our families… more valuable than a single person?”
The playful glint in Noah’s eyes dimmed, replaced by something more guarded.
This woman was composed, strategic—always finding a way to turn the personal into business.
Noah straightened, the heat between them cooling into something far more formal.
“Since we’re being direct, Ms. Hudson… Here’s what I want—thirty percent of the Wall Group’s shares. And exclusive cooperation rights on all major projects for the next five years.”
Sadie’s composure faltered for a second—just long enough for her eyes to widen.
Patrick’s request really took her by surprise.
Thirty percent. That would give him significant control. A stake in every decision. And five years of locked-in exclusivity… It was quite an ask.
She inhaled slowly, then narrowed her gaze, her tone cool and edged. “That’s quite a demand, Mr. Noel. I may be cornered right now—but I haven’t lost everything. Are you leveraging my crisis now?”
“It’s a small price to pay for helping you reclaim your position in Wall Group, Ms. Hudson.”
Sadie remained silent.
“Ahem.” A cough suddenly shattered the tense silence that had fallen in the hall. It was Isabel.
She walked closer, peering at the masked man with her brows furrowed.
Why did he seem so familiar?noveldrama
Before she could ask, however, Noah excused himself.
He made a brief reminder to Sadie to take care of herself and told her they would settle the division of profits later. Then he turned on his heel and left.
Isabel just stood there, watching in a daze. By the time she returned to her senses, Noah was gone.
She quickly grabbed Sadie’s arm, her tone urgent when she asked, “Who was that just now?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 719:
Sadie knew Isabel had some suspicions. Feeling conflicted, she averted her teary eyes.
The more people knew about Patrick’s identity, the more danger he would be in.
After mulling it over for a few seconds, Sadie came up with a harmless lie. “Don’t overthink it, Isabel. That person isn’t Noah. His name is Patrick Noel, and he is the chairman of the Burgess Group.”
“Oh,” Isabel mumbled, still a little dazed from the encounter. She thought back to the man’s figure and the tone of his voice. Sure enough, they weren’t entirely like Noah’s.
Even so, that sense of familiarity lingered at the back of her mind. “Really?” Isabel asked, still somewhat skeptical. “Are you sure about that, Sadie?”
Sadie saw the doubt in Isabel’s eyes and spoke more firmly. “I’m sure. There’s no way I wouldn’t recognize Noah. Patrick resembles him to a small extent, but that’s all. They’re definitely not the same person.”
Isabel was only half-convinced, but seeing how calm and unbothered Sadie was about the matter, she surmised that the latter wasn’t lying. Isabel relaxed. Perhaps she had been overthinking. After all, Noah had already passed away.
She sighed and patted Sadie’s hand. “I might be overthinking.” Then she decided it would be best to change the subject. “Sadie, this Patrick seems very concerned about your well-being,” she teased.
Sadie smiled but didn’t respond. Instead, she shifted the topic once more. “It’s getting late. We should head out. Everything should be ready at the resort spa by now.”

Isabel nodded and reached out to adjust Sadie’s shawl. “Let’s go, then. It will be good to clear our minds for a bit.”
Sadie quietly strategized her next move.
She couldn’t wait to see how Coyle would go about clearing up the mess she had left behind.
This would also be the perfect time for her to take a break after three grueling years. More importantly, she could have some much-needed quality time with Averi.
A servant watched the car carrying Sadie, Isabel, and Averi leave and immediately took out her phone to dial Coyle’s number. “Mr. Wall, Sadie has left Wall Manor with Isabel and Averi.”
Coyle was in his office, poring over the latest stock market trends. The servant’s report brought a smirk to his face.
Having those people leave was a very good thing, indeed. It would be even better if they never returned.
Without the chairwoman position in the company, Sadie was nothing more than a lion without its claws, powerless to do anything.
The thought brought Coyle immense pleasure. “Got it. Let them be. Have our people retreat.” With that, he hung up the phone.
Sadie was no longer a threat.noveldrama
Now, he should focus on the progress from Sutton’s side.
Coyle picked up the landline and made an internal call. “Go check on Sutton. How are the negotiations with the Burgess Group going?”
“Understood, Mr. Wall. I’ll head over right away.” The assistant wasted no time and left to do as he was instructed.
Coyle leaned back in his chair and surveyed his spacious office. He was living his best life.

###Chapter 720:
As long as Sutton managed to secure the deal with the Burgess Group, Coyle would have no reservations about appointing him as the Wall Group’s heir.
That way, the chairman position at the Wall Group would forever belong to his family. Meanwhile, the assistant had just arrived at Sutton’s office and knocked on the door.
“Come in,” Sutton called out from the other side, sounding decidedly impatient.
The assistant entered the room and approached with respectful caution. “Mr. Wall, your father asked me to check on your progress with the Burgess Group.”
Sutton was irritably flipping through documents. When he heard the assistant’s words, his scowl only deepened. His temper was particularly volatile as of late, flaring up at the slightest inconvenience. He slammed the documents he had been reading on the desk.
“I know what I have to do! Stop pestering me about it! It’s annoying!” The assistant was visibly startled, and he shrank back in fright. He was aware that Sutton had been stewing a lot recently, so he kept his head down and tried to make himself as small as possible.
“Please don’t be upset, Mr. Sutton. Your father is only worried about you.”
Sutton snorted and rolled his eyes. “Get out!”
?   — ? g?ν﹐
The assistant let out a small sigh of relief before scampering out of the office.
Sutton glared at the closed door, feeling more irate than ever. The Burgess Group couldn’t afford to stir up any trouble, that much he was confident about. He held ample leverage over Hailey, after all. Whatever conditions the Wall Group proposed, the Burgess Group would have no choice but to comply.
Sutton took a deep breath, feeling slightly better. Then he picked up his phone and made a call. “Arrange a meeting with Hailey and Patrick for tonight.”
“Understood, Mr. Wall.”
Hailey’s pulse raced as she discovered that Sutton intended to meet with her and Noah that evening. What if Sutton lost control and exposed the video? Anxiety gnawed at her as she paced restlessly in her room. She couldn’t let him destroy everything she had built.
Just then, Noah arrived home. Forcing herself to regain composure, she went to greet him.
“Noah, where have you been?”
Noticing her pale face, Noah narrowed his eyes. “You don’t look well. What’s wrong?”
Hailey’s heart pounded, but she quickly masked it with a reassuring smile. “Nothing. I was just concerned about you.”
Carefully, she probed, “Now that Coyle has taken over Wall Group, how do you plan to manage our collaboration?”
“I’ll handle it. There’s no need to worry,” Noah replied indifferently, brushing past her on his way to the study.
A deep unease settled over Hailey. Something about Sutton’s request didn’t sit right with her. After weighing her options, she chose not to inform Noah about the meeting.
She returned to her room, changed into comfortable attire, and then hesitated before slipping a small firearm into her waistband. Standing before the mirror, she adjusted her outfit and took a steadying breath. No matter what, she had to put an end to Sutton’s threats. She wouldn’t allow anyone to dismantle what she had fought for.
Upon arrival at the Eastwood Manor, Hailey noted the eerie silence—a fitting setting for settling old scores. A cold smirk touched her lips as she stepped into the private suite. Sutton’s expression was dark, his mere presence making her stomach turn, but she greeted him with a pleasant smile. “Mr. Wall, I hope I didn’t keep you waiting too long.”

###Chapter 721:
A low chuckle escaped Sutton, his gaze filled with mockery. “Ms. Burgess, you’ve got guts showing up alone.”
His tone was taunting, as if he was sure he would always have the upper hand.noveldrama
Hailey moved closer with deliberate grace. “Well, you asked for me, and here I am.”
She deliberately softened her tone, feigning vulnerability.
Sutton’s smirk deepened as he tilted her chin. “Smart girl.”
Swallowing her revulsion, Hailey leaned in, her voice turning honeyed. “Sutton, I’ve missed you.”
With that, she pressed herself against him, subtly reaching for the weapon hidden at her waist.
Pleased by her sudden shift in demeanor, Sutton chuckled smugly and gestured for his men to leave. “All of you, get out. No interruptions until I say so.”
The bodyguards exchanged glances but followed orders, exiting the room.
Outside, they gathered, speaking in hushed tones.
?tst chαpt?rs in glnovels.c?
“What do you think is going on in there?” one of them murmured.
Another smirked. “Isn’t it obvious? Though… isn’t Mr. Wall unable—”
“Keep your voice down! Do you want to get into trouble?”
Though no one said it outright, they all knew Sutton had lost a certain capability.
“Maybe he just enjoys making her dance to his tune, feeding his twisted desires,” one guard chuckled, prompting crude laughter from the others.
Just then, a waiter approached with a tray.
“Gentlemen, the manager has arranged refreshments for you. Please, this way.”
The guards’ eyes lit up.
It seemed their boss wouldn’t be done anytime soon, and they were more than ready for a break.
“Excellent service. Much appreciated!”
They followed the waiter into the next room, oblivious to the scarlet liquid slowly seeping beneath the locked door.
The next morning, at Riverside Villa, Coyle was leisurely enjoying his breakfast when he noticed the butler hesitating to speak. Setting his utensils aside, he frowned.
“Where’s Sutton? Why hasn’t he come down yet?”
Normally, Sutton would have joined him by now, but today, he was absent.
“Sir, Mr. Sutton Wall didn’t return home last night,” the butler replied cautiously.
Coyle’s expression darkened. “Where did that fool run off to this time?”
That bastard had a habit of indulging in reckless behavior instead of handling serious matters.
“Sir, his security team reported that he met with someone from the Burgess Group last night, supposedly to discuss a deal,” the butler hurriedly explained.
Coyle’s irritation faded, replaced by mild amusement. He leaned back with a smirk.
“Well, well. Maybe the boy finally grew a brain. I might’ve underestimated him.”
His mood lifted as he finished breakfast. However, upon arriving at his office, he was met with his assistant, who looked visibly shaken.
“Mr. Wall, bad news!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 722:
Sensing something amiss, Coyle arched a brow.
“What’s with the panic? The world’s still standing, isn’t it?”
With a pale face, the assistant swallowed hard.
“Sir, we received a message from Mr. Noel—he intends to void our contract!”
Coyle’s expression shifted instantly.
“What nonsense are you spouting? Say that again.”
The assistant’s voice trembled as he repeated, “Mr. Noel has officially informed us that the Burgess Group will only work with their chosen partner. Now that our leadership has changed, they see no reason to continue the agreement. They’re sending someone over to finalize the termination, and they’re willing to pay any penalty required. They refuse to proceed.”
At the suburban villa, Noah’s phone buzzed with a call from his assistant, relaying that Coyle was eager to meet.
A cold smirk played on Noah’s lips—it was no surprise. The Burgess Group’s abrupt termination of their partnership must have sent Coyle into a frenzy.
Without hesitation, he rejected the request.
 с?α? ?ν?
“I’m not seeing him.”noveldrama
A brief silence followed before the assistant cautiously inquired, “Mr. Noel, about Ms. Hudson…”
Sadie? What was she up to now?
“What about her?” Noah asked.
The assistant hesitated before stammering, “She… went to a hot spring resort outside the city.”
A hot spring resort?
Noah arched a brow. She certainly knew how to indulge herself. Everything was in place now—all he had to do was watch the situation unfold.
“We’re heading there too. Make the arrangements,” he instructed. With that, he ended the call and leaned back, a calculating gleam in his eyes.
A short while later, Hailey stumbled into the house, looking utterly shaken, her disheveled appearance hinting at a recent ordeal. A faint trace of blood lingered in the air, making Noah’s brows knit together.
The moment she saw him, she rushed forward, clutching onto him as if he were her last hope.
Instinctively, he moved to push her away, but the way her body trembled made him pause.
Instead, he eased her grip and spoke with measured concern.
“Hailey, what happened?”
She didn’t respond, merely shaking her head, her expression vacant—like a marionette whose strings had been severed.
Though irritation flickered in Noah’s eyes, he remained composed and turned to a servant. “Help her clean up and let her rest.”
Without protest, Hailey was led away. Watching her retreating figure, Noah made up his mind to leave as well.
In the bathroom, thick steam curled around Hailey as she soaked in the warm water, her tense muscles slowly loosening. Yet, the memories of the previous night replayed in her mind, vivid and relentless. Sutton’s lifeless body, blood pooling around him, still haunted her thoughts. A shudder ran through her, but she quickly steeled herself.
.

###Chapter 723:
He had only himself to blame. If he hadn’t constantly backed her into a corner, things wouldn’t have escalated to this point. He had it coming.
With Sutton gone, no one could hold anything over her anymore. That alone should have brought her relief.
After bathing, Hailey changed into fresh clothes and stepped out. A carefully arranged meal was waiting, but Noah was absent. She glanced at a servant and casually asked, “Where’s Mr. Noel?”
The servant hesitated before replying, “Ms. Burgess, Mr. Noel left for a suburban hot spring resort. He mentioned he won’t be returning for the next few days.”
Hot spring resort?
Hailey’s eyes narrowed. Why would Noah suddenly decide to go there?
As if recalling something, the servant added, “Oh, and I heard that Ms. Hudson is also at the hot spring resort.”
Sadie!
Hailey’s expression darkened instantly, anger surging within her. She wanted nothing more than to storm off and confront Sadie immediately. But the thought of Sutton’s demise kept her rooted in place. She couldn’t afford reckless actions—not yet. She needed a strategy. Careful planning.
0ff1c1al r3l34s3s 0NL￥ 0n g4ln0v3ls.c0m
Sadie wouldn’t get away with this.
Upon reaching the hot spring resort, Noah was about to enter when he suddenly felt something latch onto his leg. He frowned and looked down. A child was clinging to his leg.
The child looked about six years old, his little face scrunched up, tears streaming down as he sobbed uncontrollably.
“‘Mister, I can’t find my mom,” the little boy whimpered, his voice choked with emotion.
A peculiar sense of familiarity stirred within Noah… which was strange. He was never fond of children—especially not strangers’—but something about this boy unsettled him.
Almost without thinking, he crouched down and lifted the child into his arms. The boy was warm, soft, and carried a faint, innocent scent.
“Take care of the luggage,” Noah instructed his driver, his tone clipped. Then, he prepared to find the child’s mother.
He focused on the child, his voice gentler than before. “What’s your name, kid? Do you know where your parents are?”
Sniffling, the boy replied, “‘I’m Averi Hudson. My mom is Sadie Hudson.”
Noah’s stride faltered, his grip tightening ever so slightly. That name…
It was one he wished he could erase from his thoughts, yet it always found a way back. Inexplicably, he found the name quite distasteful.
But the boy’s next words stopped him cold.
“My dad’s name is Noah Wall.”
Averi wiped at his tear-streaked face and, despite his sniffles, spoke with absolute certainty.
“‘Mommy told me—my dad is Noah Wall.”
Noah felt as though he had been struck by a bolt of electricity, his mind wiped blank. He gawked at the small boy in his arms, utterly stunned.
Averi was angelic, his delicate features carrying a faint resemblance to Noah’s own. This couldn’t be real. A pounding pressure built in Noah’s skull, frustration and disbelief surging through him.
Setting Averi down, Noah leaned against the wall, his expression tense. His temples throbbed intensely, as if his head might burst.

###Chapter 724:
Sensing his unease, Averi tugged at his sleeve, his innocent voice laced with concern. “Sir, are you alright? Do you feel sick?”
Just then, the hum of wheels rolling filled the air. Samuel hurriedly pushed Sadie’s wheelchair toward them.
Minutes ago, Averi had vanished, leaving Sadie in a panic. The tension in her shoulders eased only when she spotted her son, safe and sound.
Seeing his mother, Averi rushed over, his face lighting up with pride.
“Mom, I’m fine. This gentleman brought me inside.”
Sadie’s attention shifted to the man standing nearby. When her gaze landed on Noah’s face, she froze. What on earth was he doing here?
At the thought that they weren’t far from her room, Sadie quickly composed herself and instructed Samuel, “Samuel, take Mr. Noel to Room 302 and call a doctor.”
Without hesitation, Samuel supported Noah and led him away. Sadie followed shortly after, maneuvering her wheelchair while guiding Averi back to their suite.
The doctor performed a quick assessment before stepping aside. “Mr. Noel is experiencing symptoms of memory loss. Did he sustain a serious head injury in the past?”
Sadie’s breath hitched, but she nodded. The memories—ones she tried to bury—were inescapable.

The doctor acknowledged her response, prescribed medication, and advised, “He should get plenty of rest and avoid emotional strain.”
“Understood. Thank you,” she replied.
Just as the doctor turned to leave, she couldn’t help asking, “Is there a possibility his memory could return?”
The doctor’s expression grew uncertain. “I can’t say for sure. Neurology isn’t my specialty. Consulting a specialist would be best.”
Sadie’s eyes dimmed slightly, but she offered a polite nod. “I appreciate your help.”noveldrama
After Samuel escorted the doctor out, silence settled over the room. Sadie attempted to stand, her back wounds aching as she steadied herself against the wall. Slowly, she made her way toward the bedroom.
Noah lay motionless on the bed, his silver mask reflecting the soft glow of moonlight.
Hesitating briefly, Sadie reached forward, her fingers brushing the cool surface as she carefully removed it.
As the mask slipped away, she found herself staring at a face she had known all too well. Three years had passed. Countless nights, this very image had haunted her dreams—clear yet distant.
Now, with him right in front of her, reality felt almost surreal.
Her chest tightened.
Eyes brimming with emotion, she lifted a trembling hand, compelled to touch the familiar contours of Noah’s face. But before she could, Noah’s eyes snapped open.
His gaze was sharp, filled with reflexive suspicion.
In an instant, he seized her wrist and, with swift force, flipped her beneath him.
A sharp gasp escaped her lips as pain flared from her back.
“Ouch!” She whimpered in pain.
Realizing who he had pinned down, Noah stilled. The wariness in his expression faded, replaced by something softer—concern.
.

###Chapter 725:
He quickly released Sadie, propping himself up and helping her sit.
“Are you alright?”
His voice carried an edge of worry, though he seemed unaware of it.
Sadie inhaled sharply, rubbing her sore back. Her tears had yet to dry, and she wiped them away before meeting Noah’s gaze. Her voice remained steady, though distant. “Mr. Noel, what brings you here?”
Noah hesitated, unable to answer. His assistant had mentioned Sadie’s presence at the hot spring resort, and before he knew it, he had followed an inexplicable urge to come. It was as though something beyond his control had drawn him here. But he wasn’t about to admit that. His tone remained detached. “Just here for a break. You’re reading too much into it, Ms. Hudson.”noveldrama
Sadie gave a slight nod, not pressing further. “If that’s the case, now that you’re awake, please leave. This is my room.” Her words were polite but impersonal, as though she was addressing a stranger.
Something inside Noah twisted. A strange, unexplainable irritation crept in. She was in such a hurry to send him away?
“Apologies for the intrusion,” he said coolly, rising from the bed. Without another word, he turned toward the door.
In the living room, Averi remained engrossed in his toys. When Noah emerged, the boy’s face lit up with a bright, innocent smile. His eyes curved in a way that sent an eerie sense of familiarity through Noah’s chest.
g?lnσνs?c?m is packed with great reads
He halted mid-step. That strange feeling gripped him once again—something he couldn’t quite name. But before he could dwell on it, he shook the thought away and left, his steps surprisingly unsteady.
Noah’s driver had already moved the suitcases into his room. Noticing Noah’s uneasy look, he felt perplexed but opted to keep quiet, refraining from asking questions. Noah stepped into his room, shutting the door behind him. He retrieved his phone and dialed his assistant. “I need details on Sadie’s son, Averi.”
On the other end, though momentarily puzzled, the assistant promptly responded, “Understood, Mr. Noel. I’ll get on it right away.”
Meanwhile, Sadie sat motionless in her suite at the hot spring resort. Since Noah was here, that meant her strategy at the company must already be in motion. Suddenly, her phone rang—it was Blaine. She answered, and his voice came through with a teasing lilt. “How’s the hot spring? Relaxing, I hope?”
As usual, Blaine started with a lighthearted remark. Sadie’s lips curled slightly, her tone neutral. “It’s fine.”
“Judging by your response, it doesn’t sound too impressive,” Blaine sighed dramatically before shifting the conversation, his voice brimming with intrigue. “But, you know, things at the company are getting quite interesting.”
A flicker of emotion stirred within Sadie, though she remained composed. “What’s happening?”
Blaine said, his tone carrying a hint of mischief, “That old fox, Coyle, is in serious trouble this time.”
Sadie had anticipated this outcome, so the news didn’t shock her. Maintaining her usual composure, she replied, “Give me the specifics.”
“Mr. Noel made it clear he has no intention of continuing their deal,” Blaine said, amusement lacing his words. “He didn’t even grant them a meeting—just terminated the contract without hesitation. This morning, Coyle’s office was a complete madhouse. Malcolm and the other shareholders wasted no time rushing over to ‘express their concerns’ once they learned Burgess Group was pulling out.” Blaine vividly recounted Coyle’s predicament, his tone gleeful.
.
.
.
###Chapter 726:
Listening to him, Sadie couldn’t help but smirk. Coyle had this coming.
“Oh, there’s something even more intriguing,” Blaine added, pausing as if savoring the moment. His tone turned cryptic.
“What is it?” Sadie asked.
“Sutton has vanished,” he said in a hushed voice, tinged with curiosity. “Early this morning, Coyle’s men were scouring everywhere, but they’ve found no trace of him.”
This revelation caught Sadie off guard. Sutton was missing? What was going on?
A flicker of confusion crossed her features as her brows knitted together. “Vanished?”
“Completely,” Blaine confirmed. “Not a single lead on where he went. Nobody can figure out how he managed to disappear without a trace.” His voice carried a note of inquiry, making it clear that Sutton’s sudden absence had left him equally perplexed.
Sadie remained quiet, her thoughts racing. Who was responsible for this? And why?
Blaine chuckled. “Coyle must be losing his mind right now. The company is falling apart, and his son is nowhere to be found. He’s probably tearing through the office in a fit of rage.”
Despite the situation, Sadie felt no real sense of satisfaction. Something about Sutton’s disappearance unsettled her.
   ? at ?ν．
“Enough of these serious matters,” Blaine said, changing the subject with a playful tone. “Enjoy your stay at the hot spring. I’ll take care of things here. Don’t worry, everything is under control.”
“Appreciate it,” Sadie said quietly.
“No need for formalities with me,” Blaine chuckled. “Take it easy. Talk later.”
As the call ended, Tina knocked on the door before stepping inside.
“Mr. Castro, Coyle has requested to see you.”
Blaine adjusted his attire and made his way to the chairman’s office. The moment he arrived, Coyle greeted him with exaggerated warmth, his expression overly eager.noveldrama
“Blaine! Glad you came. Please, have a seat,” Coyle said, pouring a cup of coffee with great enthusiasm.
Blaine, uninterested in small talk, got straight to the point. “Mr. Wall, what do you need?”
He leaned back, crossing his legs casually, exuding indifference.
Coyle’s smile stiffened momentarily. However, needing Blaine’s cooperation, he forced himself to maintain composure. Clasping his hands together, he let out a strained chuckle. “Blaine, our company is experiencing a bit of difficulty, and I was hoping you could lend a hand.”
“Lend a hand?” Blaine arched an eyebrow, his voice laced with amusement. “You’re referring to Burgess Group abruptly canceling the partnership, aren’t you?”
Coyle’s face grew tense. He hadn’t expected Blaine to be so blunt.
“Yes, exactly,” he admitted reluctantly. “That partnership was essential to us, and now the entire company is in turmoil.”
He paused for a moment before continuing, “After considering the situation, I believe only Sadie has the ability to resolve this mess.”
“Mr. Wall, have you forgotten that you were the one who personally and publicly dismissed Ms. Hudson?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 727:
Blaine’s words struck Coyle where it hurt the most. His already forced smile almost faltered.
Asking Sadie to come back? No way! That woman was far too cunning for comfort. If she regained any semblance of control, Coyle doubted he and his family would have any peaceful days ahead.
Given the circumstances, however, it seemed that their only viable option was to use Sadie to maintain the partnership with the Burgess Group, if only temporarily. But at the same time, it was crucial that Coyle still kept his position as chairman. He understood his priorities.
Swallowing his displeasure, he widened the fake smile on his face. “Now, Blaine, be careful with how you phrase things. What happened back then was just a misunderstanding.”
Blaine raised an eyebrow, his lips still curled into a faint smirk. He gave Coyle a sardonic look but said nothing else.
Coyle bristled under his gaze, and had to clear his throat twice before speaking again. “In any case, Sadie is still part of the Wall family. She couldn’t possibly just stand by and do nothing while the Wall Group descends into chaos.”
He paused, his tone taking on a subtle, underlying threat. “Other than that, your family also has stakes in the company’s fate. If the deal with the Burgess Group falls through, your family would suffer the repercussions as well, wouldn’t you agree?”
F0r full ch@pters, g0 to glnovels.
Blaine almost burst out laughing at that. The old bastard was actually trying to use his family’s benefits to pressure him now? How absurd!
Blaine pretended to give it some serious thought, then he nodded. “You make a valid point. We are all in this together. Bringing Sadie back wouldn’t be impossible for me, but there is the matter of payment…”
He trailed off meaningfully.
Coyle understood, of course. Much like Sadie, Blaine wouldn’t lift a finger without the promise of a reward.
Coyle wanted to curse at the young man, but he kept his rants to himself. With obvious reluctance, he produced a black card from his suit jacket and handed it over. “Consider this a small token of appreciation. Once you complete your task, you will have a more generous reward.”
Blaine’s eyes lit up as he plucked the card without a second’s hesitation. He flipped it between his fingers, his smile turning more genuine. “Rest assured, Mr. Wall. You can leave this matter to me. I’ll handle it.”
With that, he stood up and sauntered out of the office with a wave of his hand.noveldrama
As soon as the door clicked shut, Coyle dropped his smile. His expression turned dark with barely contained fury. He kicked the coffee table in frustration, causing a dull thud to reverberate around the room.
The table didn’t move an inch, but his foot was throbbing with pain. Coyle grimaced and clutched the toe of his shoe, his rage flaring up even further.
“That damn brat! How dare he extort me!” he growled, his chest heaving as he tried to catch his breath. The way Coyle saw it, Ralph’s influence had emboldened Blaine to the point of disrespect. And that wretched Sadie! Once he dealt with the current obstacles, he would make sure those two were dispatched as well!
Coyle grabbed the landline and called his assistant. “Have you found Sutton yet?”
The other man’s voice was trembling with trepidation. “Not yet, Sir.”
Coyle’s anger surged again. “Useless! All of you are just a bunch of useless fools! You can’t even find one person? Are you all completely incompetent? I don’t care what it takes—find him!”

###Chapter 728:
He was all but roaring through the phone, and he slammed it down on the receiver before the poor assistant could respond.
That reckless son of his was another headache!noveldrama
Coyle had sent Sutton to discuss the collaboration with the Burgess Group last night. Heaven only knew what sort of mess Sutton had ended up causing.
Patrick had called this morning to cancel the deal outright.
Coyle was certain Sutton had done something to upset him the previous night!
The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, until the veins on his temples were bulging.
Just then, his personal phone rang. Coyle glanced at the caller ID and forced himself to calm down. He cleared his throat, picked up the phone, and changed his tone to one of humility and respect.
“Hello, Malcolm. Please don’t worry. I can explain. The situation with the Burgess Group is just a minor setback—a small misunderstanding. I assure you that the deal will not fall through. I’m already handling it. We will have results soon.”
Coyle reassured the senior shareholder as calmly as he could, his demeanor shifting from the outraged man moments ago to someone trying to maintain control of the situation.
Meanwhile, Blaine was humming a tune as he walked toward the entrance of the Wall Group building, feeling quite pleased with himself. He was crossing the lobby when he spotted Tina at the front desk, turning over some documents to the receptionist.
?: g?ν?
Blaine brightened. He walked over and grabbed her wrist without a word, pulling her outside.
Before Tina knew it, she had been shoved into the passenger seat of a sports car. She could only blink at the street view they were speeding past.
“Where are you taking me, Mr. Castro?” she asked, her voice filled with confusion.
Instead of answering her question, Blaine casually tossed Coyle’s black card onto her lap. “Your salary.”
Tina’s eyes widened in disbelief. What was going on?
She reached over for the steering wheel, saying, “Mr. Castro, please stop the car. I still have work to do.”
Blaine easily dodged Tina’s hand, amusement dancing in his voice. “Right now, our priority should be locating Ms. Hudson,” he remarked lightly.
He paused briefly before adding with playful dismissiveness, “The company’s mess? Let’s generously leave that headache to Coyle.”
Tina blinked, momentarily speechless. They were looking for Sadie? She wasn’t sure about Blaine’s full intentions, but she trusted Sadie implicitly. If they were seeking her out, it had to be something crucial. She quieted down, no longer protesting.
At the hot spring resort, beside the open-air bath, Sadie reclined comfortably in her wheelchair, holding a tiny water gun as she enjoyed precious moments with Averi. Golden rays from the afternoon sun wrapped around them, creating an atmosphere of pure relaxation.
Averi squealed in delight, his youthful face sparkling with droplets of water, thoroughly absorbed in the fun.
“Sadie!” A voice she knew well rang clearly through the air.
She lifted her eyes to find Blaine and Tina approaching. What brought them here?

###Chapter 729:
Apparently, Coyle couldn’t hold on any longer. Perfect timing—her plan was already halfway there. Sadie’s lips curled into a deeper, more satisfied smile.
She glanced sideways at Samuel, who stood dutifully beside her. “Samuel, please escort Mr. Castro and Tina to the reception and ensure they’re comfortably settled.”
Samuel nodded respectfully. “Of course, Ms. Hudson.”
As they departed, Blaine cast Sadie a swift, reassuring wink—a silent promise that he had everything under control. Sadie shook her head with an amused smile.noveldrama
She turned back, her gaze drifting upward to the balcony above, where she caught sight of a tall figure outlined against the sun.
Noah stood casually, leaning against the railing, a silver mask obscuring part of his expression. His gaze rested solely on her.
Their eyes locked, and Sadie’s pulse quickened in surprise.
How long had he been watching?
Noah descended slowly, approaching her with an inscrutable smile that played lightly at the corners of his mouth.
Discover new chapters at ον?s.
“It appears your scheme is unfolding rather smoothly,” he remarked, his voice subtly tinged with teasing amusement.
Sadie’s heart skipped gently.
Their eyes held, and Sadie remembered something crucial. Her expression sobered as she asked directly, “Does Sutton’s disappearance have anything to do with you?”
Noah raised an eyebrow, visibly caught off guard by her suspicion. After a brief pause, he chuckled softly, his voice edged with gentle irony. “Why would I bother with someone like him?”
Sadie’s brow furrowed in thoughtful confusion.
If it wasn’t Noah… and she certainly hadn’t orchestrated it either… then what exactly had happened to Sutton? Could Coyle be responsible? A shadow of unease stirred in her chest.
At that very moment, Averi, who had been absorbed in his playful antics, suddenly bounded over and grasped Noah’s pant leg tightly, his wide, innocent eyes sparkling.
“Sir, will you come play water guns with me?”
Noah lowered his gaze, looking at Averi’s earnest face. A subtle yet undeniable warmth tugged at him again—this child stirred something strangely familiar deep inside.
He hesitated but then found himself nodding without conscious thought.
“Alright,” he said gently.
Averi let out a joyful cheer, immediately tugging Noah enthusiastically toward the hot spring.
“Hurry,” Averi urged eagerly.
Noah stumbled lightly but held Averi’s hand securely, letting himself be guided forward.
Soon, the two were splashing freely in the water, laughter bubbling brightly between them.
Sadie observed their carefree interaction, her expression softening yet deeply thoughtful.

Just then, Samuel quietly returned to her side.
“Ms. Hudson, everything’s arranged. Mr. Castro and Tina have settled comfortably.”
Sadie nodded lightly, reluctantly pulling her eyes from Noah and Averi’s carefree scene back to Samuel.
She lowered her voice, her expression solemn. “I need you to quietly look into Sutton’s disappearance.”
This didn’t bear the hallmarks of Coyle’s methods; Sutton’s sudden absence felt too peculiar. She wasn’t particularly worried for Sutton himself, but Coyle and his family were too scheming. Better safe than sorry.
Samuel immediately caught her drift. “Consider it done, Ms. Hudson.”
He turned swiftly to leave but hesitated after a few steps, remembering another matter.
“Oh, and Mr. Castro mentioned he’s planning a barbecue tonight at the resort’s outdoor area. He asked if you’d care to join him.”
At the word “barbecue,” Averi’s ears perked up instantly. Abandoning the water gun mid-game, he dashed over and wrapped his small arms around Sadie’s arm, peering up eagerly through his water-slicked bangs.

“Mommy, barbecue! I want barbecue, please!”
Sadie laughed softly, affectionately tousling his damp hair. Almost instinctively, her gaze wandered to Noah, who had already paused his game, apparently overhearing Averi’s enthusiastic pleas. Though the mask concealed his features, Sadie sensed his curious gaze lingering on her, as if he was awaiting her decision.
Before she could reply, Noah took a step toward her, his rich voice playfully smooth, carrying a subtle, inviting undertone. “Why not? It sounds enjoyable—the more, the merrier.”noveldrama
Noah, to everyone’s surprise, had no ions to participating in the group activity. Perhaps the memory loss had altered his disposition. Sadie pushed aside her thoughts and simply nodded. Averi instantly lit up. “Yes! Time for barbecue!”
That evening, the resort’s outdoor grilling area glowed under bright lights. The air was filled with the enticing scent of sizzling meat. Sadie sat in her wheelchair, with the ever-energetic Averi by her side. Across from them, Blaine and Tina focused on flipping the skewers over the fire. Isabel, valuing her peace and quiet at this stage in life, had retired to her room early.
Blaine grabbed a skewer of grilled chicken wings, handed it to Averi, and took a long drink from his beer bottle. “Didn’t expect to see everyone here,” he commented, his eyes eventually settling on Noah—more specifically, on the silver mask covering his face.
“Hey, Mr. Noel, it’s not often we get a chance to unwind. Doesn’t that mask get annoying?” Blaine teased. “Why not take it off? We’re all familiar faces.” He smirked, dragging out his words. “Or are you hiding something?”
His remark was direct. Sadie’s chest tightened. She shot Blaine a sharp look, silently signaling him to drop it. “Mr. Noel just prefers to keep a low profile—unlike you, always demanding attention,” she said coolly.
Before Blaine could respond, Tina snatched a freshly grilled beef skewer and shoved it into his mouth. “Just eat! Why do you talk so much?” Blaine, mouth full, mumbled something incoherent but didn’t take offense.
Laughter rippled through the group, restoring the lighthearted atmosphere.
As everyone laughed and enjoyed the rare moment of leisure, Blaine’s phone rang on the table. The name “Coyle” flashed on the screen. Blaine arched an eyebrow, amusement flickering in his gaze. That cunning old fox was certainly impatient. Casually, he picked up the call, pressed the speaker button, and leaned back.

###Chapter 731:
“Hello? Who’s this?” Blaine asked, feigning ignorance.
On the other end, Coyle’s voice carried a cautious yet overly polite tone. “Blaine, it’s me, Coyle. I hope I’m not disturbing you?”
Blaine chuckled. “Oh, Mr. Wall. What’s up?”
Coyle hesitated before speaking again, his tone even more deferential. “I wanted to ask if you’ve seen Sadie. Has she agreed to return to the company?”noveldrama
Feigning realization, Blaine dramatically slapped his forehead. “Oh! That totally slipped my mind, Mr. Wall! I got so caught up in the fun today that I haven’t gotten around to it.” He paused before adding dismissively, “Tell you what, I’ll make sure to ask her tomorrow. Hello? Hello? Mr. Wall? The reception here is terrible—I can barely hear you. Let’s chat later!”
Without waiting for a reply, Blaine promptly ended the call. With swift precision, he blocked the number and powered off his phone in one smooth motion.
The group watched him, each reacting differently. Sadie sighed, shaking her head. Blaine was getting craftier by the day. Tina barely held back her laughter. Noah, still masked, remained unreadable, though his grip on the wine glass stilled briefly.
Meanwhile, in the chairman’s office at Wall Group, Coyle stared at his phone in disbelief. Terrible reception? No—Blaine had intentionally hung up on him.
Coyle dialed again, unwilling to give up. “Sorry, the number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable…” The robotic voice only confirmed what he dreaded. Even a fool would understand now. He’d been played! That little punk had deceived him—and taken his black card in the process!
Your next chapter awaits g?lnσνls?c?m
“Damn it!” Coyle’s fury exploded. His forehead veins bulged as he hurled his phone against the wall, shattering it into pieces. “Blaine! Sadie! Just wait and see!” he roared, pacing the room in frustration.
With the partnership with Burgess Group in jeopardy, Sutton missing, and now Blaine making a fool of him, things were spiraling out of control.
Just then, the office door burst open. His assistant stumbled in, face drained of color, panting heavily.
“Sir—sir! There’s trouble!”
Coyle, still fuming, glared at him. “What now? Has the world ended?”
The assistant swallowed nervously, his voice shaking. “The shareholders—they’re back! They’re demanding an immediate solution for the deal with Burgess Group, or they’ll start selling off their stakes! They’re all waiting in the conference room!”
Coyle swallowed his rage, tugged sharply at his tie, and strode purposefully toward the conference room. Even before reaching the entrance, he heard the agitated voices spilling from inside.
Pushing open the heavy door, he stepped into pure chaos. Clusters of shareholders argued animatedly, faces twisted with dissatisfaction, complaints rising louder by the second.
“Coyle is dragging the Wall Group straight into ruin!”
“Precisely! Did we ever face such disasters when Ms. Hudson was in charge?”
“He single-handedly botched the deal with Burgess Group—how can someone like him still be the chairman?”
“Sadie could do a far better job than this!”
These people, who once bowed respectfully at every word Coyle uttered, were now openly casting blame the moment trouble arose.
With a stormy expression, Coyle marched to the head of the table and slammed his palm down sharply, commanding the room.

###Chapter 732:
“That’s enough!”
A stunned silence immediately filled the air.
Coyle forced a strained smile, struggling to maintain a composed voice. “Please, everyone, let’s remain calm. I’m already handling the situation personally. All I ask for is a little patience.”
The moment he finished, Malcolm, seated just to his left, let out a disdainful snort and rose abruptly.
“Handling it, Mr. Wall?” Malcolm mocked coldly. “Last I checked, Mr. Noel from Burgess Group won’t even return your calls.”
Coyle’s smile froze stiffly on his face.
Malcolm glared openly at Coyle’s silent embarrassment, his tone uncompromising. “Let me be blunt: if the deal with Burgess Group isn’t rescued within two days, I’ll dump every single share I hold. I’d rather take my money elsewhere than watch it vanish in this sinking ship!”
With a sharp turn, Malcolm stormed from the room.
The remaining shareholders exchanged uncertain glances. Gradually, they began rising as well.noveldrama
“Malcolm has a point, Mr. Wall. Pull yourself together,” one shareholder said pointedly. “Two days—no satisfactory results, and we’ll also be selling our shares.”
 : ?ν.?
One by one, the shareholders filed out, leaving Coyle alone in suffocating silence. His chest rose and fell heavily with rage, a dark shadow passing over his face. These scheming, traitorous old foxes were cornering him!
Unable to contain his fury, he violently swung out an arm, toppling the chair in front of him with a loud crash.
Patrick! The Burgess Group! Sadie! Blaine! And now these faithless, backstabbing shareholders!
He refused—utterly refused—to accept defeat! Was the Wall Group so fragile that losing the partnership with Burgess Group alone would doom it entirely? With countless projects in the pipeline, surely there had to be another opportunity he could seize!
Coyle paced anxiously, thoughts spinning furiously. Suddenly, his memory sparked.
The New Rise Corporation—part of the influential Howe Group—had just started an ambitious new energy project and was currently inviting bids.
A fire ignited in his eyes. If he secured that deal, it would not only offset the current loss, but also pave the way to building ties with the powerful Howe family. Determined, Coyle quickly made a call.
“Bring Briley to me. Immediately.”
“Right away, Mr. Wall.”
After a brief moment, Briley stepped into the room, looking tired and downcast.
“You called, Dad?” she asked quietly.
Seeing his daughter’s dispirited state, Coyle felt a flicker of irritation. But given the critical nature of his next step, he softened his voice deliberately.
“How are things progressing between you and Alex?”
Briley immediately dropped her gaze, her voice carrying a trace of bitterness.
“‘Dad, just forget about him. Ever since that night, he’s been avoiding me completely. I haven’t even been able to get close,” Briley murmured unhappily.
That night? Coyle’s eyes sharpened immediately.
.

###Chapter 733:
“‘Did something happen between you two?”
Briley’s face grew warm, her voice dropping to a whisper, filled with awkwardness.
“‘At a party, he drank a bit too much, and we ended up…’” She trailed off, her silence heavy with meaning.
For a brief moment, shock crossed Coyle’s features, quickly replaced by unrestrained delight. This was exactly the opportunity he’d been waiting for!
Careful to conceal his eagerness, he composed himself, adopting a gentle, understanding expression. If Briley were to become pregnant with Alex’s child, the proud Howe family—no matter how reluctant—would be forced into a marriage alliance to protect their lineage and dignity.
With the Howes as in-laws, who would dare challenge the Wall Group then?noveldrama
Briley noticed the shifting emotions on her father’s face, anxiety stirring within her as she quickly understood exactly what he was planning.
“‘Dad, you’re not thinking about…” Briley spoke hesitantly.
Coyle met his daughter’s gaze, finally abandoning any pretense. Leaning forward, he spoke quietly yet firmly.

“Briley, we have no choice. This is our last chance. Think carefully—without support from the Howe family, how long can the Wall Group hold out, especially now? It’s only a matter of time before Sadie crushes us completely!”
Briley’s face paled at the thought. She was a Wall—why should an outsider like Sadie overshadow her?
“‘But… Dad, what if everything backfires? Alex doesn’t even like me. If he realizes I’ve schemed against him…”
She trailed off, dread pooling in her heart at the thought of consequences.
Noticing her wavering resolve, Coyle pressed harder, his tone unyielding.
“‘We must risk it all this time! Success or ruin—it hinges entirely on this. Once you’re pregnant, even if the Howe family despises it, they’ll be forced to accept you as Alex’s wife. Don’t you see? You could marry into one of the most powerful families!”
His words resonated deeply within Briley, slowly igniting determination. If she married someone as influential and unattainable as Alex, wouldn’t her status rise above everyone else’s?
After a tense pause, Briley finally lifted her chin, her eyes filled with newfound resolve. “Alright, Dad. I’ll follow your plan.”
“That’s my girl!” Coyle praised her, placing a firm hand on her shoulder, his eyes glinting with cold calculation.
Early the next morning, Coyle convened an emergency shareholders’ meeting. Despite their growing dissatisfaction, the shareholders reluctantly gathered once more, driven mainly by curiosity to see what new strategy Coyle had concocted.
They sat stiffly around the table, their faces weary from a sleepless night, each expression wary and unsettled. Coyle took his place at the head of the table, radiating an unmistakable confidence—a stark contrast to his desperation just the day before.
“Everyone,” he said steadily. “I know you’re deeply concerned about our lost partnership with the Burgess Group.” He paused for effect, allowing everyone’s unease to simmer briefly. “But when one door closes, another always opens. I’m pleased to announce that I’ve arranged for us to collaborate with New Rise Corporation instead.”
Coyle paused dramatically, scanning the room in anticipation, hoping his news would spark some enthusiasm among the shareholders. Instead, he was met with a wall of icy skepticism.
.
.
.
###Chapter 734:
They regarded him warily, silently questioning what trickery Coyle was attempting this time. Aside from the deal with Burgess Group, what other deals could even begin to cover the huge gap left behind?
Clearing his throat sharply, Coyle pressed on. “I’ve already initiated talks with New Rise Corporation. Their new energy initiative holds immense promise. Once we clinch this project, our crisis will naturally resolve itself.”
His declaration drew confused murmurs among the shareholders, their skeptical whispers rising audibly.
“‘New Rise Corporation? I’ve heard of that project—it’s hardly significant!'”noveldrama
“‘Exactly! That project’s nothing but small potatoes. How could it possibly fill the void our lost deal left?'”
“‘Are you just trying to fool us, Mr. Wall?'”
As their doubts intensified into open accusations, Coyle’s forced smile crumbled entirely. His patience snapped, and he slammed his palm sharply onto the table, the sound echoing through the room.
Instantly, silence engulfed the conference room.
Coyle’s face turned grim, his gaze icy and cutting as he swept it across the shareholders.
Find your imagination at galn ovels ; con
A room full of narrow-minded fools! All they saw were immediate losses—they couldn’t fathom the bigger picture!
New Rise Corporation might seem small, but behind it stood the mighty Howe family! With the Howe family’s backing, what opportunities couldn’t the Wall Group seize?
Suppressing his anger, Coyle curled his lips into a cold smile.
“I admit, compared to Burgess Group’s project, New Rise’s might seem insignificant,” he said deliberately, watching as the shareholders’ curiosity sharpened, their ears pricking up eagerly. “But what if my family is soon to be bound to the Howe family by marriage?”
Shock instantly rippled across the room.
“Marriage?”
An alliance—between Coyle’s family and the Howes?
Stunned silence fell heavily, eyes widening in disbelief. The Howe family’s current prestige was practically equal to that of the Wall family. A marriage alliance between the two would instantly neutralize Wall Group’s crisis.
Witnessing the shareholders’ stunned disbelief, Coyle felt a surge of satisfaction.
“My daughter Briley and Alex Howe, the president of the Howe Group, have fallen deeply in love and will soon be married,” he said confidently. “Rest assured, everyone—the Wall Group has a bright and secure future ahead.”
Casting a disdainful glance at the previously aggressive shareholders, he snorted quietly to himself. Once this alliance was solidified, these short-sighted troublemakers would be the first he’d take care of!
Thoroughly enjoying their shocked silence, Coyle straightened the cuffs of his suit jacket, turned around, and arrogantly strode out of the conference room without another glance.
His assistant stood waiting anxiously in the hallway. “Mr. Wall.” Without slowing his pace, Coyle headed directly to the elevator. “Get the car ready. I’m heading to the Howe family’s residence.” He intended to visit his future in-laws personally.
The assistant quickly followed.
The car glided smoothly down the street. In the back seat, Coyle leaned back comfortably, shutting his eyes to savor the moment.

###Chapter 735:
The driver hesitated slightly before handing over a document folder. “Mr. Wall, here’s the paperwork you requested.”
Coyle opened his eyes, accepted the folder, and pulled out a neatly printed pregnancy report. He scanned it carefully. The report clearly indicated that Briley was over six weeks pregnant.
The smile on his face widened in triumph. Now that he was armed with this report, the Howe family wouldn’t dare deny responsibility!
Tucking the document securely into his jacket’s inner pocket, Coyle relaxed back into his seat, assured of victory. This was his ultimate bargaining chip.
They soon arrived at the Howe family’s villa. The car glided to a halt, and Coyle straightened his suit, stepping out with unshakeable confidence. He approached the door and pressed the bell.
Moments later, a well-dressed butler answered, eyeing him politely.
“May I ask who you are?”
Coyle lifted his chin slightly, his voice dripping with arrogance. “I’m Coyle Wall of Wall Group, here to meet Mr. Alex Howe.”
Every story starts at galn ovels ; com
The butler politely but firmly assessed him. “I’m sorry, Mr. Wall, but Mr. Howe isn’t receiving guests today. If you have an appointment—”
Coyle harshly interrupted him, irritation flaring instantly. “Enough nonsense!”
A mere servant had the nerve to stop him? Once Briley married into this family, the first person he’d remove would be this insolent butler.
With a disdainful smirk, Coyle pulled the pregnancy report from his pocket and threw it contemptuously at the butler’s feet. “Take a good look. My daughter is pregnant with Alex’s child! Inform him immediately!”
The butler’s expression shifted visibly as his eyes landed on the report. Realizing the sensitivity of the situation, he quickly picked up the papers, concern crossing his usually composed features.
“Mr. Wall, please wait here for a moment,” the butler said politely, guiding Coyle to wait in the garden before quickly heading into the main building.
Upstairs in the study, Alex sat behind his desk, immersed in documents, not bothering to look up when a knock sounded at the door.
“Enter,” he said calmly.
The butler stepped inside, his expression unusually grave. “Mr. Howe, Mr. Coyle Wall from Wall Group is waiting outside.”
Alex immediately frowned. Coyle Wall? What business could he possibly have here? The Howe family had never had dealings with him.
Alex waved his hand dismissively, turning back to his paperwork. “I don’t want to see him.”
The butler hesitated briefly before carefully handing over the report he was holding. “Mr. Howe, perhaps you should take a look at this first.”
Alex paused, mildly annoyed, then accepted the document. He glanced down at it indifferently.
Briley was pregnant?
Indeed, one night, he’d somehow ended up sleeping with a drunken Briley, but he’d immediately sent someone afterward to give her emergency contraception. How could she have gotten pregnant?
Disgust twisted sharply in his chest.
With icy disdain, Alex tossed the report carelessly onto his desk. “Send Coyle away—now!”noveldrama
The butler stood momentarily frozen, visibly startled.
.

.
###Chapter 736:
“But Mr. Howe…”
Alex sharply lifted his gaze, eyes fierce and commanding. “Was I unclear?”
The butler immediately lowered his head, heart pounding nervously. “No, Sir, I’ll take care of it immediately.”
Alex then issued another firm command. “Also—send someone to ‘invite’ Briley here. Immediately.”
He intended to question her personally and find out exactly what kind of game she thought she was playing.
“Understood,” the butler replied swiftly, hurrying to carry out Alex’s orders.
Meanwhile, in the garden, Coyle reclined leisurely, savoring his coffee with supreme confidence. With Briley carrying the Howe family’s heir, perhaps Terrance himself would eagerly hand over the New Rise Corporation’s project to Wall Group.
The mere thought broadened Coyle’s smile into smug satisfaction. His daydream was abruptly shattered by the sudden sound of heavy footsteps.
Several towering bodyguards approached, their expressions stern and unyielding.
Surprised, Coyle quickly set down his cup. Were they finally going to let him inside?
 ? : ﹒
As he stood to greet them, two bodyguards roughly seized him by each arm and began forcibly dragging him toward the gates.
“Hey! What are you doing?” he roared, disbelief and fury overtaking him as he thrashed wildly. “Let go! I’m the grandfather of Alex’s child! How dare you treat me this way? Where’s Alex? Tell him to come out and face me!”
His enraged shouts echoed through the garden until one irritated bodyguard produced a cloth and stuffed it firmly into Coyle’s mouth, abruptly silencing his protests.
Coyle’s eyes widened in disbelief as he struggled furiously, but his resistance was futile. He was hauled mercilessly out of the Howe family’s villa and flung onto the pavement like discarded trash.
Bang!
The heavy iron gates slammed shut.
Coyle lay sprawled on the ground, the cloth falling from his mouth. He coughed violently, staring with humiliated fury at the now-closed gates, his entire body shaking with rage, his face scarlet with shame.
This was a humiliation—a huge one!
How dare Alex and the Howe family humiliate him like this!
Rising unsteadily to his feet, he angrily dusted off his clothes, venom burning in his narrowed eyes as he swore revenge.
From a discreet black car parked nearby, someone carefully recorded the entire humiliating episode. The person smiled coldly while observing Coyle’s retreating figure, filled with bitterness and anger. Silently, the car started, quietly following behind Coyle.
Meanwhile, in the serene hot spring resort, Sadie had just returned to her room after an enjoyable afternoon playing in the water with Averi.
Samuel approached, discreetly handing her a phone. “Ms. Hudson, some new information just came in,” he said quietly.
Curious, Sadie opened the message to find a video along with a brief summary of events.
.
.noveldrama
.
###Chapter 737:noveldrama
The footage clearly showed Coyle being dragged from the Howe family’s residence and tossed unceremoniously onto the ground. “Coyle attempted to secure a marriage alliance by using Briley’s pregnancy report. Alex rejected him and had him thrown out.”
Sadie’s eyebrows knitted together thoughtfully. Coyle actually had the audacity to provoke Alex? Clearly, he was desperate now. But… Briley was pregnant?
She frowned. How could this be? Alex was known to be sharp and cautious; how could someone of his caliber fall prey to such petty tricks? The whole affair seemed highly suspicious.
At that moment, Noah appeared quietly beside her. His gaze fell on Sadie’s phone screen, which displayed the message and video that had just been received.
Sadie felt a subtle warmth brush against her senses—the faint scent of cedar and something refreshingly clean and masculine. She tensed slightly, instinctively aware of Noah’s close proximity. A faint shiver raced up her spine.
Noah was standing a little too close for comfort. His gaze lingered on the screen, his eyes narrowing slightly beneath the mask as an almost imperceptible smirk touched his lips.
Coyle’s scheme was certainly bold, but hopelessly wrong. He glanced at the video, a peculiar satisfaction surfacing. Yet, the moment his eyes drifted back to Sadie, his pleasure vanished. Her brow was delicately furrowed, her usually serene face clouded with complicated emotions. She was lost deep in thought.
See more chapters at gl no vels.
An uncomfortable tightness crept into Noah’s chest again. He leaned slightly closer, his voice dipping into a playful, teasing murmur near her ear. “Ms. Hudson, don’t tell me you’re feeling jealous?”
Caught off guard, Sadie swiftly tucked the phone away, her cheeks flushing slightly. She lifted her chin to meet his penetrating gaze—eyes sharp even behind his mask—and countered, a faint irritation coloring her voice. “When did prying into others’ personal affairs become a hobby of yours, Mr. Noel?”
Noah raised an amused eyebrow, neither admitting nor denying her accusation. Unwilling to dwell further on such dangerous territory, Sadie decisively changed the subject.
“At this moment, Coyle is cornered by the Burgess Group and desperately seeking a lifeline through New Rise Corporation,” Sadie explained evenly. “It’s no secret that New Rise belongs to the Howe family.” She paused briefly, carefully assessing the situation before continuing. “And now, there’s the sudden news of Briley’s pregnancy, and Briley has actively pursued Alex lately. But based on what I know about Alex, this pregnancy is most likely fabricated. It’s probably just Coyle’s desperate attempt to force an alliance with the Howe family and escape his current crisis.”
Her analysis was calm and precise, but hearing the certainty in her voice regarding Alex, Noah felt an unpleasant sensation creeping into his chest. How was it that she knew another man so intimately?
“Oh?” Noah’s voice lifted slightly, his tone subtly probing. “Do you have that much faith in Alex, Ms. Hudson?”
Surprised by the sudden change in Noah’s tone, Sadie glanced up at him, puzzled. She was merely analyzing facts ively—how had he turned it into a matter of personal trust?
“I’m simply drawing logical conclusions from the facts at hand,” she clarified calmly, meeting his eyes directly.

Message from Noah: Have a great week dear readers. God loves you and Noah whishes you all the best. (?  ? – ? ) ?

###Chapter 738:
Noah didn’t respond, but instead leaned in even closer. His silver mask hovered just inches from Sadie’s flushed cheek, his warm breath softly brushing past her ear. A shiver shot through Sadie, her heartbeat faltering as warmth bloomed fiercely across her cheeks.
Just as the tension became almost unbearable, a voice suddenly cut through the silence.
“Sadie!”
Isabel stood frozen in the doorway, holding a bowl of steaming soup. Her eyes widened at the unexpectedly intimate scene she had stumbled upon. Although Patrick wore a mask, his stance and the way he leaned into Sadie radiated an undeniable intimacy.noveldrama
Quickly overcoming her initial shock, Isabel smiled, a mixture of understanding and embarrassment crossing her face. She certainly understood what the scene meant. Despite the brief pang of discomfort at the thought of Noah, Isabel comforted herself. This Patrick seemed like a decent man, and Sadie deserved to move on. Clinging to the past wouldn’t do anyone any good.
“Oh dear! It seems I’ve arrived at an inconvenient moment!” Isabel chuckled apologetically, already taking a step back. “Please, carry on—I didn’t mean to interrupt!”
She swiftly retreated, quietly closing the door behind her with care.
Sadie stood there, stunned, her cheeks burning. She knew exactly what Isabel was thinking. Without thinking, she quickly raised her hand and pressed it firmly against Noah’s chest, pushing him away—not roughly, but with unmistakable resistance.
Noah allowed himself to step back gracefully, quietly noting the mix of embarrassment and irritation flickering across her flushed face. Beneath the silver mask, a faint smile briefly curved his lips.
Sadie turned abruptly toward the window, avoiding his penetrating gaze as she tried to steady her pounding heart.
Noah discarded his earlier teasing tone, his voice settling back into cool neutrality. “You don’t have to worry. New Rise Corporation will not partner with Wall Group,” he assured calmly yet firmly. “Even if Briley truly were pregnant, such a scenario would be impossible.”
His confident declaration immediately piqued Sadie’s curiosity. Turning back to face him, she regarded him inquisitively. Why was he so certain?
First appeared in glnov els.o
Noah didn’t prolong the mystery, directly clarifying the truth. “Yesterday, New Rise Corporation signed an official strategic partnership with the Peterson family abroad. Their next move is expansion into the international market. Right now, they would never bind themselves closely to a domestic entity like Wall Group.”
Understanding instantly dawned on Sadie. No wonder Alex had tossed Coyle out without hesitation. Alex had likely anticipated Coyle’s tricks from the very start and must’ve been thoroughly disgusted with Briley’s attempts. Coyle’s grand scheme—leveraging New Rise Corporation and forcing a marriage alliance—had always been nothing but a fool’s gamble. He had truly dug his own grave.
Sadie silently absorbed the flood of information she’d received, taking a moment to process it all.
.
.
.
###Chapter 739:
Seeing her deep in contemplation, Noah knew he’d accomplished what he’d set out to do. Without another word, he quietly turned and made his way to the door.
“Where are you going?”
The words slipped from Sadie’s lips before she even realized it, leaving her momentarily startled at her own reaction. Why did she care where he was headed?
Noah paused, glancing over his shoulder with an amused, teasing gleam in his eyes, clearly savoring the rare moment of vulnerability she had revealed.
“Naturally, I have to go back,” he answered softly, his voice carrying a playful undertone. “Our plans are almost complete.”
He hesitated briefly, his eyes locked meaningfully onto hers. “I’ll see you soon in Jazmah.”
Sadie immediately understood his implication, nodding calmly without pressing further.
Once the door softly clicked shut behind him, she pulled out her phone and dialed a number, her voice quiet but firm. “Find a way to have the news of New Rise Corporation’s partnership with the Peterson family leaked—discreetly—to the Wall family elders.”
“Understood, Ms. Hudson.”
As Sadie ended the call, her eyes turned cold and determined. Coyle’s last hope was shattered. Now, it was the shareholders’ turn to make their choice.
In the chairman’s office of Wall Group, Coyle stood rigid, his fingers trembling as they tightly clenched the papers in his hand. The document clearly detailed New Rise Corporation’s recent strategic partnership with the Peterson family.
His bloodshot eyes glared at the words, veins bulging furiously on his temples. New Rise had already aligned itself with the Peterson family!
Damn them!noveldrama
Alex Howe—damn that cunning brat!
No wonder Alex had been so dismissive, tossing him out without a second thought. He had already found himself a stronger partner!
Read exclusive stories at gα?ησνs?c?m
Coyle realized Alex had never taken him seriously at all! He had no intention of acknowledging the baby Briley was carrying! Very well, then! Since Alex was being so ruthless and heartless, he had no right to blame him for playing hardball!
A cruel glint appeared in Coyle’s eyes. He picked up the landline and called his assistant. “Get in here.”
The assistant entered mere seconds later, looking nervous and harried. “Mr. Wall.”
Coyle slammed the document on the desk. “Spread the news that Alex abandoned Briley after getting her pregnant. Emphasize that he refuses to take responsibility. I’m going to ruin that rascal’s reputation once and for all!” Coyle couldn’t believe the Howe family could simply brush off the situation.
The assistant paled, his lips trembling as he said, “Mr. Wall…”
.

###Chapter 740:
Coyle scowled at him. “What are you dithering about? Spit it out!”
The assistant swallowed audibly. “Just… I just received some news. Miss Wall has been taken away by Alex’s men.”
Coyle shot up to his feet, his eyes wide with disbelief. “What the hell did you just say?!”
The assistant shook with fright and nearly sank to his knees. The words tumbled out of him in a rush. “Apparently, some people sent by Alex went to Miss Wall’s apartment and took her by force. And… well, Alex’s lawyer is here to see you. He is waiting downstairs. He says Alex intends to sue us for fraud and slander.”
Coyle felt the world spin around him, as if the floor had been pulled from under his feet. How could this happen? Hadn’t he told Briley to hide? Now, what should he do?noveldrama
He slumped back into his chair, looking defeated.
Just then, his private phone rang. The screen displayed the contact number of an elder in the Wall family, Soren Wall. Coyle’s heart sank even farther into the abyss. Those old bastards sure got wind of the situation quickly!
Coyle forced himself to calm down, though his fingers trembled as he picked up the call. His tone was submissive and measured. “Hello, Soren. What an honor to receive a call from you when you’re so busy. Rest assured, the company is doing fine. This is just a minor issue. The problems with Burgess Group and New Rise Corporation will be resolved soon, I promise—”
A cold, elderly voice interrupted his platitudes. “Coyle Wall! Return to Wall Manor immediately!”
Then, before Coyle could say another word, the call disconnected.
Coyle’s forced smile froze on his face. Seconds later, he raised his hand, about to smash his phone out of sheer rage. But he stopped himself halfway through. He swallowed a couple of times, his chest heaving, his face red with anger.
Those old bastards! Always banking on their seniority to throw their weight around!
The assistant lingered by the door, watching Coyle carefully, not daring to even breathe. “Mr. Wall,” he said after a while, “Should we head to Wall Manor?”
Coyle whipped around to glare at him. “Of course! What, should I just wait here until they come to us?!”

He had no choice but to face the music.
At Wall Manor, the atmosphere in the meeting room was grim and oppressive, much like it had been the day they interrogated Sadie. The elders of the Wall family were all present, each of them wearing a stern expression.
Coyle stood in the middle. Now and then, he would reach up to wipe the sweat from his brow. One of the elders sitting on the left suddenly stood up. “Look at the mess you’ve made!” he thundered. “You haven’t even been in charge of the company for long, and you’ve caused so much chaos! The deal with Burgess Group fell through! The New Rise Corporation project is out of reach! And now, we’re facing a lawsuit from the Howe family! Let me ask you one thing—what have you achieved?”
.

###Chapter 741:
“As the chairman so far? I’m starting to think you’re not even half as capable as Sadie!”
No sooner had he said this when another elder snorted in agreement. “Ha! Before Nigel passed, he said Coyle and his family should never be allowed to take control of the family business. It looks like the old man was wise to make such a decision. Some people are just born losers!”
Coyle felt the color drain from his face. His hands were cold as they clenched into fists at his sides. So, these old geezers were now using Nigel’s words against him?
Then why hadn’t they spoken up when he had first schemed to seize power? They were only blaming him now that something had gone wrong!
And Sadie, that wretched woman! This must be her doing!
Coyle gritted his teeth, suppressing both his anger and humiliation. Then he plastered a pleading, pitiful smile on his face. “Everyone, this is all a misunderstanding—a huge misunderstanding!”noveldrama
He went on to make excuses for himself. “I’ve been framed by Sadie! She’s the one who ruined the deal with the Burgess Group, and I’m sure she is also behind this matter with the Howe family! She just can’t stand seeing me and Sutton succeed, so she deliberately set me up!”
But no matter how he explained, the elders were not swayed.
“Framed?” Soren sneered as he slammed his cane against the floor. “Coyle, do you think we’re too old and senile to see sense? We all know Sadie is currently with Isabel and Averi, recuperating in the hot spring resort! How could that feeble young woman in a wheelchair frame you from there? But you! You faked a pregnancy test report and tried to force Alex to marry your daughter! You have utterly disgraced the Wall family name!”
Coyle shuddered, feeling like a bucket of ice water had just been poured over his head. His ears were ringing, and he couldn’t seem to manage a single coherent thought. He finally understood.
Right from the start, it had all been a trap! Sadie had already dug the pit, and she had simply been waiting for him to fall into it.
He had wondered once or twice why she would give up the chairwoman position so easily. It turned out that vicious woman had other plans in the works!
Coyle’s fists tightened, and his breathing grew even heavier.
 ? ? 
“Enough!” Soren brought his cane down again, effectively silencing Coyle.
The meeting room was enveloped in a profound silence. Soren gave Coyle a chilling look, his voice firm and authoritative. “The Wall family adheres to strict rules! Coyle, you are not suited for your role. Resign immediately! Effective now, you are no longer the chairman of Wall Group!”
At Soren’s cue, a bodyguard approached and laid a document before Coyle.
“Sign this share transfer agreement and relinquish your stakes in Wall Group.”
Coyle’s gaze landed on the document, fury igniting in his eyes.
.
.
.
###Chapter 742:
Why should he? Why should he surrender what was rightfully his, especially after battling so fiercely to reach the top?
“I won’t sign!” he declared, desperation coloring his tone. “These are mine! They can’t be taken from me!”
Yet, such defiance proved futile against overwhelming power. Two formidable bodyguards advanced, securing him from each side. No amount of struggling or cursing could change his fate. One guard forcibly took his hand, pressed his thumb into the icy ink pad, and then slammed it down at the end of the agreement.noveldrama
Despair engulfed Coyle. All his efforts, every calculated move he had made, evaporated in seconds.
Soren examined the signed document and nodded approvingly. He signaled the guards once more. With swift understanding, they gripped Coyle’s arms and dragged him from the room, showing no mercy.
“Release me! What are you doing?!” Coyle’s voice was laden with panic as he thrashed about. “I am a Wall family member! You dare lay hands on me?!”
His cries were met with silence from the guards, their hold unyielding.
“According to the family rules, he receives thirty lashes as punishment!” Soren commanded coldly.
Forced to his knees on the cold stone, Coyle felt the strikes of the cane across his back. “Ah!” His screams of agony pierced the air, each lash pushing him closer to oblivion.
Sadie! His current torment stemmed from her actions! As long as he lived, he vowed never to let her go. He would make her life a living hell!
Inside the meeting room, the elders remained unmoved by the cries outside. With Coyle removed, the Wall Group faced a leadership vacuum, and the resulting turmoil required swift resolution.
Soren scanned the room, his tone serious. “The Wall family cannot be leaderless, not even for a day. Given our current predicament, leadership is crucial.”
He paused, letting his gaze drift across the assembled family members. “Who among you is prepared to take on this responsibility?” Silence enveloped the hall. Heads bowed, eyes averted to the floor as if they were in contemplation. They all harbored the same thought—who would dare assume control of Wall Group now? It was akin to walking into a blazing inferno.
With the issues with Burgess Group and Howe Group, and internal chaos, the successor would likely meet the same downfall as Coyle. Only a reckless person would accept such a perilous role.
New chapters now on g@?ησvs.cоm
As the silence lingered, Soren’s expression darkened. This group, usually so keen to grasp at power, now hesitated to shoulder real responsibility!
Finally, amidst the mounting tension, a tentative voice emerged.
“Esteemed elders, I propose a suggestion… although I’m uncertain of its propriety.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 743:
Attention shifted to the speaker, a member of a lesser branch of the family, typically unnoticed.
Soren’s brow furrowed. “Speak.”
The man gulped before proceeding with caution.
“Since no one seems ready to step forward, perhaps we could consider asking Sadie to come back?”
The suggestion triggered a wave of shock.
“Absurd! How can we reinstate a woman who was expelled to lead Wall Group?”
“And what of the scandalous photographs?”
At the mention of the photographs, the man raised his hands soothingly. “Those photographs… who can confirm their authenticity? It’s possible Coyle framed Sadie! Besides, Noah is gone, and she’s still young. Would remarriage really be so ionable?”
This revelation sparked a sudden understanding among everyone present. Indeed! Who else but Sadie had the capability to stabilize the situation? Under her leadership, Wall Group had flourished. Additionally, she retained the networks and assets left by Noah.
With this proposal on the table, the other elders quickly warmed to the idea.
“Yes, that makes sense.”
“Sadie is undoubtedly capable.”
“She is Averi’s mother. For her child’s sake, she wouldn’t allow Wall Group to fail.”
“This is a viable option! We should bring Sadie back!”
The elders unanimously agreed.
With urgency pressing them, they wasted no time in acting on their decision. Soren commanded decisively, “Prepare the vehicles! We’re heading to the hot spring resort immediately to personally invite Sadie back!”
A group of usually reserved and dignified elders set aside their pride for the future of Wall Group. They embarked in a grand convoy toward the suburban hot spring resort.
Back at the meeting hall’s entrance, Coyle lay forgotten and beaten.
?  : ν﹒noveldrama
At the resort, Sadie was with Averi in the indoor play area, engaged in building blocks. Averi, focused, used his chubby hands to stack the colorful blocks.
A resort staff member approached quickly, slightly panting. “Ms. Hudson, several members of the Wall family are here to see you. They seem quite anxious.”
Sadie checked her watch. The timing was as she had anticipated, with the elders showing even more urgency than she had expected.
She placed the blocks aside and affectionately patted Averi’s head. She then turned to the staff member, giving her instructions. “Please look after Averi, and take him to his grandmother’s room in ten minutes.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 744:
“Understood, Ms. Hudson,” the staff member responded, staying near Averi.
Sadie then calmly made her way to the lobby.
In the lounge, several Wall family elders sat, having waited for some time. As soon as Sadie rolled into the room, the elders nearly leapt from their seats, their smiles strained with exaggerated sincerity. Sadie took in their expressions, not missing a beat. It was clear that Coyle had faced a severe setback. Otherwise, these elders, who had traditionally scorned her, wouldn’t be behaving with such deference.
Her expression remained composed, tinged with just a hint of feigned bewilderment, as if she was unaware of the recent events. She moved her wheelchair forward gradually.
“What brings you here, gentlemen?” Her voice was gentle and courteous, maintaining the respect expected of the younger generation. “Is there something you need?”
The elders looked at each other, their discomfort apparent. Silence lingered among them.
Finally, Soren stepped forward, clearing his throat as he struggled with his discomfort. His aged face looked particularly uneasy.
“Sadie,” he began, choosing his words with care. “There’s been some trouble at home and within the company. Coyle… he proved unfit for his role, and we’ve addressed it following family protocols. Now, we find ourselves without a leader, and after much discussion…”
He paused, his gaze fixed on Sadie with earnest desperation. “We hope you can overlook past grievances and return to lead.”noveldrama
The effort of his plea colored his cheeks with a flush of unease. This was the same group that had once supported Coyle’s ascent and facilitated Sadie’s ousting. Now, humbled, they were imploring her to come back and rectify the chaos. The irony was not lost on her.
Sadie listened in silence, her expression unreadable. She seemed to be weighing their plea thoughtfully.
After a considerable silence, she slowly shook her head, her voice laden with weariness.
“I appreciate your intentions, but at this moment, my priority is my role as a mother.”
 ? : g?ν?
She lowered her gaze, her voice softening further. “I just want to peacefully raise my child and spend time with Noah’s mother. As for the company’s matters, I truly don’t have the energy or desire to deal with them anymore.”
Upon hearing this, the elders turned pale. Sadie was refusing to return? What would become of Wall Group? The legacy of the Wall family, nurtured over generations, was teetering on the brink of collapse!
With this realization, the elders set aside their dignity.
“Sadie! You can’t just abandon us!”
“Yes, Sadie, Wall Group cannot survive without you!”
A silver-haired elder spoke, his eyes welling up, his voice breaking with emotion. “It was all our fault back then! We were misguided and believed Coyle’s lies! We misunderstood you!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 745:noveldrama
Another elder joined in, his remorse palpable as he clutched his chest. “Yes! Coyle framed you! Even the scandal with Patrick was orchestrated by him out of jealousy. He was unable to bear your success!”
They all spoke fervently, hastily pinning all the blame on Coyle, who had already suffered severely. Their past indifference, and even their contributions to Sadie’s hardships, seemed forgotten in their current desperation.
As they grew more distressed, some even looked ready to kneel.
“Sadie, we implore you! For Averi’s sake, and in memory of Nigel, please return! We apologize deeply to you!”
Sadie observed the unfolding drama with a concealed smirk. The act was nearly complete, her strategy close to fruition.
She remained silent for a long while, her expression reflecting a struggle with the decision.
Finally, she sighed gently. “Since you all insist, I’ll consider returning.”
At her words, the elders exhaled in unison, relief washing over them as smiles spread across their faces.
“That’s marvelous!”
“Your graciousness is truly commendable!”
“Wall Group is saved!”
Soren swiftly produced a document from his briefcase, presenting it to Sadie with a triumphant grin. “Sadie, these are all the shares Coyle once held. They’re finally back in the hands where they belong—yours.”
Sadie scanned the document, her eyes widening slightly. It wasn’t just the shares she’d given out to let Coyle’s guard down; it also encompassed every single share originally held by Coyle and his family. The wording was explicit, undeniable. Coyle had well and truly lost his grip this time.
Not only had he lost his seat as chairman, but the shares he’d desperately clung to were now stripped away entirely. He wouldn’t pose any threat from now on.
Sadie closed the document gently, a subtle, satisfied smile touching her lips. It was precisely what she’d hoped for.
A sense of relief visibly spread across the elders’ faces as she accepted the papers.
“Sadie.” Soren paused, choosing his words carefully. “The company is facing a challenging time, so…”
His unfinished sentence hung in the air, but everyone knew the implication. They were hoping Sadie would swiftly return to lead Wall Group back to stability.
Sadie nodded resolutely. “I understand. I’ll be there first thing tomorrow.”
At her confident assurance, the tension among the elders dissolved entirely, replaced by dignified composure. Rising to their feet, they warmly exchanged goodbyes before hastening away, undoubtedly eager to deliver the reassuring news to those anxiously awaiting it.

###Chapter 746:
Outside the resort lobby, Blaine lounged casually against his sports car, amusement gleaming in his eyes as he watched the elders hurry toward their vehicles, radiating an air of triumphant urgency.
A playful smirk curled his lips as he called out casually, “Gentlemen! What’s the rush? Why not stay a bit longer? I hear the dinner at this hot spring resort is quite extraordinary. Aren’t you tempted to give it a try?”
The elders paused briefly, glancing toward Blaine. When they recognized him, their expressions soured instantly into awkward discomfort. With dismissive snorts, they climbed swiftly into their cars and sped off without a word.
Blaine chuckled coldly. What a bunch of sly geezers!
He watched the vehicles disappear from sight before pivoting lazily, hands deep in his pockets, and strolling leisurely back toward the lobby.
Sadie was just about to return to her room when Blaine approached, wearing his familiar teasing grin.
“Hey there, Sadie,” he said lightly. “So, how’d it go? Those crusty elders didn’t give you any trouble, did they?”
Sadie shook her head gently, a subtle smile lighting her expression. “It went perfectly,” she replied, waving the document lightly in her hand. “I’ve gotten everything I wanted.”noveldrama
Blaine’s interest sparked immediately as he leaned in, eyebrows lifting in appreciation when he saw the document clearly. He whistled appreciatively.
“Would you look at that! Coyle—that cunning old snake—really hit rock bottom this time. Losing his chairman position was bad enough, but now he’s lost practically everything else he had, too!”
He laughed heartily, clearly reveling in Coyle’s downfall. “If he knew his plotting ultimately gave you such an advantage, he’d probably keel over from sheer rage.”
Meanwhile, inside a private ward at Jazmah Hopevale Hospital, Coyle lay helplessly on the bed, his complexion drained of color and glistening with sweat. He groaned weakly, his voice broken and trembling.
“The pain… it’s unbearable,” he rasped, breath ragged. “It’s killing me…”
The relentless agony radiating from his back nearly pushed him into unconsciousness. The brutal thirty lashes he’d endured had left his skin shredded and his bones shattered.
  ? ．
Standing solemnly at his bedside, the doctor adjusted his white coat and spoke in a cautious, measured tone. “Mr. Wall, your injuries are extensive. The damage to your spine is serious—it’s very likely you’ll never regain the ability to walk.”
The doctor’s words struck Coyle like a thunderbolt, shattering his pride into countless pieces. Impossible. Him? Reduced to a cripple?
His eyes snapped open fiercely, filled with unbridled fury as he glared at the doctor.
“Get out!” he roared, his voice quivering with rage and desperation. “You’re all useless! Worthless quacks—every single one of you! Get out!”
He couldn’t accept this fate. Living out his days confined to a wheelchair? That was a punishment worse than death itself!
.
.
.
###Chapter 747:
Startled by Coyle’s furious eruption, the doctor hurriedly stepped back, gesturing for the nurse to follow him out. Nearby, Coyle’s assistant stood frozen, trembling silently, afraid to even breathe loudly.
Chest heaving, Coyle glared at the assistant, his eyes seething with rage.
“What are you standing around for?” he snarled viciously. “Find another doctor! The best there is! If no one in Jazmah can help, search overseas—spare no expense! Do whatever it takes to heal me!”
The mere thought of permanent disability was utterly unacceptable.
The assistant jolted awake from his stupor, nodding vigorously. “Yes, sir! I’ll take care of it immediately!”
He was already turning toward the door when Coyle suddenly remembered something and sharply halted him.
“Wait!”
The assistant froze mid-step, quickly turning back with a submissive bow, awaiting further instructions.
Coyle’s voice lowered, becoming hoarse and thick with bitterness. “Where is Sadie? That damned woman—where is she now?”
All of this suffering—this humiliation—was because of her!
The assistant’s forehead was slick with anxious perspiration. He shifted nervously, eyes darting everywhere except toward Coyle’s fierce gaze.
After an agonizing pause, he finally spoke, choosing his words cautiously. “Sir… Ms. Hudson returned to the company this morning. They held a grand ceremony to welcome her back.”
He hesitated, swallowing hard before continuing. “I’ve heard representatives from Mr. Noel’s Burgess Group visited personally, eager to renew their partnership with Wall Group.”noveldrama
His voice dwindled to barely a whisper, his eyes anxiously flicking toward Coyle’s darkening expression. He wished desperately to stop there, but the words spilled uncontrollably from his mouth. “And Ms. Hudson immediately removed everyone you’d positioned within various departments. Not a single person was spared.”
That final revelation was too much—it shattered the last remnants of Coyle’s fragile composure. His carefully orchestrated schemes, dismantled so effortlessly?
Fury and despair surged together, rising uncontrollably, leaving a metallic bitterness in his throat. Coyle’s vision blurred, his pulse thundered wildly, and suddenly, he spat out a mouthful of blood. His eyes widened with shock, fixating numbly on the blank white ceiling.
Your source: glnvls.
“Sadie Hudson!” he hissed, his voice strangled with venom, his body convulsing violently, foam forming at the corners of his mouth as consciousness slipped away.
The assistant watched, horrified, his face ghostly pale. He rushed frantically to Coyle’s bedside, panic evident as he saw the spasms overtaking his boss.
.
.
.
###Chapter 748:
“Sir! Sir! Someone—Doctor! Quickly!”
Coyle’s assistant, Terrell Odom, shouted desperately, his voice cracking as tears threatened to spill.
At that exact moment, the ward door swung open quietly.
Sadie stood calmly in the doorway, her composed gaze sweeping across the room, pausing briefly as she took in the scene.
On the bed, Coyle lay barely clinging to consciousness, his pale face contorted in pain, eyes squeezed shut, only the faint rise and fall of his chest indicating he still drew breath.
Terrell froze, utterly stunned by Sadie’s unexpected arrival. His eyes widened, fingers shaking nervously. Why was she here now? What was her intention? His mind went blank, panic surging within him, immobilizing him completely.
Sadie’s lips curled into a subtle yet mocking smile as her eyes fell upon Terrell. “What are you waiting for? Shouldn’t you be fetching a doctor? Your boss looks like he’s on the verge of death.”
Her voice carried a deceptive sweetness edged sharply with sarcasm.
Terrell, relieved to be given a reason to flee, hastily scrambled from the room.
With deliberate steps, Sadie approached Coyle’s bedside.
She paused at Coyle’s bedside, gazing down with a composed, almost serene expression. Her voice was soft, deceptively pleasant, as she gently inquired, “How are you feeling now, Coyle?”
At the sound of her voice, Coyle’s eyelids twitched violently. With immense effort, he forced them open, locking his bloodshot, venomous stare onto hers. His body shook uncontrollably, lips trembling as he forced out a bitter, broken whisper.
“You vile woman… you’ll suffer a miserable end.”
Sadie didn’t bother responding—there was little point arguing with someone who was barely hanging onto life. Instead, she calmly retrieved a document from her bag.
It was an official letter from Alex’s lawyer.
 сρ ﹒
With practiced ease, she placed it neatly on the bedside table.
“Oh, and there’s something else I nearly forgot to tell you,” she continued softly, a faint chill edging into her voice. “Briley has been officially expelled from the Wall family due to her reckless behavior and the disgrace she’s brought upon us.”
Her words hit like a devastating strike, crushing whatever fight remained in Coyle’s weakened body. His eyes bulged, breath suddenly hitching, panic and fury tangling in his throat as he desperately gasped for air.noveldrama
He opened his mouth, struggling to utter a curse that never fully materialized, yet Sadie read his lips perfectly.
“You… wretched woman…”
Just then, a team of doctors and nurses hurriedly burst into the room, immediately surrounding Coyle’s bed. The lead physician swiftly examined him, his expression turning grim after only moments.
.
.
.
###Chapter 749:
He straightened up, his voice solemn as he explained, “The patient’s severe emotional agitation has caused a rupture of the cerebral blood vessels.”
“Coyle—you’ve just suffered a major stroke.”
Sadie’s composed smile remained firmly in place, though a flicker of mock concern briefly touched her eyes. Reaching out, she gently patted Coyle’s trembling shoulder.
“Rest up, Coyle. You don’t need to worry about anything else,” she said softly, her voice soothing yet coldly triumphant. “The company is safe in my hands now. I’ll take good care of it.”noveldrama
Without bothering to spare another glance at Coyle’s livid, helpless form, Sadie turned and strode calmly from the room.
Outside in the corridor, Samuel was pacing nervously, anxiety etched deeply into his features. The moment he caught sight of Sadie, he quickly approached, lowering his voice as he relayed urgent news.
“Ms. Hudson, Sutton was found dead—his body was discovered by police at Eastwood Mountain.”
Sadie’s brows knitted slightly in surprise, her footsteps coming to a halt as the gravity of the situation sank in.
“Dead?” Her voice turned grave. “What exactly happened?”
She had been aware of Sutton’s disappearance—but how did he end up dead?
Samuel shook his head solemnly. “The details aren’t clear yet. The police have sealed off the area and started their investigation.”
He hesitated briefly before adding, “Mr. Blaine Castro is already on-site.”
Sadie paused thoughtfully, a dark suspicion beginning to form in her mind. Sutton’s death—it was undoubtedly suspicious. At this critical moment, there was no room for mistakes.
“We need to get there immediately,” Sadie said firmly, stepping swiftly into the car waiting outside the hospital.
Samuel quickly followed, settling beside her. The car promptly merged into the bustling traffic, disappearing among the city’s vehicles. Unnoticed, a sleek black sedan started silently from a discreet distance behind them.
Inside the car sat Noah. He carefully removed his mask, unveiling a striking yet weary face. He’d visited the hospital merely for a routine check-up, never expecting to catch sight of Sadie. Seeing her there, clearly unsettled and in a hurry, sparked something restless within him. Something was wrong—very wrong.
LΑττ chαρτ?rs ιn glov?l.
After a moment’s hesitation, he instructed his driver calmly yet firmly, “Follow that car!” With a nod, the driver subtly shifted lanes, quietly trailing Sadie’s car at a safe distance.
Half an hour later, Sadie’s vehicle pulled to a halt outside Eastwood Police Station. She stepped out gracefully, her eyes briefly settling on the station’s prominent sign.
.
.
.
###Chapter 750:
Inside, Blaine stood conversing urgently with several police officers, his expression visibly tense. Spotting her arrival, Blaine quickly excused himself and approached, concern evident in his voice.
“Sadie, what are you doing here?” he asked earnestly, worry shading his eyes.
This wasn’t where Sadie should be at all.
Sadie was momentarily taken aback. Her gaze flicked rapidly between Blaine and the group of officers standing nearby. Confusion clouded her thoughts—what exactly was going on?
Just then, the police officers approached her. Leading the group was a seasoned officer with a square jaw and a stern, unyielding gaze. He studied Sadie intently for a moment before pulling out a clear evidence bag, holding it up for all to see. Inside the bag was a peculiar-looking pendant stained with dark red—a pendant Sadie didn’t recognize in the slightest.
“Ms. Hudson, we found this item on the victim, Sutton Wall. Initial investigations show that this pendant belongs to an exclusive designer handbag—registered specifically under your name.”
He paused deliberately, eyes narrowing slightly, sharp and piercing.
“We now have reason to suspect you are involved in Mr. Wall’s murder. Please cooperate fully with our investigation.”
Sadie stared blankly at the pendant in the bag, disbelief flooding her senses. Her mind raced, her heartbeat accelerating as she struggled to comprehend the situation unfolding before her. This was absurd. She had never seen that pendant—it wasn’t hers at all!
Noah quietly entered the station, just in time to overhear the officer’s startling accusation. He froze in place. His face remained unreadable behind his silver mask, but the air around him grew undeniably colder. Shock pierced through him like ice. Sadie… accused of murder?noveldrama
Noah furrowed his brows as he stepped forward. Clutched in the officer’s hand was an evidence bag, and Noah could instantly tell what was inside—the pendant definitely belonged to the limited-edition handbag Hailey had recently bought. Why was it on Sutton’s body? And what role did Sadie play in this?
Noah’s face set into a grim line, yet he remained silent. He had a gut feeling that something was off, and he needed time to piece it all together. Without saying anything, he turned and left the police station.
Sadie watched the man wearing the silver mask. His retreat was marked by a chilling aloofness. When had he shown up? Why was he here? But now wasn’t the time to ponder these questions.
Discover the rest on oν?
She faced the officer again, aware that the situation was not in her favor. The evidence seemed to point directly at her, but she was sure the pendant didn’t belong to her. Explaining now might seem like she was scrambling to prove her innocence.
Taking a deep breath, Sadie collected herself. She looked the middle-aged officer in the eye and said evenly, “I’m ready to cooperate with your investigation. However, before we head to the interrogation room, I need a moment to discuss some urgent business matters with my colleague.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 751:
She was referring to Blaine, who was standing beside her. The officer eyed her for a second, then glanced at Blaine, who appeared anxious. After a pause, he agreed.
“Alright, you have twenty minutes.”
Considering Sadie’s position as chairwoman of Wall Group, the flexibility seemed justified. She signaled to Blaine to come closer.
In a hushed tone, she instructed, “Blaine, go back to the office and stabilize things. Coyle is out—we can’t let things spiral.”
Blaine nodded solemnly, his usually relaxed demeanor now somber.
“Got it, Sadie. I’ll handle it.”
After a short pause, Sadie added, “There’s something else. Check on that pendant.”
A vague memory flashed through her mind—an image of a day long past when she had been at that upscale boutique downtown, searching for a birthday present for Isabel. She was drawn to a newly released handbag, its design remarkably distinct. Dangling from the handbag was a pendant, looking exactly like the one sealed in the evidence bag.
She vividly recalled preparing to have it gift-wrapped when Hailey and Sutton entered the boutique one after the other. Preferring to avoid any interaction with them, she had left the store without buying the bag.
“Head to that boutique and look up their sales records. See who purchased that handbag after I walked out.”
Blaine paid close attention, his usual playful spark now replaced by serious resolve. He grasped the urgency of the matter, recognizing the setup.
Firmly, he pledged, “Don’t worry, Sadie. You can count on me. Grandpa made me promise to keep you safe, and I intend to keep that promise.”
Sadie felt a slight easing of her burden. She nodded. “Alright. I trust you.” Time was pressing. She gave Blaine a final look. “The company is yours to manage now.” She then turned decisively and followed the officer to the interrogation room.
Blaine stood firm for a moment, his hands balling into fists. He was determined to uncover the mastermind behind this scheme. With resolve, he turned and exited the police station.noveldrama
Meanwhile, Noah arrived back at his suburban villa. The dining table was lavishly set, each dish carefully presented. Hailey, wearing an apron, welcomed him with a gentle smile.
“Noah, you’re back.” Her voice carried a note of soft flattery. “I’ve prepared some of your favorite dishes today.”
Noah glanced at the table, his expression unreadable. Without a word, he walked over to the sofa and sat down.
He addressed Hailey without looking up, his voice cool. “Have you seen Sutton?”
Hailey’s smile stiffened. Her fingers gripped the hem of her apron tightly, and a cold fear crept up her spine. Had the body been discovered already?
.
.
.
###Chapter 752:
She maintained her composure, managing to keep her smile, though it was noticeably strained.
“Sutton Wall? No, I haven’t seen him. I did hear he’s been missing, though.” Her eyes betrayed a flicker of unease as she tentatively asked, “Why? Has something happened to him?”
Noah’s expression was icy as he held her stare. A slight smirk appeared on his lips.noveldrama
“The police found his body in Eastwood Mountain.”
He paused, letting the gravity of his words sink in before continuing, “And now, Sadie is being investigated for murder.”
Hailey’s expression betrayed no surprise; instead, there was a hint of relief. She was pleased that Sadie had been arrested.
With a slight smile and a touch of regret in her voice, she said, “Sutton was a Wall. Ms. Hudson is ruthless with her rivals—she didn’t even spare her own family.”
Noah’s response was icy. “I didn’t say Sadie was the murderer. The investigation is still ongoing.”
He reached into his pocket and placed a photograph on the coffee table. The photo displayed a distinctive pendant from a handbag.
Hailey’s eyes narrowed slightly at the sight. That pendant… Her heart raced, a wave of dread sweeping over her.
Pretending to be intrigued, she picked up the photo. “Oh? Isn’t this the pendant from my bag? I’ve been looking for it for days. It turns out it…”
She stopped, looking up at Noah with feigned confusion. “Noah, where did you find this? Where is it?”
Noah’s look was frosty. “It’s with the police. Specifically, it was found on Sutton’s body. They think it might have been left by the murderer.”
Hailey’s complexion drained. The photo trembled in her hand and fell to the carpet. She couldn’t hold Noah’s gaze; her eyes flicked around, seeking an exit. Noah watched her closely, his face unreadable. His tone was sharp, pressing her. “The truth will surface eventually. Hailey, what really happened?”
Panicking, Hailey knew she couldn’t keep up her facade. Tears filled her eyes, and she grabbed Noah’s arm.
“Noah, I… I had no choice! It was Sutton who cornered me first!” She sobbed uncontrollably, her body shaking. “He approached me that day—he tried to… he tried to assault me. I just reacted. I didn’t mean to kill him!”
g?ν.?n – ?
She deliberately omitted any reference to her past involvement with Sutton. Noah observed her breakdown, but his expression remained detached, the disappointment evident as any sympathy faded. Was this the compassionate woman he once knew?
Hailey noticed his silence, her desperation intensifying.
“Noah, have you forgotten? Three years ago, I saved your life! If it hadn’t been for me, you might still be in a hospital bed!” She attempted to manipulate him with guilt.
“Besides, Sadie’s been arrested, right? Can’t we just let this go?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 753:
Noah couldn’t suppress a bitter laugh. Was Hailey really going to let someone else bear the blame for her own actions? He had once believed Sadie to be cunning and ruthless. However, recent interactions had revealed a different side of her, while Hailey—the woman he thought he knew—now seemed the true villain.
With a weary sigh, Noah summoned his bodyguards.
“Keep her confined to the villa. Make sure she doesn’t leave.”
Hailey’s eyes widened in shock.
“Noah! What are you doing? How could you do this to me?” She struggled as two bodyguards held her firmly.
“Let go of me! Noah, let me explain!”
Her pleas and screams fell on deaf ears as Noah turned away. The bodyguards then pulled Hailey away. Silence settled over the room.
Noah massaged his temples, then walked into his study. He picked up the phone and called his assistant, Jack Ashton.
“Look into the details of Sutton’s murder. Also, find out what Sutton had over Hailey that pushed her to this extreme.”
Before Jack could reply, Noah added, “And see to it that Sadie is treated fairly at the police station.”
Jack paused, surprised by his compassion for Sadie. Despite his confusion, Jack responded, “Understood. I’ll handle them right away.”
The call concluded. Noah leaned back, his face a mask of unreadable thoughts.
Meanwhile, Blaine rushed back to the Wall Group headquarters. He entered the secretarial department, his expression serious. He quickly relayed instructions to Samuel.
Samuel nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation.
“Don’t worry, Mr. Castro. I’ll manage things here.”
As an experienced and professional assistant, Samuel knew what needed to be prioritized. Without saying another word, Blaine left the office.
    ?ν﹒
Blaine was acutely aware that he needed to quickly focus on the pendant to clear Sadie’s name.
Just as the elevator doors slid open, he collided with a small figure. Tina, clutching a stack of documents, staggered back, almost losing her balance.
“Ouch!”
She looked up, recognizing Blaine.
After steadying herself and adjusting her glasses, she began, “Mr. Castro, where are you going? Aren’t you aware there’s a department meeting at three this afternoon? You…”
Before she could finish, Blaine had brushed past, his rapid stride toward the company’s entrance signaling urgency.

###Chapter 754:
Tina stood there, bewildered. What was happening? Was this some kind of emergency?
Holding her documents tightly, she hurried after Blaine.
“Mr. Castro, wait up!”
Reaching his car, Blaine swung the door open. He paused, noticing Tina had managed to catch up, panting. He realized that, as a man, he would attract too much attention inquiring about the bag at the luxury boutique. Tina would be the perfect companion.noveldrama
He motioned for her to join him.
“Hop in.”
Tina, slightly perplexed but noting Blaine’s grave demeanor, climbed into the passenger seat without further questions.
As they drove toward the city center, Blaine quickly filled her in on Sadie’s arrest and the mysterious pendant.
Tina’s complexion paled as she absorbed the news.
Sadie? Accused of murder? How could that be?
It had to be a setup. Anger tightened her grip on the documents.
Thirty minutes later, they pulled up in front of an opulent boutique.
They exited the car, Blaine now sporting his customary sardonic grin. He casually draped an arm around Tina’s shoulders, feigning intimacy. Feeling slightly awkward but committed to aiding Sadie, Tina leaned into the role.
They were greeted warmly by a uniformed clerk as they entered the boutique.
“Good afternoon, sir, madam. How may I assist you today?”
Blaine’s eyes sparkled as he gestured towards Tina, his posture relaxed, his voice warm.
“Could you help my sweetheart find a lovely bag? We’d like to see your newest and limited editions.”
The clerk, accustomed to indulgent patrons and noting Tina’s demure pose as she stood close to Blaine, quickly pegged them as a wealthy young couple on a lavish shopping spree. These types of customers were always the most lavish and easiest to please.
Verified and published at g ln ovels.
The clerk’s smile brightened.
“Certainly, sir. We’ve just received our spring and summer collections, which I believe would perfectly complement the lady’s style. Please follow me.”
They were led to the display area.
With Blaine’s arm casually draped around her, Tina felt a bit out of her element. He seemed fully invested in their cover story. She gave herself a small pinch to snap back into character, adopting a look of sweet anticipation.
While the clerk enthusiastically showcased various bags, Blaine appeared casually interested, but his eyes darted around the store. He was on the lookout for that specific pendant.
.
.
.
###Chapter 755:
Then, he spotted it within a glass display case.
There it was—a luxury bag with a simple yet elegant design, and the identical pendant dangling from it.
He had found it!
His heart surged, but he kept his excitement under wraps. He pointed towards the display case.
“Could we take a closer look at that bag?”
The clerk turned, following his finger, and then offered a polite yet regretful smile.
“I’m sorry, sir, but that particular bag is part of a limited collection and is just for display.”
She paused, then continued, “Actually, we had a replica of this design made about half a month ago. It was bought by a customer then.”
She reminisced briefly, “I recall it was quite sought after; there was even a little commotion among the interested buyers.”noveldrama
Blaine’s heart raced at the revelation. But he still maintained his nonchalant demeanor, probing further.
“Really? It was that popular? Who was the fortunate buyer?”
As he inquired, he gave Tina a subtle nod. Tina immediately picked up on the signal. Her eyes gleamed as she leaned in, almost touching the glass case.
“Darling, this one is gorgeous! I absolutely must have it! Could you get it for me?” she cooed, gently pulling on Blaine’s arm with a playful plea.
The clerk’s smile widened.
“This lady certainly has excellent taste; that replica was…”
Before she could continue, a middle-aged woman with a professional demeanor approached. She appeared to be the manager.
She glanced at Blaine and Tina, then addressed the young clerk. “Please attend to other customers. I’ll take over here.” The clerk nodded and stepped away.
Turning back to Tina and Blaine, the manager said courteously, “The bag was sold, but we do have other new items this season. Would you like to see them?”
Mr? ont?nt : glov?ls.○
Blaine maintained his smile, his approach amiable yet persuasive.
“My girlfriend has really set her heart on that one. How about you help us by providing the contact details of the purchaser? I’d like to see if they’re open to a negotiation.”
Blaine kept his friendly demeanor.
The manager’s expression shifted subtly, a slight furrow in her brow revealing her hesitation.
The sales manager had clearly never encountered such a request before, and her polite smile slipped into a cautious frown.
“I’m sorry, sir, but customer privacy is something we take very seriously here,” she explained firmly. “We can’t disclose that information.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 756:
Blaine’s friendly demeanor faltered slightly, frustration creeping into his expression. This manager was proving tougher than he’d anticipated.
Just as he opened his mouth to argue, the manager discreetly glanced toward two tall security guards stationed nearby. Immediately sensing her signal, the guards approached silently, positioning themselves imposingly beside Blaine and Tina. Their silent presence made the message unmistakable.
With a cool and dismissive tone, the manager said, “Sir, madam, it’s best if you leave now.”
Blaine clenched his jaw, muttering an irritated curse under his breath. Clearly, he wouldn’t get anywhere here.
Grabbing Tina’s arm, who was still visibly stunned, he turned abruptly to leave. Lingering any further would only be a waste of time.
The manager watched warily as the two hurriedly left, a faint crease appearing on her forehead. Something about their inquiry felt off.
With a dismissive shake of her head, she turned and entered the employees’ lounge.
Outside, the street buzzed with afternoon activity as Blaine and Tina made their way briskly toward their parked car, frustration etched clearly on their faces.
“What now, Mr. Castro?” Tina asked anxiously, on the brink of tears. “Without that customer’s information, how can we prove Sadie’s innocence?”
Blaine exhaled sharply, struggling to maintain a calm facade. The direct approach had clearly failed, and sneaking in unnoticed was practically impossible given the store’s tight security.
They needed a different plan—and quickly.
Meanwhile, inside the employees’ lounge, the manager bowed slightly toward a man seated quietly, his expression unreadable, dressed impeccably in a black suit.
“Mr. Ashton, they’ve already left,” she reported respectfully.
Jack, Noah’s assistant, acknowledged her with a slight nod before casually pulling a bank card from his jacket pocket and placing it deliberately onto the nearby table.
“You understand clearly what you should—and should not—say, correct?” His voice was calm yet chilling, filled with subtle menace.
gaν.kn –  ? ?
Immediately understanding the card’s implications—both as compensation for her silence and a stern warning—the manager quickly nodded in compliance.
“Absolutely clear, Mr. Ashton. Don’t worry, it’s handled.”
Without another word, Jack stood, quietly exiting the lounge.
Stepping outside into a quiet corner away from prying eyes, he swiftly took out his phone, dialing a number he knew by heart. The call connected almost instantly.
“Mr. Noel,” he greeted calmly.noveldrama
On the other end, Noah’s voice was steady and cool. “Speak.”
Jack reported succinctly, without hesitation, “Blaine Castro visited the boutique today. Clearly, he’s looking into the handbag.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 757:
Noah fell silent, absorbing the information before finally speaking in a cool, measured tone. “And the investigation—any developments?”
Jack replied steadily, “The last people Sutton interacted with before his death were Ms. Burgess and a woman named Dottie Hatfield.” There might be more clues on this woman named Dottie.
Noah exhaled softly, a faintly disdainful sound. This tangled web was becoming increasingly troublesome, and he knew he had to tighten his grip quickly.
“Deal with it immediately,” Noah said, his voice firm and detached. “Leave no traces. Nothing about this incident should reach the public.”
“Understood, Mr. Noel,” Jack responded promptly and respectfully. As the call ended, Jack’s expression hardened, his gaze becoming colder.
His next priority was locating Dottie.
Early the next morning, in a temporary holding room at Eastwood Police Station, Sadie was abruptly informed that she was free to go—the real perpetrator had surrendered.
Bewildered but relieved, she silently followed an officer out of the station.
Samuel was already waiting anxiously outside. The car door closed firmly, shutting out the morning noise. Sadie settled into the back seat, her eyes turning sharply toward Samuel.
In a calm, controlled voice, she asked, “Who turned themselves in?”
Samuel started the engine, merging quietly into traffic before answering in a lowered, cautious tone, “It’s a woman named Dottie Hatfield.” His eyes were fixed firmly on the road ahead as he continued, “She claims she was Sutton’s girlfriend. According to her statement, she killed him in a sudden burst of anger.”
Sadie’s delicate brows knitted together, a hint of suspicion flickering in her eyes. A crime of passion—and an immediate confession afterward? That seemed far too convenient, too neatly arranged.
She stared thoughtfully out the window, watching the city blur past.
“Have someone look into this ‘Dottie’ immediately,” she said decisively. “Dig deeper into her background and her true connection to Sutton. Something about this doesn’t sit right with me.”
She paused briefly, then added, her voice softer, more cautious, “Has anyone informed Coyle yet about Sutton’s death?”
Samuel shook his head gently. “I don’t believe so.”
Sadie fell silent. No matter how disgraceful Sutton had been, he remained a Wall, Coyle’s only son.
Sadie sighed slowly, a quiet resolve filling her voice. “Have someone inform Coyle. Respect for the dead must come first.”
Samuel acknowledged softly, “Understood.”

###Chapter 758:
In an upscale private ward, Coyle lay immobile, his face distorted grotesquely from the stroke, saliva dripping uncontrollably down his chin. His lips trembled as he strained futilely to speak, only managing indistinct, guttural noises. His eyes brimmed with bitter humiliation.
Standing nervously by his bedside, Terrell watched his employer—who had once been formidable but was now reduced to this pitiful state—both anxious and fearful.
After agonizing hesitation, he finally mustered his courage, leaning closer and whispering cautiously, “Mr. Wall, there’s… there’s news about your son. Sutton…”
His voice trailed off, faltering. He was unable to finish.noveldrama
Coyle’s cloudy, desperate eyes shifted sharply, meeting Terrell’s gaze with a sudden, dreadful clarity.
Gathering all his resolve, Terrell drew a shaky breath, shut his eyes briefly, and forced the devastating words out.
“Mr. Wall, Sutton… is dead. His body was discovered in Eastwood Mountain.”
The words struck Coyle like a bolt of lightning—sudden, brutal, and impossible to ignore. His eyes flew wide open, bulging with disbelief.
Even with all of Sutton’s flaws—his recklessness, his arrogance, his constant string of scandals—he was still Coyle’s son. His blood. His only heir.
“No!”
With a strangled cry, Coyle lashed out with his only working hand, seizing his assistant’s arm in a vice-like grip. His mouth moved frantically, but the words that came out were garbled and unintelligible. Still, the urgency in his eyes screamed one thing. “Tell me everything.”
Terrell winced under the painful grasp but didn’t dare to pull away. Swallowing his fear, he began to speak, his voice shaking.
“The police said Sutton was killed by his girlfriend… supposedly in a fit of jealousy. The woman has already turned herself in.”
He hesitated for a moment, then added in a softer tone, “But… there’s more. I heard that Ms. Hudson was also taken in for questioning. They suspected her involvement—but she was released early this morning.”
Sadie.
? ? ?  —  ? ν
That wretched woman—again!
Coyle’s vision blurred with rage, his eyes bloodshot and wild. Froth gathered at the corners of his mouth, dripping more furiously now as his fury surged.
Girlfriend?
Some random woman dared murder his son?
It couldn’t be!
It had to be Sadie.
.
.
.
###Chapter 759:
In his mind, the narrative was crystal clear—Sadie killed Sutton and paid off some pitiful woman to take the blame.
She had already left him paralyzed, his body broken, his dignity in ruins. Now she had killed his heir—his future.
She was hell-bent on annihilating his legacy.
Coyle trembled with the intensity of his rage, gasping for air, his chest rising and falling in violent waves. He stared daggers at Terrell, his slurred voice desperate and twisted by emotion.
“Th-the doctor… have… have you found one?”
His legs couldn’t be lost. He needed to recover. He needed revenge.
Terrell nodded hastily, clutching at the glimmer of hope. “Yes! Yes, I found someone! A doctor named Lennon Fowler. He said he comes from a long line of traditional healers—specializing in bone injuries, rare cases, the kind other doctors can’t treat!”
Coyle’s gaze calmed slightly, the storm in his eyes momentarily subsiding. If this man could restore him, even a fraction of his former strength—he would rise again. And when he did, Sadie would pay.
“Bring… him in!”
Terrell bolted from the room, eager to escape the suffocating tension. Moments later, he returned, escorting a man behind him.
Coyle blinked, baffled.
The figure standing at the door was dressed in worn, patched clothes, his shoes scuffed, his presence almost laughable.
His hands rubbed together nervously, and when he smiled, a row of yellowed teeth gleamed.
“Mr. Wall, I presume?” he said with a thick rural drawl. “No need to worry. Healing folks is what my family does best. You break a bone, and we fix it right up—easy as cooking soup!”
Coyle’s lip curled in disgust. This was the miracle doctor? This bumpkin? He nearly ordered the man out then and there—but paused. The best specialists in Jazmah had already thrown up their hands.
He had no options left. Right now, pride had to be swallowed. What he needed was a chance to strike back.
g?ν.0;  ?
As Coyle remained silent, his eyes locked in a cold, assessing stare, Lennon’s gaze flickered nervously. After a beat, he cleared his throat and spoke again, this time with a sheepish grin and a hint of opportunism.
“Well, you know… treating someone like you ain’t exactly cheap.” His voice carried a blend of awkwardness and quiet calculation.
Before Coyle could even attempt a response, Terrell jumped in, eager to smooth things over. “Dr. Fowler, rest assured—if you can help Mr. Wall walk again, you’ll be handsomely compensated!”
.
.
.noveldrama
###Chapter 760:
Lennon’s grin widened, and a glint of greed lit up his eyes.
“That’s what I like to hear! But, uh, just so you know… where I come from, there’s a little rule—payment upfront, then the healing! I’ll need to get herbs, prep the meds, you understand. All that costs money.”
Coyle, unwilling to waste time on haggling, gave Terrell a slight nod.
Terrell took the signal immediately. He reached into his bag, pulled out a bank card, and held it out.
“There’s two million on this as a deposit. If Mr. Wall makes a full recovery, you’ll be rewarded even more.”
Lennon’s eyes went wide with delight. He snatched the card like a child handed candy, cradling it as if it were made of gold.
“Now that’s what I call sincerity! Don’t worry, Mr. Wall—once I’m through, you’ll be walking like a colt in spring!”
Lennon brightened, invigorated by the promise of wealth. He bowed beside the bed and began pulling odd, mismatched items from his battered cloth satchel—everything from murky pills to strange, jewel-toned powders, and a set of long, razor-thin needles that looked more threatening than medicinal.
Muttering under his breath, he first handed Coyle a handful of chalky, bitter-smelling pills.
With visible reluctance, Coyle swallowed them. Lennon then mixed the powders with a viscous, amber liquid into a paste and smeared it carefully across Coyle’s bruised and battered back.
The entire process looked questionable—more like folk magic than medicine. But to Coyle’s astonishment, the throbbing agony in his spine began to dull. It didn’t vanish, but the relief was noticeable—real.
For the first time in days, he could breathe without gritting his teeth.
Could this unrefined country quack actually possess some skill?
Lennon’s grin stretched across his weathered face, his expression sly beneath the deep wrinkles.noveldrama
The rest on g?ν?
“I’m glad you’re feeling better, Mr. Wall,” he said, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction.
“Well, I’ve got some pressing business elsewhere, so if you’ll excuse me…” With a final toothy grin, he slipped out of the room.
The moment he stepped outside, Lennon pulled the bank card from his coat like a sacred treasure, holding it up to the light as if expecting it to glow. His eyes sparkled with unfiltered greed.
Two million! From a paralyzed old goat! He chuckled to himself, pocketing the card like it was the crown jewel of his crooked career.
A veterinarian by trade, he was used to setting farm animals straight—cows, goats. But today? Today he had conned his way into high society and walked out with a fortune.

###Chapter 761:
He turned to leave, already fantasizing about how he’d spend the money. Then—whump! Out of nowhere, a black bag dropped from above, swallowing him whole.
He didn’t even have time to scream.
Lennon felt himself yanked off the floor, the bag muffling his surroundings as he was swiftly dragged into a vehicle. The entire abduction took mere seconds—so sudden, so smooth, he didn’t even get the chance to shout.
In the office of Wall Group’s chairwoman, Samuel had just finished delivering his update: the Burgess Group’s dinner event had been rescheduled for Monday. He turned to leave, but something tugged at his mind. He hesitated, his steps slowing.
Sadie, seated at her desk, caught the hesitation immediately. Her eyes narrowed slightly.
“What is it?” she asked, her voice even. “Is there something else?”
Samuel hesitated for a beat, then spoke, his tone holding an edge of uncertainty. “There’s word from the hospital… Coyle has brought in a doctor. Apparently, he’s seeking treatment for his legs.”
Sadie’s brow arched subtly, mild surprise flickering across her expression. Even after everything, Coyle’s will to fight remained unshaken. That man clung to power like a drowning man to driftwood.noveldrama
She leaned back slightly, fingers tapping lightly on the desk. “And the doctor?” she asked. “Who is he?”
At Sadie’s question, Samuel’s normally composed expression cracked, his lips twitching as he barely suppressed a laugh.
“The so-called doctor is actually a veterinarian. He managed to scam Coyle out of two million as a ‘treatment deposit.'” He couldn’t help it—his shoulders shook slightly with amusement. Then, he added, a mischievous glint in his eye, “And as soon as he walked out of the hospital, our people intercepted him. Let’s just say… he won’t be scamming anyone else for a while.”
Sadie blinked, momentarily speechless. Then she exhaled with a slow shake of her head, equal parts disbelief and exasperation.
“Coyle… honestly.”
Even lying half-paralyzed in a hospital bed, the man still found a way to create a spectacle.
Check exclusive content gα?ησνs?com
A complete, ridiculous farce.
“What a piece of work,” she muttered under her breath, waving a hand dismissively. “Forget it. He’s not worth our time.”
Samuel nodded. “Understood.”
He turned to go, but then paused again, something else coming to mind.
“By the way, Ms. Hudson—Mr. Howe from Howe Group reached out. He’d like to meet with you tonight. Said there’s something important he needs to discuss.”
Sadie’s hand stilled mid-movement, the pen in her fingers pausing on the paper. For a second, she considered saying no. Her instinct was to keep her distance from Alex. The lines between their families were already too tangled.
.
.
.
###Chapter 762:
But then Briley came to mind—and the weight of what had happened. The Wall family’s branch had sparked the chaos that pulled the Howe family into scandal.
As the head of Wall Group, she knew she couldn’t ignore that.
With a quiet sigh, she set the pen down. “Alright. Let Mr. Howe know I’ll be there on time.”noveldrama
“Of course, Ms. Hudson.” Samuel gave a small bow of acknowledgment.
That evening, Sadie arrived at the upscale restaurant as scheduled. A waiter greeted her with a courteous nod and led her through the elegant dining space to a private room tucked away from the noise.
As she pushed open the door, she saw Alex already inside, rising from his seat the moment he heard her enter.
He greeted her with a familiar, gentle smile.
Sadie’s gaze drifted briefly across the table. Almost every dish laid out was something she liked. Alex hadn’t forgotten. The same old attention to detail.
But that kind of attentiveness wasn’t something she wanted.
She took the seat opposite Alex, careful not to meet his eyes directly.
After a brief pause, she chose to speak plainly. “Mr. Howe, I want to begin by apologizing for what Briley did.” She finally met Alex’s gaze, her expression serious. “She and her father acted without responsibility or restraint. Their actions dragged the Howe family—and you—into a mess you didn’t deserve. I don’t know what their motives were. But surely they had a reason behind fabricating such a story, didn’t they?”
That was the real reason she had agreed to meet. She needed to know what Coyle and Briley had been after. What did they want from Alex?
Alex’s smile faltered, replaced by something bitter. His posture relaxed slightly as he lowered himself back into his seat, his voice quiet when he replied, “It was Briley.”
He recounted the night when Briley had approached him while he was drunk. After that, she had faked her pregnancy to force him to marry her. He spoke as if narrating someone else’s story—detached, controlled.
Sadie lowered her gaze, a pang of guilt tightening in her chest. Briley and her father had gone after Alex not randomly, but with purpose. It was because of the Howe name and his connection to her. In the end, it all traced back to her. Another debt. Another wound.
?: g?.
She looked up, her voice quiet but sincere. “I’m sorry, Mr. Howe. This mess began because of me. I should be the one treating you tonight, not the other way around.”
Alex stared at her across the table, the warmth in his eyes dimming at the formal distance in her words. Her apology, while genuine, felt like a wall. It made him restless. “Sadie,” he said. “Can… can you forgive me?”
Sadie blinked, caught off guard. Forgive him? For what?
Her expression softened with confusion. After a pause, she spoke, her tone steady. “Mr. Howe… you have nothing to ask forgiveness for. If anything, I should be the one apologizing.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 763:noveldrama
She reached into her bag and retrieved a document, carefully laying it on the table between them.
“This is a supplementary agreement between Wall Group and Howe Group’s New Rise Corporation. It’s for the Peterson family’s project.” She met Alex’s eyes briefly before continuing, her tone composed but distant, “Consider it a small compensation from Wall Group.”
She had come prepared.
If she owed a favor, she would repay it cleanly and efficiently—with business, not emotion.
After all, benefits were measurable, emotions were not.
Alex stared at the agreement, the air between them growing heavier by the second. His hands curled into fists atop the table, knuckles whitening.
She was doing it again. Drawing that invisible line with cold professionalism. Rewriting the narrative between them into a mere exchange of debts.
Sadie noticed his silence, the way his posture stiffened. For a moment, she hesitated, something flickering behind her usually unreadable eyes.
Then, as if retreating behind her own defenses, she stood up and offered him a final, polite nod. “I’m sorry, Mr. Howe. I have other matters to attend to. Thank you.”
Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked away, her heels tapping softly against the floor until the door shut quietly behind her.
Outside, the night air was cool as she stepped out of the restaurant. The world felt still, unbothered. But from across the street, hidden in the shadows, someone watched her leave—eyes sharp, filled with cold resentment. It was Briley.
Briley’s hands curled into trembling fists, a storm of resentment swelling inside her. In her mind, every misfortune traced back to Sadie. If not for that woman, she wouldn’t have been cast out of the Wall family—stripped of everything. And Sutton, her older brother, wouldn’t have died.
The weight of it all crushed her, but Briley refused to surrender to despair.
Her eyes flicked toward the VIP room Sadie had just exited.
With no other options left, she made a snap decision. She inhaled sharply, then swung the door open.

Inside, Alex looked up at the sound. He had thought Sadie had changed her mind and returned. His gaze turned icy the moment he saw Briley. His jaw tightened, eyes narrowing in disgust.
“I warned you,” he snapped. “Show up again, and you’ll regret it.”
Briley swallowed hard, forcing herself to keep calm. She needed this.
“Mr. Howe, I know you hate me,” she said with a faint, almost desperate smile. “But if you’re serious about winning Sadie over, hear me out.”
She stepped closer. “Sadie can’t let go of Noah, even after all this time. Ever wonder why she’s still out of reach?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 764:
Alex’s expression darkened, but his curiosity flickered to life.
“What are you getting at?” he demanded.
Seeing she had piqued his interest, Briley felt a surge of hope and quickly laid out her cards.
“The masked man… Patrick Noel. The one always near her? He’s not who you think he is. That’s Noah. He’s alive.”
Alex was stunned, the words ringing in his ears like a detonation.
Patrick was Noah?
It all clicked—the strange familiarity he had felt when he’d seen Patrick at Wall Manor.
So it was Noah. He hadn’t died…
Alex’s eyes lifted slowly.
“You’re suggesting a partnership?” His voice dripped with mockery. “What makes you think you’re even worth aligning with?”
He turned as if to leave, revulsion etched across his face. Spending even a second longer with such a despicable woman would sicken him.
Panic surged through Briley.
She darted in front of him, arms spread. He was her last lifeline.
“Wait! Just listen—please! You want Sadie. My family wants the company back. We can work together! No harm will come to her—we just each take what we need.”noveldrama
She pressed further, her voice rising with urgency.
“You resent Noah, don’t you? Even dead, he had her heart. Now he’s back. Think you stand a better chance?” Her gaze locked onto Alex’s.
“Imagine the fallout if Sadie finds out Patrick is actually Noah. How on earth do you think she’ll react?”
What Briley didn’t know was that Sadie had already uncovered the truth. How naive she was to think she was delivering a bombshell.
“Enough!” Alex suddenly surged forward, his hand locking around her throat.
Ltst chptrs in gαlovels.c?m
The grip was brutal. Briley’s face flushed crimson as she struggled to breathe.
How dare Briley use Sadie to threaten him!
It was as if she had a death wish.
Though Briley was on the verge of passing out, sheer survival instinct kept her hanging on.
“Ending me… changes nothing,” she rasped. “Even if I die, Sadie stays out of reach.”
Alex’s eyes darkened, the malice within them intensifying.
At last, he let go of her, tossing her aside as if she were nothing.
She crumpled to the floor, gasping for air, hands around her neck as violent coughs racked her body.
.

###Chapter 765:
Alex stared down at her, contempt painted across his face.
“Working together? Sure,” he said, his lips curling with derision.
Briley blinked, caught off guard. Just as hope sparked in her chest, his next words struck like ice water.noveldrama
“But you’ll need to show you bring something valuable to the table,” he added coolly, adjusting his sleeve. “I don’t invest in failures. Your family? No influence, no assets, no backing. What could you possibly offer the Howe Group? Partnering with you screams liability.”
With that, Alex turned and exited, not bothering with a backward glance.
Briley remained behind, disheveled and alone.
Still, it wasn’t a total loss—he hadn’t completely refused. That, in itself, was a small win.
After Sadie slid into the backseat of her waiting car and gave a nod to the driver, the vehicle blended seamlessly into the flow of nighttime commuters.
Resting against the headrest, she massaged her forehead. Coyle was now paralyzed following a stroke, Sutton was gone, and Briley had been cast out of the family. That faction posed no immediate threat. Coyle was little more than a relic clinging to the past.
So, what now?
Noah could finally come back home.
But the problem remained—his mind was blank. It was strange. Three years earlier, he had been declared vegetative, and Rosewood Hospital had even issued a death certificate. What really occurred during that gap in time?
Sadie’s instincts pointed toward Hailey as the missing link.
But for now, there was something more urgent—bringing Noah’s memory back. She unlocked her phone and tapped Samuel’s number.
“I need the best neurologists out there,” she instructed crisply. “Internationally. I’m talking pioneers in cognitive recovery with proven results.”
“Understood, Ms. Hudson. I’ll start making arrangements,” Samuel replied without hesitation.
 : ν?﹒
After ending the call, Sadie placed her phone aside.
A sudden wave of queasiness struck her, catching her off guard.
She furrowed her brows and laid a hand over her stomach.
Lately, she hadn’t been feeling like herself—occasional exhaustion, lack of appetite, and now this nausea. Probably just the pressure piling up. She brushed off the thought.
Briley walked out of the restaurant, feeling utterly dejected. A gentle night breeze greeted her, but it somehow felt chilly against her skin.
In a city as big as Jazmah, she came to the sudden and glaring realization that she didn’t have anyone she could rely on.
.
.
.
###Chapter 766:
Briley’s hands clenched into fists so tight, her nails dug into her palms.
This was all Sadie’s fault!
She wouldn’t be in this predicament if it hadn’t been for that despicable woman! There was no way she was going to let this go so easily.
A fierce glint appeared in her eyes as she shot her hand out and hailed a taxi.
“To Jazmah Hopevale Hospital.” Just like that, she was speeding away.
Half an hour later, Briley was striding through the hospital toward Coyle’s room. Her father lay in a pathetic, crooked position on the bed. Half of his body was paralyzed, his lips twisted to one side, and even his eyes were askew. Drool was trickling down steadily from his chin. It was a haunting sight to behold.
His assistant kept vigil, diligently wiping away his drool.
Briley pushed the door open and walked inside, her demeanor devoid of any hint of sympathy.
And why should she be concerned when all Coyle ever cared about was his precious son, Sutton?
Briley waved the assistant away. “You can go now. I need to speak with my dad in private.”
The assistant was visibly relieved, but he offered a respectful bow before exiting the room and closing the door behind him.
Father and daughter were left alone.
Briley approached the bedside, her eyes fixed on Coyle’s gaunt face.
Her nose suddenly stung, and tears fell down her cheeks in quick succession. She threw herself on the edge of the bed, clutching Coyle’s still functional hand.
“Dad,” Briley choked out. “It’s me. I’m here to see you.” She did her best to act weak and helpless. “Dad, what should we do now? We’ve lost Sutton, and you’re in such a dire condition. All of this suffering is Sadie’s fault, that vicious woman! She wasn’t…”
“She’s satisfied with what she’s done to you, so she went ahead and killed Sutton as well!”
Coyle’s murky eyes suddenly widened, and a hoarse, croaking sound escaped his mouth. He wanted to say something, but couldn’t.
? ?  g?ν?
Briley ignored his agitation and carried on with her laments. “I went to say goodbye to Sutton…”
She trailed off on purpose, banking on the pause to make her next words all the more dramatic. “His death was so tragic! He was black and blue with wounds and bruises, and his eyes remained open even when he was dead. I just know he won’t be able to rest in peace! It’s all Sadie’s doing—she hired someone to kill Sutton, then found some nameless woman to take the blame!”
Coyle’s face, already distorted from his stroke, grew even more grotesque. His eyes bulged, his gaze turning ferocious as he stared at the ceiling. His body began to tremble.

###Chapter 767:
His only son, the sole hope of his family—gone, just like that! He believed everything Briley had said. If they didn’t avenge Sutton’s death, the poor lad would never rest in peace!
Briley finally let up and watched quietly as Coyle processed everything she had told him. She smiled to herself in satisfaction, knowing that she was getting the effect she desired.
Moving on with her plans, she wiped her tears and pretended to comfort Coyle. “Don’t worry, Dad. I’ll avenge Sutton, and you.”
She leaned closer and whispered into her father’s ear. “I’ve already made all the necessary arrangements. Next Monday, at the collaboration banquet of Burgess Group and Wall Group, everyone will witness Sadie’s miserable ending! Once Sadie is dead, the Wall Group will be ours again!”
Coyle’s breathing quickened, and his eyes turned wild and crazed.
Yes, Sadie should pay! This wretched woman deserved a brutal end!
Seeing her father’s reaction, Briley plastered a troubled look on her face. “The problem is, I can’t be sure that the people I hired are reliable. If they fail or leave any evidence behind, the repercussions would be even more disastrous.”
She held her breath and waited for Coyle to react. He understood what she was trying to say, of course.
They were going to eliminate Sadie, once and for all, so it had to be a clean hit. They couldn’t afford any loose ends.
But there really wasn’t anything Coyle could do in his current state. He could only entrust their plan to Briley.
He struggled to lift his still-functional hand and pointed a shaking finger at one of the drawers of the bedside cabinet.
“Take…” he started to say, his voice faint and garbled. “Take…”
But it was all Briley needed to hear. She stood and yanked the drawer open.
Inside was an old phone with only one unmarked number in the contact list. Coyle mustered whatever strength he could to rasp out a few more words. “Find… him. Reliable…”
   ? gν?
This person was Coyle’s hidden ace, one that he had kept from his earlier years. The man was ruthless and efficient, and above all, he was absolutely trustworthy.
Briley’s heart skipped a beat as she stared at the number. Her plan had worked! She swallowed the joy and triumph she felt and maintained a worried expression.
She clutched the phone against her chest and nodded. “I understand, Dad. You can leave it all to me. I won’t let you down. I will make sure Sadie pays with her life!”
Time slipped by quickly, and before long, Monday arrived.
The prestigious gala celebrating the renewed partnership between Wall Group and Burgess Group unfolded in the grand ballroom of Jazmah’s most luxurious hotel. Crystal chandeliers bathed the hall in golden light, and the room shimmered with elegance.noveldrama

###Chapter 768:
Sadie stood poised among the sea of elite guests, a vision in her champagne-colored gown—tailored to perfection, hugging her frame with effortless grace. A wine glass rested lightly in her hand as she exchanged polite words with the city’s most influential figures.
But then, her gaze drifted toward the entrance—and froze.
Noah had arrived.
Wearing his signature silver mask, he stood tall, refined, and commanding in presence.noveldrama
And on his arm, Hailey—draped in a pristine white strapless gown—clung to him with adoring affection. They looked like something from a polished fairytale: elegant, radiant, inseparable.
Sadie’s breath caught in her throat.
Her grip on the wine glass subtly tightened, the cold bite of jealousy and pain blooming in her chest.
She had known for some time now that Patrick was Noah—and that Hailey was his current wife.
But knowing something and seeing it were two very different things. And now, with the image burning vividly before her, the truth became inescapable. The bitterness she had so carefully buried clawed its way to the surface.
Across the room, Hailey’s gaze locked with hers—and a slow, calculated smile curled her lips.
She released Noah’s arm with practiced ease. With a gentle smile and graceful poise, she approached Sadie, her wine glass held delicately between her fingers.
Gone was the woman who had acted haughtily in the luxury store—this version of Hailey was poised, warm, and composed.
To anyone watching, it might’ve seemed like a cordial meeting between two refined women for the very first time.
“Ms. Hudson, what a pleasure to meet you,” Hailey greeted with a smile, extending her hand gracefully.
Sadie, despite the storm simmering quietly beneath the surface, returned the smile with perfect poise. Her expression was unreadable as she reached out and gave Hailey’s hand a light shake.
L?t?st ?hρt?rs ιn glov?ls.0
“Ms. Burgess, the pleasure is mine,” she replied coolly.
Hailey’s eyes scanned Sadie with an air of mock admiration, her tone dipped in just the right amount of flattery.
“I’ve heard so much about you. Young, brilliant, and decisive. Seeing you now, I must say, the praise is well-earned. To manage a massive company like Wall Group so flawlessly… I’m truly in awe.”
Then she tilted her head, glancing ever so casually in Noah’s direction, her eyes glinting with subtle triumph. Her next words were laced with gentle mockery, veiled behind sweetness.

###Chapter 769:
“Compared to you, I’m honestly nothing. I don’t understand business at all. I leave all of that to my husband. He insists I don’t trouble myself with anything, and I suppose I’m just spoiled. All I do is stay home and enjoy a life of comfort.”
She gave a small, bashful laugh, her voice growing softer, more saccharine.
“He says I shouldn’t have to lift a finger for anything.”
It was a perfectly crafted jab—each word designed to flaunt her position, her relationship with Noah, and her supposed blissful life—all while wearing the mask of casual conversation.
Sadie’s grip on her wine glass tensed, her fingers going pale around the stem. Yet her expression remained as smooth as still water, her smile no less refined than before.
“Is that so?” she said evenly, her voice light and unbothered, betraying nothing beneath the surface.
Hailey’s smile widened, as if a delightful thought had just occurred to her. Her voice lowered into something more intimate, honeyed with false sincerity.
“Oh, Ms. Hudson, there’s something I almost forgot to mention. Patrick and I are planning to hold our wedding ceremony here soon. And we would be honored if you would attend as our witness.”
The absurdity of it struck Sadie so suddenly, it almost made her laugh.
She looked at Hailey—at that face that mirrored hers too closely. A familiar beauty laced with a foreign smugness, each word calculated, each smile sharpened like a blade. And Sadie understood exactly what Hailey was doing.
Before Sadie could respond, a familiar presence interrupted. Noah.noveldrama
He stepped into the moment like a dark current, his gaze sweeping over both women. There was a subtle tension in his posture—an alertness that hinted he already sensed the tension in the air.
“What are you two discussing?” he asked, his voice quiet but probing.
Hailey turned to him, slipping her hand around his arm with practiced ease. She looked up at him with soft, shining eyes.
“I was just asking Ms. Hudson to be the witness in our wedding.”
  ?: ν?
Noah’s brows furrowed beneath his silver mask.
His gaze moved to Sadie, searching her face, bracing for a reaction—displeasure, pain, indignation. But she gave him none.
Sadie stood perfectly composed, her expression unreadable, her eyes calm. Whatever flicker of emotion might have stirred within her was locked away behind layers of control.
Noah felt a strange, hollow ache in his chest. Something tight and unspoken. Something like… disappointment.
Then Sadie lifted her gaze and met his squarely. Her voice was steady, professional, detached.

###Chapter 770:
“As agreed, Mr. Noel, I’ll be transferring 30% of the shares of Wall Group and giving you the preferential cooperation rights for next year. I’ll have the formal contract sent to your office tomorrow.”
She was drawing the line—with ink, signature, and silence.
Noah said nothing. Behind the mask, his expression was unreadable.
But inside, something coiled tightly in his chest—unspoken, unresolved.
Hailey, oblivious—or perhaps willfully ignorant—of the simmering tension between Sadie and Noah, let her eyes dance between them before flashing a graceful smile.
“Thank you, Ms. Hudson,” she said warmly, accepting on Noah’s behalf, perfectly content to pretend there was nothing beneath the surface.
The air between the three of them, however, told a different story. No one else noticed. But between them, the silence was loud.
Across the ballroom, a man in a black suit moved casually through the crowd, a wine glass in hand, blending in like any other guest.
But his eyes were sharp—focused—and filled with something venomous. His gaze landed on Sadie.
He closed in quietly, one step at a time, like a shadow slipping through light. At his side, his hand dangled loosely, the wine glass a mere prop. Beneath his sleeve, the faintest glint of metal caught the light—a concealed blade, ready.
He was only steps away.
Then—his expression twisted.
The glass slipped from his hand, shattering with a loud crash that drew startled gasps—then chaos. In one fluid motion, he reached into his sleeve, yanking out a dagger, its steel glinting as it flew straight toward Sadie—aimed viciously for her heart.
The attack was sudden, violent, and utterly unexpected. Gasps echoed across the ballroom as panic rippled through the crowd.
Noah reacted instantly—before thought, before reason.
His body moved on pure instinct. He lunged toward Sadie, intent on pushing her out of the way.

But in that split second— Hailey screamed and flung herself at him, clinging tightly to his arm in mock panic, locking him in place.
“Ah! Patrick! I’m scared!”
Hailey’s actions perfectly blocked Noah from intervening.
At the crucial moment, Noah was too late, and the shining dagger was inches from Sadie’s skin.noveldrama
Suddenly, a small figure sprinted from the sidelines.
It was Briley!
She had disguised herself in a server’s uniform and had been watching from the shadows.
.
.
.
###Chapter 771:
At the critical moment, Briley fearlessly jumped in front of Sadie.
The chilling sound of the dagger piercing flesh was unmistakable.
Blood quickly stained Briley’s white uniform.
Sadie stood in shock.
Her eyes widened as she stared at Briley, who had taken the hit for her.
Why was Briley here?
Why would she save her?
Briley’s face grew pale, and she collapsed.
Barely conscious, she lifted her head, gave Sadie a faint smile, and murmured, “Sadie, you’re… you’re okay. That’s what matters.”
With those words, she closed her eyes and lost consciousness.
The room descended into chaos.
Samuel acted quickly, instructing a team of bodyguards to subdue the attacker and secure the weapon.
Sadie, staring at Briley lying in a pool of her own blood, was momentarily paralyzed.
Regaining her senses, she turned to Samuel, urgency in her voice.
“Quick, call 911!”noveldrama
Camera flashes filled the chaotic banquet hall.
Briley lay bleeding, and the attacker was restrained by bodyguards.
Sadie, visibly shaken, took a deep breath to steady herself.
She motioned for Blaine to manage the scene.
She decided to accompany Briley to the hospital.
Briley’s decision to intervene was mystifying.
“Ms. Hudson!”
Feel inspired by gα ?η σ ν s, com
Reporters converged on her, thrusting microphones forward.
“Was that Briley Wall who shielded you just now?”
“Why is she dressed as a server?”
“Does this incident mean the Wall family’s internal disputes are resolved?”
Sadie stopped, facing the press with her composure regained.
“We will issue a statement about tonight’s events later. For now, our focus must be on saving Briley.”
With that, she brushed past the reporters and quickly exited the banquet hall, flanked by her bodyguards.
A car was already waiting. She climbed in and immediately directed the driver, “To the hospital, please.”
As the car blended into the night, Sadie leaned back, her eyes closing softly.
.
.
.
###Chapter 772:
The scene of Briley rushing to her aid and her faint voice echoed in Sadie’s mind.
The question nagged at her: Why would Briley save her?
Soon, the car arrived at the hospital.
Sadie hurried towards the emergency department.
The ominous glow of the red light outside the emergency room set a somber tone.
She paused at the door, her feelings a complex web.
Two hours later, the doors swung open and a doctor in a white coat emerged, looking weary.
He took off his mask, and seeing Sadie by the door, he let out a heavy sigh. “Ms. Hudson, we’ve done everything we could for Miss Wall. She’s stable for now.”
He paused, his expression grave.
“However, the wound was deep, and vital organs were affected. Even though the rescue was timely, she’s likely to suffer serious long-term effects. She’ll need extensive…”
“Rest and ongoing care are essential, and frankly, her recovery looks challenging.” The doctor’s words were a hard truth to accept.
Sadie nodded, her expression unreadable.
“Thank you. Please transfer her to a private room and ensure she has a skilled caregiver at all times. Wall Group will cover all costs.”
Briley’s actions, regardless of her reasons, had been to protect her, and Sadie felt both a rational and emotional obligation to support her.
The doctor acknowledged her instructions and went to make the necessary arrangements.
Just then, Samuel, having dealt with the chaos at the hotel, arrived.
His face was serious as he approached.
“Ms. Hudson,” he began.
Stories live now on galnσ?o
Sadie faced him.
“What have you found?”
Samuel spoke in a low tone. “The assassin isn’t talking, but we’ve made some progress. We found a significant deposit into his bank account just days before today’s incident. The funds came from one of Coyle’s men, someone known for managing his dirty work. It looks like Coyle was behind this.”
This revelation didn’t surprise Sadie.
A cold glint appeared in her eyes, and her lips twisted slightly in disdain. Coyle, even in his weakened state, continued his schemes, stooping to hire a hitman.
Such a despicable man!noveldrama
At this point, any sympathy Sadie might have had for Coyle evaporated.
.
.
.
###Chapter 773:
He deserved no mercy.
“Ensure the assassin will never hurt anyone again. Leave no trace,” she instructed calmly, her voice carrying a frosty edge.
“As for Coyle,” she continued, “send him back to Zupren. Have him watched closely. He’s not to enter the country again without my explicit permission.”
“Understood, Ms. Hudson,” came the reply.
Samuel nodded promptly, his agreement immediate. This decision was already a gesture of goodwill from Sadie, born from family ties.
As he was about to leave, he paused as if recalling something and turned back. “Ms. Hudson, there’s something else,” he added, his tone laden with implication. “The media are buzzing about Miss Wall’s act of bravery—her selfless decision to save you. The coverage is quite touching, and many are applauding her generosity and forgiving spirit. Yet, there’s curious speculation about her attire at the event—why she was in a waitress’s uniform.”
The revelation caught Sadie off guard, her brow furrowing in concern. Briley’s actions had indeed cast her in a sympathetic light, boosting her public image.
Samuel hesitated, then shared more news.
“Moreover, at Wall Manor, the family elders held an urgent meeting and have unanimously decided that Miss Wall epitomizes the Wall family’s ideals because of her recent actions. They’re prepared to welcome her back into the family fold and are interested in your viewpoint.”
Sadie fell silent, weighing her thoughts before exhaling softly.
It was undeniable—Briley had saved her life, an act that not only preserved her own but also reinstated Briley in the Wall family’s good graces.
Despite Briley’s initial intentions, the current circumstances left Sadie with no choice. If she were to block Briley from rejoining the family, it could cast her in a harsh, unkind light, potentially damaging the Wall Group’s carefully maintained reputation.
Thus, Sadie felt compelled to compromise.
“Let’s honor the elders’ decision,” she stated calmly.
’ : ν?
“Understood,” Samuel replied, then left.
Meanwhile, in a plush room at Jazmah Hopevale Hospital, Coyle lay on his bed, his expression tense. Half his face was paralyzed, his eyes misty and turbulent with unease.
He was overwhelmed with anxiety, wondering why he hadn’t received any updates from the person he sent out.
By this point, Coyle had expected the banquet scheme to be a resounding success. Did Sadie die?
He attempted to shift his gaze toward the assistant who stood nearby, barely breathing, head bowed in apprehension.
With a raspy sound from his throat, Coyle signaled to the assistant, who quickly nodded and made to leave the room to fetch news.
.

.noveldrama
###Chapter 774:
Just then, the door swung open forcefully.noveldrama
Samuel strode in, flanked by a cadre of bodyguards clad in stark black suits. Their imposing presence seemed to chill the very air in the room.
The assistant trembled, his legs nearly buckling from fear.
Caught off guard, Coyle stared at the unfolding scene.
Samuel, ignoring Coyle’s strained gaze from the bed, signaled to the bodyguards. “Do it.”
Immediately, two bodyguards advanced and grabbed Coyle.
Outraged and panicked, Coyle managed a weak protest.
“How… how dare you! Samuel, who… who do you think you are? You, just an assistant, dare lay hands on me?!”
His attempt to wield his status was pitiful, undermined by his slurred speech and drooling mouth, stripping him of any semblance of dignity.
Samuel finally met Coyle’s eye, his expression stoic, but his eyes icy.
“At this point, Mr. Wall, pretenses are unnecessary.”
A wave of dread washed over Coyle.
Samuel’s voice was both low and piercing.
“The assassin you dispatched was apprehended immediately. Regrettably for him, he failed to harm Ms. Hudson. Instead, Miss Briley Wall inexplicably intervened to shield Ms. Hudson from the attack, ensuring her safety.”
He paused, watching Coyle’s expression shift to confusion, then continued.
“Ms. Hudson has decreed that you are to be escorted back to your residence in Zupren, barred from ever returning to this country.”
Coyle’s eyes nearly popped from their sockets.
His mouth agape, he struggled for words, but only his ragged breathing filled the silence.
Why would Briley protect that detestable Sadie?
? ?  : g?ν
Wasn’t she supposed to conspire with the assassin for a guaranteed outcome?
No, it wasn’t supposed to unfold like this!
A sudden realization hit Coyle like a thunderbolt.
He understood now.
That cursed Briley!
It was all her manipulation!
She had cunningly staged the entire self-sacrifice!
Using the assassin he had dispatched, she crafted her own scheme to win Sadie’s trust and garner the elders’ compassion!
.
.
.
###Chapter 775:
She had exploited him as merely a pawn in her ascent!
That treacherous daughter!
Despite his years of shrewd maneuvering, Coyle found himself outplayed by his own daughter!
A bitter taste of blood filled his mouth as Coyle shook violently, his eyes fluttering.
His heart seethed with loathing!
Samuel turned away dismissively.
“Take him away.”
The bodyguards didn’t hesitate. They promptly lifted the convulsing Coyle from the bed and dragged him out.
The assistant slumped to the floor, his complexion ashen.
Silence reclaimed the room, leaving a heavy residue of despair.
Meanwhile, in the Howe family’s stately villa, Alex stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his brow creased with concern.
For some reason, he felt uneasy tonight.
The phone on his desk rang abruptly. He picked it up to find his assistant on the line.
“Mr. Howe, there was an incident at the Wall and Burgess Groups’ collaboration banquet.”
Alex’s heart clenched.
He immediately inquired, “How is Sadie?”
The assistant reassured him, “Ms. Hudson is unharmed, Mr. Howe. Miss Briley Wall intercepted a dagger meant for Ms. Hudson and is now receiving emergency care. The assailant, reportedly sent by Coyle, was apprehended.”
Alex listened to the update, a wave of relief washed over him, allowing his tense muscles to relax slightly. Briley had taken a dagger for Sadie?
Alex’s fist clenched, his knuckles whitening.
He had sorely underestimated Briley.
I?t€$? ￠н?ρ?ε ?и glov?l.om
Exiled from the Wall family, she had still orchestrated such a desperate ploy to redeem herself, using this dramatic gesture of self-sacrifice to weave herself back into the Wall lineage.
Such intricate plotting!
Yet, her actions had endangered Sadie!
The mere thought of the peril Sadie had faced chilled his gaze.
No matter Briley’s motives, her actions had jeopardized Sadie, and that was inexcusable.noveldrama
He strode to the coat rack, grabbed his jacket, and hurried out. He had to see Sadie.
In the hospital, Briley regained consciousness and was moved to a standard ward.
.
.
.
###Chapter 776:
Propped up in her hospital bed, she still looked pale, but her demeanor had brightened.
Holding her phone, she browsed the latest online news.
The headlines were sensational, steeped in exaggerated drama.
“Briley Wall Risks Everything to Save Cousin-in-Law—Old Rivalries Set Aside?”
“High-Society Drama Unfolds: Briley Wall’s Life-Threatening Gesture Solidifies Family Ties!”
The comments section buzzed with activity.
A slight smirk played on Briley’s lips.
Despite the pain from the stabbing and the relentless throbbing of her wound, the way the media spun her story—far surpassing her expectations—made the ordeal seem worth it.
She was already plotting her next move.
Suddenly, the hospital room door burst open.
Startled, Briley nearly dropped her phone.
Her eyes shot towards the doorway.
Alex entered, his aura icy, his expression stormy.
Fear gripped Briley, her complexion draining further as she clutched the blanket.
She opened her mouth to speak, but before a word could escape, Alex crossed the room in rapid strides.noveldrama
A firm grip encircled her throat, pulling her abruptly from the bed. Immediately, a crushing sensation of suffocation overwhelmed her.
Alex’s eyes bored into her with undisguised hostility—icy and merciless. Briley’s face turned red, her vision blurring from the lack of oxygen. Driven by survival instincts, she struggled desperately. But her efforts were futile against Alex’s strength.
A hoarse laugh escaped her.
“Alex… kill me? And how would you explain it to Sadie? To the Wall family? I saved her life.”
 : ν?
At her words, Alex’s laugh was cold and mocking. He looked down at her disheveled form, still having the audacity to use Sadie as leverage. The lethal intent in his eyes remained, now mixed with overt scorn.
How dare she bring up Sadie? Briley’s so-called “heroic sacrifice” had actually put Sadie in harm’s way. She had exploited Sadie’s safety as a means to manipulate her way back into the Wall family—a truly despicable act. A flicker of disgust crossed Alex’s face as he abruptly let Briley go, sending her crashing back onto the bed like discarded refuse. Briley crumpled, coughing violently as she grasped her throat.
Alex pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and meticulously wiped his hand, as if he had touched something vile.
.
.
.
###Chapter 777:
He stared down at Briley, his voice icy and piercing.
“Briley, take this as your only warning. If you dare endanger Sadie again or compromise her safety—believe me, you’ll deeply regret it!”
Briley, struggling to regain her breath, listened to his threat. Yet, instead of fear, a slow, unsettling smile crept across her pale face, sending a shiver through the room.
She propped herself up, edging closer to Alex by the bedside. Her voice was raspy.
“How could I? Sadie is my dear cousin-in-law. I would never intend to harm her.” Her tone suddenly shifted, her eyes flashing with a cunning and calculated light.
“And Alex, have you forgotten? Wasn’t it you who challenged me to prove my sincerity? To demonstrate my innocence? That compelled me to take such extreme measures. Technically speaking… we’re in this together.” Alex’s pupils narrowed, his stare intensifying.
How dare she manipulate the facts and implicate him in her plots?
Briley boldly extended her uninjured hand, gently touching his arm.
“Alex, are you pleased with the outcome? I followed your directives exactly. Not only did I clear my name, but I also became a savior within the Wall family. Now, the elders are reconsidering their decision to expel me. My return to the Wall family, reclaiming what I rightfully deserve, seems inevitable.” Alex’s expression darkened, his instincts urging him to pull away.
Briley was clever, ruthless—and now, alarmingly unpredictable.
With her newfound status as Sadie’s savior and the potential for reintegration into the Wall family, any hasty move against her might provoke even more reckless behavior—behavior that could put Sadie at risk.
For now, it seemed prudent to proceed with caution and understand her true intentions.
Alex’s thoughts churned, his face clouded with concern.
After a tense silence, the lethal look in his eyes softened slightly, though his tone remained frosty.
“I hope you keep your word.”
g0ν.′ ?  
He didn’t push Briley’s hand away, tacitly acknowledging her claim. “I’ll arrange for someone to look after you. Make wise choices.”
With those words, Alex turned and exited the room, closing the door firmly behind him.noveldrama
The instant he departed, the smile on Briley’s face vanished, replaced by a steely expression.
She gingerly sat up, her hand pressing against her throbbing wound.
It was painful, but it was worth it.
Alex’s response had confirmed her suspicions.
Sadie was his weak spot. And as long as she could leverage that, she was secure.
.
.
.
###Chapter 778:
Accomplices? It seemed they were, at least for now.
Briley grabbed the phone beside her and fired off a swift command.
“Increase exposure. Bring in additional press coverage. I want the story of me rescuing my cousin-in-law to flood every platform online.”
The following day, a glossy black vehicle glided to a halt in front of Wall Group’s main building.
A crowd of buzzing journalists had already assembled, clearly anticipating a statement.
From inside the car, Sadie peered through the window, her expression tightening.noveldrama
“Take the basement route,” she instructed calmly.
The driver redirected smoothly, steering the car away from the front entrance. Upstairs, the chairwoman’s office basked in warm morning light. Sadie had barely taken her seat when the office door swung open. Blaine stumbled in, looking worn-out and sleep-deprived.
“Sadie!” he groaned, collapsing onto the couch.
“My goodness, last night was insane. I got hounded by calls nonstop!” He rubbed his forehead, clearly overwhelmed.
After a pause, he continued, “By the way, how’s Briley?”
Lifting her cup, Sadie took a measured sip before replying evenly, “She’s fine. Nothing major.”
Blaine exhaled in relief, pressing a hand to his chest. “Thank goodness. If she had died, the press would’ve gone wild. I even saw posts suggesting she should start a showbiz career.” He shook his head, half amazed, half annoyed.
Then, as if remembering something, he sat up straighter.
“Also—the banquet last night? Total disaster. Patrick and Hailey didn’t look pleased. Patrick left on his own, and I had to get Hailey a separate ride.” Sadie’s fingers paused slightly on her coffee cup. Her brow furrowed. The chaos had clearly disrupted the evening’s ive—and left the Burgess Group delegation disgruntled.
Both in terms of business and diplomacy, it needed smoothing over.
g?ν.?n – ?  
“Got it. Have someone assemble a few gifts. I’ll deliver them myself when time allows.”
Blaine nodded. “Understood.”
He gave Sadie a thoughtful glance, inwardly impressed.
Even after everything, she remained composed and precise—never losing her grip on the situation.
Once he exited, stillness returned to the room.
Sadie walked toward the tall windows and gazed out at the crowd of reporters still lingering.
The sunlight was sharp, casting the mass of people as tiny, stubborn shadows.
.
.
.
###Chapter 779:
She didn’t believe for a second that Briley’s so-called sacrifice had been genuine.
And the media storm? It was far too consistent to be organic.
Normally, attention would have faded overnight.
But this narrative was gaining momentum—clearly orchestrated by someone behind the scenes.
Suppressing the coverage would spark suspicion, but letting it escalate could tarnish the company’s image.
A delicate dilemma.
Sadie’s lips curled faintly in ironic amusement.
Since Briley was so invested in putting on a show—and clearly had help—it would be foolish not to make the most of it.
Returning to her desk, she pressed the intercom.
“Samuel, come to my office.”
A knock followed shortly, and Samuel entered.noveldrama
“Ms. Hudson.”
Without looking up, Sadie spoke, her fingers tapping rhythmically on the table.
“Reach out to Starlight Entertainment. I believe they’re currently looking for new faces.”
Samuel paused briefly, and then a flicker of understanding passed through his eyes.
“Yes, ma’am. I’ll handle it right away.”
He didn’t ask questions; he simply bowed slightly and exited.
Sadie gathered her materials, picked up a folder containing a contract, and left. Roughly thirty minutes later, she arrived at a quiet suburban residence. Upon entering, she immediately spotted Hailey slouched on the sofa, dressed casually and looking visibly worn.
The moment Hailey saw her, she sprang up, eyes full of resentment.
Since the night before, Noah had hardly said a word to her. He had kept his distance, cold and detached.
  ? .
She knew exactly why. He blamed her—for holding him back when Sadie was in danger.
Even when facing death, the only person he’d thought to protect… had been Sadie. But how could anyone be sure who the attacker was really after? What if Noah had been the target? Was it so wrong to shield her own husband?
Still, he refused to see it that way. He believed she had done it deliberately.
And all of this was because of Sadie!
Hailey’s breathing quickened. The sight of Sadie standing there—serene, untouched—made fury claw at her chest.
.
.

###Chapter 780:
A sharp smile curled her lips. Her tone was laced with venom.
“Well, if it isn’t the great Ms. Hudson. To what do I owe this surprise? Was your little secret rendezvous with my husband at the hot spring resort not enough? Are you here now to snatch my husband in broad daylight?”
Sadie paused mid-stride, faint amusement flickering in her gaze. This woman really was unhinged.
Sadie’s expression cooled, her voice low and edged with warning. “Ms. Burgess, I suggest you be careful with your accusations.”
Hailey bristled, indignant. “Careful? Which part was not true? Drop the act, Sadie. Can you honestly claim you don’t want my husband?”
Hailey grew increasingly agitated as she spoke, completely shedding the gentle and composed demeanor she usually displayed.
Sadie saw no point in expending energy on a fruitless argument.
Observing Sadie’s silence, Hailey interpreted it as guilt, fueling her anger further.
She let out a cold snort, finding Sadie’s presence unbearable.
Abruptly, she turned and stormed upstairs, slamming the door behind her.
Sadie remained still, her expression calm though her brow furrowed slightly. Just then, a middle-aged woman in a maid’s uniform descended the stairs with a respectful posture.
“Ms. Hudson, Mr. Noel would like to see you in the study,” announced the maid.
Acknowledging with a nod, Sadie ascended the stairs.
She found the study door slightly open.
With a gentle push, Sadie entered.
The room was expansive and luminous, adorned with a subtle grace. A delicate scent of lavender filled the air, awakening deep-seated emotions.
She hesitated briefly.
This scent… Even as Patrick, he preferred it.

Memories flooded her thoughts uncontrollably.
Lost in thought, she didn’t perceive the figure that had stealthily approached.
A tentative yet warm touch grazed her forehead.noveldrama
Startled, Sadie tensed and returned to the present.
Looking up instinctively, she met Noah’s gaze. They were so near, they almost touched.
Today, Noah’s face was unmasked.
The familiar, striking features that haunted her memories were unmistakably before her.
Her heart stuttered, and her breathing paused.

###Chapter 781:
This face… After three years, it remained hauntingly familiar, so much so that, despite his lost memories, her heart raced just from seeing him.
The tension in the air thickened.
A blush spread swiftly across Sadie’s cheeks.
She abruptly turned away, her heart racing as she evaded Noah’s intense gaze. Noah was alarmingly close.
His faint lavender scent mixed with his unmistakable masculine aura disconcerted her.
As Noah observed the blush that tinted Sadie’s ears, his gaze deepened, the memory of touching her soft skin leaving a tingling sensation on his fingertips. He had approached her to ensure she was unharmed after the previous night’s tumult.
Yet, when his fingers brushed her forehead, an undefined emotion surged through him, leaving him unsettled.
He cleared his throat, putting his hand in his pocket as though to erase the moment of contact.
“Did last night leave you unharmed?” he inquired.
Regaining her composure, Sadie made sure her response was even-toned. “I’m fine,” she stated, deliberately avoiding his probing eyes. She redirected the topic to their professional matters. “Mr. Noel, per our agreement, I’ve brought the transfer agreement for thirty percent of the Wall Group’s shares and the contract for preferential cooperation rights over the next year. They’re ready for your examination,” she explained, presenting him with the folder in a strictly professional manner.
Taking the documents, Noah began to review them. Then, Sadie hastened to conclude their meeting.
“The contracts have been delivered, and I must depart now,” she announced. Turning to leave, she was keen to distance herself from the unsettling atmosphere.
However, as she moved to step away, she felt a firm grasp on her wrist. Noah had reached out instinctively, his irritation at her departure mingling with a reluctance to part with her.
Surprised by his sudden pull, Sadie stumbled backward slightly.

A soft gasp left her lips as she toppled directly into Noah’s arms, enveloped by his warmth and the comforting scent of lavender.noveldrama
Noah hadn’t anticipated this turn of events.
As he held her, the delicate warmth of her body against his sparked a profound sense of recognition.
He momentarily froze, feeling as though a dormant part of him had suddenly been revived.
A strange, unidentifiable longing surfaced in his chest.
His embrace involuntarily tightened.
Sadie’s body tensed, her thoughts momentarily wiped clean. Her cheek rested against Noah’s shirt, allowing her to hear the steady thumping of his heart.

###Chapter 782:
Thump… Thump…
Realizing their proximity, Noah quickly regained his composure.
He released her abruptly, stepping back to create distance, a subtle blush coloring his ears.
Clearing his throat, he caught her still-flushed face and maintained a casual tone.
“It’s almost noon. Why don’t you stay for a quick lunch before you leave, Ms. Hudson?”
His invitation came out suddenly and directly.
Sadie looked up, locking eyes with him. Almost instinctively, before she could restrain herself, she nodded.
“Alright.”
Her own response surprised her.
She should have declined immediately. She should have left.
Lunch was served in the formal dining room on the first floor.
The long table was adorned with a lavish spread of dishes, yet the atmosphere was charged despite the elegant setting.noveldrama
Sadie, Noah, and Hailey occupied three distant seats at the table, each silent. Hailey’s face bore a grim expression. Her eyes flickered with animosity as she glanced at Sadie, then she shifted her pitiful gaze to Noah.
But Noah paid her no attention. He ate with a leisurely indifference, treating the woman across from him as if she were merely a stranger—not his wife.
Suddenly, Hailey slammed her fork down on the table.
“I’m full!”
Hailey abruptly stood and rushed upstairs without a glance at either Noah or Sadie, her departure marked by the loud slam of a door.
Standing to the side, Nicolas Patel, the butler, hesitated briefly before shooting Noah a look of unease.
Noah, however, seemed entirely unfazed by the disruption.
M s  s.
His expression unchanged, he calmly dabbed the corner of his mouth with a napkin and issued a composed command.
“Let her be. Ask the kitchen to warm the food later and take it up to her.”
Nicolas nodded briefly. “Yes, sir.”
After a moment, he turned to Sadie and mentioned, “The staff in the kitchen is well acquainted with Ms. Burgess’s preferences.”
Sadie’s grip on her utensils faltered briefly.
Wasn’t Hailey Noah’s wife? Why did the butler treat her like a guest rather than the lady of the house?
Doubt shadowed her thoughts.
.

###Chapter 783:
She raised her eyes to the man across from her, searching for any sign in his demeanor.
But Noah’s face was as unreadable as ever, betraying no hint of irregularity.
Suppressing her confusion, Sadie remained silent.
Perhaps she was reading too much into it.
Their personal matters were, after all, not her business.
Noah then picked up the serving utensils and carefully placed a piece of succulent pot roast on her plate.
“Try this,” he suggested in an even tone. “It’s from Nirvana, the signature dish. The flavor is exceptional.”
Sadie’s eyes narrowed slightly.
Nirvana? That was her favorite restaurant, and pot roast was her constant choice there.
Setting down her utensils, she looked directly at him, her voice steady.
“Mr. Noel, do you also enjoy Nirvana’s cuisine?”
A slight smile touched Noah’s lips—a faint, almost imperceptible curve that carried a hint of warmth.
He met her gaze, his voice soft and deliberate.
“My wife likes it.”
His wife? The title hit Sadie like a thunderclap. Was he referring to her or Hailey? Was it possible that he still remembered that she, his wife, enjoyed Nirvana’s cuisine?
Overwhelmed by a surge of shock and confusion, she found herself unable to think clearly.
She stood up abruptly, the motion tipping over her chair. Without sparing it a glance, she snatched her bag in a rush.
“I—I’ve just remembered something urgent.”
Her voice trembled. She avoided Noah’s gaze.
Read the rest on gl?ν?s?.?o
“I won’t impose any longer. Thank you for the meal.”
With that, she turned and hurried out of the dining room.
Noah’s eyebrows knitted together slightly. Her reaction was… odd.
His eyes fell to the plate of pot roast on the table, his thoughts wandering.
He lifted a piece to his mouth.
The meat was tender and flavorful—rich but not overly fatty. It truly was a superb dish.
He clearly remembered his wife had once confessed her love for this dish from Nirvana.noveldrama
That was precisely why he had requested it be prepared today.
.
.
.
###Chapter 784:
Was Sadie’s abrupt departure because she disliked the dish?
Then it struck him.
That was Sadie. His wife… was Hailey. Wasn’t it?
Noah’s expression grew pensive, his features tightening.
Meanwhile, Sadie had dashed from the villa.
She jumped into her car, slammed on the accelerator, and drove rapidly away from the estate.
As the landscape whipped by, her mind remained a whirlwind of emotion.
What had transpired in the past three years? Why had Noah lost his memory? Why did he confuse Hailey with the woman he once loved? Why did some memories linger while her face remained unrecognized?
She was desperate for answers.
As she pondered, her phone, lying on the passenger seat, began to ring.
It was Samuel on the line.
Taking a deep breath to quell the rising tide of emotions, she pressed the answer button.
“Ms. Hudson,” Samuel’s voice came through, always steady and professional.
“Starlight Entertainment has dispatched representatives to the hospital to meet with Briley. They’ve arrived with a professional management team and legal advisors. Their approach seems quite sincere.”
Sadie listened without emotion. This was precisely what she had expected.
Briley had engineered this drama to garner both fame and fortune.
The entertainment industry, a realm fueled by ambition and vanity, was a perfect fit for her.
“Excellent,” she responded evenly. “Let them handle the remainder. We shouldn’t intervene further.” Briley had chosen her path.noveldrama
“Yes, Ms. Hudson.”
Freshly uploaded on gα?ησv?s?com
Ending the call, Sadie tossed her phone back onto the passenger seat.
The afternoon sun blazed through the car window.
She squinted slightly, focusing on the road ahead.
Regardless of past events, she was resolute in uncovering the truth.
She would reclaim what was rightfully hers.
And those who had wronged her would not escape her wrath.
Meanwhile, in the hospital, Briley lay bewildered on the bed, eyeing the unexpected throng in her room.
A middle-aged man, impeccably dressed and radiating competence, stood at the forefront.

###Chapter 785:
Reporters, cameras, and microphones in hand, hovered behind him.
What was happening?
The man introduced himself as Leonard Juarez from Starlight Entertainment, greeting her with a bright, enthusiastic smile. “Miss Wall, I’ve heard so much about you!”noveldrama
Leonard extended his hand warmly, but Briley remained still.
Unfazed, Leonard smoothly withdrew his hand, his eyes lingering on her face.
“Miss Wall, your beauty and elegance are truly extraordinary! Moreover, your act of saving your cousin-in-law was nothing short of heroic! We, Starlight Entertainment, recognize immense potential in you. We would be thrilled to sign you and help you make your name in the entertainment industry.”
Instantly, the reporters pivoted their cameras toward Briley, their flashes firing relentlessly. It felt as though she was under an interrogation lamp.
Briley’s heart sank. Who was she? She was a distinguished member of the Wall family! And now, they expected her to become an entertainer? How demeaning! Yet, as she surveyed the scene before her, it was clear that Starlight Entertainment had come thoroughly prepared.
If she rejected them outright, what kind of headlines would follow? By tomorrow, the media might be plastered with titles like “Briley Wall’s Cowardly Retreat from Contract Sparks Doubts Over Her Heroic Act?” The reputation she had painstakingly built could be tarnished.
Beneath the blanket, her fingers clenched into a fist, but she kept a poised smile on her face.
“Mr. Juarez, you are too kind. I merely did what was necessary. As for entering the entertainment industry…” She paused deliberately, allowing a trace of hesitation to surface.
Leonard, ever astute, quickly interjected, “Miss Wall, you deserve all the acclaim! Your popularity is skyrocketing! You’ve already amassed a significant online fan base, all of whom are eagerly awaiting your debut. If you sign with us, we promise unparalleled resources to nurture your talent. You are destined to be our brightest new star.”
A sudden realization dawned on Briley. She now had fans, people who admired and supported her. If she entered the industry and garnered a strong following, could she leverage that influence to shape public opinion? Perhaps even influence the decisions of the Wall Group? Once this thought took root, it lingered persistently.
Becoming an entertainer suddenly didn’t seem so ionable.
The uncertainty in Briley’s face gradually faded, replaced by a strategic, gentle smile.
“I appreciate your confidence in me, Mr. Juarez. Given the excitement surrounding my debut, I’m willing to give it a try.”
A spark of satisfaction lit up Leonard’s eyes as he clapped his hands.
“Outstanding! Miss Wall, your decisiveness is commendable!”
He quickly fetched a prepared contract from his assistant and presented it to Briley.
.

###Chapter 786:
“Miss Wall, please review this. If it meets your approval, we can finalize it right now.”
Briley scanned the document.
The terms were indeed tempting. Without hesitation, she took the pen and signed her name at the bottom.
Leonard’s face lit up with a smile, and he turned to the gathering of reporters.
“Ladies and gentlemen, as of this moment, Miss Briley Wall is officially a part of Starlight Entertainment! We ask for your unwavering support!”
The cameras began flashing incessantly once more.
Online forums soon buzzed with headlines like “Briley Wall’s Official Debut,” accompanied by waves of supportive comments.
“Wow! Briley is really stepping into the spotlight? So excited!”
“Beautiful and benevolent—supporting Briley all the way!”
Briley browsed through the accolades, her lips curving into a triumphant smile. However, that smile quickly faded within days.
Since the announcement of her debut, reporters had been swarming for exclusives.
Initially, she managed to handle it patiently. Yet, the throng outside her ward swelled with each passing day.
One afternoon, as another uproar broke out outside, Briley’s expression soured with irritation. She turned to the two bodyguards by the door.
“This is absurd! Get rid of them!”
The bodyguards hesitated but ultimately complied, unable to defy her command.
They stepped outside, attempting to diffuse the situation.noveldrama
“Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize. Miss Wall is unwell and requires rest. Please return at another time.”
Despite the announcement, the reporters remained relentless. With interest at its peak, everyone was clamoring for an exclusive.
Spotting an opening, a young reporter darted forward, attempting to bypass the guards.

One bodyguard, acting on instinct, extended his arm to block the reporter.
The force was excessive.
The reporter stumbled, lost his balance, and fell hard to the floor. His forehead struck the ground with a sickening thud, and blood began to seep from the wound. A stunned silence enveloped the scene for a moment. Then, pandemonium broke out.
“Briley’s bodyguard just assaulted a reporter!”
“Oh my God, there’s blood!”
“Barely debuted, and she’s already a diva?”
As a scandal loomed, the other reporters pressed forward, their cameras flashing incessantly. Online, the narrative shifted quickly.
.
.
.
###Chapter 787:
Hashtags like #BrileyWallBodyguardAssault and #BrileyWallDivaBehavior began to dominate, quickly overshadowing any prior accolades. Briley, seeing the headlines, was momentarily speechless.
Then, anger surged within her—she was furious at the bodyguards.
“Idiots! Absolute fools! You’ve ruined everything!”
The bodyguards stood in silence, their heads bowed.
Briley paced anxiously.
She couldn’t remain in the hospital any longer; she needed to be discharged.
But how would she handle the media outside?
Then, an idea occurred to her.
“Leak this to the reporters—make it seem like an accident, of course. Let them know that I was seriously injured while saving my cousin-in-law and that I’ve been hospitalized for days. Yet, my dear cousin-in-law, Sadie—the chairwoman of Wall Group—hasn’t visited me. She hasn’t shown any concern.”
A sly smile crossed her face.
If her path wasn’t going to be easy, she would ensure Sadie’s wasn’t either.
She was determined to expose just how cold and ungrateful Sadie truly was.
Briley yanked a thick bundle of bills from her purse and shoved it into one of her bodyguard’s hands.
He tested its weight with greedy fingers, his lips curling into a satisfied grin. Cash spoke its own language.
He gave a quick nod. “Rest assured, Miss Wall. Consider it handled—quiet and completely untraceable.” Briley gave a pleased nod in response.
On the top floor of Wall Group, Sadie had just concluded a board meeting. As she exited the meeting room, she massaged her forehead.noveldrama
Samuel walked close behind, his face set in a grim line.
“Ms. Hudson.”
Latest stories on gα?ησvs?com
Without pausing, she tilted her head slightly.
“Go on.”
In a hushed tone, Samuel informed her, “There’s been a situation at the hospital. Briley’s bodyguard clashed with a reporter, pushed him down, and injured him. Social media is buzzing with outrage over Briley’s behavior, and her reputation is spiraling.”
Sadie halted briefly, unfazed. She had expected something of the sort. Briley never handled adversity quietly. With a resigned shake of her head, she replied coolly, “Understood.” This was Briley’s mess.
Samuel hesitated before continuing, “That’s not all. A new angle is trending—people are saying Briley shielded you from an attack, got badly hurt, and yet, as her cousin-in-law and head of Wall Group, you haven’t shown up at her bedside. They’re accusing the family of neglect—of abandoning someone who risked her life for you.”
.
.

###Chapter 788:
Sadie came to a stop. Was Briley really reaching this far? Her manipulations were laughably obvious.
Sadie let out a cold chuckle, pushed open her office door, and walked in.
“Noted.”
She hadn’t even settled into her chair when the door burst open. Marshall Chadwick, head of PR, stormed in, drenched in sweat and visibly rattled.
“Ms. Hudson! We’ve got a serious problem!”
Sadie raised her eyes, frowning faintly. “What is it now?”
Still catching his breath, Marshall fumbled with his tablet and then played a video. “You have to watch this—Briley just held a press briefing.”
Onscreen, Briley, who had quietly slipped out of the hospital, appeared in a hospital gown, her complexion pale and her frame gaunt—an image of fragile sorrow.
“Dear media friends, thank you for your concern. I deeply regret the altercation caused by my team. The fault lies with me—I failed to manage them properly.” With that, she gave a long, solemn bow.
Then, seamlessly, she addressed the swirling rumors about Sadie’s absence. “As for those saying my cousin-in-law, Sadie, never came to visit…” Briley sniffled. Perfectly timed, a lone tear traced down her cheek.
“Please don’t judge her. She leads a massive enterprise—it’s natural she’s pressed for time. Besides, my brother and I have hurt her deeply before. It’s only fair that she keeps her distance. Sadie and others from the Wall family have shown me nothing but kindness over the years. I truly mean it.” As she spoke, she dabbed at her eyes repeatedly.
That expression—enduring pain with dignity—would tug at anyone’s heartstrings. Anyone watching would think she had suffered unimaginable injustice, yet was still defending Sadie.noveldrama
Predictably, the online comments were merciless.
“Wow! Sadie is made of stone! Briley saved her and gets nothing in return?”
“She runs Wall Group? What a cold, heartless exec.”
“Ungrateful! Heartless!”
“Shameful! Briley defends her despite being treated like this?”
“It’s always the kind ones who suffer the most.”
“Family exclusion at its peak!”
The wave of insults was relentless.
Marshall, visibly sweating, looked on edge. “This is a PR disaster, ma’am! Should we issue a statement to clear things up right away?”
Sadie watched the clip without any visible reaction. As she returned the tablet, her face was calm—bordering on amused.
.
.
.
###Chapter 789:
Briley had made a clever move. But she had miscalculated her rival.
Leaning back, Sadie tapped the desk lightly.
“No need for press releases. I have a better strategy.”
Marshall gaped. “You what? But—”
“You can return to your work,” she said coolly, her gaze already elsewhere. Marshall hesitated, wanting to protest, but ultimately didn’t dare. He left, his stomach twisting with unease.
As the office door closed, Sadie turned to Samuel.
“Contact the elders of the Wall family. Tell them the Wall Group needs continuity at the top. Briley’s act of bravery has earned public sympathy. I feel unworthy—ashamed even. I’m stepping down. Let her take the reins.”
Samuel was stunned for a moment. What was Ms. Hudson planning?noveldrama
Then the pieces fell into place—and admiration lit his eyes.
A tactical retreat… for a greater comeback.
If Briley wanted the spotlight, Ms. Hudson could steal the whole stage.
Ms. Hudson’s move was absolutely brilliant!
“Right away, Ms. Hudson!”
At the press conference lounge, Briley lounged on the plush sofa, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth. Her recent tearful performance in front of the cameras had been flawless. The reporters had looked on with sympathy. By now, she was sure public opinion had shifted entirely. That detestable Sadie was probably being criticized online. She deserved it!
Sadie had it coming for stealing everything that should have been hers. The more Briley dwelled on it, the more her satisfaction grew. She could already picture the day she would take over the Wall Group and how she would “repay” Sadie.
Suddenly, the ring of her phone jolted her from her thoughts. Briley scowled at the disruption. An unknown number. Who could it be? Terrible timing. She was in too good a mood to deal with this nuisance.
Briley quickly pressed the disconnect button. But the phone rang again within seconds, persistent. Still calling?
Briley lost patience, her expression souring as she grabbed the phone. “Hello? Who is this? Can’t you take a hint?”

After a moment of silence, an elderly voice, heavy with anger, erupted. “Briley! How dare you!”
That voice! Briley froze, her pupils narrowing. It was Jonah Wall, an elder of the Wall family!
She had overlooked these old guardians.
Springing from the sofa, she nearly knocked over a glass of water in her haste. Her voice shaky, she attempted a smile. “Granduncle Jonah? Oh, it’s you! I’m so sorry! I didn’t realize…”
.
.
.
###Chapter 790:
The icy tone from the other end interrupted her. “Enough of this nonsense! Come to the meeting hall at Wall Manor immediately! You have one hour. If I don’t see you…”
“By then—starting tomorrow, you’re out of the Wall family!”
Click. The call ended abruptly.
Briley stood still, clutching the phone, her mind racing.
The meeting hall? Why this sudden summons? And the threat of disownment? What had she done to provoke such a reaction? Could her press conference have infuriated those old guardians?
But she had only spoken to protect the Wall family’s reputation, to defend that despicable Sadie. Were they really so blind?
Resentment surged within her, but it was quickly overshadowed by a deeper fear.
The Wall family elders, especially Jonah, wielded absolute power.
If they decided to cast her out, they could very well do so.
But she had worked too hard to rise to where she was now.
Briley inhaled deeply, steadying her nerves.
She wasn’t the vulnerable person she used to be.
She had saved Sadie, gained fans, and garnered public support.
Even if these stubborn old men were upset, what could they really do to her?
At worst, they would scold her. That had to be all.
Reassured by the thought, her anxiety began to fade.
She straightened her attire, refreshed her lipstick, and regained her composure.
She was intrigued—what were these old-timers planning this time?
With her head held high, Briley confidently walked out of the lounge in her high heels.
Upon entering the meeting hall at Wall Manor, she immediately sensed the oppressive tension.
Complet3 c0nt3nt at glnovels.
The Wall family elders, all clad in somber formal attire, lined the room in stern silence.
At the forefront, Jonah’s expression was stormy.
“Get down on your knees.”
Briley hesitated. She was a rising star now. Being seen kneeling here would be humiliating.noveldrama
She adopted a distressed expression, her voice soft and pleading.
“Granduncle, I have an injury. The doctor advised against any strenuous activity or putting pressure on the wound. If I kneel and it reopens—and if the reporters outside find out—it could disgrace the entire Wall family.”
Her words caused Jonah’s face to flush with anger. Did she still care about the family’s reputation?
Without another word, he raised his cane—and struck her sharply on the knee.
.
.
.
###Chapter 791:
“Ah!”
Briley hadn’t anticipated that he would actually strike her. She staggered and fell to her knees.
She couldn’t believe this old man had dared to hit her.
The other elders shook their heads and sighed.
They believed Briley was blinded by her greed and ambition.
Her statements at the press conference might have seemed noble, but they were designed to ensnare Sadie.
Just then, the heavy wooden doors of the meeting hall creaked open.
A calm, composed voice floated in.
“I, Sadie Hudson, voluntarily resign as the head of the Wall family and as chairwoman of the Wall Group.”
Everyone turned to look.
Sadie, dressed in a simple white dress, entered with poised authority. Behind her, a throng of reporters with cameras and microphones followed.
The elders’ faces fell.
Briley tensed, her heart sinking with a deep sense of foreboding.
Unperturbed by the charged atmosphere, Sadie walked to the center of the hall.noveldrama
Her gaze calmly swept over the elders.
Then, she slowly knelt down beside Briley.
“I’ve fallen short in my responsibilities to this household, and for that, I extend my sincerest apologies to everyone present.”
Sadie’s tone was steady—not overpowering, yet not faint—but it resonated clearly through the press microphones, heard by all in attendance.
“Briley sustained a severe injury while protecting me. She came close to death. The guilt has been unbearable; I haven’t had a peaceful night since. The whispers circulating outside all stem from my actions. They’ve brought dishonor to our family name and added to Briley’s pain. I no longer feel capable or worthy of remaining as the family’s leader or the company’s chair. I humbly request the elders to accept my resignation from every post, so I may retreat, reflect, and pray for Briley’s recovery.”
With that, Sadie bowed low before the council of elders.
? ? : ?ν﹒
Briley observed with an inner spark of glee.
What an idiot! She was really stepping down—and in full view of the media! That role was practically hers now.
Quickly masking her excitement, she put on a facade of worry. She turned swiftly to Jonah, her tone carefully pitched with urgency.
“Granduncle! Since Sadie has chosen to relinquish her authority, we cannot leave the Wall Group leaderless—not even for a day, nor can the family remain without guidance. I’m ready to shoulder her responsibilities. I offer myself, wholeheartedly, to carry this burden and serve the family with devotion!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 792:
Jonah, already shaken by Sadie’s bombshell and the prying eyes of the media, flared with fury at Briley’s bold declaration. His anger surged as he turned to glare at Briley.
Was this girl truly that clueless? Did she think this was the right moment to be reckless?
Did she think leadership was a prize anyone could claim at a moment’s notice? Had she forgotten how her father, Coyle, nearly dragged the entire family legacy into ruin? Half the family’s heritage was almost lost because of him. Entrusting such enormous power to her—someone impulsive, reckless, and selfish—would be beyond foolish.
They’d have to be out of their minds to agree!
Jonah’s blood pressure surged, his vision briefly clouding.
Fighting the urge to lash out, Jonah turned away from Briley and stepped forward to help Sadie rise, his voice hoarse with emotion.noveldrama
“Sadie, please… don’t kneel on the cold floor. If something’s troubling you, speak up! We’ll support you no matter what. The leadership of the Wall family and the position at the helm of Wall Group have always belonged to your branch of the family. This rule has been honored for generations, and no one has the authority to change it. You can’t step down—under no circumstances!” Jonah’s voice cracked, and his eyes brimmed with tears.
Briley listened, her grin stiffening.
Why was Sadie getting all the sympathy and backing? She was the one who had suggested stepping away! Why did it suddenly feel like she was the victim?
Were these elders completely oblivious?
Briley’s hands balled into fists.
Following Jonah’s words, Sadie slowly rose. Her gaze was tinged with sorrow, and a faint, strained smile touched her lips—an expression that tugged at the heartstrings.
“Granduncle,” she said softly, “it’s not that I wish to walk away from my responsibilities, but…”
She paused and exhaled, her tone heavy with fatigue.
“Briley has just begun her journey. Her path holds immense potential. But there are always those who twist the truth—spreading lies online, stirring speculation about our relationship, and even dragging the Wall family name through the mud. They’ve accused me of treating Briley unfairly, of being ungrateful. But I am deeply appreciative of her sacrifice. I mean… how could I not be grateful to her? How could I not trust her? I’ve brought in top-tier nutritionists and ensured she receives the finest care to aid her recovery. But…” Sadie hesitated, a flicker of pain shadowing her expression.
  ? : g?ν
“But the slander, the cruel words, the endless public scrutiny—I can’t take it anymore. I worry that my presence will cast a shadow over Briley’s potential, and worse, damage the Wall family’s longstanding reputation. So, I ask you to allow me to step down as head of the family and chairwoman. Perhaps, by doing so, things will quiet down.” Her voice was calm yet firm, carrying the weight of someone ready to give up everything for the sake of others.
.
.
.
###Chapter 793:
Jonah felt like his heart was being ripped apart. How much must she have endured in silence?
Briley was clearly the one stirring unrest, yet Sadie was the one offering to take the fall to restore peace? It was absurd. If Sadie truly left, who would lead Wall Group? Briley? That airhead? The entire corporation would crash within months!
And the family? Would they really hand the reins over to Briley—that scheming opportunist?
Overwhelmed, Jonah stomped the floor in frustration, his voice rising with anguish.
“No! This cannot happen!”
Both inside the hall and beyond its walls, reporters quickly pieced together the emerging narrative.
Only hours earlier, Briley’s display at the press conference had shaped public opinion—casting Sadie as cold and unfeeling. But with the latest revelations, that opinion crumbled.
The real manipulator was Briley, who had cunningly stirred public emotion to corner Sadie. Her so-called noble gesture might have had some truth to it, but her intentions were now glaringly transparent.
The atmosphere shifted. Reporters now regarded Briley with disapproval, whispers spreading like wildfire.
“So that’s what really happened. Briley’s behavior is downright disgraceful.”
“Hard to believe—pulling moves like this at the beginning of her public career? She must be desperate for recognition.”noveldrama
“Ms. Hudson has been through so much. Her husband passed away three years ago. She’s cared for an ill mother-in-law, raised a child on her own, and still kept Wall Group thriving. That’s not easy!”
“Exactly. Under her leadership, the company hasn’t just stayed afloat—it’s grown stronger. Everyone can see it.”
“And now, her cousin-in-law is forcing her out? That’s cruel.”
In that moment, realization hit Briley like a punch to the gut.
mr ρdaes ? anovels.cm
She scanned the hall—the cameras, the lights, and then Sadie, poised and graceful as ever.
This had been orchestrated by Sadie from the start. From the moment Briley had painted herself as the victim, Sadie had been planning.
That conniving witch!
As if sensing the intensity of Briley’s stare, Sadie turned slightly. Their eyes met, and Sadie’s slight smirk seemed to say, “You’ve been outplayed.”
Heat surged through Briley’s veins, clouding her thoughts. Anger flared dangerously, threatening to boil over.
Her hands trembled, itching to wipe the smug grin off Sadie’s face. That despicable woman—how could she be so brazen?
.

###Chapter 794:
Then, Sadie’s voice cut through the haze, calm but edged with menace.
“Briley, you might want to reconsider your next move. The press is watching closely. If this turns into tomorrow’s headline, the fallout won’t be in your favor.”noveldrama
Her words struck Briley like a splash of cold water. The reporters, the flashing lenses, the endless spectators—it would all be documented. A single misstep could ruin everything.
She had toiled for days to restore her public persona. She couldn’t throw it all away now.
Jaw clenched, Briley forced herself to swallow the bitterness rising in her throat. Head lowered, she masked the fury burning in her eyes, though her limbs quaked under the strain.
This moment—she wouldn’t forget. One day, Sadie would pay for it all. With interest.
Finally, Jonah seemed to come out of his daze. His eyes flicked between the two women—each with her own agenda—and realization struck.
Sadie might have suffered injustice, but her retaliation had been swift and surgical. As for Briley… naive to a fault. And she thought she could lead the family empire? Not a chance.
Clearing his throat, Jonah leaned on his cane and faced the lingering press, his tone unwavering.
“I’d like to make something crystal clear for our friends in the media. Sadie has repeatedly demonstrated her loyalty and competence. There is no doubt—leadership of the Wall Group is hers. Our family stands together. Speculations of infighting are baseless.”
He took a breath, his expression softening.
“As for Briley—while we welcome her back into the Wall family, her decision to pursue a life in entertainment deserves her full attention. As of today, she will step down from all responsibilities within the Wall Group. Her previously assigned shares will be temporarily suspended, and she will not be the chairwoman of Wall Group.”
Reporters burst into applause.
“Well said! The Wall family knows how to maintain order!”
Full ztory availabl3 at glnovels.
“Exactly! Let her chase stardom—leave the business to capable hands.”
“Ms. Hudson truly earned her place!”
Briley was stunned to her core. After everything—every plan, every sacrifice to maintain her facade—this was her reward? Not only had she failed to bring Sadie down, but she had also been stripped of everything that mattered. She had lost! She had lost so completely!
Sadie took in the devastation carved into Briley’s face, her own gaze steady and composed. She stepped closer and gently took Briley’s arm.
“Don’t be sad, Briley. If you ever need anything, you know where to find me. I’m always willing to lend a hand.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 795:
Briley mustered a tight smile. With all the cameras rolling, she had no choice but to play along.
“Thanks for your kindness, Sadie.”
As the atmosphere calmed, the reporters began trickling out. Gradually, the family elders also exited, leaving behind a once-bustling hall now drenched in stillness. Sadie let go of Briley’s hand.
The moment she pivoted to leave, Briley’s restraint gave way entirely. In a sudden outburst, Briley lunged, her palm slicing through the air toward Sadie’s cheek. “You vile witch!”noveldrama
But Sadie moved with razor precision. Her gaze turned icy as she intercepted the attack, seizing Briley’s wrist and flinging it aside with swift force. Briley lost balance and crashed awkwardly to the floor.
“I’d tread carefully if I were you,” Sadie murmured, her tone dangerously calm. “You wouldn’t want to end up like Coyle.”
Briley’s pupils contracted in shock, her body involuntarily trembling. Though rage twisted her features, her mouth stayed shut.
Sadie didn’t spare her another second—she turned on her heel and headed out, slipping into the car waiting outside.
Briley stayed on the frigid floor, shaking with fury. Her fists clenched, and her mind echoed with one thought: Sadie would pay for this. And for what happened to her brother, vengeance was inevitable.
In the vehicle, Samuel swiveled in his seat, shooting Sadie a thumbs-up. “Your tactic of playing the underdog worked flawlessly, Ms. Hudson. The narrative is now in our favor, and Briley can no longer work in Wall Group. She’ll be too busy putting out PR fires to stir up more chaos.”
Sadie exhaled and massaged her temples, her face unreadable. Briley had only been the beginning.
“What’s the update on the investigation of the doctors?”
At that, Samuel’s expression turned serious. He handed her a tablet.
I€$? ￠tя? ?η ga?n?νεl?.c
Sadie scanned the display—neurology, cognitive repair, top-tier practitioners… Her gaze halted on a name: Hailey Burgess. As detailed in the document, Hailey had earned a reputation as the foremost global authority on cognitive recovery.
The others listed were either completely obscure or had their records so tightly guarded that they couldn’t be accessed. Sadie’s stomach dropped.
Samuel chimed in, “Ms. Burgess left Rosewood Hospital in Zupren three years ago. That’s why some of her files have been declassified. However, Rosewood Hospital is renowned for its strict confidentiality measures. If you’re trying to identify other physicians connected to Mr. Noel’s case, you’ll probably need to travel to Zupren directly.”
Three years ago? Hailey had practiced medicine at Rosewood Hospital? Was that when she first crossed paths with Noah?
.
.

###Chapter 796:noveldrama
Sadie felt as if she were slowly lifting veils—each step revealing a glimpse of something hidden beneath.
Back at Wall Group, she moved listlessly through the building, her thoughts elsewhere. Eyes lowered, she didn’t notice the person waiting beside the elevator until it was too late.
She walked straight into a firm chest, warm through the fabric.
The sudden jolt left her momentarily dazed. She instinctively stepped back—but a gloved hand, strong and sure, caught her waist and held her steady.
The crisp, bold fragrance of lavender hit her, one she knew all too well. Her body stiffened. She glanced up quickly—only to be met by a silver mask, concealing everything except a pair of piercing, unreadable eyes.
It was him. Patrick. What was he doing here?
Noah had reacted without thinking the instant she ran into him. The figure in his arms was slight, delicate… eerily familiar.
She seemed disconnected, like her mind was miles away.
Sadie blinked in surprise, then drew back suddenly as though scalded. She took a couple of quick steps in retreat.
Her chest fluttered with nerves, and warmth colored her cheeks.
She coughed lightly, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear.
“Mr. Noel? What brings you here?”
Noah’s gaze grew intense when he noticed the faint blush on Sadie’s ears. He withdrew his hand and slid it back into his pocket, a subtle smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
“I saw the news online. You truly are sharp and capable, Ms. Hudson.” There was an ambiguous quality to his tone, and Sadie couldn’t quite tell whether his words were meant as praise or criticism.
Noah had indeed seen the news, and he thought the dramatic turn of events had been spectacular. Sadie was far more resilient than he had thought. More than that, she seemed to have the skills and the guts to turn just about any situation to her advantage. However, looking at her now, he noticed she didn’t have the triumphant demeanor he had been expecting.
After hesitating for a few seconds, Noah said, “I came here to discuss another matter with you.”
?   : ?ν.
Sadie nodded and brushed off the tumultuous thoughts that had been plaguing her. It was just as well that Noah wanted to talk business.
Sadie gestured for Noah to follow her. “This way to the meeting room, Mr. Noel.”
The first thing Sadie did upon entering the room was pour a glass of water and place it in front of him.
Noah’s eyes narrowed slightly. He had noticed her distraction, not to mention the fact that her usually bright eyes were now clouded with what appeared to be sadness. Something must be weighing on her mind.
.
.
.
###Chapter 797:
For some reason, that thought made his chest tighten. He had a vague feeling that she was hiding something from him, and he didn’t like it.
Noah gingerly took his seat.
“The Burgess Group is considering the idea of relocating part of our production line. The plan is to build a local factory to better serve the domestic market. Since we now share a strong partnership, I thought it would be best to ask for your input regarding the site selection.”
Sadie fixed her eyes on the glass of water as he spoke, absently twirling a pen with one hand.
She heard his words, but her mind struggled to process them.
Build a factory? Site selection?
The words echoed distantly, her mind still caught on the information Samuel had given her earlier.
The pieces were starting to fall into place, painting a possibility that Sadie wasn’t ready to accept.
When a moment passed and she still hadn’t said anything, Noah frowned.noveldrama
He leaned over the table, waving a hand in front of her face. “Ms. Hudson?” His proximity snapped Sadie back to reality, though her eyes remained glassy for a couple of seconds before they finally focused on his.
She belatedly realized her rude behavior and felt her cheeks warm with embarrassment.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Noel. I was just—”
She was cut off when a large, cool hand pressed against her forehead.
Sadie froze, instinctively trying to pull away, but Noah’s other hand gripped her shoulder firmly.
His calloused fingertips lingered on her skin, and the familiar, calming scent of lavender grew more pronounced as he closed the distance between them. His touch was gentle, yet steady. Noah took a moment to feel her temperature; it was normal.
She wasn’t ill, but her actions suggested something was troubling her.
€?? ￠?αt?εяs 1n ga?n?νεl?.
Noah finally drew back, his tone softening as he met her flustered gaze. “It doesn’t look like you have a fever. Is something bothering you? Does it have to do with recent events?”
Unbeknownst to him, these questions only intensified Sadie’s unease.
A wave of bitterness rose in her heart, but more than that, she felt a keen sense of defiance.
She forced an obviously fake smile onto her face. “No, I’m fine. You were talking about site selection?”
She quickly steered the conversation back on track, eager to dispel the awkward atmosphere. “An industrial plot in the east of the city will be up for public auction in a few days. Its location and land area are ideal for what you have in mind. I’ll have Samuel gather the details and send them to you later.”
.

###Chapter 798:
Noah gave her a long, lingering look.
Noah gave her a thoughtful look. He knew she was diverting the topic, but ultimately decided not to press further.
If she didn’t want to talk, then he couldn’t very well force her.
Still, a part of him couldn’t let the matter go.
Noah cleared his throat and nodded. “All right.”
Sadie’s relief was immediate, and painfully clear on her face. She shot to her feet. “In that case, I’ll let you get back to work, Mr. Noel. I have some things to take care of myself.”
She wanted nothing more than to leave, to distance herself from the man who caused her so much inexplicable distress.
She needed time alone to sort through the tangled mess that was her mind. Sadie was already walking to the door when Noah spoke, stopping her in her tracks. “Wait.”
Sadie turned on her heel to look at him.
Noah had already risen and was approaching her. “Let’s have dinner tonight.” It wasn’t a question. Barely an invitation. No, it was a statement, leaving her no room to refuse.
Sadie instantly thought back to the tense and uncomfortable lunch at Noah’s villa just a few hours ago. She could still see the hostility in Hailey’s eyes.
“Sorry,” Sadie said. “But I already have plans tonight.”noveldrama
Noah pursed his lips and nodded once, as though he had anticipated her refusal.
He leaned in closer, his voice slightly deeper as he said, “You must be very busy, indeed. I shall take my leave, then. As for the site selection and the construction of the factory…” He paused, the implication hanging heavy in the air between them. “Well, Burgess Group has other options apart from Wall Group.”
It was a blatant threat. This man was using their partnership as leverage to pressure her into dinner.
Sadie’s hand balled into a tight fist.
At the end of the day, their collaboration with Burgess Group was crucial, especially after the fiasco with Briley. Wall Group needed to regain its footing, to hold a strong grip on the business world. She knew she couldn’t afford to lose their most powerful ally.

Sadie plastered another smile on her face, this time a professional one.
“If you put it that way, then how can I refuse? It would be an honor and a delight to have dinner with you. Have you thought of a place?”
The corner of Noah’s eye twitched at her swift change in attitude, and he felt a pang in his chest.
Was she only willing to compromise when it benefited her?
He inhaled slowly and straightened up, putting more distance between them.
.
.
.
###Chapter 799:
“Nirvana.”
Sadie’s smile froze.
Nirvana again? Was it deliberate or simply an innocent coincidence?
Either way, she couldn’t really refuse.
Sadie loosened her fist and nodded. “Great,” she muttered.
A small, content grin tugged at Noah’s lips.
“I’ll come get you tonight,” he said, and with that, he exited the conference room.
Left standing, Sadie blinked, momentarily confused.
Nirvana again?
What was he implying?
Back at her desk in her office, she found it hard to focus.noveldrama
Her mind spun in circles, caught between the paperwork Samuel had dropped off and the lingering image of Noah.
As the evening crept in, a soft knock broke her thoughts.
Sadie looked up to see Samuel entering with an odd expression. “Ms. Hudson, Mr. Noel’s downstairs. He’s been waiting for a while.”
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat.
He actually came—early, even. There was no getting out of this dinner.
She breathed out and gently set the documents aside.
“All right, I’ll be right there.”
She straightened her outfit and walked out.
The elevator descended, and as the doors opened on the ground floor, she immediately spotted a tall figure beside the reception.
Noah turned at the ding of the elevator. His eyes lit up ever so slightly when he saw her, and he walked over.
Before she could respond, he reached for her hand.
Latest chapters ?αlnσνes?com
Her body tensed, an instinctive urge to pull away rising in her chest. The gesture felt too personal.
But his grasp was firm and didn’t allow retreat. Without a word, he gently guided her toward the entrance.
She could sense the stares from nearby staff and the receptionist. Her cheeks flared with heat, and she tilted her head downward, trying to shrink from the attention.
Weren’t they just professional acquaintances now? Was this how he interacted with all his business partners?
Noah noticed the hesitation in her steps. When she eventually stopped resisting, her hand relaxing in his, he felt the softness and oddly familiar sensation of it.
.
.
.
###Chapter 800:noveldrama
He glanced at her again, catching the rosy hue creeping up her ears—like a startled rabbit. His smile widened just a fraction.
Noah’s car was parked at the roadside.
The driver held the door, and Noah instinctively protected Sadie’s head as she stepped in.
They drove in silence. Not long after, they reached their destination—Nirvana.
The building, styled with timeless architecture, radiated a warm, alluring charm.
A waitress appeared with a bright expression the moment she spotted Sadie.
“Ms. Hudson, welcome back!”
Her attention shifted to Noah. “Good evening, sir.”
Then, turning back to Sadie, she asked, “Your usual, the Garden Room?”
Noah’s brow arched slightly.
So, Sadie was a regular? But hadn’t she seemed indifferent to the same type of cuisine at his villa? Strange.
Sadie flushed once more and gave a small, uneasy nod. “Yes, please lead the way.”
This place held echoes of the past—moments once shared with Noah. After he’d gone, she sometimes returned alone, ordering what he used to enjoy, letting afternoons drift by.
They followed the waitress through the winding halls until they arrived at a beautifully arranged private dining space, unchanged from how she remembered.
Noah gave the room a discreet once-over, quietly impressed by the ambiance.
After pouring their drinks, the waitress handed over the menu.
Sadie didn’t reach for it. Instead, she nudged it toward Noah.
Her voice was calm, her expression composed.
“Mr. Noel, since you’re the guest tonight, please feel free to choose. It’s on me.”
€$? ￠?€?$  glov?l?o
Noah didn’t argue.
With a relaxed air, he flipped through the pages.
The choices were rich—true Jazmah fare.
Without hesitation, he recited his selection.
“K?ttbullar, pot roast, sautéed shrimp, ham and bean soup, and caramelized apples.”
His tone was even, his pace unhurried.
Sadie’s grip tightened around her glass. Her fingers turned pale. Her chest felt suddenly heavy.
Those dishes—they were the same ones she always ordered.
She kept her head lowered, masking the storm behind her eyes.
Then came a surprised voice. The waitress looked between the two of them, her tone laced with curiosity. “Sir, those are Ms. Hudson’s regular picks! Are you her husband?”

Message from Noah: Have a great weekend dear readers. God loves you and Noah whishes you all the best. (?  ? – ? ) ?

###Chapter 801:
Noah blinked, caught off guard.
He looked up, curiosity flickering in his gaze.
Sadie raised her glass to her lips, feigning ease.
With a poised expression, she glanced at the waitress.
The waitress sensed the change in the atmosphere and bowed apologetically before exiting.
Setting the glass down, Sadie offered a diplomatic smile.
“Don’t read too much into it, Mr. Noel. These are local favorites. I’m just one of many who enjoy them.”
She spoke casually, brushing the situation off as pure coincidence.
Only she knew how fast her heart had been racing.
Noah observed her calm exterior, a faint crease forming on his brow. Was it really just a coincidence? There was something strangely familiar about her that tugged at his memory.
He remembered the first time they met—how she’d called him by his name. Back then, it felt odd. But now, that lingering sense of déjà vu had only grown stronger.
He leaned forward, his eyes fixed on her. “Ms. Hudson, have we met before?” The question hit like a jolt.
Sadie looked up, startled, her heart thundering in her chest. Had everything come back to him?
Then Sadie met Noah’s eyes—distant and unfamiliar as ever—and the glimmer of hope that had flared up in her chest fizzled out.
He still didn’t remember.
A wave of disappointment washed over Sadie, settling like a dead weight in the pit of her stomach. Her hand balled into a fist under the table, the only indication of her inner turmoil.
What had happened to Noah in the last three years? How had Hailey become his wife?
Sadie knew she couldn’t act recklessly before she had the answers to these burning questions. She couldn’t tell him the truth just yet, especially with the glaring fact that the world knew he and Hailey were married.
Ltτ ?hρτ?rs ιn glov?l.оm
Would Noah even believe her if she tried to tell him the truth? Or would he simply think she was playing some tricks again?
Sadie lowered her gaze and let out a heavy sigh. “You’re reading into something that isn’t there, Mr. Noel. Perhaps it’s because you look so much like my late husband.”
She had more to say, but it was left unsaid as the door to the private room opened once again. The waitress waltzed in, tray in hand, and began to serve the dishes.
“Your food is here. Please enjoy.”
There was K?ttbullar, pot roast, sautéed shrimp, ham and bean soup, and caramelized apples.noveldrama

###Chapter 802:
As the familiar dishes were placed on the table one by one, the room filled with a delightful aroma.noveldrama
Sadie sighed to herself in relief. The dangerous line of their conversation had been successfully averted.
She smiled and picked up a piece of ham, placing it on Noah’s plate. She didn’t notice the flicker of disappointment in his eyes.
“You should try this, Mr. Noel. It’s the house specialty.” Sadie tried to keep her tone as light and calm as possible. Afraid that Noah would resume what the waitress had interrupted, she quickly shifted their discussion back to work. “By the way, have you gone over the documents Samuel sent over this afternoon? About the…”
“Piece of land in the east of the city? As I mentioned, it’s an ideal location—situated between the city and the suburbs. It’s easily accessible, and the land area is impressive. I think it’s worth considering.”
When she spoke, her tone had shifted, becoming brisk and businesslike.
Noah silently picked up his fork and took a bite of the ham. The flavor was excellent.
He took another bite but paused mid-chew.
It tasted somewhat familiar, though he couldn’t quite place why. He set his fork down, choosing not to dwell on it. When he looked up, his expression had returned to its usual indifference.
“The land will be taken into consideration. In fact, I’m leaving the bidding entirely in your hands, Ms. Hudson.”
Sadie, who had already prepared an outline of the advantages of purchasing the land, was just about to continue when his words sank in. She blinked, visibly taken aback.
He would leave it entirely to her?
Everything—from the bidding to the construction of the factory—was crucial for the Burgess Group’s operations, and yet, he was entrusting it all to her?
That didn’t sit right.
A cloud of doubt crossed Sadie’s face. “Don’t you think it’s a bit inappropriate? After all, it’s the Burgess Group’s—”
Fresh chapters just uploaded g?lnσν?s?c?m
“What’s the problem, Ms. Hudson?” Noah suddenly interrupted. “Do you not want it?”
Just like that, the air between them turned oppressive once again.
Once more, Noah was using their partnership as leverage to pressure her into compliance. Sadie’s hand clenched. She couldn’t afford to lose the Burgess Group’s support.
Gritting her teeth, she forced a professional smile and acted as if she had never been reluctant. “Of course I want it. It’s such an honor to have your trust, Mr. Noel. Please rest assured—I will handle everything properly.”
Noah’s eyes were unreadable as he observed her reaction.
.
.
.
###Chapter 803:
Without warning, he stood up and buttoned his suit jacket.
“Since that’s settled, please enjoy your meal, Ms. Hudson. I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave now.”
He turned and strode toward the door without a glance back, leaving Sadie alone with a table full of untouched food.
She was utterly bewildered.
Why had Noah left just like that? What was he trying to achieve?
Meanwhile, Noah practically staggered into his car.
The taste of that small piece of ham still lingered in his mouth.noveldrama
The flavor was too familiar—so familiar that it made him uneasy.
He slumped into the back seat and closed his eyes. He couldn’t shake the image of Sadie’s forced composure from his mind.
She always had that complex, yet meaningful look on her face whenever their eyes met.
It wasn’t the kind of look one would give a mere business partner, nor the kind a widow would give to someone who resembled her deceased husband.
The car sped toward his villa in the suburbs.
Noah still felt unsettled as he stepped into the living room, and it was clear in the way he carried himself. He looked exhausted. The butler greeted him with a concerned expression.
“You’re home, Mr. Noel. I’m afraid Ms. Burgess still refuses to eat. She’s locked herself in her room and won’t open the door for anyone. Maybe you could try talking to her?”
Noah exhaled slowly, running his hand over his face.
Hailey was doing it again.
Every time his attitude toward Sadie shifted, Hailey would act out.
“What happened this time?”
g?lnσν?s?com delivers what you seek
Nicholas exhaled deeply and spoke in a hushed tone. “Ever since you stepped out this afternoon, Ms. Burgess has been in low spirits. She’s remained locked in her room and skipped dinner. I knocked repeatedly, but there was no answer. I’m genuinely worried something might be wrong.”
Noah’s brows twitched with irritation, but he gave a curt nod.
Hailey had once saved his life—he couldn’t ignore her now.
“I’ll go see how she’s doing.”
He ascended the stairs and paused before Hailey’s door, knocking softly. He parted his lips to speak, but for some reason, Sadie’s defiant gaze flickered in his mind.
That odd stirring in his chest returned, but he brushed it away.
“Hailey,” he finally said.
.
.
.
###Chapter 804:
Inside the room, Hailey lay curled beneath her blanket, motionless.
The distant sound of Noah’s voice struck her like a stone.
She picked up on the faint irritation in his tone, and dread began to rise.
She clenched her teeth, her voice strained and muffled beneath the blanket. “I’m okay. Noah, if divorcing me and marrying her is truly what you want, I won’t fight it. I’ll just accept that I saved the wrong person.”
Her words brimmed with hurt, every sentence a stab of guilt meant to remind Noah how much she had sacrificed.
Outside, Noah’s expression tightened.
He took a slow breath and answered, his tone composed. “The alliance between Burgess Group and Wall Group is strictly professional. Don’t let it trouble you.”
His words were meant to ease the tension, but to Hailey, they cut deeper.
Strictly professional?
That was all Sadie and the Wall Group meant to him now?
Anger surged inside her.
She sat upright and kicked off the blanket but didn’t say a word, letting only a few quiet sobs escape.
She hoped he’d come in, like he always did. That he’d embrace her and try to soothe her pain.
But after a pause… nothing. The door remained shut.
And soon, his footsteps began to retreat.
He was leaving?
She stared at the door, stunned.
That wasn’t like him.
Even in her worst moods, he always stayed.
g?lnσν?s?c?m fuels your imagination
But now… he walked away?
Her pulse quickened with confusion and fury. Tears welled in her eyes as she ran to the door and flung it open.
Noah was still there—his back turned, broad shoulders set, demeanor cold. He glanced over his shoulder when he heard her, his expression hidden behind the mask, but the apathy in his gaze was unmistakable.
Hailey’s throat tightened. She blinked hard, her voice trembling as emotion overwhelmed her.
She sniffed, her voice choked with sobs as she questioned him. “Noah! Have you really forgotten who Sadie is? Have you forgotten how she seized control of Wall Group? How she impersonated your wife? She’s nothing but an unscrupulous bitch!”noveldrama
Noah’s frown deepened.
“Don’t talk nonsense, Hailey,” he replied, his voice edged with disapproval. “I can decide for myself who’s sincere and who’s playing games. Right now, what you need is rest. Nicholas has prepared something light for you. Eat it.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 805:
Without waiting for a reply, he turned and strode away.
Hailey remained rooted to the spot, her thoughts spinning.
He told her to stop talking nonsense?
She felt a chill run down her spine, as if she had fallen into an icy pit.
Her Noah had changed.
The man before her was no longer the one who used to bend over backward for her.
He was slipping away.
And worse… he was defending Sadie.
Fear settled in Hailey’s gut.noveldrama
If Noah’s memories came back—if everything from his past resurfaced—what would she do then?
Everything she had worked so hard to build would crumble like ash in the wind.
No, she wouldn’t allow that.
She needed a way to keep his affection locked in place and stop those memories from resurfacing.
Turning on her heel, she re-entered the room and locked the door. From the dresser, she retrieved her phone and punched in a number.
It rang only once.
“Hailey?”
Her tone was light and sugary as ever. “Hi, Evan.”
Meanwhile, Sadie stepped back into Myrtlewood Estate.
A tiny form scampered over, arms flung around her leg with glee.
Averi peered up at her with gleaming eyes.
“Mom, you said Mr. Noel would come play with me!”
g?a?l?n?o?v?e?l?s?.?c?o?m? = 
Sadie stopped short, her expression softening.
How could she tell her little boy that the man he adored was actually his father—just not the one he remembered?
She crouched down, gently running her fingers through his soft curls.
“Averi, why are you still awake?”
She glanced over at the wall clock. It was nearly ten.
“You know, Mr. Noel likes kids who go to sleep on time. If you’re in bed early, he might visit soon.”
Averi’s smile faded slightly, his lips forming a small pout.
He really missed Patrick.
Though Patrick had been quiet, Averi had felt a deep bond with him.
.

###Chapter 806:
Sadie watched her son’s disappointed expression, her heart aching.
She gathered him into her arms, her voice low and comforting.
“How about a bedtime story tonight, then we’ll both turn in early?”
Averi hesitated, still a little downcast.
He missed Patrick dearly, but his love for his mother came first.noveldrama
He sniffled, then nestled his head into Sadie’s neck and gave a tiny nod.
“All right.”
Once he was asleep, Sadie slipped quietly out of the room.
Night had already cloaked the world outside.
She went directly to the study.
Pressing her temples, she picked up her phone and dialed a familiar number.
The connection was swift.
“Ms. Hudson,” came the reply.
“Samuel, I need you to begin prepping for the bidding of the land in the east.” Her tone was tired but firm.
“Noted, Ms. Hudson,” Samuel responded. “Actually, there’s something else I was about to tell you.”
“Oh? Go ahead.”
“It’s about the physicians in Zupren,” Samuel said, his voice turning grave. “The private investigator I hired uncovered something. In addition to Hailey, there was another top-tier neurologist at Rosewood Hospital back then—Evan Gill. Apparently, he’s in the country on business.”
Sadie’s hand clenched the phone a little tighter.
“The detective traced his schedule. He’s flying back to Zupren tomorrow evening. Before that, he’s having dinner at Dinner Bell with a friend.”
Sadie’s brows drew together.
g?ν. – ? 
It felt invasive to disrupt someone’s private meal—but she couldn’t afford to pass up this chance.
Who knew when she’d get another lead on Evan?
She paused, weighing her options, then gave a resolute nod to herself.
“Got it. Make the necessary arrangements, Samuel. I’ll meet him at Dinner Bell tomorrow.”
“Understood, Ms. Hudson.”
Sadie ended the call, and the room fell silent again.
Leaning back in her chair, she shut her eyes. Her thoughts swirled restlessly.
Without thinking, her hand moved to her abdomen, cradling it lightly.
.

###Chapter 807:
A discomfort settled in her stomach again—waves of queasiness and little to no appetite had become common.
She didn’t know the cause.
Maybe it was simply fatigue. Or stress. Or both.
A soft sigh escaped her lips as she sat there, completely drained.
The next evening, Sadie entered the Dinner Bell.
The place had a general elegance to it, with soft piano music playing in the background.
She sat by the window, holding a tablet that displayed a data chart on Wall Group’s recent operations.
Her mind, however, was elsewhere.
Every so often, her gaze would flit over to the restaurant’s entrance, and her fingers would tap against the surface of her tablet in anticipation.
After what felt like forever, she finally saw a tall man in a dark suit step into the establishment. He had a refined demeanor that was quite hard to miss.
The man was none other than Evan Gill, the doctor Samuel had mentioned.
Evan scanned the floor, clearly searching for someone, his expression urgent. When he didn’t find who he was looking for, he headed straight to a private room located further back in the restaurant.
Sadie quickly averted her gaze.
Once Evan had disappeared through the door, she rose from her seat, adjusted her clothes, and discreetly walked toward the same private room.
Instead of knocking on the door, she took a seat just a couple of tables away. From there, she could hear the conversation from the people inside the private room.
It seemed that the room hadn’t been soundproofed properly—thank God.
Sadie held her breath and focused all her attention on eavesdropping.
Indeed, she was able to make out the voices on the other side.

Apart from Evan, Sadie also heard a woman—her voice sweet and coquettish.
She froze.
She recognized that voice. It belonged to Hailey!
What was she doing here? Was Hailey the one Evan came to meet? What kind of business would the two discuss inside?
Sadie’s hands balled into fists, and a muscle ticked at her jaw.
She took a deep breath to maintain her composure, exhaled slowly, and continued listening to the conversation inside.
At that same moment, inside the private room, Hailey was wearing a sickeningly sweet smile.
“It’s been years since we last met, and you’re even more charming than I remembered, Evan!”

###Chapter 808:
Evan’s smile was a little tight.
“Is there something you need, Hailey? Why did you reach out to me all of a sudden?”
His tone was courteous but made it clear they were far from being close.
Hailey’s eyes practically twinkled as her smile widened.
“Have a seat first, why don’t you? Let’s catch up and chat over a meal.”
Evan nodded graciously and sat down.
As he settled into his seat, he remembered something.
“By the way, I heard you got married recently. I have yet to meet your husband, but I’ve heard that he’s quite a catch. People say you two are perfect for each other.”
His comment seemed to touch a nerve with Hailey. Her smile dimmed, and she let out a weary, almost sorrowful sigh.noveldrama
“He’s very good to me, but…”
Hailey trailed off and batted her eyelashes as though she were deeply aggrieved.
“The thing is, Patrick only fell in love with me because he lost his memory in an accident three years ago. I’m just… I’m really scared that one day he’ll regain his memory and leave me.”
By the time she finished speaking, the corners of her eyes had turned red, making her look as pitiful as ever.
Evan’s brow furrowed slightly. Just like he had said, he had never met Patrick before, but he had heard a lot about him, and from what he had surmised, the man didn’t seem like the type to discard his relationships so easily.
“You shouldn’t worry about such things, Hailey. I don’t think he would do that to you.”
Hailey wiped nonexistent tears from her cheeks.
“I trust him, of course, but there’s this wretched woman who’s constantly meddling with our marriage! She just keeps inserting herself into his business, pulling every trick in the book to get his attention! I can’t help but worry!”
Then she suddenly leaned over the table, her eyes wide with expectation as she fixed them on Evan.

“Aren’t you doing research on deep hypnosis these days? I heard that it can make someone forget their past completely and live like a totally new person. Is that true?”
She had barely gotten the last word out when Evan raised his hand.
“Hailey!” he said, his tone sharp and reprimanding, his expression dark.
“The purpose of my research—”
“…is to help in the recovery of those who are in a vegetative state. My goal is to help them rebuild their cognitive functions, not to serve one person’s selfish desires to alter or erase another’s memories!”
Evan’s disappointment was written all over his face.
.

.
###Chapter 809:
“You weren’t like this before.”
The Hailey he used to know was kind and passionate about medicine, a far cry from the woman in front of him.
Hailey flinched, clearly panicked by his reaction.
“You’re misunderstanding. I just love Patrick so much, and I told you, I am terrified of losing him!”
In a move that shocked Evan, Hailey lunged forward and reached for the collar of his shirt.
“Evan, I’m already pregnant!”
“If… if Patrick regains his memory and abandons me, then my baby will lose its father! What should I do then?”
Hailey choked on her words like a helpless and fragile girl.
“I’m begging you, Evan! For the sake of the baby I’m carrying, help me, your friend, out just this once! Just this once, please!”
Outside, Sadie heard every word clearly.
Her fists were clenched so tightly, her nails were almost drawing blood from her palms.
Hailey was pregnant?
The revelation struck Sadie like a bolt of lightning, shaking her to her very core. She couldn’t listen to another word. Her stomach roiled, and a wave of nausea threatened to bubble up her throat.
Scrambling to her feet, she hurried out of the restaurant in a daze and jumped into the car parked by the road.
Samuel glanced at her from the driver’s seat. Seeing her exit the restaurant so quickly had initially made him assume that the meeting had gone well. But upon closer inspection, he realized that Sadie was deathly pale. He swallowed the words he was about to say.
As for Sadie, her thoughts were still a mess.
Hailey was pregnant… She was actually pregnant…

Was the baby Noah’s?
Yes, of course it was! Who else could it be? They were husband and wife, after all. Everyone knew it!
Sadie scoffed at herself. Who did she think she was?
In the end, she could only muster a bitter smile at her predicament. Even if Noah regained his memory, what difference would it make?noveldrama
Hailey was already pregnant.
As things stood, there really was no point in revealing the truth anymore.
Sadie took a deep breath and calmed herself.
.

.
###Chapter 810:
When she lifted her head again, her eyes were clear and devoid of any emotion.
“Let’s head home.”
Samuel simply nodded and started the car.
Even as they pulled up in front of Myrtlewood Estate, Sadie was deep in her thoughts. She only came back to her senses when Samuel spoke.
“We’ve arrived, Ms. Hudson.”
Sadie nodded and pushed the car door open to get out.
Just as her feet touched the gravel path, a familiar voice—deep and gentle—called out to her.
“Sadie.”
She froze in her tracks. Her body was rigid as she slowly turned around.
Sure enough, Noah stood there, seemingly waiting for her.
He wasn’t wearing that cold silver mask today, and his handsome features appeared somewhat soft.
Sadie’s hands balled into fists again as the things she had overheard at Dinner Bell came crashing back in full force.
She said nothing and quickly looked away, intending to flee into the safety of her villa.
She was trying to avoid him, and Noah knew it.
He took two long strides and grabbed her arm.
“What’s wrong?”
Her skin was cold to the touch, sending a chill down his spine.
Sadie forcefully pulled her arm free and took several steps back for good measure.
“Aren’t you supposed to be with your wife and baby, Mr. Noel?” she asked sarcastically. “What are you doing here, seeking me out at this hour? Do you have a new business project to discuss? If not, then please leave. If you do, then you’ll have to wait until the morning, and we can talk about it during my working hours.”
She still refused to look at Noah.

By then, Averi had heard the commotion from the living room, and he came bounding out the door and down the steps toward them.
The boy’s eyes immediately lit up when they fell on the man who resembled his father so much.
Averi didn’t even hesitate to rush over and hug Noah’s leg.
“Dad, you’re back! That’s great! Mom and I have missed you so much.”
A small gasp escaped Sadie’s lips. She hadn’t seen this coming at all. Worse yet, Averi’s words broke her heart.noveldrama
Noah had lost his memory and had already started a new family, but Averi was still his son, after all. She couldn’t be selfish and keep the two away from each other.
.
.
.
###Chapter 811:
“Since you’re already here, you might as well spend some time with Averi,” Sadie said in a tight voice before disappearing into the villa.
Averi stared in the direction of the front door, puzzled by his mother’s strange behavior.
Noah, on the other hand, was still reeling from the unexpected encounter. He rather liked being called “Dad.”
It was only natural, of course, since he truly was Averi’s father.
But as far as the current Noah knew, Sadie had pretended to be his wife in his absence in order to seize the position of chairwoman in Wall Group.
So how did this little boy come about?
Noah peered at Averi for a moment before picking him up, his lips already curled into a smile.
Averi swung his legs and asked Noah in a cutesy voice to do puzzles with him and tell him a story.
Noah hesitated for a few seconds, only to find himself agreeing without really giving it much thought.
He carried Averi into the villa, but just as he stepped into the foyer, he was assaulted by a wave of dizziness—the worst one yet.noveldrama
He blinked at his surroundings. Everything felt oddly familiar for some reason…
“Dad, what’s wrong?”
Averi tilted his head, his little face scrunched up in worry as he tugged at Noah’s collar.
Noah snapped back to the present and mustered a smile to comfort the little boy.
But Averi only blinked at him, his eyes still wide with confusion.
He pursed his lips, feeling a little frustrated that he couldn’t understand what these adults around him were thinking.
Then he remembered something, and he began to squirm in Noah’s arms until he was put down.
?  ? : ν
Averi ran to a nearby table and grabbed a framed photo.
It was a picture from three years ago—a photo of Sadie and Noah together. Although neither was smiling in the picture, Noah’s gaze was fixed intently on Sadie’s face. They looked like the perfect match.
Noah’s eyes grew intense as he stared at the photo in silence.
All of a sudden, the frame was snatched from his hands.
Sadie had approached without him noticing, and she unceremoniously tossed the photo into the trash bin.
“Some things are best left in the past,” she said as she turned away to leave.
.
.
.
###Chapter 812:
Noah stared after her in stunned silence until she disappeared around the corner.
He turned to Averi and crouched down.
“Be a good boy and do your puzzles on your own for a bit, okay? Daddy and Mommy have something to talk about. I’ll join you soon.”
Averi pouted again, obviously reluctant to say yes, but he ultimately nodded his agreement.
Noah shot up to his feet and hurried after Sadie.
He needed to find out what was going on, once and for all. The sense of familiarity and the deep unease that constantly haunted him… And then there was that child. Everything just felt off.
Sadie heard the study door open behind her, just a couple of seconds after she had closed it.
She whipped around to find Noah standing there, and she didn’t bother masking her impatience.
What was he up to now? All she wanted was peace, and to be away from him.
But Noah didn’t give her a chance to send him away. He stepped forward and grabbed her by the wrist.
“What exactly happened three years ago?” he asked, his voice deep and urgent.
Sadie struggled against the force of his grip. She hissed through gritted teeth, eyes flashing.
“Let go!”
She tried to shake off his hand with all her might, but she was no match for his strength.
In the end, Sadie threw back her head and let out a bitter laugh.
“What even is the point of asking me this now?” she asked, her voice dripping with disdain. “You already have a new wife, with a baby on the way. Hailey is pregnant, isn’t she? Why even bother with me still?”noveldrama
When Noah heard this, his grip tightened, and his brows drew into a frown.
Check full story at gον. 
Hailey was pregnant? What the hell was going on?
No, that was completely impossible.
Sadie caught the shock that crossed his face.
It only made her despise him more; he was still putting on an act after everything?
“Mr. Noel—or should I say, Noah Wall.” She practically spat out his name, a name she hadn’t said in a long time. “Your wife is pregnant, and here you are, acting like you don’t know. What kind of husband does that make you? Or perhaps you’re just a really good actor.”
Either way, she had no interest in getting tangled up with him anymore.
A muscle ticked in Noah’s jaw. It was clear that Sadie didn’t trust him. She wouldn’t believe a word he said, even if it was the truth.
.
.
.
###Chapter 813:
As much as his heart ached at that realization, he chose not to explain himself any further.
Instead, he pulled her into a tight embrace, pressing her flush against his chest.
Sadie froze, completely caught off guard by his actions.
Then that familiar lavender scent rose to meet her, and eventually enveloped her.noveldrama
This time, however, without that silver mask covering his face, Noah’s presence was much clearer—and all the more unsettling.
How did things end up this way?
Noah rested his chin on top of Sadie’s head and gently nuzzled her hair. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath in a desperate attempt to calm the raging emotions in his heart.
“Sadie, just give me a little more time.”
He felt her stiffen at his words. He tightened his arms around her.
“I will get to the bottom of all of this.”
Noah paused for a moment, and when he spoke again, his voice was deeper.
“Hailey’s pregnancy has nothing to do with me.”
Sadie inhaled sharply. She raised her head to look at him. She tried to push him away, but he held her even tighter.
What did he mean—it had nothing to do with him? Was the baby not his?
Noah felt Sadie relax slightly, so he loosened his grip a little, but made sure she stayed firmly in his embrace.
“Sadie,” he said, his tone serious and weary. “All I ask is a little more time. Will you give me that, at least?”
He reached up and stroked her hair, his gaze tender.
“Ever since I returned from Nirvana yesterday, everything just didn’t feel right.”
He paused again, trying to find the right words to say.
?@?é$? t?εя? íπ ?alπoνεl?.c
“A lot of things don’t make sense. That’s why I came here, to talk to you.”
He desperately needed answers, and his instincts told him that the answers lay with this woman in front of him.
Sadie sighed and leaned her head against his broad chest.
She had to admit, his plea stirred what she thought was her already lifeless heart.
Had she been wrong in her assumptions?
Gradually, the chaos in her mind began to settle, and the dull pain in her heart seemed to lessen.
After collecting herself, Sadie gently pushed Noah away.
She turned her back to him, her voice betraying none of her emotions when she said,

###Chapter 814:
“It’s late. Averi has school tomorrow. You… you should leave.”
Noah sighed softly to himself. He was being dismissed.
“I’ll go, then. Have a good night.”
With that, he turned and left the study.
Meanwhile, Hailey returned to the suburban villa feeling utterly defeated.
Her meeting with Evan had not only been unfruitful, but it had also been extremely frustrating.
She walked into a brightly lit living room, but she didn’t see Noah anywhere.
Her chest tightened as she looked around for any sign of him.
Was Noah not home?
He should be back by this time.
A sense of foreboding crept over Hailey.
Right on cue, Nicolas, the butler, emerged from the servants’ quarters and approached her.noveldrama
“Ms. Burgess,” he said, his tone and face cautious. “You’re back.”
Hailey looked him up and down with narrowed eyes.
“Where’s Patrick?”
Something flickered in Nicolas’s face, and he lowered his head.
“Mr. Noel…”
His voice faltered, as though he was afraid to say the rest of the words.
This immediately triggered Hailey’s temper. She hated when people acted like this in front of her.
“Speak!”
Nicolas jumped and shuddered.
Hailey was usually sweet and charming to others, but once she snapped, she was quite frightening.
 ? : ga l no v els .co m
Nicolas thought better than to hide anything and told Hailey all he knew.
“Mr. Noel left about two hours ago. I noticed that he didn’t look well, so I had the driver follow him. The driver just reported back that he went to Myrtlewood Estate.”
Myrtlewood Estate!
So, Noah had gone to see that wretched woman again!
Hailey’s hands clenched into fists. She was about to burst with rage.
Her lips curled into a bitter smile when she recalled how she had painted herself as a victim to Evan a while ago. She had told him that she was afraid Noah would abandon her if he regained his memory.
.
.
.
###Chapter 815:
And now this?
Noah didn’t even have to regain his lost memory before he went out seeking that bitch.
And Evan, that bastard! Why couldn’t he just help her?
He had helped her a lot back at Rosewood Hospital, so why was he so adamant about refusing her this time?
To think that she had humbled herself and begged, yet he refused her without a second thought. He even went on to lecture her.
That self-righteous prick!
Evan claimed that the goal of his research was to help the sick, and not to be used for selfish gains.
Well, how very noble of him! If he didn’t want to help her, he should have just said so without rambling on and on about his supposed virtues!
Hailey had lost her mind, throwing everything she could reach onto the floor.
Her chest heaved, her face a mask of frustration and resentment.
Why did Sadie so easily capture Noah’s attention?
And when Hailey begged Evan, all she received was humiliation!
Nicolas stood by the door, too nervous to even breathe.
He kept his head down, avoiding her furious gaze.
Just then, someone pushed the villa’s front door open.
It was Noah!
Nicolas’s face brightened as if he’d seen his savior, relief washing over him.
He rushed forward, his voice shaking.
“Mr. Noel, you’re back! Ms. Burgess—”
Noah scanned the chaos in the living room, his eyebrows knitting together.

His face darkened.
“What are you doing?”
Hailey was about to smash a delicate porcelain vase, but his voice stopped her.
She slowly placed the vase back on the side cabinet.
She turned and saw Noah in the doorway.
His face was blank, his gaze icy, sending a wave of panic through her.
In the next moment, Hailey’s eyes filled with tears, a swell of grievance overtaking her.
“Noah, you never talked to me so harshly before.” Her voice broke slightly.
“Have you really fallen for Sadie?”
Noah’s irritation grew sharper at her words.
His frown deepened.noveldrama
.
.
.
###Chapter 816:
He wasn’t here to argue.
“Come to the study.”
Without another look, he headed upstairs.
Hailey remained still, unease flooding her.
What did he want to discuss in the study?
Was it a warning not to provoke Sadie again?
Or perhaps—noveldrama
She didn’t let herself think further.
After a long moment, she gathered her strength, bit her lip, and followed him upstairs.
Inside the study, Hailey stood tense in front of the desk.
She looked up, meeting Noah’s intense gaze.
She parted her lips to speak first but found herself speechless.
Noah was quick to break the silence.
His tone was blunt, his gaze unwavering.
“You’re pregnant?”
His statement landed like a thunderbolt, startling Hailey.
Her eyes widened, and her face lost all color.
How had he found out?
She had only recently confirmed it herself and had been planning to stage an intimate scene before surprising him with the news.
But he was already aware.
It took her by surprise.
Her heart pounded, her thoughts racing.
? ? : g?ν
Noah’s frosty stare remained locked on her.
Suddenly, he rose, his presence dominating as he approached her step by step.
“Hailey, we’ve been married for three years but have never had sex. Whose child is this?”
Hailey broke down.
“Yes, I’m pregnant!” Her voice cracked as she yelled, tears streaming down her face. “But what does it matter?”
She met Noah’s gaze defiantly.
“Noah, our marriage has been a sham from the start. We haven’t shared a life, let alone a bed. Do you know what people say about me? My father—he’s been pushing us every day to have a child so he can know the joy of being a grandfather! What am I supposed to tell him? Should I tell him that the son-in-law he admires won’t even touch me?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 817:
Her tears were unrelenting.
Overwhelmed, she could barely keep herself upright.
In a desperate gesture, she reached out and grasped Noah’s arm.
At this point, denying or making excuses seemed pointless.
All she could do was make one final, desperate attempt.
“Noah, you are the only one I’ve ever loved!”
Hailey sobbed, her voice quaking with desperation.
“I’m pregnant, but… for our marriage, for the fact I saved your life… Please, let me have this baby. Just think of it as yours, okay?”
She was pleading for Noah to accept another man’s child as his own.
Noah listened, finding the idea absurd.noveldrama
His chest heaved a few times, but ultimately, he just let out a cold, mocking laugh.
He jerked his hand away from hers.
The force was so strong that Hailey staggered back.
Turning away, he said, his voice frosty,
“Get out.”
Hailey stood rooted to the spot.
She hadn’t anticipated that, even after her desperate plea, he would remain unmoved.
Refusing to give up, she tried again.
“Noah, please think this over!”
But Noah’s patience had worn thin.
He spoke again, his voice commanding and unmistakable.
“I said get out. Now.”
G3t th3 r34l st0r￥ @ g4ln0v3ls.c0m
Realizing further appeals were useless, Hailey walked into the hallway, her heart full of bitterness.
She couldn’t accept defeat so easily!
Noah had clearly fallen for that detestable woman, Sadie!
Instinctively, she touched her flat stomach.
Would Noah ever accept this child? Given his reaction, it seemed unlikely.
She couldn’t rely solely on him.
Her eyes flicked around as she plotted her next move.
She had no other option.
It was time to take another risk.
This time, she had to succeed.
In the study, Noah sighed wearily and slumped into his chair, massaging his temples.
.
.
.
###Chapter 818:
Hailey had saved his life, a fact that had been drilled into him since he woke up. But recalling Sadie’s defiant look and Averi’s gentle voice calling him “Dad,” he couldn’t bring himself to fulfill Hailey’s ridiculous demand.
Acknowledging another man’s child would dishonor both Hailey and himself.
It was utterly inconceivable.
He tugged at his tie in frustration.
Just then, his phone rang. It was Jack, his assistant.
He answered, his voice tinged with exhaustion.
“Speak.”
“Mr. Noel.”
Jack’s voice was as respectful as ever through the receiver.
“You asked me to investigate Ms. Hudson’s past. I’ve found something.”
Noah’s expression hardened, and he sat up straight. His grip on the phone tightened.
“Go on.”
Jack paused, seemingly organizing his thoughts.
“I spoke with an old servant from Wall Manor. She revealed that Ms. Hudson was secretly married to Mr. Noah Wall, the former CEO of Wall Group, nine years ago.”
Noah’s breath hitched.
Jack continued,
“About six years ago, rumors of their impending divorce circulated, apparently due to a woman named Kyla Wade returning to the country. Shortly after, Ms. Hudson moved to Zupren to attend Majestic Ego Design Academy. She was there for three years before she came back.”noveldrama
A sharp pain shot through Noah’s chest as he heard this.
Kyla.
The name seemed familiar, yet elusive.
L?tt chαpt?rs ιn glnov?l.m
But a wave of revulsion rose within him.
He asked, his voice low and steady,
“Where is Kyla now?”
Jack hesitated before replying bluntly,
“Kyla died three years ago, according to records. However, Kyla had a close friend named Vivi Quinn. She orchestrated the car accident that left you comatose three years ago. She’s currently in prison.”
Noah clenched his fists.
He was determined to uncover the truth.
“Jack, set up a meeting. I need to see Vivi as soon as possible.”

###Chapter 819:
“Understood, Mr. Noel.”
Before the call ended, Nicholas burst in, his face marked by panic.
He was so distressed that he lost his usual composure, his voice quivering.
“Mr. Noel! Ms. Burgess—she… she took sleeping pills to end her life!”
What?
Noah stood, shocked, his eyes wide with disbelief.noveldrama
Meanwhile, at Myrtlewood Estate, Sadie stood motionless in the cavernous living room, the silence pressing in around her like a second skin.
Her chest rose and fell in shallow breaths, as if trying to contain a storm brewing inside her.
The news of Hailey’s pregnancy echoed in her mind, sharp and cruel—like a splinter lodged deep in her ribs.
Her eyes drifted to the corner of the room, where the trash bin stood half hidden in shadow.
Moving as if in a trance, she stepped toward it, crouched down, and gently retrieved the photo she’d tossed away hours earlier.
A snapshot from three years ago. Noah was beside her, his arm wrapped loosely around her waist.
No smile, but his eyes… his eyes told a different story.
They had once looked at her like she was the only thing that mattered.
Her fingers brushed over his face in the picture, slow and cautious, as if she were afraid the memory might shatter under her touch.
A lump formed in her throat. She couldn’t tell if it was sorrow, longing, or something more complicated—something unnamed.
The silence broke with a sudden buzz.
Her phone lit up. Samuel.
?  hρt?rs ? glov?ls.0
Sadie closed her eyes and exhaled a shaky breath.
“What is it?”
“Ms. Hudson!”
Samuel’s voice crackled through the speaker, tight with urgency—far more anxious than usual.
“There’s been an incident at Mr. Noel’s villa in the suburbs.”
Sadie’s breath caught. A flicker of dread coiled in her chest.
“What kind of incident?” she asked, already fearing the answer.
“Our guy—the one keeping watch—just reported seeing Mr. Noel carrying Hailey out of the villa. It didn’t look good. He rushed her to Jazmah Hopevale Hospital.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 820:
Sadie stood still, the weight of the news slamming into her like a wave.
Hailey. The baby.
Did something happen to them?
“Was she hurt? Do we know what happened?”
Samuel replied, uncertainty in his voice,
“Not exactly. Details are sketchy. But… Mr. Noel looked panicked. Hailey seemed unconscious.”noveldrama
Sadie’s grip on the phone tightened, her knuckles whitening.
This wasn’t her problem. Hailey’s condition—her pregnancy—none of it had anything to do with her.
And yet…
The image of Noah’s stricken face flared in her mind.
If Hailey was truly in danger, the fallout could be disastrous. The Burgess family wouldn’t just stand by.
And Noah—he’d be caught right in the center of it all.
She couldn’t let that happen. Not without trying.
“Understood,” she said quietly, and ended the call.
Without another second’s hesitation, Sadie reached for the coat draped over the sofa, slinging it over her shoulders.
She was out the door before the echo of her footsteps had time to fade, sliding into her car, heart pounding.
The engine roared to life as she sped to Jazmah Hopevale Hospital.
The night lay heavy over Myrtlewood Estate, cloaking the grounds in a velvet hush.
Unseen in the shadows just beyond the gates, a pair of sharp eyes tracked Sadie’s taillights as they disappeared into the distance.
Inside a nondescript black sedan, Briley lowered her binoculars, her knuckles pale from the grip.
Lɑττ cнαρτ?rs n glov?l.o
She had come intending to sniff around Sadie’s affairs, maybe dig up something useful to earn favor.
But this—Sadie speeding off in the dead of night, face tight with worry—this was unexpected.
That wasn’t the look of someone heading to a late-night business meeting.
Where could she have gone at this hour?
No, this was something else. Urgent. Personal.
Briley narrowed her eyes in contemplation.
She wanted to see what Sadie was up to with her own eyes.

###Chapter 821:
She glanced at the driver and said,
“Follow her. But keep your distance.”
Meanwhile, at Jazmah Hopevale Hospital, inside the harsh white glow of the emergency room, Noah stood silently, his broad shoulders slumped with exhaustion.
The process of gastric lavage had been grueling.
A doctor approached, his white coat rustling faintly as he walked up. His voice was professional, but there was a clear undercurrent of reproach.
“Sir, your wife is stable now. We performed gastric lavage just in time. She and the baby… they’re both safe—for now.”
The doctor wasn’t finished. His tone grew firmer.
“That said, her emotional state is highly volatile. Elevated stress levels are putting the pregnancy at risk. Whatever happened between you two—”
He paused, searching Noah’s face, before adding,
“You need to find a way to communicate with her. Properly. For everyone’s sake. In her current condition, another emotional shock could do real harm. As her husband, you should try to understand her… be gentler. She needs emotional care now more than ever.”
Noah’s jaw tightened. A shadow flickered in his eyes.
Husband? Wife? Baby?
Each word struck like a hollow bell—too familiar, yet foreign. They rolled off someone else’s tongue with ease, but to him, they felt… wrong, like lines from a script he didn’t remember writing.
His voice was flat, a sharp contrast to the doctor’s worry.
“Noted. You can go now.”
The doctor hesitated, lips parting as if to say more, but in the end, he only exhaled quietly, gave a weary shake of his head, and walked out of the room.noveldrama
Silence settled in like a heavy fog.
  ν?
Noah turned toward the hospital bed.
Then, a flicker of movement—Hailey’s lashes trembled, and slowly, her eyes opened.
The moment her gaze landed on him, her breath hitched.
Tears gathered like storm clouds, and then spilled over in silent sobs.
She didn’t say a word—just cried, her frail frame quivering.
To anyone else, it would’ve been heartbreaking.
Hailey knew exactly what she was doing.
She knew the ache of sorrow would soften Noah’s edges.
The sight of her breaking down would twist something in him.
After what felt like an eternity, she finally looked up, eyes glassy and red-rimmed, her voice barely a whisper.
.

.
###Chapter 822:
“Why did you save me, Noah? You should have just left me to die!”
As she spoke, Hailey struggled to sit up, her arms trembling with effort—only to collapse back against the pillow, her strength failing her.
“What’s the point of staying alive?” she rasped, her voice cracking. “If… if people find out this child isn’t yours…”
Her words caught in her throat, nearly strangling her. Tears spilled freely now.
“The Burgess name… my name… everything would be destroyed. I’d become a walking scandal. Do you know what it’s like to live under that kind of scrutiny? To be whispered about, pitied, judged—every single day? Dying would be easier.”
Noah stood motionless beside the bed, his jaw clenched so tight it ached. His hands curled into fists at his sides, veins straining under taut skin.
She hadn’t mentioned how she had once saved his life. But her words dripped with implication—that everything she suffered, every broken piece of her, was for him.
And still, he swallowed the frustration clawing at his chest.
Responsibility. He could accept that. But not on her terms.
“I’ll make arrangements,” he said. “You’ll be well looked after until the child is born.”
Hailey’s crying ceased mid-sob.
Her tear-streaked face lifted slightly, hope flickering to life in her eyes like the first light of dawn.
She knew it—he still cared.
He was taking responsibility, and he wasn’t walking away.
However, before she could revel in her happiness for long, his next words hit like ice water crashing over her, numbing her to the core.
“Starting tomorrow, I won’t be living in the suburban villa anymore.”
Noah continued, his tone suddenly sharper, icier.
“And you… you will not take a single step outside that house without my permission.”noveldrama
Cont3nt hozt3d at glovels.o
Hailey sat frozen, Noah’s words echoing in her ears like a cruel sentence.
The color drained from her face. Her lips parted, but no sound came—not at first. She stared at him as if trying to wake from a bad dream.
He was leaving. He was walking away. And he was locking her away.
How was that any different from being cast aside?
He had decided to cage her and turned his back without a second thought.
“Noah…” she whispered, her voice barely audible, cracked with desperation.
She reached out instinctively, as if she could somehow pull him back.
But he didn’t turn. Not even a glance.
With mechanical calm, Noah strode toward the hospital room door, his figure unflinching, his shoulders stiff with quiet resolve.

###Chapter 823:
Without pause, he stepped out, the door closing behind him with a soft but final click.
Hailey’s chest rose and fell with shallow, shaky breaths. Her fingers curled around the edge of the blanket, knuckles pale.
And yet… even as the sting of Noah’s rejection pulsed through her, Hailey couldn’t ignore one critical truth.
Cold as he was… he had accepted the child.
That alone meant the game wasn’t over.
Suddenly, the phone on her bedside table buzzed to life, its screen glowing in the dim room.
It was her father.
Hailey stared at it for a moment, then took a steadying breath and composed herself.
She picked up.
“Hello, Dad.”
Forest’s voice crackled through the line—just a shade too eager, just familiar enough to be grating. A forced concern veiled in self-interest.
“Hailey, how are things going? Everything on schedule?”
Hailey nearly laughed. On schedule. Like she was a project. A pawn.
When had Forest ever asked how she was, beyond how useful she could be?
She buried the bitterness deep, slipped on her practiced smile, and lifted her voice with a hint of pride.
“You don’t need to worry. I’m already pregnant.”
“Really?” Forest’s tone lit up instantly, thick with satisfaction. “Excellent, Hailey. Absolutely excellent. I knew you wouldn’t fail me!”
His words were honeyed, but they stung all the same.
“Now that you’re pregnant,” Forest said, his voice humming with anticipation, “it’s time for Noah to return to Wall Group and reclaim his seat. You’ll be his wife in the public eye, Hailey—the wife of Wall Group’s chairman. And with that child, the Burgess name will finally rise to where it belongs. No one will dare look down on us again.”
He spoke like a man intoxicated by his own dreams, blind to the cracks in the foundation.

Hailey didn’t answer immediately. A slow, knowing smile tugged at her lips—cynical, hollow.
It was still too soon to talk about such things.
After all, Noah had just walked out on her minutes ago, cold as ice.
Her gaze drifted to her stomach.
“It’s too early for celebrations,” she said smoothly. “Let the pregnancy show first. That’ll make it harder for anyone to question what’s coming.”

###Chapter 824:
Then, her voice dropped a note—sharp, deliberate.
“And Sadie… she’s still in the way. As long as she’s around, I won’t have peace. He won’t be mine completely. Not yet.”
There was a long pause.
When Forest finally spoke again, his voice had shifted—lower, edged with caution.noveldrama
“I know this hasn’t been easy, Hailey. You’re right. Sadie’s presence is dangerous. If we want to secure our place… she’ll have to be eliminated.”
Hailey’s eyes darkened. The idea had crossed her mind more than once.
But every time she imagined it, another thought followed like a shadow: if Noah ever found out… he’d never forgive her. He might never even look at her the same way again.
A knowing smile touched her lips.
She leaned into the phone, her voice light and playful.
“Dad, since you’re so worried about me—and since you agree she’s a problem—why don’t you take care of her? You’ve got the connections. It’d be a walk in the park for someone like you.”
On the other end, Forest went quiet.
He knew just how dangerous Noah could be.
The hospital room door suddenly swung open.
Hailey’s breath caught in her throat. For one fleeting moment, hope surged through her—Noah came back. He couldn’t stay away. He did care.
She propped herself up on shaky elbows, eyes locked on the doorway.
But the figure that emerged was not Noah.
Her smile faltered. Her gaze turned cold.
Sadie.
  ? gν﹐
Framed in the doorway like an omen, Sadie stood still, clearly just as stunned. Her brows knitted ever so slightly as her eyes took in the sight of Hailey in the hospital bed. Her body tensed—then she turned, as if to leave.
She had no desire to linger in the same room as this woman. Not now. Not ever.
But Hailey wasn’t about to let her slip away.
Her lips curled into a slow, mocking smile—fragile, but laced with venom.
“Ms. Hudson, what a surprise. Did Patrick send you? Was he so concerned about me that he asked you to pay me a visit personally?”
A soft, mirthless laugh escaped her.
“How thoughtful of you both.”
Sadie froze. Her spine straightened, every muscle in her body stiff with restraint.
.
.
.
###Chapter 825:
Hailey paused—just long enough to reel Sadie in—then softened her tone with a feigned sweetness, every word polished to pierce.
“Ms. Hudson, I suppose you haven’t heard… I’m pregnant.”
She placed a careful hand over her abdomen and added,
“Patrick’s been absolutely devoted since he found out. He insists I focus solely on my health. Says I shouldn’t concern myself with company matters anymore. I fainted earlier at the villa, and he was beside himself. He rushed me straight here, wouldn’t even wait for an ambulance. And now, even you came all this way… I’m honestly touched. I hope I haven’t caused you too much trouble.”
Sadie’s hand clenched at her side, her nails digging into her palm. Her knuckles paled with the force of it.
Noah had told her—explicitly—that the child wasn’t his, that even he wasn’t sure where it came from.
And yet… here Hailey was, claiming Noah had been so worried as to personally rush her to the hospital.
A hollow ache twisted in Sadie’s chest, quickly calcifying into fury.
What else had he lied about?
Sadie didn’t dignify Hailey with a reply. Instead, she turned on her heel and walked out.
She didn’t see the pair of eyes watching her from the corner of the hallway.
Briley lingered in the shadows, silent and still, her gaze locked on Sadie’s retreating form.
She had seen it all—every word, every glance.
The woman lying in the hospital bed was Hailey, and from the smug exchange that had just taken place, one thing was clear: Hailey was pregnant.
A slow smile curled Briley’s lips—not one of sympathy, but of strategy.
The enemy of her enemy was her friend.
 ?  .
She understood that quite well.
Hailey, from the looks of it, was conniving, emotionally volatile, and hell-bent on getting what she wanted.noveldrama
Perfect. That kind of ambition could be molded or exploited.
With calm precision, Briley adjusted her coat, softened her features, and summoned a smile. Then, she pushed the door open and stepped inside.
Hailey, still aglow with the thrill of having shattered Sadie’s composure, turned at the sound. Her satisfaction faltered the moment she saw who had entered.
Briley?
Her posture stiffened.
Sadie had just walked out—why was this woman walking in?
.
.
.
###Chapter 826:
The smile on Hailey’s lips faded into something more formal, more guarded.
“Miss Wall,” she said cautiously. “What a surprise. What brings you here?”
Briley’s heels clicked softly against the tiled floor as she approached, her smile unwavering. But her eyes gleamed with quiet calculation.
“Oh, Hailey, darling, don’t be so formal with me.”
Briley’s voice rang out with exaggerated warmth, the kind that dripped more with performance than sincerity.
She strolled to the bedside, her tone sickly sweet and deliberately familiar.
“I heard you weren’t feeling well, so naturally, I had to stop by and check on you.”
She paused, then leaned in slightly, her voice lowering, her expression darkening.
“You know, Mr. Noel—or should I say, Noah—he’s my cousin. I’m very well acquainted with who he truly is.”
Hailey’s heart skipped a beat, but she’d learned how to mask discomfort with ease.
Briley, however, wasn’t finished.
“Between us, Hailey… I’ve never liked Sadie. She walks around as if the Wall name is hers to claim. Like she’s the savior of the family business. But she’s nothing more than the reason everything fell apart in the first place. But you—you’re carrying Noah’s child. You deserve him far more than she does. What do you say we help each other… and get rid of Sadie once and for all?”
Hailey blinked, momentarily stunned.
Briley?
Proposing an alliance?
She knew who Briley was. She was Sutton’s sister.
The memory of Sutton’s death still haunted her in quiet moments.
Hailey was silent for a long time, leading Briley to think she didn’t believe her.

Briley leaned forward and lowered her voice.
“You have to trust me, Hailey. That bitch, Sadie—she ruined my family! She caused my father to have a stroke, and now most of his body is paralyzed. Not only that, but she also caused my brother’s death! Why should she keep the position of chairwoman when her hands are so dirty?”
The more she talked, the more agitated she became, and by the time she finished her speech, her eyes were wide and blazing with rage.
It was all Briley could do not to storm right into Sadie’s house and confront her. She wanted that bitch to pay for everything she had done.
Realizing she had almost snapped, Briley calmed herself and tried to sound more sincere.
“I genuinely want to cooperate with you. I know that you want the title of Noah’s wife, and I want revenge. We can work together to bring Sadie down, and we’ll both get what we want.”
.

###Chapter 827:
Hailey blinked and took a good look at the woman in front of her, whose face was twisted in an ugly and foolish expression.
She sneered inwardly.
This was perfect.noveldrama
Since Briley had proposed the idea herself, then she couldn’t blame Hailey for going along and using her. She would use this fool to deal with Sadie, and if things went awry, Briley would be the one to take the fall.
All of Hailey’s misgivings vanished in an instant, and she plastered a sympathetic look on her face. She even managed to tear up.
“Miss Wall, I truly sympathize with your situation. Honestly, Sadie has been a problem for me for a while now. Since you’re gracious enough to extend such an offer to me, I’ll gladly take it. We’re in this together from now on.”
Meanwhile, Sadie walked toward the entrance of the hospital.
Hailey’s words kept repeating in her head like a haunting death toll.
Hailey was pregnant. Noah was worried.
So just how much of what he had told her was true?
How much should she believe?
Sadie walked in a daze, barely noticing someone up ahead.
Her face collided with a solid chest, causing her to stagger a few steps back.
Her first instinct was to apologize.
“Sorry, I—”
The rest of her words died in her throat as she looked up and met a piercing, yet concerned gaze.
It was Noah.
Sadie froze completely. Even her heart seemed to stutter.
What was he doing here?

Noah noted Sadie’s pallid color and felt his chest tighten.
He was about to ask why she was at the hospital and if she was feeling unwell, but she suddenly turned away, as if she couldn’t stand the mere sight of him.
She rushed past him toward the hospital entrance without saying another word.
Noah immediately sensed that something was wrong.
He caught up to her in two quick strides and grabbed her wrist.
Sadie struggled as soon as he touched her.
“Let go!”
Noah frowned and stepped closer.
“Sadie, what’s wrong?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 828:
Sadie felt like the entire universe was mocking her.
She scoffed and glared at him.
“You’ve already made your choice, so why are you still bothering with me? Your beloved wife is eagerly waiting for you to join her in her hospital room.”
Noah gritted his teeth, and his free hand clenched into a fist so tight, the veins on the back of his hand bulged.
He could practically see the walls Sadie had put up around her, but strangely enough, he was the one who felt suffocated.noveldrama
It finally hit him then—Sadie must have met Hailey.
“Sadie, listen to me. I will deal with Hailey and her baby. You—”
His tone was serious and earnest, but Sadie didn’t give him a chance to finish.
She forcefully shook off his hand and took several steps away from him.
“There’s no need to get me involved in any of this.”
Her voice was weak. Weary.
“I have other things to attend to. I’m leaving.”
With that, she turned on her heel and left without a single backward glance.
No matter what had happened in the past, no matter how much Noah explained, the fact remained that Hailey was pregnant.
To Sadie, that alone was enough for her to come to a decision.
Noah’s hand instinctively shot out to reach for Sadie when she turned away, but all he managed to grasp was the cold, empty air.
He remained rooted to the spot as an overwhelming and unprecedented wave of panic washed over him.
Just then, his phone vibrated.
It was Jack.
Noah exhaled slowly, burying the chaos churning beneath his calm exterior.
? ? : ?
Then he picked up the phone.
“Speak.”
“Mr. Noel. Everything’s in place. The visit to the prison is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.”
Jack’s voice came through the line, respectful and measured.
Noah’s gaze darkened, his jaw tightening ever so slightly.
“Understood.”
There was a beat of silence. Then his voice dropped, colder.
“One more thing. I want Hailey watched. Around the clock. Every move she makes—report it to me. Immediately.”
.

.
###Chapter 829:
On the other end, Jack hesitated, taken aback.
Hailey? Why?
Although he didn’t understand why Noah suddenly issued this order, he didn’t question it.
“Yes, Mr. Noel. I’ll handle it.”
The next day, at high noon, Noah entered the visitation room at Jazmah Prison.
He carried himself with quiet purpose, his presence sharp and heavy.
He sat down, his posture composed, yet every line of his face spoke of cold resolve.
Moments later, the clink of chains and the thud of boots echoed through the corridor.
A woman was led in—thin, pallid, wearing the drab uniform of the incarcerated.
Vivi.
Time had not been kind to her. Her face bore the wear of confinement, but her eyes still burned with venom and malice.
She looked up casually—then stopped dead.
Her breath hitched.
Noah?
He wasn’t dead?
Reality slammed into her like a punch to the gut.
For a beat, her mind reeled.
Why had he come? What did he want?
Still, Vivi fought to keep her expression controlled.
She slipped into that familiar fa?ade, even as her heart pounded beneath it.
Noah met her gaze with indifference.
No greeting. No small talk.
L?tτ чh?ρτ?r? ιn gɑlοv?l?.сo
“Who is Kyla?”
The question struck like lightning. Vivi’s head jerked up, eyes wide with disbelief.
Kyla? Why was he asking about her?
Her thoughts raced.
Did he not remember? Could it be…
A reckless, thrilling thought crept into her mind—he had lost his memory.
Carefully, she masked her reaction.
Her lips curled slowly into a derisive smile, laced with cruelty.noveldrama
“Mr. Wall, forgive me, but I’m a little confused…” Vivi said smoothly, tilting her head with mock innocence. “You came all this way… just to ask me about Kyla?”
She watched him intently, then leaned forward, her voice softening as she carefully accented every syllable.
.
.
.
###Chapter 830:
“Kyla was your beloved. Don’t you remember?”
The question sliced through the air like a dagger.
Noah’s brow furrowed, his jaw tightening.
No way.
The name, Kyla, gnawed at him—like a splinter under the skin.
Beloved? That couldn’t be right.
But then… could she be connected to the rift between him and Sadie six years ago?
The file Jack unearthed, the whispers of a broken marriage—could Kyla have been the reason?
Across the glass, Vivi watched him like a hawk. She saw the tension in his posture, the flicker of confusion in his eyes.
That was when she saw it—the emptiness in his eyes.
Noah had no recollection.
He didn’t know who Kyla was and seemed to detest her name.
This could change everything.
Noah inhaled slowly, pushing past the rising irritation. His voice was low, cold, steady.
“What about Sadie?”
At that name, something dark rippled across Vivi’s expression.
Her lips twitched in disgust.
“Sadie?” she repeated with a sneer. “She’s nothing more than a shameless intruder. Everything fell apart because of her. If it weren’t for—”
She stopped herself mid-sentence.
Then, her demeanor shifted. She lifted her chin, a glint of mischief and calculation flickering in her eyes.
“You want the truth, don’t you? You want to know what happened three years ago. And before that. I can tell you everything. But I want something in return.”noveldrama
She licked her dry lips, eyes gleaming with hope.
“Get me out of this hellhole first!” Vivi’s voice cracked with urgency. “Let me out, and I swear—I’ll tell you everything. Every detail, word for word. What do you say?”
Noah didn’t answer at once. He simply stared at her, a glint of cold amusement flickering in his eyes.
How pathetic.
A convicted criminal, in a prison jumpsuit, trying to negotiate with him?
Noah had faced people far more dangerous than Vivi, and not once had he bowed to threats—or bargains made in desperation.
He stood without a word, not even sparing Vivi a final glance, and turned for the door.
Panic surged through Vivi like ice water. Her pulse spiked.
.
.
.
###Chapter 831:
She couldn’t just let him walk out!
She couldn’t rot in here. Not any longer.noveldrama
Three years inside these walls had already eroded her sanity.
“Wait! Please!” she screamed, slamming her palm against the partition so hard the glass trembled.
“I’ll talk! I’ll tell you everything! Just—just make it bearable in here, please! Mr. Wall… for Kyla’s sake. For our friendship. I’m not asking for freedom—just a little relief.”
Noah stopped.
Then slowly, he pivoted, returning to the seat with measured calm, his gaze still like ice.
Vivi exhaled shakily.
For now, it seemed she had made the right decision.
She steadied her breath and began, her voice low, laced with fabricated emotion.
“The truth is… back then, you and Kyla were deeply in love. Everyone knew it—you were about to get engaged.”
She paused, watching Noah’s face for any sign of reaction.
“But Sadie—she couldn’t stand it. She hated Kyla for having your heart. Out of envy, she began plotting behind your back. She twisted everything, destroyed your relationship, and when Kyla tried to fight back, Sadie sent her away to Boxing Street in Wheosla. You know the place—crime-infested, lawless. She sent Kyla there to suffer. Alone. With nothing.”
Vivi pressed a trembling hand to her chest.
“Kyla was soft… kind. She never stood a chance against someone like Sadie.”
The corners of Vivi’s eyes reddened, making her look genuinely aggrieved as she said,
“I just couldn’t let this go, so I thought of avenging Kyla. That’s why I planned that car accident. All I wanted was to get rid of that wretched woman, Sadie! I never expected you to risk your own life to save her, Mr. Wall.”
She choked on a sob, and for a moment, it seemed like she was unable to continue.
M0re detailz at glovels.
“That’s roughly what happened.”
Vivi lifted her head then, her expression pitiful.
“Of course, only Kyla knows all the details. If you want to know more, you should consider bringing Kyla back from that place.”
She spoke with such conviction that any ordinary person would believe her words were true.
Noah, however, frowned deeper.
Vivi’s story was plausible enough, but he couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that something was off about it all.
His immediate and inexplicable aversion to this Kyla was clear. Needless to say, it wasn’t the sort of emotion one should harbor toward their beloved.
.
.
.
###Chapter 832:
Noah stood up and glanced down at Vivi.
An unmistakable warning.
“If I find out there’s even a hint of falsehood in your story, I promise that you will find yourself in a situation a hundred times worse than this.”
With that, he turned and left the room.
As soon as the door clicked shut, Vivi dropped her pitiful act.
Three years ago, just before she was arrested, she had received an encrypted message from abroad.
It was from Kyla.
The message was very short.
“I am not dead. He sent me to Wheosia. I’ll be back soon.”
At the time, Vivi thought that Kyla was really dead and that someone was merely playing a prank.
Now that she had some time to think about it, however, she was starting to believe that the message must have been genuine.
The corners of Vivi’s lips curled into a devious smile.
She couldn’t rely on Noah to get her out of this hellhole. But it was all right—as long as Noah somehow brought Kyla back.
Kyla would never stand by and watch her suffer in such a horrid place.
Vivi leaned back in her chair and felt the chill of the metal seep into her skin.noveldrama
Her hands slowly balled into fists.
Sadie and Noah would pay for everything they had done.
Meanwhile, Noah walked out of the prison gates and got into the black sedan parked at the entrance.
Jack was waiting in the driver’s seat. He glanced at the rearview mirror and gauged Noah’s mood.
The man’s expression was even more grim and severe than it had been before he walked inside.

Jack swallowed the words that were on the tip of his tongue.
Leaning back in his seat, Noah closed his eyes and kneaded his temples to ease some of the tension building up inside him.
Vivi’s words were like a mess of thorns that had wrapped itself around his heart.
After a long silence, he finally opened his eyes, his gaze deep and unreadable.
“Jack. Send someone to Wheosia to investigate a place called Boxing Street. Check if a woman named Kyla Wade was sent there three years ago. I also need you to dig up everything about her background. The more detailed, the better.”
He needed to verify everything Vivi had said.
.
.
.
###Chapter 833:
He needed to know how much he could trust her.
“Understood, Mr. Noel,” Jack said without asking any questions.
He started the car and drove away from the prison.
“Where to next, Mr. Noel?”
Noah’s gaze drifted to the scenery flashing outside the window.
He took another moment before saying,
“To Wall Group.”
Today was the day for the public bidding for the plot in the east. The results should be out by now.
It was also a good opportunity to discuss the matter of the factory’s construction with Sadie.
But Noah knew these were all just excuses.
He was going to Wall Group because he desperately wanted to see her.
Her attitude toward him at the hospital yesterday had left him anxious and on edge.
He had barely slept a wink last night.
He needed to see if she was still angry with him, if there was anything he could do to make her feel better.
He needed to know if she had truly given up on him.
Half an hour later, Noah arrived at Wall Group and was led to the top-floor conference room by one of the employees.
The minutes passed into an hour, but the person he was waiting for was nowhere to be seen.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the doors of the conference room opened.
Samuel walked in, followed by another person—Blaine.
Blaine was dressed in his signature tailored but casual suit, and his face wore his customary sardonic grin.
Fresh updates available at ?@lnσνe?s?com
He took one look at Noah seated at the long table, raised an eyebrow, and let out a cheeky whistle.
“Mr. Noel! It looks like you were finally able to spare us some of your precious time.”
His tone didn’t carry the respect one would normally give to the chairman of their partner company.
Noah’s gaze drifted past Blaine and Samuel to the still open doorway behind them.
It was empty. Sadie wasn’t there.
Noah slowly lowered his eyes to conceal his disappointment.
Samuel sensed the shift in the atmosphere and was momentarily at a loss for how to respond.
In the end, he maintained a professional smile.noveldrama

.
###Chapter 834:noveldrama
“Apologies for keeping you waiting, Mr. Noel,” he said, stepping forward. “Ms. Hudson gave us her instructions earlier today. With regard to the construction of the factory in the east of the city, the Wall Group will fully delegate the responsibility to Mr. Castro moving forward.”
Noah’s eyes darted up and landed heavily on Samuel.
“What does Ms. Hudson mean by doing this? Sending a flippant general manager to oversee such a crucial project? Does she think the Burgess Group isn’t worth her personal attention? What does she take us for?”
Despite the calm in his tone, the underlying threat was there.
Samuel’s face showed a hint of unease.
He had expected that Patrick would be difficult to deal with, but that didn’t make his task any easier.
He braced himself and relayed the rest of Sadie’s message.
“You are misunderstanding, Mr. Noel. That’s not what Ms. Hudson thinks at all. She did say that if the Burgess Group has any ions to the current arrangement, you are free to terminate the existing partnership at any time.”
Noah’s hands clenched around the armrests of his chair. He used so much force that his knuckles turned white.
Was Sadie really going to such lengths just to avoid him?
That inexplicable irritation rose in his chest again.
Noah fixed his narrowed gaze on Samuel, his voice growing colder with every word.
“Where is Sadie?”
Samuel bravely met his stare, though he inwardly groaned in helpless frustration.
He shook his head and answered truthfully,
“Ms. Hudson flew to Beversea early this morning. There’s an important collaboration project with Johnson Group that requires her presence. She likely won’t be back for a few days.”
Noah’s chest tightened even further.
G aln ove ls . com has stories you’ll love
He stood abruptly.
“Since Ms. Hudson isn’t here, the collaboration can wait until she returns.”
He didn’t wait for either man to respond and exited the room with long, resolute strides.
Samuel and Blaine exchanged a glance as Noah left, both a little confused.
Blaine cupped his chin, his carefree expression giving way to a pensive one.
Patrick’s attitude toward Sadie was clearly… special.
Only then did he realize that Patrick had completely ignored him. Not once had he acknowledged his presence.
.
.
.
###Chapter 835:
Beside him, Samuel heaved sigh after sigh.
He shared Blaine’s thoughts—Patrick’s behavior wasn’t about the collaboration; it was about Sadie herself.
For now, however, they could only tackle things one at a time.
Noah stormed out of the building and got into his car.
“To Beversea,” he barked, slamming the car door as he slipped into the back seat.
Jack’s grip on the steering wheel faltered.
What was going on with his boss now? Why the sudden decision to go to Beversea?
He didn’t dare ask these questions out loud, of course, and simply started the engine.
In Beversea, Sadie had just checked into her hotel and was unpacking her luggage when Samuel’s call came through.
“Ms. Hudson, Mr. Noel has left the premises. He told us that the collaboration project can wait until you return. It looks like he wants to discuss it further with you.”
Sadie’s fingers tightened around her phone.
After a few seconds of silence, she said,
“All right. Find someone reliable and make them the official liaison with the Burgess Group’s team. There’s no need to go through Mr. Noel from now on.”
“I understand, Ms. Hudson,” Samuel replied, then hung up.
Sadie tossed her phone aside with a heavy sigh. Her frustrations were starting to weigh on her.
Even so, she pushed the image of Noah out of her mind.
Thankfully, a knock came at her door, interrupting her gloomy thoughts.
The door opened, and Tina poked her head inside.
“Sadie, the dinner banquet with the Johnson Group starts at eight. We should head out soon.”noveldrama
Sadie took a deep breath and composed herself, carefully masking the whirling emotions in her eyes.
Your escape begins with g?lnσνsm
“Got it,” she said with a nod.
After checking her appearance one last time, she grabbed her purse and left the room with Tina.
Sadie had just arrived at the banquet hall of Splendor Hotel when Daren Johnson, CEO of the Johnson Group, walked up to her with a fawning smile.
“Ms. Hudson! I just want to say that I very much look forward to more collaborations between us in the future.”
“Likewise,” Sadie replied, her smile polite and professional.
Daren glanced around and lowered his voice.
.

###Chapter 836:
“Now, about that new energy project—why don’t we sign the contract tonight?”
This was exactly what Sadie wanted. She was eager to finalize these matters as soon as possible.
“Sure thing.”
They exchanged a knowing smile and headed to the private room upstairs.noveldrama
As they approached the door, they overheard sounds coming from inside—sounds that implied ongoing intimate activities.
Daren’s hand was already turning the knob when he realized what was going on.
But it was too late—the door swung open before he could stop it.
Sure enough, they were greeted by a scandalous scene.
A man and a woman were having sex on the luxurious bed, and neither seemed to have noticed that they had been intruded upon.
The woman let out a moan and whimpered,
“Come on, don’t stop!”
Sadie’s brows rose wryly, while Daren stood rooted to the spot.
Finally, the couple noticed their presence and stopped their amorous workout.
The woman lifted her head, her face still flushed, her breathing heavy.
When their eyes met, Daren felt as though he had just run into a solid brick wall. The color immediately drained from his face.
Not once had he imagined he would find his younger sister, Ophelia Johnson, in such an indecent state.
Worse still, the man she was having sex with was the notorious Nathan Higgins.
Daren began to tremble with rage.
The thing was, a marriage alliance had already been arranged between the two families, but Ophelia was promised to Jarrett Higgins, Nathan’s elder brother.
They had reached the point where the elders were already discussing the most auspicious wedding date.

How could Ophelia get involved with her future brother-in-law?
Sadie quickly grasped the gravity of the situation. She quietly took a step back. Clearly, this was not the right moment to discuss business.
“Mr. Johnson, it looks like you have family matters to attend to. I won’t impose on you any further. Let’s reschedule our discussion.”
Her voice pulled Daren back to his senses.
He forced a strained smile in a paltry attempt to hide his embarrassment.
“I deeply apologize for this, Ms. Hudson. Let’s talk another time.”
Sadie gave him a small nod and walked away from the scene.

###Chapter 837:
Once she was gone, Daren let loose.
He strode into the room and slapped Ophelia hard across the face.
Smack!
She clutched her stinging cheek, her eyes filled with tears as she stared at her brother in shock.
“How could you hit me?” Ophelia demanded, sounding aggrieved. “I love Nathan, I truly do! I don’t want to marry that wheelchair-bound Jarrett!”
Jarrett had been in an accident a few years ago, and now he was bound to a wheelchair. It was a well-known fact among high-society circles in Beversea.
Daren’s anger flared even more.noveldrama
“Shut up! Your marriage was decided a long time ago. This alliance is crucial for the future of both the Johnson and the Higgins families. There is no room for any changes!”
He didn’t hold back. He knew his sister had grown up spoiled, but it seemed all that pampering had made her completely lose common sense.
Daren then turned his glare to Nathan, who was leisurely putting his clothes back on, as if nothing monumental had just happened.
Needless to say, his nonchalance made Daren all the more furious.
“Mr. Higgins!” he barked through gritted teeth. “Don’t you think you owe our family an explanation?”
Nathan fastened the last button of his shirt with a chuckle.
“That’s a rather odd question, Mr. Johnson. Ophelia and I are both adults. What else is there to explain?”
Daren’s expression darkened, and his hands clenched into fists at his sides. But he held back this time.
Causing a commotion now would be detrimental to everyone involved.
Daren looked at his sister again, who had the audacity to pout and sulk.
? ? ? gov.? m
“Get dressed and go home right this instant. Let’s just forget this ever happened.”
Then he stormed out of the room. If he stayed there a minute longer, he might really explode.
Ophelia huffed and crossed her arms over her chest.
But when she saw that Nathan was about to leave, she panicked.
“Nathan, where are you going?”
He paused and looked back at her with a teasing smile.
“Show’s over, Ophelia. You should listen to your brother and hurry back home. Jarrett’s waiting for you. Don’t worry, I won’t tell him about today.”
Ophelia was stunned.

###Chapter 838:
“Wait, don’t go! Didn’t you say you would marry me?”
She scrambled from under the covers, but Nathan had already left the room before she could even get out of bed.
Walking into the banquet hall, Nathan instantly spotted Sadie in the crowd. She was engaged in conversation with a handful of other guests.
Nathan could tell right then and there that she was not a simple woman.
After witnessing such an episode, most women would have either fled in horror or run off to gossip among their friends.
Yet here she was—elegant and composed—as she continued socializing with her peers.
She was very special, indeed.
Nathan’s lips curled into a mischievous smile as he made his way to her.
“Ms. Hudson, I’ve heard people say that you are charming—captivating, really—and I must say, you truly live up to your reputation.”
Nathan came to a stop just behind Sadie, leaning in with casual audacity.
A faint trail of cologne mixed with the tang of liquor drifted toward her.noveldrama
Sadie was listening to a business partner, her focus unwavering—until the subtle disruption drew her attention.
She frowned instinctively, turning to see who dared interrupt her, only to come face to face with a teasing gaze.
The effect was immediate. The business partners she’d been speaking with just moments ago visibly stiffened upon seeing Nathan. They mumbled excuses and all but fled.
Sadie didn’t need an introduction. She’d heard plenty about Nathan—the unruly heir of the powerful Higgins family in Beversea.
Their influence ran deep, and his reputation ran wild. Exactly the kind of man she had no patience for.
Without a word, she pivoted, not even offering the courtesy of a nod.
Your next tale lives on g ? lnσ ν ?s, com
Nathan blinked, clearly taken aback by her frosty dismissal.
But rather than offended, he looked intrigued. The corners of his mouth curled into a slow, deliberate smile, his interest clearly piqued.
Nathan extended an arm smoothly across her path, that signature mischievous smile playing on his lips—the kind that had likely opened too many doors with too little effort.
“Come on, Ms. Hudson, don’t be so cold,” he said, reaching casually as if to take her by the arm.
Sadie’s eyes narrowed.
She shifted, ready to dodge him—but someone else moved first.
.
.
.
###Chapter 839:
A hand shot out from behind her—strong, deliberate—and seized Nathan’s wrist mid-motion. In one swift movement, it twisted sharply.
Crack.
“Ah!”
Nathan sucked in a breath, the charm draining from his face in an instant. His smile vanished, replaced by a grimace of pain.
Sadie turned, startled.noveldrama
Noah?
He stood there like a shadow forged from steel—imposing, still. A cold, metallic mask covered most of his face, leaving only his eyes visible—dark, unreadable, and chillingly calm.
What was he doing here?
His gaze locked onto Nathan’s, his grip unmoving.
The air around him seemed to compress, heavy with silent authority.
“Mr. Higgins, before you lay a hand on someone, make sure you can see clearly,” he said flatly, his voice like winter steel. “And make sure you can handle what comes next.”
A single drop of sweat slid down Nathan’s temple.
Nathan looked up, a sharp chill creeping into his chest.
The rumors had circulated for years—of the elusive Patrick from Burgess Group,
a man who never revealed his face, always concealed behind a mask.
Ruthless. Calculated. Unshakable.
And now, standing before him, was a man who matched every whispered detail.
The aura Noah exuded was undeniable—too controlled, too cold, too dangerous to be dismissed.
Nathan forced a strained smile, sweat beginning to bead at his temple. He raised both hands slightly, as though to surrender.
I@?e$t ￠н@я$ ?η и?vε.c?m
“Mr. Noel, it’s a misunderstanding,” he said lightly. “Just a harmless joke with Ms. Hudson, nothing more.”
He wasn’t about to challenge someone like this—not over ego. Not tonight.
Noah stared him down with thinly veiled disdain. Then, with a flick of his wrist, he let go—as if discarding something unworthy of his time.
He turned to Sadie, his attention shifting like a silent command.
Without warning, he took her wrist in his hand.
“Ms. Hudson, I need a word. In private,” he said coolly, his voice cutting through the murmurs around them.
.
.
.
###Chapter 840:
Then, to the surrounding crowd, he added,
“Please, excuse us.”
Nathan remained behind, rubbing his wrist and narrowing his eyes, watching the two disappear.
That wasn’t a business acquaintance.
Noah’s protectiveness was too quick. Too personal.
Their relationship? Interesting.
Meanwhile, Noah’s grip was unrelenting. His strides were swift, and Sadie struggled to keep pace, wincing as his fingers bit into her skin.
“Let go,” she snapped, twisting slightly. “You’re hurting me.”
Sadie raised her voice at Noah.
Noah didn’t respond—not immediately. He kept walking, silent and relentless, until they reached a deserted corridor cloaked in shadow.
Then he stopped so abruptly that Sadie nearly stumbled into him.
She caught herself, breath uneven, words poised on her tongue—but he turned. And before she could react, his tall frame closed in, cutting off her space.
In the next second, she was pressed against the cold wall, its chill seeping through the fabric of her dress.
Noah’s mask loomed close, and for a moment, the only thing she could see was the fire behind his eyes—red-rimmed, wild with something she couldn’t name.
His voice broke through the silence, hoarse and tight.
“Did you come to Beversea for him?”
Noah struggled to understand—what did Nathan have, other than a pretty face?noveldrama
The sheer absurdity of the question, the misplaced jealousy—it was laughable.
Infuriating.
 : gν
Sadie met his gaze, her tone laced with ice.
“I don’t think you have the right to question me, Mr. Noel. Maybe you should save your possessiveness for your pregnant wife. Or do you just enjoy playing both sides?”
Her voice dropped lower.
“But I’m not interested in being the woman whispered about. I’m not interested in becoming your scandal.”
Sadie’s words struck like knives, sinking deep into the soft parts Noah still tried to hide.
Noah’s breath hitched—just slightly.
He knew she was provoking him, pushing him away with brutal precision.
But something in him snapped.
Without warning, he surged forward. His hands caged her in place.

###Chapter 841:
And then, with no room for restraint—he pressed his mouth against hers.
Sadie froze, her body tense with shock—then the reality hit her like a slap, and a wave of humiliation and rage surged through her.noveldrama
She thrashed violently, but Noah held fast, his grip unyielding.
With a flash of defiance, she sank her teeth into his lip—hard.
The sharp tang of blood bloomed between them.
Noah jerked back with a muffled groan, pain etched across his face as his hold slackened.
Without missing a beat, Sadie shoved him away with all her strength.
Then her hand flew up, and she struck him—hard—across the face.
“Noah! That was too far!”
Her chest rose and fell with ragged breaths, her eyes blazing—not with hurt, but with uncontainable fury.
Noah stood there, stunned—his cheek throbbed, but it was nothing compared to the sharp, hollow ache in his chest.
He knew he’d crossed a line. He knew it the moment it happened.
Yet even now, the weight of what he’d done couldn’t stop his spiraling thoughts.
Then—footsteps.
A group of uniformed waiters appeared at the top of the stairs, trays in hand.
They caught a glimpse of the charged scene before them and, wide-eyed and awkward, quickly averted their gazes and passed by in hurried silence.
Sadie, mortified, straightened herself.
The fire in her chest cooled into resolve—she wanted no more of this. No more of Noah.
Without a word, she turned to go.
But Noah panicked. Instinct overrode thought, and he pulled her into a desperate embrace from behind, his arms circling her tightly.
?  ? ? g?ν?
His chin brushed the curve of her neck, and his breath came hot and ragged against her ear.
“I’m sorry, Sadie. I’m so sorry,” he murmured, his voice trembling. “I didn’t mean to—I just… I was scared. Scared of losing you.”
He was terrified she’d already given her heart to someone else.
But her body was stiff, cold against his. The warmth they once shared now felt unreachable. A heavy dread settled in his chest, thick and suffocating.
He knew she might not forgive him—not now.
Still, he needed to explain.
.
.
.
###Chapter 842:
“Sadie… I owe the Burgess family more than I can ever repay,” he said quietly.
His voice faltered, weighted with guilt.
“Hailey’s health has always been fragile. And the baby… the baby has to be kept.” He drew a breath, then added, almost pleading,
“Just give me a little more time. I promise—I’ll make everything right.”
A sudden chill swept through Sadie’s eyes—once vacant, now icy and resolute.
Her lips curled into a bitter, mocking smile.
So he’d finally said it. Not directly, but it was enough.
“Noah, whatever we had… it’s gone,” she said, her voice low and steady.
She looked him straight in the eye, her tone sharp with finality.
“Hailey is your wife now. The mother of your child. And us?”
She paused, letting the silence stretch like a blade between them.
“There is nothing left between us.”
With that, she tore herself from his arms, her movement forceful and absolute.
Without a backward glance, she strode away, each step heavy with determination.
This time, Noah didn’t follow. He couldn’t.
He remained frozen in place, shoulders slumped, eyes hollow with exhaustion that ran deeper than just physical.
A moment later, Jack stepped out from the shadows, his expression tight with discomfort as he took in the sight of Noah—so composed on the surface, yet clearly unraveling inside.
Noah lifted a hand to his brow, massaging the tension that throbbed behind his temples.noveldrama
“Have you made the reservation?”
Jack moved quickly, handing him a keycard with quiet efficiency.
  ? .
“Yes, sir. Same hotel as Ms. Hudson. I booked a suite right next to hers.”
A shadow passed over Noah’s features. He gave a slight nod, the barest flicker of satisfaction darkening his eyes.
Meanwhile, Sadie exited the Splendor Hotel and climbed into the sleek Maybach waiting at the curb.
In the passenger seat, Tina was busy with work emails, her fingers dancing across the phone screen.
Noticing the strange flush on Sadie’s face and the faraway look in her eyes, Tina immediately set her phone aside and turned around, concern tightening her expression.
“Sadie, are you alright? Your face is red… What happened in there?”
Sadie avoided eye contact.
.
.
.
###Chapter 843:
“Nothing,” she said softly.
She wasn’t ready to unpack the storm still brewing inside her.
Turning forward, she addressed the driver, her voice clipped and weary.
“Take us back to the hotel. I’m tired—I just need to rest.”
The driver nodded without question and pulled away from the curb.
As the city lights blurred past the windows, Sadie sat in silence, her thoughts in disarray.
She kept repeating to herself that Noah was dead.
The man she saw back there—he wasn’t hers anymore. He was Patrick now.
Hailey’s husband. The father of her child.
She should have accepted that truth a long time ago.
There was no room left for fragile illusions.
She leaned her head back against the seat and closed her eyes, willing herself to let go—to erase that haunting face from her memory.
The car glided smoothly through the night.
Sadie remained unaware of the sleek, bubblegum-pink Lamborghini trailing them from a careful distance—silent, yet unwavering.
Half an hour later, Sadie’s car pulled into the hotel driveway.
She gently urged Tina to call it a night, then turned toward her own room.
The corridor was still—too still. A subtle unease prickled at her skin.noveldrama
Something wasn’t right.
She slowed her pace.
Behind her, the soft echo of footsteps reached her ears—light but deliberate.
And then, unmistakably, the faint scent of an all-too-familiar perfume lingered in the air.
g?ν.?n –  ? ?
She turned slowly, her eyes sharp and unreadable as she faced the seemingly empty corridor behind her.
“If you’re going to follow me, you might as well show yourself.”
A short silence passed, then a figure sauntered out from the corner at the end of the corridor. The man’s pink shirt immediately stood out, its top three buttons undone to expose a portion of his collarbone.
It was Nathan.
His hands were tucked into his pockets, and his lips were curled into his trademark mischievous smile.
“Very nice, Ms. Hudson. Your senses are quite sharp.”
Every step he took toward Sadie was easy and relaxed.
.
.
.
###Chapter 844:
Sadie, on the other hand, maintained a blank and emotionless demeanor.
Nathan was proving to be a very persistent pest.
He had followed her all the way here from the Splendor Hotel. Just what was he up to?
In any case, she didn’t have the time or the energy to waste on him.
“If you have nothing else to say, Mr. Higgins, then you might as well take your leave. Otherwise, you have half an hour to tell me your purpose for coming here.”
Nathan’s smile froze.
His plan had been to carry on with his carefree attitude and perhaps tease her a little more, but she didn’t give him the chance.
As if to emphasize her point, Sadie cast a pointed glance at her watch.
“Your time starts now.”
Nathan’s lips parted, but he couldn’t find the words. He hadn’t expected her to be serious about the time limit.
He finally shelved his frivolous manner, and his entire expression turned earnest.
Sadie tipped her head at him once, then walked straight into her room.
Nathan touched his nose and followed her in with a wry smile.
The door clicked shut behind him.
Instead of sitting down, Nathan took a moment to look around and take in the interior decor.
When he was done, he found Sadie standing by the floor-to-ceiling window.
“I’m here to talk about the upcoming energy project in Beversea. If you want to maximize the benefits for Wall Group, your best choice is to cooperate directly with the Higgins family.”
Nathan’s tone carried a hint of arrogance as he continued,
“After all, all the shares involved in that project are owned by the Higgins family. The Johnson family…”
He looked to the side and scoffed in disdain.
  @ ν?
“They’re basically just the middleman. Daren used the so-called marriage alliance between our families to convince Jarrett into letting him handle the matter on our behalf.”
Sadie turned to look at him then, her arms crossed over her chest. Her face didn’t betray any of her thoughts or emotions.
“Go on.”noveldrama
Nathan felt a slight surge of assurance at that vague sign of interest on her part.
He took two steps forward to close the distance between them.
“Ms. Hudson, if you change your mind and choose to do business with me instead—” He raised his index finger.
.
.
.
###Chapter 845:noveldrama
“I’m willing to offer an additional ten percent profit to Wall Group.”
Sadie raised an eyebrow. Ten percent was no small amount.
She didn’t know much about the Higgins family in Beversea, but she had heard some rumors here and there.
Nathan, for one, was notorious for his libertine ways.
But the story the public found more interesting was the alleged spat between the brothers, Jarrett and Nathan.
Jarrett was known to be an introvert, and his disability seemed to have only worsened his glum nature. But because he was the elder son, he had been named the family heir.
Nathan, on the other hand, was fit and sociable, but he was always overshadowed by his brother’s position at every turn.
No matter what he achieved, he always seemed to fall short of his brother—who was bound to a wheelchair.
Jarrett was wary of Nathan, of course. That much was evident from how the new energy project had been handled.
Jarrett had elected to go about the matter in a roundabout way, using his fiancée’s family to strike a partnership with Wall Group instead of involving Nathan directly.
This way, he was doing the Johnson family a great favor, thereby solidifying the marriage alliance, and at the same time, he was able to keep the lucrative project firmly in his grasp. It was a pretty clever strategy.
Sadie smiled at that thought.
She met Nathan’s eyes, her gaze probing.
“So you deliberately put on a show with Miss Johnson, then, back at Splendor Hotel?”
She had no qualms about being blunt.
It was now clear to her—Nathan had deliberately stalled the contract signing between Wall Group and the Johnson Group with that performance, all while turning Jarrett into a cuckold and humiliating the Johnson family in the process.
gα?ησν?s?com, the place for amazing tales
Nathan froze, looking like a deer caught in headlights, then he threw his head back and laughed heartily.
“I genuinely admire your mind, Ms. Hudson,” he remarked, his eyes glimmering.
Since things had already come to this, he discarded all pretenses and spoke openly.
“To be honest, talking to someone as discerning as you is very refreshing.”
Nathan’s smile faded slightly, and his expression turned somber as he continued,
“I’m sure you’ve already seen through the little schemes my brother and the Johnson family are playing around you. If you choose to cooperate with me, Wall Group can gain far more than the ten percent I’m offering.”
He drew even closer, his eyes burning with purpose.
“If you help me become the head of the Higgins family, I promise you the Higgins family will become Wall Group’s most steadfast ally. We’ll build a partnership that transcends generations.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 846:
This was his true goal—using Wall Group to seize the Higgins family’s legacy.
Sadie remained unfazed throughout his speech. She simply smiled and replied in a casual tone,
“This is a very ambitious endeavor, Mr. Higgins. I only have one question—why should I choose you?”
She stepped closer as well, refusing to be any less intimidating or imposing.
“The current president of Higgins Group and heir to the family fortune is your brother, Jarrett. Even if I decide to sign the contract with the Johnson family, Wall Group and the Higgins family will still be able to maintain a lasting partnership. Why should I take such a huge risk and choose an uncertain future with you?”
Her words struck Nathan’s weakest point.
He pressed his lips into a thin line. She was right—he was nothing at the moment.
But he had come prepared when he decided to follow her all the way here.
“What if I told you that I have something you’ve always wanted, Ms. Hudson? Let’s say, for example… clues about your parents’ whereabouts?”
As he said this, Nathan slowly pulled out his phone, opened his gallery, and handed it to her.
Sadie glanced at the screen—and froze.
The photo was a little blurry, but clear enough for her to recognize the middle-aged couple walking side by side.
They were indeed her long-lost parents.
Sadie’s breath hitched.
Three years ago, she had exhausted all her resources searching for her parents, but the investigation had concluded they were likely victims of an accident.
Eventually, she had come to terms with the painful possibility that they were no longer alive.
But this photo… the timestamp showed the date it was taken—March 2nd, five years ago.
Her head jerked up, her eyes sharp as they locked onto Nathan.
1@?€?? ￠t?êя$ íи galovels.om
“What are you getting at?”
Nathan withdrew his phone and slipped it back into his pocket.
He flashed her that mischievous grin.
“It’s simple, really. If you want to know more, you should consider my proposal, Ms. Hudson.”
He was shamelessly using her parents to negotiate.
Sadie clenched her fists so tightly that her nails nearly pierced her palms.noveldrama

###Chapter 847:
Of all the tactics people had used against her, she hated being threatened the most.
But this time, she had no choice. She couldn’t afford to ignore any information about her parents.
Besides, the conditions Nathan had offered weren’t entirely unreasonable. That ten percent profit was real, tangible.
Still, helping him seize control of the Higgins family would expose her to unspeakable risks and highly volatile consequences.
Sadie closed her eyes and took a slow, steadying breath.
When she looked at Nathan again, her expression was calm, her gaze steady.
Nathan beamed.
“Great! So… shall we shake on it?” he asked, extending his hand.
Sadie didn’t take it. She didn’t even glance at it.
“Wait for me to contact you,” she said coldly.
Nathan didn’t mind her attitude and simply withdrew his hand. After all, he had achieved his goal.
“Well, I shall take my leave now. I look forward to hearing from you, Ms. Hudson.”
With that, knowing she had no interest in continuing the conversation, Nathan turned and left the room.noveldrama
Nathan had just reached the end of the hallway, his finger hovering over the elevator button, when the overhead light suddenly dimmed.
Without warning, a coarse, foul-smelling sack dropped over his head, catching him completely off guard. Darkness swallowed him in an instant.
Before he could shout, a strong hand clamped over his mouth, muffling any sound. He was dragged forcefully in a specific direction.
He thrashed wildly.
“Let go of me!”
? : gν
He was a member of the esteemed Higgins family! Who dared to lay hands on him—especially here, in Beversea, their territory?
As he struggled, he could feel himself being shoved into an enclosed space. The air turned cold, oppressive.
Suddenly, the sack was yanked off. A harsh light flooded his vision, and he squinted, momentarily blinded.
When his sight adjusted, his pupils constricted at the sight before him.
It was Patrick—the man behind the infamous metal mask.
He stood directly in front of Nathan, exuding a menacing aura that made Nathan’s blood run cold. His piercing eyes locked onto him, rendering him frozen on the spot.
Nathan swallowed hard and forced a weak smile.

###Chapter 848:
“Mr. Noel, what’s the meaning of this? Some kind of joke?”
Wasn’t Patrick supposed to have left already? Why was he still here—and confronting him like this?
Noah didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he turned slightly toward Jack, who gave a silent nod before stepping out and shutting the door behind him.
Now, it was just the two of them.
When Noah finally spoke, his voice was flat, emotionless.
“Mr. Higgins, it seems my message at the banquet didn’t quite sink in.”
Nathan’s chest tightened.
Realization began to dawn. He blurted quickly,
“Mr. Noel! This is all a misunderstanding—a huge misunderstanding! I merely noticed Ms. Hudson—”
“Returning alone and felt the need to ensure her safety. That’s all, I promise! Nothing inappropriate happened!”
His face radiated sincerity—like a man desperate to bare his soul to clear his name.
Though known for his flirtatious ways, Nathan valued survival. In moments of danger, he knew better than to provoke someone like Patrick.
This was not a man to trifle with—his actions were often unpredictable, and his protection of Sadie was intense.
Noah’s stare remained flat. He was clearly unconvinced. He wasn’t buying the performance.
Nathan had lingered far too long in Sadie’s suite for it to be just a casual check-in.
“I see.” Noah’s tone was flat, devoid of emotion. “Then tell me—what exactly was the conversation between you and Ms. Hudson? Every detail.”
Nathan’s grin faltered. He glanced nervously at his interrogator.
Noah offered nothing—his demeanor was unreadable.noveldrama
Explore fresh tales at g aln ov el s ; com
Nathan’s conversation with Sadie had touched on sensitive family matters and clues about her parents.
That wasn’t something he could just reveal, especially not to Patrick, who led the Burgess Group and only collaborated with the Wall Group. If Patrick had ties to Jarrett or the Johnsons, revealing those secrets could be fatal. Lying was the only way out.
Nathan’s thoughts scrambled as he pieced together a lie. He let out a sheepish chuckle and scratched his neck awkwardly.
“Honestly, it was trivial. Look, Mr. Noel, I happened to spot Ms. Hudson’s aide, Tina, and she stood out to me—quite the stunner, wouldn’t you agree? So, I merely asked if Ms. Hudson could share Tina’s number. Surely you can relate.”
Noah listened in silence, his gaze narrowing beneath the mask. A flicker of danger darkened his expression.

.
###Chapter 849:
Nathan—infamous for his escapades in Beversea—going after an assistant? And he had the audacity to show up at her boss’s suite just to ask for her number?
No one would believe that story.
It was clear Nathan had no intention of being honest.
Noah didn’t press further.
He turned away and walked to the entrance.
“Escort Mr. Higgins to the adjacent suite,” Noah instructed Jack. “Keep an eye on him. He’s free to leave once he’s ready to tell the truth.”
Without sparing a backward glance, Noah walked out.
Nathan’s expression twisted in panic as he called out, his voice sharp with disbelief.
“Hey! Mr. Noel! What the hell is this? You’re locking me up now?”
Nathan was stunned.
This was Beversea—territory ruled by the Higgins family, a family whose influence was deeply entrenched. And yet here he was, a direct member of that powerful lineage, being detained by the elusive CEO of the Burgess Group?
If word got out, how would he face anyone? What would happen to the family’s carefully maintained reputation?
“You’re overstepping, Patrick!”
Nathan’s eyes darted to Jack, who was walking toward him with an unreadable expression—cold, resolute. It wasn’t a bluff. They might actually hurt him.
Panic surged through Nathan’s chest. Patrick wasn’t playing games.
Taking a deep breath, Nathan tried to calm himself and took a more diplomatic tone.
“Mr. Noel, you know the Higgins and Burgess Groups are partners now. Aren’t you worried that your actions might jeopardize that relationship?”
He forced a faint smile. “I was merely discussing some business matters with Ms. Hudson. The Higgins and Johnson families are negotiating a new energy project with the Wall Group. It involves sensitive family dynamics that shouldn’t be shared lightly with outsiders.”noveldrama
He clung to the pretense of business confidentiality like a lifeline.
   : g?ν
Noah paused, turned slightly, and let out a soft, cold laugh—humorless, chilling. As if Nathan had just made a joke.
Did he really think Noah couldn’t see through such a flimsy excuse?
Before coming to Beversea, Noah had already ordered Jack to dig deep into the region’s power players and recent movements. He knew about the fractured dynamic between the Higgins brothers, the engagement alliance with the Johnson family, and the brewing conflict over the energy project.
So what could Nathan possibly want from Sadie?
.
.
.
###Chapter 850:
There was only one logical conclusion.
Nathan was trying to gain the Wall Group’s support to challenge Jarrett and the Johnsons.
But one question gnawed at Noah.
Sadie was known for her sharp mind and calculated moves. She only ever acted when the benefit was clear. What could Nathan—widely dismissed as a frivolous playboy—have offered her that was compelling enough to secure her cooperation so quickly?
Nathan smirked, his demeanor relaxed as he leaned forward, a hint of mystery lacing his tone.
“It involves the one Ms. Hudson cares about most.” His words were light, but carried a sharp undertone.
A crease formed on Noah’s forehead beneath the mask, an unexpected tightness blooming in his chest.
“Who?”
Nathan cleared his throat and narrowed his eyes with a playful glint before settling back into a more casual stance.
“Actually, it’s…” He let the sentence trail off deliberately, savoring the weight of the moment. “It’s…”
Before he could finish, Noah’s gaze turned icy and sharp.
Nathan’s pulse spiked. Instinctively, he abandoned the theatrics and got straight to the point.
“Her parents.”
The tension in the room eased slightly.
Noah’s expression shifted—just barely. He recalled the report Jack had delivered: years ago, the Hudson family’s business had collapsed, and Sadie’s parents had vanished, presumed dead.
Could it really be them?
Nathan watched the subtle change in Noah’s face with quiet satisfaction. He could tell he had struck the right chord.
 ? ? g?ν?
With a shrug, Nathan slid easily back into his trademark smirk.
“As for anything else… well, Mr. Noel, you could beat me half to death right here, and I still wouldn’t have more to say. We’re businessmen, after all. No one plays their final card without seeing something real on the table first.”
Noah’s frown deepened, but he didn’t respond.
Nathan wasn’t wrong. There was no chance he’d reveal more about Sadie’s parents now.noveldrama
Noah turned his head toward Jack.
Jack instantly understood.

###Chapter 851:
Without a word, he stepped forward, grabbed Nathan by the arm with a grip like iron, and in the next second, hoisted him effortlessly off the floor.
Nathan yelped, stunned, as he was dragged unceremoniously toward the door.
“Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy!” Nathan stumbled over his own feet, yelling in outrage. “Let me go! I can walk, alright? I’m a Higgins, not a criminal! This is kidnapping!”
Jack didn’t even blink. He hauled Nathan straight out the door and slammed it shut behind them.
Noah sank onto the sofa, pressing his fingers to his temples.
Jarrett, Nathan’s elder brother, was cunning, cold-blooded, and ruthless when necessary. He hadn’t secured his position through luck.
For Sadie to choose Nathan in the middle of all this?
It was reckless. Risky. Like standing too close to a burning house just to stay warm.
Whatever she was planning next, it wasn’t going to be simple.
Not long after, Jack returned, standing silently nearby.
“What’s next, boss?” he asked.
Noah thought for a moment, his eyes distant and unreadable.
“Schedule a meeting with Jarrett for tomorrow,” he commanded.
Since Sadie had sided with Nathan, Noah decided to see Jarrett first. Gaining insight into their adversary was essential for navigating the storm ahead.
“Understood, sir,” Jack replied, already turning to carry out the task.
But Noah stopped him. “Hold on,” he added, his tone softening. “Tell the kitchen to whip up something for a hangover—send it to Ms. Hudson’s suite. Don’t say who sent it.”
Though taken aback, Jack lowered his head obediently. “Of course.”
He couldn’t help but privately marvel at Noah’s actions.
Despite his claim of keeping his distance, Noah’s gestures betrayed a lingering tenderness toward Sadie. His subtle and somewhat clumsy concern painted a picture of quiet sorrow.

After leaving the banquet at the Splendor Hotel, Daren made his way hastily to the Higgins family’s home.noveldrama
The earlier scene in the private lounge replayed in his mind, making him wince. What troubled him even more was how informed Jarrett had been.
With trepidation twisting in his gut, Daren stepped into the living room and immediately saw the man in the wheelchair.
Jarrett, facing the darkness beyond the glass, radiated a chilling presence that discouraged any approach.
Wiping his brow, Daren edged forward with caution.
.

###Chapter 852:
The evening had been a complete disaster—not only was the deal with Wall Group hanging by a thread, but the Higgins name had taken a blow. He had to make things right.
“Mr. Higgins,” Daren began, “there was a slight hiccup earlier that caused delays. The paperwork with Wall Group remains unsigned.”
Watching closely for a reaction, he quickly added, “That said, everything’s squared away with Ms. Hudson. Just her signature is missing. Give me one day—no, half a day! By noon tomorrow, I’ll deliver the finalized contract.” He kept his voice steady, avoiding any mention of his sister’s scandalous entanglement with Nathan.
Jarrett slowly pivoted his chair to face him. His complexion was pale, his expression unreadable—yet it sent a sharp chill down Daren’s spine. Without a word, Jarrett flung a photograph onto the table.
The image, clearly taken without notice, showed Nathan stepping out of a hotel, a smirk stretched across his face, with his loud pink vehicle in the background.
As Daren’s eyes fell on it, his breath caught.
That hotel was where Sadie was staying. Nathan had been there? When? Was it possible…?
Panic surged through him. Sweat gathered once again at his temples.
Jarrett’s lips curled into a cold, venomous smile. “My brother didn’t waste a second. He’s moved ahead of us. We’re running out of time.”
His stare pinned Daren in place, the weight of unspoken expectations pressing down hard. “Tomorrow, no excuses—Sadie must sign the contract. If Nathan secures the deal first… I assume you grasp the consequences.”
Daren shivered under the pressure. Jarrett’s order was unequivocal.
The rivalry between the Higgins siblings was no secret.
Although Jarrett held the rightful claim to the CEO position, his disability had diminished his influence in company affairs.noveldrama
Nathan, while notorious for his reckless lifestyle, possessed charisma and unpredictability—two qualities the younger board members found appealing.
gα?ησν?s?com is your fiction sanctuary
Should Nathan manage to forge a partnership with Wall Group and take control of the energy venture, Jarrett’s hold on power would slip even further.
Still, Daren hesitated. Nathan was little more than a privileged young man with minimal clout and a frivolous reputation.
Sadie, head of Wall Group, was sharp and shrewd. Why would she align with someone like Nathan when Jarrett—despite his flaws—offered real influence? What would she gain from such a decision?
“Mr. Higgins, we reached an understanding with Ms. Hudson, and the details have already been finalized. As the head of Wall Group, Ms. Hudson isn’t one to backtrack on decisions, is she?” Daren said hesitantly, trying to gauge the situation.
A trace of annoyance flashed across Jarrett’s expression. His eyes sharpened, and a dry laugh escaped his lips. “You underestimate my brother. Since he dared get close to Sadie, he must be confident in whatever leverage he holds.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 853:
It was clear Jarrett had no interest in continuing the discussion. “Do as I’ve instructed. When it’s over, you will gain significantly.”
Daren knew there was no room for negotiation. The Higgins’ dominance far overshadowed the Johnsons’, and Jarrett was known for his merciless nature. Crossing him would lead to severe consequences.
Considering the stakes, Daren buried his hesitation and managed a strained grin. “Of course, Mr. Higgins. I’ll handle it first thing tomorrow.”
Jarrett studied him, his gaze laced with contempt. Then, as if reminded of something, he tapped the armrest of his wheelchair with idle fingers.
“By the way,” he remarked offhandedly, “the twenty-fifth of this month is a good day. Let’s schedule my marriage to Ophelia for that day.”
Daren’s grin vanished.noveldrama
The twenty-fifth? That was only days away. So soon?
After everything that had unfolded…
Images of his sister’s entanglement with Nathan collided with Jarrett’s sudden declaration, and Daren’s face flushed, stinging with the weight of shame.
Daren’s throat tightened, and for a fleeting moment, he was completely at a loss for words.
Jarrett picked up on his hesitation immediately. His brows knitted together, and a flicker of irritation crept into his tone.
“What is it? Not pleased with the date? Or have you and your sister suddenly developed second thoughts about this union?”
The jab jolted Daren out of his daze.
He swallowed the rising shame and forced a strained smile—though it wavered at the corners.
“No, not at all. The date is… perfect. Ophelia marrying you is nothing short of an honor. Our entire family is overjoyed.”
But the words rang hollow, each syllable thick with bitterness he could barely conceal. His sister had disgraced the Johnson name beyond repair. Yet now that things had come this far, he had no choice but to endure it. Pride had to be sacrificed for the sake of survival.
g?ν.0, ? ? ?
Jarrett, unmoved by the thin layer of courtesy, turned his wheelchair toward the study. His voice was clipped and cold.
“Then it’s settled.”
Daren exited the house in a fog.
Ophelia was nothing if not stubborn. And now, she was hopelessly infatuated with that scoundrel Nathan. Convincing her to marry Jarrett seemed as impossible as catching the wind with bare hands.
And then there was Sadie—she had witnessed that disgraceful scene in the private room.
.
.
.
###Chapter 854:
Although he had acted swiftly to suppress the fallout, issuing strict orders to keep everything under wraps, there was no telling what Sadie might do. She could very well use the incident as leverage—or worse, inform Jarrett directly.
If Jarrett ever found out how thoroughly Ophelia had humiliated him, the fragile alliance between the Johnsons and the Higgins would collapse in an instant.
What choices did he even have left?noveldrama
A wave of dizziness washed over Daren as his temples throbbed with mounting pressure. He returned home, his thoughts a chaotic spiral of dread and desperation.
The moment he stepped inside, the butler approached, visibly distressed. His lips parted, but no words came.
Daren’s stomach dropped. His voice came out sharp.
“Just say it.”
The butler finally bowed his head and spoke, his voice low and cautious.
“Sir, since Miss Johnson returned, she’s been in hysterics. Crying nonstop, throwing fits in her room… She said she doesn’t want to live anymore. A few minutes ago, she tried to jump from the balcony. The staff managed to stop her just in time. She’s locked herself in now—won’t open the door, won’t see anyone.”
Daren’s expression darkened, his jaw tightening. His sister had been spoiled beyond reason. And now, in the middle of a crisis, she chose to spiral into melodrama instead of facing the consequences of her actions.
Grinding his teeth, he strode to Ophelia’s door and knocked sharply.
“Ophelia. Open the door.”
There was no answer—only the broken sound of muffled sobs, barely audible through the thick wooden door.
g?ν.0 – Next part
Daren’s patience snapped.
“Break it down,” he barked at the servants.
But before they could move, the door flew open from the inside.
Ophelia stood there—eyes red and swollen, her face streaked with tears, a mess of heartbreak and indignation. Her voice trembled with desperation and wounded pride.
“Daren! Were you really going to break the door down? Don’t you love me anymore? I told you—I won’t marry Jarrett! I won’t spend the rest of my life with a cripple! How can you ask me to live like that?”
In that moment, the last trace of brotherly affection Daren had been clinging to vanished. He exhaled a weary sigh.
“Ophelia, if you still want to keep your place in the Johnson family—if you want to keep living in luxury and comfort—then you will marry into the Higgins family without another word. Our future is tied to Jarrett now. If he rises, we rise. If he falls, we fall with him.”
He paused, his voice cooling, his eyes hard with warning.
.
.
.
###Chapter 855:
“As for those childish fantasies… you’d be wise to let them go. I’ve already finalized everything with Jarrett. The wedding is set for the 25th. You’ll stay home and prepare. That’s final.”
Ophelia’s face crumpled. A raw, anguished cry escaped her lips.
“No! I won’t! I’d rather die than marry that cripple!”
She jabbed a trembling finger at him, fury pouring from her voice.
“If you’re so eager to please Jarrett, then why don’t you marry him yourself?”
Daren’s expression hardened. The color drained from his face. She had gone too far.
There was no reasoning with her anymore—only containment.
Without another word, he turned to the butler. His voice was clipped and cold.
“Restrain her. From this moment on…”
From this moment on, she doesn’t leave this room unless I say so.
The butler flinched but obeyed without hesitation.
“Yes, sir.”
Ophelia froze, unable to believe what she was hearing. Then fury erupted—she stomped her foot, tears spilling down her cheeks in helpless frustration.
“Let me go! You can’t do this! Daren! How could you? I’m your sister!”
But Daren didn’t stop. He didn’t even glance back.
She had crossed every line imaginable. At this point, she was a liability—one he couldn’t afford. She had to be confined, watched closely, and given no opportunity to see Nathan or derail the wedding plans.
The door slammed shut behind him and locked with a heavy, final click.
 с g?
Two servants held Ophelia firmly as she kicked and twisted, her voice breaking into ragged sobs and furious curses.
Her chest heaved with rage, and bitterness scorched every breath.
Why should she be forced to marry a cripple?
Jarrett, with his cold eyes and lifeless legs, could never compare to Nathan—her Nathan—charming, vibrant, everything Jarrett wasn’t.
No one could make her go through with this.
She would never marry Jarrett—no matter the cost.
Daren had barely slept a wink all night.
By morning, faint shadows clung beneath his eyes, and his complexion was pale as he drove to the Emerald Hotel.
He adjusted his tie, forced a pleasant smile onto his face, and took a steadying breath.noveldrama
Jarrett was applying more pressure by the hour, and Daren couldn’t afford another misstep.
The contract had to be signed—soon.

###Chapter 856:
He spotted his target the moment he stepped into the hotel lobby.
Tina, Sadie’s assistant, sat by the window in the lounge, casually sipping her coffee.
Daren felt a jolt in his chest.
Squaring his shoulders, he lifted his chin and approached at a brisk pace.
“I wasn’t expecting to see you this early, Miss Delgado.”
Tina paused, then calmly set her cup down and looked up.
When she saw that it was Daren, she stood and greeted him politely.
“Good morning, Mr. Johnson.”
Daren rubbed his hands together, his urgency barely concealed.
“Is Ms. Hudson here as well? I need to speak with her. It’s rather important.”
Tina gave him a mild look of apology and shrugged.
“What unfortunate timing, Mr. Johnson. Ms. Hudson left early this morning. She had plans to go shopping with a friend. Her son’s birthday is coming up, and she insisted on picking out the gift herself. She probably won’t be back until this evening. Perhaps you can schedule a meeting another time?”
Daren’s smile faltered. He blinked twice.
That excuse sounded a little too convenient.
Had that bastard Nathan gotten to her first?
A cold unease crept into his chest, but he kept his expression composed—even if his smile had grown slightly stiff.
“I see. How unfortunate, indeed. Well, picking out a gift for the little one is certainly important.”
 ?: g?ν?
He reached into his jacket, pulled out a business card, and handed it over.
“Please let Ms. Hudson know to give me a call once she returns. I’ll stop by whenever she’s free.”
Tina accepted the card with both hands, her smile courteous and professional.
“Of course.”
She gave a slight bow and added,
“I’m sorry that you came all this way for nothing, Mr. Johnson.”
Daren waved it off with exaggerated grace, though his smile had grown even more strained.
“It’s no trouble. Well, don’t let me keep you, Miss Delgado.”
He turned and strode out of the hotel. If he stayed a minute longer, he knew his expression might finally betray what he was truly feeling.noveldrama
That damn woman! Why on earth was she out shopping at such a critical moment?
She had to be doing it on purpose.
.
.
.
###Chapter 857:
Rage simmered in Daren’s chest, but he knew all too well there was nothing he could do—except swallow it down.
He got into his car and drove off, still huffing with frustration.
Unbeknownst to him, Sadie and Nathan were seated inside the Time Café right next to the hotel, having seen the entire scene unfold.noveldrama
Sadie lifted her cup and took a slow sip of her coffee.
When she looked up, Nathan was flashing his signature roguish grin.
“So, what’s your next move?” she asked coolly.
She couldn’t avoid Daren forever—at best, she was just buying a little more time.
Nathan’s eyes sparkled with mischief as they drifted to her hand resting on the table.
It was slender, her nails dainty and clean.
His smile deepened as he slowly reached out, placing his hand over hers.
Sadie’s brow twitched, and a flicker of distaste crossed her face.
Her reaction was immediate. She flicked her wrist free and swatted his hand away.
“Hands off. Just say what you came to say.”
Nathan leaned back, rubbing his nose sheepishly.
Sadie, it seemed, was immune to his charms.
What a pity.
Nathan inhaled sharply and grinned.
“You really have no romantic bone in your body, do you, Ms. Hudson?”
Discover new content now g?lnσνe?s?c?m
But before Sadie could respond, the mischief in his expression gave way to something more serious.
His position within the Higgins family was precarious at best. Given Sadie’s intelligence, he figured she’d understand without needing the full explanation.
Snatching Jarrett’s project outright would only unite the old geezers in the clan against him.
And if that happened, Nathan could forget about forming new partnerships—he’d be lucky not to get kicked out of the family altogether.
“I actually have a solution that works for both of us,” he drawled.
Sadie clicked her tongue impatiently.
“Just say it. I don’t have time for your games.”
Nathan closed his eyes briefly, a flicker of embarrassment crossing his face.
Sadie really didn’t give him an inch.
He cleared his throat and said,
“I may need a small favor from you before we put this plan into motion, Ms. Hudson. I need you to help me keep Mr. Noel in check.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 858:
Sadie froze mid-sip, her gaze lifting slowly from her cup, curiosity flickering faintly in her eyes.
What was he getting at? And why bring up Noah?
She calmly set her cup down.
“Mr. Noel and I have nothing to do with each other,” she said coolly.
Nathan nearly laughed out loud.
Last night at the hotel, Patrick had looked at him like he wanted to tear him apart on the spot.
Nathan was convinced he’d barely made it out alive. Even now, the memory of those dangerously cold eyes sent a chill through him.
Nothing to do with each other?
Not a chance.
But time was tight, and the dice had already been cast.
There was no turning back now.
Nathan took another deep breath and made up his mind.
“Why don’t we get engaged? That way, I’ll have a legitimate reason to rein in the old-timers in the Higgins family.”
Sadie had just taken a sip of her coffee and nearly choked at his words. She broke into a coughing fit, trying to process what he had just said.
When she finally caught her breath, she dabbed the corners of her mouth and shot Nathan an exasperated glare.
“Nathan! Do you even hear yourself right now?”
L?t?st chαpt?rs in glnovels.
Was there something seriously wrong with him? He never seemed to take anything seriously.
Nathan quickly raised his hands in defense.
“Okay, wait, just hear me out! It’s only temporary, and strictly business. Once I’ve secured my place in the Higgins family, you’re free to call off the engagement, and I won’t stop you. I’ll go along with whatever you decide.”
His face was unusually earnest, and if she looked closely, Sadie might have even seen a trace of pleading. He really was good at acting.
Sadie’s upper lip curled at his theatrics, caught somewhere between annoyance and amusement.
As absurd as the idea was, Nathan’s proposal did have merit.
Jarrett had allied with the Johnson family, and together, their combined power posed a serious threat.
Nathan, on the other hand, was isolated and outnumbered. He needed something significant to back him if he hoped to challenge Jarrett’s authority.

###Chapter 859:
And truth be told, marrying her would be the fastest, most straightforward way to solidify his footing within the Higgins family.
But then… Noah.
As soon as his name crossed her mind, Sadie shut the thought down.
He was Hailey’s husband now, the father of her child.
Whatever feelings she had once harbored should have ended long ago.
Why should she care what he thought about her engagement to another man?
Besides, this was just another business deal. A mutually beneficial agreement.
Nothing more. No emotions involved.
Sadie quietly fiddled with her coffee cup.
When she looked at Nathan again, her eyes were clear and filled with resolve.
“Deal.”
Nathan lit up instantly, lifting his coffee cup in a toast.
“To our partnership!”
“Once this is over,” Sadie said before he could get carried away,
“I want to know everything about my parents. Every last detail. No secrets.”
Nathan nodded without hesitation.
“You’ve got it. No details spared, I swear.”
If it meant getting what he wanted, he was more than willing to spill everything.
In an instant, Sadie slipped back into her composed, businesslike demeanor.
M ?ρ  ν.
“I’ll have the PR department announce our engagement right away.”
Nathan gave her a thumbs-up.
“Efficient as always, Ms. Hudson!”noveldrama
But even as the words left his mouth, a keen sense of foreboding crept into his chest.
If Patrick caught wind of this…
Would he even survive the fallout?
It seemed clear now—until Patrick left Beversea, Nathan needed to keep a low profile. Very low.
Daren’s mind was still in turmoil when he arrived at the Higgins estate.
The events of the past two days weighed heavily on him. First, the scandalous affair between his sister and Nathan, and now the matter of the unsigned contract.
He did his best to compose himself, only to stop short upon entering the living room.
Jarrett was seated in his wheelchair as usual, his back to the door.
Across from him sat a man wearing a sleek, silver mask.
.
.
.
###Chapter 860:
Daren’s heart skipped a beat.
What was Patrick doing here?
He recalled hearing that the elusive Mr. Noel of the Burgess Group had attended last night’s banquet. Despite searching every corner of the venue, Daren had failed to catch even a glimpse of him.
Later that evening, he overheard someone mention that Patrick had left the party early—with Sadie.
At the time, Daren hadn’t paid it much attention. His mind had been consumed by other, more immediate concerns.
Patrick’s reputation preceded him—a legend in the business world, renowned for his ruthless strategies and meteoric rise. The Burgess Group had once teetered on the brink of collapse, but under his leadership, it had been revitalized, rising to become a powerful force in the economic landscape—all in just three years.
Daren didn’t dare be careless.
He quickly composed himself and stepped forward with a courteous smile.
“Mr. Higgins,” he greeted Jarrett first, before offering a respectful nod to the masked man. “Mr. Noel.”
A wave of unease washed over him. Patrick had an undeniable presence. Even seated, he exuded authority that pressed down like a weight.
Daren silently prayed the man wasn’t here to stir up more trouble.
Noah glanced at Daren briefly, nodded in acknowledgment, then looked away without a word.
Daren’s face burned with embarrassment. It felt like slamming into a wall of ice, and now he didn’t know what to do with himself.
Your escape begins at g?lnσνs?com
Thankfully, Jarrett chose that moment to break the silence.
He maneuvered his wheelchair to face Daren, his pale face betraying no emotion.
“How did it go? Have you secured the contract?”
Daren’s heart sank, but he forced a smile.
“I went to the hotel early this morning hoping to meet with Ms. Hudson, but her assistant informed me that she had already left by the time I arrived.”
There was no way he was going to admit that Sadie’s assistant had essentially dismissed him with a flimsy excuse.
But Jarrett didn’t seem surprised. He turned to Noah with a faint, wry smile.
“It appears you were right, Mr. Noel. My dear brother is quite a handful.”
Daren’s brows drew together in confusion. What were they talking about?
Noah remained unbothered, his gaze deep and unreadable behind the silver mask. His voice was steady as he replied,
“Nathan may be sly and deceitful, but he poses no real threat. He might have managed to mislead Sadie with a few tricks, but it doesn’t affect your position. The senior members of the Higgins Group recognize you as the rightful heir—no one else. Nathan can scheme all he wants, but he can never undermine your authority.”

###Chapter 861:
Jarrett exhaled softly, seemingly reassured by Noah’s words.
Noah noted the reaction with quiet satisfaction. He needed Jarrett stable, at least for now—until he uncovered just how much Nathan truly knew about Sadie’s parents. He couldn’t afford chaos, not yet.
Daren’s eyes lit up at Noah’s statement. He nodded eagerly, latching onto the opportunity to redeem himself.
“You’re absolutely right, Mr. Noel!” he said with exaggerated enthusiasm.
“Nathan has a reputation for scamming his way through high society. Ms. Hudson is a pure and trusting woman—it’s no surprise he was able to draw her into one of his traps!”
Jarrett blinked, his brows briefly furrowing before his expression relaxed again.
Lost in thought, he simply nodded, offering no further comment.
The pressure that had gripped the living room seemed to lift momentarily.
At that instant, rapid footsteps echoed from outside.
The Higgins family’s butler burst in, nearly stumbling as he entered. Alarm contorted his features, and his tie hung askew.
“Sir! Bad news!” he blurted out, nearly breathless.
Jarrett’s expression hardened, his forehead creasing in irritation.
“Compose yourself! This is unacceptable!”
Too rattled to even wipe the perspiration trickling down his face, the butler looked as though he might collapse.
“Mr. Higgins, the Wall Group just made a public announcement—through their official press network. They claim that Ms. Sadie Hudson and Nathan are in love… and are getting married! The news is already spreading like wildfire!”
Your next chapter is here gα?ησνs?com
Instantly, the energy in the room shifted violently.
Noah, his face hidden behind the mask, gave nothing away—but the air around him turned glacial.
Jarrett’s fingers clenched around his coffee cup.
Daren stood frozen, utterly thunderstruck.
Crash!
The ceramic cup shattered against the floor as Jarrett hurled it, shards scattering in every direction. Rage twisted his features into something monstrous.
“So my dear brother plans to marry into the Wall family?” he hissed, jaw clenched. “All this… in just forty-eight hours?”
Daren blinked in disbelief. Nathan? Marrying the chairwoman of Wall Group? It felt surreal.
If the wedding actually happened, Nathan’s status would soar overnight. Backed by one of the country’s most influential corporations, he would become untouchable.

###Chapter 862:
And those fickle elders who once pledged loyalty to Jarrett? They would shift their allegiance without hesitation.
The inheritance Jarrett thought secure might suddenly hang in the balance.
Panic sparked in Daren’s chest. Was it time to reconsider his loyalty? Could he truly bet his future on a man bound to a wheelchair?
Swallowing his fury, Jarrett slowly turned to the unmoving figure beside him.
“Mr. Noel… what’s your take?”
Noah’s hand curled slightly on his thigh, though his demeanor didn’t waver.
He gave a ghost of a smile—empty, sharp as frost.
“Your brother is certainly daring,” he said, his voice calm and unwavering.noveldrama
“But remember, Sadie still bears the name of Noah Wall’s spouse. From what I gather, the elders in your family aren’t likely to endorse this union. And Sadie has a cousin-in-law—Briley Wall. Don’t underestimate her. So don’t lose sleep just yet, Mr. Higgins.”
Jarrett listened, the gears in his mind already turning. The Wall lineage had always been tangled—a web of politics and private wars.
Yet, wasn’t Noah supposed to be dead? What sway could a ghost possibly hold in the affairs of the living?
Without another word, Noah stood. The force of his presence was suffocating, the air itself seeming to bend around him. No one dared meet his eyes.
“I have matters to attend to. I’ll take my leave.”
With that, he exited, each step deliberate, unhurried.
Jarrett exhaled shakily, shaken by the sheer dominance Noah carried. His brows knit together in deep thought.
g?ν.k? –    
Why had Patrick come here to say all that? Was it a gesture of goodwill? Or perhaps… something else?
A realization crept into his mind—what if Patrick harbored feelings for Sadie?
His tone when discussing her… it hadn’t been neutral. There had been something beneath it—unspoken, but unmistakable. It now seemed entirely possible.
Still, Nathan remained the immediate threat.
Jarrett shook off the thought, his eyes darkening with renewed intensity. He turned sharply to Daren, who still hadn’t recovered.
“Assign someone to track Nathan’s movements. And arrange a private meeting with Ms. Hudson.”
Daren blinked, startled. “You want to meet her… personally?”
Jarrett’s glare was sharp enough to cut through steel. “What do you think I mean?”
Daren’s chest tightened. He lowered his head quickly in submission.
Jarrett’s voice turned cold and clipped.

###Chapter 863:
“Don’t forget—we’re bound together now. There’s no room for betrayal. The wedding with Ophelia is already scheduled. It will happen before this month ends.”
A shiver raced down Daren’s spine. He buried his earlier doubts beneath a forced, obedient smile.
“Of course, Mr. Higgins. The Johnson family and the Higgins family are united—always. You have my full support.”
Jarrett nodded, satisfied.
Outside, Noah slipped into the black vehicle waiting in front of the villa. Jack glanced up from his phone, the headline still glowing on the screen:
Nathan Higgins to Wed Wall Group Chairwoman!
He looked at Noah through the rearview mirror.
Though the mask concealed most of his face, the storm simmering beneath Noah’s calm exterior was unmistakable.
Jack’s fingers tightened around the steering wheel. He spoke carefully.
“Sir, should I dispatch someone to take care of Nathan?”
Noah turned slowly. A faint smirk tugged at his lips—cold and razor-sharp.
“Let him keep breathing a little longer. Death would be far too kind.”
Noah returned to the Emerald Hotel.
The moment he stepped into the lobby, he nearly collided with someone.
The man was humming to himself, steps light, his entire face glowing with smug satisfaction.
Nathan.

Noah’s pace slowed, his expression turning cold—as if the temperature around him had dropped ten degrees.
Behind him, Jack felt a wave of silent pity—for Nathan.
He had just walked straight into disaster. They hadn’t even begun looking for him, and here he was, offering himself up on a silver platter.
Nathan spotted them too.
His grin froze mid-expression. His eyes widened like he’d just seen a ghost.noveldrama
Why was Patrick here again? Was this man haunting him? This couldn’t be real—it had to be a nightmare. He tried to reason with himself, but his legs moved faster than his thoughts. He turned and bolted.
Run. Run now. Staying would mean trouble. He wasn’t stupid enough to stick around.
Noah’s lips curled into a cold, knowing smirk. He lifted his chin slightly and exchanged a look with Jack.
Jack understood immediately.

###Chapter 864:
Without a word, he darted forward and caught up with Nathan in seconds.
Before Nathan could even yell, Jack seized his arm, twisted it hard, and flipped him over his shoulder.
Bang!
Nathan hit the marble floor with a loud, painful thud.
Guests in the lobby jumped at the sound, faces draining of color. They quickly turned away, pretending not to see anything, eager to steer clear of whatever was happening.
Nathan felt like his entire skeleton had been rearranged. His vision blurred; his ribs screamed in pain. Cold sweat clung to his skin.
He gasped, breathless.
“Ow—ow! For crying out loud! That hurts like hell! Go easy, man!”
“You’re gonna break me in half!”
Noah strolled over, unhurried, stopping right in front of him.
Nathan tried to push himself up, but Jack’s hand pressed firmly on his shoulder, keeping him down.
Pinned and out of options, Nathan forced his signature roguish grin.
“Mr. Noel! What a surprise, running into you again!” The smile on his face looked more like a grimace than anything pleasant.
“Back from a trip, huh? Still looking sharp as ever!” Even he cringed at his own words.
“So, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be on my way. Got urgent business to attend to, so I won’t keep you.”
His eyes flicked to Jack, who stood like a statue beside him. The man didn’t move. Didn’t blink. No chance of slipping away.
Find the magic on g?lnσν?s?
Noah finally spoke, his voice like a blade sliding across ice.
“Since we’ve crossed paths, Mr. Higgins, I’d say the timing is perfect. There are a few things we need to discuss.”
Nathan’s stomach dropped.
Before he could come up with a pitiful excuse, Jack grabbed his arm and hauled him off the floor, dragging him toward the elevator.
“Hey, hey, hey! I can walk! Seriously, I can walk on my own!” Nathan protested, but it was like arguing with a wall. The elevator doors slid shut behind them.noveldrama
Not long after, Nathan was thrown into a room like a sack of potatoes.
The moment Jack let go, he scrambled to his feet, slapping on his most flattering smile. He rubbed his hands together, nearly bowing as he approached Noah.
“Mr. Noel! Please, hear me out!”
He raised a hand like he was taking a solemn oath.
“The engagement? Totally fake! Just for appearances! A pure business arrangement, I swear! I have zero—absolutely zero—intentions of marrying Ms. Hudson! Cross my heart!”

###Chapter 865:
Noah’s cold eyes swept over him. The man knew his place.
“She wouldn’t look twice at you anyway.”
The words were flat, but they hit like a slap.
Nathan flinched, his grin twitching at the edges.
Ouch. Brutal. True—but brutal.
He swallowed hard, too scared to argue.
Noah didn’t waste time.
“What’s your next move?”
Nathan froze. His mind raced. How was he supposed to answer that?
He glanced at the door, wondering if he’d even make it out alive after this.
The conversation. The way Patrick guarded Sadie was borderline terrifying. Just thinking about it sent a shiver down his spine.
Under the growing weight of Noah’s icy stare, Nathan finally spoke, his voice wavering.
“Tomorrow, I plan to take Ms. Hudson to Higgins Manor to pay respects to the elders.”
The moment the words left his mouth, the atmosphere shifted. Behind the mask, Noah’s eyes darkened like storm clouds ready to break. It felt like a dagger had been unsheathed—poisoned and aimed directly at him.
Even Jack, who had been standing calmly a few steps away, took a subtle step back, as though instinctively bracing for impact.
Nathan instinctively recoiled. He trembled like a leaf caught in a relentless storm. And then, driven by sheer survival instinct, he gathered enough nerve to straighten his shoulders.
“W-we’re in this together now. If anything happens to me, Ms. Hudson will definitely be upset.”

It wasn’t a threat. More like a desperate plea for mercy.noveldrama
Jack blinked—then, inwardly, he gave a silent nod of admiration. Bold move. Using Ms. Hudson as a human shield? Either Nathan was a master strategist or a complete fool signing his own death warrant.
Noah didn’t take it well.
His chest rose and fell in sharp, controlled breaths. The fury around him thickened, suffocating the air itself. His jaw tightened so hard, the sound of grinding teeth was barely contained.
He raised a hand and pointed straight at Nathan.
“Jack. Make sure Mr. Higgins is properly treated.”
Then he turned on his heel and walked out, his posture rigid, his aura like frost. The door slammed shut behind him with a finality that made the walls tremble.
.
.
.
###Chapter 866:
Nathan stood frozen, staring at the door, stunned.
“Properly treated”? What did that mean?
He turned slowly—and found Jack advancing toward him, cracking his knuckles as he came. His expression was unreadable, but his eyes told another story. Cold. Calculating. Focused.
Nathan swallowed hard and offered a shaky grin.
“Hey, buddy, can we maybe talk this out? We’re civilized men, right? Let’s use our words—no need for fists.”
Jack didn’t answer.
There was no escaping the beating today. Nathan’s stomach sank. He glanced at the floor, then back at Jack.
“Okay, okay. Just—maybe not the face? I still need it to make a living.”noveldrama
At that exact moment, the door to the adjacent room creaked open.
Sadie froze when she saw Noah standing just outside. Her first instinct was to shut the door and retreat.
What was he doing here?
Noah’s eyes darkened. He moved without hesitation. Before she could react, he gripped the handle and pushed the door open, stepping inside.
Caught off guard, Sadie took a step back, her expression hardening.
“Mr. Noel, don’t you think it’s rude to barge into someone’s room like this?” she said coldly. “Neither of us is single now. If anyone finds out we’re alone in here, it wouldn’t look right. Please leave.”
Every word was deliberate, each one carefully drawing a line between them.
1E$? €?S 1? gɑlοv?l?.сo
Shouldn’t he be with Hailey? Why was he here?
Her cold dismissal pushed Noah over the edge. The frustration he’d been suppressing broke free.
Without a word, he stepped forward and pulled her into his arms.
He leaned down, his breath brushing against her ear as he spoke, voice uncharacteristically soft.
“Sadie, I know you only got engaged to Nathan to deal with Jarrett. But you don’t have to go this far. Nathan’s not worth it.”
He could give her everything—so why did she keep pushing him away?
Sadie froze for a beat, then shoved him back with force. She moved quickly, putting distance between them.
How dare he?
“My affairs are none of your business, Mr. Noel.”
She turned to the intercom and pressed the button.
“Please send security to my room. There’s an intruder.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 867:
The voice on the other end responded promptly, assuring her that assistance was on the way.
Sadie hung up and turned back to Noah, her gaze icy.
“Will you leave on your own, Mr. Noel, or should I wait for security to escort you out?”
She didn’t flinch. Not even slightly.
Noah’s jaw tightened. His chest felt heavy, like something had dropped inside and refused to move.
He clenched his fists, struggling to keep himself in check.
But he didn’t say a word.
He turned and walked out.
After Noah left, Sadie’s rigid frame finally eased. She made her way to the couch and sank into it, lifting her fingers to soothe the pounding in her temple.
Noah again. Always him.
He already had Hailey and a picture-perfect household—why couldn’t he just stay away? What more could he possibly want?
Still, even in his absence, a strange twitch in her right eyelid wouldn’t stop. A creeping dread settled in her chest, tightening like a knot she couldn’t undo.
Then her phone lit up with a sudden ring. Tina’s name flashed on the screen.
Pushing down the irritation bubbling inside her, she answered.
“Hello, Tina. What’s going on?”
Tina’s voice carried tension.
  ?: ν．
“Ms. Hudson, Daren from Johnson Group reached out again. He said Jarrett requested a sit-down with you.”
A meeting now? Sadie’s lips curved into a frosty smirk. Clearly, this was about her abrupt engagement with Nathan. She wasn’t going to waste energy on Jarrett right now.
“I won’t see them. Keep coming up with excuses to turn them down. Say I’m tied up for the foreseeable future.”noveldrama
Tina didn’t hesitate.
“Got it, Ms. Hudson.”
Once the call ended, Sadie tossed the phone aside.
Jarrett was sharp and merciless, but it didn’t matter. Tomorrow, she would accompany Nathan to Higgins Manor to meet the family. Their paths would inevitably cross. Whatever needed to be said could wait until then.
Next door, in the lavish suite, Nathan lay bruised and broken, blood staining his lip. Every limb throbbed, and he winced with each breath—the picture of defeat.
Jack hovered close by, his expression unreadable.
.
.
.
###Chapter 868:noveldrama
Noah strode in, his face dark, his presence thunderous. His posture made it clear—he was in a foul mood, likely after a setback.
Jack stiffened and quickly stepped aside, arms straight at his sides. Now was not the time to provoke his boss.
Noah loomed over Nathan, eyes cold with scorn, as if he were staring at something beneath him. Without a word, he raised his polished shoe and delivered a brutal kick to Nathan’s side.
A pained howl escaped Nathan as he curled in on himself, gasping.
Noah’s voice came low and flat.
“Get him out of my sight.”
Jack gave a single nod.
“Right away, sir.”
He bent down and hoisted Nathan upright with zero effort, as if lifting a sack of grain.
Nathan hung limp in his grip, too weak to resist.
Out in the corridor, Jack let him go.
As he gazed at Nathan’s battered face, a rare flicker of regret crossed his otherwise impassive expression. But orders were orders.
“My apologies, Mr. Higgins.”
Nathan hit the floor with a dull thud, groaning.
Unexpectedly, tears spilled down his cheeks. He made no effort to hide them.
Instead, he sat there, weeping—shattered.

“You’re all monsters!” he cried, voice cracking. “Just street thugs in designer suits! Does the law mean nothing to any of you?”
His sobs grew louder.
“Patrick is a monster! And Sadie… she’s no different!”
“She signed off on this arrangement too! It’s not just on me! So why am I the only one paying the price—beaten down, humiliated? What did I ever do to deserve this?” Nathan cried out.
Jack hesitated, his brows lifting slightly in surprise. There was something uniquely theatrical about Nathan’s meltdown that, oddly enough, suited him.
He approached with calm composure.
“Mr. Higgins, you’re in bad shape. Let me take you to the hospital.”
Nathan froze mid-sob and lifted his bruised, blotchy face. His glare was venomous. With a sharp swipe, he knocked Jack’s hand away.
“Save your fake concern! I don’t need it!”
Clumsily, he pushed himself up from the floor, legs trembling but full of stubborn resolve. Sniffling, he staggered toward the elevator without a backward glance—drained, disheveled, and deeply disgraced.

.
.
###Chapter 869:
Jack exhaled slowly, then turned back into the suite.
By the floor-to-ceiling window, Noah stood silently, rubbing his temples. His masked expression revealed nothing, but the air around him was taut with tension.
Nathan, that fool, had actually dared to announce an engagement with Sadie. Even if it was a calculated move, it was suffocating. He couldn’t allow it to go any further.
“Set up a meeting with the Higgins family elders first thing tomorrow,” Noah said flatly.
He would go to Higgins Manor himself.
Nathan was clearly using the Wall Group’s name to elevate his position. Noah wasn’t about to stand by and watch it happen.
Jack nodded quietly.
“Consider it done, sir.”
He was beginning to think his boss’s strategies were growing more unpredictable by the day.noveldrama
The next morning, just as Sadie stepped out of the hotel’s main entrance, a loud pink convertible rolled up to the curb.
Nathan leaned casually against the car, hands in his pockets, dressed more tastefully than usual. Oversized sunglasses and a snug mask concealed most of his face. To an outsider, he might have passed for a B-list celebrity—or someone dodging arrest.
Sadie’s pace slowed. Her gaze sharpened. The flashy car and over-the-top appearance screamed Nathan.
She walked up and gave him a once-over.
“Trying out a secret identity today, Mr. Higgins?”

At the sound of her voice, Nathan’s shoulders stiffened. He snapped to attention and pulled off his sunglasses, revealing puffy, exhausted eyes.
Rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly, he mumbled,
“Good morning, Ms. Hudson.”
Straightening up, he scrambled for an excuse.
“Uh… strong UV rays today. Gotta keep the skin safe.”
Even he didn’t sound convinced.
Truth be told, the thrashing he’d received the previous day had left him so bruised, he couldn’t bear the idea of being seen—especially not by Sadie, whose poise and elegance made his sorry state feel even worse.
Before he could say anything more, a flicker of suspicion crossed Sadie’s face.
Her gaze narrowed as she studied the mask covering his features. It didn’t add up—no one needed sun protection at this hour.
A hunch took hold. Without hesitation, she reached forward and yanked the mask from his face.
Just as she suspected, his features were a mess. One side of his mouth was stained with a bluish bruise, and his cheekbone was swollen and distorted. He looked like he’d stepped out of a warzone—beaten and battered.
.
.
.
###Chapter 870:
Why? What had happened? Had Jarrett or Daren gone after him?
Sadie’s brows lifted with a mix of concern and curiosity.
Nathan squirmed under her gaze. He wanted to hide his face, but the shame had already settled deep. He stood there, awkward and exposed.
Being attacked was bad enough—but being targeted on orders from that masked monster? He couldn’t even talk about it. The pain had nowhere to go, bottled up and festering.
As he scrambled for a believable excuse, movement at the hotel entrance caught his eye. Two individuals stepped out.
Nathan froze like he’d been struck again. Forcing a smile, he quickly wiped the distress from his expression.noveldrama
“I… accidentally ran into a tree last night.”
Sadie’s lips twitched. Did he think she was naive? She wasn’t buying it. Her attention shifted past him—to Noah, who had just stepped out of the hotel. Her eyes narrowed as everything began to click into place.
Only someone like Noah would have the audacity to assault a member of the Higgins family so openly. He wielded grudges like weapons.
Noah, playing the part of the casual bystander, strolled toward them, his voice light—as if they’d simply bumped into each other by chance.
“Ms. Hudson, a lovely morning to you. Mr. Higgins—what an unexpected surprise.”
He cast a pointed glance at Nathan, subtle menace hidden behind his smile, then turned his attention back to Sadie.
“I heard you’re heading to Higgins Manor today. As it happens, I have business with the family elders as well. Since we’re headed in the same direction, why not go together?”

Sadie arched a brow, unconvinced.
She hadn’t heard of any collaboration involving the Noel family, the Burgess Group, and the Higgins family. Noah’s timing—and his tone—dripped with something sharper than courtesy.
Before arriving in Beversea, she had already mapped out the network of connections between the city’s powerful families. As far as she knew, the Burgess and Higgins families had never crossed paths in business.
Noah’s sudden involvement with the Higgins elders didn’t sit right with her.
Beneath the mask, Noah’s features tightened—just for a moment.
Sadie lifted her eyes and let out a derisive scoff.
“I had no idea the Noel family and the Burgess Group had suddenly become friends with the Higgins,” she said, her voice laced with sarcasm.
Noah’s expression tightened, but he replied without a hint of discomfort.
“It has just begun.”
Jack, standing nearby, discreetly looked up.
.
.
.
###Chapter 871:
Just the day before, his boss had unexpectedly ordered him to arrange a meeting with several elders from the Higgins family, leaving him confused. Now, everything made sense.
Unable to resist, he added,
“It began yesterday.”
Noah’s cold stare immediately swept over Jack.
That look alone was enough to silence him. Jack quickly pressed his lips together. Silence was safer.
Sadie had no interest in continuing a conversation with a man who clearly refused to keep his distance.
She turned, intending to head straight toward Nathan’s flashy sports car.
But before she could take a step, Noah firmly grasped her wrist.
Without a word, he led her toward the sleek black Maybach parked nearby.
He opened the door, gently but firmly pushed her inside, then followed and locked it with a definitive click.
Sadie stared at him, stunned. She reached for the door handle, only to find it locked.
She turned sharply toward him, her eyes blazing with fury.
“Mr. Noel, you truly have no respect for personal boundaries. I’m on my way to meet my future in-laws. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Do you enjoy meddling in other people’s lives?”
Noah didn’t respond. To him, her words were distant, almost meaningless noise. His expression remained calm and unbothered.
“Drive,” he ordered with quiet authority.noveldrama
Full chapters on g?νc?
Jack didn’t hesitate. He started the engine without a word.
Left alone, Nathan stood beside his bright pink sports car, staring after the black Maybach in disbelief.
Another man had just driven off with his fiancée right in front of him, and there was nothing he could do about it.
He clicked his tongue and gently pressed his fingertips against his swollen cheek.
Those two were both troublemakers. What could he possibly do? He was powerless.
Letting out a long sigh, he opened the door, climbed into the driver’s seat, and followed the black sedan.
Thirty minutes later, both cars came to a stop outside Higgins Manor, nestled at the edge of the city, tucked into the base of the mountains.
Sadie reached for the door handle, but Noah’s hand dropped onto hers, stopping her once again.
She immediately jerked her hand away, irritation spreading across her face like a shadow creeping beneath her skin.
.
.
.
###Chapter 872:
“Mr. Noel, just so we’re clear—your wife is pregnant. And I doubt she knows her husband is out here chasing another woman like a lunatic. If she finds out, can you even imagine what that’ll do to her?”
Noah gave a faint smile. It didn’t reach his eyes. Cold. Lifeless.
“And if she does? Then what?”
The sheer indifference in his voice made Sadie’s chest tighten with heat. She was furious.
She didn’t bother arguing. There was no point.
She pushed the door open and stepped out.
Nathan had been waiting outside and jogged over the moment she appeared.
Sadie didn’t even glance at his face. She took his arm and leaned in, her voice dropping low.
“Once we’re inside, follow my lead. Don’t screw this up.”noveldrama
Her fingers brushed lightly against Nathan’s sleeve, and for a moment, his heart skipped a beat. But her warning quickly snapped him back to his senses.
He nodded and gave her a subtle “OK” sign.
Noah stepped out of the car with calm, deliberate movements.
He watched them—arms linked, sharing a quiet laugh—as they headed toward the manor’s entrance.
Behind his composed expression, something dark stirred. His eyes locked on the pair, sharp with silent rage. The air around him turned cold, like the wind before a storm.
He should have done more last night. Letting Nathan walk away had been a mistake. He should have shattered both of his knees.
 ? ? ?．
He shot a glare toward Jack, who was following behind, every step marked with unease.
Jack stiffened under the weight of that stare. A chill crept up his spine, and he quickly lowered his head.
He ventured cautiously, measuring each word.
“Boss, want me to grab Nathan later? Maybe rough him up again?”
A muscle twitched in Noah’s temple. He spun to face him and growled,
“Did you not see the way she looked at me?”
Another beating would only make Sadie turn against him.
His breathing grew heavy. He tugged at his tie, jaw clenched tight. But after a pause, he swallowed the fury and followed them into the house.
In the living room, the Higgins elders sat upright, their expressions severe. Jarrett sat one step below them, his face unreadable, fingers tapping steadily against the armrest.
Sadie still had her arm looped through Nathan’s. Her smile was warm, steady, and practiced.
.
.
.
###Chapter 873:
“Good morning, gentlemen. I’m Sadie Hudson, Nathan’s fiancée. I apologize for the sudden visit.”
Sadie stood with poise, her expression calm yet impossible to ignore.
Tension coiled in the air, creeping through the room like a quiet storm. Across the space, the elders of the Higgins family shifted in their seats, their faces marked by disbelief and unease.
This was Sadie Hudson—the woman currently at the helm of Wall Group. It was a rare honor for these elders to even catch a glimpse of her. And now, here she was, addressing them as Nathan’s fiancée?
That single declaration sent a jolt through the room, a chill that crawled down every spine.
Rodger Higgins, father of both Jarrett and Nathan, had the most animated reaction of all.noveldrama
Had Sadie truly fallen for his underperforming second son? Was she really planning to marry Nathan? What astonishing fortune that would be. Rodger’s mind spun with possibilities, nerves giving way to a hopeful grin as he tried to break the ice.
“Ms. Hudson, you flatter us. For Nathan to have gained your favor—it’s beyond anything we could have imagined. Truly, we are honored.”
Ambition flickered behind his eyes. If an alliance with Wall Group became reality, the Higgins family’s future would be secure, unshakable.
Before silence could return, an elder with silver hair seized the moment.
“Rodger is absolutely right!” he exclaimed, nodding eagerly. “Nathan may be young, but he’s dependable. Ms. Hudson, you and he… you’re a perfect match!”
Another elder leaned forward, eager to contribute.
g?ν. – ?   
“Truly! Ms. Hudson, you’re exceptional—young, capable, unmatched across all of Beversea. Nathan marrying you would be the fortune of a lifetime!”
Compliments swirled through the room like incense—thick and unrelenting.
Next to Sadie, Nathan remained stiff, listening as the very elders who had once mocked him now tripped over themselves to sing his praises. His cheeks flushed red with a mix of discomfort and disbelief.
He risked a glance at Sadie.
There she stood—still, serene, her lips curved in a graceful smile, seemingly untouched by the noise around her.
She absorbed the flattery like one might listen to background music—present, but irrelevant.
She understood exactly how to charm these old schemers. Once they finished their little display, the real conversation—the one that actually mattered—would begin.
Rodger, sensing the warmth of the moment, smiled broadly and said,
.
.
.
###Chapter 874:
“Ms. Hudson, Nathan, don’t keep standing—please, have a seat. Let’s talk properly.”
He gestured toward the guest chairs.
But Sadie didn’t even glance at him. Her attention had already shifted to the seat that truly mattered—the one beside Rodger, the highest seat of authority in the Higgins family.
A flicker of amusement crossed her face. She linked her arm through Nathan’s and led him forward, past the offered seats, directly to the one at the center. Without hesitation, she sat down.
Nathan, guided by her, had no choice but to follow. He sat stiffly, the chair beneath him feeling like it was lined with needles and thorns.
Silence settled over the room like a thick fog. Every eye locked onto Sadie. Everyone was stunned.
Was that seat truly something that could be taken so casually? Even Jarrett, the acting chairman of the Higgins Group, sat below that rank. And yet, Sadie—Nathan’s fiancée—had taken the highest place without a second thought.noveldrama
Her boldness was astonishing. It was as if she had discarded the Higgins family’s long-standing traditions entirely.
The elders exchanged glances, clearly itching to rebuke her, but none dared to speak out. The weight of Wall Group’s influence pressed heavily on their tongues. Their resentment simmered in silence.
From his chair, Jarrett narrowed his gaze, silently reassessing Sadie.
She wasn’t someone to underestimate.
Meanwhile, Rodger sat motionless. He parted his lips, as if to speak, but no words came.
g?ν.0′ ?  
Sadie calmly scanned the room, her expression unreadable.
With a slow blink and the faintest tilt of her head, she asked in a voice laced with feigned innocence,
“Is something wrong? Why is everyone staring at me? Did I do something I shouldn’t have?”
The delivery was sweet, almost childlike, but her message was unmistakably clear. Not a single elder dared respond. Each one knew better than to challenge the woman who led Wall Group.
It was Jarrett who eventually broke the silence. His voice was calm, but there was an unmistakable chill beneath its surface.
“We certainly welcome your first visit. However, according to Higgins family tradition, a new bride is expected to respect our customs. Taking a seat equal to my father’s… that’s a bit improper.”
He didn’t accuse her directly. His tone remained composed, subtly emphasizing her breach of etiquette.
.
.
.
###Chapter 875:
Beneath that civility, however, Jarrett’s resentment burned. Did Sadie really believe that being engaged to Nathan gave her the right to assert dominance here? How naive.
Before the echo of his last word faded, a smooth voice cut clean through the tension at the doorway.
“Mr. Higgins makes a valid point.”
All heads turned sharply toward the source of the interruption.
A tall figure strode into the room with quiet command, his face partially concealed behind a cool, silver mask.
Everyone recognized him instantly—Patrick Noel, CEO of the Burgess Group.
His gaze swept deliberately across the room, pausing on no one in particular, yet missing nothing.
“However,” he continued, “from what I understand, Ms. Hudson and Mr. Nathan Higgins have only just made their engagement public. There’s been no formal engagement ceremony, let alone a wedding. Don’t you think it’s a little premature to call her a new bride, Mr. Higgins? Or has time begun to cloud your judgment?”noveldrama
His voice wasn’t loud, but each word struck with unshakable precision.
Rodger froze for a brief moment, then quickly rose to his feet, smoothing a polite smile onto his face as he moved forward to greet Noah.
The night before, Patrick’s assistant, Jack, had contacted Rodger with astonishing news: the Burgess Group was expressing serious interest in a strategic partnership with the Higgins Group. Even more impressive—Patrick himself would be arriving today to discuss the collaboration in person.
To Rodger, this was nothing short of monumental.
Discover where it all happens: g?lnσν?s?c?m
Just three years ago, the Burgess Group had been a modest name in the business world. Now, it was a rising powerhouse, rapidly gaining international clout and standing nearly toe-to-toe with the Wall Group.
If the Higgins family could align themselves with such a formidable force, their influence would skyrocket overnight.
Rodger was practically beaming. His excitement bubbled over as he approached Noah with an enthusiastic smile, hand extended in greeting.
“Mr. Noel, it’s an honor to have you here!”
But Noah didn’t so much as glance in his direction. Without breaking stride, he brushed past Rodger entirely, leaving the outstretched hand suspended in awkward air.
The room fell into stunned silence at the cold dismissal.
Noah walked with purpose to the seat Rodger had just vacated—the one directly beside Sadie—and sat down.
With a fluid, almost regal motion, he adjusted the cuff of his sleeve. It was effortless, as if the seat beside Sadie had always belonged to him.
.
.
.
###Chapter 876:
The room was stunned into further disbelief. No one understood what they were witnessing.
Even Sadie hadn’t expected such a bold and deliberate move. Her brows drew together slightly as she turned to look at Noah.
Their eyes met. And in that fleeting moment, something unspoken passed between them—a spark, sharp and undeniable.
Every gaze in the room slowly shifted to the pair seated side by side.
Was it just their imagination? The man, composed and enigmatic, cloaked in quiet power. The woman, poised and radiant, carrying an air of untouchable elegance. Together, they formed a striking tableau—an unlikely, yet hauntingly perfect harmony.
Meanwhile, Nathan sat awkwardly on the other side of Sadie, his swollen face doing little to hide just how out of place he felt.
The unspoken truth hung heavily in the air—Nathan’s presence now felt completely irrelevant. And that realization only made the situation more surreal.
Rodger remained frozen, his forced smile still plastered across his face, hand suspended mid-air like a forgotten prop. His mind raced to make sense of what he was seeing.
What was happening? The dynamic between Patrick and Sadie was far too intimate. What did this mean for his son Nathan? Was there more to the engagement than anyone had assumed?
Around the room, the elders exchanged uneasy glances, their expressions guarded, none daring to speak. The atmosphere had grown thick with uncertainty.noveldrama
Then Sadie laughed—soft, deliberate, and disarming.
 : gν﹒
“Nathan and I are very much in love, even if we’re not married yet. And about where we’re seated…”
She paused, her gaze drifting across the elders, her eyes sharp beneath her composed exterior.
“I assumed it was arranged according to status. But if any of you gentlemen find it inappropriate, I’d be more than willing to move.”
Though her tone was polite, her words cut like glass.
With a single remark, she reaffirmed her relationship with Nathan while placing the weight of the seating decision squarely on the Higgins family.
Rodger’s smile faltered. A twitch of discomfort pulled at the corner of his mouth.
Sadie—young as she was—spoke with a poise and authority that left no room for rebuke.
After all, she was the chairwoman of the Wall Group. And with Patrick seated calmly beside her, exuding quiet dominance, Rodger knew better than to challenge her position.
Quickly, he composed himself, forcing his smile wider, his voice now laced with a touch of deference.
.
.
.
###Chapter 877:
“No, no—please, Ms. Hudson, there’s no need for that. The seating arrangement is completely appropriate.”
As he spoke, he subtly dabbed at the cold sweat forming on his forehead, then eased himself into a nearby seat with as much composure as he could muster.
Nathan, still visibly bruised, straightened in his chair.
Despite the swelling, a flicker of pride lit his features.noveldrama
For once, someone was standing up for him—publicly and powerfully. And not just anyone. It was Sadie. In that moment, she wasn’t just his fiancée. She was his shield.
Across the room, Jarrett’s expression darkened. He sat rigid in his wheelchair, eyes narrowed, fury etched into every line of his face.
His hand gripped the armrest so tightly that his knuckles turned white. Sadie Hudson was no mere ornament—she was a force. And her unexpected closeness to Patrick raised more questions than answers.
Still, Sadie paid no mind to the stares or the silent speculations circling around her. Her voice remained steady, her posture poised, as she addressed the room.
“Since I’ve made the decision to marry Nathan, it’s only natural that the Wall and Higgins families will soon be connected. From this point forward, we’ll be family.”
She let the words settle, the weight of them deliberate. Then, with seamless precision, she continued:
“The Wall Group is currently developing several key projects. I’ve reviewed them personally and believe they align perfectly with the Higgins Group’s capabilities.”
Her gaze drifted to Nathan—measured, calm, deliberate.
“I had every intention of entrusting these projects to the Higgins Group. But…”
Unforgettable stories on g?lnσν?so
Her voice dipped slightly, laced with subtle warning.
“I’ve recently learned that my fiancé, Nathan, doesn’t hold any substantial position within his family’s company. If that’s truly the case, I may need to reconsider—perhaps find a partner better positioned to execute these projects effectively.”
Rodger’s eyes widened, stunned. Projects from the Wall Group? And not just one—several?
Everyone in Beversea knew the magnitude of such an offer. The Wall Group wasn’t just powerful—it was a corporate giant. Even a fraction of their projects could sustain smaller companies for years.
For the Higgins Group, this partnership could redefine their future.
But there was a catch.
Nathan—his younger, more impulsive son—would need to assume a significant role in the company. And what about Jarrett? Jarrett had always been the heir in Rodger’s eyes. The one groomed for leadership. The current chairman. The obedient son who followed every rule.
A storm swirled behind Rodger’s eyes as he struggled to maintain composure. His smile faltered, tightening at the corners.
.
.
.
###Chapter 878:
“Ms. Hudson, you see…” he began carefully, weighing each word. “Nathan has always preferred a more… independent lifestyle. He’s not exactly accustomed to the demands of corporate leadership.”
Rodger paused, then hastily added,
“But his older brother, Jarrett, is immensely capable—experienced. He’s already serving as chairman of the Higgins Group. Why not allow him to oversee these projects? I’m confident Jarrett would manage them flawlessly.”noveldrama
Rodger’s intentions couldn’t have been more transparent. He was clearly maneuvering to sideline Nathan and channel the benefits toward his favored son, Jarrett.
But if he expected Sadie to play along, he had miscalculated. She remained poised, her expression unreadable, the faint curve of her lips more formality than warmth.
“Oh?” Her voice was calm, almost amused. “You’re suggesting Jarrett take the lead on these projects?” She nodded slightly, as if thoughtfully considering the proposal. “That’s certainly one option.”
Then her tone shifted. A quiet edge slipped beneath her politeness as her gaze settled on Jarrett, who sat silently in his wheelchair, his eyes dark and unreadable. “However… if that’s the case, perhaps Jarrett would be open to marrying my cousin-in-law, Briley Wall? Given how closely our companies would be working together, a marriage alliance could only help solidify trust and streamline cooperation. Wouldn’t you agree?”
She paused just long enough to let the suggestion hang in the air, but not long enough for anyone to interrupt.
“Of course,” she continued, “I’m aware that Jarrett is already engaged to Miss Ophelia Johnson, and the wedding is scheduled for the end of this month. I realize this might seem like an unreasonable proposal, but unfortunately, it’s a long-standing tradition at Wall Group. Marriage is required for high-level cooperative ventures of this nature.” She folded her hands neatly in her lap. “So, here are the options: either my fiancé, Nathan, oversees the projects, or Jarrett marries Briley, and we proceed from there.” She tilted her head slightly toward Jarrett. “Two choices. Take your time.”
L?t?st ?hαpt?rs in glnovl.o
Nathan, seated quietly beside her, couldn’t help but be impressed. So, this was her strategy. Remarkable.
Who was Briley? Everyone in Beversea knew her name, and not for flattering reasons. A string of public scandals had followed her brief stint in the entertainment industry.
She was infamous, unpredictable, and officially excluded from the Wall Group’s core structure—by public statement, no less.
Rodger, a man obsessed with reputation, would never accept her as a daughter-in-law.
Even if Rodger did agree—driven by desperation—it would destroy Jarrett’s engagement to Ophelia and crush the alliance with the Johnson family. It was checkmate, no matter how one looked at it.
Sadie’s move was masterful—subtle enough to appear diplomatic, but aimed straight at the heart of the Higgins family’s power dynamic.

###Chapter 879:noveldrama
Nathan’s admiration deepened. She wasn’t just clever—she was lethal when she needed to be.
Rodger’s face darkened noticeably. For a moment, he said nothing. Then he reached for his coffee cup and took a slow sip, coughing lightly to buy himself time and soften the rising tension.
“Ms. Hudson,” he said carefully, his voice low and measured, “you must understand… Nathan is too young. He shows promise, of course, but he doesn’t yet have the experience to take on such an important role.” He was still trying to hold the line. This was his last stand.
Sadie said nothing, her eyes fixed steadily on Rodger, silently watching to see what move he would make next.
Rodger’s gaze darted around the room. He was clearly searching for a solution. Then, clearing his throat, he finally said, “How about this, Ms. Hudson? Our company currently has a vacancy in the general manager role. Perhaps Nathan could join the Higgins Group and take on that position—get some practical experience under his belt. As for the cooperation with the Wall Group, we can revisit the discussion once he’s settled into the role. Would that be acceptable to you?”
It was a retreat, a calculated one. Offering Nathan the general manager post was Rodger’s way of throwing Sadie a bone—a visible sign of compromise. In his mind, it was fair.
Nathan was family, after all. Giving him a position with a respectable title seemed like a reasonable gesture. But Sadie’s expression didn’t shift.
Just as Rodger began to hope she might agree, a low chuckle broke the silence. It was Noah. He had been silent until now—watching from the sidelines.
Sadie’s brows drew together, a flicker of annoyance passing through her eyes as she turned to him. What was he doing? Was he trying to sabotage her leverage?
Lαττ ?нαρτ?rs ιn glov?l.om
Her eyes flicked toward him, a silent warning telling him not to interfere.
But Noah either didn’t see it, or simply didn’t care.
“Don’t you think your terms lean a bit too heavily in your favor, Ms. Hudson?” His tone was calm—too calm—lacking even a hint of emotion. “After all, with the two families on the verge of merging, any true collaboration should be built on sincerity,” Noah said smoothly. “Proposing that Nathan take the lead while sidelining Jarrett feels… a bit inappropriate, don’t you think?”
To anyone listening, it sounded as though Noah was defending the Higgins family’s internal balance—perhaps even advocating for Jarrett.
Sadie blinked, momentarily thrown. What was he up to now?
Across the room, Rodger and Jarrett exchanged startled looks, clearly baffled by Noah’s words.
But Noah didn’t bother to acknowledge their confusion. He simply continued, as if laying out the most reasonable suggestion in the world. “In my view, why not let Nathan and Jarrett co-manage the projects? They’re both heirs of the Higgins family—equal in name and legacy. Wouldn’t it be more appropriate if they shared the position of chairman?” The silence that followed was instant and heavy.
.
.
.
###Chapter 880:
Two chairmen? Shock rippled through the room. The very idea defied traditional structure.
Sadie stared at Noah, genuinely stunned.
Rodger fell into silent contemplation upon hearing Noah’s proposal. At first, the idea had seemed absurd—but the more he considered it, the more appealing it became.
Jarrett had a long-standing presence within the company. His experience, reputation, and internal support made him a pillar of the Higgins Group. Installing Nathan as co-chairman wouldn’t truly threaten that foundation. With Nathan holding a title, Sadie would be placated, and the Wall Group’s cooperation secured.
Meanwhile, the real control would remain in Jarrett’s hands. Better yet, Jarrett’s involvement with Wall Group projects would only further solidify his standing.
The deeper Rodger thought, the more advantageous the arrangement appeared. He turned toward Jarrett, and the two exchanged a subtle glance—wordless but full of mutual understanding.
Then, with renewed warmth, Rodger faced Sadie once more. His smile had returned, smoother and brighter than ever.
“Ms. Hudson, I must say—Mr. Noel’s proposal is truly a wise one. Let’s proceed with his suggestion. Nathan and Jarrett will jointly serve as chairmen of the Higgins Group.”
“Group. As for the collaboration with the Wall Group, rest assured—we’ll commit every resource necessary to meet your expectations.” The shift in Rodger’s tone was almost startling.noveldrama
Moments ago, he had been cautious and resistant. Now he was enthusiastic, practically eager for Sadie’s approval.
Sadie’s lips curled faintly—not in amusement, but in quiet contempt. Rodger was a businessman to the core: opportunistic and transparent. The moment profit was within reach, his entire demeanor changed in the blink of an eye. Still, she had gotten what she came for. There was nothing left to to. But even as she accepted the outcome, her mind lingered elsewhere—on Noah. What game was he playing?
   at ν﹒
The butler glided forward with practiced poise.
“Mr. Higgins, ladies and gentlemen, lunch is served,” he announced with quiet authority.
Everyone rose in unison and walked toward the dining room, where a round table gleamed with an array of exquisite dishes.
Rodger beamed as he strode forward, his enthusiasm impossible to contain.
“Ms. Hudson, please take the seat of honor.” He gestured with a flourish. Two ornate armchairs commanded attention side by side at the head of the table.
Sadie settled into her designated chair, accepting Rodger’s direction. Nathan approached with barely concealed satisfaction, poised to claim the prestigious spot beside her.
Without warning, a shadow slipped between them.

Message from Noah: Good night dear readers. God loves you and Noah whishes you all the best. ( ? ? – ) ?

###Chapter 881:
Noah smoothly claimed the coveted seat next to Sadie, his movements fluid yet deliberate.
Nathan’s movement froze mid-air, and his smile stiffened.
Confusion washed over his features as he hovered awkwardly.
A palpable tension descended upon the gathering, suspended in uncomfortable quiet.
Rodger recognized the brewing storm and swiftly intervened to defuse the situation.
He shot Nathan a withering look that could have scorched stone.
This idiot! Rodger fumed inwardly.
“Nathan,” he said, pointing to a far-off chair, “you should sit there. Mr. Noel is also an honored guest and belongs here.”
Nathan’s indignation flared behind his eyes, yet he swallowed any protest that threatened to escape.
He forced a smile and absently rubbed his nose, a nervous habit betraying his discomfort.
With reluctant compliance, he trudged to the distant end of the table and sank into his assigned seat.
What rotten luck, he brooded. Why did this damned Patrick constantly materialize at every turn?
Noah, meanwhile, appeared utterly oblivious to the little drama. His gaze drifted across the lavish spread, eventually settling on a platter of succulent steak. With surprising familiarity, he speared a choice cut of steak and transferred it to Sadie’s plate in one fluid motion.
Sadie froze, momentarily startled by the gesture. She lifted her gaze to study Noah’s face, bewilderment evident in her expression. What exactly was he playing at? she wondered.
  ? ? ?ν
From his wheelchair, Jarrett scrutinized the exchange with calculating intensity. His fingers tightened around his cup, betraying his inner tension. Patrick exhibited a peculiar familiarity with Sadie that defied casual acquaintance. Was there some hidden connection between them that everyone else had missed?noveldrama
Noah detected Sadie’s hesitation, her untouched silverware and transfixed stare at the plate before her. His brow furrowed with concern.
“What’s wrong?” he murmured.
His voice carried the gentle undercurrent of genuine worry. “Is it not to your taste?” he asked, leaning closer.
Sadie stared down at the perfectly cooked steak glistening on her plate. The savory aroma that should have tantalized her senses instead triggered something else entirely.
Without warning, a violent wave of nausea crashed through her body. Her stomach revolted, twisting and clenching against her will.
.

.
###Chapter 882:
Color drained from her face as beads of cold sweat materialized across her forehead. Despite her valiant attempt to master the discomfort, her complexion betrayed her distress.
“Sorry, I need to step out for a moment,” she managed to whisper.
Unable to contain herself another second, she bolted upright, one hand clamped over her mouth, and fled toward the bathroom.
A stunned silence descended upon the dining room, heavy and immediate. Bewildered glances ricocheted around the table as guests sought answers in each other’s expressions. Not a soul could fathom what had just transpired.
Confusion etched itself across Rodger’s features. Suspiciously, he picked up a morsel of steak with his fork and brought it cautiously to his lips. The flavor burst across his palate—perfectly seasoned, expertly prepared, utterly flawless.
What in heaven’s name could have caused that reaction from Sadie? His perplexed gaze oscillated between Sadie’s hasty exit and Nathan’s bewildered face.
A startling possibility crashed into his consciousness. Could Sadie be pregnant?
He shot Nathan a loaded glance brimming with unspoken implications. In one swift motion, his foot connected sharply with Nathan’s shin beneath the tablecloth.
“What are you gawking at?” he hissed. “Go check on Ms. Hudson immediately!”
Nathan, contentedly devouring his meal, remained blissfully oblivious to what had just happened. Rodger’s unexpected kick jolted him from his culinary reverie. He dropped his fork with a clatter, his cheeks still bulging with food.
“Huh? Oh—right! I’ll check on her!” he said through his mouthful.
Scrambling to his feet, he hurried after Sadie’s retreating form.

Rodger pivoted toward Noah, noting the displeasure etched across his features, and hastily assumed an expression of contrition.
“Mr. Noel, please accept my apologies,” he offered smoothly. “Ms. Hudson appears indisposed. Please, let’s continue our meal—I trust this won’t dampen your enjoyment.”
Noah deliberately set down his silverware, his mask concealing whatever emotions might have flickered across his face. He locked eyes with Jarrett across the expanse of the table, then rose silently and strode from the room without explanation. Jarrett caught the unspoken message instantly.
With practiced ease, he maneuvered his wheelchair away from the table and followed in Noah’s wake.
Rodger stared after their departing figures, his bewilderment multiplying exponentially. What peculiar game was unfolding before him? Everyone seemed to be dancing to some secret melody only they could hear. He dismissed the matter with a weary shake of his head, unwilling to untangle the mystery. The labyrinthine affairs of youth exceeded what his aging mind cared to decipher.
Composing his features into a genial expression, he turned his attention to the elders.
.
.
.noveldrama
###Chapter 883:
“Let’s resume our meal,” he suggested warmly. “The dramas of youth needn’t concern us.”
Tranquility gradually reclaimed the dining room. The elders, grateful for the return to normalcy, retrieved their silverware in unison.
“Yes, Mr. Higgins is right. Let’s continue.”
“The cuisine is truly exceptional,” another commented appreciatively.
Murmurs of agreement rippled around the table as the meal resumed its pleasant rhythm.
Meanwhile, Noah and Jarrett entered the verdant sanctuary of the manor’s garden. Jarrett stopped his wheelchair and turned around. He tilted his head to meet the gaze of the masked figure towering before him.
“I’m indebted to you, Mr. Noel, for your timely intervention earlier,” he said.
Had Noah not proposed the dual chairmanship, Sadie might have compelled him to surrender company leadership to Nathan—that worthless excuse for a businessman. The shared title sounded preposterous on paper, yet Jarrett harbored absolute certainty that Nathan’s chairmanship posed no genuine threat to his authority. Better still, Jarrett preserved his standing while securing legitimate involvement in Wall Group’s ventures. The arrangement proved masterfully advantageous.noveldrama
Noah slipped his hands into his pockets with practiced nonchalance, his lips curving in a subtle smile.
“Mr. Higgins,” he drawled, “such formality is unnecessary. We are now allies.” He cocked his head, his gaze drifting toward the stately manor looming in the distance.
“I’m curious about your strategy moving forward,” he mused. “I might provide valuable counsel, particularly since Ms. Hudson appears quite enchanted by your brother. Nathan projects frivolity, but he may prove a more formidable opponent than anticipated.”
Every tale finds a home at g?lnσνs?com
The words held a deeper significance.
Jarrett sneered inwardly. He was uncertain about Nathan, but Patrick, standing before him, was definitely a challenge. And Jarrett could feel the complexity of Sadie and Patrick’s relationship. His gaze grew slightly darker.
However, for the moment, their common enemies were Nathan and Sadie. It seemed harmless to collaborate temporarily with Patrick.
“Of course, Mr. Noel, since it interests you, I’ll share the details.” He briefly outlined his plans.
Noah listened in silence, a faint smile playing at the corners of his mouth beneath his mask.
Perfect. If Jarrett remained consistent, everything else would align.
What about Sadie? The memory of her pale face as she fled haunted him, darkening his gaze.

###Chapter 884:
Meanwhile, in the restroom, Sadie clutched the icy rim of the sink. A violent episode of vomiting had left her feeling hollow, with a persistent sour taste. She turned the faucet, gathered some water, and splashed it on her face to refresh herself.
Footsteps echoed behind her. Nathan entered cautiously, his face still marked by redness and swelling. He handed her a tissue gently.
“Ms. Hudson, are you all right? You seem uncomfortable.”
Accepting the tissue, Sadie wiped her mouth. She nodded her head, her voice feeble. “I’m fine.” She had been feeling off lately. Fatigue was constant, her appetite was lacking, and the mere sight of meat or oily foods made her stomach churn with nausea.
This sensation…
Nathan watched her, his face etched with concern.
Then, as if a thought had suddenly occurred to him, his eyes lit up. With a tentative and speculative tone, he said, “Ms. Hudson, you—you aren’t expecting, are you?”
His words struck Sadie forcefully. She snapped her head up, disbelief widening her eyes. Impossible! Instinctively, her hand went to her flat stomach. No feeling there.noveldrama
Yet her mind raced as she recalled recent events. The tiredness, the revulsion at meat, and the sudden nausea just now. These symptoms were strikingly similar to what she had experienced during her previous pregnancy with Averi.
No, it couldn’t be!
Nathan saw Sadie lost in thought, and his heart raced. Panic welled up within him. Damn it! Had he unwittingly blurted out the truth?
Sadie Hudson, chairwoman of Wall Group, a widow, was pregnant? Should this news leak, it would spark a scandal of enormous proportions. Was he, a minor player in this drama, now privy to a dark secret among the elite? In TV dramas, characters like him who knew too much often met early ends at the hands of the protagonists! Could he be at risk for knowing too much?

The more he pondered, the more his fear grew. Acting on instinct, he covered his mouth with his hands, eyes wide with fear.
Sadie collected herself. She dropped her hand, her face returning to its usual poise.
“Stop saying nonsense.” She glanced briefly at Nathan. “It’s likely just exhaustion and some gastritis. I’m not feeling well. I need to rest back at the hotel.”
Nathan nodded eagerly, his hands still over his mouth as he murmured, “Of course! I’ll drive you.” As long as it kept him safe, he was ready to comply with her wishes.
Sadie did not . Feeling utterly spent, she just wanted a quiet place to rest.
They didn’t go back to the dining room; instead, they quietly exited through the side door of the manor.
Nathan’s conspicuous pink sports car was parked nearby. He hurried ahead and opened the passenger door for Sadie.
As Sadie approached the car to get in, a tall figure appeared beside it without warning. It was Noah. Unnoticed, he had followed them out, now standing there with an unreadable expression.
.
.
.
###Chapter 885:
Nathan’s heart skipped a beat, and his body tensed. He instinctively stepped back. His movements were so smooth they seemed automatic. Nathan sighed. It looked like he was doomed to be the chauffeur for these two today.
Noah’s eyes lifted, his icy stare sweeping over Nathan, carrying a clear threat.
“Drive.”
Nathan dared not . He nodded and bowed repeatedly.
“Absolutely, Mr. Noel!”
Noah tore his eyes away from Nathan and fixed them on Sadie, whose face was still considerably pale. He reached out and grasped her wrist without a word. With a slight tug, he pulled her away from the passenger seat, opened the back door, and practically ushered her inside before getting in himself.
His movements were quick and smooth, his demeanor commanding and resolute. Sadie was caught in a daze. By the time she realized what had happened, she was already sitting next to an intimidating Noah.noveldrama
In the driver’s seat, Nathan glanced at them through the rearview mirror. He let out a resigned sigh, then started the car. The air inside the car was heavy with tension.
Sadie shifted in her seat, trying to put more distance between herself and Noah. Just what in the world was he up to, anyway? He had lost his memory and chosen Hailey. Why did he keep meddling in her life? What kind of game was he playing?
Sadie gritted her teeth and swallowed her irritation before turning to Noah. “Mr. Noel, what exactly are you trying to do here?”
Noah ignored her question and fixed his eyes on Nathan through the rearview mirror. The poor man was still visibly shaken.
“Mr. Higgins,” Noah suddenly said. “Do you know who among the Higgins Group employees are loyal subordinates of Jarrett?”
Endless adventures await on gα?ησν?s?com
Nathan immediately abandoned any pretense of nonchalance. His back went ramrod straight, and his expression turned grave. Even his grip on the steering wheel tightened. Patrick was clearly no ordinary person. He got straight to the point.
Nathan subconsciously glanced at the rearview mirror again. He saw that Sadie was still looking pale, but her eyes had regained their usual clarity. She met his eyes and gave him a small nod.
Only then did Nathan address Noah’s question. “I do. More than half of the shareholders are loyal to Jarrett, not to mention the managers of the finance, marketing, human resources, and public relations departments. They are all his trusted aides. These people are deeply tied to Jarrett’s interests. Pigs would have to fly before anyone could convince them to turn against him.” His tone was a little strained. This particular fact was the main reason why Nathan could never gather enough power and resources to rise against Jarrett throughout the years.
Jarrett’s hold within the company ran far too deep and stretched far too wide.
Beneath his mask, Noah’s lips curled into a faint smile. “Good.” This was just what he wanted. The more tangled the web was, the easier it would be to eliminate all at once.
.
.
.
###Chapter 886:
“Do you have any evidence of their private dealings with Jarrett?”
Nathan hesitated at the question. He had indeed collected some proof in secret, but he had never dared to bring it to light. The timing was never right, and he always feared that stirring the pot would backfire on him, badly.
Nathan contemplated for a moment before replying, “If you investigate thoroughly, you’re bound to find something.”
At that point, Sadie could no longer hold back.
“Mr. Noel, I’m asking you again, what are you trying to do? What are you implying? You spoke up on Jarrett’s behalf back at the manor and allowed him to get involved in Wall Group’s projects. What are you really up to?”noveldrama
She had tried and failed to fathom Noah’s intentions. He had always been such an enigma, and it pissed her off.
Noah turned to meet her gaze. “If Nathan here is planning to take over the Higgins Group, then the Wall Group’s projects would provide the best opportunity for him to take action.” He paused briefly to glance at Nathan in the rearview mirror. “Jarrett may have a lot of allies within the company, but that also means there is a veritable mix of good and bad apples among them. There is no guarantee that the projects will be executed smoothly and without mistakes. A failure in one operation can lead to a chain reaction, and when that happens, who will take responsibility? Naturally, Jarrett will be the one to take the fall.”
Sadie finally understood. So, this was Noah’s plan.
He was using the Wall Group’s projects as bait to lure Jarrett and his loyal allies into a trap, planning to close in on them during the course of the projects’ operations. Events would inevitably unfold that would lead to Jarrett’s removal from the position of chairman.
It was a ruthless scheme, but also an effective one. Regardless of the power and influence Jarrett held, they would mean nothing if he was caught in a massive business blunder. And with Sadie and the Wall Group applying pressure from both sides, Rodger wouldn’t dare to act recklessly, no matter how much he wanted to prevent Jarrett’s downfall.

Noah was very cunning—terrifyingly so. He seemed to have read her thoughts as well, because he continued in a voice tinged with amusement.
“Moreover, Mr. Higgins, Jarrett is no doubt eager to find an opportunity to give you a hard time, what with you being the newly appointed chairman and all. Instead of waiting for him to make a move, why not open a link in the chain and show him some semblance of weakness first? After all, pretending…”
Noah threw a pointed glance at the driver’s seat. “It’s your specialty, isn’t it, Mr. Higgins?”
Nathan raised an eyebrow at the remark. It looked like Noah had seen right through him. He decided to drop the act altogether.
“I suppose that won’t be a problem,” Nathan replied casually. He was quite experienced in playing the fool to catch others off-guard.
.
.
.
###Chapter 887:
Noah snapped back to reality, looking at Sadie’s thoughtful profile. Suddenly, he reached out and gently ruffled her hair.
“Sadie, Sadie. How did you become so obtuse all of a sudden?”
It was such a simple plan, yet she hadn’t figured it out early on. Sadie stiffened, more from his touch than his words. She quickly swatted his hand away.
“Don’t touch me!” she snapped, her eyes flashing with cold defiance. How dare he act so familiar with her? Who did he think he was?
Nathan kept his eyes on the road and pretended not to notice anything. He didn’t even dare to breathe too loudly. He could sense the tension between the other two, and he knew it wasn’t something he could get involved in. He didn’t have the fortitude. His life would be far easier if he kept to his lane and kept his thoughts to himself.
The rest of the drive was spent in silence.
Before long, the pink sports car pulled up in front of the Emerald Hotel. No sooner did it come to a stop than Sadie flung the car door open and jumped out without a backward glance.
She slammed the door behind her with so much force that Nathan couldn’t help but wince. He proceeded to inwardly lament the abuse of his limited edition sports car.
As he was doing this, Noah leisurely got out of the car. Before leaving, however, he pulled a crisp hundred-dollar bill from his pocket and tossed it through the driver’s seat window.
“Cab fare,” he quipped before straightening and sauntering into the hotel.
Nathan stared after him, dumbfounded. Cab fare? How humiliating! Patrick had really just treated him—a member of the Higgins family—like a chauffeur.
Nathan’s embarrassment soon morphed into anger. He did nothing about it, though, and simply stepped on the gas. In the end, he knew that neither Sadie nor Patrick was to be trifled with. His best bet was to make a swift exit.
gα?ησν?sоm, your fiction hub
Nathan sped all the way back to his villa in the suburbs. He had just stepped out of his car when a petite figure darted out from the flower bushes nearby. A whiff of fragrance trailed after her, and the next thing Nathan knew, she was clinging onto his waist.
He stiffened, his brows knitting into a deep frown. Who would have the audacity to pounce on him like this?noveldrama
He pulled back slightly and looked down, only to find a tearful Ophelia.
Nathan clicked his tongue and resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Instead, he patted her back and put some more distance between them.
“Miss Johnson,” he said, his tone laced with subtle mockery, “you are about to be my sister-in-law. Throwing yourself at me like this isn’t appropriate behavior, is it?”
Ophelia wept even harder. She gazed up at him, her eyes red and puffy and full of grievance.
“Nathan!” she cried out. “Tell me the truth! Your engagement to that woman, Sadie, is fake, right? It must be some ruse to provoke Daren and annoy Jarrett, right? It must be! We… We’ve already had sex. You can’t just cast me aside!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 888:
Nathan’s expression turned cold, and every trace of nonchalance vanished from his face.
Ophelia was truly a foolish girl. Did she actually believe he had genuine feelings for her?
He forcibly pushed her away until they were no longer touching.
“I think you’ve misunderstood something. I never forced you to have sex with me. I’ll admit, part of the reason I got involved with you was to get under Jarrett’s skin, but now…”
He paused and looked Ophelia up and down with a sneer. “Now that I’ve achieved my goal, you no longer hold any value for me. We were two consenting adults who had a bit of fun. You would do well not to take such things to heart.”
He suddenly took a step forward, his voice turning an octave deeper as he added, “If you make the mistake of clinging onto me again, there will be consequences.”
With that, Nathan walked past Ophelia and headed into the villa without waiting for her response.
He found a servant standing in attendance at the foyer.
“Keep the door secure,” Nathan instructed in a chilly voice. “Don’t let any unwanted guests in to dirty my home.”
The door shut with a heavy thud behind him.
Ophelia was so startled by the noise that she jumped and trembled. She stood in place, her eyes dazed, even as tears streamed down her face.
How did things end up this way? Just a few days ago, she was tangled up with Nathan in bed, and he had been so gentle with her. How did he turn into someone so heartless now?
Was it because of Sadie? It must be her fault! That shameless woman must have used some trick to seduce Nathan. Ophelia was convinced of it.
g?ν.0.  
She slumped to the ground, her makeup ruined, her hair an utter mess. When she was finally able to gather herself somewhat, she stumbled away from Nathan’s villa. She wasn’t even sure how, but she managed to make it back home.
Daren was in the living room, reading the financial news while lounging on the sofa.
When he saw his sister walk in with swollen eyes and a tear-stained face, Daren scowled. He knew right away that she had snuck out to find Nathan again. Such a disappointment of a sibling.
Daren felt a surge of anger, but he couldn’t bring himself to unleash it on her. Instead, he put the newspaper down and tried to soften his tone. “What happened?”
Ophelia padded into the living room and sat across from him, acting as if she hadn’t heard a word he had said. She sat there for a long time, silent and dazed. Then her head suddenly jerked up, and she fixed her brother with a determined gaze.noveldrama
“Daren, I’m willing to marry Jarrett.”
Daren was about to take a sip of his coffee, but his hand paused midair. He eyed his sister in surprise, wondering if he had heard her correctly. She had been adamant about not marrying Jarrett, insisting that it was Nathan she loved. She had caused such a commotion, and now she was saying she wanted to marry Jarrett after all? What had happened?
.
.
.
###Chapter 889:
In any case, Daren was just relieved that Ophelia had finally come to her senses. This was good news for the Johnson family.
Although Jarrett was disabled, he was still very much capable and influential. More than anything else, he was still the head of the Higgins family. If Ophelia married him, the relationship between the two families would be more secure.
Daren sighed in relief and beamed at his sister. “It’s good to see that you’ve come around. I’m glad you are able to see some sense. Jarrett may have physical limitations, but he is a good person. He cares about you. He will never treat his wife poorly.”
The next morning, in the dining hall of the Emerald Hotel, Sadie sat by the window, a simple breakfast laid out before her. She held her fork in one hand while the other scrolled through the tablet beside her plate. The screen was filled with paragraphs of detailed information about various collaborative projects.
She was so engrossed in what she was reading that she didn’t immediately notice when someone joined her.
Noah pulled out the chair across from her and gracefully took his seat. It wasn’t until he picked up his cutlery that Sadie finally realized he was there.
She lifted her gaze and found Noah staring at her. A flicker of annoyance crossed her face. He was like a bad penny that kept turning up.
Sadie put her fork down and spoke in an aloof voice. “This dining hall is huge, Mr. Noel. Can’t you find yourself another table? I’m not interested in sharing, you see.”
Noah was unfazed by her not-so-subtle attempt to make him leave. He plucked the napkin from his lap and dabbed at the corners of his mouth, even though he hadn’t started eating yet. For some reason, he found that annoying Sadie was rather entertaining.
“Sorry,” he said with an innocent shrug. “I lost my wallet yesterday. I’m afraid I have no choice but to intrude upon you, Ms. Hudson.”
Sadie’s lips twitched. Only he could deliver such a flimsy excuse with a straight face. The esteemed president of the Burgess Group lost his wallet? What a joke. But she couldn’t be bothered to argue with him, let alone point out his fakery.
Sadie locked her tablet and made to rise from the table. If Noah wasn’t going to leave, then she was going to do it herself. But she hadn’t even gotten to her feet when Tina rushed over with a troubled expression.
“Sadie,” Tina called out, and Sadie noticed that a woman was trailing behind her.
This second woman was decked out in luxury brands, her makeup impeccable, but her eyes were blazing with unmistakable resentment. Sadie recalled seeing this woman at the banquet at Splendor Hotel—she and Daren had caught her having sex with Nathan in the second-floor lounge.noveldrama
Tina was just about to explain the situation, but Ophelia couldn’t wait. She stepped forward and scrutinized Sadie with an arrogant, hostile gaze. Her upper lip curled into a sneer.
“I thought you were some stunning beauty,” Ophelia said sarcastically. “It turns out you’re just an old woman. You’re not even much to look at.”
.

###Chapter 890:
Sadie paused before calmly leaning back in her seat to assess her uninvited visitor. Her eyes narrowed slightly.
Ophelia had come raring for a fight, that much was clear. It wasn’t hard to guess her reason, either. Ophelia had likely come after hearing about her and Nathan’s so-called engagement. It seemed that Ophelia had genuinely fallen for Nathan. Unfortunately for her, that rascal did not reciprocate her feelings.
“Miss Johnson,” Sadie said slowly, “what brings you here this early?”
Ophelia scoffed and rolled her eyes, irritated by Sadie’s composure. Then she pulled a gold-embossed invitation out of her purse and tossed it on the table in front of Sadie, as if she were doing her a favor.
Ophelia raised her chin, looking down her nose at Sadie as she said, “Jarrett and I are getting married the day after tomorrow. I’m hoping you will attend, Ms. Hudson. After all, we will soon be sisters-in-law. We’re going to be family, aren’t we?”
Sadie couldn’t help her own sneer. She cast a brief glance at the invitation, then looked up at Ophelia with a mocking gaze.
“Of course. I wouldn’t miss your wedding for the world, Miss Johnson.” Sadie paused for a few seconds and injected a hint of regret into her voice. “It’s such a pity that Jarrett is bound to a wheelchair. You’ll have to devote the rest of your life to taking care of him.”noveldrama
Her words fell like a bolt of lightning, striking right at the heart of Ophelia’s sore spot. Everyone was well aware of Jarrett’s disability.
Ophelia gritted her teeth, her nostrils flaring. But Sadie continued to rub salt in the wound, seemingly oblivious to the other woman’s anger.
“You’re mistaken about one thing, though.” She cocked her head to the side and smirked. “Nathan is marrying into the Wall family. I doubt we would be family. Is the Johnson family trying to establish ties with the Wall family as well?”
 ?   → g?ν
Ophelia’s expression changed drastically. What was Sadie implying? The Johnson family might hold some standing in Beversea, but matching the Wall family’s power and influence was nothing short of delusional.
Ophelia’s lips curled in displeasure. Her hands shook with anger, and her throat worked as she struggled to find the words to say.
Noah, who had been watching in silence the whole time, suddenly stood up. His looming figure towered over the women, the patience in his voice obvious when he said, “Why is it so noisy around here? It’s so early in the day, and some insect is already buzzing around, ruining the morning’s calm.”
He didn’t have to be specific—everyone present knew he was referring to Ophelia.
Ophelia’s face flushed in embarrassment, but Noah didn’t even spare her a glance. Instead, he nodded toward Sadie and spoke as if they were close.
“It looks like the air around here isn’t so good, Ms. Hudson. Why don’t we move somewhere else to finish our breakfast?”
Sadie had no desire to deal with Ophelia for a second longer—even looking at her was grating on her nerves—so she nodded without hesitation.
.

###Chapter 891:
“Sure.”
With that, she followed Noah out of the dining hall. Tina acted quickly, picking up the invitation from the table before hurrying after the two.
In the blink of an eye, Ophelia was left alone, just standing there. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides as she gnashed her teeth and seethed. Sadie, that woman! Ophelia swore to herself that she would never let her off. Never!
Meanwhile, Sadie and Noah walked into the elevator one after the other. Sadie instinctively stepped to the side to put some distance between them. In such a confined space, his familiar scent stirred a sense of unease within her.
Noah, on the other hand, acted as if he wasn’t aware of what she was doing.
He drew closer to her, and closer still, until he was practically pressed against her, trapping her in the corner.
Sadie looked up and scowled at him, her gaze indignant and wary at the same time. “Do you need something, Mr. Noel?”
Noah took a moment to gaze at her. Most of his face was hidden under his silver mask, and only his deep eyes were visible. She could tell he was smiling by the way they crinkled at the corners.
“Aren’t you hungry? Where would you like to eat, Ms. Hudson?”
Sadie’s eyes narrowed. Hadn’t he said that he lost his wallet? Why was he asking her where she wanted to eat now? What on earth was this man up to?
Noah bristled under her sharp gaze. Then he realized why she was practically glaring at him, and he chuckled softly.
“I’ll take you there, but you’ll pay the bill. We both make some contributions. Isn’t it a good idea?”
g0ν., ? ? ?
Sadie was rendered speechless by his utter lack of shame. This time, she glared at him outright.
“I don’t feel like eating anymore. If you’re hungry, Mr. Noel, feel free to enjoy your breakfast alone.”
Thankfully, the elevator doors opened just as she finished speaking. Sadie walked out without wasting another second.
Noah’s expression clouded as he watched her go. Then Jack appeared out of nowhere, walking up to him as he emerged from the elevator.noveldrama
“Were you rejected again, Mr. Noel?” Jack asked.
Noah shot him a menacing glare, causing Jack to shrink back. He pressed his lips into a thin line, not daring to utter another word.
Noah tugged at his tie, his irritation evident. He thought about the situation for a while and decided that he couldn’t give up easily.
“Call Nathan. Tell him to invite Sadie out to dinner tonight.”
Jack paused, momentarily surprised by his boss’s order. Then understanding dawned on him.
.
.
.
###Chapter 892:
“Yes, I’ll take care of it right away.” His boss sure was going to great lengths to win back Ms. Hudson.
Noah stormed back into his room and tossed his suit jacket on the sofa. His brooding was interrupted by the shrill ringing of his phone.
It was Hailey.
He answered the call, and her sickly sweet, pandering voice came through. “Where are you, Noah? I haven’t seen you in days. I miss you so much.”
Noah walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, his entire demeanor chilly. Hailey had always managed to trigger his temper.
“What do you want?” he snapped.
On the other end, Hailey shuddered at his tone. She immediately dropped her coquettish act, her voice taking on a cautious edge.
“I just wanted to tell you… My dad is coming back to the country.”
Noah’s eyes narrowed. Forest?
“Got it,” was all he said before hanging up without waiting for Hailey to respond.
Hailey listened to the monotonous beeps for longer than necessary, her body shaking with rage. She smashed her phone on the floor with a scream, shattering the screen.
“Damn it!”
Noah, that bastard, had really gone all the way to Beversea for that woman, Sadie! He had been there for so long, yet not once had he thought to call her. And now, he was treating her like she was a nobody.noveldrama
On the bright side, Sadie had done something that came as a pleasant surprise for once. That wretched woman was actually going to marry Nathan, a spoiled and debauched young man from the Higgins family. What a truly unexpected turn of events.
Th3 l4t3st upd4t3s 4v41l4bl3 0n g4ln0v3ls.c0m
Hailey huffed, her eyes glinting with malice. After giving it some thought, she grabbed her spare phone and made a call. If she wasn’t mistaken, Briley was currently filming something in Beversea.
The line rang a few times before it was finally picked up.
“Who is this? Do you realize how busy I am?” Briley snapped impatiently.
Hailey suppressed her disdain and tried to sound concerned. “It’s me, Hailey. I was just wondering if you’re aware that your dear cousin-in-law is once again in the limelight. Apparently, she is now engaged to a member of the Higgins family. Not only that, but I heard she’s also planning to collaborate with the Higgins Group.”
She paused to let her words sink in, then continued, “Once she returns from Beversea, her position will be even more secure, and we might never have the chance to bring her down. After all, the Wall Group virtually controls Jazmah, and she’s the one who calls the shots in the company.”
Briley pondered this in silence. She had heard rumors from the film crew that said as much, but she had always dismissed them as jokes or groundless narratives.
.
.
.
###Chapter 893:
“What are you trying to say?”
“I think we should do something as soon as possible,” Hailey suggested.
“To make sure Sadie never returns to Jazmah?” Briley asked.
Hailey’s lips curled into a cunning smile as she thought Briley was truly a fool among fools. She chuckled lightly, her tone shifting into a casual one.
“Oh, never mind, Briley. I guess I’m just venting a bit. After all, the Higgins family rules over Beversea. What can we do, really? Well, anyway, I have something else to do. Let’s talk again some other time.”
With that, Hailey hung up the phone.
She knew that tipping off Briley was enough. That girl wouldn’t miss a single opportunity to destroy her sworn enemy. And the best part? Even if Briley messed things up, no one would be able to trace her actions back to Hailey.
Sure enough, in a lounge at the Beversea Film Base, Briley was stewing over the new information she had just received. The Higgins family? Who did they think they were? Did they think they could compete with her family?
She clicked her tongue in frustration, mentally berating Hailey for being useless. Why was Hailey always dancing around the problem instead of taking immediate action? Unlike Hailey, she was fearless. She was a Wall, after all. If she had her way, Sadie would have been dealt with ages ago!noveldrama
The more Briley thought about it, the more excited she became. She jumped to her feet, grabbed her designer handbag, and made to leave the set.
Just then, a young girl from the logistics team entered the room with a cup of water. When she saw Briley heading out, she asked cautiously, “Are you leaving, Miss Wall? But you still have scenes to film on today’s schedule.”
Briley was already irritated, and the girl’s words only annoyed her further. They should be thankful she had even graced this shabby set and crew with her presence in the first place; now, one of them dared to block her path?
Don’t miss it: g?lиov.cоm
Without any warning, Briley kicked the girl in the shin with her sharp stiletto. “Get lost! How dare you get in my way? Just find a stand-in to shoot the scenes. What’s the big deal? If you can’t even handle such a small task, what’s the use of having you here?”
The girl stumbled, dropping the cup and spilling water everywhere. Her eyes turned red with unshed tears, but she was too frightened to openly weep. She simply shrank back, clutching her leg.
Briley strutted to the door without sparing her another glance. The other crew members in the lounge kept their heads down, not daring to make a sound. Only a fool would think to provoke the spoiled princess, especially when she was in such a state.
Briley walked straight to the van waiting outside the set.
Leonard quickly stepped forward and opened the door for her. She climbed in and tossed her bag to the side.
.
.
.
###Chapter 894:
“Leonard, make some arrangements. Jarrett Higgins is getting married in two days, right? I want to attend his wedding.”
Leonard glanced at the rearview mirror and met Briley’s twisted expression. Her eyes were burning with ill intent.
“Alright, Miss Wall,” he replied respectfully. “I’ll take care of it right away.”
Leonard agreed, but his fingers were already typing a message under the steering wheel. He sent it before starting the engine. “Samuel, Briley plans to attend Jarrett’s wedding. Her purpose is unclear. Proceed with caution.”
After Sadie returned to her hotel room, she kicked off her high heels and massaged her temples. After a while, her phone beeped with a new message from Nathan. “Dinner tonight? I have something to discuss.” Sadie’s brows furrowed. Wasn’t he supposed to be busy with the handover at Higgins Group today? How could he even find the time to have dinner with her?
As puzzled as she was, Sadie didn’t care much about the invitation, so she didn’t reply right away.
Then her phone rang, and this time, it was Samuel calling.
Sadie took the call and pressed the phone against her ear. “Hello?”
“Ms. Hudson,” Samuel greeted respectfully. “I just received news that Briley has used her family’s connections to secure an invitation to Jarrett’s wedding. It seems that she is intent on attending.”
Sadie’s fingers tightened and flexed, her eyes narrowing. Since when did that spoiled princess become interested in arranged marriages between other people? Jarrett and Ophelia’s wedding should hold no significance to Briley; why did she want to be present at the event?
She was definitely up to something. It couldn’t be just about the wedding.
? : g?ν．?．．
“I got it,” Sadie replied calmly. “Make sure that more of our men are present at the wedding. Have them blend in with the guests and staff alike, and tell them to keep a close watch on Briley. I want to know what she plans to do this time.”noveldrama
“Copy that, Ms. Hudson,” Samuel replied.
A few seconds passed as he deliberated with himself.
“There’s one more thing, Ms. Hudson,” he finally said. “Since the news of your engagement with Nathan broke, Mr. Howe has tried to reach out to me several times. He wants to meet with you.”
Sadie inhaled slowly as Alex’s gentle face appeared in her mind. She had always considered him a trustworthy friend.
“I’ll meet him once I return to Jazmah. I just need to wrap things up here first.”
“Understood, Ms. Hudson.”
The line went dead, and the room returned to silence. Sadie walked to the window, a soft sigh escaping her lips.
Alex would have to wait for now. She had more pressing issues to deal with, namely the Higgins family and Briley.
.
.
.
###Chapter 895:noveldrama
Sadie was genuinely curious. What sort of trouble was Briley going to stir up at Jarrett’s wedding? Whatever it was, Briley would do well not to cross her. Otherwise, Sadie wouldn’t hesitate to teach Briley a lesson she would never forget.
Sadie made her way to Delicacy House that evening, a place celebrated for its fine dining in Beversea. She climbed to the second floor, guided by the room number Nathan had texted her earlier.
Gently nudging the door that was left slightly open, she stepped inside. Nathan was there, sitting with an unusually stiff posture. Across from him, to her surprise, sat Noah.
Sadie froze mid-step, the truth hitting her all at once. It all made sense now; Nathan, overwhelmed with his new role at Higgins Group, shouldn’t have had the time to dine out. Yet here he was, inviting her to dinner.
Clearly, Noah had orchestrated this meeting. He truly was willing to go as far as it took, no matter how low or cunning the method.
When Nathan saw Sadie, his expression shifted dramatically to one of immense relief, as though he were on the verge of tears. He stole a quick glance at Noah, who held a cup in his hand, his smile soft but his presence sharp enough to command the entire room.
Nathan remained meticulously silent. What miserable luck! How on earth did he wind up dining with the devil in the flesh?
A surge of frustration caused Sadie’s temple to pulse. Silently, she decided to leave.
“Wait!” Noah blurted out, rising swiftly from his seat as she turned to go. He moved quickly, catching up to her and clasping her wrist.
“You’ve already made the trip here,” he murmured, a subtle smile coloring his tone. “Why not join us for dinner before leaving?”

As Sadie turned to face him, irritation was evident in her expression. How had she gone so long without realizing just how relentless Noah could be? He was like a stubborn piece of chewing gum stuck to the bottom of her shoe—no matter what she did, he wouldn’t come off.
“Let go of me,” Sadie said.
But Noah tightened his hold instead. He gazed deeply into her eyes, which now shimmered with a mix of anger and allure. A familiar ache pierced him, sharp and sudden. His brow creased with the intensity of the feeling, his complexion turning a shade paler. He subconsciously raised a hand to his forehead, beads of sweat breaking out along his hairline.
Lately, these pounding headaches seemed to be showing up more and more often.
A pang of concern tightened Sadie’s chest. Her annoyance dissipated, replaced by a wave of worry.
“What’s happening?” she asked. “Do you feel ill?”
Noah dismissed her concerns with a shake of his head, struggling against the encroaching dizziness. His hold on her wrist grew firmer, as though he was clinging to a lifeline. He lifted his gaze, the gloom in his eyes exposing a side of him that was almost never seen—fragile and unguarded.
.
.
.
###Chapter 896:
“So, will you stay?”
Sadie’s expression darkened. It was the same maneuver he always used. Yet, confronted with his visibly frail state, she found it impossible to leave.
Observing silently until now, Nathan seized the opportunity to interject. He sprang to his feet, wearing a smile.
“Ms. Hudson, now that you’re here, why not stick around? There are some things about my company I want to discuss with you. And honestly, it’d be a waste to let all that food we ordered go uneaten!”
The last thing he wanted was to end up alone with Patrick again—the weight of it all was more than he could handle.
With resignation, Sadie nodded. “Fine.”
Her gaze shifted back to Noah, her voice softening.
“Are you sure you’re alright? Should we get you to a hospital?”
Noah gave a slow shake of his head, but the faint trace of frailty still clung to his face. “I’ll manage.”
As they settled in, the table soon brimmed with an array of exquisite dishes. Nathan reached for the utensils, eager to serve Sadie, but a stern look from Noah halted him mid-motion. Nathan awkwardly pulled back his hand and began to nibble on his meal.
He then decided it was time to address more pressing matters.
“Ms. Hudson,” he said, clearing his throat with a bit of formality, “Jarrett is marrying Ophelia the day after tomorrow. Any thoughts on their union?”
Sadie met his question with a mischievous look.
Lat3zt chapt3rz found at glovels.
“Having second thoughts, Mr. Higgins? Tempted to steal the bride for yourself?”
Caught off guard, Nathan sputtered, struggling to regain his composure. He had no romantic interest in Jarrett’s fiancée whatsoever. To him, Ophelia was utterly unappealing; he would never consider her.
“Please, Ms. Hudson, let’s be serious,” he responded hastily, gesturing dismissively. “I just think that with Jarrett marrying a Johnson, their agendas will end up even more tightly bound. It’ll be even more difficult to deal with Jarrett at the company.”
Sadie paused to sip her drink, pondering his words.
“If that’s how things stand,” she said slowly, her voice heavy with suggestion, “why not send someone to cause a scene at the wedding? If the ceremony falls apart, wouldn’t that solve everyone’s problems?”
Nathan, taken aback by her suggestion, suddenly saw the potential. Then, as the idea clicked into place, his eyes lit with excitement. Was Sadie really suggesting they should send someone to throw the whole event into chaos and break the alliance?
Genius.
Realizing he had grasped her idea, Sadie smiled approvingly. Maybe he wasn’t as foolish as she’d assumed.noveldrama
.
.
.
###Chapter 897:
“I know exactly what to do now!” Nathan grinned excitedly. Overall, he was just relieved that he wouldn’t have to cause a scene at the wedding ceremony himself.
“I went to the office today and acted like a total airhead. I’m pretty sure Jarrett’s cronies still think I’m an idiot!”
He had barely finished speaking when he felt the prickle of an icy gaze fixed on him. Noah was glaring at him.
Nathan felt a chill run down his spine. He immediately set his cutlery down and shot to his feet.
“Well, then, Ms. Hudson, Mr. Noel, I just remembered that I have something urgent to take care of. I’m sorry, but I’ll have to take my leave now. Please enjoy the rest of your meal!”
He didn’t wait for either of them to respond and hurried out of the room. His instincts told him that if he stayed a minute longer, he might not make it out alive.
Sadie was at a loss as she watched Nathan flee. That rascal sure had a knack for avoiding trouble.
She cast a sideways glance at Noah. The traces of pain that had been in his eyes just a while ago were now gone, replaced by that odd, fragile look.
He picked up his utensils and proceeded to choose morsels of food from the spread, placing them on her plate with deliberate care.
“What a shame,” Noah remarked casually. “We have a veritable feast here, but Mr. Higgins had to leave before he could finish it.”
Sadie raised an eyebrow and gave him a glare. Noah must have picked up acting in the last three years.
Noah caught the silent warning in her expression and immediately shut his mouth. It would do him good to refrain from teasing her further.

And so, the rest of dinner passed in silence.
When they were done, a server came in with a card reader and waited for them to settle the bill.
He paused by the table and glanced back and forth between the two. His eyes glinted with meaning, as if he had already decided in his mind that these two guests were a married couple.
Making up his mind, he leaned over to Sadie with a bright smile.
“Madam, your total comes to eight thousand dollars. How would you like to pay?”
Beneath his mask, Noah’s lips twitched into a smile. He was in high spirits, and he smoothly reached into the inner pocket of his suit jacket for a sleek black card.noveldrama
Noah handed it over to the server and said, “I’ll take care of the bill.”
The server paused and stared for two whole seconds before accepting the card with a respectful bow. “Sure, sir.” Then he scurried to a side table to process the payment.
Sadie watched the whole exchange with cold detachment. It was still vivid in her mind how Noah had shamelessly claimed to have lost his wallet.
.
.
.
###Chapter 898:
Without a word, she grabbed her purse and strode to the door. Noah was immediately on his feet and followed close behind her.
They were passing the cash register outside when the server hurried out of the private room, brandishing Noah’s black card. “Sir, your card!”
Noah didn’t even break his stride. He simply reached out, plucked the card from the server’s outstretched hand, and slipped it back into his pocket in one fluid motion.
The hotel’s revolving doors turned. Sadie was walking towards her car when a tall figure blocked her path.
Noah again. Of course. Somehow, mask and all, he managed to look helpless.
“It’s a good thing I still have my card, even though my wallet’s gone,” he said. “I guess my luck isn’t all bad.”
He shifted to the side and gave Sadie a smile. “As an apology, may I escort you back to your hotel, Ms. Hudson?”
The bastard really took shamelessness to a whole new level. Sadie grumbled inwardly, but she kept her expression calm.
She walked around Noah and headed for the ostentatious Ferrari parked just a few steps ahead. “That won’t be necessary, Mr. Noel. I drove here.”
Sadie unlocked her car and slid into the driver’s seat. She hadn’t even closed the door when Noah yanked open the passenger side and climbed in with lightning speed.
He shut the door with a solid thud, buckled his seatbelt, and settled in as if the vehicle were his own. Then he turned to look at a stunned Sadie, his tone innocent and matter-of-fact.
“What a coincidence. My car seems to have broken down. You’ll give me a lift, won’t you, Ms. Hudson?”

Sadie’s upper lip curled in exasperation, but she said nothing as she slammed her door closed.
Noah had been acting so out of character these past two days. First, he had shown up out of nowhere at the Higgins Manor, and now here he was, using excuse after flimsy excuse to mooch off her. She took a deep breath to temper her annoyance. When she looked at him, her gaze was cold as ice.
“Mr. Noel,” Sadie said quietly, “what are you trying to do, exactly?”
Noah’s eyes were drawn to her furrowed brows. Instead of answering her question, he leaned in, closing the distance between them.
The already cramped space seemed to shrink even further as he asserted his presence. He was so close, close enough that his warm breath fanned Sadie’s cheek.
His eyes were deep and unreadable, his voice low and steady when he said, “Ms. Hudson, if you’re determined to find a man to marry into your family, why don’t you pick me instead?”
The air inside the car grew thick and heavy, a subtle, charged tension crackling between them.
.
.
.
###Chapter 899:
Sadie froze in her seat. She couldn’t believe what she had just heard.
What sort of nonsense was he spouting now?
Warmth bloomed on her cheeks, spreading to her ears, and she knew they were flushed red. Her heart was hammering inside her chest. But Noah had lost his memory, and he had already chosen to be with Hailey. So why was he acting like he wanted to pursue her? How was she supposed to interpret his behavior?
Embarrassment, confusion, and a strange flutter of excitement all swirled within her.noveldrama
Thankfully, Sadie snapped back to her senses in just a matter of seconds. Acting on instinct, she shoved Noah away.
“Stop it.”
Noah obliged, straightening back in his seat and giving her back her space. But he had seen her blush and that brief, flustered look that crossed her face. He smiled knowingly to himself.
Sadie, on the other hand, swallowed a lump in her throat and gripped the steering wheel. She took a moment to compose herself, and when she looked at him again, she was back to her cool, aloof self. The blush hadn’t completely faded, though.
Suddenly, Sadie flashed Noah a challenging grin, taking him by surprise.
“If you’re so eager to hitch a ride, Mr. Noel, then you’d better hold on tight!”
The words had barely registered in Noah’s mind when Sadie floored the accelerator. The engine roared to life, and the red Ferrari shot forward, gliding into traffic.
Noah was slammed back into his seat as the car surged forward with a jolt of raw power. His body jerked with the sudden motion, helpless against the G-force that pinned him in place. Outside, the world blurred into streaks of color, the landscape vanishing in a head-spinning flash.
Instinctively, his hand shot up to grip the handle above the door.
 ?   @ ν﹒
This woman—she must have done it on purpose.
He turned sharply to look at Sadie. Her gaze was fixed on the road, unwavering, but the corners of her mouth curled ever so slightly. There it was—a mischievous little smile, laced with quiet satisfaction, a smile that said she knew exactly what she was doing.
Noah’s brow creased. This kind of driving—reckless, aggressive, and utterly unrelenting—was a far cry from the composed precision of a polished chairwoman. It was wild. Untamed. A flash of realization flickered through his mind, but it vanished before he could fully grasp it.
He stopped trying to rationalize and simply tightened his grip on the handle. Fine. If she wanted to play this game, he’d go along for the ride.
The red Ferrari roared down the road, a blur of speed and control. When it finally executed a flawless drift and rolled to a stop in front of the Emerald Hotel, Noah felt momentarily weightless.
Adrenaline still surged through him as he stepped out, his legs barely steady. He drew in a deep breath, trying to tame the chaos thrumming in his chest.

###Chapter 900:
Sadie, in contrast, moved with practiced ease. She unbuckled, stepped out, and made her way around the car without so much as a hair out of place.
As she passed his side, she leaned in briefly, a smirk tugging at her lips.
“Mr. Noel, you’re welcome to tag along next time.”
Then she turned on her heel and strutted into the lobby, heels tapping smartly against the pavement. Not once did she look back.
Noah let out a long breath, pressing his fingers to his temple. This woman was becoming increasingly fascinating—and maddeningly unpredictable.
By the time Sadie’s silhouette vanished into the hotel, Jack, who had been lurking behind a nearby pillar, finally emerged. He took one look at Noah, slightly rumpled and visibly rattled, and had to fight hard to suppress a grin.
In all the years he’d known the man, this was a first—Noah Noel, completely thrown off his game. And it was all Sadie’s doing. Honestly, it was a rare treat to behold.
Still, despite his inward amusement, Jack managed to school his expression into one of mild, professional concern.
“Mr. Noel,” he said, stepping closer and lowering his voice, “would you care for some water? Might help you settle your nerves.”
Noah looked up, his icy glare sharp enough to freeze the air between them. Jack instantly regretted his comment. He straightened up, clearing his throat and erasing all traces of mirth from his face. That glare could send a man to an early grave.
Jack figured it was best not to push his luck. He wisely fell silent.noveldrama
Meanwhile, Sadie was already making her way back to her suite, entirely unbothered. A small blur shot out from behind the living room sofa like a little rocket and launched straight into her arms.
“Mommy!”
Sadie immediately crouched down, catching the bundle of energy in a tight embrace. The familiar, sweet scent of Averi washed over her, and in that moment, every trace of exhaustion and stress from the past few days seemed to dissolve.
She gently tousled his soft hair, her voice instinctively dropping to a tender murmur.
“Averi? Wait, what are you doing here?”
Still nestled in her arms, Averi looked up at her with wide, shining eyes.
He pouted, his little face full of complaint.
“I missed you so much, Mommy! So I asked Breck to bring me all the way to Beversea to find you!”
Without waiting for a response, Averi flung his little arms around Sadie’s neck and planted a big, smacking kiss on her cheek.
“Mommy, I missed you this much!” he declared, stretching his arms as far as they could go.
Sadie’s heart melted into a puddle. That tiny embrace, that earnest affection—it pierced straight through her armor. Three long years of late nights, boardroom battles, and endless work had stolen moments like this from her. Moments she could never get back.

###Chapter 901:
She scooped him up into her arms, holding him close as she carried him toward the bedroom. Her smile was gentle, but there was something regretful in her eyes.
“That’s on me, baby. I’ve been too caught up with work and haven’t spent enough time with you. But tonight… how about I tell you a story? Just you and me.”
“Really? Yay!” Averi’s face lit up like the stars had come out just for him, the earlier sulk gone in an instant.
Averi tightened his hug around Sadie’s neck and planted another loud, smacking kiss on her cheek.
“Mommy, you’re the best!”
His joyful grin was like sunshine breaking through storm clouds. In that instant, the heaviness in Sadie’s chest melted away. Nothing in the world mattered more than her son’s laughter. As for the worries clouding her mind, she’d face them when the time came.
Before long, the day of Jarrett’s wedding arrived. It was a grand affair, marking the union of the prestigious Higgins and Johnson families. The venue: Magnolia Grand—the most opulent hotel in Beversea.
A rich red carpet spilled down the front steps, framed by cascades of fresh blooms. Luxury cars gleamed along the drive, and a steady stream of finely dressed guests flowed inside.
As Sadie stepped gracefully out of her car, Rodger caught sight of her and immediately lit up.
With a broad smile, he hurried over, his posture respectful and his tone deferential.
“Oh, Ms. Hudson! We’ve been eagerly awaiting your arrival!” He gestured politely, ushering her forward.
Every story unfolds at gα?ησν?s．
“Please, come in! It’s been a whirlwind of a day—if anything’s amiss, I hope you’ll forgive us.”
Rodger’s face glowed with pride, his joy radiating from every line. At last, his firstborn—the one he held in highest esteem—was tying the knot. A long-awaited relief settled in his chest.
Sadie offered a courteous nod.
“Mr. Higgins, you’re remarkably kind in your expression.”
Her tone remained cool, detached, making it clear she intended to keep things strictly professional.
Rodger’s eyes wandered until they locked onto someone hunched at the back, clearly uninterested and scrolling endlessly on his device. It was Nathan.
Rodger’s cheerful expression vanished, his mood souring instantly. That layabout!
With brisk, deliberate steps, he stormed over and struck the base of Nathan’s chair with a solid kick.noveldrama
Nathan had been so fixated on his screen that he didn’t notice the sudden jolt—his seat kicked away, his legs flailed, and he crashed to the floor, landing squarely on his tailbone.

###Chapter 902:
“Argh!” he groaned, wincing as he scrambled upright, cheeks flushed with humiliation.
Rodger’s blood boiled at the sight of his son lounging carelessly during such an important occasion. His elder child was getting married—this was meant to be a joyous day—and here Nathan was, playing with his phone in the shadows.
“You little menace! Didn’t you notice Ms. Hudson just stepped in?”
Still rubbing his rear, Nathan gave an indifferent shrug.
“I’m not the one getting married. Why should I waste time standing around?”
Rodger clenched his fists, his pulse hammering in his temples. He resisted the urge to lash out physically again. This boy never made his life easy. But with Sadie nearby, he forced himself to rein it in.
Now wasn’t the time to make a scene.
Rodger’s tone dropped into something sharp and commanding. “Ms. Hudson holds special status today. Show her proper courtesy. Cross a line, and you’ll regret it.”
He decided it was wiser to let Nathan accompany Sadie than to let him linger here as an eyesore.
Orders given, he switched personas with ease, flashing a warm grin as he faced Sadie. “Ms. Hudson, please step in and explore. I still have guests to greet, so I’ll leave you for now.”
Sadie’s face remained unreadable. “Certainly, Mr. Higgins. Please, go ahead.”
Rodger acknowledged her with a pleasant nod and melted into the crowd.
Once he was out of sight, Sadie glanced toward Nathan, who was still wincing and rubbing his lower back. His expression said it all—everything was in motion.
He caught her eye, and the usual smirk vanished. Leaning in close, he murmured, “Don’t worry, Ms. Hudson. Trust me, you have nothing to worry about. Things are about to get… interesting.”

Nathan looked thrilled at the chaos brewing beneath the surface—finally, there was a chance to channel his simmering frustration.
Sadie gave a tiny nod. Just this once, she’d trust him.
“Lead the way.”
Nathan inclined his head and swept an arm to the side, silently beckoning her forward.
Sadie approached the grand hall, though a strange tension clung to her. It was as if invisible eyes tracked her every movement, an unseen presence gnawing at her nerves.
Just outside the building, Rodger stood in animated conversation with a handful of suited men, laughter bubbling amid the casual chatter. Suddenly, a deafening engine roar sliced through the calm like a blade. A garishly painted Lamborghini—bright violet, impossible to miss—screeched past the staff, shattered through the checkpoint, and boldly tore across the meticulously arranged floral carpet.noveldrama
The spectacle silenced the crowd in an instant. Rodger’s grin froze.

###Chapter 903:
Who would dare create such a scene on the day of his son’s wedding? Rodger bristled, ready to lash out, when the Lamborghini’s winged door lifted skyward. Out stepped a leg, draped in couture only the ultra-wealthy could touch.
It was a woman, her face immaculately made up, eyes hidden behind massive designer lenses. Her posture radiated defiance and theatrical flair.
It was Briley.
Every reporter whipped around, lenses zooming in, camera flashes firing in rapid bursts. Briley soaked up the frenzy like a seasoned celebrity. Pulling off her glasses with a dramatic flourish, she flashed a sugary grin meant for the headlines and offered a practiced wave, as though she’d been born beneath stage lights.
Rodger’s features tightened the moment he recognized her. Then, almost mechanically, his expression softened. Offending someone from the Wall family was far from wise—especially now.
He mustered a cordial expression and hustled forward.
“Miss Wall! A true pleasure! Ms. Hudson has just gone ahead—please, allow me to show you in!”
Briley’s mouth curled into a brittle smile. Without a word, she slid the shades back over her eyes, dismissed him with a blank stare, and strode past without slowing.
Rodger’s jaw clenched. The rumors were true—this woman was every bit the entitled menace they claimed.
Inside, Briley advanced like she owned the place, each step sharp and deliberate, ignoring the opulence and the guests. Leonard was quick to catch up.
Briley turned slightly, her tone glacial, her hidden gaze glittering with veiled menace.
L?ττ ch?ρτ?rs ιn glov?ls.?noveldrama
“Leonard, is everything ready?”
Leonard gave a small bow, his tone polished and dutiful. “Everything is in motion, Miss Wall. You needn’t be concerned.” But inwardly, he sneered. This clueless brat really believed she could bring Sadie down?
Briley gave a nod, her lips twisting into a cruel, satisfied smirk.
She was eager to see how Sadie would handle the coming storm. Today, she was determined that Sadie’s humiliation would be absolute.
Within the banquet hall, Sadie cradled a glass of champagne, her eyes gliding coolly across the gathered guests.
Noah was nowhere to be found. The realization crept in quietly, then settled with an odd twist of amusement. Only days ago, he had been glued to her side, impossible to shake—like gum stuck to the sole of a shoe. And now? Not even a shadow of him in sight at an event this grand. Strange, to say the least.
She considered asking Nathan to check if Noah was hiding somewhere nearby. Oddly enough, in the absence of Noah’s usual presence, a faint sense of unease began to creep over her. Before that feeling could take root, she brushed it off with practiced ease.

###Chapter 904:
Pivoting, she made her way toward the lounge, hoping to steal a few minutes of quiet.
But someone staggered toward her, their drink sloshing dangerously in their glass. It was Briley.
There wasn’t enough time to dodge. Sadie barely moved an inch before it happened.
With a sharp splash, an entire glass of rich crimson liquid tumbled across the soft apricot gown she had so thoughtfully selected for the day. The deep stain bled fast, standing out harshly against the delicate, light fabric.
For a heartbeat, silence swept through the room. Every eye in the crowd locked onto her at once.
Briley looked startled, her face a picture of panic. In a rush, she placed her glass aside and, clearly shaken, snatched a napkin from the tray of a passing waiter.
“Oh no! Sadie! I’m so, so sorry! I didn’t mean to do that, I swear!” Her words tumbled out as she dabbed furiously at the ruined gown, only making things worse. The stain spread like wildfire under her hands.
The outcome was exactly what one might expect. What began as a minor spill rapidly spread, the stain growing darker until the dress was utterly ruined.
Briley looked down at the mess she’d made, her expression carefully balanced with just enough distress to appear genuine—almost as if she had practiced it in front of a mirror. Her eyes glistened with tears that hadn’t quite fallen.
“Sadie, you… you’re not upset with me, are you? I swear I didn’t mean to.”
With her sorrowful look and flawless features, she played the perfect image of a helpless, distressed beauty.
Sadie glanced at the reporters, their cameras raised like vultures circling overhead. Internally, she rolled her eyes. Briley’s performance was nothing short of award-worthy—she could easily walk away with an Oscar for that level of acting.noveldrama
Fresh chapters uploaded on gα?ησvls?c?m
But Sadie had witnessed ploys like this more times than she could count and saw right through them. Instead of revealing her true feelings, she offered the crowd a soft, polished smile. Measured. Completely unfazed.
“Don’t worry. It’s just a minor spill. I’ll head upstairs and change.”
The more she brushed it off, the tighter Briley’s expression became. Of course Briley hated this. She had expected a meltdown, or at least a dramatic exit. But Sadie wasn’t giving her either.
Before the awkwardness could settle any deeper, a lazy drawl cut through the tension.
“Why does it feel like I walked into a soap opera?”
Nathan had at last slipped away from a pack of relentless drinking buddies. As he made his way over, he noticed the cluster of people forming and pushed through them, arriving just in time to catch sight of the sprawling wine stain on Sadie’s dress and the carefully crafted guilt on Briley’s face.
Catching on immediately, Nathan let out a sharp scoff.
Briley, the spoiled little princess, clearly hadn’t come for the celebration—she came to cause chaos.
.

###Chapter 905:
He stepped right up beside Sadie, a note of concern coloring his voice.
“Ms. Hudson, are you alright?”
Sadie offered a small nod in response.
Without missing a beat, Nathan signaled to a nearby waiter.
“Can’t you see Ms. Hudson’s dress is completely ruined? Hurry up and escort her upstairs to change!”
His voice was sharp, filled with irritation.
The waiter responded with a quick, courteous nod and motioned politely to Sadie.
“Ms. Hudson, this way please. We have spare gowns and a lounge upstairs.”
Sadie didn’t speak. She simply turned and followed the waiter upstairs. A flicker of satisfaction gleamed in Briley’s eyes.
She straightened her posture, then turned toward Nathan, slipping on that familiar, well-rehearsed smile as she held out her hand.
“You must be Mr. Nathan Higgins, right?”noveldrama
Her tone was sweet and overly familiar, every word laced with artificial charm.
“I’ve heard so much about you—tall, refined, and the perfect gentleman everyone talks about. Now that I’ve met you in person, I can see the hearsay is true. I’m Briley, the cousin of Sadie’s late husband.”
Nathan raised an eyebrow. He could tell right away that Briley had done it on purpose. But he had more important things to handle than confronting her. He flashed the signature smug grin of a pampered heir, took her outstretched fingers, and gave them a light, calculated shake.
“Miss Wall, what an honor to meet you.”
  ? ?: g?ν
He acted as if he hadn’t known her identity before, adding a note of charm to his smile.
“Please, Miss Wall, this way. Let me walk you to the main table.” He pretended not to catch the meaning behind her words, not to see what had just happened.
When Briley saw his seemingly sensible reaction, some of her irritation began to fade. At least he understood the room.
She pulled her hand back calmly and tipped her chin up, letting him know he could go ahead. Nathan gestured for her to follow him. She, standing tall in her heels, followed him, carrying herself like royalty.
As they turned the corner, Nathan slipped a little. His foot shifted to the side, but then his heel came down—right on the train of Briley’s gown.
She lost her balance instantly. A sharp gasp escaped her lips as she lurched forward. She hit the floor with a flat thud, her face scraping against the surface as the sting spread quickly. Shame settled deep in her chest. Gasps echoed across the room. A few people tried to stifle their laughter but failed.
The reporters didn’t miss a beat. Flashes popped like fireworks, snapping photos of her fall in perfect, painful clarity.
.
.
.
###Chapter 906:
On the floor, she could feel the sting in her knees and the throbbing in her chin. Her hair had come loose, and her makeup was probably ruined. She was so embarrassed she wanted to disappear right then and there.
“Ouch.”
She tried to get up, but the gown twisted around her legs and her heels only made things worse.
Leonard, who had been trailing behind her, looked genuinely startled by what had happened. Panic washed over his face as he rushed forward and knelt beside her.
“Briley! Are you okay?” His voice trembled with worry. His hands moved carefully, as if she might break.
The pain was sharp enough to make Briley’s eyes sting. She tried to push herself up, fury rising fast. Leonard leaned in to help, but she shoved him aside without hesitation.
Then she turned toward Nathan, her glare burning with indignation. That bastard. How dare he humiliate her like this? She wasn’t about to let it slide.
Nathan looked like he’d only just noticed her fall. His expression carried just enough surprise to seem believable. He rushed over, stopping just short of touching her, his voice oozing with staged concern.
“Oh no! Miss Wall, are you hurt? This is awful—the hall’s way too cramped for someone of your status. And this floor, it’s too slippery, letting someone like you fall like that. It’s shameful, really. We’re completely at fault.”
The words sounded kind, but each one dripped with mockery disguised as apology, emphasizing she was too grand for a place like this, so out of touch that she would trip and fall.
But Briley didn’t catch the sarcasm at all. She only heard the flattery, mistaking it for Nathan’s way of saying the Higgins family’s venue wasn’t good enough for her.
 ?   → a?ν
Some of her anger melted away, replaced by the sting of humiliation. She gave a sharp snort and started tugging her dress back into place, her voice cold.
“Glad that you know.”
Without checking if she was even bleeding, she pushed herself up. She didn’t want help. She just wanted out.
She shot a glare at the people still whispering and giggling, raised her chin, and walked off toward the main table. Leonard followed behind. Watching her stiff, hurried steps, he let out a sigh.
She was truly clueless. Nathan’s sarcasm had been loud enough to echo—yet she hadn’t caught a thing.
Sadie had asked him to keep watch on Briley, but now it seemed she had given her too much credit. With that kind of mind, how could Briley ever stir up real trouble? She was beyond help.
Upstairs, on the second floor, a server guided Sadie to a quiet lounge dressed in soft lighting and muted colors. The server stepped aside and opened the door with a courteous nod.

###Chapter 907:
“Ms. Hudson, you can change in here. There are several gowns in the wardrobe, all brand new. If you need anything, just press the call button.”
Sadie offered a small nod. “Thank you.”
The server gave a brief bow and pulled the door shut without another word.
Sadie walked to the wardrobe and opened it. Inside were several gowns—sleek silhouettes, rich fabrics, soft colors. Each one looked as if it had been made with her in mind.
She reached for a strapless champagne gown. It was understated, but graceful. She turned, ready to take off her stained dress.
The chandelier above her flickered twice. Then, with a soft click, everything went dark. Her heart jumped.
She froze, instinctively alert, her eyes straining to see through the sudden blackness. She couldn’t see a thing, but she could hear everything.
She could hear her own breath, sharp and unsteady.
At that instant, without warning, a set of chilled fingers closed over Sadie’s lips from behind, catching her off balance.
Sadie froze, her muscles tensing automatically, ready for a counterattack. But then, a familiar floral scent teased her nose.
That scent—lavender. Noah.noveldrama
His voice, soft and low, brushed her ear, stirring a nervous flutter. “It’s me.”
Downstairs in the banquet hall, Nathan strode tensely near the staircase leading upward. Every few moments, his eyes darted between the clock on his wrist and the landing above. What was taking so long? It was just an outfit switch—why the delay?
He’d never admit it out loud, but he silently blamed it on women’s tendency to overcomplicate things. He knew better than to let Sadie catch him thinking that way.

Just then, Rodger marched over, displeasure written across his face. Seeing Nathan standing by himself made his expression sour even further.
“Where is Ms. Hudson? Why are you hovering here alone?”
Nathan swiftly erased the tension from his features and gestured toward the staircase. “She got something on her dress and went up to change.”
That explanation finally eased the stiffness in Rodger’s jaw. His regard for Sadie was immense, and upsetting her wasn’t an option.
He shot Nathan a warning look, his voice low but firm. “Don’t pull any stunts today. It’s your brother’s big day—if anything goes sideways, you’ll deal with me.”
Nathan pressed his lips together, saying nothing. Inside, though, part of him longed for some disruption.
Just then, the lighting in the hall dimmed, casting a spotlight over the main platform.
The host, smartly dressed, stepped forward with a practiced smile and took the microphone.

###Chapter 908:
“Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, good day! We now commence the union of Mr. Jarrett Higgins and Miss Ophelia Johnson. Kindly return to your seats and join us in witnessing this joyous occasion!”
Soft instrumental music began to play, adding a touch of elegance to the atmosphere.
Rodger didn’t spare Nathan another glance—he simply returned to his seat at the head table. Nathan gave the staircase one last look, then, with no better option, chose a vacant chair tucked to the side of the hall and sat down.
Moments later, Sadie and Noah entered together from the opposite end of the venue. Nathan blinked, confused.
What was going on? Why were they arriving as a pair? What had unfolded between them? They looked composed, as if nothing had shifted.
Right on cue, the wedding march began. Ophelia, radiant in a pure white wedding gown, walked slowly down the aisle on Daren’s arm. The dimmed lighting and gentle melody lent the room a fairytale air.
Ophelia’s eyes briefly flicked in Nathan’s direction. She looked absolutely stunning.
The host’s deep, captivating voice carried through the hall, prompting applause from the guests.
Suddenly, a loud, trembling voice shattered the calm.
“Jarrett! You can’t marry her!”
A woman in another white gown stormed inside, tear-streaked and visibly shaken, heading straight for the groom.
Gasps echoed through the room as guests turned in stunned silence.
Rodger’s expression darkened like a brewing storm. The instant he saw the woman, recognition struck.noveldrama
 ?  ? ν?
It was Yvonne Blyant—his ex-girlfriend, raised by a single parent and forced to scrape by with menial gigs.
A flush of humiliation crept up Rodger’s neck as he barked at the security team, “Why are you just standing around? Get this lunatic out!” The bodyguards lunged into action.
But Yvonne resisted fiercely, refusing to budge. Her voice pierced the commotion like a siren.
“Mr. Higgins! I’m pregnant—and the baby is Jarrett’s!”
Rodger froze, stunned and speechless. Even Jarrett, who had been observing with an air of detachment, suddenly tensed.
Just as the hall descended into disorder, a new wave of visitors entered through the main doors—uniformed officers.
The one in charge marched toward Rodger, jaw tight, flashing his credentials.
.
.
.
###Chapter 909:
“Mr. Higgins, we’re responding to a theft report here at the venue. All apprehended suspects claim Miss Briley Wall orchestrated the plan. We require her cooperation in our inquiry.”
Briley, who had been sitting nearby, visibly enjoying the earlier scandal, was now stunned, her smirk gone.
“This… this has to be a misunderstanding!” she stammered, the blood draining from her face. “I never told anyone to take anything! I’m being framed!”
The reporters wasted no time. Flashbulbs erupted as they surged toward Briley, capturing every second.
No one had foreseen the scandals that would thunder through today’s wedding. First came the woman claiming she carried the groom’s child. Before the shock could settle, Briley—beloved by the screen and darling of millions—was being confronted by police officers, their tones grave as they accused her of masterminding a theft.
By tomorrow morning, every newspaper column and gossip blog would be ablaze with the ruins of this event.
And yet, at a table pushed to the far edge of the hall, Noah rose calmly and took Sadie’s hand in his.
Wordlessly, she stood beside him, matching his pace as they turned and began to walk away. Neither flinched. Neither looked back. It was as though the chaos belonged to an entirely different world.noveldrama
Just then, Briley’s gaze swept across the hall and landed on the departing pair. Something clicked. Recognition flared. Her face drained of color.
“Sadie!” she shrieked, her voice breaking into raw hysteria. “You planned this! You set me up!”
She lunged forward, desperate to tear through the officers holding her, but they were unyielding. She stood powerless, eyes locked on Sadie and Noah as they disappeared through the exit, never once sparing her a glance.
Ltеst chαpt?rs in glovs.
Briley’s shrieks echoed through the hall, her body writhing in protest, but the officers offered no mercy—hauling her out of the wedding hall.
Just then, Noah swiftly ushered Sadie out of the banquet hall and into the sleek vehicle waiting by the roadside.
Her expression shifted to one of mild confusion, her forehead creasing. “We’re just taking off like this?” she asked, still processing the chaos they’d left behind. The timing felt premature.
Noah tilted his head slightly, a faint smirk forming as he leaned closer. His breath ghosted past her ear, and a warm flush crept up her neck.
“Still want to see the show?” he murmured.
A charged pause followed, tension crackling in the confined space. Sadie’s face grew warmer, and she instinctively pushed Noah back, a little too abruptly. He went along with it, reclining against the seat with an amused air.
Clearing her throat, she struggled to regain her composure.
.

###Chapter 910:
“Briley’s still tied to the Wall name. If this mess explodes, it could smear the family.”
Despite her personal grudge, Sadie knew the family’s image came first.
Noah chuckled softly. “Relax. I already had Jack alert the authorities, claiming Briley had instigated others to steal.”
In this scenario, the disgrace would be Briley’s burden alone—leaving the Walls untouched.
Sadie froze for an instant. She glanced sideways at Noah.
He had already factored that in—navigating everything so precisely, ensuring minimal damage to the Wall family’s image.
Briley, frankly, was shockingly bold, making a move while she was mid-change? If she hadn’t had Samuel set up extra security around the lounge, things could have gone sideways fast.
Suddenly, a realization sparked in her mind. She turned slowly toward Noah, composed and alert, her expression unreadable. Her stare lingered, cool and penetrating.
“Curious,” she murmured. “What brought you to the lounge just then?”
Noah locked eyes with her, the corners of his mouth twitching upward. He leaned in, his voice light and tinged with teasing amusement.
“Maybe we’re just cosmically synced? I happened to stroll by and heard someone crying out. Naturally, I stepped in and saved the day.” He paused, lowering his voice, his breath brushing her ear like silk. “So, Ms. Hudson, any plans on repaying your knight in shining armor? Perhaps by becoming my—”
Before he could finish, Sadie, no longer willing to tolerate his antics, clapped her hand over his mouth. The heat of his lips against her palm sent an involuntary shiver through her fingers.noveldrama
   ?ν﹒
She quickly withdrew her hand, her face tightening, and addressed the chauffeur curtly. “Drive.”
Without question, the vehicle glided forward.
Noticing the flush creeping up her neck, Noah decided to cut her some slack. He adjusted his cuffs with deliberate calm, then remarked in a smooth, steady cadence, “With Yvonne’s public outburst today, both Rodger and Jarrett are in for quite the headache.”
Jarrett’s love affair and the revelation of a secret child were sure to ignite a media storm. Rodger, struggling to shield the Higgins name and pacify the Johnsons, would be stretched thin trying to contain the fallout.
“Meanwhile, Nathan could seize the moment to consolidate his hold over Higgins Group.” While Rodger and Jarrett were busy dealing with the scandal, Nathan would quietly reap the benefits.
The dominoes were falling just as forecasted.
Then Noah’s tone deepened, and his expression turned solemn. “When do you plan to break off your engagement with Nathan?” He’d been holding that question back for quite some time.
.

###Chapter 911:
Sadie blinked, momentarily caught off guard. She locked eyes with him, and an impish glint flickered in her gaze. With deliberate mischief, she let a smirk form.
“Nathan? Honestly, he’s not half bad. Handsome, and kind. About our arrangement…” she drawled, drawing out each word languidly. “I’m starting to reconsider whether I even want to end it.”
Unbeknownst to her, back at the Magnolia Grand banquet hall, Nathan—watching the chaos unfold in the corner—suddenly felt a strange chill crawling over his skin. He rubbed his arms, unsettled.
Weird. Was the air conditioning set too low in here?
Back in the car, Noah’s grin lingered, but his gaze turned icy. The atmosphere thickened.noveldrama
He stayed perfectly still.
“That’s alright. Nathan’s got charm, sure—he’s easy on the eyes. But…”
He paused, his smile sharpening.
“Let’s just say… his lifespan might be shorter than expected.”
Sadie’s smile froze for a split second.
She knew Noah was serious—she could hear the subtle threat in his words.
She quickly composed herself, stamping out the strange flutter in her chest.
Meeting his gaze without flinching, she replied, “This is Beversea, after all. The Higgins family has deep roots here, stretching back generations. They’re not the sort of people you can trifle with. You’re a visitor, Mr. Noel. You’d better not act rashly.”
She paused, her tone even sharper. “Otherwise, your life might be shorter than Nathan’s.”
?  ? ﹒
Noah studied her feigned bravado, and the chill in his eyes softened into a knowing smile.
He said nothing further, but his deep, intent gaze remained fixed on her.
At that moment, the car pulled to a stop.
The driver, tense and wary, sensed the heavy atmosphere and barely dared to breathe. After a few moments of silence, he risked a glance at the rearview mirror. “Mr. Noel, Ms. Hudson, we’re here,” he announced quietly.
His words were a welcome release for Sadie.
She wasted no time, pushing the car door open and stepping out without a backward glance.
She had barely regained her balance when a small figure barreled into her legs, clinging tightly.
“Mom!” Averi squealed.
A rush of warmth bloomed in Sadie’s chest. She bent down, ready to scoop her son into her arms—but the sharp-eyed boy caught sight of another figure emerging from the car.
.
.

###Chapter 912:
Noah, still masked, stepped into view.
Averi’s eyes widened with surprise and delight.
Without hesitation, he released his mother and bounded eagerly around the car, launching himself straight into Noah’s arms.
“Mr. Noel!” Averi’s voice trembled with joy. Noah caught him easily, lifting him up as a genuine smile spread beneath his mask.
Averi seemed heavier than the last time they’d met. Noah gently bounced the little boy in his arms. “You’ve gotten heavier, Averi.”
Averi wrapped his arms around Noah’s neck and nestled into his shoulder. Then he pulled back, gazing up at Noah with wide, sparkling eyes. “Will you play with me?”
Noah melted at the sight of that adorable face. He agreed without hesitation. “Of course.”
He glanced down the street, catching sight of a new amusement park near the hotel. “I heard there’s a newly-built amusement park nearby. Would you like to check it out with me, Averi?”
“Amusement park?” Averi echoed, his eyes shining with excitement. His cheeks flushed as he clapped his hands. “Yes, please! I want to go to the amusement park!”
He turned to Sadie, lips pursed in hopeful anticipation. “Mom, you should come with us! Please, Mom?”
Sadie saw her son’s pleading expression and felt her resolve melt. She could never bear to disappoint him. With a soft, resigned sigh, she nodded. “All right.”
“Yay! Mom, you’re the best!” Averi kicked his feet in excitement, leaning back into Noah’s embrace. The three of them climbed back into the car.
With Averi there, the mood lightened considerably. Even the driver relaxed, grateful for the newfound peace in the car.
  : ?ν?
When they arrived at the park, Averi could hardly contain himself. He hopped out and grabbed Noah’s hand, dragging him eagerly through the entrance.
For once, Noah let go of his usual reserve, patiently indulging the little boy’s every whim. The carousel, bumper cars, the little train—Averi dashed from ride to ride, laughter echoing in his wake.
Sadie followed a short distance behind, her phone ready to capture every rare moment of joy and warmth.
Noah held Averi, the boy’s laughter ringing out like a bell in spring—bright, clear, and infectious. Sadie couldn’t help but smile radiantly as she watched them together. To any passerby, they looked like a perfect, happy family of three.
None of them noticed the man standing beneath a large tree nearby, his cap pulled low to conceal his face. A professional camera hung in his hands. Click. Click.
After snapping several shots, the man swiftly packed up his equipment and made his way to a quiet corner of the park. With efficient movements, he transferred the photos to his phone, carefully selected the best ones, and sent them off.

###Chapter 913:
Miles away, in a villa on the outskirts of Jazmah, Hailey stared at the incoming photos on her screen. There was Noah, unmistakable even behind his mask, holding a child and clearly smiling. And right next to him was that woman—Sadie—her expression smug and content.
Together, they looked just like any ordinary family, enjoying a carefree day at the amusement park.
A wave of pure rage surged through Hailey. She trembled, her face darkening, hands clenched so tightly her knuckles turned white.noveldrama
Crack.
She hurled her phone against the marble floor, shattering the screen into jagged shards.
How dare Sadie? And Noah, too! After everything, after she’d saved his life—after three years by his side, after dragging him back from the brink—this was how he repaid her? Had he already forgotten who had stood by him when he was at his lowest?
Now he was off with that woman and her brat, parading around as if they were a perfect family.
Hailey’s chest rose and fell with each furious breath. And then the thought of Briley hit her. Sadie was alive and well—clearly, Briley had failed again. That foolish girl had never once succeeded at anything Hailey asked of her. All she ever did was make matters worse.
Grinding her teeth, Hailey paced the room, mind racing with toxic possibilities. She couldn’t—she wouldn’t—lose Noah. Not to Sadie, not to anyone.
She forced herself to stop. A chilling idea struck, sudden and sharp. She knelt, yanking open the bottom drawer of the coffee table. Inside, nestled in the shadows, lay a black handgun.
Keep reading at g?ν?co
It was the same weapon she’d used to kill Sutton.
Her last trump card.
Hailey stared at the gun, her face growing grimmer by the second. If Noah kept seeing Sadie, he would have no one to blame but himself for what was coming next. This time, Hailey was ready to go to any length. She had no choice left.
Suddenly, hurried footsteps echoed from the hallway. The butler burst in, panic etched across his features. “Ms. Burgess, bad news!”
Startled by his entrance, Hailey tried to slam the drawer shut, but the butler had already seen too much. She quickly composed herself, her voice cold and sharp. “What is it? Why are you so worked up?”
The butler struggled to catch his breath, his face pale. “Ms. Burgess, news from Beversea—Briley was arrested by the police. She was caught coercing someone to steal at Jarrett’s wedding. And that’s not all! Jarrett’s ex-girlfriend—Yvonne, I believe—she showed up at the ceremony, heavily pregnant. She claimed Jarrett is the father! The whole event turned into a spectacle. The alliance between the Higgins and Johnson families is ruined. It’s a total disaster!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 914:noveldrama
Hailey didn’t even flinch at the news. Briley had only herself to blame for getting caught and deserved whatever consequences awaited her. As for the chaos at the Higgins wedding, she hadn’t expected that family’s secrets to explode so publicly. A pregnant ex-girlfriend showing up in front of everyone? It must have been quite the scene.
A slow, cunning smile curled Hailey’s lips.
Meanwhile, back at the Higgins family estate, the air was thick with tension. Rodger, Jarrett, Daren, and Ophelia sat scattered across the sofas, none of them willing to break the silence. The pressure in the room was almost suffocating.
Finally, Daren snapped, slamming his hand against the armrest. “Rodger, after everything that happened today, your family owes us an explanation!”
His voice was hard, heavy with accusation. “My sister was publicly humiliated. How are we supposed to show our faces in Beversea after this scandal?”
He wasn’t wrong to be furious. Ophelia, the cherished princess of the Johnson family, had been disgraced on what should have been the happiest day of her life.
Ophelia had been utterly upstaged by a woman she didn’t even know. And to make matters worse, that woman had claimed to be carrying the groom’s child.
There were no words for the humiliation that both Ophelia and her family endured.
Rodger immediately mustered the most conciliatory smile he could manage. “Daren, please, let’s all try to calm down,” he pleaded, adopting a humble tone. “Let’s not get carried away.”
He stood up and personally refilled Daren’s coffee cup. “This is entirely our responsibility. We truly had no idea this would happen. I promise, we won’t let Ophelia suffer this injustice without taking action.” Despite his calm demeanor, Rodger was seething inside.
Yvonne had chosen the worst possible time to stir up trouble. What miserable luck. Still, his priority was to keep Daren and Ophelia from escalating the situation further.
Daren gave a derisive snort, picking up his cup but refusing to drink from it—a clear gesture of dissatisfaction. “You’d better mean what you say, Rodger,” he replied, his voice dripping with skepticism.
It was obvious he had little faith in any vague assurances.
Throughout the tense exchange, Jarrett remained silent, his eyes lowered and his expression clouded. He was still struggling to process the news about Yvonne’s pregnancy. The revelation had blindsided him as much as anyone else. When could it have possibly happened? He truly had no idea.
Just then, footsteps echoed from the hall as the family doctor descended the staircase, a report in hand. He approached Rodger and offered a small, respectful bow.
“Mr. Higgins,” the doctor said, his tone calm and professional. “Based on the test results, Miss Bryant is indeed pregnant. She is about five months along, and the baby’s condition is currently stable.”
All the color drained from Ophelia’s face at the news.

###Chapter 915:
By contrast, there was a fleeting spark of hope in Rodger’s eyes. Five months!
Rodger’s heart leapt when he realized he was about to have a grandchild. Despite Yvonne’s humble background, the child she carried was Jarrett’s firstborn—an heir whose existence would carry tremendous weight within the Higgins family.
Joy flickered in Rodger’s eyes, but he quickly mastered his expression and returned to a composed, dignified manner. Turning to the doctor, his voice was measured and calm. “Thank you. For now, see that Yvonne receives the best care possible. Nothing can be allowed to go wrong.”
His mind was already racing with possibilities. This child had to be protected at all costs.
Jarrett looked up then, his gaze cool and inscrutable as it settled on the doctor. Without a word, he gave a subtle signal to a nearby servant. The servant immediately stepped forward and began pushing Jarrett’s wheelchair up the stairs in silence.
He needed to see the situation for himself.
Meanwhile, Ophelia sat in the corner, overlooked and seething with resentment. Her fists were clenched so tightly that her knuckles turned white.
How had things come to this?
She was the precious daughter of the Johnson family, and she had already compromised by agreeing to marry Jarrett despite his disability. That alone had been a bitter pill to swallow. Now, an ex-lover had appeared, pregnant, and—worse yet—the Higgins family hardly seemed to mind. In fact, Rodger looked almost pleased.
Where did that leave her?
The injustice and humiliation burned within her, and tears welled up in her eyes. Only then did Rodger finally notice her expression.

He quickly buried his earlier excitement and softened his tone. “Ophelia,” he said gently, “you mustn’t worry. Yvonne may be carrying Jarrett’s child, but she holds no true status here. She will never stand among us as my daughter-in-law. Jarrett’s wife can only be you.”
He spoke with unwavering conviction. “But she is carrying a child, and we can’t treat her too harshly. My plan is this: once she gives birth, we’ll compensate her and quietly send her away. The child will remain with us and be recognized as your own. Publicly, we’ll present the child as an adopted heir of the Higgins family. That way, your status remains secure, and the child stays within our lineage.”
He paused, letting the weight of his words settle before offering his final bargaining chip.
“As a gesture of goodwill—and an apology—we’re prepared to share half the profits from the Wall Group’s projects with your family.”
Daren, who had been sulking just moments ago, immediately perked up at the offer.
The Wall Group’s projects—coveted by Beversea’s most powerful families—were an opportunity few could hope for. To be offered a share was no small matter.

###Chapter 916:
Ophelia’s personal grievances paled in comparison to such immense leverage. Daren’s frown gave way to a broad smile.
“Rodger, that’s more than generous. If this is your decision, you have our full trust and support.” He didn’t spare his sister so much as a glance.
Ophelia stared at him in disbelief, her world tipping off its axis.
Her brother had agreed—just like that?
Was she really expected to marry a disabled man and raise another woman’s child, all in exchange for a business deal?
What did that make her? Nothing more than a pawn, sacrificed for the family’s ambitions.
She shot to her feet, emotion threatening to spill over.
“I can’t—”
But Daren’s grip tightened on her arm, his voice urgent and low.
“Ophelia,” he said, eyes hardening with resolve. “Don’t be stubborn. This isn’t about your feelings. It’s about our family’s legacy. If you go through with this union, our status in Beversea will rise higher than ever. And you’ll still be Jarrett’s rightful wife.”
He leaned in, his voice coaxing and persuasive. “Just imagine it. With the power of both families combined, you’ll become the crown jewel of Beversea’s elite. Men will compete for just a glance from you.”
Ophelia’s chest tightened.
Unbidden, an image of Nathan’s easy, carefree smile drifted through her mind.
If she truly stood at the very top of Beversea’s social ladder—admired, envied—would Nathan finally care? Would he turn his gaze from that viper Sadie and see her instead?
  ? .
Her trembling slowly eased, the resistance draining from her body.
Daren noticed the shift and let out a quiet sigh of relief. He gave her hand a gentle tap, his tone softening. “Good. Stay here for now and settle in. I have business at the company, so I’ll be heading out.”
He adjusted his jacket and left the Higgins estate without looking back.
A hollow ache crept through Ophelia, quickly chased by a surge of fresh frustration.
She swept her gaze across the lavish room before turning sharply to the butler.
“Where’s Nathan? Why isn’t he here?”noveldrama
The butler blinked, a hint of surprise flickering across his face before he responded politely, “Miss Johnson, Mr. Higgins… I believe he went to the Emerald Hotel.”
Ophelia’s stomach dropped. That was where Sadie was staying.
Her expression darkened.
Nathan. He had run off to see her again. That woman even had a child who wasn’t his!
Why?

###Chapter 917:
What did Sadie have that she didn’t?
Meanwhile, Sadie, Averi, and Noah spent the entire afternoon out and about, enjoying the day’s calm and only returning after darkness had blanketed the city.
The little one, long worn out from the excitement, was now peacefully dozing in Noah’s embrace.
As the elevator opened with a soft chime, a lone figure crouched near Sadie’s door caught their attention.
It was Nathan.
He looked slightly aggrieved, his wide, pleading eyes fixed on them, resembling a loyal dog patiently waiting for its owner to return home.
Who knew how long he had been there?
Sadie stopped in her tracks, surprise flashing briefly across her face. Why was he here now?
Nathan rose slowly, smoothing his rumpled trousers, and offered a pouty, disgruntled look.
“You’re finally back,” he muttered. His legs were going numb from squatting like that for so long.
How could they have been off enjoying the day without a care?
Sadie quickly regained her usual composure.
“Let’s speak inside,” she said, reaching for her key card.
But Noah stepped forward and said in a steady, low voice, “We’ll use my suite.”
He moved in front of Sadie, still cradling Averi in his arms.
 ?   ?: ν
“It’s more spacious.”
As he spoke, he sent Nathan a sharp, silent signal. Nathan’s presence always got under his skin.
With just one look, Nathan felt a cold shiver run down his spine.noveldrama
He instinctively stepped back, not daring to .
“Of course! Mr. Noel’s place is far more comfortable!” Nathan blurted out, forcing an overly bright grin.
He found Patrick’s reaction wildly excessive. He had only come to report the situation to Sadie—why did that warrant a glare fit for a mortal enemy?
The man was downright menacing. Staying in his favor seemed like the only sane choice.
Sadie didn’t utter another word.
The trio made their way to Noah’s lavish suite.
Carrying Averi, Noah went into the bedroom, gently settled the boy onto the bed, and tucked the covers around him before rejoining the others in the living room.
.

.
###Chapter 918:
Sadie and Nathan were already seated on the sofa.
Feeling his throat dry as sand, Nathan grabbed the water pitcher on the coffee table and, bypassing the need for a cup entirely, guzzled several mouthfuls straight from it.
After several hearty gulps, he let out a thunderous burp and sighed, content. Setting the pitcher down, he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and seemed to recall his original purpose.
“You guys missed one hell of a scene,” he announced, eyes gleaming with wicked amusement.
“Yvonne stormed the stage, crying her eyes out like the world was ending, and flat-out refused to leave. The whole ceremony went down in flames. The Johnsons were livid, and I guarantee my old man must be racking his brains trying to fix the fallout.”
He recounted the chaos like a storyteller savoring every detail, but as he spoke, his grin slowly gave way to a furrowed brow.
“But I don’t understand why Briley got arrested,” he said, confused. “The police said she hired someone to steal. She’s always been spoiled, walking around like royalty, but that? Could she really go that far?”
Nathan shook his head in disbelief, clearly struggling to make sense of it.
Sadie picked up her drink and took a quiet sip.
Her eyes flicked to Noah beside her, who remained stone-faced.
“She wasn’t after valuables,” she said softly. “She tried to kill me while I was getting changed.”
Nathan reeled.
“Wait, what?” He bolted upright, face pale with alarm. He hurried to her side, eyes scanning her as if expecting to see blood.noveldrama
?  ? : ν?
“Are you okay?” His voice cracked under the weight of panic.
Good Lord. Briley had actually attempted murder?
Sadie was now his anchor. If something ever happened to her, everything he’d worked toward would unravel in an instant. That simply couldn’t be allowed.
Panic surged through Nathan as he instinctively reached out, desperate to confirm she was unharmed.
But just as his fingers hovered near the hem of her sleeve, a firm grip halted him mid-motion.
It was Noah.
No one had noticed when he stood, but now he was in front of Sadie, his gaze glinting cold and unreadable behind the mask.
Nathan stiffened. His instincts screamed at him to back off.
Without hesitation, he lifted his palms in surrender, a strained chuckle escaping.
“Alright, alright!” he blurted. “Relax, sir—I was only checking in on Ms. Hudson!”
Backing away with cautious steps, he dropped onto the sofa once more, his lips twitching in silent complaint.
.
.
.
###Chapter 919:
Really? Even brushing against Sadie was a problem now? Patrick’s possessiveness flared up like wildfire.
Noah turned away at last, reclaiming his seat beside Sadie.
When he spoke, his tone remained composed and unreadable.
“Is there anything else, Mr. Higgins?”
The intent was unmistakable—Nathan was being told to leave.
He had more to ask, but the intensity in Noah’s stare made him abandon the thought. Staying alive mattered more than satisfying curiosity.
He rose, forcing a polite grin.
“Nope, that’s everything. Just came by to fill Ms. Hudson in on what happened during the ceremony.”
“Since Ms. Hudson is fine, I’ll leave you two to get some rest. I still have some things to deal with anyway, so I’ll see myself out.”
Even as he spoke, Nathan was already darting toward the door as though the devil himself was on his heels.
Just as he grabbed the doorknob, however, he suddenly recalled something. He paused and looked back with a troubled expression.
“Actually, Ms. Hudson…” Nathan scratched the back of his head, his tone caught between urgent and sheepish. “I might need to trouble you again tomorrow—to accompany me to Higgins Manor.”
In light of the scandal that had exploded during Jarrett’s wedding, Rodger was no doubt struggling to clean up the mess.
This was the perfect opportunity for Nathan. If he managed to win over the elders and gain their support, taking Jarrett down and seizing control of the Higgins Group would be within reach.
g0ν.; ? 
And Sadie was his main bargaining chip—the very key he needed to pull this off. He had to take her with him.
Sadie didn’t even bat an eye.
“All right,” she said with a small nod, her tone calm.
Nathan looked visibly relieved by her response.
“That’s great! Thank you so much, Ms. Hudson!”
After expressing his gratitude, he pulled the door open and was gone in a flash.
As soon as the door clicked closed, Noah turned to look at Sadie. There was an impertinent glint in his gaze as he said,noveldrama
“It’s getting late. Will you consider staying here tonight?”
Sadie shot him a warning look. She had had enough of his presumptuous attitude.
“Thank you for keeping Averi company, Mr. Noel. I’m heading back now. I’ll pick him up tomorrow.”
.

.
###Chapter 920:
She stood up and walked to the door without waiting for his reply.
Noah was unfazed. If anything, a faint smile tugged at the corners of his lips.
He sauntered behind her, escorting her all the way to the door of the next room.
Sadie took out her key card and pressed it against the security sensor.
Beep!
Nothing happened. The lock light stayed red.
Frowning, she tried again. Still nothing.noveldrama
Seriously? Was the hotel service really this bad?
Noah leaned against the wall beside the door. His words conveyed surprise, but his tone made it clear he had expected this.
“How unfortunate. It looks like your door is broken.”
He cocked his head toward his room, adding,
“Ms. Hudson, perhaps you should—”
Sadie cut him off with a glare.
This wasn’t a coincidence at all. The jerk was up to something again.
She tucked her key card away and stormed over to the elevator.
“I’m staying with Tina tonight. I’ll call the front desk in the morning to have it fixed.”
Surely, he couldn’t have tampered with every single door in the hotel.
Noah didn’t try to stop her. He didn’t even straighten up. He just crossed his arms over his chest and watched her go.
“Suit yourself, Ms. Hudson.”

His tone was magnanimous—suspiciously so.
Sadie felt a ripple of unease in her chest. She knew better than anyone that Noah would never let her off so easily.
Even so, she steeled herself and pressed the button to close the elevator doors.
The moment she was gone, Noah held up his left arm and stared at his watch.
After exactly five minutes—
Ding!
The elevator doors opened again, and out walked Sadie, her face a mask of irritation.
She looked at the man still lounging by the wall, torn between anger and resignation.
What rotten luck. Tina’s door wouldn’t open either. Worse still, her phone was off, so Sadie couldn’t reach her.
Sadie approached Noah, her steps heavy with resentment.
“Well then…” She refused to look at his face. “I may have to stay in your suite after all. Is that okay? Tina’s not in her room.”

###Chapter 921:
Noah’s smile widened, and his eyes gleamed with thinly veiled satisfaction.
“Yes, of course.”
He pushed himself off the wall in one quick motion, appearing almost too eager to step aside and let Sadie back into his suite.
After ushering her in, Noah glanced toward a dark corner at the end of the hallway. Then he stepped into the suite as well and closed the door firmly behind him.
Tina and Jack let out a collective sigh of relief as they emerged from the shadowy spot.
They exchanged a brief glance of apprehension.
Jack was still clutching a small wrench.
They had cut it too close—Sadie had almost caught them. Luckily, he had managed to break the lock on Tina’s door just as Sadie entered the elevator.
Beside him, Tina patted her chest, her heart still pounding in her ears.noveldrama
“Do you think we’re doing the right thing?” she asked Jack, her voice hushed, her face lined with concern.
If Sadie found out what they had done, she would certainly be furious with her.
Jack shoved the wrench into the back pocket of his trousers and flashed her a carefree smile.
“Relax. Didn’t you notice how flawlessly Ms. Hudson and Mr. Noel complement each other?”
Tina paused, caught off guard for a moment.
The image of Sadie and Patrick together flashed through her mind—her refined grace beside his composed presence.

They really did seem like they belonged together.
Jack noticed the faraway look in her eyes and let out a soft laugh.
“Go catch some sleep. I’ve arranged for you to stay in another room downstairs.”
Tina gave a small nod, her thoughts already drifting elsewhere.
Meanwhile, in Noah’s presidential suite, Sadie took a slow tour of the elegant space.
Beside the main sleeping quarters, there was a more modest room tucked next to it.
She turned her gaze toward Noah.
“Averi and I will use the bigger bedroom tonight. I hope the smaller one’s okay for you,” she said, careful not to get too close.
Noah blinked in mild disbelief. That wasn’t what he had anticipated at all.
Just then, the bigger bedroom door groaned open.
Averi emerged sleepily, rubbing his eyes, clearly roused by the noise. He lingered by the entrance, groggy and confused, his gaze drifting toward the two adults seated in the living room.
“Mr. Noel? Mom? Why are you both still up?” Averi murmured sleepily.
.
.
.
###Chapter 922:
Unshod and swaying, he padded forward and clung to Noah’s leg, resting his cheek against the fabric of his trousers, barely awake. Then, he tilted his head upward, his half-lidded eyes blinking slowly.
“Mr. Noel… Mom… can we all sleep together tonight?”
Sadie stiffened, her expression unreadable. Sharing a bed with Noah? That was unthinkable. She opened her mouth to protest.
But Averi let out a deep yawn. His lower lip trembled, and his words carried a fragile sadness.
“All my friends at school say their moms and dads sleep with them at night,” he whimpered.
His soft, innocent voice tugged hard at Sadie’s heart, and a pang of guilt washed over her.
Averi had never known what it was like to have a father around. And she—always caught up in obligations—had barely given him the love and closeness he needed. Even the comfort of her presence during the night had become a rare privilege.
She knelt and pulled him close into her arms.
“Alright,” she whispered. “Whatever makes you happy, sweetheart.”
Noah remained a few steps away, observing the moment in silence, quietly impressed by Averi’s impeccable sense of timing.
This tiny ally of his had earned himself double dessert tomorrow—no arguments.
Sadie carried her son to the larger bedroom, with Noah trailing silently behind.noveldrama
They each freshened up quickly. When they returned, Averi had already claimed the center of the mattress, fighting off sleep.

Sadie settled on his left, while Noah naturally took the other side. The child lay nestled safely between them.
Exhausted after a long, draining day, Sadie succumbed to slumber in mere moments.
Noah turned to face them, an unfamiliar warmth blooming in his chest.
He reached over and gently pulled the covers up around them.
Only the quiet rhythm of breathing filled the space.
Eventually, he shut his eyes, surrendering to rest.
Meanwhile, Briley was having a hard time inside an interrogation room at the police station.
Her voice tore through the air, shrill and defiant.
“I’m from the Wall family! You honestly think I’d stoop to petty theft? This is absurd! The Higgins and Johnson families? Who do they think they are? Please—like I’d ever degrade myself by taking anything from them!”
Gone was the graceful persona adored by the media. In her place stood a furious whirlwind, shrieking with unbridled rage.

###Chapter 923:
Officers walked past the glass with barely a glance in her direction, uninterested in her tirade.
Her frustration intensified. She struck the metal table with her hand, the jolt sending tingles up her arm.
“Is anyone paying attention? I want my agent! Get my agent! Get my attorney!”
Her throat burned from the relentless screaming.
At that exact moment, the interrogation room door swung open.
Leonard stepped inside, wearing a calm, practiced grin.
“Briley, sorry you had to endure this mess,” he said softly. “You’re free to leave. I’ve covered your release.”
Before he could say more, Briley launched a sharp kick at his leg.
“Worthless! Where the hell have you been? What have you been doing?”
Leonard didn’t flinch, though pain shot up his calf. He maintained the grin and gave a respectful nod.
“Forgive me. There was a jam on the way, and I had to coordinate with someone about the media circus outside. Took longer than expected.”
Internally, he was scoffing. Coordinate? More like fuel the drama.
But Briley wasn’t paying attention anymore. She brushed past him with a glare.
“Whatever. Let’s get the hell out of this dump.”
She marched ahead, eager to flee the suffocating station.
Leonard followed close behind, lowering his voice.

“There’s a press crowd waiting. Be careful with your statements.”noveldrama
Without pausing, Briley pulled out a compact mirror and freshened her lipstick mid-stride.
She didn’t spare him a glance.
“Please. Don’t lecture me on how to face reporters.”
Leonard shut up immediately.
If she thought she had everything under control, he’d let her take the fall. This was merely the opening act.
Briley polished her perfect media smile—meticulously honed after endless practice—and pushed through the building’s front door.
Just as anticipated, a chaotic wall of reporters swarmed in, cameras and microphones pointed right at her.
Flashbulbs, flashing in rapid succession, lit up the night like fireworks.
Briley remained composed, offering a graceful nod.
“Thank you for your concern. I have done nothing wrong. There has clearly been a misunderstanding—someone is trying to frame me. I trust law enforcement will—”
.
.
.
###Chapter 924:
“Uncover the truth and clear my reputation.”
Her replies flowed smoothly, calculated and airtight. She was fully prepared for questions about the theft.
To her astonishment, the first reporter who approached, holding out a recorder, posed a question she hadn’t anticipated in the slightest.
“Miss Wall, there are allegations claiming you avoided every risky scene by relying solely on body doubles. Some even accuse you of attacking members of the production team. Are they true?”
Briley’s grin faltered. She blinked, unsure if she’d heard correctly.
What on earth did that have to do with the investigation?
The media wasted no time pressing in.
“Can you confirm or deny the accusations, Miss Wall?”
“It’s said you behaved like royalty—arriving whenever you pleased and vanishing just as quickly.”
“Did you physically harm anyone during the shoot? What’s your response?”
A hot wave of fury shot through Briley, her cheeks burning bright red.
“Absolute garbage! None of it is true—it’s pure character assassination!”
The next morning, sunlight streamed through the gap in the curtains, bathing the room in a warm golden light.
Sadie’s eyes fluttered open as the haze of sleep lifted.
Beside her, one figure stretched tall and another small, both sleeping deeply with rhythmic breaths.
 ? ? g?ν
Noah’s usually sharp features had softened into serenity in his sleep.
Averi, curled up like a small cocoon, his lips forming a gentle pout, wore an expression of such innocence that it coaxed a smile from Sadie.noveldrama
The events of the previous day seemed almost like a dream.
She gently peeled back the blanket and eased out of bed, careful not to disturb Noah or Averi.
Then, suddenly, there was a knock at the door—firm and rhythmic.
Sadie paused briefly, then stepped silently onto the carpet, barefoot. She crossed the room and peered through the peephole.
It was Tina.
Opening the door, she noticed Tina avoiding eye contact.
Tina held a key card, her voice a whisper.
“Good morning, Sadie. They’ve fixed your room’s lock.”
Sadie accepted the key card with a nod, her face unreadable.
.

.
###Chapter 925:
Turning toward the living room, she asked nonchalantly,
“How’s Briley?”
Tina’s demeanor changed instantly, her eyes lighting up with mischief.
“You missed the excitement last night, Sadie! Briley left the police station and the reporters swarmed her. She just lost it, shoved them, and started yelling right there on the street. She’s the top trend on social media now. The headline? ‘Briley Snaps and Attacks Reporters.’ And the comments—let’s just say she’s not getting any sympathy.”
Sadie reached for a glass of water on the table, her hand pausing mid-air.
Really? Briley, always so concerned with her image, had snapped publicly? This was surprising.
“What exactly happened?”
Tina, energized by the gossip, dove into the story with vivid detail.
The reporters had cornered Briley with accusations of diva-like behavior, using body doubles, and even abusing staff members—hitting every nerve. No wonder she had snapped.
Sadie listened in silence, sipping her water slowly, her face revealing nothing.
She believed Briley had brought this upon herself. After having her way in the entertainment industry, spoiled by constant praise, Briley had become arrogant and impulsive. Now, with her reputation crumbling, the public was quick to turn against her.noveldrama
Sadie had never considered herself particularly merciful. Briley had attempted to ruin her more than once. By choosing not to retaliate, Sadie felt she had already extended more grace than Briley ever deserved.
“Leave her to it,” Sadie remarked calmly, placing her glass on the table. “She should handle the consequences alone.”
   : ν
Then, changing the subject, Sadie turned to Tina.
“By the way, could you watch Averi for me today? I have some business to attend to.”
“Absolutely, Sadie! Don’t worry, he’s in good hands,” Tina responded eagerly, her nod full of promise.
Sadie then returned to her room to freshen up.
After a quick shower, she dressed in a crisp white suit.
Grabbing her bag, she made her way directly to the hotel lobby.
Outside, a flashy yellow sports car awaited her arrival.
Nathan leaned against it, sporting a broad grin and radiating good cheer.
As soon as he saw her approaching, Nathan straightened and hurried over.
“Good morning, Ms. Hudson!”
He swung the passenger door open with a flourish.
.
.
.
###Chapter 926:
Sadie slid into the seat with elegance. Nathan shut the door behind her, then walked around to the driver’s side and climbed in.
The car glided smoothly away from the hotel.
Sadie caught Nathan’s eye, noticing his palpable excitement.
“So, what’s the plan once we arrive at Higgins Manor?”
Nathan adjusted his posture, his smile brimming with confidence.
“Ms. Hudson, just follow my lead. I’ve sent a team to gather information. The fiasco at yesterday’s wedding is dominating today’s news. My family’s reputation is tarnished, and the company’s stock price has plummeted by five percent. My father is likely overwhelmed with damage control—he won’t be thinking clearly. We’ll take this opportunity to catch Jarrett off guard.”
Sadie nodded subtly, then closed her eyes and reclined in her seat, seeking a moment of rest.
Yet, her thoughts wandered to Noah—his masked visage and the fleeting softness in his eyes as he cradled Averi.
Meanwhile, back at the hotel’s presidential suite, Noah stirred awake.
Instinctively, he reached out to pull Sadie closer.
However, his hand met only the cool, empty sheets where she had been.
He opened his eyes, and a shadow of annoyance crossed his face. She had truly gone—without a second thought.
Noah sat up and reached for the bathrobe on the nightstand, slipping it on before padding out of the bedroom.
He found Tina meticulously arranging a breakfast spread on the dining table. She paused when she saw him standing there and gave a polite greeting.
Your next story begins at . comnoveldrama
“Good morning, Mr. Noel.”
Noah took a seat and picked up the cup of coffee in front of him, sweeping a lazy gaze across the room.
“Where’s your boss?” he asked.
“Ms. Hudson left over an hour ago,” Tina replied. “She asked me to stay and look after Averi.”
Noah took a sip of coffee and let its rich, bitter taste spread across his tongue.
What an ungrateful woman. He had gone out of his way to take her in last night, and she couldn’t even offer a simple thank you before leaving?
Sadie had just used him and tossed him aside.
Noah’s internal grumbling was interrupted by the shrill ringtone of his phone. It was Forest.
Noah immediately frowned but still chose to take the call.
“Hello?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 927:
He was greeted by the older man’s jovial laughter.
“Noah! Feeling better now? I just returned to the country. It’s been ages since we last saw each other. Why don’t we have dinner tonight and catch up? We should celebrate Hailey’s pregnancy!”
That last sentence caused Noah’s grip to tighten around his coffee cup.
His expression turned stormy behind the mask, but he kept his voice cool and composed.
“I’m not in Jazmah at the moment. Let’s meet up some other time.”
There was a pause on the other end, and he imagined Forest’s surprise at the outright refusal.
Sure enough, when the older man spoke again, his tone was laced with a hint of frustration.
“Come on, Noah. That’s not like you at all. You know I didn’t fly all the way home just for dinner.”
He sighed before shifting gears and getting to his point.
“The company’s overseas branch has been unsteady lately. A bunch of old-timers are getting too ambitious for their own good. I returned to discuss this with you, and maybe glean some advice.”
Noah paused in the act of taking another sip of coffee, his expression darkening even further.
He had been aware of the brewing unrest within the Burgess Group, but he hadn’t expected things to escalate to the point that Forest would come back and personally seek his help.
Whatever this new problem was, it wasn’t just some minor hiccup.
Find it at g?aν?s.?
“Send me the address,” Noah finally said, his tone curt.
Forest let out a pleased chuckle.
“I knew you’d agree. I’ve booked a restaurant. I’m certain you’ll like the place. I’ll text you the details.”
Meanwhile, inside the meeting room of Higgins Manor, the family elders were gathered around a circular rosewood table, all of them stern-faced.noveldrama
“What are we supposed to do now? That idiot Jarrett has dragged our family name through the mud with his scandal! Just look at how much our stock prices have dropped! Our partners are all watching like hawks, ready to make a move as soon as something happens!”
This came from a particularly hot-headed elder, who slammed his palm against the table in anger.
“We have to get rid of that woman. What’s her name again? Yvonne? That whore has no shame, making a scene at such an important occasion!”
He was practically foaming at the mouth by the time he finished speaking.
What an utter disgrace.

###Chapter 928:
They had carefully arranged the marriage between the Higgins and Johnson families—they had gone to great lengths to reach a mutual agreement. And now, they had become the laughingstock of the country.
While the Johnson family might not carry as much weight in Beversea as the Higgins family, they were still an established powerhouse with deep ties to the local scene. It wouldn’t be wise to burn bridges with them.
Even so, they all knew the Johnson family would not stand for this humiliation—and rightly so.
Just then, the double doors swung open, and two figures walked in.
It was Nathan, his usual look of mischief surprisingly replaced by an unfamiliar, somber expression, and Sadie trailed behind him.
All conversations ceased instantly, and a heavy silence settled over the room.
Nathan cleared his throat and forced a smile. “Good morning, gentlemen,” he said with a slight bow. “With all due respect, I don’t believe pointing fingers and assigning blame will get us anywhere right now. I might actually have a solution that could help the Higgins family out of this mess.”
His words were met with skeptical, unimpressed frowns. Nathan was better known for his indulgence than his wisdom. What sort of solution could he possibly offer?
The elders had never taken him seriously, and they had no intention of starting now.
But when their eyes fell on the woman standing behind Nathan, their skepticism faltered.
This was Sadie Hudson, the current chairwoman of the Wall Group—a powerhouse whose influence far surpassed that of the Higgins family.noveldrama
Exchanging meaningful glances, the elders’ attitudes shifted in unison.
 ?  ? ? ν．
Alonzo Higgins rose and offered Sadie a courteous smile. “What an unexpected honor, Ms. Hudson! Had we known of your arrival, we would have prepared a proper welcome.”
His words were typical formalities exchanged among high society, but the unspoken question lingered—why had Sadie come with Nathan at such a critical moment?
Sadie inclined her head gracefully in acknowledgment, casting a brief sideways glance at Nathan before replying, “You’re too kind.”
“As Nathan’s fiancée, I am now part of the Higgins family. I’ve come today to discuss the recent plunge in the Higgins Group’s stock price.”
Sadie’s declaration prompted the elders to exchange uneasy glances, tension rippling through the air like a silent current.
Fiancée? Part of the Higgins family? Everyone present recognized this as mere sugarcoated nothingness. Someone like Sadie could never truly belong among the Higgins ranks—this remained an unspoken certainty.
The Wall Group and the Higgins Group operated in entirely different spheres of influence.
Only days before, the Wall Group had extended them several projects—an already generous gesture that bordered on charity.

###Chapter 929:
Now, amid scandal and financial freefall, Sadie had undoubtedly arrived to evaluate whether the Higgins family still merited any association. This fact hung unspoken yet perfectly understood by everyone present.
Alonzo broke the silence first. He stepped aside with practiced deference, motioning toward the seat of honor. “Ms. Hudson, please make yourself comfortable.”
Sadie accepted without a moment’s hesitation. She glided forward with elegant composure and claimed the most distinguished seat in the room. Her mere presence commanded attention, her quiet dignity asserting authority over everyone in attendance.
Only then did Alonzo pivot toward Nathan, his tone carefully probing. “Nathan, you mentioned having a solution earlier. Let’s hear your thoughts.”
Nathan squared his shoulders and straightened, his gaze deliberately sweeping across the assembled elders.noveldrama
“Gentlemen, our stock is plummeting and our reputation lies in shambles. This crisis stems directly from my elder brother Jarrett—his misconduct and moral failures have brought this catastrophe upon us. This hasn’t merely embarrassed the Johnson family—it has severely tarnished the legacy our Higgins family has meticulously built over generations. To reverse this downward spiral, stabilize our stock value, and reassure our anxious partners, we must first strip Jarrett of all substantive authority within the company. We must demonstrate to the world that…
The Higgins family holds itself accountable. Only through such decisive action can we hope to regain investor confidence and salvage our standing in the business community.”
The room plunged into stunned silence. The elders gaped at Nathan, astonishment etched across their weathered faces.

Could this truly be the same Nathan they had dismissed as immature and incompetent? When had such clarity of thought emerged in him?
Alonzo narrowed his eyes to slits, scrutinizing Nathan’s expression with newfound interest.
Since when had this coddled heir developed such incisive judgment? These words hardly resembled anything Nathan would conceive independently.
Detecting their skepticism, Nathan flashed a sheepish smile and absently scratched the nape of his neck.
“Actually, Sadie deserves credit for most of this strategy. She considered what would best serve the family’s interests and guided me through the reasoning. Honestly, I never would’ve developed such a plan independently.”
Understanding dawned across the elders’ faces. So this had been Sadie’s mastermind strategy all along—suddenly everything clicked into place.
If they stripped Jarrett of power, who would fill the resulting vacuum? The answer loomed obvious—Nathan, standing before them with newfound confidence. Sadie had positioned him to seize the reins.

###Chapter 930:
Nevertheless…
The elders exchanged wary glances, their reservations etched plainly across their furrowed brows.noveldrama
“What about Rodger?” one ventured. “He certainly won’t accept this transition gracefully.”
“Precisely. Rodger has always favored his elder son, Jarrett. When he discovers we’ve stripped Jarrett of power, we’ll face his considerable wrath.”
Sadie delicately lifted her coffee cup and stirred it with deliberate precision, her movements flowing with unhurried elegance.
She then raised her eyes, piercing the room with a gaze both glacial and unwavering.
“You represent the backbone of this family. Surely you can evaluate simple consequences. At this moment, the entire Higgins empire teeters precariously on…
The brink of collapse. Are you truly prepared to sacrifice everything to protect someone who’s physically compromised and already disgraced? Or will you embrace the difficult decision that guarantees your family’s survival? Ultimately, your choice distills to this: will you safeguard a century-old legacy, or gamble everything to shield one fallen man?”
Her words resonated like a hammer striking steel. The elders’ expressions transformed before her eyes.
She spoke undeniable truth. Would they truly jeopardize everything to shield one disgraced heir—while simultaneously alienating Sadie, who wielded the formidable power of the Wall Group?
The logical choice glared obvious. Abandon Jarrett. Rally behind Nathan. With the Wall Group’s backing, the Higgins dynasty stood a fighting chance to weather this devastating tempest.
gα?ησν?s?com is where your journey begins
Determination ignited in Alonzo’s weathered eyes. His decision crystallized in that moment.
He slammed his palm against the polished table with finality. “Ms. Hudson speaks absolute truth. We cannot permit one man’s failures to demolish everything the Higgins name represents!”
He pivoted toward Sadie, fixing her with a gaze both resolute and earnest.
“We stand prepared to support Nathan fully. And we trust that, as our families approach unification, the Wall Group will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us through this turbulent crisis.”
The ghost of a satisfied smile tugged at the corners of Sadie’s perfectly composed lips.
“Mr. Higgins, your clarity of purpose and commitment to preserving your family’s legacy genuinely commands my respect.”
“Naturally,” Alonzo responded with newfound confidence. “The Wall and Higgins dynasties shall soon become inseparable.”

###Chapter 931:
Sadie shifted her attention toward Nathan. “You undoubtedly have crucial matters requiring discussion. I’ll grant you privacy.” She gracefully rose from her seat.
“Please allow us to escort you, Ms. Hudson!” The elders hastily rose to their feet with newfound deference.
Nathan trailed after Sadie, barely able to contain the slight curve of his lips. He had done it. He had finally taken the first step toward seizing control of the Higgins Group.
Sadie walked straight to the car parked just at the entrance. She was reaching for the door handle when a figure suddenly darted from the side and blocked her path.
It was Ophelia. Her face was twisted in anger, and her eyes were bloodshot. Clearly, she hadn’t slept a wink last night.
Ophelia crossed her arms over her chest and lifted her chin in a challenge. “What do you think you’re doing here? This is Higgins Manor. This is no place for you.”
Sadie cocked her head to the side and raised an eyebrow.
She had never been one to waste her time on people who actively sought trouble. She reached for the door handle again.
Ophelia’s rage surged at being ignored. Sadie sure had some nerve, acting all arrogant in front of her!
Without warning, she grabbed Sadie’s wrist in a vice-like grip. “You really have no manners, do you, Ms. Hudson?” Ophelia flashed her a smile that looked fake. “As your future sister-in-law, the least you can do is acknowledge my presence!”noveldrama
Sadie paused and looked back at Ophelia.
So, this was her game. Ophelia was going to use this situation to try and assert dominance over her.
How laughable!
R f?m  ?t g?ν?
Sadie let out a sound that was a cross between a laugh and a scoff. “Oh? Sister-in-law?”
She looked Ophelia up and down before settling her gaze on the latter’s tight expression. “Then tell me, my dear sister-in-law—did you have a good time at your wedding?”
Her words cut Ophelia like a sword through the heart.
The wedding had been a disaster, her fiancé was revealed to have an illegitimate child, and she was now the laughingstock of Beversea.
How the hell could she have possibly had a good time?
All the color drained from Ophelia’s face. Sadie, the bitch! She just had to add more insult to injury.
“Damn you!” Ophelia trembled all over, no longer able to contain her rage.
She drew her arm back and raised her hand, intending to slap Sadie.
.
.
.
###Chapter 932:
But her palm never made contact.
Eyes flashing with a quiet fury of her own, Sadie moved at lightning speed. She caught Ophelia’s wrist mid-swing, gripping it so hard that Ophelia let out a gasp of pain.
Sadie used the momentum to fling Ophelia’s hand back, then she shoved Ophelia altogether.
Ophelia had the misfortune of wearing high heels at the moment, and she stumbled backward, completely losing her balance.
“Ah!” she yelped as she fell on the ground in a sorry heap, her palms scraping against the rough surface of the asphalt.
Ophelia blinked in disbelief. Had Sadie actually pushed her?
Ophelia jerked her head up to glare at Sadie. “How dare you lay a hand on me!”
Sadie stepped closer, closing the distance between them. She grabbed Ophelia by the jaw and forced her to meet her eyes.
Ophelia saw the unmistakable warning in her face. There was a ruthless glint in Sadie’s eyes that was absolutely terrifying.
And then Sadie spoke, her words slow and deliberate. “Clearly, you don’t really know who you’re dealing with, Ophelia. Perhaps you should ask around, find out what kind of person I really am.”
Her fingers tightened ever so slightly. Ophelia winced in pain, but didn’t dare to protest in any way.
“If you ever try something like this again—” Sadie leaned in, her voice barely a whisper when she continued, “Next time, it wouldn’t be just a fall. Who knows? Maybe… a broken leg?”
Ophelia froze, feeling her body go cold.
 ? at gν?.0m
Her mind immediately went to Jarrett’s ruined legs, and a shudder ran down her spine.
This woman before her was definitely not joking. Sadie meant every word, and she would see it through to the end.
Ophelia was shaking now, her face deathly pale, her eyes wide with fear.
Satisfied, Sadie gave her a faint smirk. Her goal had been achieved.
People like Ophelia would not respond to reason. They only recognized power, so one had to use fear to communicate with them.
Sadie released Ophelia and straightened up. She couldn’t be bothered to waste another second of her time or energy on her.
She opened the car door and got inside. The engine roared to life, and soon the black car was cruising out of Higgins Manor, disappearing into the road ahead.noveldrama
Ophelia remained slumped in the courtyard, still stunned by the encounter. It took a long while before she finally gathered her bearings and scrambled to her feet.
Her knees and palms stung. They were scraped raw!
That wretched woman! How dare Sadie treat her like this? Did Sadie think she was easily bullied?
.
.
.
###Chapter 933:
Well, she was about to show Sadie otherwise!
Sadie drove back to the Emerald Hotel.noveldrama
When she pulled over, she noticed that the sleek, black car was nowhere to be found.
Her brows furrowed.
As she walked down the hall, she found the door to Noah’s presidential suite wide open, and a couple of hotel staff were already tidying up the room.
Had Noah actually left just like that?
But Sadie chose not to dwell on it and walked straight into her own room. She was greeted by the sight of Tina sitting cross-legged on the carpet, working on a jigsaw puzzle with Averi.
They looked up at the sound of the door opening.
“Oh, you’re back,” Tina said. “Finished everything so soon?” She stood up and dusted her knees. “Should I arrange lunch now?”
Sadie walked over and gently ruffled her son’s hair. “Have you been good today, Averi?”
The little boy nodded earnestly, his eyes wide and sparkling. “I’ve been really good! I helped Tina with the puzzle!”
Sadie’s face broke into a warm smile. She straightened up and casually swept her gaze over the room.
“By the way,” she said to Tina, her tone nonchalant, “Noah let me stay at his suite last night, so it’s only right that I thank him for the favor. Can you check with him and see if he’s available for lunch?”
She had indeed used Noah’s room. The least she could do was treat him to a meal.
Full cont3nt h3re: glnovels.
Tina’s smile faltered, and she fidgeted with her hands.
“Well…” she began with obvious hesitation. “Mr. Noel… He left early this morning. I believe he was called back to Jazmah for something urgent.” She paused and studied Sadie’s reaction before asking, “He didn’t tell you?”
Sadie’s face froze for a split second, a pang of disappointment prickling her heart.
But she quickly composed herself and waved her hand dismissively. “Oh, I see. It’s no big deal. If he’s busy, then never mind.”
She turned her attention back to Averi, her smile softening. “Why don’t we grab some chicken wings and fries for lunch?”
The boy’s eyes immediately lit up, and he clapped his hands in excitement. “Yes! I would love that!”
Tina let out a small sigh of relief and nodded. “All right, then. I’ll go order it right away!” With that, she hurried off to make the call.
Sadie stroked Averi’s soft cheek one more time before walking to her bedroom. She closed the door behind her with a soft click, shutting out the rest of the world.
Only then did she allow a wave of exhaustion to wash over her.
.
.
.
###Chapter 934:
She reached up to knead her temples in hopes of easing some of the tension.
Had Noah rushed back to Jazmah because of Hailey? She was pregnant, after all.
No sooner had the thought crossed Sadie’s mind than she felt her heart twist inside her chest.
She quickly shook her head, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath. Then her lips curled into a wry smile.
Hailey was Noah’s wife now, and they were expecting a child. It was natural for him to be concerned about her welfare. What did any of that have to do with her?
As Sadie resigned herself to this thought, sleep began to take over.
Sadie let out a long yawn, her eyes stinging with sleepy tears.
She had just barely made up her mind to take a short nap when Tina called out from outside the bedroom. “Sadie, I’ve booked the car and the restaurant. We can head out whenever you’re ready.”
Sadie shook off her fatigue and patted her cheeks to perk herself up. “Got it! I’ll be right there.” She straightened her clothes and tidied up her hair, then opened the bedroom door.
At four o’clock that afternoon, a black car slipped into Jazmah and blended smoothly with the traffic.
Jack glanced at his watch, then at the rearview mirror to peek at the man in the back seat.
“Boss, should we head straight to Nirvana?”
Noah’s eyes were on the fleeting scenery outside. His only response was a brief hum of agreement.
A : ga l no v els .co m
The familiar face of a cool beauty always lingered at the back of his mind. How would Sadie react when she found out he was gone? Would she feel the slightest bit of disappointment to see him leave?
Noah chided himself. What was he thinking? That heartless woman was probably relieved to see him go. She had told him as much.
A flicker of self-derision appeared in his eyes.
Half an hour later, the car stopped in front of Nirvana.
Noah made his way to the third floor and stopped in front of Room 303.
The door swung open.
Forest and Hailey had already been waiting for some time, and their faces instantly brightened when they saw him.
Noah’s gaze, however, was cold as he surveyed them.noveldrama
He walked into the private room and took a seat without a word. All at once, the air grew thick and heavy with tension.
“You came all the way back from overseas, Mr. Burgess,” Noah began. “What’s going on with the company?” Neither his tone nor his expression betrayed any emotion.
.
.
.
###Chapter 935:
Forest’s smile stiffened at the question, and his eyes darted over to his daughter.
Hailey immediately caught on.
She picked up the coffee pot and walked over to Noah, pouring him coffee as she spoke in a soft, pandering voice. “You don’t have to be so formal with my father.”
“We’re family, after all.”
Hailey placed the coffee cup beside Noah, her fingers lingering near his arm with a tentative touch.
Noah edged away subtly, his face an impenetrable mask of indifference.
He lifted the coffee cup, rotating it methodically in his palm without bringing it to his lips.
“I recall, before my return from abroad, the people entrusted were more than capable of maintaining the branch company’s stability.” Though barely above a whisper, his voice carried unmistakable gravity. The accusation beneath his words was perfectly clear.
Had Forest not schemed in the shadows, the Burgess Group would have remained unshaken.
Forest’s smile flickered weakly, then vanished completely from his face.
He cleared his throat twice, desperately changing the subject. “Oh, Noah, be reasonable. I only intervened because I cared deeply, nothing more.”
He raised his utensils, gesturing toward the spread. “Come now, let’s not waste this meal with idle talk—sample these dishes. They’re absolutely exquisite.”
He hesitated, feigning sudden remembrance.
Full updat3z h3r3: glnoνels.
“By the way, Noah, I heard you and Hailey were considering holding your wedding ceremony here. I thought—perhaps the eighth of next month would serve as an ideal date. What’s your opinion?”
Noah’s fingers constricted almost invisibly around the porcelain cup, his knuckles whitening slightly.
So there it was. All this careful maneuvering—this represented their actual agenda. The business discussion had merely served as camouflage. Their genuine ive was to force him into marriage.
Noah placed the coffee cup down with a deliberate clink against the mahogany. When he raised his gaze, his eyes had transformed into arctic glaciers.
“Ms. Burgess is pregnant. She shouldn’t subject herself to unnecessary stress. Regarding the wedding—I believe we should abandon the idea entirely.”
The instant those words escaped his lips, Hailey’s smile evaporated like morning dew under harsh sunlight.
“Ms. Burgess?” Why this sudden formality? Never before had he referred to her with such cold detachment.noveldrama
A tsunami of dread crashed over her, stealing her breath away. Forest’s expression clouded ominously, a premonition of disaster swelling within his chest.
.
.
.
###Chapter 936:
He manufactured a laugh, brittle and hollow. “Noah, what exactly are you suggesting?”
Noah remained silent for a moment. His gaze locked onto Hailey, his voice unnervingly measured. “As it happens, there’s an important matter I need to address with both of you.”
Hailey was paralyzed, her blood turning to ice in her veins.
Forest’s discomfort intensified. He sculpted another rigid smile. “Indeed? And what is it you want to talk about? We’re listening intently.”
Noah reclined slightly in his chair. “I wish to discuss divorce with Ms. Burgess.”
His declaration struck like lightning, stunning the room into profound, disbelieving silence.
Hailey’s complexion drained to alabaster, her mind refusing to process his devastating words.noveldrama
But Noah continued speaking, seemingly oblivious to the emotional devastation he had just unleashed.
“Three years ago, when I lay critically ill in Zupren, Ms. Burgess nursed me back to health. I owe her my existence. To repay her compassion, and to help the struggling Burgess Group, I married her. Yet throughout these three years, no authentic love has blossomed between us. The Burgess Group now thrives independently. My obligation stands fulfilled.”
Hailey could restrain herself no longer. She leapt from her chair. “No! I refuse a divorce!” Tears cascaded down her flushed cheeks.
She lunged toward Noah, clutching his arm desperately with both hands. “Noah! Please—is this because of my pregnancy? Are you still angry with me?”
  ? ? ν
She mistakenly assumed his bitterness stemmed from the child not being his own.
“I’ll terminate the pregnancy! I’ll go to the hospital immediately! We can conceive together—a child you truly desire, alright? I’ll fulfill any demand. Just don’t abandon me! I beg you!”
She collapsed into uncontrollable sobs, her mascara-streaked face the portrait of absolute heartbreak and desperation.
Noah’s forehead creased deeply, his eyes reflecting nothing but cold contempt.
He thrust her away—with such force that she staggered backward, nearly losing her balance.
“Ms. Burgess, maintain some dignity.” Noah’s voice sliced through the air like a steel blade.
Forest, witnessing his daughter’s humiliation, finally snapped. He crashed his fist against the table and surged to his feet, silverware rattling from the impact.
“Noah! How dare you? Do you consider the Burgess family your playthings? My daughter isn’t some disposable asset you acquire and discard whenever you want!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 937:
Forest’s features contorted with rage, his stance shifting as though he was ready to physically defend his daughter’s honor.
Noah deliberately lifted his gaze, arctic contempt gleaming in his eyes. He released a soft, derisive chuckle that cut through the tension.noveldrama
“Mr. Burgess, has your memory truly failed you? These three years—do you imagine I remain ignorant of your family’s clandestine activities? Shall I enumerate each underhanded scheme you’ve orchestrated? If your family’s standing means so little to you, I would gladly assist in its complete demolition.”
Noah’s venomous threat crystallized the very atmosphere, leaving the room suspended in frigid terror.
Forest’s rage evaporated instantly, yielding to nauseating fear. He dropped his gaze to the floor, his lips parting to respond—yet he produced only silence.
Should those buried secrets ever surface, the Burgess dynasty would crumble to irreparable ruin.
Noah averted his gaze dismissively. “Following the divorce, I’ll guarantee your family receives the full amount stipulated in our prenuptial agreement. Regarding everything else—this concludes immediately.”
With that final pronouncement, he offered the father and daughter no further acknowledgment. He rose smoothly, pivoted on his heel, and strode purposefully toward the exit.
“Noah, please—don’t leave me!” Hailey’s broken plea echoed in the emptiness he left behind.
Hailey sprang up to chase after Noah, sobbing as she went. She was frantic, failing to notice a chair leg jutting into her path.
A dull thud rang out as she tripped and fell to the floor, completely losing her composure.
  ?: g?ν?.?
Her knee slammed against the cold, hard surface, sending a sharp, searing pain through her leg.
Noah didn’t even break his stride, let alone glance back at her.
Hailey’s hands balled into fists.
Sadie! It was all because of that wretched woman!
If Sadie hadn’t appeared in their lives, Noah would have never treated her this way! He would have never wanted a divorce!
No, she wasn’t going to give him up so easily. But even Evan—her only hope—had refused to help her. What was she supposed to do now? Forest was rooted to the spot, looking at his daughter sprawled on the floor while his face twisted in disdain.
“You’re utterly useless! You can’t even win a man’s heart! Now look at you! You’re about to lose everything!”
He closed his eyes and heaved a deep sigh, clearly fed up with the situation. Buttoning his suit jacket, he strode out of the private room without another word.
.
.
.
###Chapter 938:noveldrama
Hailey was left alone, still slumped on the floor, her fists clenched so tightly that her knuckles had turned white.
At this point, she knew she had no one else to rely on but herself. She needed to come up with a plan, a foolproof one, to get rid of Sadie, once and for all.
But she couldn’t do the deed herself. If Noah ever found out she was involved in Sadie’s demise, everything she had worked for would fall apart.
A glint appeared in Hailey’s eyes as a face emerged in her mind.
Briley. That worthless fool.
Her reputation had been tattered after her public outburst in front of the media, and even now, she was still a favorite subject of online ridicule.
It was the perfect opportunity—she would use Briley to deal with Sadie. All she had to do was fan the flames of Briley’s hatred toward Sadie, goading her until she reached her limit and completely lost control.
Hailey wiped the tears from her face and struggled to her feet.
She smoothed down her dress and grabbed her phone to make a call.
It connected after only a couple of rings.
“Hello?”
“Hire a bunch of people to trash Briley online. Tell them to make it look like Sadie is behind it. Make sure to leave a clear trail, do you understand? The uglier it gets, the better. I want Briley’s name to be destroyed for good.”
The man on the other end let out a sound of surprise. He obviously had no clue what Hailey wanted to do, but he didn’t dare to ask any questions.
“Understood, Ms. Burgess. I’ll take care of it right away.”
? : ν?
Hailey hung up, her lips curling into a cold, sinister smile.
If Briley discovered that she was being attacked by netizens under Sadie’s orders, it would make her loathe the latter even more.
Things would eventually escalate, and Hailey wouldn’t even have to do anything. She knew Briley would take matters into her own hands and exact revenge.
In Hailey’s mind, having someone else dirty their hands to achieve her goal was the smartest move.
“Let’s see how you get out of this one, Sadie,” Hailey muttered through gritted teeth.
Meanwhile, Noah’s face was blank as he walked out of the building and slid into the backseat of the black car waiting at the curb.
Sitting behind the wheel, Jack glanced at his boss through the rearview mirror and tried to gauge Noah’s mood.
The atmosphere was heavy, the pressure palpable.
“Where to next, boss? The Autumn Garden Villa is ready, just as you instructed.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 939:
Noah leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes.
Hailey’s tear-streaked face flashed through his mind and grated on his nerves.
He took a deep breath and nodded.
“Head over there, then.”
Jack said nothing more and started the engine.
At that same moment, at the Emerald Hotel in Beversea, Sadie was tossing and turning in bed, feeling an unusual sense of discomfort. Her drowsiness had barely let up during lunch, and she fell fast asleep after returning to the hotel. She had slept well into the evening. But instead of feeling refreshed upon waking up, Sadie felt as though she had been hit by a truck.
It was a strange experience. She had never felt like this before.noveldrama
Frowning, she sat up gingerly and slowly tried to stretch.
Just then, a knock came at the door.
“Sadie?” It was Tina.
Sadie got out of bed and went to open the door.
At the doorway, Tina appeared with a cup of warm water in hand.
She flicked on the light.
As soon as Sadie’s face came into view, drawn and weary, concern crept into Tina’s expression.
“You look pale, Sadie. Are you feeling alright? Do you need to see a doctor?”
Shaking her head, Sadie reached for the cup and took it from her. “No, I’m okay. Just a little worn out.”
R  ? ? gov.
She took a careful sip, the warmth soothing the dryness in her throat. “Is something wrong? You look like you’ve got news.”
Tina didn’t answer right away. Her lips pressed together for a moment before she finally said, “The chairman of Higgins Group… he asked to meet with you.”
The words made Sadie freeze, her hand pausing mid-air.
Jarrett? What could he want now? Was this connected to Nathan trying to seize power?
No surprise there—Jarrett showing up so quickly after the elders made their decision said everything about his sense of timing.
Clearly, the Higgins family’s internal conflict ran deeper than she’d thought. Still, she knew she couldn’t avoid it.
Rather than sit and dwell on it, she set the cup down on her nightstand and said, “Alright. Bring him to the sitting room. I’ll get changed and meet him there.”
Without hesitation, Tina gave a small nod. “Okay, Sadie.” She turned and slipped out of the room.
.
.
.
###Chapter 940:
A quiet breath escaped Sadie’s lips as weariness settled back over her shoulders.
Dealing with the Higgins family felt like dragging around a storm. If it weren’t for the trail leading to her parents, she wouldn’t have gotten involved in the first place.
She pulled on a cream cardigan, the soft fabric a small comfort, and made her way toward the sitting room.
Just as expected, Jarrett was already there. He sat motionless in his wheelchair, his expression impossible to read.
The moment Sadie walked in, a faint smile tugged at Jarrett’s mouth. Sadie settled onto the sofa across from him, her posture steady and unhurried.
“It’s getting late, Mr. Higgins. What brings you over at this hour? Has your family finally sorted things out?” Each word landed with intention.
Jarrett’s expression wavered for half a second.
It didn’t take him long to catch the bite behind her words—she was throwing shade about the scene Yvonne made at the wedding. She knew exactly where to press, and she did it without hesitation.
Though irritation flared in his chest, Jarrett managed to mask it with a polite smile.
“I appreciate the concern, Ms. Hudson. But it wasn’t anything major. Things are under control now.”
After a brief pause, he steered the conversation elsewhere. “I actually came to talk business. There’s an opportunity I thought might interest you.”
The curve of Sadie’s brow lifted, her curiosity clearly piqued.
A polite smile played on her lips as she replied, “You don’t have to be so formal, Mr. Higgins. Our families are practically tied together at this point—no need to beat around the bush.”
Step into a new world at gα?ησνs?c?m
Her shift in tone gave Jarrett the opening he was waiting for.
“You’re sharp, Ms. Hudson. Smarter than most. Nathan? He’s just a spoiled heir with no sense of what real responsibility looks like. For someone like you to go as low as working with him, even using Wall Group’s resources to help him climb—don’t you think he’s just taking advantage of you?”noveldrama
He was casting doubt on Sadie’s judgment while belittling Nathan. Though her expression barely changed, the light in her smile began to fade.
Taking that as a cue, Jarrett decided to lay his cards on the table. “Let me make this simple. If you’re willing to shift your support to me, I’ll hand over half the Higgins Group shares to Wall Group—no strings attached.” That was generous.
Sadie lowered her gaze, releasing a quiet laugh filled with disdain. To her, the Higgins family’s internal rivalry felt more like children bickering on a playground than a true power struggle.
The offer of Higgins Group shares? That was almost laughable. Did Jarrett really think that would tempt her?

###Chapter 941:
Her presence in this mess had never been about business—it was only because Nathan held the thread tying her to her parents.
Half of the Higgins Group—no, even the entire Higgins fortune—held no value in her eyes. The Higgins’ ambitions seemed laughably small. Pushing herself up from the sofa, Sadie no longer bothered to hide her indifference.
“It’s getting late, Mr. Higgins. I need some rest.”
Her eyes flicked toward the doorway. “Tina, would you kindly show our guest out?”
Jarrett hadn’t anticipated rejection that clean—or that cold.
Wheeling forward, he cut across her path.
“Ms. Hudson!” His voice edged toward desperation. “You have to reconsider! Nathan’s a lost cause—he’s never going to rise to anything! I’m the only one who can take the Higgins Group forward. If I partner with Wall Group, both sides stand to gain.”
Sadie halted mid-step, her eyes lowering to meet his with a cold, steady stare.
“Thank you for the offer, Mr. Higgins. But I’m not changing my mind. What happens to your family is your burden to carry. My decisions are my own, and I believe in Nathan.”
She didn’t wait for a reply. Stepping around his wheelchair, she left the room without a second look.
From his place near the door, Jarrett stared after her, his face twisting with barely contained fury.
Sadie! She had dismissed him without hesitation—as if he didn’t matter at all.
So be it. If she refused to take the easier road, then she’d find out just how unforgiving the harder one could be.
The sky had just begun to lighten the next morning when—

Knock, knock, knock! A sharp rapping came at the door.
Sadie blinked awake, her brows drawn together in annoyance. She groaned as she pulled herself out of bed.
Who on earth was making such a racket this early?
She grabbed the knit cardigan from the foot of her bed, throwing it over her shoulders before striding angrily to the door.
She flung it open to find Nathan standing on the other side.
There were dark circles under his eyes, and his hair was disheveled. It looked like he hadn’t slept a wink all night.
Sadie felt a surge of ice-hot anger. Was this guy trying to get himself killed?
“Don’t waste my time and say what you came to say.”
Nathan clearly wasn’t expecting such hostility. He recoiled on instinct, but his sense of urgency had him pushing past any hesitation. Nathan had received word that Jarrett had come to see Sadie last night, and he had been on edge since.
Sleep had evaded him, so the moment dawn broke, he rushed over to talk to her.

###Chapter 942:
“Ms. Hudson—Sadie!” Nathan’s voice was laced with desperation. “I heard that my brother came to see you last night. What happened? What did he say?”
Sadie was slightly mollified by the look of panic on his face. She stepped aside and gestured for him to come in.noveldrama
“It’s just as you heard.” Jarrett had indeed shown up, and he had tried his damnedest to win her over.
Sadie opened her mouth to explain the matter further, but then she looked up and was met by a pitiful display.
Nathan’s eyes were wide as saucers, his shoulders hunched, his lips pursed. He did an excellent impression of a puppy that was scared of getting left behind.
Sadie’s words got stuck in her throat.
What the hell was going on with this guy? Wasn’t he acting all high and mighty at the Higgins family meeting just yesterday?
Nathan grew even more uneasy at her silence. He maintained his expression, even when he watched her closely for any reaction.
“Sadie, you’re not… You’re not
Thinking of changing your mind, are you? Do you also think my brother is better than me? Are you planning to switch over to his side?”
That finally did it.
Sadie was irked enough at having been woken up so unceremoniously; learning that she had been roused just to listen to such nonsense sent her anger soaring to new heights.
This idiot!
Author’s version available at gln ov els.?
She raised her hand and smacked Nathan at the back of the head. “What do you even spend your days thinking about?”
Nathan winced. He heard a ringing in his ears, and his eyes immediately welled up with tears. Still, he managed to stop them from falling altogether.
Then, before Sadie could retract her invitation, he darted past her and into the room.
At that point, the last remnants of sleep were totally gone. Letting out a long sigh, Sadie shut the door and followed Nathan into the living room.
Nathan stood there, nervously shifting his weight from one foot to another, looking every bit like a schoolboy awaiting an inevitable scolding.
Sadie plopped down on the sofa across from him and massaged her aching temples. “Relax. Jarrett’s not going to stir up any trouble.” She crossed her arms over her chest and looked Nathan in the eye. “Everything is settled now. I’ve done my part. You promised to give me information about my parents. What have you got?”
Nathan immediately dropped his sorry act.
His back went straight as he reached into his pocket and took out a folded slip of paper. He handed it to Sadie with both hands. “I’m keeping my end of the bargain. Here you go.”
.

###Chapter 943:
Sadie unfolded the note. A single string of numbers was written on it—a phone number.
“What is this?”
Nathan answered readily. “It’s the contact number of a maid who used to work for your parents. She disappeared with them all those years ago. It took a lot of digging, but I finally found this lead. You can contact her and see if you might be able to uncover what really happened in the past.”
Sadie’s fingers tightened around that small piece of paper, her heart racing.
Nathan noted her serious expression and ventured, “About our so-called engagement, by the way…” He scratched his nose and offered a sheepish smile.
“I’ll make a public announcement to cancel it in a month or so. We can say we weren’t compatible, or maybe come up with a better reason. Don’t worry, I’ll make sure your reputation isn’t tarnished in any way.”
Sadie nodded absentmindedly. The engagement meant nothing to her. Her gaze was fixed on the phone number, her hand trembling ever so slightly.
Her parents had been missing for seventeen years. She hadn’t heard a single word from them in all that time, hadn’t found a single trace. A part of her had even come to believe that they were no longer alive. But now, she finally had a clue in her hands. Even if the chances were slim, she would cling to that tiny sliver of hope.
She had to find them, no matter what!
After all, she had made a promise to her grandmother before she passed. She would find her parents and bring them home, no matter what it took. Even if all she found were their remains, she would still bring them home.
Sadie’s chest swelled with a myriad of emotions. Then suddenly, a wave of nausea came over her, and she felt as though all the strength was drained from her body. Her vision blurred. The room spun.
Your imagination takes flight on g?lnσνs?com
Without any warning, she collapsed in a faint.
“Sadie!” Nathan cried out in alarm, stunned by this sudden turn of events.
What on earth was happening to her?
Why did Sadie collapse all of a sudden?noveldrama
Nathan wasted no time. He lunged forward and caught her in his arms before she fell forward to the floor.
He was immediately startled by her temperature—her body was burning!
Thoroughly alarmed now, he pressed his palm against her forehead. Sure enough, she was running a fever.
Nathan’s heart skipped a beat, and he practically felt the color drain from his face.
Sadie was his lifeline—the only one who could ensure his success. He couldn’t afford to let anything happen to her!
Acting quickly, he carefully picked her up and rushed out of the suite. If something happened to Sadie, he would lose all hope of ever taking over the Higgins Group. His efforts would all go down the drain!

###Chapter 944:
As Nathan made his way to the elevator, he ran into someone coming from the opposite direction.
Rodger was striding toward Sadie’s room, his face grim, his pace brisk. He had come straight from the office, and his mission was to ask Sadie for help with Jarrett’s predicament.
He never expected to walk into such a scene. Why was his reckless second son holding an unconscious Sadie?
Rodger froze in his tracks, his eyes growing wide with disbelief. What had happened to Sadie?
But Nathan had no time to explain. His main concern was the woman in his arms. He didn’t dare to delay a minute longer, for fear that it might make her condition worse.
“Move out of the way, Dad!” Nathan said, his voice tight and urgent. He didn’t wait for his father’s reaction and darted into the elevator just as the doors opened.
Rodger could only stand in place and watch his son disappear as the doors shut.
A terrible sense of foreboding came over him.
Snapping out of his trance, he changed directions and hurried after them.
Nathan burst into the hospital and carried Sadie into the emergency room. “Doctor! I need a doctor!”
A doctor and a handful of nurses soon came over with a stretcher. Nathan placed Sadie on it as gently as he could, then trailed after the medical team as they wheeled her away.
Rodger appeared behind them, his face etched with worry.
The doctor proceeded with an initial assessment, checking Sadie’s temperature and heartbeat.
g?lnσνs．c?, a world of tales
“She’s running a high fever, and her heart rate is a bit fast,” he said after a moment. “Has she been under a lot of stress? Might be physical or emotional.”
Nathan hesitated before nodding. When he thought about it, Sadie was both physically and emotionally drained.
The doctor didn’t press further. He simply ordered a full panel of tests to be done on Sadie. “We’ll need to draw blood and run a more thorough check-up.”noveldrama
Half an hour later, the doctor approached Nathan and Rodger in the hallway, report in hand, his expression unreadable.
“Are you the patient’s husband?”
Nathan nodded without thinking, still shaken by the whole ordeal.
“Congratulations. Your wife is pregnant. She is just a little over a month along.”
The words fell like a bolt of lightning. Both Nathan and Rodger were stunned into silence. What was happening?
Thinking that they were merely surprised by the unexpected news, the doctor handed Nathan the report. “She fainted because of the fever. She will need proper and ample rest from now on.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 945:
Nathan was rooted to the spot, his mind spinning.
The doctor gave a few more instructions before leaving, but none of it really registered to either man.
When they were finally left alone, Nathan stared at the report in his hands, still struggling to wrap his mind around it.
Whose child was Sadie carrying?
It certainly wasn’t his. They had always maintained a professional relationship. They hadn’t even held hands!
He was still reeling from the news when a large hand suddenly snatched the report from his grasp.
Rodger scanned the page line by line, his eyes blazing.
Sadie and Nathan hadn’t even met a month ago. At that time, Nathan was still getting tangled up with multiple other women.
So, who was the father of this child?
Rodger slowly raised his head, his voice low and cutting. “Is this baby yours?”noveldrama
How could Nathan possibly misread his father’s thoughts? If the child wasn’t his, the repercussions would shatter everything.
With Rodger’s calculating mind, he would inevitably weaponize the situation—wielding the suspicion of a premarital affair to coerce Sadie into deeper sacrifices.
He might even dissolve the engagement entirely and thrust Jarrett back into position as the rightful heir.
If that transpired, Nathan would find himself utterly discarded. Unthinkable. He simply couldn’t allow such a fate.
  ? ? ?αν．
His thoughts spiraled wildly, and within a single pulse of his racing heart, his decision crystallized.
A hint of embarrassment flickered across his features as a hesitant smile pulled at the corners of his mouth.
“Dad, you’ve misinterpreted the situation entirely. Sadie and I have actually known each other intimately for quite some time. We just… chose to keep it private.”
With those carefully chosen words, he had effectively claimed paternity of the child growing in Sadie’s womb.
Rodger halted, momentarily blindsided. He scrutinized Nathan’s expression with piercing intensity. Could this rebellious offspring of his actually be speaking truthfully?
A shadow of disappointment darkened his features—if the child truly belonged to Nathan, his leverage over Sadie would evaporate entirely. Yet, upon further reflection, if the child carried Higgins blood through its veins, perhaps the situation offered unexpected advantages.
It meant Sadie would be bound even more irrevocably to the Higgins family. The alliance between Wall Group and Higgins Group would be cemented in ways mere contracts never could.
.
.
.
###Chapter 946:
The realization washed over Rodger with delicious satisfaction. For once, he actually found Nathan’s existence somewhat tolerable. Finally, this disappointing son had proven useful at a critical juncture.
Rodger cleared his throat decisively. “In that case, the moment Ms. Hudson regains consciousness, you two must commence wedding preparations immediately. Time is of the essence. She’s barely past the one-month mark—she”
Can still showcase a wedding gown properly. Delay any further, and her expanding silhouette will become visible. Nothing will drape correctly then, and orchestrating a suitable ceremony will prove exponentially more challenging.noveldrama
Behind his pragmatic words, Rodger’s mind already tabulated the countless ways this advantageous union would elevate the Higgins family.
Nathan’s carefully constructed smile crumbled at the edges. A wedding ceremony now? Had the universe crafted this cruel jest specifically for him? If Patrick discovered his intentions to wed Sadie… Ice crystallized along his vertebrae. The vivid image of his own spectacular destruction unfolded before his mind’s eye.
His heart hammered against his ribcage, yet he commanded his facial muscles to maintain the facade of pleasure.
“Dad, don’t you consider that somewhat precipitous? Let’s at least wait until Sadie regains consciousness—we should discuss these arrangements with her directly.”
Nathan balanced precariously on the precipice of emotional collapse. The situation careened wildly beyond his grasp.
At that precise moment, on the sterile hospital bed, Sadie’s delicate lashes trembled against her pale cheeks. Gradually, her heavy eyelids parted.
With considerable effort, she rotated her head against the pillow and registered Rodger’s and Nathan’s looming figures stationed at her bedside.
Ch@pter updat3s at glovels.o
Consciousness settled upon her like a veil of mist, her thoughts rotating in disorienting patterns.
The instant Rodger detected her consciousness, his stern countenance transformed dramatically into a radiant display of concern.
“Oh, Ms. Hudson, you’ve rejoined us at last! How are you feeling? Any discomforts plaguing you? The physician attributes your condition to mere overexertion. These early stages of pregnancy drain one’s vitality considerably—you must prioritize recuperation and restoration.” Rodger’s demeanor dripped with manufactured solicitude and uncharacteristic tenderness.
“At present, your sole obligation is safeguarding yourself and the precious child within. Dismiss all thoughts of professional obligations temporarily. Furthermore, banish any concerns regarding Higgins family matters—Nathan shoulders those responsibilities now. I shall withdraw to permit your convalescence. Expect my return on a subsequent occasion.”
The gentle cadence of his voice rendered him nearly unrecognizable.
As Rodger pivoted toward Nathan, his voice instantly hardened to granite. “Nathan, Ms. Hudson’s physical state remains fragile. Your presence must be constant, ensuring her care meets exacting standards. Should any misfortune befall either her or my grandchild, retribution will fall squarely upon your shoulders!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 947:
The prospect of harm befalling his newly discovered grandchild represented an intolerable risk to his dynastic ambitions.
Having delivered his imperatives, Rodger acknowledged his own authority with a satisfied nod. He meticulously adjusted his silk tie, visibly gratified with this unexpected turn of events, then strode purposefully from the sterile hospital chamber.
The antiseptic air hung heavy between Sadie and Nathan, now the room’s sole occupants.noveldrama
Sadie remained enveloped in cognitive fog, Rodger’s startling revelation having delivered a psychological blow more potent than her physical ailment.
She was pregnant? How had this momentous development escaped her attention? Her body had betrayed no obvious signals of this life-altering condition.
Her unfocused eyes drifted languidly toward Nathan’s apprehensive figure.
As their gazes locked, his features rearranged themselves into an expression of culpable discomfort.
He inclined his body toward her, his voice descending to a whisper. “Sadie… the pregnancy is genuine. Medical confirmation places conception slightly beyond four weeks ago. With my father present, I manufactured necessary falsehoods solely to defuse his suspicions.” His hand traveled nervously to massage the tense muscles at his nape, discomfort radiating from every pore. “I claimed paternity of your child.” The declaration had materialized from desperate improvisation—a hasty barrier erected against the tsunami of Rodger’s potential machinations.
Sadie’s brow furrowed deeply. Nathan’s mouth continued forming words, but they dissolved into meaningless vibrations before reaching her consciousness.
With primal intuition guiding her movements, her trembling fingers ascended to rest protectively across the still-flat plane of her abdomen. Could another fragile existence truly be taking form within her womb? Pregnancy had revisited her? And conception occurred merely four weeks prior?
è ￠?ΔT?εЯ? ?η ?a?иoν.
Memories assaulted her consciousness with brutal clarity—Noah’s concealed features, the searing electricity of his intimate caress—every sensation cascaded through her mind with merciless intensity.
This embryonic life carried Noah’s genetic imprint!
Sadie’s delicate fingers contracted into tight fists as a maelstrom of conflicting emotions seized control of her faculties.
How had fate engineered such a devastating complication? Noah was already married to Hailey, and imminently they would welcome their own offspring. What significance could her parallel pregnancy possibly hold amid this tangled web?
Nathan observed the transformation sweeping across her features. Evidently, his elaborate justification had failed to penetrate the fortress of her introspection.
“Sadie, your physical well-being must remain paramount. Reserve these complex contemplations for when strength returns to your body.”
.

.
###Chapter 948:
“I’ll try to rest now. I’ll call Tina and ask her to come look after you,” Nathan murmured, his voice softening with genuine concern.
Sadie acknowledged him with nothing more than a faint hum, her listless gaze fixed on the sterile ceiling tiles above her.
Witnessing her in such a detached state, Nathan chose silence over empty reassurances. He pivoted on his heel and departed the hospital room with hurried, purposeful steps.
He required Tina’s presence without delay. The situation had spiraled far beyond the boundaries of his capabilities.
And compounding his growing anxiety, the looming challenge of explaining this situation to Patrick still awaited him.
When Nathan’s call illuminated her phone screen, Tina had been nervously pacing the room with mounting concern.
Sadie had merely mentioned feeling somewhat fatigued and requiring brief respite—how had her condition deteriorated so drastically that she now lay unconscious in a hospital bed?
Nathan had divulged few specifics during their brief conversation, offering only an urgent directive to hasten to the hospital without a moment’s delay.
Tina terminated the call, her heartbeat thundering against her ribcage with escalating dread. Consumed by mounting panic, she snatched her coat from its hook and bolted through the doorway.
Only upon arriving at the hospital entrance did she glance downward and discover that in her frenzied departure, she had mismatched her footwear, each shoe adorning the incorrect foot.noveldrama
But such trivial matters registered as utterly inconsequential in this moment. She hastened through the antiseptic corridors until identifying the correct room number.
L?tst chαpt?rs in lnovels.
Not until her eyes confirmed the sight of Sadie propped upright against starched pillows, complexion ashen yet mercifully alert, did Tina finally release the breath she had unknowingly imprisoned in her lungs.
“Oh, Sadie!” Tina lunged toward her friend’s bedside, moisture welling in her frightened eyes. “You terrified me beyond measure! Nathan mentioned you collapsed—my mind immediately conjured the worst possibilities.”
Sadie observed Tina’s distressed expression and summoned a weak smile to her pallid lips. “I’m managing well enough. Extreme exhaustion overwhelmed me—I simply lost consciousness momentarily. Please forgive me for causing such distress.”
Tina suppressed a sniffle and attempted to regain her composure, blinking back the remnants of unshed tears. Suddenly, recollection of Nathan’s additional revelation during their telephone conversation resurfaced in her mind.
“Sadie, Nathan revealed something extraordinary… you’re carrying a child? What’s happening? What course of action should we undertake now?”
Sadie’s fragile smile evaporated instantaneously. A contemplative silence enveloped her for several heartbeats, her previously vacant gaze crystallizing with newfound determination.
.
.
.
###Chapter 949:
“Listen carefully, Tina. I require you to establish contact with Blaine—with absolute discretion. Inform him his presence in Beversea is urgently needed at the earliest possible opportunity.”
Certain matters existed within this complex scenario that only Blaine possessed the skills and connections to navigate successfully.
Tina’s entire body momentarily immobilized, her intuition instantly registering the profound seriousness underlying this unexpected request.
She didn’t dare ask any more questions. She nodded seriously. “Alright, Sadie. I’m on it.”
She pivoted sharply and hastened from the sterile chamber, eyes already scanning for a secluded location where she might place this critically sensitive telephone call without unwelcome eavesdroppers.
In the meantime, Rodger traversed the threshold of the imposing Higgins Manor, an uncharacteristic melody escaping his lips as contentment radiated from his typically severe countenance.
His spirits soared to unprecedented heights—fortune had apparently chosen this precise moment to bestow her elusive favor upon his ambitious schemes.
Jarrett glanced upward from his wheelchair, genuine astonishment crossing his features. His father’s display of unbridled cheerfulness constituted a truly unusual phenomenon.
“Dad, what extraordinary circumstances have transformed your typically stoic demeanor into this unexpected jubilation?”
Rodger’s already expansive smile stretched further when he saw his firstborn. He advanced toward Jarrett with energetic purpose.
“Jarrett! Most magnificent developments have transpired! Ms. Hudson carries within her womb—Nathan’s offspring!” His proclamation resonated throughout the room, undisguised exhilaration permeating every syllable.noveldrama
  ɡν﹒
“With this child, our alliance with the Wall Group is sealed. Henceforth, our dominant position within Beversea society stands utterly unassailable!”
Jarrett’s countenance hardened into impenetrable granite. That worthless disappointment Nathan had genuinely succeeded in impregnating Sadie?
At that precise moment, Ophelia appeared at the top of the grand staircase. She had just begun her descent when Rodger’s thunderous declaration reverberated throughout the expansive living room. Her body froze in mid-motion, paralyzed by shock.
Sadie carried a child? Nathan’s progeny grew within her? Impossible—utterly inconceivable! Her mind refused to accept such an egregious reality.
The blood drained precipitously from her features, leaving behind an alabaster mask of disbelief as she lurched awkwardly down the stairs, equilibrium compromised by emotional devastation.
“Rodger! What preposterous statement have you just uttered? How could Sadie possibly find herself with a child? To whom does parentage of this alleged baby belong?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 950:
Rodger’s expression contorted with disapproval at her unbridled emotional eruption. He was visibly irritated by this unseemly display of vulnerability.
“What alternative paternity might you possibly suggest beyond Nathan’s?” he retorted, his syllables sharpened with undisguised annoyance.
Through Rodger’s critical gaze, Ophelia’s status deteriorated steadily into an ever-deepening chasm of familial embarrassment.
He had consistently bestowed preferential treatment upon Jarrett, his firstborn pride, while regarding Nathan as nothing more than the family’s perpetual disappointment.
However, the life developing within Sadie’s womb—this represented nothing less than the glorious destiny of the Higgins family! An unparalleled strategic advantage capable of generating immeasurable rewards!
The entire landscape of power had transformed irrevocably.
Rodger dismissed Ophelia’s presence entirely from his consciousness. He pivoted decisively and ascended the staircase. “I must select an appropriate gift for Ms.
“Hudson. Something substantial enough to guarantee the continued health of both mother and child.”
The expansive living space now contained only Jarrett and Ophelia, enveloped in a suffocating silence punctuated by unspoken rage. Ophelia remained rooted in position, a glacial coldness permeating her very marrow. Why had fate bestowed upon Sadie the privilege of bearing Nathan’s child? She alone deserved to stand by his side—never this interloping Sadie! That calculating temptress had undoubtedly employed dishonorable tactics to secure his affections!
Jarrett remained confined to his wheelchair, his visage clouded with a malevolence that mirrored Ophelia’s own internal tempest.
Sadie carried a new life within her. Furthermore, Nathan had fathered this consequential offspring. Should she successfully deliver this infant, the corporate entities of Higgins Group and Wall Group would become even more intertwined.
  ν?
Upon realization of this eventuality, Nathan—alongside his supposedly betrothed partner—would thoroughly overshadow Jarrett’s influence. His already tenuous position within the familial hierarchy would deteriorate toward complete irrelevance.
Absolutely not. Under no circumstances could he permit such a catastrophic realignment of power to materialize!noveldrama
Jarrett and Ophelia were left alone in the living room.
Although their thoughts were not exactly aligned, their goals definitely were.
Their eyes met by chance, and Ophelia felt her heart skip a beat.
She didn’t miss the malice that glinted in Jarrett’s gaze.
Much like her, he couldn’t stand Sadie, either, nor could he accept the existence of the child Sadie carried. Jarrett no doubt saw the unborn baby as an abomination of sorts.
Ophelia’s lips curled into a sly smile as she slowly approached him, her stride confident and sure. “Why don’t we work together this time, Jarrett? We can have a mutually beneficial alliance.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 951:
Jarrett lifted his gaze at her words, his eyes gleaming like ice.
Ophelia was more impatient than he had initially thought. Still, a pawn was willingly volunteering itself to serve his purpose. He would be a fool to waste this opportunity.
A cunning smile tugged at the corners of his lips. “Oh? What do you have in mind?”
Ophelia leaned in closer.
“It’s simple,” she whispered. “We just need to eliminate Sadie’s baby. It would secure your position in the Higgins family, and I can finally be rid of that wretched thorn in my side.”
The mere thought of Nathan being forever bound to Sadie because of some unborn child was enough to send Ophelia spiraling in a fit of jealousy and hatred.
Jarrett’s smile widened. “You’d do well to remember your current status, Ophelia.” His voice was quiet, but the warning was clear. “If you dare to betray me or try anything behind my back…”
He paused and drew closer, so close that his breath fanned her ear. “I will personally see to an endless suffering for you.”
Ophelia felt a chill run down her spine. Cold sweat beaded at her nape. She had heard some stories, so she was quite familiar with Jarrett’s methods. She had no doubt he meant every word.
Her smile was strained, barely masking her fear. “Come on, Jarrett. We…”
—We’re husband and wife. I would never do such a thing.” Even as she said this, Ophelia knew they were but hollow words.
Thankfully, Jarrett didn’t press the matter.
He shifted in his wheelchair and settled into a more comfortable position. “I will have Colin assist you.”
?  ? g?ν?
Colin Larson was Jarrett’s most trusted aide, and he was known for the flawless execution of his orders.
“If you need anything, you may go directly to him.”noveldrama
Ophelia felt a surge of joy and triumph. The fact that Jarrett was willing to get Colin involved meant that he was taking her proposal seriously. It also meant that her chances of success had just increased significantly.
She bobbed her head in earnest. “Got it, Jarrett.”
Now that she had Jarrett’s support, Ophelia was confident that she could make the child disappear without any hardship or consequences. Sadie’s happy days were numbered.
Meanwhile, at Beversea Hospital, Sadie’s complexion was still a little pale as she lay on the hospital bed. She squirmed under the covers, trying to pull herself into a sitting position.
“Ah! Sadie!” Tina had gone out to get lunch, but was so startled by what she saw upon returning to the room that she almost dropped the lunchbox.
.
.
.
###Chapter 952:
She quickly rushed to the bed and gently pressed Sadie back to a lying position.
“You can’t move around as you please! The doctor said you’re in a delicate stage right now. You need a lot of bed rest. You can’t afford to be careless!”
Tina’s face was wrought with concern.
Sadie blinked in surprise, but she complied and lay back against the pillows.
She watched Tina move around like a mother hen, and felt a warmth spread across her chest.noveldrama
“You’ve been taking such good care of me, Tina. What about Averi? How is he?”
Tina opened the lunchbox and replied, “You don’t have to worry about him. I already made arrangements for Averi. Jack had his best bodyguards escort him back to Jazmah. I’ve informed Mrs. Isabel Wall of the situation, and she is waiting for Averi to return to Wall Manor. I’m sure she will take excellent care of him.”
Sadie closed her eyes, feeling a weight lift from her heart.
“And what did the doctor say? When can I be discharged?”
She didn’t want to stay in the hospital for much longer. There was still so much she needed to take care of.
Tina hesitated before answering. “I talked to the doctor, and… He said your high fever has taken a toll on your body. The baby’s condition is a little unstable at the moment. You’ll need to stay in the hospital for further observation, just to make sure both you and the baby are well. The doctor also emphasized that you absolutely cannot move around recklessly or travel long distances in the near future. Otherwise, it could pose risks to your pregnancy.”
Tina set the food down on the bedside table and picked up the spoon.
Upd4t3s c0m3 F1RST 0n g4ln0v3ls.c0m
Her voice was softer when she said, “Don’t stress yourself out overthinking it. Just focus on your recovery for now. Here you go, eat up. The doctor said you need plenty of nutrition.”
Sadie gazed listlessly at the meal before her, her hunger vanishing entirely in the face of overwhelming circumstances.
She acknowledged the offering with a distracted nod, her thoughts drifting far beyond the sterile hospital walls that confined her.
Her body betrayed no physical evidence of its extraordinary condition, yet the knowledge of a minuscule existence developing within her womb unleashed a tempest of emotions she struggled to identify. She had scarcely managed a reluctant mouthful of the bland beef when the door exploded inward with a reverberating crash against the wall. Blaine materialized in the doorway, his imposing figure silhouetted dramatically against the corridor’s fluorescent lighting.
Sadie’s muscles locked in astonishment, her fork suspended midair. How had he managed to arrive with such impossible speed?
Blaine charged into the chamber, undisguised alarm apparent in every feature of his typically composed face. His frantic eyes traversed her form repeatedly, conducting an urgent visual assessment of her condition.
.
.
.
###Chapter 953:noveldrama
“Sadie! What catastrophe befell you? Is your condition stable? What in God’s name has transpired here?”
His grandfather’s repeated admonitions to safeguard Sadie’s well-being echoed accusingly in his consciousness. And now, following merely a brief professional excursion, she languished in a hospital bed? Should his grandfather discover this development, consequences of unimaginable severity would surely follow.
Sadie directed a meaningful glance toward Tina, who maintained a respectful silence nearby, and communicated her wishes through the subtlest inclination of her chin—a silent command for privacy.
Tina interpreted the unspoken instruction instantaneously. She retreated from the room with tactical discretion, easing the door shut with deliberate care, sealing the pair in complete isolation.
Sadie elevated her trembling fingers and rested them delicately across her still-flat abdomen. “I’m carrying a child.”
Her declaration struck Blaine with the devastating force of an unexpected lightning strike from cloudless skies. The impact rivaled what he might experience upon hearing that the entire Wall Group empire had collapsed into ruins within a single night.
Astonishment transformed his features—eyes widening to their limits while his jaw worked mechanically without producing coherent sound, rendering him momentarily speechless.
He inclined his upper body toward her with tentative movements, his typically confident voice now fragile with disbelief. “This must be some elaborate jest, surely? Could Noah have somehow defied mortality itself and… and fathered this child?”
The absurdity of his own suggestion registered even as the final syllables escaped his lips. He inwardly chastised himself—the deceased remained permanently beyond reach, an immutable law of existence that permitted no exceptions.

His mind whirled chaotically through possibilities until abruptly seizing upon another potential candidate with startling clarity. “One moment… might Nathan bear responsibility for this unexpected development?”
Merely days before, during his business dealings in Jazmah, whispers had reached his ears regarding Sadie’s alleged engagement to Nathan—that notorious libertine scion of the powerful Higgins family, ruling Beversea’s elite circles.
The shocking revelation had almost caused the tumbler to slip from his grasp when the information first assaulted his consciousness.
And now this declaration of pregnancy emerged from Sadie’s own lips? What labyrinthine scheme had unfolded here?
Sadie expelled a weary breath laden with unspoken complexities, her expression reflecting surrender to circumstances beyond her control as she confronted his obvious skepticism. “Nathan bears no connection to this situation.”
Her denial etched profound furrows across Blaine’s brow as concentration transformed his features. His analytical mind methodically cataloged and evaluated every conceivable candidate until a singular identity crystallized with inexorable certainty.

###Chapter 954:
Patrick, of course! The man who had stayed by Sadie’s side all the time. Blaine’s countenance hardened into a mask of vigilant concern. His eyes darted reflexively toward the entrance, ensuring that their confidential exchange remained shielded from potential eavesdroppers. Closing the distance between them further, he lowered his voice to barely above a whisper. “This child growing within you… Patrick is the father, correct?”
Sadie offered no verbal confirmation, yet her profound silence manifested more eloquently than any spoken affirmation possibly could.
A thunderous pulsation overwhelmed Blaine’s auditory senses as blood rushed forcefully through his veins. Confirmation of Patrick’s involvement collapsed upon his consciousness with nearly unbearable gravity.
Sadie, demonstrating remarkable resilience, had already reconstructed her emotional fortifications. She elevated her chin slightly, meeting his troubled expression with tranquil determination radiating from her unwavering gaze.
“My physical condition remains somewhat precarious at present. The doctor has strongly advised extensive recuperation. Regarding corporate matters, I must impose upon your capabilities to assume temporary leadership. Additionally—I desire strict limitations on knowledge of this pregnancy for the immediate future.
For the current period, we shall inform all Wall Group personnel that intensive wedding preparations with Nathan consume my attention alongside certain confidential personal matters requiring resolution. Throughout this interval, substantial portions of my responsibilities shall transfer to your oversight.”noveldrama
She paused momentarily, lingering discomfort evident in her slight hesitation. “Samuel’s expertise shall complement yours throughout this transitional arrangement.”
Corporate leadership represented territory where Blaine navigated with unwavering self-assurance and formidable expertise.

Emerging abruptly from his momentary stupefaction, he discarded his characteristic nonchalance like a suddenly inappropriate garment. His features rearranged themselves into uncharacteristic gravity. “Sadie, surely you cannot genuinely contemplate matrimony with Nathan?” Tales of Nathan’s character had inundated Blaine’s ears even in Jazmah—accounts depicting an overindulged heir, impulsive, and possessing an insatiable appetite for feminine conquests…
What inconceivable circumstances could drive Sadie to entertain union with such a fundamentally compromised individual?
“The arrangement exists purely as strategic camouflage,” Sadie clarified, her tone deliberately devoid of emotional inflection.
Comprehension dawned with merciful clarity. Mere theatrical performance, nothing substantive. Blaine expelled a prolonged breath of profound gratitude. Divine providence had preserved Sadie’s legendary rational faculties intact.
“Understood completely,” he affirmed with resolute conviction. “Entrust corporate matters entirely to my oversight. I shall manage all operational aspects comprehensively. Direct your energies exclusively toward personal recovery.”

###Chapter 955:
“Should any complications arise, contact me without reservation regardless of timing.”
Sadie acknowledged his commitment with the barest inclination of her head, exhaustion etching itself across her delicate features.
Blaine offered a final gentle admonishment regarding her need for recuperation, then pivoted decisively and strode from the room with purposeful steps.
Tina maintained her vigilant presence in the corridor, traversing the limited space with nervous energy. The instant his form emerged from the doorway, her restless movement ceased abruptly, concern emanating visibly from her expressive gaze.
Blaine found himself powerless against the temptation to provoke a reaction from her. He theatrically cleared his throat before displaying his characteristic mischievous smile. “My, my, enchanting one. Fancy seeing you again.”
An inexplicable magnetism radiated from Tina’s disconcerted demeanor, captivating his attention in ways he hadn’t anticipated.
Tina was visibly startled at his unexpected address, reflexively retreating a half-step. “Mr. Castro, have… have you and Sadie reached necessary understandings regarding the situation?”
Blaine extended his palms outward in an elaborate gesture of assumed competence, elevating his jawline with unmistakable self-satisfaction. “Naturally. No challenge exists beyond my considerable capabilities.”noveldrama
Blaine’s words died on his lips, cut short mid-sentence.
Tina had already brushed past him, shoving the door open with unmistakable urgency as she hurried into the hospital room. “Sadie!” she called out.
She left Blaine standing there with his arm still half-raised, completely frozen in place as the atmosphere crackled with sudden awkwardness. Had she really just dismissed him so completely? She really couldn’t care less about him, could she? Still, he had to admit—teasing her sparked a certain thrill he found difficult to ignore.
  ?  ? gν.o m
Blaine rubbed his nose, a flush of embarrassment warming his face, and slowly lowered his hand. There were more pressing matters demanding his attention.
He turned on his heel and strode out of the hospital, slipped into his car, and fired up the engine. Minutes later, the highway stretched before him like an endless ribbon.
He needed to return to Jazmah and handle the tasks Sadie had entrusted to him.
A three-hour drive wasn’t exactly torture, but it certainly tested one’s patience. Still, Blaine hummed a nameless tune, feeling oddly lighthearted.
The traffic thinned considerably after he exited the highway. Then, without a whisper of warning, the unexpected shattered his calm. Several black vehicles materialized from both sides and converged behind Blaine’s car with predatory precision.
They moved in perfect synchronization—swift, deliberate, and methodical. Within moments, they’d expertly boxed him in and forced him onto the shoulder.
Blaine’s heart slammed against his ribs as he stomped on the brakes. What the hell was happening? A brazen daylight robbery? Or had someone specifically targeted him?
.

###Chapter 956:
His mind frantically cataloged every questionable deed that might have provoked retribution. Nothing particularly damning surfaced in his memory. At worst, he’d pursued a few women and left some broken hearts in his wake.
The doors of the black cars swung open in eerie unison. Several imposing figures in immaculate black suits and opaque sunglasses emerged—textbook security professionals straight from central casting. One of them approached Blaine’s window and rapped his knuckles against the glass—authoritative yet restrained.
“Mr. Castro,” he said with mechanical precision, his voice devoid of emotion, “Our employer requests your immediate presence for a conversation.”
Blaine blinked rapidly, bewilderment clouding his features. What on earth was unfolding here?noveldrama
The odds were stacked heavily against him. Resistance seemed pointless and potentially dangerous. He might as well cooperate and discover the purpose behind this elaborate interception.
Swallowing the knot of apprehension in his throat, Blaine pushed open the door and climbed out. “Alright then. Lead the way,” he said with forced casualness.
Two stone-faced guards materialized at his sides, escorting him toward the central vehicle—a gleaming, midnight-black luxury sedan that screamed power and wealth.
The door thumped closed behind him with ominous finality. Inside, shadows dominated the dimly lit interior, and the atmosphere pressed down like a physical weight.
Blaine cleared his throat deliberately, attempting to pierce the suffocating silence. “So, who exactly is your boss? If someone orchestrated this elaborate production just to meet me, I believe I’ve earned the courtesy of a name.”
Silence greeted his inquiry. Neither the driver, the guard in the passenger seat, nor those flanking him acknowledged his question. They remained forward-facing and motionless, resembling carved sentinels rather than living men.

Discomfort crawled across Blaine’s skin, the prolonged silence making him shift uneasily in his seat.
Fine, the silent treatment it was. Blaine forced a smirk and settled back against the supple leather, surveying the opulent interior with feigned interest.
Whoever commanded such resources was undoubtedly swimming in wealth or wielding considerable influence—perhaps both.
Half an hour of tense silence later, the motorcade glided to a halt outside the imposing facade of Autumn Garden Villa.
Recognition flickered across Blaine’s face—this prestigious property allegedly belonged to someone whose connections reached into the highest echelons of power.
The guards shepherded him through marble hallways into the villa’s cavernous living room, their footsteps echoing against polished floors. Noah lounged on an elegant couch, his lean frame wrapped in an impeccably tailored black suit.

###Chapter 957:
Features concealed behind that characteristic silver mask, he idly swirled a glass of burgundy wine that caught the light like liquid rubies.
The vice grip of tension around Blaine’s chest loosened marginally when he recognized his host. So it was Patrick after all. Yet this theatrical production seemed wildly disproportionate for a simple meeting.
Blaine inwardly cursed the needless drama, then crafted a perfectly relaxed grin. He sauntered across the room and dropped onto the opposing couch with calculated nonchalance, each movement projecting easy confidence.
“Quite the production you’ve arranged, Mr. Noel. All this elaborate staging just for little old me? Don’t tell me you’ve finally reconsidered that collaboration proposal I’ve been dangling.”
Though Blaine’s voice carried playful notes and his smile appeared carefree, beneath the surface, his senses remained razor-sharp. An instinctive suspicion whispered that this unexpected meeting connected directly to Sadie.
Her instructions had been unambiguous—absolute secrecy regarding her pregnancy. Blaine assumed this mandate extended even to Patrick, the child’s father. One careless word could unravel everything, and he couldn’t afford such a catastrophic misstep.
Noah abruptly ceased the hypnotic motion of his wine and lifted his gaze, his eyes mysterious pools of shadow behind the metallic mask. “Where did you journey today, Mr. Castro?” The question hung in the air, deceptively casual yet unmistakably pointed.
Blaine’s pulse faltered momentarily. So that explained this charade. Patrick had orchestrated this entire performance specifically to extract information from him.
His thoughts pivoted seamlessly as he mentally retrieved the fabricated narrative he’d carefully constructed for such contingencies.
?tｅt ? ? gαlnovels.ｃοm
“Where else would a man like me spend his free time?” He reclined with practiced indolence, crossing one leg over the other with deliberate slowness, embodying careless self-assurance.
“I encountered this absolute vision in Beversea recently—statuesque legs, curves that defy description. Secured her a modest property there. Found myself with unexpected leisure today, so naturally, I made a… personal appearance.”
Blaine arched his eyebrows with exaggerated suggestiveness, his voice deliberately laden with innuendo as he maintained the carefully crafted facade of a carefree playboy.
Noah’s lips twisted into the barest suggestion of a smile, frigid as midwinter frost. “Is that indeed the case?” The words dripped with quiet skepticism.
Beneath Blaine’s chest, his heart hammered wildly with mounting dread, yet not a flicker of distress breached his carefully maintained veneer of casual indifference.
“Cross my heart,” he declared with theatrical solemnity, pressing his palm against his chest in an elaborate pantomime of earnestness.

###Chapter 958:
His features then rearranged into an expression of conspiratorial entreaty. “Come on, Mr. Noel, keep this between us gentlemen, won’t you? If my grandfather discovers I’ve kept a woman, he’ll personally ensure I never walk properly again!”
Blaine committed fully to the performance, inhabiting every nuance of the harmless, pleasure-seeking libertine he pretended to be.
Noah remained utterly unmoved, his disinterest palpable in the cool silence that followed.
With deliberate precision, he placed the crystal wineglass on the table with a soft clink. “This mysterious enchantress of yours… she wouldn’t by chance answer to the name Tina, would she?” The question sliced through Blaine’s fabrication like a surgeon’s scalpel.
The unexpected question struck like lightning, paralyzing Blaine completely for two excruciating seconds as his mind scrambled to recalibrate.
Why had Patrick abruptly brought up Tina? Had some crucial information slipped through his defenses without his knowledge? Blaine’s heart performed a sickening lurch against his ribcage as icy perspiration erupted across his spine, dampening his shirt.
Panic threatened to overwhelm him, but he ruthlessly suppressed the rising tide of fear and schooled his features into practiced neutrality. “So what if it happens to be her?” He waved his hand dismissively, feigning impatience.noveldrama
“Now that you know, there’s no need for me to deny it. But Mr. Noel, this whole dramatic ‘invitation’—don’t you think it’s a bit much? Next time, just send me a text.”
He attempted a casual laugh as he desperately tried to defuse the crackling tension permeating the room.
But Noah pierced him with a glacial stare that effectively silenced any further pretense, his interest in conversation clearly exhausted. With the slightest inclination of his head, he signaled to the waiting guards. Without hesitation or warning, they surged forward in perfect coordination and seized Blaine’s arms in vicelike grips that permitted no resistance.

Shock paralyzed Blaine momentarily before panic erupted. “Hey, wait!”
“Mr. Noel! What’s the meaning of this? Let’s discuss this rationally! Where are you taking me?” His protests escalated to frantic shouts as they forcibly removed him from the room.
In the wake of his departure, oppressive silence reclaimed the cavernous space.
Jack stepped in and positioned himself deferentially in front of Noah. “Boss, shall I investigate Mr. Castro’s activities in Beversea today?” he inquired with professional detachment.
Noah dismissed the suggestion with an almost imperceptible shake of his head. “That won’t be necessary,” he murmured, his voice low and contemplative. Blaine’s unexplained journey to Beversea already reeked of suspicion and deception.
Since Noah left Beversea, Sadie had maintained a troubling and uncharacteristic silence. The entire Higgins clan exhibited alarming behavior patterns as well. Jarrett had attempted to visit Sadie, only to be rebuffed. Then, Nathan had frantically transported an unconscious Sadie from her hotel to the hospital. Rodger had appeared shortly thereafter.

###Chapter 959:
Something sinister undoubtedly lurked beneath the surface of these events. What truth lay hidden behind the facade of normalcy in Beversea?
The butler stepped into the room. His footsteps were light, his expression wary.
“Mr. Noel, Ms. Burgess is at the door. She insists on seeing you.”
Noah paused, his brows furrowing beneath his mask. A trace of impatience flickered in his eyes, but it was gone in the next second.
“Send her away,” he said in a voice that brooked no argument.
The butler’s chest tightened from the pressure. He was just about to leave and deliver Noah’s response when they overheard Hailey’s shouts from outside. They were slightly muffled at first, but they were definitely getting louder.
“Let me in! I am his wife! You have no right to stop me! Let go! I said, let me in, right this instant!” Hailey continued to yell.
Noah’s expression darkened. He might have been too lenient with this woman; it had emboldened her somehow.
The butler bowed his head in fright, not daring to even breathe. Noah cast a cold glance toward Jack, who stood waiting nearby. The latter gave a small nod of understanding and strode outside.
Right at the villa’s entrance, Hailey was berating a team of tall, black-clad bodyguards that blocked her path.
Her face was flushed with indignation as she repeatedly tried and failed to shove them out of her way. She was desperately trying to force her way inside.noveldrama
“Let me go! I’m Patrick Noel’s wife! How dare you stop me?”
Jack approached, his face devoid of any emotion. “Ms. Burgess, I’m afraid Mr. Noel doesn’t want to see you. I must ask you to leave immediately. If you keep this up, it will only result in something unpleasant for all of us.”
 ? : g?ν
Hailey froze. When she saw that it was Jack, her arrogance melted away.
Jack was Noah’s most trusted confidant, and his words were as good as Noah’s.
Her eyes welled up with tears. “Jack, please, it’s been so long since I last saw him. I miss him so much. Please, just this once. Please let me see him just once!” Hailey looked up at Jack with pleading eyes, hoping against hope that her tears would sway him.
But Jack was unmoved. If anything, his gaze seemed to have grown colder.
Indeed, Jack had long seen through Hailey’s facade and was now familiar with her manipulative tactics. He nodded at the bodyguards before giving them a new instruction. “Escort Ms. Burgess out of the property.”
The men wasted no time. Two of them immediately stepped forward and grabbed Hailey by the arms.
“No! Let go of me!” Hailey flailed and tried to break free from their hold, but the bodyguards showed no mercy.

###Chapter 960:
They tightened their grip on her and practically dragged her to the gates.
Along the way, one of her heels got caught in the gravel and broke, causing her to stumble. She was even more of a mess than when she had arrived.
“Let go of me! Noah! Noah, come out! Come out here and face me!” she kept screaming. But the only response she got was a loud bang as the gates slammed shut in her face.
Hailey had been thrown unceremoniously out onto the gravel path.
Her knees and elbows stung, having been scraped raw during her fall.
Her face was ashen, and she felt cold all over.
How could this be happening? Noah didn’t even want to see her! Was he truly going to divorce her? What would happen to her afterward? What would become of the Burgess family?
Just then, her phone rang from her pocket. It was Briley.
That imbecile! Of all the times to call, Briley had to do it when she was at her lowest.
But Hailey managed to gather herself, then picked up the call. “Hello? What’s going on, Briley?”
She acted clueless, even though she already knew Briley’s reason for calling.
Sure enough, Briley exploded on the other end of the line. “Hailey! That bitch Sadie has ruined me!” Her shrill voice was dripping with venom.
“Remember when I was ambushed by reporters outside the police station? I hired people to bury the scandal, but it’s been days, and it’s still going around online! So I had someone look into it, and guess what? It’s that bitch Sadie again! It’s her all along! That despicable woman! I swear, I won’t let her get away with this!”
Briley was so furious that she didn’t even bother to keep her mouth in check.
M d?  g.?
Meanwhile, Hailey’s lips curled into a cold, mocking smile.
Briley really was a fool, through and through. Manipulating her was just a walk in the park.
Little did Briley know that those so-called schemes perpetrated by Sadie were, in fact, masterminded by Hailey herself.
Her goal, of course, was to pit Briley and Sadie against each other until one of them was destroyed.
Hailey sneered, but she masked her disdain with short, pitiful sobs.
“Oh gosh, Briley. That’s… Are you okay?”
“My situation right now…” Hailey began before trailing off with a dramatic exhale. “Sadie, she… She’s already engaged to that spoiled heir from the Higgins family, but she still keeps clinging to Patrick. She has somehow poisoned him against me, and now he wants a divorce. He doesn’t even care about our baby.”noveldrama
Hailey choked on a sob. “I would have been fine with it if it were just me, but my poor child… They aren’t even born yet, and their father is already abandoning them. I just know that once Patrick finalizes our divorce, he will run back to Sadie without a second thought. They would no doubt rekindle their relationship! They will be unstoppable. The entire fortune of the Wall family will fall into their hands. How are we going to survive then?”

Message from Noah: Have a great week dear readers. God loves you and Noah whishes you all the best. ?(?  ? – ? ) ?

###Chapter 961:
Every word that Hailey spoke struck a nerve in Briley, just as she had intended. That last sentence, in particular, succeeded in igniting the rage that had long been festering inside Briley.
Why? Why should that vicious outsider, Sadie, get everything the Wall family had to offer?
And what about her, Briley? Was she destined to be trampled beneath Sadie’s feet, when she had more right to the family fortune?
Her heart burned with resentment.
“No! I will never let that vile wretch have her way!” Briley cried out, her upper lip curling in disdain.
Her tone suddenly turned mysterious as she continued, “Oh, but I have heard something interesting from the grapevine. Apparently, Sadie was hospitalized. I still don’t know the exact reason, but we can use this detail to our advantage, don’t you think?”
The news made Hailey pause. Sadie was ill? Why would she suddenly end up in a hospital?
A vague sense of unease crept into Hailey’s chest, but it was gone in an instant, and she didn’t dwell on it.
Her priority at the moment was to keep her dear pawn in line and make sure she still had Briley’s alliance.
“Briley, darling,” Hailey cooed, her tone concerned. “Whatever you do, don’t be too impulsive! Sadie is the future wife of a Higgins family heir. We can’t go after her…”
Now, or we would just be making trouble for ourselves. It’s best to come up with a foolproof plan before we make our move.”
g?ν.0; ? ?  
By then, however, Briley was too absorbed in her thirst for revenge to listen to reason. She simply couldn’t let another day go by without making Sadie pay for her sins.
“A plan? Yeah, right!” Briley snapped impatiently.
There was one thing she wanted, and one thing only—to punish Sadie, once and for all.
Briley hung up the phone without another word.
Hailey slowly picked herself up from the ground and dusted off her clothes.
She lifted her chin and pulled her shoulders back as her lips curled into a victorious smile. All that was left for her to do now was sit back and watch the drama unfold.
“Let’s see how you handle Briley this time, Sadie!” Hailey muttered under her breath.noveldrama
At the Beversea Grand Hotel,
Briley slumped back on the sofa, still clutching her phone tightly.
That useless, good-for-nothing Hailey! All she ever did was cry and whine, and the most cunning scheme she had ever pulled off was playing the victim to gain people’s sympathy!
If Hailey kept hesitating and second-guessing every suggestion she made, how could they ever accomplish anything significant?
.
.
.
###Chapter 962:
Had Briley known that Hailey was this incompetent, she would have never agreed to join forces with the woman. At first, Hailey only seemed to be a worthless bystander who barely did anything, but now Hailey was actually trying to stop her from acting on her own. What a joke!
It didn’t matter, though. Briley was not to be deterred. She would ensure that Sadie disappeared for good this time around.
Briley’s eyes flashed with cruel intent as she scrolled through her contacts and called a number she hadn’t reached out to in a long time.
“I want Sadie Hudson gone. Feel free to name your price.”
Her order was met with deep, cold laughter. “That’s a rather ambitious request you have, Miss Wall. But money alone will not suffice when you expect me to end a life. More importantly, how do I know this won’t turn out like the last time I did…”
“Something for you? Do you remember how you betrayed me at the last moment?”
Briley shifted in discomfort.
She had indeed betrayed this man back at the banquet that celebrated the partnership between the Wall and Burgess families, all for the sake of impressing Sadie and other guests. She hadn’t expected him to bear a grudge over the incident.
Briley stifled her own irritation and said, “It won’t happen again. You can ask for any compensation you want. As long as you get the job done, I’m open to negotiations.”
There was a hum of satisfaction from the other end, followed by a light chuckle.
“Compensation, you say? What I want is rather simple. I hear you’ve been doing pretty well in the entertainment industry lately. Why don’t you spend some nights with me?”
Briley’s stomach churned at the thought, and it was all she could do not to gag on the spot. This man was utterly disgusting!noveldrama
ЯE P?ΛTΞ? IИ GΛ?И?VΞ.
And yet, she had no choice but to put up with him if she wanted to eliminate Sadie for good.
“Deal. As long as you deliver results, we’ll settle everything else later. Just make sure it’s clean—no mess, no loose ends. I’ll double the payment,” Briley said coolly.
A low chuckle echoed from the other end of the call. “Understood, Miss Wall. Sit tight and wait for the good news.”
Ending the call, Briley leaned back against the sofa. She could feel a trace of dampness clinging to her back, but a sense of relief still crept in. The thought of Sadie finally running into real trouble brought a faint smirk to her lips.
Before she could fully pull herself together, a knock sounded at the door.
Leonard pushed it open a moment later. “Briley, everything’s been arranged. Should we head back to Jazmah today?”
Briley hesitated for a moment. Leaving now might actually be the smarter choice. With her mind a tangled mess and danger lurking nearby, staying would only invite more problems.
Pulling herself together, Briley gave a short nod. “Yeah. Let’s move.”

###Chapter 963:
At Beversea Hospital, Sadie’s recovery had taken steady steps over the past few days, and she had been looking a lot better than before. Feeling less stiff, she decided to try getting up. The instant her feet touched the cold floor, her legs buckled slightly, forcing her to grab the edge of the bed for balance.
“Sadie!” Tina burst into the room, clutching a glass of water that nearly slipped from her fingers the moment she saw Sadie standing. She rushed forward, catching Sadie just in time and helping her carefully back onto the bed.
“You can’t just hop out of bed like that!” Tina scolded, planting her hands on her hips, her cheeks puffed up in frustration. “How many times has the doctor warned you? You’re supposed to be resting! You’re carrying a baby, for crying out loud! Can you please stop making me worry myself sick?”noveldrama
Tina looked like she was about to wear herself out from sheer anxiety. Sadie couldn’t hold back a soft laugh at Tina’s exaggerated expression. She obediently snuggled back under the covers.
“Okay, okay, I get it,” Sadie said with a small, reassuring smile. Her voice was calm as she added, “I’ll be more careful from now on. Promise.”
Only after hearing that did Tina breathe a heavy sigh of relief and place the glass of water down on the nightstand.
Then, as if struck by a sudden memory, Tina smacked her forehead dramatically.
“Ah! I almost forgot! Nathan called earlier! He said he sent something over for you—it should be downstairs by now! I’ll go grab it!”
Before Sadie could even react, Tina had already dashed out of the room like a whirlwind.
“Slow down! It’s not a life-or-death situation,” Sadie called out, laughing quietly as she watched Tina sprint away. The room slipped back into a calm silence once again.
g?ν.0  novels
Drawing in a slow breath, Sadie gently rested her hand on her still-flat stomach. In the past few days, she had begun to truly accept the little life growing inside her.
She already had Averi—her clever, sweet boy. But what if this time it was a girl? A bright, spirited little girl who mirrored her own younger self? Just imagining it filled her heart with warmth. A soft smile touched her lips as her thoughts drifted.
Then, the peaceful moment was broken by the sound of the door creaking open. A nurse, masked and pushing a cart, quietly entered with her head bowed low.
Sadie’s brows pulled together. She was certain she had already received all her medications for the day.
Unease crept over her as she observed the nurse’s movements. The nurse fidgeted nervously, her eyes flickering everywhere as she deliberately avoided meeting Sadie’s gaze.
When the nurse finally spoke, her voice trembled. “Ms. Hudson, the doctor requested an additional dose. I’m here to administer it.”
Sadie stiffened instantly. Something wasn’t right. The nurse’s face was unfamiliar, and her every move felt wrong—forced and shaky. Sadie couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. She was certain she had never seen this nurse before. As the realization hit, a cold wave of unease washed over her.
.

.
###Chapter 964:
“Where’s the nurse who’s been looking after me?” she asked, her voice calm but edged with suspicion.
Fumbling with the supplies on the cart, the woman stiffened, taking an extra second before mumbling her reply.
“Um, Hana had an emergency and had to leave. I’m just filling in for her,” she said, her voice strained and unnatural, still refusing to meet Sadie’s eyes.
As soon as the excuse left her lips, she quickly drew up a syringe and made her way toward the bed.
Sadie’s expression hardened. Hana? That was a lie. Her regular nurse was Lesly, a cheerful, bubbly girl, not someone named Hana. The woman standing in front of her was not a nurse.
Careful not to draw attention, Sadie quietly slid her hand beneath her pillow. Tina had insisted she keep a stun baton hidden there, just in case, and thankfully, she had listened.
The fake nurse, syringe in hand, was trembling more visibly with each step she took.
Before she could get any closer, the door suddenly burst open with a deafening bang.
“Surprise!” Nathan shouted, practically spilling into the room, his arms full of brightly wrapped gifts and a grin plastered across his face. The loud entrance jolted the fake nurse so hard that the syringe nearly slipped from her fingers, her entire body trembling uncontrollably. A flash of panic crossed her face before she abruptly turned, shoved the cart aside, and bolted for the door.noveldrama
Nathan blinked, completely thrown off, and scratched the back of his head. What was happening here?
“Uh, Sadie? What just happened? Why’d the nurse freak out like that?”
gα?ησν?s?com brings your imagination alive
Still tense, Sadie didn’t waste a second. Her eyes darted toward the door, her voice sharp and urgent.
“Don’t just stand there. Go after her! She’s not a nurse!”
Despite usually being carefree, Nathan immediately caught the seriousness in her tone.
“I’m on it!” he said, dropping the stack of gift boxes without hesitation and sprinting out of the room.
The woman hadn’t made it far down the hallway. With his longer strides, Nathan closed the distance effortlessly, grabbing her by the arm and pulling her back with one swift motion.
In the same breath, he ripped the mask off her face. For a moment, Nathan stood frozen in shock. He knew her. It was Ivy Sinclair, one of Ophelia’s personal maids.
Ivy’s knees buckled, and she nearly crumpled to the floor. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she stumbled over her words, her voice trembling with terror.
“Mr. Higgins, please… please. I didn’t want any part of this! It wasn’t my idea! Miss Johnson forced me! I swear, I would never hurt Ms. Hudson on my own!” Ivy cried, her whole body shaking as her expression twisted in panic.
.
.
.
###Chapter 965:
Nathan’s expression darkened immediately, a cold, dangerous rage settling over him.
Ophelia! That woman was slipping deeper into madness by the day. To think she had the nerve to target Sadie in a hospital—it was beyond reckless! Had she completely lost her mind?
If anything happened to Sadie inside Beversea, Nathan knew Patrick wouldn’t just cause a scene—he’d burn the entire city to the ground. But something didn’t sit right. As ruthless as Ophelia was, this kind of careful setup—disguising a maid as a nurse, infiltrating a hospital—felt far too calculated for her alone. The more Nathan thought about it, the more certain he became that Jarrett was involved as well. The two of them were practically begging for a death sentence!
Nathan gazed down at Ivy, who had crumpled to the floor in a trembling heap, his brows creasing into deep furrows. Sadie had caught her red-handed, and the charade had shattered beyond repair.
Ophelia—that snake of a woman—would soon face her reckoning. Yet, on paper at least, she remained Jarrett’s lawful wife. Any scandal would cast a shadow of disgrace over the entire Higgins family.
Nathan found himself in a dilemma.
Just then, Tina emerged from the elevator, a thermos clutched in her hand as she hummed a cheerful melody.noveldrama
She halted abruptly at the sight before her—Nathan gripping the arm of a weeping nurse in the middle of the hospital corridor.
Tina’s feet rooted to the spot as her eyes stretched wide with shock.
What on earth was Nathan doing? Even if his engagement to Sadie existed merely on paper, how dare he carry on with another woman so brazenly—in broad daylight and in a public hospital corridor, no less! Such behavior trampled all over Sadie’s dignity. This betrayal was beyond unconscionable!
Rage bubbled through Tina’s veins as she slammed the thermos down on a nearby surface, her face burning crimson as she marched toward the pair.
Without a moment’s hesitation, she swung her hand and delivered a sharp smack to the back of Nathan’s head. Nathan jerked forward, stunned by the unexpected blow that sent waves of pain throbbing through his skull. Who in God’s name had dared to strike him?
He whirled around, a storm brewing in his chest, only to find himself face-to-face with Tina’s blazing expression.
His fury evaporated in an instant, giving way to utter helplessness.
What twisted reality had he stumbled into? Was everyone in Sadie’s circle so ferocious? First, the stone-faced Patrick, and now this wildfire named Tina.
Tina planted her hands firmly on her hips and jabbed an accusing finger at Nathan.
“How dare you, you worthless cheater! Sadie has shown you nothing but kindness! She just stood up for you, and here you are, canoodling with another woman! What kind of monster treats her this way?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 966:
Realization dawned on Nathan instantly—this was a massive misunderstanding. Tina had completely misconstrued the situation!
Several patients and visitors had paused in their tracks, exchanging whispers and throwing judgmental glances toward the unfolding drama.
“These young people today—absolutely shameless!”
“He has the appearance of decency, but appearances clearly deceive!”
The whispers weren’t particularly loud, but they sliced through the air like invisible daggers.
Nathan’s face flamed crimson with mortification, his toes curling inside his shoes as if trying to burrow through the floor.
“Tina, for heaven’s sake, let me explain!” he pleaded desperately. “You’ve got it all wrong! This isn’t the right place—we need to talk inside!”
He clutched Ivy’s arm firmly while ushering the resistant Tina back toward Sadie’s hospital room.
Unbeknownst to the trio, a man in a baseball cap lurked at the far end of the corridor, partially concealed by the stairwell entrance. His eyes glinted with malicious intrigue as a calculating smile slithered across his face.
What an unexpected revelation—besides Briley, another faction had set their sights on Sadie! And remarkably, they appeared to be related to the Higgins family.
He melted silently into the stairwell, extracted his phone, and punched in Briley’s number with practiced precision.
The connection established almost instantly, Briley’s impatient voice crackling through the speaker. “Report. Was the mission successful?”
“No,” he stated flatly.

Briley’s voice frosted over with irritation. “Then why waste my time with this call? Do you think I’ve nothing better to do?” Her tone suggested she was milliseconds away from terminating the conversation.
“I may have failed the primary ive, but I’ve uncovered something rather intriguing,” the man countered with unruffled composure. “It appears another faction has targeted Sadie. They seem to be connected to the Higgins family. I distinctly caught mention of someone named Ophelia.”noveldrama
Briley’s end of the line went dead silent, the information clearly striking a chord.
Sadie possessed a remarkable talent for cultivating adversaries wherever she ventured. Her character must be truly abhorrent for so many to despise her, each eager to remove her permanently from the equation.
Briley was well acquainted with Ophelia, Jarrett’s fresh bride. She had witnessed their nuptials in Beversea mere days earlier.
A frosty chuckle escaped Briley’s lips. If eager players had already entered the game, why not recline and savor the unfolding spectacle?

###Chapter 967:
“Understood. Monitor their movements closely. When the opportunity presents itself, offer subtle assistance. Ensure that wretched Sadie never sets foot in Jazmah again!”
Having delivered her commands, Briley severed the connection without ceremony.
The man held the phone to his ear, listening to the dead line for a moment before chuckling and shaking his head in amusement. Briley’s naivety amused him greatly. Still, her ignorance served his purposes—it would grant him temporary respite.
He tugged his cap further down, obscuring his features beneath the brim, and slipped from the stairwell with practiced stealth.
Meanwhile, Sadie scrutinized the nurse Nathan had hauled into her room, a subtle crease forming between her brows. The terrified face before her stirred no recognition.
Nathan hovered awkwardly to one side, his mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water, words seemingly trapped in his throat. Tina stood nearby, fury still radiating from her every pore. The sight of Nathan clutching the nurse’s arm rekindled her rage instantly, propelling her to step toward him.
“Nathan Higgins! What in God’s name do you think you’re playing at? You have just announced your engagement to the public, and here you are, parading your mistress through the hospital corridors?”
Pure indignation fueled Tina’s outburst, her words spilling forth unfiltered. In her mind, she had caught Nathan red-handed in his infidelity, exposed before Sadie’s very eyes.
Before Tina could continue her tirade, Sadie’s remarkably composed voice sliced through the tension. “Do you know this woman?”
Sadie looked at Nathan, her eyes silently pressing him for answers.noveldrama
Tina’s scolding was cut off mid-sentence, leaving her staring in stunned confusion. What exactly was that supposed to mean? Had she misunderstood the situation entirely?
Latest updates from g lno vels.
Though a flicker of embarrassment crossed Nathan’s face, he still gave a small nod. There was no point in hiding the truth anymore.
“Her name’s Ivy,” Nathan said, his voice low. “She’s one of Ophelia’s maids.”
The moment the words left his mouth, Ivy collapsed to her knees, bowing so low her forehead nearly touched the floor.
“Please, Ms. Hudson, I’m begging you! It wasn’t my idea! Miss Johnson forced me into this! She said if I refused, she’d kill my entire family! I swear, I didn’t want to hurt you! Please, show mercy and let me go!”
Tina’s eyes grew wide with disbelief. A maid disguising herself as a nurse? This wasn’t some impulsive act; this was a carefully planned attack!
Turning toward Sadie, Tina asked, “Sadie, are you okay? Did she hurt you?”
Sadie calmly placed a hand over Tina’s, a quiet gesture urging her to stay composed.
Fortunately, Nathan had shown up just in time to derail the plot. If he hadn’t, the consequences would’ve been unthinkable.

###Chapter 968:
Sadie lifted her gaze, her expression steady and composed. “So, what’s your plan for dealing with this?”
Nathan’s face darkened, a storm brewing behind his eyes. Every instinct in him screamed to make Ophelia and Jarrett pay, but the weight of the Higgins family’s reputation kept him in check.
After a brief pause, he chose his words carefully. “Sadie, believe me, there’s nothing I want more than to take down Ophelia and Jarrett. But bringing this into the public spotlight would only hurt the Higgins family in the end.”
He studied Sadie carefully, searching for any sign of disapproval. “Do you think we can settle this without making a scene?”
Sadie wasn’t the least bit surprised. She had already considered the same risks. Getting the authorities involved would turn this into a media circus, and worse, her
Pregnancy would become public knowledge, throwing all her carefully laid plans into chaos.
A faint, cool smile curved her lips. “Keeping it quiet suits me just fine. In fact, we might not even need to lift a finger.”noveldrama
She let the words hang for a moment, her message clear. “All we have to do is explain to your father exactly what happened here today.” Rodger might have his biases, but when it came to matters that affected the family’s foundation, he never let anything slide. There was no way he’d allow Jarrett and Ophelia to threaten the Higgins family.
Nathan caught on immediately. Sadie was proposing they let his father handle Jarrett and Ophelia. That way, they could eliminate the threats, shield the Higgins family’s reputation, and stay out of the crossfire themselves.
The brilliance of it struck Nathan instantly. Sadie’s sharp instincts left him genuinely impressed. He found himself quietly admiring her.
?    —  ? ν﹒
“I get it,” he said, nodding solemnly. “I was careless, and you ended up in danger. I’ll tighten security here right away. The hospital will be on lockdown. No one’s getting near you again.”
Sadie gave a small shake of her head. “There’s no need to go that far.” Her hand brushed lightly over her abdomen, a tenderness softening her eyes. “Things in Beversea are nearly settled. I’m planning to head back to Jazmah.” Staying here any longer would only invite more trouble.
Nathan gave a firm nod. Heading back to Jazmah, where the Wall family held influence, was definitely safer for her than lingering in Beversea. Plus, with Patrick overseeing things, Sadie would be in much better hands.
“Sounds like a solid plan,” he said. “I’ll make sure you get there quickly and without any problems.” He pulled out his phone, ready to start making arrangements.
“Hold on.” Sadie raised a hand, stopping him. “They’re not going to back down after today. Instead of waiting for them to strike again, let’s flip the script. Spread the word. I’ll be leaving the hospital at eight tomorrow morning, heading to Jazmah via the highway.”
Nathan blinked, surprised for a second, but quickly pieced it together. Sadie wasn’t planning to leave quietly. She was setting a trap, using her departure as bait to draw out anyone still plotting against her. Now that was a clever move!
.

###Chapter 969:
A grin tugged at the corner of Nathan’s mouth, a flicker of excitement sparking in his eyes. “Understood! I’m on it!” he said, already buzzing with energy.
Without hesitation, Nathan turned around and headed for the door. Before leaving, he pulled Ivy off the floor like she weighed nothing, dragging her out of the room. The soft click of the door echoed behind them.
Tina stood frozen for a moment, still visibly rattled, worry and confusion etched across her face.
“Sadie, why would Ophelia and Jarrett go after you together? I thought they couldn’t stand each other. What’s making them team up all of a sudden?”
Sadie’s hand drifted to her stomach, her fingers resting lightly as a faint, knowing smile appeared. “Even enemies can work together when they share a common goal. Ophelia’s probably coming after me because of Nathan. As for Jarrett…” Her voice grew sharper, colder. “He likely sees this child as a threat to his position in the Higgins family.”
In their eyes, the baby, believed to be Nathan’s, would strengthen Nathan’s claim to the Higgins Group, something Jarrett would never allow without a fight.
Still, Sadie wasn’t about to waste more energy worrying about Jarrett and Ophelia’s schemes. Bigger priorities demanded her attention now.
Straightening her shoulders, Sadie fixed her gaze on Tina, her tone shifting to something more decisive. “Let’s forget about them for now. Tina, there’s something important I need your help with.”noveldrama
The study at the Higgins Manor bathed in afternoon light.
Rodger’s weathered face glowed with unmistakable joy, his eyes crinkling at the corners.
In his weathered hands, he cradled a glossy catalog of enchanting baby items—delicate silver bracelets, miniature clothes, and impossibly tiny shoes.
M?г? ?  l?l?.
Every few moments, his fingers would trace over a particular item that he had already bought, bringing it closer to his face for inspection, a smile spreading across his lips with unstoppable delight.
The thought of Sadie’s unborn child—his precious grandchild nestled safely in her womb—swelled his heart with profound contentment and anticipation.
This innocent life represented the future of the Higgins family, the living embodiment of their pride and the continuation of their storied legacy.
The more this reality settled into his consciousness, the broader his grin stretched, etching deeper lines into his already weathered face.
Just then, the heavy oak study door creaked open from the outside, creating just enough space for a sliver of hallway light to spill across the carpet.
A head slipped through the gap, furtive and wary, revealing Nathan’s apprehensive features.
Rodger’s smile evaporated like morning dew under harsh sunlight, replaced by furrowed brows and tightened lips.
.
.
.
###Chapter 970:noveldrama
At the sight of Nathan’s shifty demeanor, Rodger’s heart plummeted into his stomach. His son’s secretive approach never heralded anything positive.
He reluctantly placed the silver baby bracelet back onto the polished mahogany desk, shadows gathering across his expression.
“What brings you skulking back here? Shouldn’t you be at the hospital attending to Ms. Hudson?” he demanded, suspicion lacing every syllable.
Nathan forced an uncomfortable chuckle, nudging the door wider with his shoulder before slipping inside with uncharacteristic hesitation.
As the door swung completely open, it revealed a young woman hovering anxiously behind Nathan, her head bowed in submission. The nurse’s uniform draped…
Awkwardly on her slender frame, the nurse’s uniform draped, while every aspect of her demeanor betrayed profound discomfort and a sense of not belonging.
Rodger’s brow creased into deep crevices as a horrifying suspicion ignited in his mind. Could this timid creature be yet another woman entangled in his son’s web of dalliances?
His heart stuttered painfully as white-hot rage flooded his chest. Without a moment’s deliberation, he launched from his chair, marched purposefully to the door, and slammed it with such force that the surrounding wall trembled before hastily engaging the lock with a decisive click.
Spinning back to face his visitors, he dropped his voice to a dangerous whisper. “Ms. Hudson doesn’t know, does she?”
What an utterly worthless excuse for a son! Sadie’s womb cradled his unborn child, and yet Nathan still possessed the audacity to philander and parade another woman at their family home?
Rodger’s blood boiled with uncontainable fury, his pulse hammering in his temples. Was this ungrateful, rebellious spawn deliberately attempting to expedite his father’s journey to the cemetery?
  ?: gν﹒
Nathan staggered backward, blindsided by the venom in his father’s accusation, his thoughts scrambling to make sense of the situation. What bizarre scenario had his father constructed?
Before Nathan could piece it together, Rodger, trembling with barely contained rage, swung his arm upward and delivered a resounding smack to the back of his son’s head.
Nathan flinched violently and clutched his throbbing skull. “Dad! What possible justification do you have for striking me?”
Rodger’s gnarled hands quivered with unbridled fury. “I should thoroughly thrash you within an inch of your miserable life, you ungrateful wretch! How dare you take advantage of Ms. Hudson’s vulnerable pregnant state by cavorting with another woman? And to compound your treachery by bringing this… this temptress into our home! Have you considered the consequences if Ms. Hudson discovers this betrayal? Have you?”
Each accusatory word that escaped Rodger’s lips fanned the flames of his indignation higher, constricting his chest with such intensity that breathing became laborious. This disgraceful specimen he had sired appeared utterly beyond redemption!
.
.
.
###Chapter 971:
Nathan stood paralyzed in disbelief, his jaw working soundlessly before finding his voice. “Dad! What preposterous scenario has your imagination conjured?”
Massaging the tender spot on his skull with obvious indignation, he jabbed an urgent finger toward the cowering woman beside him. “She is Ophelia’s maid…”
Before the explanation could fully materialize, Rodger’s palm whistled through the air and connected with the other side of Nathan’s head with even greater ferocity.
This second assault, delivered with increased vigor, sent shockwaves of pain radiating through Nathan’s skull, contorting his features into a mask of agony.
Rodger had transcended mere anger, his complexion darkening to an alarming shade as veins bulged prominently at his temples. His voice quavered with unbridled emotion. “You embody nothing but disgrace to our family name! Complete and utter disgrace!”
He pounded his fist against his chest repeatedly, the physical manifestation of his spiritual anguish, his features crumpling under the crushing weight of perceived betrayal.
“Your behavior defies comprehension! Entangled romantically with Ophelia’s maid? Have you contemplated the volcanic eruption Ophelia will unleash when this information reaches her ears? If word gets out, how will our family show our face in public?”
In Rodger’s mind, this revelation constituted nothing short of an apocalyptic disaster. Among all the potential paramours in existence, his son had selected Ophelia’s personal servant! Should Sadie detect even a whiff of this betrayal, would their planned nuptials survive such treachery? Would she maintain any desire to nurture the precious Higgins heir growing within her?
Anxiety consumed Rodger so completely that his body could no longer remain stationary, propelling him into frenzied circular patterns across the expensive Persian carpet.noveldrama

No, Sadie must remain forever ignorant of this transgression. Or, perhaps he should hasten to the hospital this instant, preemptively confess the situation, offer profuse apologies, and implore her forgiveness? He could fabricate some narrative about Nathan’s temporary confusion, pledging such behavior would never recur.
Nathan observed his father’s apocalyptic meltdown with a mixture of incredulity and mounting frustration. The sheer absurdity of this misunderstanding bordered on the surreal. What bizarre narratives had been fermenting in his father’s overactive imagination?
“Dad! You’ve misinterpreted everything!” He lunged forward, seizing Rodger’s shoulders with desperate urgency. “Ophelia dispatched Ivy to the hospital with malicious intent toward Sadie! This woman infiltrated the hospital masquerading as a nurse and attempted to inject Sadie with an unidentified substance. I intercepted her intervention mere seconds before disaster!”
Rodger’s entire body petrified mid-stride, color gradually receding from his features. He remained immobilized in shocked suspension for what seemed an eternity before exhaling a prolonged, shuddering breath of profound relief. At least, his son had not violated his commitment to Sadie.
.

###Chapter 972:
However, mere heartbeats later, Rodger’s eyes expanded to saucer-like proportions, clarity crashing through his consciousness as the genuine horror of Nathan’s revelation finally penetrated his understanding.
He lunged forward, fingers digging painfully into Nathan’s forearm with vice-like intensity, his voice escalating with each word. “What did you say? That contemptible Ophelia orchestrated an attack on Ms. Hudson through this accomplice?”
Blood surged violently through Rodger’s arteries, pounding in his ears as incandescent rage consumed his rational thought. That serpentine Ophelia with her poisonous schemes! Such unmitigated audacity! Sadie’s precious womb sheltered the future heir of the Higgins family! What depraved mentality could conceive such an abhorrent assault against an innocent child?noveldrama
Tremors of uncontrollable fury rippled through Rodger’s frame as he pivoted sharply, his scorching gaze locking onto Ivy’s shrinking form. With purposeful strides that shook the floorboards, he closed the distance and roughly extracted her from behind Nathan.
“Confess immediately!” he thundered, towering over her trembling figure. “Reveal every detail of this scheme! Was it that serpent Ophelia?”
Rodger’s glare burned with such fury that it looked like he might tear Ivy apart on the spot.
Overcome by fear, Ivy fell to the floor with a loud thud.
Tears spilled down her face as she dropped to her knees, trembling.
“Sir, please! I am begging you! It was not just Miss Johnson’s idea. Jarrett was involved too! They both threatened me! They said if I didn’t cooperate, they’d destroy my whole family! I had no choice! Please, just this once, have mercy!” She sobbed so hard that it left her gasping, her forehead raw from pressing it against the floor.
Her words struck Rodger like a jolt of lightning. He stumbled back, his face draining of all color. Nathan watched him with a glint of satisfaction. Ivy was proving smarter than he thought.
 ? ? g?ν．
On the way back, he had only hinted that she should mention the pressure from Jarrett and Ophelia.
He had also promised that if she helped, her family would stay safe.
So far, everything was falling into place.
Rodger turned to him, searching for something to cling to. “Does Ms. Hudson know about this?”
His heart sank. He could not understand it; how could Jarrett, who had always been so steady, team up with Ophelia to pull such a reckless stunt?
And to target Sadie, of all people—the head of Wall Group and the mother of the Higgins family’s future heir.
Nathan watched the panic flicker in his father’s eyes, a cold smirk tugging at his mouth. Even now, all Rodger cared about was Jarrett.
Outwardly, he kept his face etched with grief.
.
.
.
###Chapter 973:
“Dad, I had no choice. Sadie told me to bring Ivy back. She said this is a Higgins family matter and we should handle it ourselves. Otherwise…” He let the words hang heavy in the air. “Sadie said she would take care of it herself.”
That was the final blow. Rodger looked as if he might collapse, his face even paler than before.
With Sadie’s power behind Wall Group, if she decided to move against them, the Higgins family would not stand a chance.
Rodger’s mind spun, scrambling to measure what could still be saved. He had always leaned toward Jarrett—steady, capable, the son he had imagined would lead the family one day.
But when weighed against the future of the Higgins name, what was one son?
What was the Johnson family’s favor worth when Sadie’s wrath hung overhead?
Survival came first. His hesitation barely lasted a breath.
Grinding his teeth like a man dragging himself through mud, he slammed his palm against the mahogany table. The crack rang out across the study.
“This is outrageous! That witch Ophelia must have dragged Jarrett into this!”
He stormed to his desk and jabbed the intercom button. “Tell Trey to come to my study. Now!”
Within minutes, Trey Watts, the butler, entered and stood silently at the side.
Rodger’s face darkened. “Send Ophelia back to her own home right away! Tell her she needs to apologize to Ms. Hudson in person at the hospital! And find Daren! He needs to see what his precious sister has done!”
Trey stiffened but answered without pause, “Yes, sir.”
g?lnσν?s?com is your escape to fiction
Rodger’s gaze shifted to Ivy, who was still trembling on the floor. He waved her off like swatting away a fly. “Lock this maid in the storage room for now.”
He turned his mind back to Jarrett.
He frowned in deep thought. When he spoke again, his voice came quieter, like an old door easing shut, “As for Jarrett, keep him confined to his room for three days. Let him think hard about what he has done.”
Nathan almost laughed out loud. Three days of confinement? It was a joke. His father’s favoritism toward Jarrett had always been laughable—if it were not so sad, it might have been funny. Still, getting rid of Ophelia was a small win.noveldrama
He sneered inwardly but kept his face as blank as a sheet of paper.
“Dad, there’s no need for the apology,” he said lazily. “Sadie’s flying to Jazmah tomorrow. She probably doesn’t have time to meet Ophelia.”
Rodger hesitated for a moment before nodding. That was likely for the best.
Already thinking ahead, he said quickly, “Since Ms. Hudson is leaving tomorrow, you will come with me to the hospital to see her off.” He thought it would be a good way to patch things up and show Sadie where their loyalty stood.
.

.
###Chapter 974:
Nathan stretched and let out a long yawn, as if he could not care less. “I’m dead tired. If that’s everything, Dad, I’m heading to bed.” Nathan turned and strolled out without waiting for a reply.
Rodger stood there, watching the easy slouch of his son’s retreating figure, his anger bubbling just under the surface.
Compared to his steady, dependable elder son, Rodger thought this rebellious younger one must have been born just to test his patience.
Rodger pointed at Nathan’s retreating figure with a trembling hand. “You… You imbecile!”
He was so furious that he slammed his fist against the table.
Meanwhile, downstairs in Jarrett’s suite, Ophelia was sitting at her dressing table, methodically removing her makeup as her anxiety continued to spike.
All of a sudden, the door burst open.
Trey barged into the room, flanked by two burly servants, his face blank.
Ophelia jumped up in fright. “What do you think you’re doing?”
Trey gave a slight bow, but his tone was icy when he spoke. “With all due respect, Mr. Rodger Higgins has ordered you to pack your things and return to your original home immediately.”
Ophelia felt all the color drain from her face. “What are you talking about? Why is he sending me back home?”
She had endured so much just to become the wife of a disabled man. She had been humiliated at her own wedding for goodness’ sake, and now her father-in-law was throwing her out? There was no way she was letting that happen!
A flicker of disdain crossed Trey’s eyes. “Have you forgotten what you’ve done?” he asked, his voice carrying a subtle edge. “Ms. Hudson has already sent Ivy back.”
Your next story starts here: g?lnσνs?com
Ophelia froze, even as a chill raced down her spine.
Did that mean Ivy had failed? The cursed child inside Sadie’s belly was still safe?
Ophelia’s mind raced as she wondered who might have thwarted her plans. It had to be Sadie! That troublesome bitch was the only one who could have caused all this!
But Trey didn’t have time to waste on Ophelia’s distress. When she still didn’t move, he motioned at the servants, who quickly rushed forward and seized Ophelia by the arms.
“Let go of me! What are you doing? No, I’m not leaving! I’d rather die than be sent back home!” Ophelia screamed and struggled desperately. Unfortunately, she was no match against the two men, and before long, she found herself being dragged out of the premises.
An hour later, Trey escorted Ophelia into the Johnson family’s estate, her hands bound tightly behind her back.noveldrama
The servants were naturally shocked at what they were seeing, but they lowered their heads and pretended to be busy, contenting themselves with sneaking glances.
.
.

###Chapter 975:
What happened to Ophelia? Why did it seem like she had been forcefully brought back to her family home?
More importantly, the butler of the Higgins family had a grim look on his face. What could have possibly happened over at the Higgins Manor?
Although curious and confused, they knew better than to voice their questions.
Trey shoved Ophelia into the living room.
Daren was there, his brows furrowed slightly as he pored over a report. Ophelia saw her chance. All of the resentment she had been bottling up at her in-laws’ exploded all at once.
She whipped around and glared at Trey. Her brother was here, and this was their home. What did she have to fear?
“Daren!” she cried out, her voice thick with emotion. “Tell this lowly servant to let go of me!”
Daren looked up sharply, his frown deepening. He took a moment to process the sight before him—his sister, held down by two of the Higgins family’s servants, her hands obviously tied behind her back, her face twisted in misery.
Daren’s expression darkened. They were in the Johnson family’s territory!
How dare they treat his sister like this?
He slammed the report on the coffee table and rose to his feet.
The Higgins family had gone too far this time. Just what did they take Ophelia and the rest of the Johnson family for? Jarrett might be the one in charge of the Higgins family at present, but that gave him no right to abuse Ophelia!
“What is the meaning of this?” Daren demanded, his voice sharp with indignation. “Do you think you can just bully the Johnson family as you like?”
  ? ?
Trey didn’t bat an eye, but he allowed himself a cold, humorless smile. He even offered a small bow.
“Please calm down, Mr. Johnson. The Higgins family harbors no such ill will. However, what your sister has done may require some reflection on your part.”noveldrama
Daren’s heart skipped a beat, his anger subsiding ever so slightly.
What did Trey mean?
He turned his gaze to his sister.
Ophelia’s panic was evident. She frantically shook her head, her tears streaming freely down her cheeks. “I didn’t do anything!”
At that point, Daren’s lips were set into a hard line. It seemed that the situation was more complicated than he had initially thought. After seeing his sister’s panic and Trey’s resolve, he stifled his outrage and tried to assess the matter from a clear perspective.
“Ophelia, tell me the truth,” Daren said in a softer tone. “What exactly did you do?”
Ophelia’s heart sank into an abyss. Her brother didn’t believe her… Was he about to side with the Higgins family and condemn her as well? A fresh wave of frustration surged within her.
.
.
.
###Chapter 976:
“I told you, I didn’t do anything!” she said, almost screaming now. “It’s all Sadie’s fault! She brought it on herself! She deserved it!”
Daren let out a long exhale. Just like that, he understood everything.
His spoiled, reckless sister had no doubt targeted Sadie.
What a fool!
Had she forgotten who Sadie was? She was the head of the Wall Group, someone they could never afford to cross! How could Ophelia try to harm Sadie?
Still, the Higgins family had simply sent Ophelia back instead of punishing her, so that must mean Sadie was unharmed.
Daren breathed a sigh of relief at that. Thank God for small blessings. At least things hadn’t devolved into utter disaster.
Otherwise, it wouldn’t just be the Higgins family they would have to deal with, but the Wall Group as well. And the Johnson family might not survive that fate.
Thinking quickly, Daren plastered a look of regret on his face. “Trey, please accept my sincerest apologies for my attitude earlier. I was rude and careless…”
“My sister acted without thinking, and I apologize for any trouble she has caused the Higgins family and Ms. Hudson. Is there anything Mr. Rodger Higgins needs from us?” Daren said.noveldrama
Trey raised an eyebrow. The sudden change in Daren’s demeanor sparked a flicker of disdain within him.
Daren certainly knew how to adapt to situations as they occurred. It was unfortunate that his sister was his complete opposite.
“Mr. Higgins has asked that you come to the Higgins Manor right away. Ms. Hudson is not feeling well and will be leaving for Jazmah early tomorrow morning. Mr. Higgins would like to discuss the arrangements for her departure with you.”
Magic begins at g α? ησ ν s?com
Trey paused to shoot a cold, scornful glance at Ophelia, who was still sobbing uncontrollably.
“As for your sister, I regret to inform you that the Higgins family cannot accept someone like her. It is Mr. Higgins’s hope that you closely monitor her moving forward, so that she doesn’t cause any more problems in the future.”
With those words, he had practically declared the end of Ophelia’s marriage to Jarrett.
A ball of dread settled in the pit of Daren’s stomach. Had he misheard Trey? How could this be happening?
The Johnson family was in desperate need of the Higgins family’s support. This marriage alliance was crucial to their survival.
Regardless of what Ophelia had done, she was clearly at fault. But Daren couldn’t let her foolishness ruin the relationship between the two families and ultimately foil the Johnson family’s interests.
Daren forced a more contrite smile.
.
.
.
###Chapter 977:
“Yes, yes, of course. You’re absolutely right. My sister made a huge mistake, and it is a failure on our part as her family. Rest assured, I will see to it that she is properly disciplined for her actions. I will not allow her to mess things up again!”
Ophelia could hardly believe what she was hearing.noveldrama
Had her brother really agreed to the Higgins family’s outrageous demands? Not only that, but he was vowing to discipline her, too? What had she even done wrong? Why should she be punished?
It was Sadie who had stolen Nathan from her, and it was Sadie who had poisoned the Higgins family into throwing her out! If anything, she was the victim here.
“Daren!” Ophelia cried out, her face a mask of shock and disbelief. “How can you say that? What did I do wrong? Why should I suffer? Sadie is the one who—”
The rest of her words died in her throat as a sharp slap echoed through the room.
Daren had swung his arm and delivered the blow himself, using enough force to leave her momentarily stunned.
His eyes were narrowed into slits, and his face was flushed with rage. “Enough! Haven’t you embarrassed us enough already? Look at the mess you’ve made! From now on, you will stay at home and reflect on your actions! I will deal with you when I get back!”
With that, Daren looked away, straightened his suit jacket, and nodded at Trey. “Let’s go.”
Trey nodded in acknowledgment and followed Daren out the door.
A pregnant silence fell over the living room at their departure. Ophelia was left trembling where she stood, while a few servants milled around without a single peep.
Ophelia was seething, her entire body consumed by anger and hatred. That bitch Sadie! The despicable Higgins family! And now, even her treacherous brother! They were all against her! Then a thought struck Ophelia—Trey had mentioned that Sadie was leaving tomorrow. Maybe this was her chance! She wasn’t about to let Sadie go without a fight!
G a lno ve ls . com is where the magic begins
The next day, at Beversea Hospital, the door to Sadie’s ward opened quietly.
Tina walked in, her pace brisk. “Sadie, everything has been set up just as you asked.” Although her voice was hushed, she couldn’t quite hide her excitement.
Sadie was standing by the window. After hearing Tina’s report, she slowly turned around, grabbed the trench coat draped over the chair, and threw it over her shoulders. “Thank you.”
She had made up her mind to finally exterminate the villains hiding in the shadows. Every secret would be laid bare.
The two women exited the hospital room and took the elevator downstairs.
A group of people was waiting for them at the entrance to the inpatient department.
Rodger stood at the forefront, with Nathan next to him. Daren hung back behind them, looking stiff and awkward.
.
.
.
###Chapter 978:noveldrama
Rodger hurried forward to greet Sadie. He nervously rubbed his hands together in an attempt to look humble and repentant.
The fact that Sadie was willing to settle this matter privately was a huge boon to the Higgins family, and he knew he needed to show her the proper respect that came with her benevolence.
“Ms. Hudson, we sincerely regret any shortcomings in our hospitality during your stay. We’d like to extend our deepest apologies for any oversight.”
Daren quickly followed suit, his expression even more reverent as he bowed to Sadie.
The Johnson family couldn’t afford to lose the Higgins family’s support, and he couldn’t let his sister’s stupidity destroy any chance they might have.
“Indeed, Ms. Hudson. My sister is young and brash. She made a huge mistake, and I cannot thank you enough for not holding it against her. I assure you, she will face the consequences for her foolishness. I will personally make sure that nothing like this happens again!”
Sadie looked back and forth between the two men, each with their own agenda. A small smile tugged at her lips, though it didn’t reach her eyes.
“Gentlemen, I appreciate you coming here to see me off. It’s all in the past now.”
She paused to sweep her gaze over them again. “However,” she continued, her tone icy now, “I hope that you both learn to curb your arrogance and avoid creating such problems in the future.”
Daren’s smile faltered, and he found himself shuddering at Sadie’s words.
Did she already know everything?
His heart skipped a beat, but he masked his alarm by lowering his head further. “Yes, of course, Ms. Hudson. I will take your advice to heart.”
 ?ρ ν
Nathan glanced at his watch and said, “Dad, it’s getting late. We shouldn’t keep Ms. Hudson any longer.”
He walked to the car parked in the hospital driveway and opened the door to the back seat.
Without another word, Sadie strode past Rodger and Daren and got into the car, with Tina close at her heels.
Nathan slammed the car door shut.
Rodger and Daren stood side by side, wearing identical smiles as they waved Sadie off.
It wasn’t until the car had completely disappeared from view that Rodger finally dropped the facade.
Daren approached him cautiously. “Mr. Higgins, about Ophelia’s marriage to Jarrett…”
He trailed off when he saw Rodger scowl. Clearly, the old man was not pleased.
Who could blame him? Ophelia had nearly destroyed the Higgins family, and Daren still dared to hold on to that blasted marriage alliance?
.

###Chapter 979:
“Let’s leave that for later,” Rodger said impatiently, dismissing Daren with a wave of his hand before turning toward his own car.
Daren’s smile froze at the obvious snub.
Nathan had been standing to the side, watching everything unfold. He couldn’t resist clicking his tongue.
Daren had it coming.
But he wasn’t interested in Daren’s fate, so he, too, walked to his sports car.
Nathan was just about to get in when he noticed a black car in the distance. Its unmarked appearance gave him pause at first, then it started moving.
It was headed in the same direction that Sadie’s car had left.
Nathan hesitated, his brows furrowing. Was he being paranoid? Something about that car didn’t feel right.
But he shook his head in the next second. He was likely overthinking things.
He bent and slid behind the wheel, only to spot a thick manila envelope sitting in the passenger seat.
It was the latest supplementary agreement with the Wall Group, the one he had brought from the office yesterday.
Damn it! He was supposed to hand it over to Sadie before she left.
Nathan slapped his forehead and heaved a weary sigh.
He’d been so caught up in the drama and farewells that he had forgotten something so important!
If he returned it to the company as it was and the board found out, they would definitely kick up a fuss. They would accuse him of being incompetent, having failed to handle the simplest of tasks.

And then, of course, his dear older brother would find a way to somehow make things worse. No, Nathan couldn’t let that happen!
Sadie’s car shouldn’t have gone too far. If he floored it, he might still catch up to her.
Nathan didn’t think twice. He started the engine and stepped on the gas.
Meanwhile, inside the black Maybach, Sadie sat back with her eyes closed, feeling relaxed.
The vehicle slowed slightly upon reaching the intersection, and another car came into view from a nearby ramp.
It was completely identical to the one they were in—the model, the color, even the license plate.
Sadie cracked her eyes open just a bit to glance outside the window. The second car glided into the traffic, heading toward the highway that led back to Jazmah.
Meanwhile, the car she was in quietly changed lanes after passing the intersection, and they were now on their way to Beversea Airport.noveldrama

###Chapter 980:
Everything was going according to plan.
An hour later, at Beversea Airport, the stairs to the private jet slowly folded into the aircraft, and the door was secured.
Soon, the aircraft was taxiing down the runway and lifting off into the sky.
The city gradually shrank below them.
As the plane climbed to a particular altitude, it flew over the highway. Sadie’s gaze fell on a specific spot, where thick, black smoke rose from roaring flames.
A vehicle was burning on the highway.
Her lips curled into a sly smile.
Beside her, Tina also noticed the scene. She couldn’t resist leaning over to get a proper view.
“Sadie, your plan was brilliant! You’ve led them all down the wrong path, and now they’ve fallen into their own trap! All that’s left is for them to tear each other apart. You quite literally killed two birds with one stone! Genius!”
Sadie looked away and pulled the window shade down, instantly dimming the cabin.
She shifted into a more comfortable position, closed her eyes, and started to doze off.
Unbeknownst to her, Nathan had shown up on the scene shortly after the decoy car caught fire.
He slammed on the brakes, jumped out of his car, and stared in horror as the Maybach was engulfed in flames. For one tense moment, it was all he could do.
That was Sadie’s car! How did things turn out this way?
He descended into a panic. If something happened to Sadie, everything he had worked for would come crashing down. Patrick would never forgive him, and the Higgins family would be finished!

The impending aftermath spurred Nathan into action, and he rushed toward the blazing vehicle. “Sadie! Sadie!”
But the fire was too intense, the heat too scorching. It wasn’t possible to get any closer.
The flames crackled as they continued to devour the car. There was no way anyone inside could survive that.
Nathan’s face went deathly pale, and he felt cold all over, as if he had fallen into hell himself.
He was overcome with fear. This couldn’t be real!
With trembling hands, he fumbled for his phone and struggled to dial the fire department’s number. “Hello? Hello! You need to hurry! Someone’s trapped in a burning car! It’s on Jeswiador Road! It’s a black car! It’s burning, and someone is still inside! Please hurry!”
He had just hung up when a sudden realization hit him. A small flicker of hope lit up inside his chest.

###Chapter 981:
He always kept a fire extinguisher in the trunk of his sports car! It wasn’t much, but it was better than nothing!
He ran back to his car and clumsily grabbed the fire extinguisher before darting back to the fire.
But his small, portable extinguisher did little to put out the fiery flames. It was like trying to put out a bonfire with a squirt gun—the flames barely wavered.
Nathan’s heart thundered furiously. He was desperate now.
Thankfully, he finally heard the sirens approaching from the distance. When he turned in their direction, he saw several fire trucks roaring down the highway.
The firefighters were quick and efficient, and they managed to control the fire in just a matter of minutes.
Nathan stood behind the safety line, anxiously waiting for news. It took an hour to completely put out the fire. At that point, all that was left of the car was its bare bones.
A handful of firefighters slowly and carefully inspected the wreckage.
Nathan watched in tense silence, his heart already in his throat. After a while, the fire captain walked up to him, looking utterly bewildered.
“We didn’t find any bodies inside the car, sir.”
Nathan froze. His heart stuttered.
What? Then what had he been running around for, terrified out of his mind?
Where the hell was Sadie?
Despite the car’s charred condition, it was still recognizable enough that he knew it was the one she had used.
Nathan frowned and stared at his feet, his mind racing.
gα?ησν?s?com has stories worth exploring
Then a brief conversation from yesterday flashed in his mind. Sadie had asked him to tell everyone that she would be taking the highway back to Jazmah this morning.
The truth dawned on him, and he could only smack his forehead in frustration. How had he not thought of that?
Nathan closed his eyes and let out a heavy sigh of relief. Then he chuckled in admiration. That woman was something else, all right.
All of a sudden, a voice in the back of his mind told him to look around. Right then, a black car sped down the highway next to the lane of the burnt car.
Wasn’t that the same car he had seen back at the hospital? What was it doing here?noveldrama
Nathan felt a twinge of suspicion. Could this unmarked car be connected to the incident?
Meanwhile, in the back seat of the car in question, a bodyguard took out his phone and made a call. The line connected after two rings.
“Hello?” Ophelia answered, sounding quite agitated.
The bodyguard lowered his voice. “Miss, it’s done. I saw it with my own eyes—the car is practically burned to ashes. There’s no way anyone could have survived.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 982:
Ophelia’s heart soared when she heard that. Sadie was finally dead? At long last!
It was a huge weight lifted off her shoulders. There was no one left to get in her way! The position of Nathan’s wife was now empty, and Ophelia was more than ready to take it. Nathan would finally be hers! That wretched Sadie got what she deserved. It was her karma for stealing Nathan from her!
“Good job!” Ophelia exclaimed, unable to contain her excitement. “Book the first flight out of the country and lie low for a while. I will transfer the rest of the payment to your account later.”
The bodyguard grinned greedily. “As you wish, Miss. You can count on me. I made sure there are no loose ends.”
He was pretty chuffed when he hung up. This assignment had been easy money, after all. He hadn’t even lifted a finger!
He had simply tailed the car as he was instructed. Who could have known that it would catch fire on its own?
Well, they got what was coming to them!
He didn’t care about any of that. All that mattered to him was the hefty sum he was getting out of this contract.
In the dressing room backstage of a prestigious event in Beversea, Briley had just gotten off the phone.
The call had come from someone she had hired to keep track of Sadie. He had just reported that Sadie was dead. Her car had been burned to a crisp while driving down the highway to Jazmah.
Briley gripped her phone so tightly that her knuckles turned white. It was all she could do not to break out in triumphant laughter.
The best reads are at g?lnσνs?c?m
Finally! That detestable woman was gone for good! The Wall Group was now hers! She was about to become the head of the company, and no one would be able to question her eligibility!
Briley rose to her feet and grabbed her coat.
Just then, Leonard opened the door and stepped inside, only to pause when he noticed that she was about to leave.
He hurried over, saying, “The event is about to start. Shouldn’t we wait until it’s over before—”noveldrama
He was abruptly cut off by a loud slap across his face.
Briley didn’t bother to mask her arrogance. “What kind of event is this? As the future CEO of the Wall Group, why should I waste my time on something so insignificant?”
She lifted her chin and huffed. “Go get the car. I’m heading back to Wall Manor right this instant. And call all the family elders. Tell them I have an important announcement to make.”
Leonard could barely keep up with everything—first the slap, and now her odd orders.
.
.
.
###Chapter 983:noveldrama
She was returning to Wall Manor? She wanted him to call the family elders?
And… The future CEO of Wall Group? What did that even mean?
Had something happened to Sadie?
Leonard touched his burning cheek, overcome with confusion and disbelief. He stared at Briley, who seemed to have transformed into a completely different person.
No, Briley had completely lost her mind.
But currently, he really had no choice but to follow her orders.
Leonard stifled his shock and gave a slight bow. “Understood.”
Later, in Wall Manor, the heavy wooden doors of the meeting hall were pushed open. Inside, the family elders were already gathered around a long table, each of them looking tired and impatient. Some were even yawning.
This was an ungodly hour for a family meeting. What could Briley possibly be up to now?
Seated at the head of the table, Jonah was the most irritable of them all. He looked up at Briley’s arrival, his brows drawn into a scowl. “Briley! What’s all this about? Why did you drag us old folks here all of a sudden?”
Briley braced herself and plastered a look of profound sorrow on her face. She even reached up to wipe nonexistent tears from her eyes.
“Gentlemen…” she began, her tone filled with feigned grief. “Perhaps you haven’t heard yet… I just got the news myself. My cousin-in-law, Sadie… She… She had a car accident on her way back to Jazmah. Her car caught on fire. I’m afraid she didn’t make it.”
Her words fell in the room like a clap of thunder.
I@te$t ￠#@pter$ In g@!novel$.c0m
Silence fell as the elders stared at her with similar expressions of shock and disbelief.
Jonah’s jaw dropped. What did Briley say? Sadie had a car accident? But how could that be? The other elders slowly returned to their wits and exchanged looks, but no one could muster a word.
Sadie had been an incredibly capable leader. How was she dead? This was all so sudden!
When the elders finally processed the news, the room erupted into chaos all at once.
“What do we do now?”
“With Sadie gone, what will happen to the Wall Group now?”
“The company’s fate depended entirely on her!”
“Everything we’ve worked for… Is it all going to fall apart now?”
The elders collectively spiraled into a panic, their lined faces tight with worry and fear.
Briley watched the chaos in smug satisfaction. It was almost time. Making sure that her mournful expression was still in place, she cleared her throat.
.
.
.
###Chapter 984:
“Gentlemen, please calm down,” she called out in a raised voice. “I know this may seem like the wrong time to say this, but we all know that a family like ours needs a leader to move forward. Likewise, the Wall Group cannot afford to be without a chairperson for even a single day.”
Briley paused and swept a glance over the room. “I know I’ve made mistakes in the past. I understand that some of you have a poor opinion of me. But I have reflected on my errors and learned from them.” She paused again, this time lowering her head in a show of remorse. “I know my errors are not to be taken lightly, but the Wall Group is currently facing a massive crisis, and with Sadie’s tragic passing… I feel a responsibility to this family! I shall step up and take the mantle. I will lead the Wall family!”
She lifted her head in a flourish. Her tone was firm, her gaze filled with determination.
As soon as she finished her speech, the room fell into yet another unnerving silence. No one spoke, and the glances the elders exchanged this time were filled with doubt.
Briley, the head of the family and the company? That would only spell disaster!
They were all too familiar with her and her family. They had taken a chance on her father before, and Coyle had almost ruined the company. He had lost so much money, and they were still dealing with the consequences of his foolish decisions!
How could Briley expect them to just hand over the Wall Group to her? She might as well tell them to forfeit the company and declare bankruptcy!noveldrama
No, they weren’t willing to take that risk.
Briley noted the skeptical looks thrown her way and inwardly cursed the stubborn geezers for failing to recognize her potential.
Still, she kept up her act.

“I know what you’re all worried about,” she said earnestly. “But Sadie…”
Briley paused again to choke on the sob.
Then she took a deep breath as if to steady herself before posing the question, “Is there anyone else in the Wall family who is more qualified than me?”
It hit the elders like a sudden, harsh slap of reality. Loathe as they were to admit it, Briley was absolutely right.
Noah, Sadie, and Sutton were all dead.
Apart from Briley, no one else was fit to take over the seat of power. The meeting hall gradually fell into silence again, until the only sound that could be heard was the heavy breathing of everyone.
The elders kept darting uneasy glances at each other, unsure of what to do next.
Did they really have to hand over the Wall Group to Briley? Although no one else was more suitable than her, she was far from the ideal candidate.
The elders continued to mull over the matter as the air in the room grew thick and heavy with tension.
.
.
.
###Chapter 985:
Then, out of nowhere, a calm yet commanding voice sounded from the doorway.
“What a joke! Do you really think there is no one left in our family?”
Everyone turned to find Isabel glide into the hall. She was holding the hand of a little boy who looked every bit as precious and delicate as a porcelain doll.
It was Averi.
Isabel’s face was blank for the most part, but her gaze was sharp and piercing as it fell on Briley.
Briley felt her heart drop to her stomach, and a sense of foreboding washed over her.
What was this old hag doing here? And why had she brought Sadie’s son with her?
Isabel averted her eyes to look at the elders one by one. When she spoke again, her voice was firm and resolute.
“Averi is the only child of Sadie and Noah. He may be young, but he is exceptionally intelligent for his age. More to the point, he is the only rightful heir to the Wall Group.”
She paused to let her words sink in before adding, “Even if Sadie really did perish in an unfortunate accident, the position of chairman shall pass on to her son.”
“When did this woman have the right to decide the fate of the family and the company?”
Jonah jumped to his feet, his palm connecting with his forehead. How had he not thought of this before? They always had another option!
He peered eagerly at Averi, who wasn’t even seven years old. But Noah himself had started managing the company at an early age, after spending most of his childhood shadowing his father.
Of course, a son should take over his father’s legacy. It was the natural way of things.
gα?ησν?s． brings magic to life
It certainly made far more sense than letting Briley take the reins, when she had caused the family nothing but trouble from the start!noveldrama
Briley’s face turned ashen, and she trembled where she stood. Her hands were clenched into fists so tight that her nails dug into her palms. This old bitch! How dare she want that small, useless rascal to challenge her claim! Well, she would never allow it!
Gritting her teeth, Briley plastered a fake smile on her face.
“You have a point,” she said. “But Averi is still very young. He may not be able to shoulder such a heavy responsibility.”
Then her tone turned cold and rather malicious as she addressed Isabel directly. “Isabel, you’re basically forcing so much burden on a mere child. Are you planning to use him as a puppet to take control of the company yourself?”
Isabel threw her head back and laughed. She didn’t even spare Briley a glance.
“And just who do you think you are to speak to me like that?” At the end of the day, Briley was just Coyle’s useless, despicable daughter, someone who didn’t have the skill or the spine to shine on her own merits.
.
.
.
###Chapter 986:
Isabel cocked her head to the side, pretending to contemplate something. Then her face lit up as if she had suddenly realized something.noveldrama
“Oh, now I remember. You’re the girl who was recently sued by the Howe family, publicly turned down a marriage proposal, and got caught on camera fooling around with multiple men. You’re Briley, right? Coyle’s daughter?”
Briley flinched as though she had been struck across the face. She could feel her face grow hot with anger and indignation.
The old witch was crossing the line! How could Isabel air her dirty laundry in front of the elders?
Briley gnashed her teeth together, barely keeping herself from lashing out at Isabel right there and then.
To everyone’s amazement, Averi slipped from Isabel’s grasp and stood in front of her, his arms stretched out wide as he glared up at Briley in defiance.
“Bad woman! You can’t bully Grandma!”
Despite his age and appearance, there was an unmistakable air of authority about him. He turned to the elders with a serious look on his chubby face.
“Although I’m still young, Mommy has already taken me to the finance department. I know how the company works! I will study hard and manage the Wall Group well! I won’t let bad people steal Mommy and Daddy’s company!”
The elders marveled at the little boy—so innocent and pure-hearted, yet so determined and righteous as well. Their hearts grew lighter in an instant, and a collective sense of relief swept over them.
Briley could see them warming up to Averi, and her rage surged to the surface.

That damn little devil!
How dare he call her names? She was his aunt!
Briley struggled to muster a smile instead of a sneer as she turned to Isabel. “I understand that kids sometimes speak without thinking. Isabel, it’s probably best that you take Averi back and teach him proper manners before bringing him to a family gathering again. Otherwise, he might end up bringing shame to the Wall family name when he grows up.”
Isabel finally looked at her then, but only to flash her a sarcastic smile. “How we raise our children in the Wall family does not concern outsiders.”
There it was. The word cut deep, like a thorn lodged in Briley’s heart.
Isabel had called her an outsider right to her face.
Before she could react to that, Jonah cleared his throat. “Enough!” he boomed, his voice echoing around the room. “This is no place for petty squabbles!”
No sooner had he said that last word than another female voice joined them from the entrance.
This one was playful, though, and while it wasn’t particularly loud, it rang clear enough for everyone to hear. “It appears that I have died—or so I have heard? I can’t help but wonder, Briley, how exactly did you come across this information?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 987:
Another stunned silence filled the room. Everyone was frozen in place, their eyes fixed on the door.
Isabel and Averi were the first to react, their initial surprise turning into joy and relief. “Mom!”
Averi wasted no time. He raced to the door, his arms already reaching for his mother.noveldrama
Sadie stood in the doorway, her figure silhouetted by the light from outside. She bent and opened her arms wide to catch Averi just as he threw himself into her embrace.
Sadie picked him up and held him close. Then she slowly made her way into the center of the room, her demeanor calm and graceful as ever.
A faint smile tugged at the corners of her lips, but her eyes were steady and serene.
She didn’t look at all like someone who had just survived a deadly accident.
Briley was rooted to the spot, her eyes wide with disbelief. She could practically feel the color drain from her face. Was she seeing a ghost?
No… But how could this be? How was Sadie still alive?
Hadn’t Ophelia said that Sadie had died in the car accident? Liar! That woman had lied to her!
Sadie was unbothered by the stares she was getting, but she did pause in front of Briley.
She took a brief moment to take in Briley’s reaction, then smiled and said in a gentle tone, “My flight got delayed. How did the rumors turn into me suddenly dying in a car accident?”
Sadie tilted her head to the side, her eyes still fixed on Briley. Although her smile deepened, her tone became icy. “You’re not wishing for my demise, are you, Briley?”
 ? ? ?ν﹒
Briley’s face went through a range of expressions, from shock to anger, then embarrassment, and eventually, dread. She opened her mouth, and her throat worked, but no words came out.
No, this was impossible! Sadie was truly alive and well!
Her little speech from earlier seemed so absurd in hindsight. She had gone ahead and humiliated herself in front of the family elders!
Jonah was the first among the old men to compose himself. His previously clouded eyes lit up with relief.
This was wonderful, indeed! Sadie was still alive! That meant continued stability for the Wall Group, and he and his fellow elders could continue reaping the benefits without worry.
Sadie was the only one capable enough to lead the company.
Jonah then turned his attention to Briley, who was still struggling to process the unexpected turn of events.
His eyes narrowed, and his upper lip curled in disdain. What a useless troublemaker! To think that she had dragged everyone out here in the middle of the night for some pathetic show of power, only for it all to be a sham.
.
.
.
###Chapter 988:noveldrama
The brat was utterly incorrigible! The elders needed all the rest they could get, yet Briley had disrupted their slumber for no real reason!
The more Jonah thought about it, the more furious he became. He slammed his cane against the floor.
“Briley!” he roared. “You have inconvenienced everyone, rousing us at such an ungodly hour and causing unnecessary panic and sorrow! To repent for your thoughtless actions, you shall kneel here and reflect for the rest of the night!”
Briley felt an acrid taste on her tongue. She was supposed to kneel in the hall for everyone to see? It was a fate worse than death!
But Jonah’s word was as good as law, and the other elders were already looking at her expectantly. She had no way out of this.
Despite the resentment that bubbled in her chest, she forced a smile and spoke through gritted teeth.
“I understand. I am very sorry. I was wrong.”
Swallowing her pride, she slowly sank to her knees. The cold, hard floor had her legs aching immediately, but the pain was nothing compared to the suffering of her ego.
Jonah watched her kneel and nodded in satisfaction. He went on to yawn loudly, clearly exhausted from the night’s kerfuffle.
“All right. I’m sure we are all relieved to have Sadie back, safe and sound. It’s late. We should all head home and catch some rest.” He waved his hand in a gesture of dismissal.
The rest of the elders murmured in agreement, and one by one, they rose from their chairs, helping each other as they hobbled out of the hall.
As they passed by Briley, many, if not all, took a few seconds to sneer or smirk at her.
  ?  ?ν[?]
Sadie glanced at Briley as well, though her eyes were now devoid of any emotion.
Still holding Averi, she ushered Isabel out of the hall and into the main living room.
As soon as they were alone, Isabel whipped around and grabbed Sadie by the arms. She inspected her daughter-in-law from head to toe, her face filled with concern.
“Sadie, are you really okay? You’re not hurt anywhere? I was so scared when I got the news!”
Only after confirming Sadie was unharmed did Isabel finally exhale in relief, the crushing weight of worry lifting from her chest.
Some of the elders were Isabel’s trusted allies.
The moment news reached her about Briley assembling the elders, alarm bells rang in Isabel’s mind.
Briley never made moves without calculating personal advantage—a gathering this significant could only spell trouble.
Isabel’s heart had lurched painfully at the thought that Sadie might be in peril, prompting her to race over with Averi in tow.
.
.
.
###Chapter 989:
To her immense relief, they had arrived just in time to prevent a catastrophe.
Isabel clutched Sadie’s hand, her voice quivering with residual fear. “Sadie, what exactly happened? How did that terrible rumor take root?”
Sadie patted Isabel’s hand with gentle reassurance, silently urging her to regain composure.
With the ghost of a smile playing on her lips, Sadie replied casually, “Nothing to worry about—just a calculated trap to catch them all in one swoop.”noveldrama
She outlined her strategy of disseminating misinformation to draw out her enemies, her stealthy escape, and subsequent return to Jazmah aboard a private jet. Naturally, she omitted the complicated entanglements with the Higgins and Johnson families.
Relief washed over Isabel as she absorbed Sadie’s explanation. “Nothing matters more than your safety,” she whispered, nodding vigorously while tears threatened to spill from her glistening eyes. The night’s harrowing events had shaken Isabel to her core. Mercifully, Sadie’s quick thinking and sharp vigilance had prevented disaster.
Sadie knelt to face her son. Averi, visibly rattled by the meeting hall’s chaos, gripped her neck with tiny, desperate fingers.
She brushed tender fingers through his fine hair, her voice melting into a soothing murmur. “Averi, sweetie, it’s past your bedtime. How about you rest with Grandma? Mommy needs to handle a few things, but I promise I’ll return quickly.”
Despite his obvious reluctance, Averi nodded bravely. “Promise you’ll hurry, Mommy?” His small voice wavered as he reached for her, tiny arms encircling her in a desperate hug.
Only after ensuring Isabel and Averi were safely settled did Sadie finally pivot toward the exit, stepping out of Wall Manor.
Night had blanketed the world in inky darkness. A sleek black sedan waited silently along the curb.
g?ν.0, ?  ?
Samuel had been stationed in the vehicle for hours. The moment he glimpsed her silhouette approaching, he sprang from the driver’s seat and swung open the rear door with practiced precision.
Sadie ducked into the car’s plush interior, massaging her throbbing temples with slender fingers.
“What’s the situation in Beversea?”
Samuel slid back behind the wheel, twisting his torso to address her with respectful efficiency.
“The highway ‘accident’ has been sanitized precisely as you instructed. We intercepted two separate teams. One was dispatched by Briley, while the other—according to our surviving captives—was orchestrated by Ophelia.”
A razor-thin smile, cold as midwinter frost, lifted one corner of Sadie’s mouth.
Briley and Ophelia—kindred spirits united by their singular desire to see her in a coffin.
.

.
###Chapter 990:
Sadie’s eyes hardened to obsidian.
“Eliminate them,” she commanded, her voice devoid of inflection. “Every last one. Leave no witnesses, no traces.”
“Consider it done,” Samuel murmured, hesitating visibly as though words perched unspoken on his tongue.
Sadie caught his hesitation, one eyebrow arching questioningly. Before she could probe further, her phone erupted with a shrill ring.
The name pulsing across her screen deepened her frown. Nathan. What urgent business could he have at this ungodly hour?
Sadie swiped to answer. Immediately, Nathan’s voice exploded through the speaker, saturated with relief and frenetic energy—the panicked reaction of someone who’d believed her dead only moments ago.
“Sadie! Thank God! You’re alive! Have you any concept of my worry? I was convinced you’d perished in those highway flames!”
Sadie flinched away from the volume assault, jerking the phone to a safer distance from her sensitive ear.
Her brows knitted tighter as irritation flared.
“Lower your voice,” she snapped. “You’re assaulting my eardrums.”
From the driver’s position, Samuel discreetly bowed his head, eavesdropping on their exchange. Nathan’s dramatic response came as no surprise.
What Samuel had been hesitating to speak about was exactly Nathan’s heroics on the highway. He had recklessly attempted to rescue Sadie from the blazing vehicle, nearly succumbing to smoke inhalation during his effort.
Now Nathan’s call had preempted his planned revelation, catching him off-guard.

“Calm down,” Sadie commanded, her voice steady and measured. “What’s the situation in Beversea now?”
On the other end of the line, Nathan inhaled deeply several times, struggling to rein in his frayed nerves.
The image of the blackened, twisted car wreckage on the highway haunted him still, a cold fear clutching at his chest like an unwelcome visitor.
Thankfully, Sadie had emerged unscathed. Had she been injured—or worse—he knew he would be in deep trouble.
“It’s just as you expected,” Nathan said, his voice still laced with tension, though he’d lowered it to a more controlled level.
“The police have started the investigation. The Johnsons are spiraling into panic—their downfall imminent. Meanwhile, my family has strategically distanced ourselves to shield our interests from the fallout.”
He paused, savoring the moment as satisfaction dripped from every syllable. “Honestly, Ophelia’s incompetence borders on the spectacular. She scattered evidence like breadcrumbs, practically pleading to be apprehended!”

###Chapter 991:
To fortify their position, the Higgins family had “accidentally” funneled every damning piece of evidence pointing to Ophelia straight into police hands. The Johnson family now faced an avalanche of consequences from which they could never hope to escape unscathed. Contemplating the current situation, Nathan felt a delicious lightness bubble up inside him, replacing the earlier dread.
“Oh, and thanks to Ophelia’s spectacular downfall, my dear brother’s carefully crafted reputation at the company lies in smoking ruins. After all, Ophelia is still his wife. The senior executives have convened an emergency meeting to burn the midnight oil plotting damage control, while Jarrett’s position hangs by a thread.”
He could almost visualize Jarrett’s humiliating descent from power, the mental image flooding him with a perverse satisfaction that warmed him from within like aged whiskey.noveldrama
Sadie absorbed his words in calculated silence, a ghost of a smile dancing at the corners of her lips. The elaborate chess game unfolded precisely according to her meticulous design.
The Johnson family now crumbled like a house of cards, Jarrett’s power slipping through his fingers like water, and Nathan—the overlooked heir to the Higgins family—
Empire—finally had the chance to ascend to the position of power he had coveted for so long.
“Then allow me to offer my congratulations prematurely, Nathan,” she purred, amusement threading through her silken voice. “It appears the crown of the Higgins Group will soon rest upon your ambitious head.”
Nathan arched an eyebrow at her prophetic words, a self-satisfied smirk spreading across his face like spilled ink. His spirits soared high.
“Then I’ll say thank you!” he replied cheerfully. The intoxicating vision of wielding absolute control over the Higgins Group filled his mind—soon no one would ever dare cast a disparaging glance in his direction again.
New chapters now on .c?m
Their conversation dwindled to its natural conclusion shortly thereafter, neither having more to discuss now that the pieces were in play.
Sadie flicked her phone onto the leather seat beside her with practiced nonchalance, dismissing it as easily as she dismissed those who opposed her.
From her designer handbag, she extracted a crisp slip of paper Nathan had given her before, a cryptic string of numbers scrawled across its pristine surface.
She leaned forward and extended the paper toward Samuel, who sat ramrod straight behind the steering wheel.
“Look into the owner of this number,” she instructed, her eyes darkening to the color of storm clouds gathering on the horizon. “Once you’ve located her, arrange her discreet transportation to Jazmah—ensure absolutely no one takes notice.”
Samuel accepted the paper with both hands in a gesture of deference, scrutinized the sequence of digits momentarily, and inclined his head.
“Consider it done, Ms. Hudson.”

###Chapter 992:
The luxurious vehicle descended into profound silence, punctuated only by the gentle purr of the engine as it glided through the velvet darkness of the night.
Thirty minutes later, the sleek machine navigated through the imposing gates of Myrtlewood Estate and eased to a graceful halt.
Samuel disembarked with practiced efficiency, circling around to swing open the rear door with a flourish.
“Ms. Hudson, may the remainder of your evening bring you peace,” he offered with quiet respect.
Sadie acknowledged his sentiment with the barest inclination of her head and emerged from the vehicle with effortless elegance, her stilettos clicking softly against the cobblestone driveway.
Samuel maintained his vigilant stance, observing her progress until she disappeared safely within the villa’s confines, before returning to the driver’s seat and steering the vehicle back into the enveloping darkness.
Poised at her threshold, Sadie extended her manicured finger toward the biometric scanner when a peculiar anomaly caught her attention—a solitary light glowed from within one of the second-floor rooms of the long-abandoned Autumn Garden Villa that loomed across the street.
The once-magnificent Autumn Garden Villa had stood hauntingly empty for years following the previous owner’s abrupt departure, its windows dark and soulless—until now. Who had claimed this forsaken property as their new domain?
A delicate furrow marred Sadie’s perfect brow momentarily before she dismissed the curiosity with practiced indifference. The mysterious new occupant constituted someone else’s concern, not hers.
She pivoted back toward her door, pressed her finger against the scanner, which responded with a soft electronic chime, and glided into the expansive living room bathed in ambient lighting.
R3ad the r3zt at glnoνels.
Unbeknownst to her keen senses, as she vanished beyond her threshold, a tall, commanding figure loomed silently by the panoramic window of the study on the second floor of the Autumn Garden Villa, his powerful silhouette barely discernible against the backdrop of darkness.
Noah had tracked the achingly familiar silhouette until it dissolved behind the heavy door, his penetrating gaze swimming with a tempest of emotions too intricate to unravel.
With deliberate slowness that heightened the tension saturating the room, he rotated toward Jack, who remained frozen several paces away, scarcely permitting himself to draw breath in the oppressive atmosphere.
Noah’s voice sliced through the silence, low and laden with arctic frost as he asked, “The car accident—are we certain only Ophelia and Briley were responsible?”noveldrama
Ophelia was an idiot, while Briley could only come up with half-baked schemes. The notion that these two intellectual lightweights could collaborate to orchestrate such a meticulously planned ‘accident’ was unthinkable.
.
.
.
###Chapter 993:
An involuntary shudder rippled through Jack’s frame at Noah’s piercing inquiry, prompting him to hastily drop his gaze to the imported marble floor, his survival instincts screaming against meeting those lethal eyes directly.
Jack’s mind flashed back to the terrifying transformation that had overtaken Noah’s features earlier that day when the news first reached him that Sadie might have perished in a fiery vehicular inferno, her body reduced to unrecognizable ash.
Jack harbored not the slightest doubt that, had Sadie suffered even the most minor injury, both the Johnson family and Briley would have been systematically erased from existence with such devastating thoroughness that even their memories would vanish from public consciousness.
Jack hastily retrieved the comprehensive investigation report he had meticulously compiled, extending it toward his employer with both hands in a gesture that acknowledged the power disparity between them.
“Boss, our investigation confirms that a third party orchestrated events from the shadows. However, this person operated with exceptional caution, leaving behind only a handful of indirect call records. Concrete evidence continues to elude our grasp for the moment.”
Noah accepted the folder, his penetrating gaze darkening to the color of a midnight ocean during a tempest. “Who is it?” he asked.
Jack’s throat constricted, words momentarily trapped behind the knot of apprehension that threatened to choke him. He understood with crystal clarity precisely how volcanic his boss’s reaction would be to the name he must now divulge.
Noah lowered his piercing gaze to the folder, his aristocratic fingers methodically navigating through the pages with deceptive casualness that belied the deadly focus of his attention.
The moment his gaze alighted upon the familiar sequence of digits inscribed on the page, his expression crystallized into something beyond mere coldness—a glacial mask of controlled fury that made the room temperature seem to plummet several degrees. His eyes narrowed to dangerous slits.
It was Hailey—the very name conjured venom in his veins. The investigation revealed multiple lengthy telephone exchanges between her and Briley during the twenty-four hours preceding the orchestrated “accident,” creating a damning pattern impossible to dismiss as coincidental.
Jack, witnessing the transformation rippling across Noah’s countenance, paradoxically discovered some courage and said, “Boss, perhaps… perhaps we should consider the possibility of mere coincidence… or some fundamental misunderstanding of the evidence…”
Jack had barely finished speaking when Noah suddenly turned his cold, sharp gaze on him.
Jack immediately fell silent, a part of him regretting he had said anything. What had gotten into him, anyway?noveldrama
Noah closed the file, his face blank. Without saying a word, he turned and walked out of the study.
.
.
.
###Chapter 994:
Jack trailed after him without a second to waste.
An hour later, a black car cruised into the suburbs of Jazmah and pulled to a stop in front of a brightly lit villa.
Noah stepped out of the car first, with Jack following closely behind. They entered the villa, their strides brisk and long.
They stopped at the foyer when they heard frantic muttering coming from the living room.
Hailey was pacing back and forth in her silk robe, her hands clenching and unclenching as she continued with her hushed tirade.
“That idiot! Completely useless! After all the hints I gave, the schemes I planned… what did she achieve?! That bitch doesn’t even know how to cover her tracks properly! As if it wasn’t bad enough that she failed to kill Sadie, she’s just had to get herself caught! If the authorities trace this back to me…” Hailey trailed off, too scared to explore that line of thought.
A muscle ticked in Noah’s jaw as he glared at Hailey’s back. He had heard enough.
“Who were you planning to kill?” he asked, his voice low and menacing.
Hailey froze for a few seconds, then whipped around in alarm.
A look of horror crossed her face when she saw that it was Noah. Why was he back all of a sudden? Shouldn’t he be at the company? Or perhaps at Autumn Garden Villa? Had he discovered the truth? Hailey’s chest tightened, and she struggled to suppress her panic. She quickly plastered a strained smile on her face and hurried over to Noah. She was so caught up in her paranoia that she didn’t notice the dangerous aura that thrummed around him.noveldrama
“Noah! What brings you here all of a sudden?” Hailey asked, doing her best to sound normal with just a touch of surprise. “You should have called and told me you were coming. I could have had the servants prepare your favorite dishes.”
Fresh chapters are live at gα?ησvs?com
As she said this, she slowly inched toward the kitchen and away from him. She couldn’t let him see her guilt. She had to pretend like she knew nothing, or he might suspect her of being involved in Sadie’s recent misfortunes.
Needless to say, Noah saw right through her little innocent act. His lips curled into a chilling smile.
Still saying nothing, he slammed a thick kraft paper file onto the polished marble floor. It fell with a sharp crack, followed by the sound of fluttering papers as they were sent flying in all directions.
Hailey flinched at the noise, her instincts screaming at her to flee. But she didn’t. She couldn’t.
Slowly, she turned around, her gaze falling on the sheets of paper scattered on the floor.
They were call logs. Even from where she stood, she recognized the numbers listed on the report. One was her private number, and the other belonged to Briley.
She jerked her head up to meet Noah’s eyes. They burned with a kind of rage and hatred that seared her very soul.
.
.
.
###Chapter 995:
Hailey opened her mouth, but her throat seemed to close in, and no sound came out.
It was over. Noah knew everything now.
How did he even find out this soon?
Noah took a step closer, then another. His presence seemed to suck all the warmth from the room, until all that was left was a heavy sense of dread and despair.
Without any warning, his hand shot out and closed around Hailey’s delicate neck. His fingers tightened like a noose, and she immediately found it hard to breathe.
The only reason Noah had refrained from confronting her until now was that he had naively thought Hailey still had some semblance of a conscience within her. But after what he had witnessed just now, he realized he had given her too much credit.
“If you lay a finger on Sadie again, you can forget about getting any mercy from me.”
Hailey’s vision was blurry at that point, and her face had turned an alarming shade of red. She clawed at Noah’s hand and tried to pry herself free, but her efforts were all in vain.
The file showed that she had just made a few calls to Briley. That was it—just a few calls!
“What…” Hailey gasped. “What did I do? Why would I… hurt Sadie? I don’t have anything… against her…”
She tried to defend herself in between gasps for air. Her only hope now was to distance herself from the incident so she could insist on her innocence.
But contrary to her goals, her denial only fanned the flames of Noah’s anger.
Nothing against Sadie, she said? What a piss-poor lie!

He tightened his grip even more. Hailey’s eyes began to roll back, her arms going slack.
Jack, who had been watching it all unfold from the sidelines, snapped to attention.noveldrama
If this continued, Noah might actually kill Hailey!
Jack couldn’t let that happen. After all, Hailey was still the Burgess family heiress, and she still held considerable power within the Burgess Group.
Most important of all, she was still technically Noah’s wife!
If she died by Noah’s hands, it would cause a scandal of epic proportions. Not only would the Burgess family retaliate against Noah, but the Wall family would likely be dragged into the chaos as well.
“Boss!” Jack cried out as he rushed forward. “Boss, you need to calm down! She’s not worth it!”
The urgency in his voice snapped Noah back to his senses, and his rage abated slightly.
He stared at the woman he had seized, drool running down her mouth as she gasped for air, and his handsome face twisted into a disgusted sneer.
.
.
.
###Chapter 996:
Noah let go of Hailey just as suddenly as he had choked her, shoving her to the side like some piece of trash.
She crumpled to the floor, clutching her throat as violent coughs racked her body.
Noah’s fingers had left their mark on her skin—a stark reminder of her narrow brush with death.
Jack heaved a huge sigh of relief. He turned to the servants, who had frozen in fear as soon as Noah arrived.
“Why are you just standing there?” he shouted at them. “Move!”
“Get a doctor, now!” Jack’s voice thundered through the room, his face flushed with urgency.
The stunned servants jolted to attention, their momentary paralysis shattered. They scattered immediately, footsteps echoing down the hallway as they raced to summon the family physician.
Hailey’s body convulsed with violent coughs, her lungs fighting for air until she finally gulped down a ragged breath.
She crumpled onto the icy marble, her once-perfect appearance now in ruins—tangled hair splayed across her shoulders, silk robe twisted awkwardly around her trembling frame.
Mustering what dignity remained, she raised her chin to meet Noah’s towering presence. His eyes bored into hers, glacial and unforgiving, stripped of even a flicker of compassion.
The terror gripping her heart dissolved, crystallizing instead into a potent mixture of humiliation and bitter resentment.
By what authority did he dare treat her this way? Was precious Sadie worth all this?
A smile twisted across Hailey’s lips—not one of joy, but a venomous curl that spoke of dangerous thoughts brewing beneath.
“Noah, remember this,” she rasped, each word scraping through her throat yet fortified with the steel resolve of someone with nothing left to surrender.
“I saved your life! Three years ago at Rosewood Hospital, you would’ve been nothing but a corpse without me! You owe me—your very existence! That debt follows you to your grave!”
She recognized this as her last remaining card to play. With calculated defiance, she thrust her chin upward, her gaze blazing with unwavering certainty.
“You accuse me of harming Sadie? Where’s your proof? What do these call logs actually demonstrate? Briley and I share a friendship—since when is communication a crime? Will you condemn me based on flimsy papers? Hear me clearly: I refuse to take this blame!”
A sense of security washed over her. Noah lacked any tangible evidence—a strategic advantage she’d ensured by keeping her own hands pristinely clean.
She had merely whispered poisonous suggestions into Briley’s ear—a woman already drowning in jealousy—through their seemingly innocent phone conversations.

###Chapter 997:
She wouldn’t risk blood on her manicured fingertips when manipulation proved far more elegant. Deploying another’s hands for her schemes was brilliance itself. Her sole error lay in selecting such an incompetent instrument for her plans.
“For your sake, it better be,” Noah’s voice cut through the air like a frozen blade, stripped of even a whisper of human sentiment.
He turned around, each footstep purposeful as he marched toward the exit.
Hailey’s pathetic attempt at self-justification turned his stomach with disgust.
Noah halted at the threshold, his silhouette framed starkly against the doorway.
He swiveled his head, pinning the servants with a gaze so frigid they dared not even draw breath, their bodies frozen in place.
“Ms. Burgess is unwell. She requires complete home rest. Under no circumstances is she permitted to leave these premises. Am I perfectly clear?”
His words sliced through the air—each syllable a precisely aimed dagger that pierced straight to the core.
Without another word, Noah strode from the villa, his departure absolute, his back a wall of finality.
Jack scrambled after him, not brave enough to linger even a moment longer in that suffocating atmosphere.
“Sir!” Jack panted as he matched Noah’s stride, anxiety threading through his voice like a fraying wire.
“That confrontation was dangerously impulsive! If Hailey suffers any harm, the Burgess Group will unleash their full arsenal against you! Ms. Hudson and the Wall Group could become collateral damage in their vendetta!”
The terror still clung to Jack’s spine, an icy remnant of what he’d witnessed.
Gal no ve l s . com hosts your favorite stories
That deadly glint in Noah’s eyes had been chillingly real. Had his fingers tightened just a fraction more around Hailey’s throat, they’d be facing catastrophic fallout beyond calculation.
Noah faltered mid-step. The red haze of rage had blinded his typically sharp reasoning, leaving his actions uncalculated and dangerous. Hailey deserved death, yet her demise couldn’t come now—and certainly not with his fingerprints as evidence.
He pivoted toward Jack, the murderous storm in his gaze now receding to merely threatening clouds.noveldrama
“Monitor her every move,” he instructed, his tone resuming its characteristic control, though now laced with an undercurrent of frost. “Though Hailey doesn’t seem directly involved in Sadie’s car accident, her fingerprints are somewhere on this scheme. Report every breath she takes, every call she makes, directly to me—no delays.”
The notion of Hailey’s innocence struck him as laughable. Her mind calculated moves like a chess master, her heart as merciless as a winter storm.
.
.
.
###Chapter 998:
“Consider it done,” Jack affirmed with a deferential nod, relief washing through him as Noah’s volcanic temper cooled to manageable levels.
A hint of reassurance eased Noah’s shoulders as he approached his waiting vehicle, yanked open the door, and slid into the leather interior.
At that precise moment, a gleaming black sedan crept up the driveway, purring to a halt before the villa’s grand entrance.
The sedan’s door swung wide, revealing Forest as he emerged with practiced grace. His eyes instantly locked onto Noah, and his features transformed with a beaming, calculated smile.
Forest’s mind raced. Patrick visiting Hailey? Perhaps his worthless daughter had finally maneuvered her way back into Patrick’s good graces after all.
Anticipation surged through Forest as he hastened forward, eager to intercept Noah before his departure.
“Patr…” The word died on his lips as the Maybach’s engine snarled to life, tires spitting gravel as it accelerated past him without acknowledgment.
A cloud of dust engulfed him, particles stinging his eyes and coating his expensive suit, his smile vanishing as quickly as the departing vehicle.
Confusion clouded his thoughts. Something was terribly amiss. Patrick’s behavior didn’t align with that of a man reconciled with Hailey!
Bewilderment etched deep lines across Forest’s forehead as his gaze darted toward the villa’s entrance. A familiar chill of foreboding crawled up his vertebrae. Without wasting another moment, he rushed inside, bracing for whatever scene awaited.
Forest entered the living room and was greeted by the sight of his daughter slumped on the floor, looking utterly devastated.
? ?  .
Her disheveled appearance told him all he needed to know—things had ended badly.
Forest’s brows knitted into a frown.
What a worthless fool Hailey had proven to be! Patrick had even shown up in person, but she still failed to make him stay.
Forest’s lips curled into a sneer. He let out a derisive snort before walking upstairs without another backward glance.
Hailey balled her hands into fists, her heart burning with resentment. Why was this happening to her? She had been by Noah’s side for three whole years! What had Sadie done for him in all that time? Nothing, and yet, he still ran back to that shameless bitch in the end. Noah had almost killed her—all for Sadie’s sake.noveldrama
Hailey gritted her teeth. She wasn’t about to sit back and do nothing.
But it was far too risky to go after Sadie head-on. Noah had made it painfully clear that he would do anything to protect that woman. If Hailey pushed her luck, she might just end up destroying herself.
No, there had to be another way.
Hailey racked her brains for another option. Then it hit her—perhaps it would be best if Sadie somehow backed off on her own.
.
.
.
###Chapter 999:
Hailey’s eyes glinted with renewed determination as she gingerly pulled herself off the floor.
She walked over to the full-length mirror and wiped the tears from her face. She needed to be calm and levelheaded. She couldn’t afford to lose.
The shrill ringing of her phone interrupted her musings.
It was Briley. That imbecile.
With an impatient huff, Hailey grabbed her phone and snapped, “What is it now?”noveldrama
Briley spoke in between panicked sobs.
“Hailey! Hailey, you have to help me. Please help me! The people I sent after Sadie—they got caught! They’re in police custody as we speak. They… They will definitely spill everything! I can’t go to jail, Hailey! I don’t want to go to jail! You have to do something!”
Hailey found her sniveling annoying.
Again and again, Briley kept proving just how useless she was. It was too late for her to fear the consequences; she should have thought about them before she made a move. Maybe then, she might have succeeded in such a simple task.
Hailey’s lips curled into a mocking smile.
“Oh? So your men got caught… What does that have to do with me, though?”
Her words hit Briley like a ton of bricks. Her crying stopped abruptly, her eyes widening in disbelief.
Was Hailey actually cutting ties with her now? And then what, she was just going to pretend she wasn’t involved at all?
“Hailey!” Briley exploded in indignation. “Don’t forget that it was you who—”
g?lnσν?s?com takes you to new worlds
“I did what?” Hailey interrupted, her voice sharp as a cracking whip. Her tone carried a subtle threat when she continued, “You’d better watch what you say, Briley. I haven’t done anything. From the very start, weren’t you the one who hated Sadie the most? You were jealous of her, and you desperately wanted her done. Now that your plans have backfired, did you think you can simply pin the blame on me? Dream on!”
Hailey had foreseen this outcome from a mile away, which was why she had been very careful. She made sure to only use burner phones and kept the conversations vague on her part. She never left any evidence that might incriminate her.
On the other end of the line, Briley was shaking with fury.
It turned out that Hailey was a vile, conniving snake!
Hailey had been the one whispering in her ear about a future where Sadie no longer stood in her way. Hailey had kept telling her that for as long as Sadie was around, there would be no place for her in the Wall family.
Hailey had been the one to plant the seed, the one to poison the well—and now she was washing her hands clean of the whole scheme?
Briley couldn’t hold herself back from cursing. “You bitch! If I go down, I’ll make sure that you’re going down with me! I will tell the police everything myself! Let’s see how long you last!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1000:
But Hailey was not fazed in the least. She let out a condescending laugh.
Was there no end to Briley’s stupidity? She didn’t seem to understand just who she was dealing with.noveldrama
“Is that right?” Hailey taunted. “Listen to me, Briley, and use that pea-sized brain of yours for once. If the both of us go down, who do you think will benefit the most? The Wall Group, Noah—Sadie is going to have it all. Once we’re out of the picture, there will be no one left to stop her. Is that what you want?”
Briley fell into stunned silence. Of course, she didn’t want that! Why should Sadie get everything?
Her frenzied rage mellowed out as reality slowly sank in. Hailey was right. She couldn’t let Sadie win.
No sooner had Briley thought this than she heard a loud crash. The door to her apartment burst open, and a team of uniformed police officers stormed inside.
Briley could do no more than drop her phone in horror.
Briley’s face turned as white as a sheet, her slender frame trembling with fear.
The lead officer, his face impassive, approached her.
He pulled out his badge and a piece of paper from his pocket.
“Miss Wall, we are from the Jazmah Criminal Investigation Unit. We have an arrest warrant for you. You’re accused of hiring someone to stage a traffic accident with the intent to murder Sadie Hudson. We need you to come to the station with us and hope that you will assist us in the ongoing investigation.”
The next morning, at Myrtlewood Estate, Sadie had a light breakfast and prepared to go to the hospital for her prenatal check-up.
She drove out of the estate and was about to get onto the main road when she saw the iron gates of the Autumn Garden Villa open. A sleek black car rolled out, understated yet undeniably luxurious. The window to the back seat was partially lowered, revealing the sharp, cold profile of a man in a silver mask.
L€$? ￠t?€я? ?η ?@lи?νεl?.c?m
It was a brief and fleeting glimpse, but Sadie could never mistake that familiar figure.
Her hands tightened around the steering wheel.
It was Noah. She was certain of it.
What was he doing here? Had Noah moved into the Autumn Garden Villa?
She couldn’t help but feel uneasy at the thought.
Sadie pulled over to grab her phone and call Samuel.
“Can you look into something for me? I need the name of one of my neighbors, the one living in the Autumn Garden Villa.” Samuel was taken aback by her request.
Wasn’t the Autumn Garden Villa supposed to be vacant?
Although puzzled, he didn’t ask any questions. “Of course, Ms. Hudson. I’ll check and get back to you as soon as I get the information.”

Message from Noah: Great Sunday for you dear readers, sorry for being a bit late. God loves you and Noah whishes you all the best. ?(^?^ )? ′-

###Chapter 1001:
“Thanks.” Sadie hung up and tossed the phone onto the passenger seat. Taking a deep breath, she started the engine and merged into traffic. The drive felt endless. Her mind kept circling back to that brief, unexpected encounter, and that initial feeling of dread seemed to grow with every passing minute.
Half an hour later, she finally arrived at Jazmah Hopevale Hospital. Sadie headed straight to the obstetrics department, where her doctor was already waiting.
She underwent a series of tests, and after reviewing the results, the doctor gave her a reassuring smile.
“Everything looks great, Ms. Hudson. Your baby’s development is right on track. Just make sure you get plenty of rest and avoid overexerting yourself.”noveldrama
The doctor continued with a few more reminders, but Sadie only nodded absentmindedly, her thoughts elsewhere.
“Thank you, doctor.” She took the printed report and stepped out of the consultation room, still lost in her thoughts.
She had planned to visit Wall Manor to see her son, Averi, but as she exited the building, she ran into yet another familiar face.
The woman was dressed in a high-end suit, completed by a cream-colored cashmere coat—a glaring symbol of opulence.
Her carefully painted face was tight with impatience.
Hailey Burgess.
Sadie stopped in her tracks and frowned. What was Hailey doing here? Her eyes instinctively drifted to Hailey’s stomach. It was hard to see much due to the thick coat, but she thought she could detect a slight protrusion.
Was Hailey really carrying Noah’s child?
  ? ? ?: gν
Sadie felt a surge of conflicting emotions at the thought.
Hailey was about to lash out at the person who dared to bump into her, but she froze when she saw that it was none other than Sadie.
Her irritation was instantly replaced by a taunting smile. “Well, well, well, if it isn’t Ms. Hudson.” Hailey’s tone was far from friendly as she looked Sadie up and down, her gaze finally resting on the report in Sadie’s hand.
Hailey brought a hand to her mouth and feigned surprise. “Oh, my. Are you ill, Ms. Hudson?” As if the obvious malice in her voice wasn’t enough, her smile twisted into a mocking smirk.
“But then again, you’re young, beautiful, and skilled. I’m sure men are lining up at your doorstep. It’s only right that you pay regular visits to the obstetrics department. After all, with a love life as colorful as yours, you need to take every precaution, right?”
Sadie’s face hardened at the insinuation. Hailey was as insufferable as ever.
“Ms. Burgess,” Sadie bit out, her tone sharp with warning. “I would advise you to be careful with your words.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1002:
Hailey blinked innocently at her. Then she ran her hand down the not-so-obvious bump in her belly.
“I think you’re confused, Ms. Hudson. You didn’t address me correctly just now.” Hailey haughtily lifted her chin and continued, “I’m Patrick’s wife now—his only legitimate wife. And I am carrying his child. Shouldn’t you be calling me…”
She paused and tilted her head to the side, and when she spoke again, she emphasized every syllable of each word. “Mrs. Noel?”
A wave of nausea washed over Sadie. She couldn’t take any more of Hailey’s smug arrogance, nor was she interested in speaking to her any further.
She shot Hailey a cold, dismissive glance before turning to leave.
But Hailey acted quickly, stepping in front of Sadie to block her path. “What’s the rush, Ms. Hudson?” Then, almost as an afterthought, she added, “Oh, I almost forgot. Didn’t my husband specifically hire you to design a set of jewelry? He mentioned it was a gift… a custom-made set, just for me.”
Sadie remembered that with painful clarity. Her gaze lifted—glacial and slicing.
Hailey, apparently unaffected by the frost in her eyes, maintained her pleasant facade.
“How’s the jewelry design progressing, Ms. Hudson? I really fancy crossing paths like this. Why don’t we sit and have a proper chat?”
Sadie’s hand clamped tighter around the medical report, her fingertips blanching.
She was seconds from hurling her scalding drink straight into Hailey’s smug, self-satisfied grin.
Suppressing the fire climbing her throat, she responded evenly, “That won’t be necessary.”
Her tone was sharp and impassive. “There are pressing matters I must prioritize. As for the design—we’ll revisit that at a later date.” She pivoted to walk away, but Hailey moved to intercept, positioning herself directly in Sadie’s way.
g ? lnσ ν ?s?com, your storytelling home
The grin faltered, replaced by something steelier, more deliberate.
“You’re the head of Wall Group, aren’t you? And your entire brand is built on client-first values, right? So tell me, why am I being dismissed? Patrick said this couldn’t wait. Imagine the consequences if this got around…”noveldrama
She let the thought linger, her gaze fastening onto Sadie’s with surgical precision. “Could tarnish the company’s image, don’t you think?”
Sadie froze mid-stride, then turned back deliberately.
Hailey recognized the hit instantly. Her expression shimmered with smug satisfaction.
She’d always known how much Sadie cared about Wall Group. That pressure point always yielded results.
Hailey’s grin softened into something almost warm. “There’s a nice café nearby,” she said with a casual flick of the wrist. “Shall we, Ms. Hudson?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1003:
They walked into the nearby café.
A server approached their table, and Hailey spoke first, her demeanor poised and polished.
“Two lattes, please. One warm. Thank you.”
Then, turning toward Sadie, Hailey placed a hand gently over her own midsection.noveldrama
The move was subtle, yet unmistakably assertive—a reminder of her status.
With calculated sweetness, she added, “I hope it’s not an issue. My doctor warned me off anything chilled—baby’s orders.” Sadie found the display nauseating.
All she wanted now was to end this quickly and leave.
Her voice shifted, precise and brisk.
“Ms. Burgess, your custom order is nearing completion. I’ve sent preliminary drafts to Mr. Noel, though I haven’t received final input.” She paused, retrieving her tablet from her purse.
“Given this isn’t a scheduled appointment, I only brought the digital files.”
With that, she opened the folder and handed over the device. Hailey flipped through the sketches, clearly unimpressed. Her frown deepened with each swipe.
The pieces bore Noah’s signature aesthetic—stately and luxurious—but lacked the soft, romantic nuance she’d envisioned.
And above all, they weren’t what she wanted.
She looked up with an exaggerated pout.
“You’re supposed to be the prodigy of the decade, but this… feels off-brand, don’t you think? Tell me, Ms. Hudson—is this intentional? Some kind of personal slight?”
Ltτ ch?ɑρτ?rs ιn glov?l.?оm
Sadie’s fingers curled beneath the table, though her expression remained impassive. Her reply was smooth, distant.
“These drafts follow Mr. Noel’s directives to the letter. If the two of you have differing visions for the final design, I suggest the two of you align your expectations. I’ll adjust the design accordingly.”
Hailey caught the veiled dismissal. She set the tablet aside and softened her demeanor.
With a delicate sigh, she said, “Don’t get me wrong, Ms. Hudson. Noah and I are deeply invested in this celebration. Every detail matters—especially the jewelry. Naturally, we’re a little… meticulous. I hope you can appreciate that.”
Just then, the drinks arrived—one warm, one frosted.
Hailey took the one for herself, sipping with a dainty tilt of her wrist.
She gave a nod of approval. “Not bad.”
Then, she looked up, her smile reappearing like clockwork.
“The iced ones here are fantastic, by the way. You really ought to try it, Ms. Hudson.”
Sadie hesitated. Being in her first few weeks of pregnancy, she knew she absolutely couldn’t have anything iced. But a flat-out rejection would just be the perfect excuse for Hailey to call her rude.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1004:
Sure enough, Hailey’s smile widened when she noticed Sadie’s pause. “Is there a problem, Ms. Hudson?” she asked, her tone mocking. “Do you think you’re too good to accept a simple gesture? Or is there perhaps something else holding you back from taking a small sip?”noveldrama
The air between them grew thick with tension.
Just then, a playful voice interrupted them. “Well, well, if it isn’t Ms. Hudson and Ms. Burgess. What are the chances of me running into you here?”
Blaine sauntered up to them, sporting his signature roguish smile. He had noticed the strained atmosphere between the women from across the room.
He swept his gaze over the table until it settled on the iced coffee in front of Sadie. It only took Blaine a couple of seconds to piece things together.
Without a word, he picked up the glass from the table and downed its contents in one go. He even let out a satisfied little burp when he was done.
Hailey’s expression froze, her upper lip twitching slightly. Her carefully orchestrated plan to humiliate Sadie had just been thwarted by this infuriating rascal, who seemed incapable of minding his own business. Blaine was utterly insufferable!
Blaine himself was unfazed as he looked back and forth between Sadie and Hailey, scratching his nose. “What? Was that drink spoken for?”
Sadie couldn’t hold back a quiet laugh. A soft smile was still tugging at her lips as she raised her eyes to Hailey.
“I think I’ve been more than courteous, wouldn’t you agree, Ms. Burgess?”
Beneath the table, Hailey’s hands had balled into fists. This wretched woman!
Still, she swallowed her ire and forced a tight smile. “You really are lucky, Ms. Hudson. No matter where you go, there’s always a knight in shining armor willing to jump in and save your day.”
  ? .
Then, she changed the subject, her tone now heavy with meaning as she continued, “Speaking of which, I’ve heard quite a few stories floating around. Tell me, how does it feel to have your reputation constantly hanging by a thread?”
“Me, when will you and Mr. Higgins tie the knot? Be sure to let us know, okay? Patrick and I would love to attend your wedding and celebrate your special day with you.”
It was Blaine’s face that dimmed at her words. He had spent enough time socializing to recognize a sugar-coated jab when he heard one. Hailey’s remark was dripping with venom, and he wasn’t about to let it slide. He cut in before Sadie could reply.
“That reminds me, I’ve heard a few things as well. Something about Ms. Burgess and Mr. Noel living separately these days?”
Blaine cocked his head to the side as if rifling through his memory, then suddenly put a hand to his mouth, and his expression morphed from curious to alarmed.
“Surely not… Is a divorce looming on the horizon? I suppose being the perfect couple in front of the cameras doesn’t necessarily translate to real life, huh?”
“Hey!” Hailey’s cheeks flushed with indignation.

###Chapter 1005:
This shameless libertine! How dare he air her dirty laundry in public?
Sadie couldn’t be bothered to stick around for another minute. She calmly stood, not even glancing at Hailey as she said, “If there’s nothing else, Ms. Burgess, we’ll be taking our leave now.”
But she didn’t wait for Hailey to respond. She grabbed Blaine by the wrist and turned toward the exit.
Hailey stared after them, a glint of malice in her eyes.
Leave? Not so fast!
“Ms. Hudson! Let me walk you out.” Hailey shot to her feet and rushed after them.
Just as she reached the pair, she stumbled as if tripping on something, and fell backward with a dramatic cry. “Ah!”
A collective gasp of horror went around the cafe, followed by murmurs of concern.
Hailey clutched her stomach, her face pale and twisted in pain.noveldrama
She looked up at Sadie with a pitiful expression and spoke in a loud, trembling voice. “Ms. Hudson… I know you’re upset with me because of Noah, but… How can you shove me like that? I’m pregnant with his baby!”
Sadie’s brows drew together, and a soft scoff of disbelief left her lips. She hadn’t even touched Hailey.
By then, the commotion had attracted the attention of the cafe’s patrons, and most of them had gathered around to watch the spectacle unfold more closely.
“Isn’t that Ms. Hudson from the Wall Group?”
“Oh, my god, did she really push that woman?”
Fresh chapters live gαlnσν?s?com
“Has she stolen someone’s husband?”
“It seems so! And she’s even getting physical with a pregnant woman? Does she have no heart at all?”
Blaine frowned when he heard the busybodies’ comments. Meanwhile, Hailey was crying in earnest, the very picture of a weak and helpless young woman.
Blaine muttered a curse under his breath. With acting chops like that, Hailey might as well be awarded Best Actress of the Year.
He couldn’t believe Sadie had to deal with this kind of circus on a regular basis. Poor girl. And Noah—God help him—had to bear the curse of being tied to someone like Hailey.
Blaine looked around the cafe, his eyes pausing briefly at the corners of the ceiling. He raised a perfectly arched brow.
“A place this big doesn’t even have a single security camera? Where is the staff of this establishment?”
His words seemed to snap someone into action. A waiter, who had been trying to stay invisible behind the counter, hurried over with a sheepish smile and a respectful bow.
“I’m terribly sorry about this. Our surveillance system went down yesterday and is still under repair.”
.

###Chapter 1006:
Hailey’s tear-soaked expression faltered, just for a heartbeat. A wave of joy surged within her. It felt like even the universe was on her side. Tears streamed even faster, though now they were laced with something that almost looked like relief.
“Ms. Hudson…” Her voice cracked as she tried to speak. Choking on the weight of her own words, she added, “Please… I’m begging you. Don’t hurt the child I’m carrying. It… it’s done nothing wrong.”
One of her trembling hands rested over her stomach, a gesture that made her look more fragile than ever.
“I’ll leave Noah. Right now, if that’s what you want,” she continued, her voice trembling with conviction. “You’ll never see me again. I’ll disappear—for good. Just… please let me go, Ms. Hudson.” There seemed to be no pretense in her tone, only raw desperation.
Gasps echoed through the onlookers who had remained watchful.
“This is unbelievable…”
“She’s pregnant? And Ms. Hudson is still going after her like this?”
“Seriously? Ms. Hudson always looked so polished. I didn’t think she could be so heartless.”
“Isn’t she the mistress? How did she turn this around?”
“Just because she runs Wall Group doesn’t give her the right to treat people like trash.”
“This is straight-up abuse of power!”
“Boycott Wall Group! With someone like her at the top, the company is destined to go downhill.”
In the face of the sudden onslaught of criticism, Sadie didn’t flinch. Not once. Instead, she smiled.
Gal n o v el s . com is your destination for fiction
With slow, deliberate steps, she closed the distance between herself and Hailey, who remained on the floor, putting on a performance like she carried the grief of every woman on earth.
Then something unexpected happened—Sadie extended her hand.
“Ms. Burgess, the floor must be freezing,” said Sadie with calm poise. “Let’s get you up first. We’ll talk after.”
The sobbing stopped in an instant. Hailey blinked, visibly rattled by the unexpected kindness. Wasn’t Sadie supposed to be angry or embarrassed? What was she trying to do?
Confusion curled in her gut, laced with unease. What was Sadie really doing? With every eye in the cafe trained on her, Hailey found herself cornered. If she refused the gesture, she’d look petty and ungrateful.
Her gaze flicked to the spectators. Their expressions told her everything—she had no choice but to play along. Slowly, she reached out, her hand cold and reluctant.
Sadie grasped it firmly, her grip steady but not forceful, and guided Hailey back onto her feet. There was a slight wobble as Hailey stood upright. The warmth in that touch unsettled her more than she had expected.
.
.noveldrama
.
###Chapter 1007:
An invisible thread of tension pulled tight as Sadie let go. A moment passed—and then she smiled. Slight. Measured. Sharp enough to prick.
“Ms. Burgess, if I caught that right…” Sadie’s head tilted ever so slightly, her voice cool but curious. “Did you mention Noah’s name just now? Noah… my late husband?”
The name landed like a blow to Hailey’s chest.
Hailey froze. Her throat tightened. Not a single word made it out.
What had Sadie just said?
From every corner of the cafe, stunned silence spread like a ripple. People looked to one another, eyes wide with disbelief. Noah? That Noah? The man who used to run Wall Group—Noah Wall?noveldrama
Whispers broke out as soon as the name sank in. Plenty in the crowd had heard it before.
Noah Wall—gone but not forgotten. So why was Hailey calling her husband “Noah?” What exactly was going on here?
Murmurs of doubt rippled through the audience, the tone shifting from outrage to uncertainty.
Hailey stood rooted in place, like lightning had struck her nerves and left her motionless.
Never in her wildest thoughts had she expected Sadie to strike with such precision.
She had been the one weaving a scene, yet now she found herself exposed in the most public way. Acknowledging that the “Noah” she spoke of was that Noah, Wall Group’s deceased CEO, was out of the question.
The timing couldn’t have been more disastrous. One slip, and everything she’d worked for would unravel in front of everyone. Her cheeks flushed scarlet, a mix of humiliation and panic coloring her face.
ρα  ? ν
Trying to explain herself now would only look like a desperate cover-up—it would reek of damage control.
Lowering her head, she clenched her jaw as if to trap the shame from spilling out. Her entire body burned with the weight of it.
She could not take it. Without saying a word, she turned abruptly and shoved through the crowd, as if she couldn’t escape fast enough. Behind her, Sadie slowly relaxed her hand, her fingers unfurling with quiet satisfaction.
Dropping the “late husband” line had been no accident—it was a deliberate, strategic strike.
She had placed her bet on Hailey’s silence, counting on her to crumble rather than confess. And judging by that retreat, her gamble had paid off.
Hailey obviously had a guilty conscience and didn’t have the guts to bite back.
If people somehow connected the dots between Noah and Patrick and realized what she had done, the fallout would be catastrophic.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1008:
Luckily, Sadie had managed to bluff her way through. For now, anyway. She forced herself to stay calm, then turned to address the stunned patrons.
“Everyone,” Sadie said, her tone steady and slightly apologetic. “I’m truly sorry for the disruption. This was supposed to be a personal matter. As an apology, I would like to cover everyone’s bill.”
The chatter in the cafe died down, then all at once, everyone broke into light applause.
Free drinks and desserts? Who would refuse that deal? First, they were treated to some drama, and now they were getting literal treats? They had practically hit the jackpot!
“How incredibly generous of Ms. Hudson!”
“I know! Not only is she gorgeous, but she is very gracious, too!”
“That other woman was so absurd, twisting the story around like that!”
“Right? She didn’t seem like a good person at all.”
Just like that, everyone was rallying behind Sadie, and Hailey’s accusations were forgotten. All they could talk about now was Sadie’s magnanimity.
Sadie just smiled and nodded in thanks as they offered kind words and praises.
At some point, Blaine sidled up next to her again. Judging by his expression, his mood had cooled off, if only a little.
Once Sadie finished making the arrangements with the waiter, she ushered him to the door. “Let’s go.”
The pair walked out of the establishment side by side.
Without warning, Blaine stopped short, his eyes narrowed into slits.
  g?ν
Sadie tilted her head to the side, her brows furrowed as she asked, “What is it?”
Blaine shoved his hands into his trouser pockets and whipped around to face her.
Sadie felt her heart skip a beat at his sharp, questioning gaze.
“Sadie,” Blaine began slowly, as though he were choosing his words carefully. “Be honest with me. You’ve been hung up on Noah all these years.” He paused to peer at her more closely. “And what—have you now moved on to Patrick? But then again, you spoke of your late husband… Does that mean—”
Sadie’s face changed when she realized what he was about to say. She lunged forward and slapped her hand over Blaine’s mouth before he could get the rest of his words out.
Her eyes darted around, her heart racing. Thankfully, they were standing in a rather isolated spot. No one could have overheard their conversation.
Blaine had almost spilled everything!
Sadie shot him a warning look, even as her lips curled into a strained half-smile.
“What are you even talking about?” she whispered, torn between panic and frustration. “Stop thinking absurd thoughts. You’re reading into something that isn’t there.”
.

.noveldrama
###Chapter 1009:
Then she dropped her hand and straightened her clothes. “Don’t you have work to do? You should head back.”
Blaine raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by her agitation. There was a knowing gleam in his eyes, but he refrained from pushing her any further.
Instead, he glanced at his watch and obliged her. “You’re right. I guess I should go. Well, then. Take care.”
He gave Sadie a small nod and one last, meaningful look before walking toward his car. Sadie watched him disappear inside his vehicle and let out a long exhale. That was close.
Pulling herself together, she hiked her purse higher on her shoulder and got into the black car waiting at the curb.
As she did so, she failed to notice the figure that stepped out from behind a tree just down the street.
It was Hailey. She had come back.
Hailey glared in Sadie’s direction as the car drove off, her hands clenched at her sides.
That loathsome woman, humiliating her in public like that! She swore she would make Sadie pay for today’s incident.
No sooner had Hailey made this vow than something else occurred to her.
What was Sadie doing at the obstetrics department? Was she hiding some kind of private issue?
No, it didn’t seem likely. With how healthy and radiant Sadie looked earlier, there was no way she was having issues in that department. Something didn’t feel right, and it nagged at Hailey like a fishbone stuck in her throat. She had to get to the bottom of this.
Without a second thought, she hailed a cab and went straight to the hospital Sadie had just left. The lobby was bustling with people.
? ? ?: g?ν．
Being no stranger to the place, Hailey made a beeline for the nurse’s station at the obstetrics department.
By the time she reached it, her expression had changed dramatically—her eyes were wide, and her face was tight with worry.
“Excuse me, miss,” she said, leaning over the counter, her voice urgent. “Did a woman named Sadie Hudson come in for a check-up earlier?”
The nurse looked up and frowned in confusion. “I’m sorry, but you are…”
Hailey quickly swiped at her dry eyes. “I’m her cousin,” she said, tapping her palm against her chest. “I just heard she might have been admitted and rushed over as soon as I could. I’m really worried about her. Can you tell me what’s wrong with her? Is it serious?”
The nurse studied Hailey for a moment. After noting the resemblance between the two women and her apparent concern, she was somehow convinced that Hailey really was Sadie’s cousin.
.
.noveldrama
.
###Chapter 1010:
She turned to her screen, saying, “Try not to worry. I’m sure your cousin is fine.”
After a brief search through the records, she found Sadie’s file and checked her diagnosis.
The nurse’s face lit up, and she gave Hailey a warm smile. “It’s nothing bad. It’s good news, actually. Your cousin is pregnant, just a little over four weeks along. She just needs to take better care of herself.”
Hailey froze, her face going blank. Her brain shut down. Sadie was pregnant? But that was impossible. Whose baby…
Noah’s!
It had to be Noah’s! Who else could it be?
Hailey blinked and snapped back to her senses. She turned abruptly and walked away without even thanking the nurse. She felt like she had just been hit by a truck, and her mind was still reeling.
The nurse could only click her tongue and shake her head. What kind of reaction was that? Was that the proper response to news that a beloved cousin was expecting? What a strange woman.
The nurse didn’t pay any more attention to the matter and got back to work.
Meanwhile, Hailey wandered aimlessly outside the hospital.noveldrama
There was only one thought in her mind, and it kept playing over and over again—she was finished.
Sadie was pregnant with Noah’s baby! What was she supposed to do now?
Hailey halted in her steps, her heart thudding dully inside her chest.
  ? .
Was Noah aware of the pregnancy?
Considering his recent fixation on Sadie, surely he wouldn’t let her go to the hospital all by herself if he knew she was carrying his child.
But Sadie had gone alone. That meant Noah didn’t know.
Yes! He still had no idea!
Hailey grasped at that sliver of hope and clung to it for dear life.
No matter what else happened, Noah must never know about the child. If he found out, Hailey knew that he would drop everything and run back to Sadie—and their little family.
If that happened, everything she had worked hard for, everything she had sacrificed over the years… they would all go up in smoke.
Hailey stepped into her quiet estate, her features drained and eyes glassy with unease.
Forest was standing in front of the mirror in the foyer, straightening his collar, readying himself for a formal gathering. The instant his gaze met hers, his posture shifted, worry flashing across his face.
He crossed the space briskly.

Message from Noah: Wishing you, dear loved ones, a great day. God loves you and Noah whishes you all the best. ?(?  ? – ? ) ?

###Chapter 1011:noveldrama
“Hailey? What’s wrong? You look terrible.”
His attention darted to her midsection. “What did the doctor say? Is the child alright?”
Hailey didn’t speak. Instead, she moved toward the sofa, folded into one end of it, and sat stiffly.
Forest began pacing, the tension rising in his shoulders.
“What happened? Say something!” he urged, his tone cracking. “Is the baby okay?”
Hailey slowly raised her head. Her eyes were rimmed with sorrow, and her mouth moved like she wanted to speak—but couldn’t.
“It’s over, Dad.”
Forest stared, confused. “What do you mean by that? Hailey, explain!” Dread tightened in his chest. Had there been a miscarriage?
Hailey studied his face, then abruptly stood. Her voice came out jagged and alarmed, like a scream trapped for too long.
“Sadie’s expecting! That snake—she’s carrying Noah’s baby! It has to be his!”
She gestured wildly, nearly knocking over a lamp. Her voice trembled. “If he finds out, I’m done. He’ll pick her—and their child—over me.” She dropped back into the sofa, her body folding inward. “Everything’s crumbling. It’s all slipping away.”
Forest went still, stunned as though he’d been struck.
Sadie was pregnant? With Noah’s child?
His mouth parted, words delayed by disbelief. “How… how could that happen?”
Then another realization hit. “Did Noah regain his memory?”
 erfe? 
check g?νm
Hailey’s eyes dulled. “Not yet,” she murmured. “But it won’t be long.”
Forest leaned forward slightly, trying to ground her spiraling thoughts. “Listen, don’t lose your head. So what if Sadie’s pregnant? You’re pregnant too. And you’re Noah’s spouse. Even if his memories return—”
A guttural cry broke from Hailey’s throat, halting his words. “No! That’s a lie!”
Her face blanched further, panic swelling in her eyes.
“The baby I’m carrying—it’s not Noah’s. It’s Sutton’s. That worthless fool’s.”
She wrapped her arms around herself. She’d never gotten the chance to end the pregnancy—Noah had discovered it too soon.
Everything had spiraled out of control before she could undo it. She’d buried that truth deep within, like a lit fuse—and now it was seconds from exploding.
Forest remained frozen, overwhelmed by the revelation. His expression mirrored Hailey’s from moments earlier.
Sutton? That failure? The one the Wall family had disowned? And his daughter was pregnant with his child?
A shadow settled over Forest. His balance faltered.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1012:
It was shattered—everything. Really over. All their plans, all their aspirations had been founded on a deception.
If Noah’s memories returned or if he found out the truth about the baby, everything would just disintegrate.
Forest inhaled unevenly, fighting to remain composed.
He raised a hand, signaling Hailey to stop spiraling.
This wasn’t the time to fall apart.
“Breathe, Hailey,” he rasped. “We’re not cornered yet. There’s still a path ahead.”
Hailey laughed—a sound like shattered glass. Her glare was scathing. “A path? What now—you’re going to ‘handle’ Sadie for me?”
Forest dropped his eyes under her withering look.
Handle Sadie? God, he wished he could. But could he afford to? She wasn’t just anyone. She led the Wall Group now, with the Higgins and Castro families behind her.
Move against her, and you might as well dig your own grave.
When Hailey saw him recoil, her expression froze into something icier. She had always known what kind of person her father was.
Eager to bask in triumph. Quicker to vanish when things went south.
Never the one to take the real fall.
Depend on him? Laughable.
Forest cleared his throat, visibly uneasy.
“We can’t try to get rid of Sadie outright. She’s too powerful. It’s reckless.”
   ν
But something flickered behind his eyes—an idea blooming.
“But there’s still another way. As long as we keep Noah near—as long as his past stays buried—none of this changes. Let Sadie have her baby. Let her stand alone. As long as his memories don’t return, you’re still his wife.”
Hailey’s final glimmer of faith dimmed into nothing.
She’d mulled over this route before, but Evan had flatly declined to lend a hand.
The man was elusive—always vanishing when needed, offering cryptic reassurances. He refused to get involved in anything related to Noah ever again.
Now, no one remained who could sustain the mental suppression process that prevented Noah from remembering his past.noveldrama
While she remained wordless, Forest misread her silence as hesitation and swiftly proposed something even more extreme.
“Hailey, there is… another path,” he said, lowering his voice, eyes alight with a dangerous sort of enthusiasm. “I recently caught wind of an unapproved method from abroad. It involves embedding a synthetic memory unit directly into the brain. Allegedly, it can overwrite someone’s entire recollection—replace it with whatever narrative we design.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1013:
Hailey’s gaze jerked upward. She was stunned.
A memory unit? Overwrite someone’s entire recollection? She vaguely recalled hearing whispers of such tech before, but…
“Isn’t that still experimental?” she asked quietly, brows knitting in concern.
“What if something malfunctions? What if there are… lasting effects? What would happen to Noah?”
But Forest only grew more energized, his smile turning grim with dark intent.
“A malfunction would be ideal,” he hissed, leaning closer. “Think about it. If he ends up comatose—or better, doesn’t survive—then you’re his bereaved spouse. And you’re carrying his heir. The elders in the Wall family wouldn’t dare cast you aside. For that child’s sake, they’d back you completely. Eventually, you’d hold the reins of the Wall Group.”
He paused, his expression calculating. “And if it works? Then he’s yours alone. Sadie vanishes from his mind like she never existed. He’ll only see you. At that point, both he and the business are in our pockets. Either way, we win. It’s a high-stakes bet—with nothing but upside.”
Hailey’s pulse thundered in her ears.
As twisted as it sounded, the plan was nearly foolproof. Whichever direction things turned, it would secure her place—and that of her family.
Still, her stomach twisted. Brain operations weren’t a game. The dangers weren’t theoretical.
Noticing her faltering, Forest grew anxious.
His daughter had everything—charm, intelligence, drive—but always second-guessed at the final stretch.
  : ν﹒
How was she supposed to pull off something big if she couldn’t make hard calls?
“Hailey! We can’t afford to wait anymore!” His tone cracked like a whip. “Sadie’s expecting! Noah could find out about that any moment! The longer we wait, the riskier this gets. Are you really going to let him return to her and throw everything we’ve fought for into the dirt?”
Hailey didn’t reply. Her hands clutched her sleeves tightly, knuckles pale, the fabric trembling.
Seeing this, Forest picked up on her inner conflict and switched tactics. His voice dropped, gentler now, more personal.
“Hailey, have you blocked out what went down three years back? Our family hit rock bottom. The business was collapsing, and the world mocked us—treated us like filth. Have you truly erased how crushing that was? We only got to stand up again because of Noah. Do you want to be broken like that again, powerless and disgraced?”
That sting—Hailey remembered every bit of it. The burning humiliation, the fury masked as silence—she vowed never to relive that nightmare. Her chin lifted abruptly, uncertainty vanishing from her expression, now hardened with fierce purpose. Fingers curled tightly, pressing crescent-shaped marks into her skin.

###Chapter 1014:
Failure wasn’t an option. She wouldn’t lose. She had fought her way up from the wreckage—and she wouldn’t let Sadie shatter it all.
“Alright,” she said, voice low but cutting. “We’ll play it your way. But Dad—we must track down the top specialist. Someone reliable. We can’t afford a single misstep.”
Forest’s eyes gleamed with triumph when his daughter finally agreed to his plan.
“Don’t worry. I’ve got it,” he said, tapping Hailey’s arm with calm assurance. “You can trust me. I’ve already secured a specialist—absolutely reliable.”
At last, Hailey exhaled softly, the tension in her shoulders loosening.
As long as she could keep Noah tethered and make sure he could never leave her, that cursed Sadie and the unborn child she carried wouldn’t stand in her way.
Meanwhile, Sadie was in her car, her fingers gripping the steering wheel tighter than usual.
A strange tension sat in her chest, like a storm on the horizon.
Her phone screen lit up beside her.
At a red light, she snatched it quickly.
A brief text from Samuel popped up: “Ms. Hudson, Patrick is the new occupant at Autumn Garden Villa.”
Patrick.
Noah.
Her hand tightened around the device until her knuckles whitened, eyes narrowing as her blood turned to ice.
He was like a ghost she could never exorcise—always showing up everywhere she went. What was he up to now?
g?lnσν?s?com, the heart of storytelling
The light turned green.
She inhaled sharply, tossed the phone aside, and pressed down on the pedal.
If he thought she’d play along again, he was in for a rude awakening.noveldrama
Moments later, her glossy black vehicle glided into Myrtlewood Estate. She pulled into her regular space and stepped out, catching a glimpse of the gardener nearby. He was trimming roses but looked unusually tense, like he wanted to speak up but held back.
What was going on? Sadie’s brow creased, but she said nothing.
Instead, she strode straight through the entrance.
The moment she pushed open the door, she stopped mid-step. Noah lounged on the sofa as if it were his own, sipping casually from a mug. He looked completely at home. Jack stood nearby, visibly tense and awkward.
Sadie blinked and quickly composed herself. Her mouth twisted into a frosty smile, her voice laced with mockery. “Well, well. Trespassing now, Mr. Noel? Even for you, that’s bold.”
Noah, unfazed, set his mug down gently and turned toward her, a smug curve playing at the corner of his mouth.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1015:
“Sadie, that’s a little harsh. I just moved in and thought I’d greet my neighbor. Imagine my surprise—it’s you.”
Sadie almost laughed. The audacity was stunning. Everyone in Jazmah knew her address. He hadn’t even bothered to make his excuse sound believable.
She dismissed him completely, turning her attention to Breck with sharp precision. “Breck, escort him out.”
“Hold on—please!” Noah rose quickly, approaching her. His confident mask faltered, just slightly. “Okay, look. I just moved in, and I’m still unpacking. The house is a mess, and I haven’t hired a housekeeper yet… I figured maybe you—”
Sadie interrupted him mid-sentence, her expression unreadable but resolute. She already knew where this conversation was going.noveldrama
Leech off her? Not happening.
“No.” The word was sharp and final, like the cut of a blade.
Noah stiffened, a flicker of pain in his gaze. Did she despise him that much?
She didn’t even glance his way. Instead, her focus shifted to Jack, who looked as if he wished he could disappear into the sofa.
A slow, taunting smirk curled on her lips.
“What’s the matter, Mr. Noel? Is your assistant here just for aesthetics now? Can’t manage something this basic on your own?”
Noah blinked, momentarily thrown off. As his gaze followed Sadie’s, the message clicked.
He coughed awkwardly, straightening his posture. “Jack’s out of commission. Shattered his arm. He’s not exactly running at full capacity.”
He flicked Jack a look that clearly meant: play along.
Jack sighed inwardly but understood.
Clutching his arm, he crouched, contorting his features in mock pain.
“Ah! My arm! It’s killing me! My leg too! Ms. Hudson, in case you didn’t know, I had a nasty tumble down the stairs a while back. Busted my arm. Doctor ordered total rest. I’m in no condition to support Mr. Noel.”
Sadie observed their pitiful act, barely holding in a scoff.
This was their plan? This flimsy charade? Did they really think she’d fall for such amateur theatrics?
Her smile faded. Icy detachment replaced it.
“Then you absolutely shouldn’t remain under this roof. If something happens to you while you’re here, guess who’s responsible?”
She raised her chin slightly, her voice calm but commanding. “Get out. Now. Or I’ll have the security team handle it.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1016:
Noah looked at her frosty expression, his insides knotting. Outwardly, though, he kept his usual bravado, refusing to let it show.
He didn’t think she’d actually follow through. They had history, didn’t they? He still wore that smug, self-assured look.
Sadie caught it—that presumptuous glint—and felt her patience vanish. She pivoted silently and ascended the stairs.
Noah watched her leave, dread starting to set in. Then, without thinking, he called after her. “Sadie, want something specific for dinner? I’ll cook!”
No response. Sadie didn’t so much as hesitate.
Slam! The master bedroom door upstairs shut with finality.
Noah remained by the stairs, dumbfounded. Sadie’s coldness stung more than expected. Helpless fury simmered beneath his skin.
Then he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned, and found himself facing two tall, stone-faced bodyguards in black suits.
Jack was already restrained, a cloth crammed into his mouth.
Noah was speechless. Seriously? Was this actually happening?noveldrama
Before he could protest, the bodyguards seized him by both arms.
Moments later, Noah and Jack were hurled out of Myrtlewood Estate.
Crash! The iron gate clanged shut behind them.
Jack landed hard on the stone drive, wincing in pain. He groaned, humiliated. This was the lowest point yet. He… Patrick Noel’s trusted aide—thrown out like yesterday’s trash.
He peered at his disheveled boss, a lump forming in his throat. “Boss, I’m guessing Ms. Hudson’s not exactly thrilled to see us.”
  @ ν?
Noah’s jaw clenched. That remark hit a nerve. He threw Jack a glare sharp enough to draw blood.
What nonsense was that? Of course, he noticed. The woman was a fortress.
Charging in headfirst clearly wouldn’t cut it. He’d need a different plan. He exhaled slowly, rubbing his temples, then turned and strode off toward the Autumn Garden Villa.
Meanwhile, upstairs—Sadie stood beside the tall window, peering through a sliver between the drapes.
She watched Noah and Jack leave, the defeat unmistakable. Her brow furrowed slightly.
One hand drifted to her lower abdomen, fingers resting gently.
What exactly was Noah playing at?
He returned to Jazmah early, abandoned Hailey, moved in next door—and now barged into her home like he still had a right?

###Chapter 1017:
What was his goal? Reconciliation? Manipulation?
Her lips curled into a cold grin. Without another thought, she yanked the curtains shut.
Out of sight. Out of mind.
Sadie’s vision swam as she stumbled back to her bedroom, her strength evaporating with each unsteady step.
She teetered on her feet momentarily before tumbling onto the plush mattress, her limbs heavy as stone.
Her eyelids drooped, consciousness slipping away like water through fingers as she surrendered to an unexpected slumber.
By evening, at Autumn Garden Villa, as amber sunlight poured through the floor-to-ceiling windows, bathing the living room in a honeyed glow, Noah lingered by the window, tracking the sky’s gradual transformation from azure to indigo.
He narrowed his eyes, attention drawn to the luminous villa neighboring his own.
The sharp memory of today’s dismissal still pricked at his pride, refusing to fade.noveldrama
Sadie had clearly developed a bolder streak.
Yet paradoxically, her resistance only magnified her allure, each defiant gesture making her more fascinating.
A subtle smile played across Noah’s lips as an idea blossomed in his mind, taking root with surprising tenacity.
He squared his shoulders, smoothed the wrinkles from his collar with deliberate precision, and strode purposefully toward the exit.
At that moment, Jack bustled through the door, arms laden with takeout bags emblazoned with the distinctive Nilvana emblem. He’d ventured across town specifically to fetch dinner for his boss—and naturally, secured a portion for himself as well.
Your favorite stories are on g?lnσνes?c?m
As he crossed the threshold into the foyer, he saw Noah was heading toward the door.
Jack halted abruptly. “Boss, where are you going?”
Noah’s gaze darted to the fragrant bags clutched in Jack’s hands, his expression brightening. Impeccable timing. He advanced swiftly and took the packages.
“I’m paying my neighbor a considerate visit,” he announced with nonchalant ease, leaving Jack rooted to the spot, jaw slackened in disbelief.
Was his boss serious? Sadie’s security detail had unceremoniously ejected them mere hours ago—and now his boss was voluntarily returning to the scene of their humiliation?
And his boss had gone there with his meticulously selected dinner, no less!
A silent groan reverberated through Jack’s mind. Daily existence proved exhausting under a boss who treated established protocols as mere suggestions rather than binding directives.
With shoulders slumped in surrender, he hastened after Noah’s determined stride.

###Chapter 1018:
Jack couldn’t permit Noah to venture there unaccompanied. If another ejection occurred, someone needed to preserve his dignity—and possibly cushion his landing.
When they arrived at Myrtlewood Estate’s grand entryway, Noah’s features glowed with an unmistakable radiance, his confident smile illuminating his entire countenance.
Before crossing the threshold, he announced his presence with theatrical volume. “Hey there, Sadie! I brought your favorite—Nirvana takeout!”
He sauntered into the living room with the casual confidence of a proprietor, swinging the aromatic bags triumphantly.
But the biting retort or icy stare he’d braced himself for never materialized.
An unusual stillness permeated the expansive room, broken only by the hushed movements of household staff attending to their duties with somber efficiency.
Breck, the normally composed butler, prowled nervously across the center of the room, his worried gaze repeatedly drawn to the sweeping staircase.
An unsettling current of wrongness electrified the atmosphere. Noah’s cheerful expression dissolved as he approached the agitated butler. “Breck, what’s happened here?”
Breck’s features flooded with relief at Noah’s appearance as he hurried forward, anxiety threading through his usually steady voice.
“Mr. Noel, providence itself must have sent you! Ms. Hudson retreated upstairs hours ago and hasn’t emerged since. Dinner hour has long passed, and she remains unresponsive to my knocking. Something dreadful whispers at my instincts…”
Noah’s pulse faltered momentarily as jagged apprehension seized his chest.

Beneath Sadie’s formidable exterior lurked a fragility she zealously concealed—her health had always seemed to teeter precariously. With barely a conscious thought, he thrust the warm packages into Breck’s unprepared arms and bounded up the staircase two steps at a time, making a beeline for the master suite.
He hammered his fist against the door, his heartbeat thundering in his ears.
“Sadie! Open this door immediately!”
The answering silence hung heavy as a shroud.
Noah’s forehead creased with deepening concern, unease crystallizing in his mind.
What was happening inside? Had disaster befallen her?
He retreated slightly, positioned himself strategically, and launched a powerful kick precisely at the door’s weakest point near the lock. The explosive crack of splintering wood punctuated the silence as the substantial door flew inward on protesting hinges.noveldrama
Noah charged through the opening without a moment’s pause, adrenaline propelling him forward.
Twilight shadows engulfed the bedroom, heavy curtains barricading any attempt at natural light.

###Chapter 1019:noveldrama
On the vast bed, Sadie’s diminutive form huddled beneath layers of blankets, occasional tremors betraying her distress.
Noah hastened to her bedside and pressed his palm against her forehead with uncharacteristic gentleness.
Her skin radiated alarming heat—fever had clearly taken fierce hold of her.
His features clouded with frustration and concern. Why did she persistently neglect her own wellbeing? Wordlessly, he gathered her limp form against his chest and pivoted toward the exit with purposeful strides.
At that precise moment, Breck and Jack appeared in the doorway, their expressions freezing into identical masks of alarm.
“Ms. Hudson!”
“Boss!” Jack blurted, startled by the severity of the situation.
They stumbled over themselves following Noah’s determined path, naked fear etched across their features.
Noah descended the staircase with swift, measured steps, cradling Sadie’s fevered form against him as he navigated directly toward the main entrance.
With meticulous care, he arranged her across the vehicle’s back seat before vaulting into the driver’s position with singular focus.
The engine roared to life with a guttural snarl as the sleek black vehicle surged forward, carving a desperate path toward the exclusive medical facility nearby.
The car hurtled through city streets at a velocity that blurred the passing scenery into indistinct smears of color.
Jack followed in a second car, his white-knuckled hands gripping the steering wheel as anxiety coursed through his veins.
The VIP hospital suite carried the characteristic clinical scent—sterile antiseptic mingled with understated luxury.
After a comprehensive evaluation, the physician draped his stethoscope around his neck and addressed Noah with professional composure.
“Mr. Noel, your concern is understandable but unwarranted. Ms. Hudson exhibits symptoms of a standard fever—likely due to excessive fatigue. There’s nothing perilous. Intravenous hydration and proper rest will restore her completely.”
Only after hearing this diagnosis did Noah exhale the breath he had unconsciously held. The constriction in his chest loosened, and the tension he hadn’t fully realized he was carrying began to fade. She would recover fully.
As the physician departed, silence reclaimed the room.
Noah claimed the chair beside Sadie’s bedside, his vigil unwavering.
Sadie’s complexion remained alarmingly pale, her forehead creased with tension even in unconsciousness.
If he’d arrived any later… the potential consequences loomed too grim to contemplate.

###Chapter 1020:
The door opened quietly as Breck entered, anxiety still etched in the lines around his eyes.
“Mr. Noel, perhaps you should consider returning home for proper rest? I can maintain vigilance over Ms. Hudson’s condition,” Breck suggested gently.
The unspoken subtext hung heavily between them. Noah’s marital status made an overnight vigil at another woman’s sickbed potentially inappropriate—and scandalous.
Noah kept his gaze downward, his fingers instinctively tightening their protective grip around Sadie’s limp hand.
“That won’t be necessary,” he replied calmly, his tone brooking no contradiction. “You’re dismissed for the evening.” He flicked a meaningful glance.
Noah turned toward Jack, who hovered uncertainly at the threshold, the same moral turmoil evident in his expression. “The same applies to you.”
Breck and Jack shared a moment of silent understanding, mutual resignation reflected in their exchanged glances.
When Noah made a decision, attempting to change his course proved invariably futile.
Acknowledging defeat, they offered respectful nods before quietly retreating from the hospital suite.
The door whispered shut behind them, creating a sanctuary free from external judgments and prying eyes.
Noah redirected his full attention to Sadie’s vulnerable form, his fingers entwining with hers in a protective gesture that spoke volumes his words never could.noveldrama
The next morning, Sadie’s lashes fluttered as she slowly blinked into wakefulness.
g?lnσν?s?com is where dreams unfold
She was first greeted by the wide expanse of the stark white ceiling. Her body felt drained of strength, her limbs heavy, and her mind cloudy.
This… Was she in a hospital? What happened to her last night? Her memory was patchy at best. She remembered feeling terrible, then everything went black.
She gingerly turned her head to the side, and her gaze landed on the figure slouched on the edge of the bed, fast asleep. His profile was just as sharp as she remembered, his features chiseled and well-defined, though his brows were furrowed slightly.
Noah?
Sadie stared at him in shock. What was he doing here?
Her thoughts were still a little muddled, so she couldn’t quite think clearly.
She shifted positions and tried to reach for the glass of water on the bedside table. But her movements—small as they were—were enough to rouse the sleeping man.
Noah’s eyes were glassy with sleep as he lifted his head, but they instantly snapped into focus when he saw that Sadie was awake.
“You’re awake?” he rasped. “What are you trying to do? Do you need me to carry you to the bathroom?” He was already getting to his feet as he spoke.

###Chapter 1021:
Sadie blinked, caught off-guard by the worry in his voice. Wasn’t he being a little too dramatic?
Her gaze dropped instinctively to her still-flat stomach.
Noah was likely unaware of her pregnancy yet. Otherwise, given his current feelings toward her, he would have already forced her to get rid of the baby.
Then an idea crossed her mind. She decided to test whether he knew about her pregnancy or not.
She sank back into the pillows and did her best to look frail and weak.
“What… What happened to me?” she asked softly.
Noah braced his elbows on the bed and leaned in to peer at her face.
The faint scent of lavender and something unmistakably his lingered in the air between them. It wafted over to Sadie and practically wrapped around her, as if to lay claim.noveldrama
The scent brought a rush of feelings and memories from the past, causing her to briefly lose focus.
Thankfully, Noah didn’t seem to notice her reaction to his proximity. He reached out and pressed his large, warm palm against her forehead.
“You’re okay now. The fever broke.”
A soft breath of relief rushed past his lips, but then he frowned again. “You had a high fever. Don’t you remember anything? Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere now? I’ll call the doctor.” He was already turning toward the door.
“Wait!” Sadie grabbed his arm without thinking.
Finish the chapters at g?ν?s. o
She hadn’t meant for him to actually call the doctor. What if they found something other than her fever?
Noah stopped in his tracks, clearly surprised by the sudden touch. Then he pivoted on his feet—so quickly that he lost balance at the last second and found himself tipping forward.
The next thing Sadie knew, a weight was about to press down on her.
His broad chest, his toned abdomen…
She stayed still, eyes wide open.
Fortunately, Noah caught himself just in time before he crushed her with his body. His hands were braced on either side of Sadie, their faces so close to each other that their noses were nearly touching. Sadie couldn’t look away. She could feel his warm breath fanning against her cheek.
Noah couldn’t stop staring, either—her luscious lips were parted slightly, her eyes wide with innocent surprise. His gaze darkened, and a teasing smile tugged at the corners of his mouth.
“Sadie,” he said, low and mischievous. “There’s really no need for you to try so hard to hang on to me…” He had more to say, but never got the chance to.
Sadie’s eyes suddenly flashed with anger. Without any warning, she jerked her knee upward.
.

###Chapter 1022:
Noah hadn’t been ready for it. The pain hit him like a tidal wave. He gasped as he fell back and doubled over, his hands cupping his crotch as if he feared another attack was coming.
Sadie hadn’t held back at all!
He was still trying to compose himself when she sat upright and straightened her clothes. Then she shot him a cold, distant glare. “I would appreciate some basic courtesy, Mr. Noel. In case you’ve forgotten, you are a married man. And for the record…” She paused and lifted her chin, her tone turning even colder. “I’m about to marry Nathan, so I would greatly appreciate it if you kept your distance from now on.”
Noah’s breath caught at her words. He froze, still clutching his crotch, as he processed Sadie’s declaration. The pain on his face was soon replaced with disbelief.
Her? Marry Nathan?
He looked up and searched her face, but there was no trace of hesitation there, only resolve. Sadie had meant every word.
Noah scowled. “You’re marrying Nathan Higgins? That spoiled trust fund kid who has nothing valuable apart from his last name?”
Sadie squared her shoulders and met his steely gaze. “Your opinion of Nathan is of no consequence. And who I choose to marry is none of your business, either.”
Her voice was calm, soft, even, but it felt as though she had slammed his head into a brick wall.
Meanwhile, in a high-rise building, Nathan was holding a meeting in the conference room when he suddenly let out a loud sneeze. He frowned and rubbed his nose. Why did it feel like someone was going to hurt him?
At that same moment, a hot surge of irrational rage flared in Noah’s chest.
g?ν.?n – ? ? ?
Nathan, that bastard!
Noah gritted his teeth and balled his hands into fists, barely resisting the urge to get rid of Nathan once and for all.
He should have taken care of that prick when he had the chance! But perhaps it wasn’t too late to do just that.
Noah’s lips curled into a cold, humorless smile. He stepped forward, his shadow stretching over Sadie as she lay rigid on the bed. His voice dropped, smooth and sharp with warning. “Is that so? Then brace yourself—what’s coming won’t be easy.” He leaned in, close enough that his breath grazed her ear. “Being a widow never is.”
Sadie shot him a sharp, silent glare—too drained to argue. She tossed the covers aside, snatched the folded clothes from the nightstand, and made to leave. But Noah moved faster. His hand closed around her wrist and tugged her back, folding her into his arms with quiet force.
His chest pressed against her back, steady and warm. He tousled her hair—clumsily, yet with a strange tenderness. “Just get some rest for now,” he murmured, his tone stripped of its earlier edge, low and almost tender. “You’ve just come out of a fever. Your body’s still fragile. Let yourself heal.”
He paused, fingers still curled around her wrist, then slowly let her go. “I’ll have the doctor check in again.”

###Chapter 1023:
Sadie didn’t move. Her hands stayed at her sides, clenched so tightly the blood fled her knuckles. His warmth still lingered on her skin—unwelcome, yet stubbornly present. She couldn’t explain it—why her body betrayed her silence, why she hadn’t recoiled from his grasp. Without a word, she eased back down onto the bed, the mattress sinking beneath her weight and uncertainty. Noah turned without another glance, leaving only the soft click of the door behind him.
Sadie stared after him, her face blank but her thoughts churning beneath the surface—guarded, tangled, unreadable. A buzz from her phone jolted her from the quiet.
It was Samuel. She grabbed the phone from the nightstand and answered. “Hello?” Samuel’s voice filtered through, calm and deliberate.
“Ms. Hudson, I’ve located the owner of the number. The woman is safe. We can move her discreetly to Jazmah tomorrow.”
A rush of air escaped Sadie’s lips—half relief, half disbelief. At last, a thread of order in the chaos.
“Thank you,” she said, her tone calm once more—authority flowing back into her voice like the return of a tide. “For now, settle that person in Rosehill Apartments. And ensure, without exception, that no one finds out.”
Her final words cut clean and quiet—controlled, but edged with unmistakable command.
Just then, the door swung open with a soft creak. Noah entered, a doctor a step behind. He paused, catching her last sentence midair. No one finds out? Finds out what? The words lingered like the tail of smoke after a gunshot—impossible to ignore.
His eyes locked on her, brows drawing slightly as suspicion flickered in his gaze. What secret was she guarding so fiercely?

The doctor stepped forward, clipboard in hand, breaking the tension with a courteous nod. He launched into the examination—routine questions, a check of Sadie’s vitals, the stethoscope cool against her skin. Noah remained to the side, arms folded across his chest, silent and unreadable. But Sadie could feel it—that steady, piercing scrutiny. The doctor straightened and turned toward Noah.
“Mr. Noel, Ms. Hudson’s recovering well,” the doctor said with professional calm. “Her fever’s completely broken. No complications. Just make sure she rests and sticks to a light diet.”
Noah gave a distracted nod. “Understood.”noveldrama
By the time he surfaced from his spiraling thoughts, the doctor was gone.
Sadie remained on the bed, her gaze fixed out the window—quiet, unmoved, as if Noah were no more than a ghost passing through her periphery.
His throat tightened. Words hovered on the edge of his tongue. He wanted to ask about the call. Who was she hiding? Who was she talking about?
But the cold line of her jaw, the steel in her posture, stopped him. Even if he asked, she wouldn’t tell him. She never did. And he was tired of the same bitter arguments that got them nowhere.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1024:noveldrama
Without another word, he turned and walked out, his footsteps muffled by the polished floor.
At the far end of the corridor, he pulled out his phone and dialed Jack. Jack picked up almost instantly. “Boss?”
“Dig into Sadie’s movements. Everything outside of work. I want details,” Noah said flatly, his voice low and frigid.
“Keep a close eye on any men she’s been in contact with,” Noah ordered, his voice clipped and frosted. “And assign someone to monitor Rosehill Apartments. Quietly. No mistakes. If anyone unusual shows up—any visitor you don’t recognize—I want to know immediately.”
There was a brief pause on the other end. Jack hesitated. Rosehill Apartments? Sadie had an apartment there. Was the boss… suspecting her? Still, he didn’t voice the question. Orders were orders. “Understood, boss. I’ll handle it.”
Noah hung up without another word. He remained in the corridor, silent, still—like a shadow carved into the sterile walls—his expression unreadable but charged with a storm beneath.
“Ensure, without exception, that no one finds out?” She was hiding someone in her apartment?
Each thread twisted tighter in Noah’s mind, forming a knot of suspicion he couldn’t ignore. Could Sadie be hiding a man?
The thought flashed like lightning—and he crushed it with brutal force. No. It couldn’t be. She was his. The woman he’d never stopped wanting. There was no room for anyone else.
And yet… If there was another man—someone foolish enough to touch what belonged to him—then that man had already sealed his fate.

Outside Rosehill Apartments, an inconspicuous black sedan sat in the shadows, its engine silent.
Inside, Jack massaged his stiff neck and flicked his gaze toward his watch for the dozenth time. He had been stationed here for nearly three hours without seeing a single person from Sadie’s team.
Jack struggled to comprehend his boss’s cryptic instructions, their purpose eluding him. His boss’s voice on the phone earlier had been ice-cold, vibrating with the restrained fury of a man ready to dismember someone with his bare hands.
Curiosity gnawed at Jack about what Sadie had done to warrant such extreme measures from his boss—surveillance, investigation of contacts—what game was she playing this time?
A hollow ache filled Jack’s belly, his stomach rumbling loudly in protest against the prolonged stakeout. He stretched his cramped limbs, joints popping in the confined space of the sedan.
With a sigh, he pushed open the car door, desperate for a quick bite from the convenience store gleaming at the corner.
Just then, two sleek black luxury cars glided into view, moving with deliberate purpose toward the gate of the community.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1025:
Jack froze mid-movement, his gaze instantly sharpening like a predator spotting prey. The license plates flashed recognition in his mind—Wall Group’s vehicles!noveldrama
A cocktail of excitement and dread surged through his veins, electrifying every nerve. He dove back into the car, slammed the door, and fired up the engine in one fluid, practiced motion.
The sequence unfolded with the precision of a veteran operative—lightning-fast and ghostly quiet.
With calculated movements, he adjusted the wheel and maintained a shadow’s distance as he tailed the luxury cars into the community.
Meanwhile, in the lead car, Samuel caught the reflection of the black sedan trailing them in his rearview mirror. His trained eyes missed nothing.
His brow furrowed. “We have a tail. Prepare to engage if necessary,” he instructed, his voice clipped and professional.
The bodyguard shifted in his seat, eyes narrowing at the reflection in the mirror. After a moment of deliberation, he turned to Samuel. “Mr. Ford,” he said gravely, “I recognize that vehicle—it’s Mr. Noel’s.”
Samuel’s composed facade cracked momentarily at this revelation. He scrutinized the license plate in the mirror again, confirming his suspicions. It was unmistakably Patrick’s vehicle—no room for doubt.
Why would Patrick dispatch his people to shadow them? Had their operation been compromised?
Samuel’s mind churned through a labyrinth of alarming possibilities. Sadie’s instructions had been crystal clear—their passenger’s identity must remain shrouded in absolute secrecy.
Their mission demanded impenetrable security at all costs. Deviation from these orders was simply not an option.
?tst chptrs in glnoνels.
After a weighted pause, Samuel broke the tension, his voice measured and deliberate. “If confrontation becomes inevitable, act decisively but remember—Mr. Noel’s people are not to be harmed,” he commanded.
The alliance between Wall Group and Burgess Group remained too valuable; a fallout would serve neither party’s interests. If Patrick’s people were merely probing out of curiosity, a warning would suffice to send them scurrying away. Should they persist, however, more… persuasive measures might become necessary.
“Understood, sir,” came the terse reply.
The procession of vehicles descended into the cavernous underground parking garage, headlights cutting through the dimness.
The moment the vehicles halted, the second car’s doors burst open, disgorging several black-suited bodyguards who materialized like shadows in motion. They fanned out with military precision, creating a protective semicircle, their vigilant gazes sweeping the area for potential threats. Samuel emerged from his vehicle with purposeful efficiency and strode directly to the second car, shoulders squared.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1026:
He swung open the rear door with a deferential gesture, revealing an elderly woman in modest attire who carefully stepped out.
From his vantage point nearby, Jack observed the tableau unfold with bated breath. Who was this unassuming elderly woman? Her advanced age and simple dress contradicted every expectation of Sadie’s typical high-powered business associates. Could this be some long-lost relative of Sadie’s? But why orchestrate such elaborate security measures to transport an old woman?
Questions multiplied in Jack’s mind like cells dividing, each spawning more uncertainties.
As Samuel ushered the woman briskly toward the elevator, Jack calculated his window of opportunity to trail them undetected. Suddenly, the whisper of approaching footsteps shattered his concentration.
Jack whirled around to find his vehicle encircled by stone-faced bodyguards, their presence materializing as if from thin air. His cover had been blown!
Terror seized Jack’s heart, causing it to stutter painfully in his chest. The bodyguards moved with the coordinated swiftness of striking vipers. One hulking figure wrenched open the car door and simultaneously clamped a vise-like hand over Jack’s mouth, silencing any potential outcry.
Before a sound could escape his throat, Jack found himself violently extracted from the driver’s seat, his body helpless against the bodyguards’ professional efficiency.
Across town at the hospital, Sadie perched on the edge of her bed, her distant gaze fixed on the world beyond the window.
A slight twitch disturbed her otherwise smooth brow as an inexplicable sense of foreboding crept up her spine. As if summoned by her intuition, her phone trilled to life the very next moment. Samuel’s name illuminated the screen.
She swiped to answer, bringing the device to her ear with practiced composure. “Hello,” she greeted, her voice betraying nothing.
Stories live now on g?lnσνs.cοm
Samuel’s deferential tone filtered through the connection, crisp and formal. “Ms. Hudson, I’ve secured our guest at Rosehill Apartments as instructed.” He paused, uncertainty coloring his normally confident tone. “However, we’ve encountered an… unexpected complication.”
Sadie had anticipated that smooth execution was too much to hope for in this delicate operation.
“Elaborate,” she commanded, steel underlying her calm.
Samuel drew a breath before delivering his report with professional precision. “We found Mr. Noel’s assistant, Jack, shadowing our convoy. His surveillance was unmistakable. We’ve detained him for now.” He paused before carefully adding, “Your orders regarding him, Ms. Hudson?”
Why would Noah dispatch Jack to trail Samuel’s movements? What game was Noah playing now?noveldrama
Sadie’s mind still grappled with these questions when the hospital room door swung open. Noah himself stood in the doorway, his features schooled into an unreadable mask.

###Chapter 1027:
Sadie’s brow furrowed as she quickly issued her command into the phone, eyes locked on Noah’s impassive face. “Contain him securely. Prevent any escape attempt, but ensure he remains unharmed.”
Once she ended the call, Sadie lifted her head and locked eyes with Noah, who had just stepped into the room. Her stare was sharp enough to freeze him mid-step.
A cold smirk played on her lips, untouched by warmth.
“So tell me, Mr. Noel,” she said, her voice low and edged with frost, “what exactly are you trying to achieve by having someone trail my people?”
Noah, holding a lunchbox in both hands, looked genuinely concerned. He placed the lunchbox down on the table beside her bed and gently lifted the lid. The rich scent of freshly made soup spread through the room.
“Sadie, are you sure you haven’t misunderstood something?” he asked, his expression filled with wide-eyed innocence. “I don’t recall doing anything like that.”
Without a word, Sadie placed her phone on the table and fixed him with a steely gaze. She didn’t have the patience for evasions.
“Jack has already been detained by my people,” she said, her tone as dry as sand. “So Mr. Noel, let’s stop pretending.”
Noah’s hand paused above the lunchbox. His boyish facade cracked for a moment, replaced by something sharper—a hint of amusement flickered in his eyes.
“Your people don’t waste time,” he said, nodding slowly. “I’ll admit, you caught me off guard.”
He pulled the lid off completely, letting the soup’s fragrance swirl freely through the air.
“Still, Jack disappointed me, getting caught so easily,” he added, letting out a light laugh. “Maybe I should gift-wrap him and send him over? If you’re running short on staff, you can have him.”

Sadie’s frown deepened. She had no interest in his games and even less patience for his attitude.
“Cut it out,” she said sharply. Her voice dropped, gaining an edge. “I don’t care what game you’re playing. But if your people keep sniffing around where they don’t belong…” She paused, her eyes locking onto his with an icy glare. “Don’t expect me to stay quiet.”
Noah blinked, just once. For a fleeting second, her words cut deeper than expected. Was she seriously ready to turn against him for whoever was holed up in that apartment?
No trace of emotion cracked through his calm. His smile stayed fixed, as if her words hadn’t even touched him.
Instead of answering, he stayed focused, scooping a spoonful of soup and gently blowing on it before holding it out toward her.
The gesture caught Sadie completely off guard. This was a moment for hard truths, not gentle kindness. She was laying down a warning, and here he was… feeding her?

###Chapter 1028:
A flicker of amusement crossed Noah’s face when he noticed her stunned expression.
“You haven’t eaten properly since last night,” he said, his voice much softer now. “The doctor told me you need rest and actual food in your system. Just try a little, alright?”
Noah’s concern was not fake. Sadie could see that much. And honestly, her stomach had been aching for something warm.
After a brief pause, she leaned forward slightly and let him feed her the soup. The heat of it was comforting. Smooth and mild, it settled into her belly like a quiet balm.
She swallowed slowly, then grabbed a tissue and dabbed at the corner of her mouth.
“I’m not hungry,” she muttered, her tone cold and distant. As if the woman who had just taken a spoonful had not been her at all. Her eyes drifted to the window. The first hints of morning were creeping into the sky.
“I’ll be discharged once the sun’s up.”
Was she racing back to that secret lover in Rosehill Apartments? Noah’s hand froze midway, the spoon still in his grip. A flash of something dark passed over his face as frustration rose like a tide.
“No,” he said, his voice dropping into something low and firm. “You’re not ready. Your fever might’ve gone down, but you’re still not well enough to leave.”
Sadie slowly turned to face him, stunned that he had actually denied her that.
“That sounds like a personal problem, Mr. Noel,” said Sadie, her voice laced with cool detachment. “You should focus on your own household. Your wife is pregnant. Shouldn’t your energy be spent on taking care of her?”
Her words acted like a spark, immediately setting fire to the emotions Noah had been holding back for so long. He lifted his head, eyes narrowing with sudden intensity.
“Hailey doesn’t mean anything to me,” he said, his tone low but deliberate.
gaν.kn – ?  
The seriousness in his voice caught Sadie off guard. Hailey didn’t mean anything to him? What was that supposed to mean?
Before Sadie could think further, Noah quietly lifted another spoonful of soup, holding it out like nothing had changed. But Sadie had already withdrawn. Whatever appetite she had vanished in an instant. She lay back down, tugged the blanket over her shoulders, and turned her back on Noah.
There was no need for words. Her silence screamed rejection. For a long second, Noah just stared at her still form. The spoon stayed in his hand, suspended between action and regret.
Eventually, he let out a slow sigh and brought the spoon to his own lips. The flavor was decent. Mild. Comforting, even.
After setting the lid back on the lunchbox, he placed it quietly on the bedside table.
“Have a good rest,” he murmured, though he knew she would not answer.
Noah’s voice had turned deep, with a tinge of begrudging assent that even he failed to notice. He stood up and cast a long, meaningful glance at Sadie’s back before turning away and leaving the room. The door shut behind him with a soft click.

###Chapter 1029:
Only then did Sadie allow herself to relax. She slowly sat up, a mix of emotions crossing her face. Had he really left, just like that? An irrational sense of loss welled up inside her chest, as if some part of her, deep down, had expected him to stay.
But then her lips curled into a self-deprecating smile. “What are you thinking, Sadie?” she softly mocked herself. “Did you really expect him to stay? Don’t be silly. He is Hailey’s husband now. He isn’t yours anymore.”
She was still wading through her jumbled thoughts when the knob turned again, and the door swung open.
Noah had returned.
Sadie was startled, but she quickly adopted her previously aloof demeanor. Noah was just as surprised to see her in a sitting position. Then he noticed her feigned composure, and a hint of amusement flickered in his eyes.
He walked to the bed and leaned close enough that his breath brushed against the shell of her ear.
“Well,” he drawled playfully, “were you sad to see me leave?”
Sadie’s heart skipped a beat. She could feel her cheeks heating up at his proximity.
Instead of answering him, she huffed and pulled the blanket over herself. In the dark cocoon of the covers, all she could hear was the furious pounding of her heart.
Noah’s declaration from earlier kept echoing in her head. He had told her that Hailey didn’t mean anything to him, but what did he mean? Was there trouble in their relationship? Had he regained his memory?
As soon as that last thought occurred to her, Sadie dismissed it. Impossible. If Noah’s memory had returned, he wouldn’t be treating her this way. He should be itching to kill her on sight.noveldrama
As Sadie’s mind continued to swirl in turmoil, she felt the mattress dip beside her. The bed immediately felt cramped. On instinct, she peeked over the blanket to see what was going on. It was all she could do not to gasp out loud.
   ? ν?
Noah had somehow climbed onto the bed! He was lying next to her, eliminating any semblance of distance between them. The warmth of his body radiated through the blanket, along with his heady, lavender scent. The air inside the room seemed to have grown thick and heavy. Sadie’s heart was hammering so fast, she wouldn’t be surprised if it beat right out of her chest.
She held her breath, not daring to move even a single inch. Sensing her tension, Noah reached out and gently brushed aside the stray strands of hair that framed the top of her face. Then Sadie felt a tender kiss on her forehead, so light and careful, it was like the brush of a feather against skin.
“Be good,” Noah’s voice was barely above a whisper, but it still carried a gentle kind of authority. “Get some sleep.”
Sadie pushed the blanket down so that her entire face was now exposed. And she gazed at his handsome face. Noah’s eyes were closed, his expression serene.
She had yearned for this face for three agonizing years. It had appeared countless times in her dreams, but each visit had only left her feeling empty upon waking.

###Chapter 1030:
Now, Noah lay beside her, his achingly familiar face close enough for her to caress. The feelings that Sadie had suppressed for so long came bubbling up to the surface—hurt, bitter anger, resentment… the longing that she refused to acknowledge.
In the end, she simply sighed to herself and closed her eyes as well.
Her body gradually relaxed, and she drifted off to sleep.
The next morning, the door of the hospital room burst open. Tina rushed inside with several bags containing breakfast. “Sadie! I bought your favorite fried egg sandwiches!”
She stopped in her tracks halfway across the room, her smile freezing on her face. Her eyes grew wide as saucers as she stared at the two people sleeping on the bed, her mind struggling to process what she was seeing.
Tina dropped the bags and spun around, her hands flying up to cover her eyes.
“Ah! I didn’t see anything! I didn’t see anything!” she yelled frantically. “I’ve gone blind!”
The small ruckus woke Sadie up. She groggily opened her eyes, and the first thing she saw was Noah’s handsome face, just a few inches from hers.
She tried to pull away, only to realize that she was nestled in his arms. Her face flushed red as memories of the previous night came rushing back to her.
Without a second thought, she shoved Noah away with all the strength she could muster.
He was still fast asleep and therefore unguarded. He rolled away easily, ultimately falling off the edge of the bed.
Noah hit the floor with a solid thud. He was wide awake in an instant. He sat up awkwardly, rubbing his arm as he stared at the culprit still lying comfortably on the bed.
His eyes were filled with accusation and no small amount of grievance. Was Sadie just tossing him aside as she pleased now?
 ? ? → g?ν
Sadie felt a pang of guilt under his gaze, but it was quickly chased away by a mix of embarrassment and annoyance. She cleared her throat and tried to appear unaffected.
Before she could speak, however, Noah beat her to the punch.
“Discarding me first thing the next morning, huh?” he asked in that irritatingly teasing tone again. He pulled himself up and dusted off the imaginary dirt from his clothes. Then he braced both hands on the bed and leaned close. “Aren’t you going to take responsibility for me?”
Tina, who still had her back to the bed, trembled at the words. Her fingers spread out on instinct, her eyes darting back and forth as she resisted the urge to peek at the two. What did she just hear? Responsibility?
Had something happened between Sadie and Patrick last night?
Good God, what explosive news!noveldrama
But when she really thought about it, Sadie and Patrick did make a good match—both were attractive and accomplished. They complemented each other really well.

###Chapter 1031:
Patrick was certainly much better than that spoiled playboy, Nathan. Meanwhile, Sadie almost passed out in anger at Noah’s audacity. She glared at him, silently telling him to shut his big mouth. This jerk, what kind of nonsense was he spouting, anyway?
Taking a deep breath, Sadie forced a smile and called out to Tina. “Please don’t misunderstand, Tina. We…”
She trailed off, belatedly realizing that no amount of explaining would make the situation any less suspicious.
Tina waited for a few beats before cautiously turning around. She looked back and forth between Sadie and Noah, barely able to keep her expression neutral.
“No misunderstanding! No misunderstanding at all! I didn’t see anything. I didn’t hear anything! I swear!”
And yet, the gleam in her eyes and the shadow of a knowing smile told Sadie that she had, in fact, gravely misunderstood everything.
Sadie sighed helplessly and massaged her temples. At this rate, more excuses would only make matters worse. So instead, she chose to change the subject entirely.
“You may leave the breakfast, Tina. Please go and arrange for my discharge papers. We need to head to Rosehill Apartments later.”
Noah’s eyes narrowed at the mention of Rosehill Apartments. Tina, on the other hand, promptly grabbed the bags she had dropped and set them down on the bedside table.noveldrama
“Alright, I’ll go get everything settled.”
Then she dashed out of the room as though she were fleeing the devil himself. Tina knew that if she stayed a moment longer, she wouldn’t be able to contain her curiosity. She was simply taking precautions.
Sadie let out another sigh, this one of relief. She had finally managed to send the little gossip enthusiast away.
M  ? glov?ls.0
She lifted the covers and made to leave the bed, but a large hand came down on her shoulder and pressed her back against the pillows. She had no idea when Noah had moved, but he was somehow looming over her now.
Noah knew Sadie decided to go to Rosehill Apartments just to rendezvous with the mysterious figure from yesterday’s phone call—the one who no one should find out about. The thought of her venturing there twisted something in his gut. Impossible.
“Count me in on this visit,” Noah’s voice rumbled deep from his chest, carrying an undeniable weight of authority.
Sadie froze mid-motion, tilting her chin to meet his gaze with unmistakable exasperation flickering across her features. Why did he always insist on meddling in her affairs? The question burned in her mind.
She furrowed her brow, her lips tightening into a thin line. “Mr. Noel, this is my personal matter,” she stated, each word dripping with displeasure.
Noah arched an eyebrow, his expression radiating justified confidence. “My assistant was held by your subordinates for a whole night, Ms. Hudson.” He enunciated each word slowly, his tone growing increasingly sharp like the edge of a blade. “Shouldn’t I go and check on him?”
.
.

###Chapter 1032:
Sadie’s retort died on her lips, leaving her momentarily speechless. Jack was indeed still with Samuel, a fact she couldn’t deny.
The detail had completely slipped from her mind like water through fingers.
When had Noah developed such razor-sharp articulation? It caught her off guard.
Try as she might, not a single valid ion materialized in her racing thoughts.
In the end, Sadie surrendered to the inevitable and acquiesced to his unwanted company.
She pressed her lips together in resignation, averting her gaze, and strode purposefully toward the bathroom.
As he watched her retreat with stiff shoulders betraying her annoyance, Noah’s lips curled into a smile of pure triumph.
Rosehill Apartments? The name echoed with intrigue.
Curiosity ignited within him about what tantalizing secrets she guarded behind those apartment walls.
Outside the door of a unit at Rosehill Apartments, Samuel was already posted, his tall frame emanating respectful vigilance. Sadie approached first, wasting no time with pleasantries.
“What’s the situation inside?” she demanded.
Samuel’s gaze instinctively darted to Noah standing beside Sadie, unmistakable surprise flashing across his normally composed face. Sadie had brought Patrick along? The unexpected development surprised him.
Samuel floundered, uncertainty washing over him. His forehead creased with a slight frown, words catching in his throat as he hesitated.
Dive into tales at gα? ησ ν s, com
Sadie cast a sidelong glance at Noah, who observed the unfolding scene with leisurely interest, as if enjoying a particularly entertaining show.
The reason for Samuel’s hesitation crystallized clearly in her mind. She shifted her attention back to Samuel, her voice dropping to a calm, detached register.
“Just say it. It’s alright.”
Taking a steadying breath, Samuel cast aside his hesitation. He extracted a thin file from his briefcase and presented it with both hands in a gesture of respect.
“Ms. Hudson, this compiles all the information I’ve gathered on Sharon Buckley thus far.”
Sadie reached out and grasped the file, letting it rest between her slender fingers without immediately opening it. She simply lifted her penetrating gaze back to Samuel’s face.
“Take Mr. Noel to retrieve Jack, then escort them both away from the premises.”noveldrama
Her tone remained clinically detached, the words flowing as casually as if she were ordering morning coffee.
Having delivered her instructions, she deliberately ignored Noah’s presence beside her and pivoted to press the doorbell.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1033:
Noah bristled at the dismissal, determination hardening within him. He wouldn’t let her slip away so easily.
He took one fluid, calculated stride, placing his body directly in her path, a playful smile dancing at the corners of his mouth.
“Ms. Hudson, I’ve traveled all this way with you, and you’re already trying to dismiss me without even offering a moment’s… hospitality?”
Sadie’s finger froze a hairsbreadth from the doorbell. She pivoted slowly to face Noah, observing his self-assured expression. A sudden laugh, tinged with unmistakable mockery, escaped her lips. Wasn’t he the one who had adamantly insisted on accompanying her just moments ago? The irony wasn’t lost on her.
A sharp retort formed on her tongue, but before she could unleash it, Noah moved with unexpected swiftness, as if he’d anticipated her very thoughts. In one deft motion, he sidestepped her body, shoved open the unlocked apartment door, and glided inside like a shadow.noveldrama
His movements flowed with such fluid precision and blinding speed that neither Sadie nor Samuel could possibly intervene. Sadie stood rooted to the spot, utterly speechless. The arsenal of sarcastic remarks she had mentally prepared evaporated instantly, leaving nothing but stunned silence trapped in her throat. Noah’s shamelessness reached new, impressive heights with each encounter.
From his position to the side, Samuel lowered his head strategically, shrinking his presence and barely permitting himself to breathe. With tension crackling between Sadie and Patrick like live electricity, Samuel wisely opted to maintain invisibility.
Sadie inhaled deeply, drawing air to the bottom of her lungs, forcibly tamping down the volcano of exasperation threatening to erupt. Composing herself, she squared her shoulders and marched purposefully after him into the apartment. Samuel trailed after her like a shadow, pulling the apartment door closed with barely a whisper of sound.
Sunlight spilled across the spacious living room, illuminating its simple yet invitingly cozy decor. The hunched figure perched anxiously on the edge of the sofa, however, cast a palpable shadow of unease across the otherwise warm atmosphere.
Lаt?st chαpt?rs in g?lnov?ls.?οm
It was a woman in her fifties, clad in modest attire, silver threads woven through her hair. Her fingers twisted the hem of her garment with white-knuckled intensity, her slight frame visibly trembling, and her face etched with naked fear and raw anxiety.
Noah’s keen gaze immediately locked onto the distressed woman perched on the sofa. His stride faltered momentarily, a subtle furrow forming between his brows. A woman? This unexpected revelation deepened the mystery.
A middle-aged woman?
Could this really be the same person Sadie had gone to such lengths to conceal at Rosehill Apartments—the one she secretly brought into Jazmah, with so many people involved, all while keeping it a secret? This didn’t match anything Noah had expected. The suspicion that had been weighing on him dissolved, leaving only a strange, disoriented confusion.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1034:
He shot a glance at Sadie, his brow knitted tightly, his voice low. “Who’s she?”
But Sadie didn’t answer. Her gaze never wavered from the woman sitting silently on the sofa.
Without saying a word, she stepped forward and came to a quiet stop right in front of the woman.
When she finally spoke, her voice was low and calm, threaded with something tender. “Hi, Sharon.”
The trembling woman, who had been bowing her head, suddenly flinched as if struck by lightning. Her head, once bowed, began to rise—slowly, as if she couldn’t believe what she just heard.
And then her eyes, cloudy with age and shock, locked onto Sadie’s face. For a moment, she was speechless. Her mouth opened, but no sound came. Just a raspy breath caught between disbelief and emotion. Then, all at once, tears silently spilled down her cheeks. She pushed herself up from the sofa so quickly that she nearly lost balance. Clutching Sadie’s arm with surprising force, she cried out through her sobs, “Mrs. Hudson! Mrs. Hudson! It’s really you! You’re alive! You came back!”
That title “Mrs. Hudson,” and the raw emotion behind it made Sadie freeze in place.
The next second, realization struck her. Sharon had mistaken her for Brenda Hudson, her mother.
The resemblance was undeniable. Given how much time had passed, it wasn’t surprising that Sharon would mix them up in a moment like this.
Sadie’s eyes lingered on Sharon’s tear-streaked face, her lips trembling, her body barely holding itself together. A pang of sorrow settled deep in Sadie’s chest.noveldrama
gα?ησν?s?com takes you on a journey
She drew in a slow breath, gently reached out to support Sharon, and whispered softly, “Sharon, take a careful look. I’m not Brenda. I’m her daughter—Sadie Hudson. Brenda and Dederick’s child.”
When Sharon heard those words, her sobs ceased abruptly, her breath catching in her throat.
She looked up, studying the young yet hauntingly familiar face before her.
The likeness was uncanny—those distinctive brows, penetrating eyes, and elegant bone structure—it was as though Mrs. Hudson herself had materialized before her.
Yet this face possessed a youthful glow, and those eyes harbored a quiet strength she’d never witnessed in Mrs. Hudson.
This wasn’t Mrs. Hudson. It was her daughter—flesh and blood of the woman she once knew.
Sharon gazed at Sadie, her vision blurring gradually as comprehension washed over her weathered features.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1035:
She released Sadie’s hand and collapsed against the sofa cushions, energy draining from her frame like water through fingers. She cast her eyes downward at her work-roughened hands, her voice carrying unmistakable traces of resignation and bitterness.
“Yeah… time hasn’t been kind. These eyes betray me constantly nowadays. I genuinely believed you were her standing before me,” she murmured softly, fresh tears gathering at the corners of her faded eyes, threatening to spill over.
“I never discovered Mrs. Hudson had brought a daughter into this world. That’s… that’s extraordinary. Truly remarkable.”
Sadie eased herself down beside Sharon and tenderly enveloped the older woman’s hand within her own.
“Sharon,” Sadie leaned forward earnestly, “I’ve dedicated more than a decade to looking for my parents. Can you tell me their whereabouts? Do you possess any knowledge of what befell them?”
Sharon patted Sadie’s hand delicately, her weathered face etched with profound compassion and unspoken understanding.
“Sadie, your parents vanished to ensure your protection. So many seasons have turned since then. Perhaps… the moment has arrived to release this burden.”
Sadie shook her head defiantly, her gaze unwavering and resolute asnoveldrama
“Absolutely not. I’ve devoted far too many precious years to this quest. Even as she drew her final breaths, my grandmother’s thoughts remained fixed on them. I swore a sacred oath to reunite with my parents.”
Nearby, comprehension dawned across Noah’s features like a sunrise. Everything Sadie had done—all had been driven by devotion to her parents. There wasn’t a man she was hiding.
   ? ?ν﹒
He studied Sadie’s determined countenance, and something fundamental transformed within the chambers of his heart.
He advanced a step, inclined his tall frame deliberately, and addressed Sharon with carefully measured gentleness.
“Ma’am, should any concerns trouble your mind, however slight, please share them freely. We stand prepared to offer assistance in whatever capacity necessary.”
Sharon tilted her head upward toward the man who had unexpectedly interjected. His presence commanded attention—possessing a rare refinement that distinguished him immediately.
He had maintained his vigilant position beside Sadie throughout their exchange, betraying a relationship clearly more intimate than casual acquaintance.
Sharon’s brow furrowed with undisguised curiosity.
“And you are?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1036:
Sadie parted her lips to formulate a response, but Noah intercepted swiftly.
“I’m Sadie’s husband,” he declared without hesitation.
Sadie whipped her head toward him, her eyes widening in astonishment. What preposterous claim had just escaped his lips?
Noah seized the opportunity, deftly encircling her shoulders with his arm, and offered a disarmingly tender smile.
“Ma’am, I eagerly anticipate the privilege of meeting Sadie’s parents—and properly securing their blessing for our union.”
Sadie’s muscles coiled tightly beneath his touch, her instincts screaming to thrust him away forcefully, yet she knew creating conflict before Sharon would undermine their purpose entirely.
This man’s audacity seemed to multiply exponentially with each passing sunrise!
Sharon examined the young pair intently, a brief spark of genuine warmth illuminating her otherwise troubled gaze.
The revelation that Mrs. Hudson’s offspring had already entered matrimony caught her entirely unprepared.noveldrama
Moreover, judging by unmistakable signs, Sadie’s husband appeared to harbor genuine devotion toward her.
If Mrs. Hudson could witness this development, her troubled spirit would undoubtedly find profound solace.
The deep-etched lines of concern across Sharon’s weathered face gradually smoothed, like ripples settling on disturbed water.
The tales you love are at g?lnσνs?c?m
“I shall reveal everything within my knowledge,” she announced finally, inhaling deeply. “But fortify yourselves accordingly. What follows may prove exceedingly difficult to process.”
Sadie and Noah exchanged a loaded glance. Something ominous in Sharon’s tone caused their stomachs to knot with visceral apprehension.
Sharon expelled a prolonged breath, her gaze growing distant as memories emerged from the fog of passing years.
“The events transpired five years ago. My son contracted a devastating illness, and treatment costs remained hopelessly beyond our financial reach. Death hovered at his bedside constantly. Then, during the New Year season, as though divine intervention had manifested, information regarding employment reached me. An establishment sought someone to provide care for a particular couple. The compensation offered exceeded all reasonable expectations—suspiciously generous, in retrospect. Naturally, I accepted immediately. This establishment carried the name Faron Retreat.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1037:
Sharon hesitated, her expression suggesting careful navigation through the labyrinth of bygone experiences.
“Your parents personally selected me for employment. Their kindness transcended ordinary human decency. Upon discovering my desperate circumstances, they provided a substantial advance payment without hesitation. Those funds literally rescued my child from death’s clutches. My gratitude manifested through unprecedented devotion to my responsibilities. Mrs. Hudson elevated me beyond mere employee status—she embraced me as a confidante. Our connection blossomed into genuine friendship.”
Sadie absorbed each word in contemplative silence, her head inclined slightly downward, fingers unconsciously tracing patterns on her knee. Faron Retreat. The name triggered immediate recognition—a prestigious establishment situated mere miles beyond Jazmah’s boundaries. What compelling motivation could possibly have driven her parents to seek refuge there?
She raised her gaze deliberately, eyes narrowing slightly. “Sharon, throughout your tenure at Faron Retreat, did you observe anything… outside normal patterns or expectations?”
Sharon’s forehead creased deeply, her gaze turning inward as she meticulously excavated memories from the recesses of her mind.
“Anything outside normal patterns or expectations? Throughout my eighteen-month employment period, your parents scarcely ventured beyond the property boundaries—virtually imprisoned by invisible constraints. Additionally, during every supply excursion into town, I encountered individuals loitering suspiciously around peripheral areas. These people bore no resemblance to typical tourists or staff members—merely vigilant observers maintaining a calculated distance, constantly watching.”
She paused meaningfully, leaning forward conspiratorially as her voice dropped to barely above a whisper.
Your story hub is g?lnσνs?
“Then arrived Labor Day that fateful year, when a masked individual appeared without warning. He proceeded directly to your parents’ quarters without deviation and remained for an extended duration. They dispatched me immediately with unusual urgency—explicitly instructed me to maintain significant distance from the premises.”
Sadie’s heart lurched violently against her ribcage, her breath catching painfully. A masked stranger intruding into her parents’ sanctuary?
“Approximately seven days following Labor Day…”
Panic washed over Sharon’s face, her voice shaking as she tried to speak. “I was fast asleep that night when Mrs. Hudson burst into my room out of nowhere. She looked like she had seen a ghost—her skin was pale, and she could not stop trembling. She told me to grab my things and get out of Faron Retreat immediately.” Her hands clenched as she recalled the past.

###Chapter 1038:
“She would not tell me why. Just kept saying I had to leave, to go far away and never come back. She told me not to ask questions, not to look back, and most of all… to protect myself. I was too scared to think. I didn’t understand, but I did what she said. I packed and left that same night.”
Tears pressed against Sharon’s eyes as her voice dropped. “But the next day… something didn’t sit right. The more I thought about it, the more uneasy I felt. That kind of fear doesn’t just come out of nowhere.” She paused, swallowing hard before continuing.
“I turned on the TV, hoping to calm myself down. But then I saw the news. They were reporting on a fire at Faron Retreat. Said it broke out the night before and burned the whole place to the ground. It was completely destroyed.” For a moment, she covered her mouth with both hands, trying to steady herself.
“The police found two bodies inside. A man and a woman. They were burned beyond recognition.”
At that, Sharon could not hold it in any longer. Tears streamed down her face as she broke into sobs. “I couldn’t believe it. It felt like my whole world collapsed right then.” She tried to gather herself between breaths.
“Later, the investigators confirmed the victims were Mr. and Mrs. Hudson. Called it an accident. Just a fire. Case closed.” Grief clouded her voice as she looked down. “I didn’t know if they had any relatives. I didn’t know who to reach out to. So I handled it myself. I collected their ashes. Buried them together at Evergreen Cemetery. Figured the least I could do was let them rest.”noveldrama
Her fingers tightened against her sleeves as she continued, “Eventually, I went back to Faron Retreat. I wanted to look for clues, to collect whatever was left behind. But the people who used to linger around there had vanished. Just like that.” Finally, Sharon met Sadie’s gaze, her own brimming with sorrow. “Sadie… I know this is hard to hear. But they’re gone. Really gone.”
Sadie didn’t respond right away. A sting burned behind her eyes, blurring the room around her.
g ? ln σ ν ?s?com, where stories thrive
Tears began to rise before she could stop them.
An accidental fire?
She couldn’t bring herself to accept that.
With all the strange things that had happened, how could this, of all things, be chalked up to chance?
The crowd that had gathered, the man in the mask, and her parents’ urgent final words all echoed in her mind.
None of it felt random. Every thread led to the same cruel conclusion.
They had not died by chance.
Still, at least she had a piece of closure now.
She had found the place where they had last been alive.
Rising to her feet with steady resolve, Sadie gave Sharon a deep, respectful bow. “Thank you, Sharon, for taking care of my parents back then.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1039:
Her gaze shifted to Samuel, calm but firm. “Make sure Sharon has everything she needs.”
Without missing a moment, Samuel nodded and bowed in response. With nothing more to say, Sadie turned and made her way to the apartment door.
Noah was not far behind. His steps quickened until he matched her pace.
He did not need to ask what she was feeling. The grief clung to her like a second skin. Evergreen Cemetery.
There was only one place she could be heading now.
“Are you planning to go to Evergreen Cemetery?” he asked quietly. “Let me take you.”
Sadie didn’t answer. Her footsteps didn’t falter. She didn’t even glance his way.
Both of them stepped into the elevator in silence, one right after the other.
As the doors slid shut, the air between them thickened. Neither spoke.
The hum of descent was the only sound.
Ding!
The elevator opened on the first floor.
Sadie was out before the doors had fully parted, heading straight for the parked car outside.
She reached for the handle, but before she could pull it open, a firm hand slammed down on it, stopping her in place.
Sadie shifted, casting a frosty glance over her shoulder at Noah. Meeting her bloodshot stare, Noah drew in a breath, concern etched across his face.
Charging to the cemetery without thinking—especially in her current state—would only spell disaster.noveldrama
g0ν. – Continue reading
“Don’t let your emotions drive you,” said Noah, keeping his voice low but firm. “There are too many things that don’t add up. The ones watching your parents. The man who showed up on Labor Day. And your parents… they were clearly unsettled before the fire happened. Whoever we’re up against is hiding in the shadows while we’re standing out in the open. We can’t afford to be reckless.”
At that, Sadie slowly closed her eyes, as if trying to suppress the storm building inside her.
She could not deny it. Those strange moments. All the loose threads. Her parents had not died from some simple accident. That much was obvious now.
Rushing into Evergreen Cemetery might provide an outlet for her emotions, but it also risked falling right into the enemy’s trap.
She needed to think—strategize, not react.
When Sadie’s eyes opened again, a cooler, sharper clarity had returned. She raised her head and met Noah’s gaze. “Then tell me. What would you do?”
Watching her gather herself again brought a small breath of relief to Noah’s chest.
At least she had not let her grief consume her completely.
“We have to go to Evergreen Cemetery eventually,” he said carefully. “But not yet.”
.

.
###Chapter 1040:
Sadie’s brow tightened, the shift in plan throwing her off.
Not yet? Then when?
What was he really getting at?
“What are you trying to say?” she asked, her voice cautious.
Several hours must have slipped by unnoticed. The sky had turned pitch black.
Near the entrance of Evergreen Cemetery, a sleek black Maybach eased to a stop by the curb, its engine humming quietly.
A soft click broke the silence as the door swung open and Sadie stepped out, the sharp tap of her heels breaking against the pavement. Rather than somber or understated, her look leaned towards high society—an elegant black cocktail dress hugged her frame, her hair perfectly styled, and a string of pearls rested delicately around her neck.
The ensemble could have turned heads at a gala, not at a place where the dead lay still.
Without a word, she reached out and looped her arm through Noah’s with a stiffness that suggested she still wasn’t sold on the plan. Dressed in a tailored black suit, Noah stood beside her, composed and formal, every bit the gentleman escort.
Together, they looked more like they were arriving at an exclusive after-party than visiting a gravesite.
Sadie tilted her head slightly and glanced up at him, her tone laced with irritation. “This is your big idea? Showing up dressed like this in the middle of the night? Who does that at a cemetery?”
There had to be a better way. Anything would have drawn less attention than this ridiculous display.
Leaning in slightly, Noah lowered his voice, calm and deliberate. “Keep your voice down. Just trust me and go along with it.”
?  ?ν.
Sadie held back a groan, her patience fraying. Whatever game he was playing, it had better be worth it.
From the gatehouse, a figure stirred. The cemetery attendant, drawn by the sound of voices, stepped out into the dim light.
His eyes narrowed as he caught sight of them.
There was no mistaking the elegance. The man was striking, the woman even more so. Their polished appearance hinted at wealth or influence—or both.
But something didn’t add up. What kind of couple turned up at a cemetery at this hour looking like that?
Despite his curiosity, the attendant kept his tone courteous as he approached. “Is there something I can help you with?”
Noah dropped Sadie’s arm and slipped into a more somber expression, his voice taking on a note of grief. “Yes. A family elder passed suddenly a few days ago. My wife and I wanted to look for a proper resting place for him… somewhere peaceful.”noveldrama
Sadie’s mouth twitched ever so slightly, her self-control barely holding back a scoff at his clumsy performance.

###Chapter 1041:
Hearing Noah’s somber excuse, the attendant gave a sympathetic nod. “Ah, I understand. My deepest condolences. Please, come in. I’ll explain our options. Our cemetery offers very competitive pricing, and the location…”
Before he could finish, Noah cut him off smoothly. “That won’t be necessary. We would prefer to walk the grounds ourselves. It’s an important decision—where to lay someone to rest. We would like to see it firsthand. If we find the right place, we’ll handle the payment and reservation tonight.”
Tonight?
Browsing burial plots under a moonlit sky?
The attendant blinked in confusion.
Nothing about this seemed normal.noveldrama
At night, the cemetery was shrouded in dim light, its eerie atmosphere thick with a sense of impending doom.
This man appeared perfectly ordinary, so why would he make such an odd request?
He studied Noah briefly. The man didn’t appear disturbed or unhinged, yet this request felt wildly out of place.
Still, money was money—and the customer came first.
Forcing a polite expression, the attendant gestured ahead. “Uh… of course. Right this way.”
Sadie’s eyes moved quickly, sweeping across the tombstones as they walked.
Somewhere among them… could her parents really be here?
Noticing the urgency in her steps, Noah reached out and gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.
Guiding them forward, the attendant began his rehearsed introduction, detailing the layout of the grounds with careful precision.
L?t?st chαpt?rs in glnovels.
“This way, please,” said the attendant, motioning ahead with practiced ease. “This area is one of our finest. It offers a sweeping view of the hills, and many prominent families choose to honor their loved ones here.”
Trailing behind, Sadie and Noah kept up the pace, though their nods and murmurs barely passed for genuine interest.
Their eyes kept shifting back and forth, moving from one tombstone to the next on either side.
Brenda Hudson. Dederick Hudson.
Those names clung to Sadie’s thoughts like shadows she couldn’t shake. She needed to find them. She had to.
When the attendant noticed their distant demeanor, his brow creased with mild suspicion.
It was strange enough to be giving a tour after dark. But now he wasn’t even sure they cared about any of the plots at all.
What was their real purpose here?
.
.
.
###Chapter 1042:
Gravestone after gravestone came and went. Most of the main grounds had already been covered, but Sadie and Noah were still empty-handed. Sadie’s steps began to slow. Confusion etched itself across her face as she glanced at Noah, silently asking what their next move should be.
Wandering like this was pointless.
The grounds stretched too far, and the faint lighting made the search almost impossible.
Beside her, Noah seemed to come to the same conclusion.
As if struck by a sudden thought, he spoke casually, eyes still scanning the tombstones. “Now that I think about it… I had a friend mention that one of his relatives was buried here. That must have been five years ago or so.”
That comment made the attendant halt and turn around, clearly intrigued.
“Five years?” he repeated, blinking in surprise.
A tight, uncertain smile tugged at his lips.
“I believe you’re mistaken, sir. Evergreen Cemetery was only established three years ago. Before that, this was just forested land. People around here called it Evergreen Mountain. When we developed it into a formal cemetery, any old graves scattered in the area were respectfully relocated to the back hill.”
Noah and Sadie shared a brief, silent glance between them.
So that explained it.
Letting go of Sadie’s hand, Noah reached into his jacket and pulled out a thick bundle of cash. Without a word, he stepped forward and pressed it into the attendant’s hand.
Caught off guard, the man stared at the money, fingers tightening instinctively around the stack.
?  ? ? → gν?
It had to be at least thirty thousand dollars, maybe more.
Raising his eyes in confusion, he found Noah still wearing the same carefully crafted expression of grief. “We would like some time to walk around on our own,” Noah said gently. “Just to absorb the atmosphere before we make a decision. Thank you for your assistance.”
For a moment, the attendant stood frozen.
What was happening?
He had given them a short tour, and now he was holding a small fortune? For him, that amount was equal to half a year’s salary, along with bonuses!
This man was remarkably generous in his kindness.
Still stunned, the attendant managed a clumsy smile. “Oh, you two are too kind! Really, it’s just part of my job. But of course, I’ll give you your space. If anything comes up, I’ll be back at the gatehouse.”
Without wasting another second, he clutched the money and hurried off, moving as though they might change their minds if he lingered too long.
As soon as he was out of sight, Sadie turned and picked up her pace, heading quickly toward the back hill the attendant had pointed out earlier.noveldrama

###Chapter 1043:
Sadie and Noah made a beeline for the back hill the attendant had indicated earlier.
The back hill sprawled before them—a neglected corner of the cemetery that stood in harsh opposition to the meticulously groomed main grounds.
No orderly rows of tombstones greeted them—only haphazard mounds of earth surrendered to decay. Weeds had claimed dominion here, and abandonment hung thick in the air.
With each footfall, Sadie’s heart seemed to plunge deeper into an emotional quicksand, pulling her down with inexorable force.
Seventeen years had elapsed—seventeen years of aching for her parents through countless days and sleepless nights. Could this desolate wasteland truly be their final resting place?
Noah studied her rigid silhouette, a leaden weight descending upon his chest as he witnessed her silent struggle.
Her pain radiated outward, palpable in the desperation that propelled each of her movements.
Together they forged through the tall grass, methodically examining every weathered headstone for a familiar inscription.
In places, the wild grass stretched nearly to their shoulders, and certain areas were devoid of any semblance of a path. They muscled their way through the dense, intertwined vegetation.
As night deepened, their search intensified in difficulty. The moon cast merely a feeble luminescence, scarcely illuminating their path. Sadie’s apprehension mounted with every ticking moment, coiling tighter around her chest.
Her breath grew shallow and rapid, her gaze darting frantically across each patch of earth where a marker might lie concealed.
’  ?: ν
Noah extracted his phone and activated its flashlight, the sharp beam slicing through the oppressive darkness like a luminous blade. He meticulously swept the beam across every mound and eroded stone, revealing forgotten names one by one.
They ventured forward, penetrating deeper into the heart of the forgotten hill.
Minutes stretched into an indeterminate blur as perspiration beaded on Sadie’s brow—whether from physical strain or mounting dread, she couldn’t discern.
Then, obscured behind an unruly thicket of weeds, her eyes latched onto a humble stone marker.
The marker was diminutive, partially submerged in earth, and draped in a velvet cloak of moss.
Had Noah’s light not struck it at precisely the right angle, the stone would have remained invisible to their searching eyes.
Faded characters etched into the surface whispered names from another time.
Sadie delicately pushed the tangled growth aside, her motions deliberate and reverent, as though handling something hallowed and irreplaceable.

###Chapter 1044:
“Brenda Hudson… Dederick Hudson…” Sadie murmured, her voice quavering as the cherished names tumbled from her lips into the night.
These precious names had echoed in the chambers of her heart for years, an unending mantra she had refused to relinquish.noveldrama
Tears pooled in her eyes before cascading down her cheeks like shattered pearls, dampening the parched grass below.
After seventeen agonizing years of searching, she had at last found them—her beloved parents, interred in this forsaken hill, denied even the dignity of a proper memorial stone.
Her knees buckled beneath the weight of emotion, and she crumpled to the ground, extending quivering hands toward the marker.
Her fingertips brushed against the frigid stone, desperately seeking some lingering echo of their warmth beneath its unforgiving surface.
“Dad… Mom…” she managed through a throat constricted with grief, her words fracturing under the weight of unrestrained sobs.
Every fragment of sorrow and yearning she had entombed within her soul erupted in that singular, shattering moment.
“I’ve found you finally,” she whispered, the simple declaration carrying the weight of a thousand sleepless nights.
“I’ll bring you home… Please, if you’re watching from beyond, guide me to the one who murdered you,” she pleaded, her words drifting upward into the vast night sky.
Her whispers caressed the stone as her tear-stained features slowly transformed, crystallizing into a mask of unwavering determination. Sadie rose to her feet, drawing in a profound, fortifying breath that filled her lungs with purpose.
The anguish remained undiminished—but now it smoldered with newfound resolve, fueling her instead of consuming her.
gα ? ησ ν s?com has it all
She brushed away her tears with the back of her hand and turned her attention to the task before her.
Her eyes detected an anomaly beneath the marker—an irregular slab, evidently a later addition, that failed to align properly with the encircling soil.
She attempted to hoist it upward, summoning every ounce of her strength, but the stubborn slab refused to yield.
Noah moved forward, his voice calm and reassuring. “Let me handle this.”
He lowered himself beside her, secured his fingers around the slab’s rough edge, and heaved upward, his muscles corded with exertion. United in their effort, they succeeded in dislodging the heavy stone and shoving it away.
Beneath lay a humble, unassuming grave. Within rested two austere clay urns, positioned side by side—unembellished, modest, yet profoundly eloquent in their silence.
Sadie knelt and gathered the urns with the tender reverence one reserved for handling irreplaceable relics.
She clutched them against her heart, acutely aware of their physical heft and immeasurable emotional significance.
.

###Chapter 1045:
Here cradled in her arms was her lineage—her parents. Flesh of her flesh, blood flowing from their blood, the very source of her existence. With her precious burden still embraced against her chest, she gradually ascended to a standing position.
Noah observed her transformation, his unwavering gaze communicating a depth of solidarity that transcended the need for speech.
They pivoted and commenced their departure from the desolate hill, leaving behind only disturbed earth and unanswered questions. Their arrival had been marked by urgency, but their exit bore the gravity of recovered memories that anchored each deliberate footfall.
They navigated back through the towering grass toward the manicured expanse of the primary cemetery grounds, two silhouettes merging with the darkness.noveldrama
The attendant remained stationed at the gate, his patient vigilance rewarded by their reappearance.
Upon glimpsing their approach—and the s clutched in Sadie’s possession—he stiffened, rooted to the spot.
His eyes dilated with recognition when the moonlight revealed the s—two urns nestled protectively in Sadie’s embrace.
Curiosity visibly washed over his features, but the grave intensity emanating from the couple’s expressions silenced any impending inquiry.
These visitors hardly resembled customers seeking to purchase a burial plot. Instead, they bore the unmistakable aspect of those reclaiming what was lost—yet the back hill housed nothing but abandoned, forgotten graves.
Noah advanced, deliberately placing his body as a shield between Sadie’s vulnerable form and the attendant’s probing gaze.
Wordlessly, he extracted another substantial bundle of bills from his pocket and extended it toward the man.
Lаττ ch?ρτ?rs ιn glov?ls.
The attendant’s hand reached out reflexively, fingers registering the substantial heft of the unexpected payment.
He lifted his gaze questioningly, only to encounter Noah’s unflinching stare—a wall of resolute silence.
No further explanation was necessary.
The night’s mysterious proceedings transcended the attendant’s comprehension, drifting into realms he dared not contemplate. These enigmatic visitors, shrouded in purpose and grief, had compensated him generously for his discretion.
Certain matters, his instincts warned, warranted deliberate blindness—best left unseen, unheard, and buried in silence.
Safeguarding this surprising fortune superseded any fleeting satisfaction curiosity might provide.
He bobbed his head in hurried acknowledgment, then plastered an expansive, eager grin across his face—complicity sealed in the exchange.
“I didn’t see anything, and I don’t know anything. My lips are sealed,” said the attendant, sounding sure of himself. Noah gave a short nod.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1046:
Sadie and Noah passed the attendant without a word. They headed straight for the luxury sedan waiting by the curb.
Sadie climbed in first, stepping carefully in her high heels.
She rested the urns gently on her lap.
Noah got in after her.
Sadie spoke to the driver, her voice a little rough. “Pearlhall Apartments, please.”
The driver gave a small nod.
The car eased forward, pulling away from Evergreen Cemetery. Inside the car, the only sound was the quiet hum of the engine as they left the cemetery behind.
Sadie held the urns close and stared out the window, her gaze far away. The darkness outside seemed to echo the sadness in her eyes. Seventeen years of searching had finally ended, but the answer left her feeling empty.
Her parents’ ashes felt too light on her lap, like a breeze could carry them off.
She wanted to hug them tighter, but she was afraid she might lose the fragile connection she had left.
She knew grief wouldn’t bring her answers. She had to stay steady. She had to uncover the truth—for them, and for herself.
Noah sat beside her, watching quietly. He could feel the weight of her sorrow.
Sadie—always the strong one—now let her guard down, showing a part of herself few ever saw.
Noah wished he could reach out and comfort her. But he wasn’t sure how. She didn’t need empty words. She needed something real; something solid.
And he would give her that. Whatever she needed, whatever path she chose, he would stand beside her. He would protect her. He would help her.
 ?  → g?ν?
It was a promise he made to himself; a quiet vow he couldn’t break.
Half an hour later, the car rolled into an old neighborhood. This was Pearlhall Apartments, where Laura once lived.
Noah glanced out the window, taking in the sight of aging buildings, chipped walls, and wild plants creeping along the fences.
Something about the place tugged at him, a strange flicker of déjà vu that left him uneasy.noveldrama
Had he been here before? When? Why?
But the answers felt distant, buried under years he couldn’t quite reach. Before he could say anything, Sadie had already stepped out of the car, the urns still in her arms. He followed silently. They entered the building.
The hallway was dim, filled with the stale smell of old wood and dust. Every step on the stairs felt heavy, as though they were walking through old memories.
Sadie moved forward, holding the urns close, her pace steady.
This was where she had grown up with her grandmother.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1047:
So many of her memories belonged here.
Bringing her parents’ ashes back felt like closing a circle.
She wasn’t sure what would come next. But for now, this was where they belonged.
When they reached the fifth floor, she stopped at Apartment 501. She drew a deep breath and reached for her key. But the door was already slightly open.
A wave of unease rushed through her. She was sure she had locked it before she left the last time. Who had been here?
A flicker of doubt crossed her mind. How could the door be open?
She pushed the door and walked inside.
Noah followed close behind.
The soft glow of a yellow lamp filled the room.
A figure stood in the living room, facing the wall, studying an old painting.
It was Alex. He turned around at the sound.
When he saw Sadie, surprise flashed in his eyes. Then a warm smile took its place.
“Sadie?” His voice carried an open joy. “You’re back.” His gaze softened, gentle like early spring sunlight.
But then his eyes landed on the two small urns in her arms, and his smile faded a little.noveldrama
“I came to see Laura,” he said, his tone honest. “I thought she might feel lonely here, so I wanted to sit with her for a while.” Sadie had returned. And she was holding… what was that?
Alex’s eyes moved from the urns to Noah standing behind her.

The man was tall, dressed in a black suit that matched Sadie’s outfit. His face was mostly hidden by a mask.
But even with the mask, the familiar shape, the steady presence—Alex knew exactly who it was.
His smile disappeared; a hard look settled on his face. His brows pulled tight.
Why was this man here? Why now, in a place that meant so much to Sadie?
Without thinking, Alex stepped forward. He grabbed Sadie’s arm and pulled her close.
Noah’s gaze darkened. A cold glint flashed in his eyes. He stared at Alex’s hand gripping Sadie, his irritation growing.
Alex always showed up where he wasn’t wanted.
Alex ignored the thick tension between them. He held Noah’s gaze with quiet determination.
“Mr. Noel,” Alex said, stressing the name, leaving no warmth in his words. “This is Sadie’s home. Our home. You’re not welcome here. Please leave.”
Noah stayed silent. He didn’t even look at Alex.
His eyes swept calmly across the apartment, taking in the worn but welcoming furniture.

###Chapter 1048:
Everything felt old, yet cared for. This was a place that had been lived in, a place that had been loved.
At last, his gaze stopped at a cabinet against the living room wall.
On top stood a simple altar.
In front of the altar sat a black-and-white photo of an elderly woman with kind eyes and a gentle smile.
It was Laura.
Noah’s eyes lingered on the picture.
He remembered her. She was Sadie’s grandmother. He had met her three years ago.
Sadie, unaware of the quiet tension between the two men, kept her attention on the urns in her arms and the altar before her.
She gently slipped her arm free from Alex’s grip and walked toward the altar.
Standing there, she moved slowly and carefully. With both hands, she placed the urns beside her grandmother’s photo.
Then she lifted her gaze to the familiar face in the frame. The tears she had been holding back finally fell, blurring her sight.
“Grandma…” Her voice cracked, thick with emotion. “I brought Mom and Dad home.”
Each word came out soft, uneven, as if speaking them drained her. “They missed you… so much.”
The room stayed still, except for her quiet sobs. The weight of seventeen years pressed down, heavy with loss and reunion.
Alex stepped back, watching her tremble, his chest tightening with sadness.
gαlnσν?ls?com has fresh updates for you
Now he understood. The urns— they were her parents. This was why she had come back here tonight.
He wanted to comfort her, but nothing he could say felt right. No gesture seemed enough.
Noah stood still. His face stayed hidden behind the mask.
His gaze rested on Sadie, on her tears, on the urns. A heaviness pressed against his chest, solid and unrelenting.
Her parents had come home to her like this—after all those years. He could feel the sorrow inside her. But beneath the grief, he saw the quiet strength she refused to let fade.
Sadie always amazed him. Her strength and her vulnerability were tangled together in a way that left a deep, aching pain inside him.noveldrama
Alex’s gaze shifted to Noah, whose mask couldn’t hide the subtle darkening of his eyes. He pivoted toward Sadie, his voice mellowing instinctively. “Sadie, you haven’t eaten yet, have you? Perhaps I could treat you to dinner?” Weariness had settled deep in Sadie’s bones as she prepared to refuse the offer, but Noah cut in before she could speak.
“Mr. Howe,” he drawled with icy contempt, “barging into someone’s home unannounced at this hour crosses a line, wouldn’t you agree? And frankly, Sadie’s personal affairs are none of your business.”

###Chapter 1049:
The hypocrisy of this masked intruder infuriated Alex, especially since Patrick himself refused to give Sadie space. How could Alex possibly abandon Sadie when she was clearly drowning in sorrow?noveldrama
Noah observed Alex’s confident posture as he defended Sadie, and something primal ignited inside him—a fierce, unexplainable rage. Despite his memory gaps, the legal bond remained intact—Sadie was still, undeniably, his wife. Alex had brazenly crossed a line.
Alex’s features hardened as he boldly locked eyes with Noah’s frigid stare. “Correct me if I’m wrong, Mr. Noel, but don’t you have a pregnant wife? Rather than attending to her at home, you’re here disturbing Sadie in the dead of night. Wouldn’t you call that the epitome of inappropriate?”
He paused deliberately, satisfaction threading through his words. Stepping toward Sadie, Alex assumed a protective stance. “Laura’s final request was for me to watch over Sadie. I’m merely fulfilling a deathbed promise, which absolutely justifies my concern.”
Sadie’s brow furrowed deeply as the escalating confrontation grated on her already frayed nerves. She craved nothing but silence and solitude.
“Alex, I have no appetite,” she murmured, exhaustion lacing her words. “Please, enough with this quarreling. I need time alone.” She turned toward Noah with detached eyes. “Mr. Noel, my modest dwelling surely doesn’t deserve your esteemed presence. I must ask you to go.”
Without awaiting responses, Sadie vanished into her bedroom.
At long last, she had brought her parents home.
Grief crashed through her heart with the force of a devastating tsunami. The testosterone-fueled clash between these men only compounded her anguish. All she yearned for was peaceful communion with what remained of her family.
Alex tracked her solitary silhouette until it vanished, a jagged ache lancing through his chest. While disappointment settled in his gut that Sadie hadn’t requested his company, relief washed over him knowing Noah had received the same rejection. It was a small victory that soothed his wounded pride. He pivoted toward Noah, motioning curtly toward the exit. “Mr. Noel, please.”

Behind his mask, Noah’s mouth compressed into a rigid, bloodless line. Casting a final, lingering glance at the sealed bedroom door, he released an inaudible sigh before departing.
Alex cast one last look toward the master bedroom, a storm of conflicting emotions churning behind his eyes. With reluctance etched in every movement, he eased the apartment door shut and slipped away.
Within her sanctuary, Sadie shed the ill-fitting black dress and donned comfortable loungewear. When she ventured out, silence had reclaimed the living room, with only two modest urns newly positioned before Laura’s photograph. She approached with measured steps, her fingertips trailing delicately across the cold ceramic surfaces, infinite sadness swimming in her eyes.
“Daddy, Mommy…” The whispered words escaped her lips like a prayer.

###Chapter 1050:
An idea formed—she would place her parents’ remains alongside Laura’s, reuniting them as the family they once were. Steeling herself with a steadying breath, she gingerly lifted the lid of the first urn. Her body turned to stone as she stared at what lay inside—or rather, what didn’t.
The urn contained nothing but hollow space!
Shock paralyzed Sadie as her heart stuttered painfully in her chest. How was this possible?
Desperate for answers, she frantically unsealed the second urn. This one, too, held only emptiness!
These were undoubtedly the very urns she and Noah had recovered from Evergreen Cemetery’s back hill—the exact location Sharon had identified as her parents’ resting place. What had become of her parents’ remains?
Sharon had explicitly claimed she personally interred Sadie’s parents’ ashes at Evergreen Cemetery following their deaths. What went wrong?
Could it be…
A daring hypothesis suddenly blazed across Sadie’s consciousness. Was it conceivable that her parents were still alive?
The possibility, once conceived, erupted into a wildfire of hope that consumed her entire being. A tidal wave of exhilaration crashed through her body, nearly buckling her knees with its intensity.
With single-minded purpose, Sadie yanked her phone from her pocket, her quivering fingers fumbling as they punched in Samuel’s number.
Samuel answered on the first ring.
“Samuel!”

Excitement threaded through her trembling voice. “Bring Sharon to Pearlhall Apartments immediately! There’s something crucial I need to ask her!”
Despite his confusion, Samuel recognized the raw urgency and steely resolve in her tone. “Understood, Ms. Hudson. I’ll make the arrangements at once!”
Half an hour later, a soft rap echoed against the door of the apartment. Samuel materialized at the threshold, Sharon’s anxious figure hovering behind him.
Sadie rushed forward without hesitation. “Sharon, I need to know—did the police definitively confirm those two burned bodies actually belonged to my parents?”
She searched Sharon’s face, her gaze brimming with fragile, desperate hope.
What if those long-ago identifications had been incorrect?
The possibility, once unleashed in her mind, refused to be silenced, growing louder with each passing second.
Sharon recoiled slightly, blindsided by the unexpected inquiry. Confusion etched lines across her weathered face as she struggled to comprehend why Sadie would ask such a question.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1051:
Sharon retreated into distant memories, her forehead creasing with concentration. “The forensic technology then certainly paled compared to today’s methods. However, detectives discovered a pearl necklace adorning the female victim—an accessory Mrs. Hudson habitually wore, and therefore…”
And thus, on this fragile evidence alone, authorities had established the identities of the departed.
To conclude definitively that the remains belonged to Sadie’s mother, Brenda, based merely on a strand of pearls struck Sadie as appallingly premature.
A leaden weight pulled at Sadie’s heart, yet simultaneously, a whisper of possibility flickered anew within her.
If the authorities’ entire determination had rested upon nothing more substantial than a pearl necklace, perhaps the entire identification process had been flawed.
She clasped Sharon’s weathered hand within her own and guided her toward Laura’s photograph.
Sadie indicated the pair of empty urns positioned beside the photograph. “Sharon, do these vessels look familiar to you?”
Sharon’s attention shifted to the urns. At first, puzzlement clouded her features, then dawning recognition caused her pupils to constrict dramatically.
Disbelief overwhelmed her as she vigorously rubbed her eyes and bent forward for closer inspection.
Could these possibly be the very vessels she had personally chosen to house Dederick’s and Brenda’s earthly remains all those years ago?
The memory crystallized with startling clarity—she had carefully deposited what she believed were their “ashes” into these containers and interred them with her own hands.
Your escape begins with ga ln ov els . com
How, then, could these sacred containers be empty?
The room tilted precariously around Sharon, her knees threatening to buckle beneath the weight of this revelation.
Sadie nodded, her voice trembling. “I went to Evergreen Cemetery earlier tonight, determined to finally bring my parents home. But when I opened them, the urns contained nothing but emptiness.”
The blood drained from Sharon’s face, leaving her complexion ashen and ghostlike.
She shook her head in vehement denial, her lips quivering uncontrollably. “No, it’s impossible… I distinctly remember…”
She had unquestionably committed Dederick and Brenda to their final resting place with her own two hands!
If these vessels had always been vacant, then what mysterious contents had she consigned to the earth all those years ago?
This horrifying revelation cascaded through her nervous system like ice water, chilling her to the marrow.

###Chapter 1052:
Sadie steadied the visibly distressed Sharon with a gentle arm. “Sharon, please try to remain calm. Did my parents leave behind any personal possessions?”
Such items might harbor crucial clues to unraveling this mounting mystery.
Sharon struggled to compose herself, summoning her memories with deliberate concentration. “Back then… everything descended into chaos, with most possessions consumed by the fire. Several personal trinkets belonging to Mrs. Hudson survived, alongside a handful of Mr. Hudson’s everyday items. I preserved some privately as keepsakes, while others accompanied their supposed ‘remains’ into the earth.”
Suddenly, Sharon’s expression transformed as a vital memory surfaced, her eyes widening with newfound clarity.
With trembling urgency, she delved into the worn fabric of her tattered handbag.
Moments later, a diminutive brass key glinted against the rough landscape of her work-hardened palm.
With ceremonial gravity, she extended the key—still radiating with her body’s warmth—toward Sadie. “Sadie, this unlocks my ancient safe. I’ve preserved several treasures belonging to your parents within its confines, believing someday they might find their way back to their family members. Now, providence suggests these very items might illuminate your path forward.”
Throughout the passing years, Sharon had frequently revisited these cherished mementos, each summoning vivid recollections of Dederick’s and Brenda’s presence. Never once had she imagined these preserved fragments of the past might eventually serve as keys to unlock buried truths.
Sadie accepted the tiny key, which nonetheless weighed in her palm like a boulder, her heart churning with a tempest of conflicting emotions. This humble metal sliver represented both the final tangible connection to her parents and her solitary beacon of hope for discovering what truly happened.
Without hesitation, she transferred the precious key to Samuel’s waiting hand.
? : g?ν?
Samuel comprehended instantaneously, acknowledging her unspoken request with a grave nod, requiring no verbal elaboration. He pocketed the key and swiftly departed from the apartment, his footsteps purposeful and determined. Certain imperatives transcended the necessity for verbal instruction; he grasped her intentions completely. His mission now demanded retrieving those potentially revelatory items with utmost urgency—their significance to Sadie’s quest superseded all other considerations.
Meanwhile, within a round-the-clock café adjacent to Pearlhall Apartments, amber lighting bathed the interior while the intoxicating fragrance of freshly ground coffee permeated the atmosphere.
Noah and Alex faced one another across the polished table, their mutual animosity creating a palpable discord that jarringly contradicted the establishment’s inviting ambiance—tension crackling between them like lightning before a storm.
Alex lifted the steaming mug before him and deliberately took a measured sip, never breaking eye contact with his adversary.
Alex’s sharp, cold gaze stayed locked on Noah across from him—the man behind the silver mask. He never imagined Noah, the one believed to have “died” three years ago, would return as Patrick, the powerful figure now shaking the business world with the Burgess Group. Even more surprising was his nerve to appear in front of Sadie again, refusing to leave her alone.

###Chapter 1053:
But exposing him now meant little to Alex. Right now, his only focus was Sadie. He wasn’t going to let anyone hurt her again.
Alex set down his coffee cup, the bottom touching the table with a soft clink. His voice carried a quiet chill, distant and steady. “Mr. Noel, if I’m not mistaken, you’re a married man. So why do you keep showing up, bothering Sadie over and over? It’s unfair—not just to her, but to your wife as well.”
Noah’s lips curled faintly under the mask. A soft, mocking laugh slipped out. He remembered hearing rumors about Alex, the head of Howe Group, being closely tied to Briley from the Wall family. Some even said they were once close to marriage. Yet here Alex was, sitting in front of him, casting judgment.
“Mr. Howe, you make it sound like I’ve committed a crime,” Noah replied, his tone cool. “I’m simply looking out for Sadie. We’ve known each other for a long time. But you, Mr. Howe—weren’t there talks about you and Miss Briley Wall being on the verge of marriage? Funny how fast things change. Your heart seems to wander pretty easily.”
Alex’s face darkened. His hand clenched the coffee cup, the veins on his skin rising. With a loud bang, he slammed the cup onto the table. The dark liquid splashed, leaving stains across the pale surface.
“Noah Wall!” He spat out the name through clenched teeth. His gaze cut sharp, as if it could pierce through the mask and see the man behind it. “In my heart, there’s only ever been Sadie! I’m not like you—claiming to care while betraying her at the same time!”
The memory of Sadie’s pain, the quiet despair she had carried alone because of Noah’s choices three years ago, lit a fire in Alex’s chest. If not for this man, she wouldn’t have suffered so much. And now he dared to show his face again.noveldrama
Alex was determined to protect her. Whatever it took, he wouldn’t let Noah hurt her again.
L?tｅst ch?pt?rs in glnovels.ο
Noah’s frown deepened. He lifted his gaze, studying Alex.
Alex’s gaze burned with a hostility you could almost feel.
“Did we know each other before?” Noah asked, his tone less a challenge, more a quiet question.
Alex froze for a second, then let out a cold, short laugh. “You’re funny, Mr. Noel.”
His laugh carried a sharp edge, heavy with scorn.
His eyes hardened; they aimed straight at Noah, sharp as ice. “But let me give you some advice, Mr. Noel. Stay away from Sadie. You’ve done nothing but hurt her.”
Each word landed with force, pressed out between tight lips.
Inside, Alex’s emotions churned like rough waves.
Did they know each other before? How could he ask that?
Had he forgotten the pain Sadie carried alone all this time? Or was he pretending, playing innocent even now? Either way, Alex wasn’t going to let him near Sadie again. She had suffered enough.
With that, Alex pushed back his chair and walked out of the cafe. He didn’t look back.
Noah’s frown deepened as he watched Alex disappear through the doorway. His fingers drummed rhythmically on the table.

###Chapter 1054:
“Hurt?” he murmured, repeating the word over and over in his mind. What did Alex mean by that? Had he hurt Sadie? How was that even possible? What else could there be between them beyond their professional intersections and his forgotten past?
A voice at the back of his head told Noah that whatever Alex was referring to was connected to the memory he had lost. That man knew something.
Apart from that, there was one other thing Noah knew for sure—Alex was a thorn in his side. His blatant possessiveness of Sadie grated on Noah’s nerves.
Jack cautiously removed himself from the corner and spoke up. “Mr. Noel, shall we head back to Autumn Garden Villa now?”
Noah shifted his intense gaze to his poor assistant. “If I recall correctly, the Sanchez Group has ongoing partnerships with Howe Group… Is that right?”
Jack blinked in surprise and did his best to keep up with his boss’s train of thought. The Sanchez Group? That company had always wanted to meet with his boss and establish an alliance with the Burgess Group, but they had been kept at a distance. Why was Noah bringing them up now?
Although puzzled, Jack nodded in confirmation. “Yes, you’re right. Why do you ask, Mr. Noel?”
Noah stood and buttoned up his suit jacket, his silver mask glinting in the cold light. “It seems that Mr. Howe has a lot of time on his hands these days. Let’s give him something to do, shall we?”
Even then, Jack failed to grasp the meaning behind his words. Noah walked out of the cafe in long, decisive strides, while Jack stood in place, still baffled by the situation.
What on earth had just happened? How had Alex managed to irritate his boss?
Give Alex something to do? That didn’t sound like a good thing at all. That night, Sadie hadn’t slept a wink. She had lain awake until the first rays of sunshine streamed through the window. Sharon’s words kept echoing in her head, along with the image of her parents’ simple grave.
Read the next part at νo
Her face was pallid, and dark circles marked her eyes. Yet, her gaze was bright and determined.
She had to find out what really happened to her parents all those years ago! She was going to expose the villains lurking in the dark, just like she had vowed to herself.
Sadie gingerly got out of bed, her hand finding purchase on the furniture around her as she tried to walk out of the room. She had barely moved away from the bed when a wave of dizziness hit her.
Her body swayed, and her vision went black. In the next second, Sadie collapsed, falling into a faint. She was exhausted, both physically and mentally, and had finally reached her limit.
About half an hour later, Sharon knocked on the master bedroom door. “Sadie? Breakfast is ready, you can eat now.” She waited for a long while, but received no response.
Sharon soon felt a keen sense of foreboding. Sadie had been so upset last night and probably didn’t get a proper night’s rest. Had something happened to her?

###Chapter 1055:noveldrama
The more Sharon thought about it, the more worried she got. Without wasting another second, she twisted the doorknob and pushed open the door.
She found Sadie crumpled on the floor, pale and unconscious.
“Sadie!” Sharon cried out in a panic.
She rushed over and put a trembling finger under Sadie’s nose. Thank God, she was still breathing!
Sharon breathed a sigh of relief, but she knew she couldn’t relax just yet. She fumbled for her phone inside her pocket and frantically dialed emergency services.
At that moment, a sharp knock sounded at the apartment door. Sharon’s heart jumped. Who could be here this early?
She helped Sadie sit up, leaning her gently against the bed, then hurried to the door and opened it. To her surprise, Noah stood outside.
Her heart pounded as she stared at the man in the silver mask. Why had he come?
Noah caught sight of her worried face and frowned. “Sharon, what’s wrong?”
Her voice shook, her eyes filled with tears. “Mr. Noel. Ms. Hudson… she fainted!”
The words struck Noah like lightning. He didn’t hesitate. He brushed past Sharon and rushed into the apartment.
The living room was empty.
He went straight for the master bedroom.
When he opened the door, he found Sadie lying on the carpet beside the bed, her face pale as paper.
Noah’s chest tightened.
Stay tuned at gα?ησνs?com
He rushed over and carefully lifted her into his arms.
Her skin felt cold. He held her close and turned to leave, his steps urgent.
He carried her straight to the nearest private hospital.
At the hospital, the doctor carried out a full examination.
He set down his stethoscope, glanced at Sadie resting pale on the bed, then looked at Noah, whose worry showed in every line of his face. The doctor let out a quiet sigh. “She caught a bad cold. Along with emotional stress and anxiety, it caused her to faint.”
Noah felt a flicker of relief. Still, his concern didn’t leave his eyes.
The doctor paused, his gaze steady on Noah. “But she’s pregnant. You need to be very careful. A mother’s health and emotions affect the baby.”
Noah stood still, frozen. Slowly, he lifted his head, disbelief spreading across his face.
Sadie was pregnant?
The doctor adjusted his glasses as he caught Noah’s stunned expression. “She’s been pregnant for almost two months. How could you, as her family, not know? You’re lucky there’s no serious problem this time, but you need to bring her in for regular check-ups. Make sure she eats well and keeps her spirits up. Go ahead and complete the admission paperwork; we’ll keep her here for two days of observation.”

###Chapter 1056:
Noah took the admission form from the doctor’s hand, nodding slowly, his mind still reeling.
Two months.
His thoughts drifted back to that night after Sadie was kidnapped. Could it have been from that night?
The realization struck him like a surge of electricity.
The child was his!
A rush of joy poured over him, so fierce it nearly overwhelmed him. A smile spread across his face; his eyes lit up with quiet excitement. For a moment, he forgot he was wearing a mask. He forgot he was Patrick—the powerful figure everyone watched.
Right now, he was just a man about to be a father. He quickly left to complete the admission process.
When Noah returned to the hospital room carrying basic toiletries, Sadie had already woken.
She leaned weakly against the headboard, her face pale, her gaze distant.
Sharon sat at her side, her voice gentle as she tried to comfort her. “Sadie, thank goodness you’re awake. You scared me so badly. The doctor said you’re pregnant; you’ve got to take care of yourself. You’re not alone anymore. Mrs. Hudson in heaven wouldn’t want to see you like this.”
Sadie forced a smile, one that hurt more than tears.
Her voice came out rough, weighed down by exhaustion. “I’m fine, Sharon. If I can find the person who killed my parents, if I can let them rest in peace, then even if I die now, I won’t have any regrets.”
That was the resolve she had carried for seventeen years—the reason she kept going.
g?ν.?n –  ?
Noah had just reached the doorway when her words reached him, clear and steady. His steps stopped.
He hadn’t known how deep her obsession ran. He hadn’t realized she would trade her life for this.
For her parents, she was willing to forget herself, willing to risk everything, even their unborn child.
His chest tightened; a sharp ache spread inside him.
He stepped back quietly and stood still in the hallway.
After a moment, he pulled out his phone and dialed Jack. “Look into Sadie’s parents’ past. And the fire at Faron Retreat five years ago. I want every detail. Keep the investigation quiet; no one should catch wind of it.”
On the other end, Jack hesitated, confused.
Why was his boss suddenly digging into Sadie’s family?
But he answered without delay, “Yes, Mr. Noel.”noveldrama
Noah hung up. He took a slow breath, steadying the storm inside him before walking back into the hospital room.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1057:
He approached the bed, his eyes resting on Sadie’s pale face. His voice softened without meaning to. “Sadie, focus on getting better. Let me handle the rest. I’ll find the answers.”
Sadie slowly lifted her gaze toward the man who had materialized at the doorway of her hospital room. For a heartbeat, she froze in disbelief.
Noah?
What on earth was he doing here?
The concern etched on his face and the urgency in his voice earlier—did he somehow know about her pregnancy?
Unease crawled through her veins as she deliberately avoided his penetrating gaze. “I don’t need you meddling in my affairs, Mr. Noel,” she declared, her voice sharp as winter frost. “You’re not welcome here. Please leave.”
With that dismissal, she twisted away to stare out the window, her profile rigid with feigned indifference.
Sharon hastened to diffuse the crackling tension. “Sadie, please reconsider your words,” she implored. “You collapsed earlier, and Mr. Noel was the one who rushed you to the hospital before things got worse.”
Sadie continued to gaze out the window as though the conversation hadn’t registered. “Sharon,” she murmured without turning, “I’m hungry.”
The message landed instantly with Sharon.
Sadie was cleverly orchestrating her exit.
Sharon exhaled softly, realizing Sadie’s unwavering stubbornness.
She cast a meaningful glance toward Noah, her eyes swimming with silent entreaty—a wordless plea for him to protect Sadie from further heartache.
 ?  : g?ν
Without another syllable, Sharon slipped from the room, easing the door shut with a gentle click that somehow echoed with finality.
Noah crossed the room in three purposeful strides and sank onto the chair beside the bed.
He reached out, enveloping Sadie’s slender hand in his warm palm, his grip gentle yet resolute.
Beneath his touch, Sadie’s hand remained achingly cold, like marble left in shadow.
A fierce protectiveness surged through him—he vowed silently to shield her from further pain, to become her sanctuary rather than another source of anguish.
The Hailey situation demanded immediate resolution; procrastination was no longer an option. “Sadie,” he declared with quiet conviction, “I’m not going anywhere. The situation with Hailey—I promise to resolve it swiftly.”
Sadie yanked her hand away, her eyes flashing with biting derision.
A brittle laugh escaped her throat, the sound raw with emotion. “And precisely how will you ‘resolve it,’ Mr. Noel?” she asked, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. “By eliminating your pregnant wife to validate your supposed innocence?”
The audacity of Noah’s promise staggered her—how dare he make such claims while Hailey carried his child?
.

.noveldrama
###Chapter 1058:
And he even offered hollow assurances to her—the sheer absurdity of it all scraped against her already raw nerves.
Noah’s brow knitted into a deep furrow as shadows claimed his features.
Her accusation blindsided him completely. “The baby Hailey carries,” he stated with unexpected firmness, “isn’t mine.”
His declaration whipped Sadie’s attention back to him, her face a canvas of naked disbelief. How could that possibly be true?
If it was not his child, then why would Hailey fabricate such a momentous lie?
What purpose could Hailey’s deception possibly serve?
Her stunned expression lanced through Noah’s heart like a physical wound.
He recognized the skepticism brewing behind her eyes—of course, she wouldn’t believe him.
He lifted his hand in solemn oath, his expression grave as stone. “I swear on everything sacred to me, if the child Hailey carries belongs to me, I—”
“No!” The sound escaped as a strangled gasp.
Sadie lunged forward, her palm flying to seal his lips.
She couldn’t bear to hear another syllable of this.noveldrama
What value did such promises hold when whispered from lips that had already betrayed her?
“I need solitude right now,” she whispered, her voice fraying at the edges. “Please go.”
Noah gently pried her hand away, cradling it between both of his as though it were something infinitely precious.
g0ν..  ? ?  
With tender precision, he tucked the warm blanket snugly around her shoulders. “Rest now,” he murmured, his voice a soothing balm. “I’ll wait just beyond that door. Call for me at the slightest need.” Recognizing her desperate need for solitude, he retreated from pushing further, respecting the fragile boundary between them.
Sadie offered no response, merely sinking back against the pillows and allowing her eyelids to flutter closed.
If it was not Noah’s child growing within Hailey, then whose seed had taken root there?
According to Hailey’s own statement, Noah cherished her deeply.
Yet why would she carry another man’s child within her?
Had she been manipulated, a pawn in some elaborate deception? The possibility clung to Sadie’s consciousness like a stubborn shadow, refusing to dissipate no matter how she tried to dismiss it.
Without realizing it, exhaustion claimed her as her eyelids grew leaden, dragging her down into the merciful embrace of slumber.
Meanwhile, beyond the sterile hospital walls, Sharon clutched a bag of carefully selected light dishes as she headed back toward Sadie’s room. She had barely emerged from the restaurant entrance when a sleek black sedan screeched to a halt directly before her.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1059:
Sharon froze, her instincts screaming at her to veer away from the ominous vehicle.
Before she could react, the car doors flew open and several imposing figures in pristine black suits erupted from within.
Terror seized Sharon’s heart as she spun on her heel, desperate to retreat to safety.
She managed only a single step before colliding with a wall of black-suited men who had materialized behind her, cutting off her escape route.
The men seized her arms with bruising force, hauling her struggling form toward the waiting vehicle.noveldrama
Despite her fierce resistance, Sharon’s aging strength proved futile against their ruthless efficiency.
A startled cry tore from her throat before they roughly bundled her into the vehicle’s dark interior.
The car door slammed with a sickening finality that echoed through the quiet street.
With a throaty growl, the sedan’s engine surged to life as the vehicle peeled away, leaving nothing but scattered bags of still-steaming food abandoned on the unforgiving pavement.
Two hours crawled by before Sadie’s consciousness resurfaced, her eyelids fluttering open in the quiet hospital room.
Harsh afternoon sunlight streamed through the blinds, forcing her to squint against its intrusive brightness.
With careful movements, she shifted her stiff limbs and leveraged herself upright against the cool metal headboard.
The room stood eerily vacant—no sign of life but her own shallow breathing.
M ?ρ?α  ?ασν.?σ?
Had Noah abandoned his promise so quickly?
An unexpected wave of desolation crashed over her, hollowing out her chest as though a vital piece of herself had been quietly excised.
The door burst open without warning.
Noah surged into the room, crossing to her bedside in urgent strides, his face taut with concern. “Sadie,” he announced, tension threading through every syllable, “Sharon has disappeared.”
The blood drained from Sadie’s face at his revelation. “What?” she whispered, her voice barely audible. Her body reacted before her mind could catch up, automatically lurching toward the edge of the bed.
The abrupt movement triggered a knife-like pain that sliced through her lower abdomen.
“Ah!” A pained cry escaped her lips as icy beads of sweat instantly materialized across her forehead.
Noah lunged forward, his strong hand catching her shoulder with steadying gentleness.
Sadie’s fragile physical state was in no condition to absorb such devastating news.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1060:noveldrama
The news of Sharon’s vanishing had struck Noah with equal force, though he managed to maintain his composure.
“How could this happen?”
This was clearly orchestrated by someone.
“Sadie,” he urged, his voice deliberately steady, “try to remain calm and listen. I’ve dispatched a search team already. They’ve combed the entire hospital vicinity, but found nothing yet.”
He squeezed her shoulder gently. “Your wellbeing is paramount right now—we need you strong and clear-headed.”
Sadie lunged forward, seizing Noah’s wrist with unexpected force, as though his words had never reached her ears. Her ice-cold fingertips quivered against his skin.
How could Sharon have vanished? Such a gentle soul, utterly isolated in Jazmah without family or meaningful connections. What fate could have befallen her?
Could it be… those people who had killed her parents? Were they now hunting Sharon?
She couldn’t stand by while harm came to Sharon! She had once helped her parents, after all! Sadie was counting on Sharon to help her uncover more about their past.
“We must find Sharon! She’s in danger!” Sadie’s voice splintered with emotion. “Noah, please—you must help me find her!”
Raw panic blazed in Sadie’s eyes, helplessness etched across her features as she pleaded with Noah.
Noah felt a sharp ache in his chest, radiating through his body. He enveloped her frigid fingers within the sanctuary of his warm palm.
Sharon’s disappearance bore no trace of coincidence. She had barely revealed the past to Sadie and surrendered that vital key before vanishing.
Continue at ?a?oν?
The orchestrators lurked in the shadows, executing their plans with alarming swiftness. They were determined to keep Sadie from excavating the truth.
For years, Sharon had maintained invisibility in Jazmah, cultivating no relationships. Her abrupt disappearance signaled only one thing—those people had resurfaced, making their calculated move. Sharon teetered on the precipice of genuine peril.
“I will,” Noah rasped, his voice like gravel. “I understand what Sharon means to you. Cast your worries aside—I’ll return her to you unharmed.”
With tender deliberation, he drew Sadie into the fortress of his embrace, nestling his chin against her crown.
Sadie melted against the bulwark of his chest, the metronomic cadence of his heartbeat anchoring her tumultuous thoughts. Gradually, mental clarity returned to her.
Panic and hysteria were luxuries she couldn’t indulge— not when Sharon’s life hung in the balance.
Sadie inhaled deeply, summoning courage as she raised her head from his chest. Vulnerability still lingered in her gaze like morning mist. “Noah, Sharon… will she survive this?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1061:
Noah studied her ashen complexion and the anxiety swimming in her eyes, his heart constricting with shared anguish.
He lifted his hand, tenderly brushing away the crystalline tears clinging to her lashes. “Yes, she’ll be okay,” he declared with iron certainty. “Trust me.”
Finding Sharon transcended urgency— he needed answers not only for Sadie but to unravel the enigmas multiplying within his own heart.
Those responsible would face his unrestrained wrath.
With careful attention, Noah eased Sadie back against the pillows. “Your priority must be regaining strength, looking after yourself, and…” He hesitated momentarily. “Our baby.”
His tone melted involuntarily when referencing their unborn child, tenderness suffusing each syllable.
“Guards are already stationed throughout the hospital. Safety is assured. Focus on resting, and I’ll keep you informed of developments.”
Sadie inclined her head in acknowledgment. Impulsive actions would only hinder Noah’s efforts and exacerbate their predicament. Patience became her sole recourse.
And the baby… Reality washed over her anew. Their child still grew within her, depending on her vigilance. She needed to prioritize both their wellbeing.
“Then make haste,” she implored, clutching Noah’s hand. “And shield yourself from harm.”
Noah’s gaze bored into hers with profound intensity before he descended, pressing his lips against her forehead in a solemn promise. “I will.”
He pivoted sharply and marched from the room, determination fueling each step.noveldrama
Barely minutes later, hinges creaked as the door swung inward again. Sadie presumed Noah had forgotten something crucial and parted her lips to inquire.
   ? glovè?.
But her gaze met not Noah’s familiar features but Blaine’s unexpected presence.
Her brow furrowed with confusion. What business brought Blaine to her hospital bedside at such an hour?
“Has something disrupted operations at the company?” Sadie questioned, apprehension tingling along her spine.
Dishevelment clung to Blaine as he entered, anxiety etched across his features. Upon witnessing Sadie propped against her pillows—pallid yet alert—relief cascaded through him in a quiet exhalation. Thank goodness. Her condition appeared stable rather than critical.
News of Sadie’s collapse had sent him racing through traffic to reach the hospital.
“No, nothing catastrophic,” Blaine assured her, straightening his tie. “But the Higgins family dispatched someone to our offices today, insistent on setting your wedding date.”
“I heard you collapsed, so I came right away,” Blaine said, a note of urgency in his tone.
Sadie’s hand moved instinctively to her stomach.
That crafty old Rodger—he must’ve orchestrated this. Nathan likely had no idea.
Their betrothal had always been a calculated decision, a stepping stone. Now that Nathan had secured the reins of the Higgins Group, there was no more need for pretenses.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1062:
“I’m alright,” she replied evenly. “Could you inform Nathan I’d like to end the engagement?”
Blaine gave a slight nod, catching on instantly. He’d always understood that the arrangement was a strategic ploy to deceive Rodger. But with Nathan now in power, its usefulness had expired.
Sadie’s condition had changed everything. Her well-being now eclipsed all else.
“Consider it done. Don’t stress about the firm—I’ll manage things. Just rest and recover.”
Sadie acknowledged him with a faint motion, trusting completely in Blaine’s competence.
They exchanged brief updates on operations, but Blaine quickly noticed the fatigue settling in her features and chose not to linger.
As he stepped out into the corridor, he retrieved his phone and rang Nathan.noveldrama
The call was picked up quickly, Nathan sounding rushed and regretful. “Mr. Castro, I had no idea. My dad acted behind my back and sent someone over to talk about the wedding. I just found out. I swear I’ll fully cooperate—there won’t be any problems from me.”
Blaine gave him silent credit. Unlike his manipulative father, Nathan seemed to know his place and when to yield.
“Glad to hear it,” Blaine said coolly. “I trust you’ll resolve things appropriately.”
A beat passed. Nathan wondered if Patrick had been informed. Since learning that Rodger had approached Wall Group, Nathan had been nervous—afraid of provoking Patrick’s temper.
Patrick was possessive of Sadie. If he discovered this, Nathan wouldn’t survive the fallout.
“Patrick isn’t aware… right?” Nathan asked, cautiously.
Don’t miss fresh updates on gα?ησνs?c?m
A ghost of a grin appeared on Blaine’s lips. So even Nathan had someone he feared.
“Well, well. Seems even you know when to tiptoe,” he said dryly, just as another call buzzed in.
Raising a brow, he added, “I’ve got another matter to handle. We’re done here.”
Blaine ended the call and immediately answered the second one.
It was Alfredo Williamson, the long-time butler of the Castro family’s manor.
“Sir, your grandfather has requested your presence at the manor. He says there’s something urgent he must speak with you about.”
Blaine froze. His grandfather had been overseas for treatment. When had he returned? And why hadn’t he been told?
Still, Blaine didn’t press for answers over the phone. “Understood. I’ll be there soon.”
He pocketed his phone and made his way to the elevator.
Roughly half an hour later, he stepped into the grand halls of Castro Manor.
Something about the air felt off—too quiet, like the calm before a storm. In the living room, Ralph sat poised on the sofa, coffee in hand, his expression stony and unreadable.
Blaine pulled on his usual easy charm as he approached. “Grandfather.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1063:
At the sound of his voice, Ralph set the mug down with deliberate calm and looked up, his gaze sharp and assessing. “How has Sadie been lately?”
The question hit Blaine like a punch to the gut. A cold unease swept through him.
Ralph had always emphasized Sadie’s importance—and now she was lying in a hospital bed. If he found out, Blaine would be in serious trouble.
Masking his anxiety, Blaine maintained his casual demeanor. “She’s doing well—resting, eating, keeping healthy.” He even threw in a carefree hand gesture to sell it.
Ralph’s eyes narrowed. His lips pressed into a hard line. “Do you know what she’s been up to recently?”
That caught Blaine off guard. He truly didn’t know.
She was supposed to be recuperating, with her business duties delegated to him. What could she possibly be involved in? Sneaking out for fun? No way—not in her condition.
But Ralph’s piercing stare didn’t waver. He then looked at Alfredo and gave a silent cue.
Alfredo gave a respectful nod, then issued a calm but commanding order. “Bring her in.”
Though his voice was calm, it carried unmistakable authority.
Blaine blinked in confusion. Bring who in?
Footsteps echoed faintly from down the corridor.
Two men in dark suits emerged, imposing and silent.
Between them, they supported a woman whose body hung loosely between them. Her appearance was disheveled—matted hair, colorless skin, eyelids shut. It was Sharon.
Blaine stared at the unfamiliar woman, a crease forming between his brows. He couldn’t place her face. What new scheme was his grandfather orchestrating?
   @ gν﹒
“Who is that?” he asked, his voice laced with unease.
Ralph took his time, sipping his coffee again. When he spoke, his voice carried a subtle exhaustion.
“It’s not easy to explain. Sadie’s been unraveling old threads about her parents. Blaine, she’s heading into dangerous territory. Can you see that?”
There was a rare sternness in Ralph’s voice, and his expression bore a gravity that unsettled Blaine.
His thoughts scrambled.
Sadie’s parents? Wasn’t it nearly two decades ago that the Hudsons vanished after their financial collapse?
Why dig into the past now? And the way his grandfather spoke—there was clearly more to the story than he’d been told.
“What really happened, Grandpa? Sadie’s parents…” Blaine asked, needing clarity. This was no longer about dusty family history. It had teeth.
Ralph’s eyes dimmed, and his tone turned cutting. “There are things that should remain buried. Just do what I say and don’t get involved in anything else.” His voice had a sharp edge to it—firm and final. Blaine kept his reply to himself. Pressing further would only spark his grandfather’s infamous temper.

###Chapter 1064:
Ralph’s voice dropped again as he turned to the unconscious woman.
“Her name is Sharon Buckley. She worked for Sadie’s parents half a decade ago, taking care of them. Come up with a reason to quietly remove her from Jazmah. Somewhere distant. And whatever happens, Sadie must never trace her. This has to be done cleanly, with no loose ends.”
Although burning with curiosity, Blaine only nodded. “Understood.” He wouldn’t push his luck again.
Turning to the nearby guards, he said, “Come with me.” Then he strode out without looking back.
Once the door clicked shut, silence settled across the grand living room.
Only Ralph and Alfredo remained.
Alfredo stepped forward, concern etched deep into his lined features. “Sir, I don’t believe this secret will hold much longer. Shouldn’t we be honest with Ms. Hudson? You know how determined she is when her mind’s made up.”
Alfredo had served under Ralph long enough to know Sadie’s relentless nature well.
Ralph’s answer was a slow shake of the head, emotion clouding his features. He let out a breath, long and heavy. “No. Let the dust of the older generation’s grudges settle with time. The young don’t need to carry that darkness. She’s already endured too much.”
Meanwhile, in the courtyard, Blaine and the guards gently placed Sharon into the car. He hesitated, his eyes flicking back to the illuminated halls of Castro Manor. His grandfather had seemed both commanding… and strangely worn. Whatever had happened today clearly rattled him. What secrets had left him this shaken? And who exactly was this woman they were spiriting away?
A storm of uncertainty rattled Blaine’s mind, unsettling his focus. He inhaled slowly, trying to calm the chaos in his brain.
  : g?ν
“Let’s go,” he told the driver.
The black sedan eased away from the Castro Manor and melted into the evening’s gloom.
Before they even reached the highway, multiple shadowy vehicles surged forward from concealed positions, cutting them off. Tires squealed, shattering the silence.
Blaine felt his stomach lurch as their ride halted abruptly. He froze momentarily, then glanced forward.
The front automobile’s door swung open, and a recognizable silhouette emerged. The figure wore a sleek onyx ensemble, expression cold and concealed. It was Jack—Patrick’s most dependable assistant.
Blaine’s eyes narrowed.noveldrama
Jack? Patrick’s assistant? What was he doing here? Were they targeting Sharon? Did Patrick already uncover something?
Blaine stepped out of the car, his expression one of bewilderment. “What is Mr. Noel doing here? Has he changed his mind? Is he finally willing to sign the contract?”
But why now? In fact, why hadn’t he gone straight to the office to begin with? That would have been the most reasonable approach. Blaine’s signature smirk was still plastered on his face as he muttered these questions to himself.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1065:
Jack approached him with a blank look on his face and bowed slightly in greeting. “Mr. Castro, my boss would like to have a word with you.”
Blaine glanced back at the black sedan he had just exited. The two bodyguards were visibly tense, while Sharon remained unconscious. No matter how he looked at it, this scene was not suitable for any sort of business negotiation.noveldrama
Was this actually about Sharon? How did Patrick even know Sharon was at Castro Manor?
Blaine’s mind was racing, though he somehow managed to keep his composure.
After a moment’s consideration, he nodded at Jack and followed him to the black Maybach parked a few steps away.
The door to the backseat was opened, and Blaine slid inside the vehicle. Noah was sitting there, his legs crossed, his hands perched on his knees. Yet despite his relaxed posture, there was an unmistakable air of danger around him.
Blaine suddenly found it difficult to breathe. He cleared his throat and mustered a smile. “Mr. Noel, what—what’s going on here?”
Noah tipped his head slightly to the side, his sharp gaze landing on Blaine. “Shouldn’t I be asking you that, Mr. Castro? What exactly is your family trying to do?”
His calm tone rang with authority, and Blaine felt his heart sink. His back broke out in a cold sweat.
So Patrick knew.
Blaine’s smile became even more strained, almost looking like a grimace. He scrambled for an excuse, desperate to brush the matter aside and laugh it off.
But Noah spoke again, squashing any attempt to find an easy way out. “Your family has gone to great lengths to abduct Sharon. What is your goal here? Is the Castro family trying to—”
family involved in the death of Sadie’s parents five years ago?”
New stories uploaded on g?lnσνls?com
Blaine froze, a vein bulging on his forehead. This accusation was not to be taken lightly!
Recently, Patrick had been so close to Sadie, and she was even carrying Patrick’s baby.
If Patrick truly believed that the Castro family had anything to do with that incident—or worse yet, if he convinced Sadie of the same—then this misunderstanding would spiral out of control.
If that happened, his grandfather would definitely not let him go easily.
“Mr. Noel, you can’t say such words so carelessly!” Blaine raised his right hand, as if to swear an oath. “I swear on everything I hold dear, the Castro family is innocent. We have no hand in the death of Sadie’s parents! Besides, Sadie’s grandfather and mine shared a deep friendship that spanned decades. We have no reason to harm their family.”
The words came out of him in a rush, and only when he was done did he take the time to gauge Noah’s reaction.
However, his eyes remained unreadable underneath his silver mask. Blaine swallowed the lump in his throat. Patrick’s presence was simply too overwhelming.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1066:
“To be honest with you, Mr. Noel, I don’t even know what happened five years ago. My grandfather called me back to the manor out of nowhere, then instructed me to send Sharon away. I was told to take her as far away as possible, and to make sure Sadie never found out. I did ask him what was going on, but the old man refused to answer. I’m just as clueless as you in all of this!” Blaine spread his hands, his face frustrated and earnest at the same time.
Noah’s brows furrowed as he studied Blaine. He was obviously rattled, but he seemed sincere.
It didn’t look like he was lying.
He was right, too—the Castro family had no reason to target the Hudson family.
“I want to speak to your grandfather,” Noah suddenly said in a tone that brooked no argument.
A flicker of hesitation crossed Blaine’s eyes.noveldrama
Before he left the manor, he had noticed that his grandfather was uncharacteristically somber and weary. Clearly, the old man didn’t want to talk about the matter, let alone with an outsider.
Patrick’s request was proving to be a tricky one.
“I will do my best to pass your message along,” Blaine said cautiously. “But I have to tell you—I cannot guarantee that my grandfather would agree to meet with you.”
Noah just gave him a small nod.
“Then, please wait for me to get back to you.” Relieved, Blaine quickly walked out of the Maybach and hurried back to his own vehicle. He then instructed the driver to turn around and head straight to Castro Manor.
Meanwhile, the black Maybach remained where it was.
Your next story starts here g?lnσνs?c?m
After a few minutes of waiting, Jack bent over and peeked into the backseat. “What do you think, Mr. Noel? Is Blaine telling the truth?”
Noah drummed his fingers on his knee before rolling the window fully open. He was immediately greeted by the cold night breeze. He fixed his gaze in the direction Blaine had left and shook his head. “It’s too early to make a judgment.”
He had initially been puzzled when he saw the footage of Sharon being taken away in a car registered to the Castro family.
The Castro family had been one of the founding pillars of the Wall Group. They had stood alongside Noah’s grandfather and father as their empire flourished. Their ties to both the Wall and Hudson families ran deep, especially Ralph, who had watched Noah grow up. Why would they take Sharon? And why were they trying to stop Sadie from uncovering the truth about the past?
The questions were piling up, with no answer in sight.
For now, only Ralph could provide any semblance of enlightenment.
About half an hour later, Blaine emerged from Castro Manor and made his way toward the Maybach, his strides brisk and resolute.
He stopped a short distance away and nodded in Noah’s direction, signaling that his grandfather was willing to speak to him.
.

###Chapter 1067:
Noah smoothed the hem of his suit jacket, exhaled slowly, and swung open the car door.
With measured steps and a calm resolve, he crossed the gravel path toward Castro Manor.
Inside, the living room was cloaked in silence. Ralph sat poised in the center of the sofa, spine straight and hands folded. His expression was carved from stone—stern, still, unreadable.
Noah halted a respectful distance away and inclined his head. “Mr. Castro.”
The elder’s gaze rose, deliberate and unhurried.
His eyes flicked to the silver mask veiling Noah’s face, lingered a beat, then slid toward Blaine and Alfredo, who hovered like shadows at the room’s edge.
“Blaine, Alfredo, leave us.” The words were soft, yet each syllable landed with immutable finality.
Blaine—who had entered shoulder to shoulder with Noah—and Alfredo, stationed like a sentinel nearby, stiffened.
Blaine’s jaw twitched. He drew a breath, the beginning of a question rising in his throat.
Why the need for secrecy? What did his grandfather see in Patrick that warranted such discretion?
But before the thought could become sound, Ralph’s eyes snapped to him. There was no mistaking the message in that stare.
Blaine’s protest crumbled before it could take shape.
With a respectful bow, he turned on his heel and exited the room, Alfredo trailing silently behind him.
The living room, vast and steeped in muted grandeur, now held a silence so dense it felt almost deliberate.
. =  ?
Noah crossed the room with unhurried steps and settled into the seat across from Ralph.
Lifting his gaze, he met the elder’s scrutinizing stare with cool precision. “If you have something to say, Mr. Castro, just say it,” Noah said, his voice clipped, deliberate. “Sending away your grandson and your butler—does that mean this is something you can’t afford to say aloud?”
Ralph adjusted his glasses with slow, practiced fingers. His eyes narrowed as he studied the man before him.
The mask might have hidden half his face, but not the truth. The stature, the voice, and most of all, the eyes—dark, stormy, unmistakable—stirred memories long buried.
Even through the years and the hardening of time, the boy’s resemblance to his late friend Nigel was undeniable.
“Noah, it’s been a long time.”
Noah’s hand, resting lightly on a porcelain cup, froze—just for a breath. He had underestimated Ralph. Even though he was wearing a mask, the old man had seen through it with ease.
With a quiet sigh of resignation, Noah lifted his hand and peeled away the silver mask.

###Chapter 1068:
His face emerged from behind the veil—angular, striking, and familiar. Nigel’s features lived in him, but the warmth was gone; what remained was sharper, colder, honed by loss and time.
Ralph did not flinch.
He merely reached for his cup and took a slow, measured sip, as though he had known this moment would arrive.
“Blaine already told me why you’ve come,” he said calmly.
Noah set the mask down on the coffee table with quiet finality. His expression remained unreadable. “But I want to hear it from you,” he said. “What really happened five years ago?”
Ralph’s fingers absently traced the rim of his cup. His eyes, once fierce, flickered with a weary complexity. A sigh slipped past his lips—long and weighted.
“Ah, it’s a long and tangled tale—knotted with old grudges and the wreckage left by the generation before yours,” Ralph said, his voice low and lined with weariness. He paused for a moment, collecting scattered thoughts.
“Sadie’s grandfather, Absolon, once held a prominent place in Wall Group, but ideological rifts—clashing visions of how the empire should be run—drove a wedge between him and the Wall family. Rather than wage a war he couldn’t win…”
Absolon chose to leave Wall Group of his own accord. Later, he married Laura—Sadie’s grandmother. From that union came a daughter, Brenda. Brenda eventually married Dederick, the head of Hudson Group. They are Sadie’s parents.noveldrama
Brenda saw too much of the corporate world’s toll in her father’s life and her husband’s. She turned her back on finance entirely, choosing the pursuit of science instead. But when the Hudson empire collapsed into ruin, Brenda and Dederick vanished, like ghosts swallowed by the wind.
Ralph’s voice grew more burdened with every word.

“Then, five years ago, on Labor Day, I received a message from them. They resurfaced—briefly—and asked to meet me at Faron Retreat. It was there that Brenda entrusted Sadie into my care. She didn’t offer many details—only that if something ever went wrong, she wanted someone to protect her daughter. So when the storm hit Wall Group and Sadie was left adrift, I didn’t hesitate. I came back from abroad to stand behind her, to help her steady the wreckage.”
Noah sat in silence, the furrow between his brows deepening.
The history aligned with what he had pieced together, but it left critical gaps. Why did Ralph abduct Sharon? And why had his search for answers drawn so much resistance?
“And what happened after that?” he asked, his voice cool but insistent.
Ralph held Noah’s gaze—grief, guilt, something old and unresolved stirring in his eyes.
“Not long after Labor Day…” he murmured, voice heavy with memory, “Faron Retreat went up in flames.”
“Two burned corpses were discovered—one male, one female. But that wasn’t the full story. Further inspection revealed that the burial plots marked for Brenda and Dederick had been disturbed—both urns were vacant.”

###Chapter 1069:
A jolt of unease gripped Noah.
What the hell was happening?
Ralph exhaled slowly, the weight of his thoughts pressing down. “Brenda’s academic work delved into perilous biological experiments. It drew the eye of an elusive group called Wolfpack. They had shadowed her movements for a while. As for the missing ashes, I believe their agents retrieved them. If they ever catch wind that Brenda had a child—Sadie—she’ll become their next target. They’ll stop at nothing to find her. That’s why I wanted to send Sharon away. She holds too much information. If she’s captured, the outcome could be catastrophic.”
Noah’s hands balled instinctively.noveldrama
Wolfpack was notorious worldwide. The name was whispered with dread, synonymous with brutality and silence.
No one knew who led them, but their reach spanned continents, and their reputation for lethal efficiency was unmatched. If Sadie was truly on their radar, she was in mortal peril.
Noah’s chest tightened with guilt. He’d judged Ralph too harshly. Rising, he gave a deep bow. “Mr. Castro, I was wrong. Please forgive my earlier actions.”
Ralph waved dismissively, his eyes tired. “Forget it. Sadie’s safety depends on secrecy.”
Noah gave a solemn nod. “Understood. I’ll take the necessary steps.”
Ralph appeared marginally comforted, though concern still shadowed his face.
Meanwhile, in the garden of Castro Manor, Blaine wore a hole in the grass with his pacing.
His expression flickered with frustration. Why was his grandfather keeping him in the dark?
Why exile both him and Alfredo with no explanation?

Every so often, Blaine’s gaze landed on Alfredo, who studiously looked away, pretending not to notice.
Feeling the tension, Alfredo attempted a nervous laugh. “Don’t glare at me like that. I have no clue what your grandfather is planning either.”
Blaine snorted. He wasn’t buying it.
Alfredo had always been in sync with Ralph—as if he could read his mind with a glance. And now he claimed ignorance? Impossible. Blaine opened his mouth to push for answers, but just then, the living room doors creaked open.
Noah stepped into the open air, securing a silver mask to his face. Seeing him, Blaine rushed toward him. “Mr. Noel, what did my grandfather tell you?”
Without stopping, Noah replied coolly, “Nothing. Just ensure Sharon leaves immediately. Jack will help you.”
Blaine blinked in disbelief.
Patrick had only been inside the living room for a short while, yet now he agreed to Ralph’s plan? What kind of secret agreement had the two of them reached in there?
Noah paid no heed to Blaine’s startled look and exited the estate without a backward glance.

###Chapter 1070:
He slid into the sleek black Maybach luxury sedan parked at the curb. The car door snapped shut with a firm click, severing any chance for Blaine to catch his eyes.
Blaine remained rooted to the spot, his expression darkening as the car accelerated down the lane.
What were his grandfather and Patrick thinking?
The more he replayed their recent moves, the clearer it became—this was far from ordinary.
Inside the car, Jack observed Noah through the rearview mirror. His mask veiled much of his face, revealing only the chiseled edge of his jaw and those unreadable, shadowed eyes.
Emotion churned beneath their surface, quiet yet turbulent.
“What’s the directive now, Mr. Noel?” Jack asked.
Noah’s slender digits rhythmically tapped his thigh, an almost silent cadence forming.
Ralph’s warning still rang in his ears.
The revelation about Sadie’s parents being targeted by a perilous global network had thrown him off balance.
And Sharon—she held knowledge that could spell disaster. If captured by Wolfpack, not only would she be in danger, but Sadie’s life might also unravel.
Ralph had every reason to be concerned.
Noah closed his eyes, then reopened them—now steely and void of warmth.
His voice, when it came, was gravelly yet unwavering. “We’re going to need a corpse.”
Jack couldn’t comprehend the sudden request from his boss for a corpse, but years of dutiful service had trained him not to question odd demands.
Your update hub: g?lησνs?c?m
Without hesitation, he nodded and began coordinating the necessary steps.
Noah’s reasoning had always been a mystery to him.
Roughly three hours later, Noah stepped quietly into Sadie’s hospital room.
Sadie, dressed in a hospital gown and barefoot, was pacing restlessly. Her skin was pale, dark circles shadowed her red-rimmed eyes, and her tangled hair framed a face drained of all energy.noveldrama
Sharon had been missing for quite some time. There was no word—no sign.
Sleep was a distant luxury.
The longer the silence stretched, the more peril Sharon might be in.
A pang struck Noah as he noticed how much thinner Sadie looked.
Sadie stopped in her tracks when she heard the sound of his footsteps. Her head snapped toward the door. When she saw Noah, a flicker of desperation lit in her gaze.
She nearly stumbled in her rush toward him. “Noah!” Her voice cracked with urgency. “Did you find her? Is she okay?” She tightly grasped Noah’s arm.

###Chapter 1071:
Noah could feel her hope bearing down on him. His voice caught in his throat.
He looked away, avoiding her eyes for a long moment, then forced himself to meet her gaze. “Sadie…” His voice was a whisper. “You’ll need to prepare yourself.”
Sadie’s face fell instantly.
Confusion spread across her features.
Her mouth opened, but her voice was barely a rasp.
“What are you saying? Something happened to Sharon? Just say it!” Color drained from her cheeks as fear consumed her expression. She looked like she couldn’t breathe.
Noah gave a subtle signal toward the doorway.
Two guards entered, a stretcher between them, veiled in a pristine white sheet. The fabric seemed to shine cruelly under the fluorescent lights, searing Sadie’s eyes.
A wave of dizziness swept over her as she stepped back unsteadily, nearly collapsing.
No.
It couldn’t be Sharon!
Her head shook in denial, tears blurring everything.
In a frenzy, she tore away from Noah’s grasp, stumbling forward with reckless urgency. “Sharon!” she screamed.
Noah’s expression shifted, and he swiftly stepped forward, enclosing her from behind with a firm grip around her torso.
He anchored Sadie to him, trying to steady her as she unraveled.
“Sadie, calm down!” he urged.
L€$? tя? ?η glov?l.оm
She thrashed in his hold, arms swinging in frantic protest. “Let me go! Don’t touch me!” she screamed. “That’s not Sharon! That can’t be her!”
Noah didn’t loosen his grasp. Her fists struck his chest, but he remained still, each blow cutting deeper than the last.
His chest ached with helplessness—this was far more than she could endure.
Lowering his head until his lips brushed her hair, he spoke gently, heavy with grief. “Don’t look, Sadie. Sharon wouldn’t want you to see her like this. I’m so, so sorry. Please—hold on.”
The fight left Sadie all at once, like breath sucked out by a storm. Her resistance faded slowly, and she collapsed against Noah, drained and trembling.
A choking sound escaped her lips as emotion overtook her, erupting into raw, unrestrained sobs.
The terror she had buried deep within erupted without warning.
“Sharon…” she wept. “Why did it come to this? She promised she’d stay put until I found my parents. Why did she break that promise?” Sharon and Laura were the only ones who were aware of the past of Sadie’s parents.
Sadie had counted on Sharon to uncover more fragments of their past.noveldrama

###Chapter 1072:
She longed for tales from before the tragedy.
But now, all of it had slipped beyond reach.
The final thread had snapped.noveldrama
Her mother’s and father’s demise, now Sharon’s—it felt like an orchestrated pattern.
Who was behind this web of cruelty?
Why such merciless precision?
Sadie gripped Noah’s sleeve with trembling hands, her reddened eyes locking onto his with desperation. “Noah, I need answers,” she said, her voice sharp and shaky. “What exactly happened to her? Who took her life?”
Noah shifted his gaze toward the guards at the entrance and gave a brief signal.
Understanding immediately, they lifted the stretcher and departed. Noah gently guided Sadie to sit, then sat beside her. “Sadie, you have to stay calm,” he urged softly. “Focus on what I’m about to say.” Taking a moment, he gathered his thoughts before continuing in a somber tone, “I checked the surveillance around the hospital. It showed that after Sharon finished buying food, she was forcibly taken into a black car. The car vanished into an unmonitored alley—after that, there were no further visuals. My team couldn’t recover anything useful.” He inhaled sharply before adding, “Her remains turned up on the outskirts, far from here.”
Though his voice stayed composed, every sentence cut into Sadie like a blade.
Kidnapped after buying food and discovered lifeless hours later?
The explanation felt hollow, filled with voids.
Her chest tightened under the weight of helplessness.
  : g?ν
The enigma surrounding her parents endured, and now the only person who might have held a key was gone.
She averted her gaze, drained.
“I need some time alone,” she said. “Please, leave.”
Noah looked worried. His eyes showed it, even though he kept his mouth shut.
He wanted to stay. Sadie needed someone now more than ever. But the look in her eyes—distant, drained—held him back.
Sadie said nothing. She stared out the window, her frame still and fragile.
Noah let out a quiet sigh and stood up. “Alright. Try to rest. I’ll be just outside. Call me if you need anything.”
He stepped out, closing the door behind him with care, leaving the room in silence.
Sadie slowly got to her feet. Her bare soles met the cold floor, the chill slicing through the fog in her mind.
Something didn’t sit right.
She knew what Noah was capable of—the reach he had, the people he could call.
How could he have found nothing? Especially after being gone all night and only showing up again now. There was no way he came back empty-handed. He was hiding something.
.

###Chapter 1073:
The thought hit hard. Doubt wrapped around Sadie’s chest, tightening. She took a deep breath, trying to stay steady. Her fingers trembled as she dialed a number. “Samuel, I need you to look into two things—quietly. First, investigate everything about Sharon’s disappearance and her murder. I want the full picture. Second, track Patrick’s movements—from when he left the hospital until he came back.”
There was a pause on the other end before Samuel spoke. “Ms. Hudson, may I ask why?”
Hadn’t Patrick been helping to find Sharon?
Why would Sadie want to investigate him?
Sadie didn’t explain. “Just do as I said. Keep it discreet. No one can find out.”
“Understood, Ms. Hudson.” Though still unsure, Samuel didn’t hesitate.
Sadie ended the call and lowered the phone.
Her fingers curled around it tightly.
Then she reached out and rested her hand on her stomach—flat, quiet, and carrying a life that belonged to both her and Noah. But now, she was starting to…noveldrama
Doubt even the father of her child. Something about Sharon’s death didn’t sit right. It felt far more complicated than what Noah had told her.
And the way he reacted—it seemed too controlled, too careful.
Out in the corridor, Noah leaned against the cold wall. His head tilted back slightly; his eyes were bloodshot. He didn’t know if he had done the right thing.
Lying to Sadie. Letting her carry the weight of Sharon’s death. It felt like a dull blade carving deeper with every breath.
But he had no other choice.
Find new stories on g?lnσνs?c?m
Sadie’s situation was more dangerous than he expected.
Everything he had done—every step—was to protect her and their unborn child.
If she was safe, that was enough. Nothing else mattered.
Just then, Jack approached and lowered his voice. “Mr. Noel, the body’s been moved to the hospital morgue. The coroner has been notified, and the death certificate will be ready soon. Cremation is set for tonight.”
Noah opened his eyes slowly.
He gave a faint nod, his voice rough. “Good. Make sure everything goes smoothly. No mistakes.” Then he stood straight and turned. His eyes darkened. “After this, look into a group called Wolfpack. I want everything. Keep it quiet. No one can know what we’re doing—especially not them.”
Jack stiffened at the name. The weight behind Noah’s words was clear. “Yes, Mr. Noel. I understand.” Without another word, he left.
Noah sank onto the nearest bench. The smell of disinfectant clung to the air, thick and sharp, dragging down his already heavy thoughts.

###Chapter 1074:
Not long after, his phone rang.noveldrama
It was Hailey.
His frown deepened. Annoyance flickered in his eyes.
He ended the call without hesitation.
But the ringing came again. Relentless.
It was like she wouldn’t stop until he picked up.
His jaw tightened. His patience was gone.
He finally swiped to answer. His voice came out cold. “What the hell do you want?”
Desperation crackled through Hailey’s voice from the other end of the line. “Noah, something terrible has happened. My dad collapsed without warning. I’m terrified.”
Noah’s brows furrowed as her words registered. Not a single syllable of Hailey’s story seemed true to him. What scheme was she orchestrating now?
When Hailey sensed his hesitation, her voice dissolved into desperate pleas. “Noah, I know we can’t return to what we had, but remember how my dad always embraced you as his son. With this pregnancy, I need your support now more than ever. Please, Noah—save my father. I’m completely lost without your help.”
Her words cascaded forth, drenched in emotion and apparent anguish. An outside observer would surely believe Forest teetered at death’s door.
A shadow passed across Noah’s gaze, his eyes darkening with contemplation. In the past three years, Forest had shown Noah genuine regard, consistently valuing his perspective and input. Yet that warmth had hinged entirely on his identity as Patrick—and the advantages he delivered to the Burgess Group.
Suspicion clouded his judgment as memories collided with present instincts.
?  : g?ν﹐
After a moment’s deliberation, he relented. “I’m on my way.”
The line went dead as he ended the call.
Across town in the sprawling suburban villa, Hailey’s features betrayed none of the distress she’d just performed. A calculating smile of victory twisted her lips as she lowered the phone. She cast a sideways glance at her father, Forest, who reclined comfortably on the sofa, savoring his coffee without a hint of illness.
“Dad, have you confirmed all the arrangements? We can’t afford any mistakes.”
With deliberate precision, Forest placed his cup on the side table, his expression radiating calculated malice. Rising unhurriedly to his feet, he squeezed his daughter’s shoulder reassuringly. “Everything is in place, don’t worry. Dr. Lawson has quietly entered the country. Soon Noah will belong entirely to us—Sadie will become nothing but a forgotten memory!”
Hailey gave a slight nod, drawing strength from her father’s unwavering confidence.
Noah had subjected her to merciless cruelty, choosing time and again to humiliate her in favor of that insufferable Sadie. If compassion was absent from his heart, she would respond in kind. He’d driven her to these desperate measures through his own callousness.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1075:
Nearly thirty minutes later, the crunch of tires on gravel announced Noah’s arrival.noveldrama
Hailey burst from the living room the instant he appeared at the door. “Noah!” She latched onto his waist with desperate fingers, as though he represented her sole stability. “I’m terrified about my father…” Her words emerged strangled, as convincing tremors rippled through her body, a masterful portrayal of fear.
Noah maintained his icy composure, unmoved by her apparent distress. His frigid gaze swept the living room, registering Forest’s conspicuous absence.
As words formed on his lips, blinding pain exploded across the back of his skull, the impact of something substantial connecting with devastating force. Darkness swallowed his consciousness as the crushing realization dawned—he’d walked straight into a trap!
His legs buckled beneath him as his body crumpled helplessly onto the unforgiving floor with a sickening thud.
Genuine shock flashed across Hailey’s features at the violence of the attack. Her alarmed gaze darted to Forest, who loomed behind Noah’s fallen form, clutching a jagged shard of a porcelain vase. Glittering fragments of the shattered vase littered the floor, silent witnesses to the brutality of the strike.
“Dad!” Hailey dropped to her knees beside Noah, fingers frantically checking for signs of life.
Relief softened her features as she detected the shallow rise and fall of his chest beneath her palm.
“You struck him with excessive force!” she blurted, unable to contain her concern. “If Noah suffers permanent damage, how will we manage the repercussions?”
The customary caution that typically governed Forest’s demeanor had vanished completely. Contempt twisted his features as he gazed down at Noah’s unconscious form, prodding the limp arm with the toe of his polished shoe. “Hmph! The mighty Noah…”
Lies utterly defenseless now, conquered beneath my feet!” He retracted his foot and lifted his gaze toward Hailey, irritation flickering across his face. “Your sentimentality weakens you, Hailey! Remember what drives our actions—the restoration of the Burgess family, your rightful position of wealth and influence! Don’t you yearn to continue living the comfortable life as the Burgess family’s heiress and have our family return to its former glory?”
g α? ησ ν ?s?com takes you away
His harsh rebuke crashed over Hailey like an icy deluge, snapping her back to their ruthless reality.
Time seemed to suspend momentarily as she gathered herself and rose deliberately from her crouched position. The undeniable truth in Forest’s words crystallized in her mind. Sentimentality would only obscure her purpose. Nothing endured except family prestige and the power she seized with her own hands. Resolve hardened her gaze as the final flicker of doubt extinguished.
“Dad, my path is clear now. I’m committed to your strategy.”
Forest’s lips curved into a satisfied smirk as he witnessed her resolve solidify. He moved closer, placing an approving hand on her shoulder with unexpected gentleness. “That’s my girl. Have faith—when our work is complete, Noah will remain your husband, and the entire Wall family’s fortune will inevitably fall into your grasp.”

###Chapter 1076:
Samuel rushed to the hospital, his footsteps echoing through the sterile corridors. He thrust open Sadie’s hospital room door and spotted her by the window, her back turned to him. The sight of her fragile silhouette against the harsh daylight made his heart constrict.
“Ms. Hudson,” Samuel murmured, his voice barely disturbing the room’s stillness.
Sadie pivoted toward him with deliberate slowness. Despite her ashen complexion and bloodshot eyes, an eerie composure resided in her gaze. “Did you find anything?”
Samuel nodded and extended the folder clutched in his grip. “Ms. Hudson, this contains Mr. Noel’s and his assistant Jack’s movements after they left the hospital.”
Sadie stretched out her hand to accept the file, her fingertips brushing against his with an unsettling coldness. She cast her gaze downward and thumbed through the pages with swift precision.
“Noah went to Castro Manor?”
Her fine brows knitted together as she lifted her questioning eyes to meet Samuel’s attentive gaze. Why would Noah visit Castro Manor? And at such a crucial time, immediately following Sharon’s disappearance?
Samuel acknowledged her inquiry with a nod and proceeded with his findings. “Yes, Mr. Noel drove directly to Castro Manor. Our team confirmed Mr. Blaine Castro’s presence as well. The two appeared to engage in some sort of confrontation before both retreated inside the manor and stayed for approximately an hour. As for what they discussed, the Castro family’s staff refused to reveal a single thing.” Samuel drummed his fingers against his thigh before continuing, “There’s more—Mr. Ralph Castro landed on domestic soil last night without any forewarning.”
A shadow of deeper bewilderment crossed Sadie’s features at this revelation.
“Ralph?”
? : gν?
Hadn’t Ralph traveled overseas citing health concerns? He’d claimed to need recovery time away from everything.
What prompted this abrupt return?
Why now?
The timing reeked of something beyond mere coincidence.
Could Ralph’s unexpected return somehow connect to Sharon’s death? Sadie forced down the maelstrom of suspicions churning within her mind, sat down on the bed, and returned her attention to the document. Noah’s assistant, Jack, went to a funeral home?
Catching Sadie’s widened eyes at this detail, Samuel promptly elaborated, “Yes, Jack proceeded directly to the funeral home on the city’s periphery after departing Castro Manor. This represents the extent of our discoveries thus far. Our investigation has yielded nothing further.”
A thread of resignation wove through Samuel’s otherwise professional tone. He faltered briefly, then leaned closer, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “And one final matter, Ms. Hudson—they’ve scheduled Sharon’s cremation to occur within the hour.”
What?!
The statement struck Sadie like a physical blow, the words reverberating through her skull with brutal clarity.

###Chapter 1077:
Her head snapped upward, color fleeing from her face as her eyes expanded with raw shock and utter disbelief.
Cremation? Already?
With Sharon’s cause of death shrouded in mystery and her killer still at large, how could anyone authorize such a hasty cremation?!
The entire situation defied logic!
Unless…
Unless someone desperately needed to obliterate evidence!
Sadie’s thoughts accelerated wildly as connections formed between these disparate elements.
Noah’s peculiar conduct, the Castro family’s entanglement, Ralph’s abrupt return, and now this suspiciously expedited cremation… A bone-chilling realization crystallized within her consciousness. Noah concealed something crucial—Sadie felt this certainty with every fiber of her being!
And perhaps Sharon’s supposed “death” masked something far more sinister!
Sadie’s heart clenched painfully within her chest.
She drew in a deep, steadying breath, commanding her racing thoughts to order.
No, inaction was not an option she could afford.
She bolted upright from the hospital bed with sudden determination.
The abrupt motion sent the room tilting momentarily around her.
“Ms. Hudson!” Samuel lurched forward, arms outstretched to prevent her collapse.

Sadie dismissed his concern with a flick of her wrist and regained her footing. “I’m alright.” Her gaze hardened with steely resolve as she met Samuel’s concerned expression. “Let’s go. We need to reach that funeral home. I must examine the body myself!”
Nothing would stop her from seeing the truth with her own eyes!
Samuel studied her ashen yet unwavering countenance and nodded his head. “Yes, Ms. Hudson.”
Sadie advanced a single step before freezing in place, struck by a sudden recollection.
She pivoted back toward Samuel, her expression deceptively composed while her eyes gleamed with intensity. “Samuel, investigate Faron Retreat for me. Determine its current ownership, then acquire it by whatever means necessary.”noveldrama
Faron Retreat…
The final residence of Sadie’s parents before their deaths five years prior.
Despite the passage of time, Sadie couldn’t dispel her instinct that vital secrets remained concealed within those grounds.
Samuel couldn’t fathom why his boss abruptly sought to acquire what appeared to be an insignificant parcel of land, yet he responded without hesitation, “Understood, Ms. Hudson. Consider it done.”

###Chapter 1078:
“I’ll direct the legal department to handle this matter without delay,” Samuel assured, his voice resonating with quiet efficiency.
Sadie and Samuel departed in a rush of gravel and tires, the sleek vehicle gliding through traffic until the stark silhouette of the suburban funeral home materialized before them.
The funeral home’s entrance enveloped them in a cloak of undisturbed stillness, its weathered facade exuding an almost palpable sadness that hung in the air like morning mist.
Sadie’s polished heel had barely touched the pavement when her gaze locked onto a familiar silhouette lingering beside the ornate entrance doors.
Jack slouched against the doorframe, his chin repeatedly dipping toward his chest as exhaustion threatened to claim him. His eyelids battled gravity’s persistent pull, while his entire frame wavered precariously, resembling a sapling in unpredictable wind.
What possible business could have brought him here?
Sadie’s forehead creased with suspicion as she advanced toward his unstable figure, her footsteps deliberate and measured. “Jack?” Her voice sliced through the cemetery-like silence, its crystalline coolness shattering the somber atmosphere.
Jack catapulted into consciousness, his spine straightening with such violent suddenness that he might have been subjected to an electric current.
Recognition dawned in his bleary eyes as they focused on Sadie’s approaching form, and the fog of exhaustion evaporated instantly, giving way to unmistakable terror.
Noah’s stern admonitions echoed through his mind—Sadie must remain ignorant of the truth at all costs. Yet here she stood before him, her presence as unexpected as it was catastrophic.
Jack’s cardiac rhythm faltered momentarily before accelerating to a gallop. He lunged forward with desperate urgency, extending his arms across the entrance like a human barricade against Sadie’s advance.
More ? ? g?ν
“Ms. Hudson? What… what circumstances have brought you to this establishment?” His voice quavered, each syllable dripping with poorly concealed distress.noveldrama
“This establishment radiates an unsettling atmosphere,” he continued, words tumbling over one another. “Given your ongoing recovery, venturing inside would be ill-advised. I-I’ll ensure the ashes reach you personally once the procedure concludes. Might that arrangement prove suitable?”
Sadie scrutinized his agitated countenance and transparent ploy to redirect her elsewhere, feeling her suspicions burrow deeper into the bedrock of her consciousness.
She deflected his outstretched arm with gentle determination. “Your concern is unnecessary. Sharon tended to my parents with unwavering dedication. She was like family. Paying my respects represents the barest minimum of what her memory deserves.”
Her resolute declaration triggered an immediate physiological response as frigid perspiration materialized across Jack’s forehead, glistening under the harsh fluorescent lighting.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1079:
Pay respects? Should Sadie’s eyes fall upon the corpse within—a body bearing no connection whatsoever to Sharon—the resulting catastrophe would be immeasurable!
With Noah beyond communication’s reach, Jack floundered in a momentary abyss of indecision, options evaporating before they could fully materialize in his panicked mind.
Anxiety radiated through him like electricity through a conductor, yet he maintained his obstructive stance with desperate determination. “Ms. Hudson, this… this might not be a wise decision. Sharon suffered severe injuries before she passed. Her remains… they exhibit extensive damage, creating a profoundly disturbing impression. The visual impact verges on horrifying. Sparing yourself such distress would be prudent—particularly considering potential effects on your unborn child.”
Sadie’s eyebrows converged into a formidable knot while her gaze transformed into a penetrating blade directed squarely at Jack’s increasingly ashen face. “Sharon occupies the sacred space of family in my heart. Such concerns hold no power over my resolve.”
Her unflinching scrutiny sent glacial tendrils cascading down Jack’s vertebral column while the accumulated moisture on his brow surrendered to gravity, trailing conspicuous rivulets down his temples. His jaw slackened as his frantic mind rummaged desperately through its depleted inventory of plausible justifications.
“What precise information are you attempting to conceal?” Sadie’s tone crystallized into arctic severity, interwoven with unmistakable threads of mounting impatience and deepening suspicion. “Does something exist within these walls that you’re desperate to shield from my observation?”
Jack’s heart plummeted into the depths of his abdomen. His head oscillated in frantic denial, a metronome marking panic’s tempo. “No, no! Nothing of the sort! Your interpretation is entirely mistaken, Ms. Hudson. I merely…”noveldrama
Sadie’s reservoir of tolerance for his incoherent sputtering had evaporated completely.
L?t?st chαpt?rs ιn glovе.?
She pivoted her head toward Samuel, transmitting an unmistakable directive through her penetrating gaze alone.
Samuel deciphered her silent command instantaneously. He advanced with purposeful strides, establishing an intimidating barrier between Jack and freedom. “Jack, Ms. Hudson desires nothing more than visual confirmation. What motivates your persistent obstruction?”
Seizing the strategic opportunity, Sadie executed a nimble lateral maneuver around Jack’s distracted form, disregarding his desperate ions as she glided purposefully into the funeral home’s somber interior.
“Samuel! Release me immediately!” Jack’s voice crescendoed in anguished supplication as he witnessed Sadie’s silhouette vanish beyond the threshold into forbidden territory.
He thrashed against Samuel’s unyielding grip, but the larger man remained immovable, projecting tranquil authority. “Jack, I implore you to regain your composure. Wouldn’t transparency with Ms. Hudson prove ultimately beneficial?”
Jack’s frantic gaze ricocheted between Samuel’s inscrutable professional demeanor and the ominous corridor that had swallowed Sadie’s retreating form. His heart plummeted to unprecedented depths of despair.
The certainty of his impending catastrophic fate crystallized in his consciousness with brutal clarity.

###Chapter 1080:
Should Noah discover this breach, his corporeal punishment would transcend mere metaphorical expression!
The moment Sadie’s silhouette dissolved completely into the corridor’s murky distance, Samuel relinquished his vice-like restraint on Jack’s trembling form.
With a perfunctory adjustment of his impeccable suit jacket, Samuel hastened after his employer’s determined trajectory.
Jack, consumed by unmitigated terror, propelled himself forward with reckless velocity in desperate pursuit of the retreating pair.
Sadie’s fingertips had barely grazed the morgue’s institutional doorknob when the door swung inward, revealing a staff member in clinical white attire. “Might you be Ms. Hudson?” The attendant consulted the documentation clutched in his latex-gloved hand before elevating his gaze to meet Sadie’s expectant countenance, his features arranged in professional regret. “I regret to inform you that your arrival has transpired moments too late. The remains you sought were transferred to our cremation facility precisely five minutes before your appearance.”
What?
Sadie froze mid-motion, becoming a living statue as shadows of horrified realization eclipsed her features with alarming rapidity.
It was already subjected to irreversible incineration?
What inconceivable circumstances could possibly explain such extraordinary procedural acceleration?
Positioned in her peripheral shadow, Jack expelled a gossamer breath of profound liberation upon absorbing the fortuitous announcement. Providence had smiled upon their desperate gambit, ensuring their timely intervention.
The critical ive had been achieved—Sadie’s eyes remained mercifully uncontaminated by forbidden revelations.

Sadie slowly clenched her fingers until her nails dug into her palms. She did her best to quell the turmoil inside her heart and forced herself to appear calm and composed. Then, she pulled out a photograph from her purse and handed it to the staff member. It was a picture of Sharon, her usual kind, gentle smile lighting up her face.
“Have you seen this person?” Sadie asked.
The staff member took the photo and peered at it for a moment before shaking his head. “I’m sorry, Ms. Hudson. I’ve never seen her.” His expression was a mix of confusion and sympathy as he handed the photo back to her. “May I ask who she is?”
Sadie’s expression turned icy, her gaze piercing. “Exactly who did you just send into the cremation chamber? The person in this photo is the deceased, Sharon Buckley!”noveldrama
The man froze at her words, his eyes widening in disbelief. He looked at the photo again, then back at Sadie. “No, that’s not possible!” he cried out, sounding utterly shocked. “We verified the details before we carried out the process… Everything was in order!”
Jack could practically feel the color drain from his face. His legs felt numb, and his mind was slowly going blank. He felt his stomach drop, as if a huge chasm had opened beneath him, and he was now falling into it.

###Chapter 1081:
He couldn’t bring himself to imagine it, but he was fairly sure that a gruesome fate awaited him in the hands of his boss.
As if sensing his panic, Samuel cast a sympathetic glance at him. This was bound to happen the moment Jack decided to withhold the truth. Sadie had whipped around at some point and was now glaring at Jack. Although she said nothing, he could feel the overwhelming pressure coming from her direction.
Jack shuddered in fright and gave in to his survival instincts by shifting the blame away from himself.
“Ms. Hudson…” he sputtered in a trembling voice. “This—this was all Mr. Noel’s idea! I just—I was just following his orders…”
Sadie had long since lost her patience. She cut him off with a derisive snort, then turned away and strode out of the funeral home. Jack and Samuel exchanged a look before hurrying after her.
Jack broke out in a cold sweat when he noticed the angry resolve in Sadie’s stride. He hastened his pace to catch up to her, then stepped in front of her to block her path. “Ms. Hudson, please let me explain!” Jack said desperately, his tone and expression pleading. “Mr. Noel truly cares about you! Please never doubt that. He has his own reasons for doing this—please don’t misunderstand his intentions.”
His boss had gone to great lengths to keep this matter under wraps, all to protect Sadie. He couldn’t just stand by and let her misunderstand his boss’s good intentions. Besides, if his boss found out that he had not only botched the job, but had also made him look bad in front of Sadie, the consequences would be very dire indeed.noveldrama
Sadie paused in her tracks and slowly raised her eyes to meet Jack’s.
“Reasons?” She let out a mocking laugh, and her next words were laced with sarcasm and disappointment. “He told me Sharon is dead, then used an unidentified corpse to further the deception. Did I misunderstand that, Jack?”
Continue reading on g?νc?
Her tone wasn’t particularly sharp, but every word that came out of her mouth stung.
Jack’s throat worked, but no sound came out. His face alternated between pale and flushed. He knew that no matter what he said now, it would just sound like a hollow excuse.
Sadie took a deep breath and shifted her gaze to somewhere past him. She told herself to stay calm. It wasn’t the time to dwell on something like this. Her priority was finding Noah and getting answers, once and for all.
“Where is your boss right now?” she asked in that same icy voice.
The question caught Jack off-guard. He had been so focused on making sure everything at the funeral home went well that he hadn’t kept track of his boss’s whereabouts. He shook his head, his brows furrowed in confusion. “I—I don’t know… Mr. Noel instructed me to stay here. He was supposed to keep you company at the hospital…”
Sadie’s eyes flickered. She turned to look at Samuel, and a silent question passed between them.
Samuel gave her a slight shake of the head.
The hallways had been empty when they left the hospital. There had been no sign of Noah.
.

###Chapter 1082:
So, where was he? How could he just disappear without a trace? Jack felt yet another knot of dread in his chest when he realized the gravity of the situation.
He fumbled for his phone and called Noah’s number.
It rang and rang, until the line went dead. No answer.
Why wasn’t he picking up? Where had his boss gone?
Jack’s breathing grew heavy as he gripped his phone in his shaking hand.
When he looked up at Sadie, his face betrayed the fear and panic that had overwhelmed him. “He—He isn’t answering.”
Sadie’s breath caught in her throat.
She blinked and tried to remain calm. “Perhaps he was tired and decided to go home and rest instead.”
She wasn’t convinced that was the case, though, even as she said the words out loud.
Knowing Noah, there was no way he would leave her alone at a time like this.
Sadie said no more. She turned on her heel and walked briskly to the Maybach parked by the road.
Samuel and Jack exchanged another look, this time filled with trepidation, before following her.
Samuel slid into the driver’s seat, while Jack took the passenger seat.noveldrama
The engine hummed to life as they merged onto the highway and drove off.
A stifling silence blanketed the car, so thick it seemed to steal the very air from its three occupants’ lungs.
Thirty minutes later, the sleek black Maybach glided through the wrought-iron gates of Autumn Garden Villa.
  : [?]
Sadie was the first to move, pushing the door open and stepping out into the quiet night.
The villa stood bathed in warm light—but an unsettling hush clung to it, unnatural and cold.
She rushed into the living room, eyes darting anxiously across the space.
It was deserted. Completely, hauntingly empty.
Refusing to give in to despair, Sadie bolted upstairs, flinging open the master bedroom door. Empty.
She tore through the study, the guest rooms—searching every corner of the villa as if willing Noah to appear.
But there was not even a trace of him.
He hadn’t come home.
Back in the vast, hollow living room, she stood frozen. A chill crept up from the floorboards, slicing through her like ice.
Where could he have gone?
.
.
.
###Chapter 1083:noveldrama
He wasn’t answering his phone, wasn’t at the hospital, and hadn’t returned home.
Then, like a lightning strike, a name surged into her mind—unbidden,
Jan-Ing.
Hailey.
Noah’s wife—at least, in name.
And she was pregnant now.
Could he have… gone to her?
Perhaps, that was why she had called him earlier?
The moment the thought took root, it wrapped around Sadie’s chest like thorny vines, squeezing tighter with every breath.
Sadie’s eyes lost their light, dimming as the realization settled over her.
Her lips curled into a bitter smile.
How could she forget?
Noah belonged to Hailey now. It was her he was bound to, her he had to protect.
Sadie drew in a shaky breath, swallowing the bitterness rising in her throat.
“Forget about it,” she murmured, turning away. Her voice, soft and frayed at the edges, carried the weight of quiet defeat. “Let’s just go back.”
Maybe Noah was just tired and needed rest.
Maybe he had gone to Hailey.
Whatever the truth was, it didn’t matter—he was gone, and she had no way to reach him now.
Read it all on g?lnσνs?com
Behind her, Jack watched as she turned to leave, her shoulders sagging beneath invisible weight, and panic surged through him.
He darted forward, stepping in her path.
“Ms. Hudson—please, wait!”
The emptiness in Sadie’s eyes struck him like a blow. His throat tightened.
“You’re wrong about Mr. Noel!” he burst out, unable to hold it in. “He… he filed for divorce from Ms. Burgess ages ago! She just wouldn’t sign the papers—she’s been clinging to him with every trick in the book!”
Jack’s words tumbled out, frantic and breathless.
“I swear, on everything I’ve got—Mr. Noel and Ms. Burgess never even shared a bed! Their marriage wasn’t real. It was just a business move to keep Burgess Group afloat. She played on a favor he owed her, and he had no choice but to go along with it!”
He poured out the truth in one unbroken rush.
Sadie’s brows drew together ever so slightly, her expression laced with unspoken questions.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1084:
Hailey exploited a favor? What on earth did that mean? An old story. One she clearly hadn’t been told.
She wrestled the storm inside her, trying to calm down as she leveled her gaze at Jack.
“Explain,” she said evenly, though her tone carried a sharp undercurrent. “What do you mean by ‘a favor’?”
Jack caught the flicker of curiosity in her eyes and latched onto it as if it were his last hope.
He looked as though he might pledge himself right then and there.
“Ms. Hudson, I swear—on my honor, on my life!” he said, his voice trembling with urgency. “Mr. Noel’s feelings for you are absolutely genuine. He has never, not once, wavered. As for Ms. Burgess—he only agreed to that sham of a marriage because she once saved his life. That’s it. There’s no love there, no intimacy—never has been! It was just a business deal to stabilize the Burgess Group.”
Jack’s voice cracked with intensity. He looked as though he might drop to his knees at any second, eyes pleading with Sadie to believe.
“All he’s ever wanted is you. And now he’s disappeared, without a word? That’s not him! Please, Ms. Hudson—doesn’t that tell you something’s wrong?”
Jack’s desperation pounded in Sadie’s ears.
“Ms. Hudson, please think about it!” Jack urged, his voice cracking under the weight of his fear. “You know how much Mr. Noel treasures you—do you really believe he’d just walk out of that hospital without a word? No… something’s wrong. Something had to have happened.”
The more he spoke, the faster his heart pounded—each beat laced with growing dread.
Sadie stood perfectly still, fists clenched so tightly her knuckles had blanched.
C t glov?ls.○
She didn’t respond, but her silence spoke louder than any words. Her lashes quivered ever so slightly, and her lips were drawn into a tight, brittle line. She was barely holding together the storm inside her. She knew. She had always known Noah cared about her. Deeply. Fiercely.
Sharon’s “death” had shattered what little composure Sadie had left, and when compounded by the pile of Noah’s lies, it sent her spiraling into a storm of obsessive thoughts she couldn’t escape.noveldrama
Years spent at her side had made Samuel the person most attuned to her moods. No one read her like he did.
The moment her features shifted, even slightly, he caught it. Without waiting for her to say a word, he slipped out the door, already preparing to dispatch people to trace Noah’s location.
Meanwhile, Sadie sank onto the living room sofa, her energy completely drained.
Her thoughts were in chaos. Jack’s earlier revelations kept replaying in her mind. What if something had actually happened to Noah?
No. That couldn’t be.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1085:
Noah was resourceful. He was always five steps ahead. Someone like him didn’t just disappear.
He had to be okay. He would be okay.
She repeated those words like a mantra, clinging to them as if they could will her fears away. Still, her nerves refused to settle.
Every tick of the clock seemed louder than the last. Time crawled, each second dragging its feet.
She couldn’t say how long she’d been sitting there when the sound of fast-approaching footsteps jolted her back to the moment.
Samuel burst in, breathless and sweating, his face pale and voice strained with panic. “Ms. Hudson—something’s wrong! I tracked the last IP pinged from Mr. Noel’s phone. It’s at… Ultracare Hospital!”
Ultracare Hospital?
The name alone jolted Sadie upright, the blood draining from her face in an instant.
Of all places, why would Noah end up there?
Reputation alone made it clear—Ultracare was never a destination of choice. People didn’t go there unless something was seriously wrong. A sickening weight settled in her chest, thick with dread and frustration.
Across the room, Samuel caught the fear spreading across her face and didn’t dare waste another breath. “There’s more. According to the surveillance our team pulled, Hailey and her father, Forest, were spotted at the hospital too.”
As soon as the words left his mouth, Jack’s expression shifted violently, as if a puzzle piece had just snapped into place.
His voice cracked with alarm. “Wait—what if Hailey… She couldn’t get Mr. Noel, so she’s resorting to extreme measures…”
   g?ν
Of all people, Hailey was capable of anything, and that possibility made Jack’s skin crawl.
The more he thought about it, the harder it became to breathe. He couldn’t even finish the thought.
But Sadie didn’t wait to hear the rest. She was gone before anyone could stop her, bursting through the door like a sudden gust of wind. Jack and Samuel shared a look that said everything. Without a second’s hesitation, both of them sprinted after her.
The car tore down the road, slicing through the night like an arrow loosed from a taut string.
Brakes shrieked at the hospital entrance as the vehicle jerked to a sudden stop.
Without hesitation, Sadie threw the door open and sprinted toward the building.
Steel-framed glass doors loomed ahead, locked tight. In front of them stood two security guards in crisp uniforms, their faces unreadable. She went straight for the entrance, only to be stopped short as one guard stepped into her path, arm outstretched. “Apologies, ma’am. No visitors or patients allowed today.”
His eyes swept over her, and though his voice remained courteous, the finality in it was unmistakable. “If it’s a medical issue, I recommend you try another facility.”noveldrama
.
.
.
###Chapter 1086:
But Sadie barely registered the words. Her pulse thundered in her ears. All she could see was the growing nightmare in her head—Noah, hurt or worse, just beyond those doors. “Out of my way! This is an emergency!”
The panic in her voice crackled through the air.
Everything inside her screamed for movement. There wasn’t a second to spare.
The moment the guard’s gaze shifted slightly, she lunged sideways, hoping to slip past him.
But he was faster. His arm shot out again, barring her with more force this time.
Annoyance edged into his tone now, the mask of polite professionalism beginning to slip.
He couldn’t help but grumble inwardly—this woman looked well put together, but clearly had no concept of following protocol.
Trying to keep things civil, the second guard offered a polite but firm warning, saying, “Ma’am, we’re just following procedure. Please don’t make it harder for us. Forcing your way in won’t solve anything—it’ll just get us in trouble.”
None of that mattered to Sadie.
Each breath she drew came sharp and ragged, panic flaring in her eyes. “If something happens to Noah,” she said in a low, cutting voice, “this hospital won’t be operating for much longer!”
Though she didn’t shout, the weight behind her voice left no room for argument.
Something in her presence made the guard freeze, momentarily thrown off balance, unsure how to handle her.
It became instantly obvious—this woman wasn’t here for medical assistance. She was here to cause trouble.
?  : g?ν
His fingers moved toward his phone. He was intent on calling for reinforcements.
But Samuel caught the motion at once, a flicker of steel entering his gaze. Before the man could speak, Samuel stepped in and struck with swift, practiced precision.
The sound of impact was heavy and final, followed by the thud of a body hitting the ground.
Panic crept into the second guard’s expression. His partner down, he instinctively backed away, face drained of all color.
With nothing standing in her way now, Sadie barreled through the entrance, Jack close behind her.noveldrama
Inside, the hospital felt like a ghost town—quieter than expected, the stillness broken only by the sharp echo of their footsteps.
When they saw the nurses’ station, Sadie strode up to the desk. “Where is Noah?” she asked, her voice slicing through the silence like glass.
The nurse was bent over the desk, arranging supplies, when a sudden voice broke the silence, startling her.
She shot upright, and as her eyes met Sadie’s, her pupils narrowed in alarm.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1087:
Sadie? What was she doing here? With that cold fire in her expression, the nurse could almost feel the animosity radiating from her.noveldrama
Her grip faltered, and the pen slipped from her fingers, clattering to the floor. A tremor ran through her as she shakily raised her arm, pointing toward the corridor’s end. Her voice quivered. “D-down there… the surgery room…”
Without a word, Sadie turned and walked away.
Jack and Samuel followed, keeping a steady pace just behind her.
Their steps were quick, and it didn’t take long before they reached the surgical suite.
Outside the sealed entryway, Hailey sat on a bench, looking completely unfazed. A subtle, unreadable smile curled at her lips. She didn’t look like someone concerned about her spouse’s condition.
Sadie’s simmering rage snapped the moment her gaze landed on Hailey. She stormed forward, grabbed Hailey by the front of her blouse, and yanked her upright.
The motion was abrupt and forceful, leaving Hailey stunned and motionless.
“Hailey! What sick game are you playing? Where is Noah?” Sadie shouted, her voice breaking with barely contained fury, her eyes blazing with rage.
Hailey, initially taken aback by the sudden aggression, quickly regained her composure.
Why was Sadie always showing up like this? An unwelcome shadow that never seemed to fade.
Hailey’s lashes fluttered down slightly, masking her thoughts. She couldn’t afford to let Sadie interfere now.
Feigning innocence, she furrowed her brow and gave Sadie a look of hurt confusion.
 сαρ g﹒
She turned away, refusing to meet Sadie’s burning gaze. “Ms. Hudson, I have no idea what you’re implying,” she murmured. “But barging into a medical facility with your helpers and attacking someone in public? Hardly acceptable behavior, don’t you think?”
She paused deliberately, then added with a venom-laced smirk, “After all, I am Noah’s wife now.”
Those words were like sparks to dry kindling, igniting Sadie’s fury into an inferno.
Her whole body trembled, but her lips twisted into a cold sneer.
“You dare call yourself his wife?”
She locked eyes with Hailey, her voice sharp and deliberate. “The only lawful spouse Noah has—on paper and in truth—is me. And you…” Her eyes traveled over Hailey with revulsion. “You’re just a parasite, hoping to claim what isn’t yours.”
As if struck by a sudden thought, Sadie arched an eyebrow and let a sly grin curve her lips. “Oh—hold on. That’s not quite the whole truth, is it? If memory serves me right, Ms. Burgess, didn’t you marry that scandalous Noel family’s illegitimate member? Moved on so fast you forgot you’re still legally bound to someone else?”
Hailey’s complexion paled in an instant.
She hadn’t expected Sadie to know that detail.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1088:
Each word from Sadie’s mouth cut deep, like shards of glass embedding themselves into her chest, leaving her speechless. She bit down on her lower lip, but no defense came.
Sadie didn’t feel pacified by Hailey’s crushed demeanor. The fire inside her refused to be extinguished.
She’d had enough. “This is your final warning—where is Noah? Stay silent, and the Burgess Group won’t survive what’s coming.”
Those words triggered a reaction—though not fear. Instead, Hailey let out a low, derisive chuckle.
She lifted her chin, her eyes gleaming with twisted satisfaction. “You think I’m that easy to intimidate? Think again. I won’t flinch at your empty threats.”
With a swift motion, she yanked herself free of Sadie’s grasp, smoothed the creases in her outfit, and wore that smug expression like armor. “As for who Noah truly belongs to—we’ll let him answer that when he regains consciousness.”
Sadie’s breath hitched. An icy unease gripped her chest, a dreadful premonition spreading like frost beneath her skin.
She couldn’t shake the gnawing suspicion that something catastrophic was unfolding—or had already taken place.
Then Jack, who had been watching quietly from the sidelines, suddenly cried out, pointing toward the surgical suite, “Ms. Hudson! Mr. Noel is inside that room!” Panic laced every word.
Sadie whipped her head around, her eyes locking onto the sealed metal doors.
No. This wasn’t possible.
Why was Noah in surgery?
Uncover your next story on g ? lnσ ν s, com
Her thoughts scattered, and it felt as though a steel vice had clamped around her chest, choking the air from her lungs.
Hailey drank in Sadie’s devastated expression, her grin stretching crueler by the second.
She slowly approached Sadie, leaning in close to whisper in a voice only the two of them could hear, “Sadie, you’re already too late. Once Noah wakes, you’ll be erased. He’ll have no recollection of you. His memories—gone. And the only woman he’ll recognize as his wife… will be me. So do yourself a favor—walk away.”
Sadie’s pulse thundered in her ears.
Hailey’s cryptic threat struck a nerve—and then it clicked.
She had seen Hailey meeting with Evan not long ago.
Wasn’t that about making sure Noah would never regain his memories? Could it be…?
Sadie burned with fury, her glare sharp enough to cut through glass as she imagined tearing the smug satisfaction off Hailey’s face. Her breath came in ragged bursts, and when she finally spoke, her voice cracked through the tension like a whip. “How could you treat—Noah this way? Doesn’t he mean anything to you?!”
A sudden, scornful laugh burst from Hailey’s lips—loud and dripping with cruelty, as though she’d just heard a child say something naive.
With an expression dripping with contempt, Hailey tilted her head and gave Sadie a once-over, as if she were something pitiful and beneath notice.
“You’ve got no right to come at me,” Hailey said, her voice cold as steel. “I tried so hard to drag Noah back from death three years ago. And what did I get in return?”
.

###Chapter 1089:
Her words were intentional, calculated to wound. “If anyone’s to blame here, it’s you. You took what wasn’t yours, Sadie. You stole my husband. So don’t stand there pretending to be the victim—you earned every bit of this.”
Sadie couldn’t keep it in any longer.
Then a sharp slap struck Hailey’s face, snapping her head to the side and leaving five clear finger marks blazing on her cheek.
Still burning with fury, Sadie grabbed Hailey by the collar and flung her aside like a discarded piece of fabric.
Thrown off balance, Hailey stumbled backward, barely managing to stay upright.noveldrama
Without missing a beat, Jack stepped in and seized Hailey’s arms, locking her in place before she could recover.
At that moment, Samuel pushed through the corridor doors, flanked by a squad of towering bodyguards, having cleared out the guards stationed outside.
An oppressive weight settled over the corridor, thickening the air with tension.
Sadie didn’t even glance at the disheveled Hailey. Her eyes stayed locked on the tightly closed doors of the operating room.
“Force those doors open. Lock down every wing of this hospital. I don’t want a single soul slipping through,” she instructed, her voice sharp as frostbite.
A shiver crawled up Samuel’s spine, and he nodded at once. “Understood, Ms. Hudson.”
He raised a hand, and the bodyguards sprang into action. A few surged toward the operating room, while the rest scattered to secure the exits.
Panic shot through Hailey as Jack held her back.
?  ? ν
Her face went pale, all trace of smugness and calm wiped clean.
Thrashing in Jack’s grip, she fought like a trapped animal, her voice rising into hysteria. “Sadie! What the hell are you doing?! Are you trying to ruin the surgery? Do you want Noah to die?!”
Terror surged through Hailey’s veins. She had woven this plan with painstaking care—failure was not an option now.
Turning with deliberate slowness, Sadie fixed her cold stare on Hailey, locking eyes with a face twisted in panic.
A cruel grin tugged at the corner of her lips. “You’re in no position to lecture me. If Noah wants to erase something from his life, that’s his choice. But you?” Her voice dropped. “You don’t matter enough to decide anything.”
While the words still lingered in the air, Samuel had already raised his arm, signaling the bodyguards. A heavy pounding slammed against the operating room doors.
“Bang!”
The blunt, jarring impact echoed like thunder through the corridor, slicing through the silence and tightening every chest in the hallway.
Drawn by the noise, a few doctors and nurses cautiously peered out from behind doors and around corners, their faces marked with confusion and unease.
None of them dared to step forward. Faced with Sadie’s entourage exuding such heavy authority, they chose silence over confrontation.

###Chapter 1090:
Pushing his way through the gathering crowd, a man with thinning hair and gold-rimmed glasses appeared in a hurry.
His pace was frantic, enough to leave his glasses tilted and his forehead glistening with sweat—clearly, he had rushed the moment he caught wind of the disturbance.
It was none other than Dawson Landon, the Ultracare Hospital’s director.
Straining to maintain composure, Dawson forced a shaky smile that wavered at the edges. “Ms. Hudson, what a surprise. We… we deeply regret not greeting you sooner.”
While speaking, he darted nervous glances at Sadie, gauging the storm brewing in her expression. “Still, Ms. Hudson, this is a surgical zone, and what you’re doing—”
Sadie cut him off with an impatient flick of her hand and a glare sharp enough to silence any further excuses.
She wasn’t in the mood for polite scolding disguised as protocol.
Spinning on her heel, she closed the distance between herself and Dawson, whose body had already begun to tremble under the pressure. Her eyes bored into him like twin blades. “If Noah so much as loses a single strand of hair… I’ll reduce this entire hospital to ashes. Try me.”
The force of Sadie’s presence weighed down on Dawson like a collapsing ceiling—there was no room to breathe.
Not for a second did he believe she was bluffing.
“Sir.”
“You, and your team, need to handle this situation now,” Sadie ordered, her tone frigid. “Do whatever it takes to prevent that operation from continuing. I don’t care what kind of procedure it is—it must be shut down immediately.”
Dawson’s blood ran cold. His entire body stiffened, his knees buckling as if gravity had doubled its pull. He barely managed to stay upright.
Chapter updates at gln ov els.
This couldn’t be happening.
Once a procedure had begun, halting it wasn’t a simple matter. If things went sideways and Noah didn’t survive, his career as head of the facility would crumble.
Crash! The steel doors to the operating room burst inward with a deafening clang.
Sadie didn’t spare Dawson another glance. She pivoted sharply and marched inside.
Samuel and Jack trailed after her, their faces set, muscles taut with tension.
Dawson’s fear spiked. His nerves frayed, and he scrambled after them, calling out frantically, “Ms. Hudson! Please, let’s talk! I’ll find a fix—I swear! We can settle this calmly. Just give me a moment! Please, calm down and don’t do this!”
His modest facility stood no chance against a conglomerate like Wall Group.
If Noah suffered any harm here, the institution—and Dawson himself—would be ruined.
The group reached the monitoring station. Sadie cast a look so sharp it could cut steel.
Dawson understood immediately. His hands trembled as he fumbled with his ID card, swiping it across the panel.
The mechanical door gave a heavy groan as it unlatched.
Inside, beneath the harsh glare of overhead lights, a figure loomed—a man in scrubs, his face concealed except for a chilling pair of sharp, predatory eyes.
In his grip was a scalpel, its blade gleaming ominously just inches above Noah, who lay utterly still on the operating table.

###Chapter 1091:
Noah’s skin was pale, his breathing shallow. He was clearly deep under anesthesia.
Sadie’s heart dropped into her stomach. Her pupils narrowed. “Noah!” Her voice broke into a ragged cry as she darted toward him, wild with panic, hurling herself against the table where he lay. She kept shouting his name, frantic and breathless, the sound raw with grief. “Please, Noah, open your eyes!”
Just above his skull, a gleaming blade hovered—so close it could have sliced with the faintest twitch.
Another heartbeat, and the outcome would’ve been irreversible. Sadie’s pulse thrashed in her chest. Her back was soaked, her limbs quaking beneath the pressure of terror.
At that precise instant, Samuel and the guards burst in like a sudden storm.
Clad in black, the men moved like clockwork, forcing the doctor to the floor and prying the scalpel from his clenched hand.
“Let me go!” the man—Stuart Lawson—rasped, struggling against their grip.
Frozen in place, Dawson could only gape at the chaos. His eyes locked onto the unfamiliar figure—the “doctor” who had nearly altered fate—and his mind collapsed into confusion.
He lifted a trembling hand, barely able to form the words. “Who… who are you?! How did you even get in here?!”
Hearing the words, Sadie, too, was momentarily stunned.
She whipped around, her glare slicing into him. His face drained of color under the intensity of her stare. “What is going on here?!” Dawson nearly buckled under the weight of her fury.
He waved his hands with wild urgency, anguish contorting his features. His voice trembled with fear. “Ms. Hudson, you have to trust me! I’m telling the truth—this is all a terrible mix-up! That man—he doesn’t work here! I promise you, he’s not on our personnel list!” Dawson was soaked in perspiration, gripped by dread that Sadie might hold the facility liable for the chaos. “Besides, Mr. Noel was scheduled for cranial reconstruction today under the care of Dr. Farrell Adams, the top brain specialist at our institution! The documentation and procedure timetable are exact. This shouldn’t have happened!”
After he spoke, Dawson suddenly smacked his own forehead. “Wait! Dr. Adams! He called earlier—said he had an urgent family matter and needed to take the day off! This entire thing… we’ve been deceived!”
 ?  g?ν﹐
Regret overwhelmed him. If only he had questioned Farrell’s excuse more thoroughly.noveldrama
It was a setup from the start.
With a heavy thump, Dawson collapsed to the floor, facing Sadie with desperation etched into his voice. “Ms. Hudson, please—hear me out! We’ve been duped too! I’m begging you, don’t doubt our innocence!”
Sadie’s eyes moved slowly from Dawson to Stuart, still restrained by the guards.
Despite the situation, Stuart was disturbingly unruffled. His face bore no emotion, and his gaze—cold, calculating—remained locked on them without a word.
His unnatural stillness made Sadie’s skin crawl.
She turned sharply toward Samuel, her tone as sharp as ice. “Uncover that man’s identity.”
Samuel gave a slight bow. “Right away, Ms. Hudson.”
At his signal, the guards dragged the ominously silent Stuart from the operating room.
A suffocating stillness settled over the room, leaving just Sadie, Dawson, and the unconscious Noah.
Drawing a shaky breath, Sadie wrestled down the turmoil surging inside her.
She stepped closer to the bed, her eyes fixed on Noah’s colorless face. Carefully, she laid her hand against his forehead.
The chill of his skin pierced through her, tightening her chest with grief.
Looking back at Dawson, who stood quaking behind her, she asked in a broken whisper, “How long… until he regains consciousness?”
Dawson, startled by her words, felt a flicker of hope. He rushed to check Noah’s vitals.
Moments later, he exhaled deeply, and some color returned to his cheeks.

“Please rest assured, Ms. Hudson. Mr. Noel was only injected with a strong anesthetic. Although the dosage was high, the surgery was never started, so no real harm was done to his body. Once the anesthetic wears off, Mr. Noel will wake up naturally,” Dawson explained calmly.
Sadie finally felt at ease. She nodded, the tension slowly melting away from her body, only to be replaced by an overwhelming fatigue. Thankfully, Noah was all right.
Meanwhile, Hailey remained restrained by two burly bodyguards outside the operating room. She cowered in the corner, utterly defeated. She could only watch as Samuel led his team, escorting the tightly bound Stuart out of the operating room.
How did things turn out this way? Had her plan failed? Hailey felt the color drain from her face as her knees buckled beneath her.
No… it couldn’t be!
Stuart had assured her the plan was foolproof! Besides, she had gone to such great lengths, made so many sacrifices, and risked everything she had… How could she have failed?
A chill raced through her spine, surging to her toes and the top of her head. She felt cold all over. It was all ruined now—completely ruined.
Once Noah woke up, it wouldn’t take long for him to learn everything she had orchestrated. He would find out that she had tried to alter his memory, to make him forget Sadie for good. And Hailey knew he would never forgive her!
By then, she wouldn’t just lose her position as his wife and all the benefits that came with it—she knew the entire Burgess family would fall with her.
Panic seized her heart, and she suddenly found it hard to breathe.noveldrama
What should she do now? What else could she possibly do?
The bodyguards stood vigil on either side of Hailey, their expressions blank and indifferent to her obvious despair. After receiving Samuel’s signal, they lifted the limp Hailey and followed Samuel’s team.
Three hours later, Noah was transferred to a regular hospital ward. The room was dim and quiet.
Sadie tucked the blanket around him and sat by the bed, feeling utterly exhausted. She stared at his pale face, a pang of pain gripping her heart.

The recent events flooded her mind all at once—Sharon’s sudden, so-called passing, the unknown corpse at the funeral home, Hailey’s erratic behavior, and Stuart’s horrifying research. They all came with a mix of fear, anger, confusion, and dread, overwhelming her like a giant, relentless tide.
Sadie reached out and gently held Noah’s hand. It felt cold against her skin.
“Noah, you’d better wake up soon,” she said, her voice hoarse and tearful. “I have so many questions to ask you. Why did you lie to me about Sharon’s situation? What have you been hiding from me?”
In the end, Sadie couldn’t hold back any longer. She wept, tears flowing down her cheeks and dripping onto the back of Noah’s hand.
Just then, a gentle knock came at the door.
Samuel poked his head inside, holding up a file.

###Chapter 1093:
Sadie sat back, frowning. She wiped her tears away quickly, then quietly stood and walked into the hallway.
Samuel handed her the document. “We have the information, Ms. Hudson. The lead surgeon in the operating room calls himself Stuart. He’s an internationally renowned brain specialist. Recently, he founded a new research venture.”
Samuel’s voice faltered toward the end, and he paused to glance cautiously at Sadie.
She looked up from the report she was skimming. “Just say it.”
Samuel took a deep breath. “Stuart’s research involves brain implants in patients suffering from amnesia. The goal is to alter their memories. He developed the technology, but it’s still in the clinical trial phase. If he managed to go through with the procedure on Mr. Noel, the consequences would have been unimaginable.”
Sadie’s fingers curled inward as she processed the information. She felt suffocated, as if a heavy weight was pressing against her chest.
She had suspected Hailey’s erratic tendencies, but she never imagined her to be this demented.
So, Hailey had wanted to erase Noah’s memories, leaving only the parts that involved her. She wanted to be the only person Noah remembered. That woman was utterly despicable!
“Dr. Farrell Adams was originally scheduled to perform the surgery on Mr. Noel,” Samuel continued. “But he struck a deal with Ms. Burgess in exchange for money. Our team has already apprehended him at the airport. Also, Forest seems to have disappeared without a trace. Our people are looking for him, though we haven’t found a single lead.”
Sadie’s frown deepened. She closed the file with renewed determination. “We must find Forest, no matter what.”
Hailey and Forest had obviously been conspiring together from the start. They might have managed to catch Hailey, but Forest was still out there somewhere. Sadie couldn’t rest easy until he, too, was in custody.
“Understood, Ms. Hudson,” Samuel replied with a nod.
Sadie handed him the file. “Give this to Dr. Landon.”noveldrama
Find what you love at g?lnσν?s?
Samuel nodded again, then turned on his heel and left.
Inside Dawson’s office, tension hung thick in the air.
The moment his eyes scanned the document Samuel had handed him, a bead of sweat rolled down his temple.
Each sentence felt like a gut punch, hitting harder the further he read. Stuart—a world-famous expert in neurology—had apparently accepted a bribe from Hailey. The horrifying purpose? To perform unauthorized memory-altering experiments on Noah inside Ultracare Hospital.
The mere thought of what might have happened if Sadie had been even a minute late sent chills down Dawson’s spine. Had she arrived any later, there was no telling what kind of irreversible damage might have been done—or how Wall Group would have retaliated. Ultracare Hospital could have vanished from Jazmah overnight.
With trembling hands, he wiped the sweat from his brow and tried to steady his voice. “Mr. Ford, you have my word. We will treat this matter with the utmost seriousness. Wall Group will receive our full cooperation. We won’t allow this kind of failure to go unpunished.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1094:
Samuel gave a small nod, his eyes narrowing with warning. “Dr. Landon, you’ve been part of Jazmah’s medical scene long enough to know when to speak—and when to keep quiet.”
That was enough to make Dawson’s pulse spike. The message came through loud and clear.
Behind his composed exterior, panic surged. His back was soaked, and the implications hit him like a thunderclap. Sadie had addressed Patrick as Noah earlier, and now Samuel’s words meant this Patrick couldn’t possibly be just any patient.
He was beginning to realize—Patrick might be the former owner of Wall Group. Without hesitation, Dawson bowed deeply, his tone reverent. “Understood. I assure you, the only patient in our care is Mr. Noel. No one else is involved.”
Samuel looked satisfied. He gave a curt nod and turned to leave.
As the office door shut behind him, Dawson collapsed into his chair like a man whose strings had been cut. Breathing heavily, Dawson struggled to calm the frantic pounding of his heart.
Not long after, his assistant burst into the office, face flushed with outrage. “Dr. Landon, are we really just going to let this go? Ms. Hudson barged in here with her people, kicked open the operating room door, and even injured our guards! How are we supposed to ignore that?”
Frustration simmered in the assistant’s voice, growing more intense by the second. Ultracare Hospital had always held prestige in Jazmah. This—this kind of blatant disrespect—was unheard of.
That was all it took for Dawson to spring out of his chair. His eyes darted toward the office door and windows. After confirming everything was sealed tight, he hurried over to his assistant.
“You must have lost your mind,” he said, keeping his anger on a tight leash as he glanced around nervously.
With a sudden crack of sound, his foot connected with the assistant’s shin. The assistant winced in pain, stumbling back with a grimace, but stayed silent, swallowing the rest of his protests.
Dawson jabbed a finger toward him, voice still low but seething. “Do you even understand who we’re dealing with? Wall Group isn’t some company we can afford to cross. We’re lucky Mr. Noel got out of the operating room with just a scare. If anything serious had happened, we’d all be buried by now. And did you even catch what Ms. Hudson called him? She said Noah! That name alone should’ve made you think twice. We’re talking about secrets that only the most powerful families dare to whisper about.” Dawson trembled—not from anger, but fear.
That woman, Sadie… there was something about the way she looked at people, like she held their fates in her hands and didn’t mind crushing them. Dawson never wanted to feel that kind of helplessness again.

Realization finally dawned on the assistant after Dawson’s outburst. Still gripping his sore shin, he forced a sheepish grin onto his face. “Dr. Landon, you’re absolutely right! I wasn’t thinking clearly—thank you for setting me straight!”
A sharp snort escaped Dawson, though some of the tension in his features began to ease.noveldrama
He took a moment to adjust his rumpled clothes, standing taller as he slipped back into his usual air of forced authority. “Listen carefully. I want security doubled around Mr. Noel’s room—no excuses, no mistakes. And make sure every staff member is warned. No one is to breathe a word about today. If I catch even a hint of information slipping out, heads will roll.”
.

###Chapter 1095:
“Whisper about Mr. Noel or what happened, and they’re out—no discussions, no second chances.”
Without a second thought, the assistant bobbed his head in agreement. “Understood, Dr. Landon! I’ll take care of everything right away!” he said before rushing out of the room as if his life depended on it.
As the door shut behind him, Dawson let out a heavy breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. He moved to the window, staring at the gray clouds gathering outside, silently praying that this entire ordeal would blow over without further fallout.
Meanwhile, Samuel’s footsteps echoed down the hospital corridor, each step weighed down by unease. There had always been something about “Patrick” that didn’t sit right—his calm authority, the effortless control he wielded—it hinted at something much deeper than a regular identity. During the investigation into Sharon’s “death,” Samuel had harbored some vague suspicions.
Still, discovering that “Patrick” was actually Noah had shaken him to his core. Everything made sense now. Sadie’s fierce urgency, her willingness to tear through protocol—it wasn’t overreaction.
If something had gone wrong with Noah, the ripple effects would have been catastrophic.
Replay after replay raced through Samuel’s mind, each one tightening the knot of dread in his chest.
As Samuel replayed how Sadie’s behavior toward Patrick had shifted—from keeping her distance to watching him with growing worry—it hit him that she must have known who he really was for a long time. She had just chosen to keep that information under wraps out of fear of unforeseen consequences.
After all, those so-called secrets of the Wall family were actually common knowledge among those with enough power to matter.
Letting out a quiet breath, Samuel didn’t break stride as he continued down the corridor. He made his way back to Noah’s room and gave a light knock on the door.
A voice answered from within, giving him permission to enter.
Inside, the room was nearly silent, the only sounds coming from the hum and beep of the medical machines. Sadie sat beside the bed, her eyes locked on Noah’s pale face. Though she looked exhausted, she hadn’t moved her gaze for a second.
L?tt chαpt?rs ιn glnov?l.m
Samuel stepped closer and offered a slight bow. “Ms. Hudson, I’ve spoken with Dr. Landon. Everything will be handled as you requested.”
Sadie gave a subtle nod in response, but her attention didn’t waver.
“I’ll stay with him tonight,” she said quietly, her voice rough around the edges. “You focus on everything else, especially the Burgess family—don’t let them try anything harmful again.”noveldrama
“I understand,” Samuel replied, keeping his tone respectful.
Just as he turned to leave, he paused, uncertain.
Sadie caught the hesitation and narrowed her eyes. “What is it?”
There was a brief silence before Samuel responded, his voice low and cautious, “It’s about Mr. Noel… about Mr. Wall’s true identity. I’m concerned we may not be able to keep it hidden much longer.”
Before he even finished, Sadie’s eyes dimmed with acknowledgment. She already knew this secret was on borrowed time.

###Chapter 1096:
The chaos at Ultracare Hospital, despite her best efforts to suppress it, would eventually find its way into the world. And with people like Hailey and Forest scrambling to save themselves, there was no doubt they’d throw gasoline on the fire if it meant shifting the public’s attention.
A soft sigh escaped her lips as her shoulders sagged. The weight of inevitability had finally settled.
Her eyes drifted toward the night sky outside the window, and her voice carried the weight of exhaustion. “Back then, Coyle and Sutton were stirring up chaos, and Noah had no memory of who he was. Bringing him back to the Wall family like that—it would’ve been throwing him into the fire. I kept quiet about who he really was because I wanted him to become stronger and get his memories back first. I just didn’t think things would spiral this fast…”
Never had Sadie imagined Hailey would be reckless enough to push things this far, coming so close to igniting a disaster.
Now that the damage was done, there was no longer any room for secrecy. Rather than wait for others to expose it, Sadie decided to reveal it herself.
A flicker of resolve sparked in her eyes as she sorted through her thoughts. Turning toward Samuel, she said with quiet determination, “Tomorrow morning, send someone to Wall Manor. Ask Isabel to come here.”
As Noah’s mother and a key shareholder in Wall Group, Isabel held power that couldn’t be ignored. It was time for Isabel to hear everything and take charge of the choices that would shape the future of the family.
Samuel blinked in surprise, but understanding quickly settled in. This wasn’t just a request—it was a declaration. Sadie was about to make Patrick’s identity official.
Drawing in a slow breath, he gave a firm nod. “Understood, Ms. Hudson. I’ll take care of it right away.”
Once the door closed behind him, silence returned to the room.
Sadie reached for Noah’s hand, feeling the coldness in his fingers seep into her chest like ice. She leaned close, her voice cracking with emotion as she whispered, “You’re going to be alright, Noah. You have to be.”
Outside, the sky had turned completely black, as if the world itself had fallen into shadow.
Let your imagination soar with gα?ησν?s．?οnoveldrama
Still seated at Noah’s bedside, Sadie rested her head beside his and drifted into sleep without realizing it.
In the stillness of the hospital room, the only sound was the steady, mechanical rhythm of the medical equipment.
At some unknown hour, a soft sensation stirred Sadie from her slumber. Fingers brushed gently through her hair, radiating a warmth she hadn’t felt in what seemed like forever.
With a jolt, she sat up straight, fully awake in an instant.
Her drowsy gaze locked onto a pair of familiar, tender eyes.
They weren’t just watching her—they were drinking her in, like a lost treasure suddenly returned.
For a moment, she couldn’t move.
She blinked once. Then again.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1097:
And then it hit her—Noah was awake.
Really, truly awake.
Emotion surged so quickly that it stole her breath. Her chest tightened, and tears gathered before she could even try to stop them.
The joy was overwhelming—so much that it made her vision blur.
When Noah saw her tears, his expression softened, a subtle sadness flickering across his face.
He slowly lifted his hand, trying to brush the wetness from her cheek with trembling care.
But that gentle touch—so familiar, so fragile—sent a shiver down Sadie’s spine. A buried memory snapped to the surface, and before she could stop herself, she flinched away from his touch, shoving his hand aside with unexpected force.
The rejection stunned Noah. His hand hovered mid-air, and his eyes dimmed, a flash of hurt surfacing in their depths.
Sadie quickly wiped her face with the back of her hand, chasing away the tears as if they were evidence of weakness.
She sucked in a deep breath, stood abruptly, and turned her back on him. Her tone became frigid as she said, “You’re awake, so that works out just fine. There’s something I need to ask you.”
The air itself seemed to freeze as Sadie’s words fell over the room.
Noah lowered his gaze.
He knew exactly what she wanted to ask—the secrets of the past that he had kept hidden. He had always hoped that she would never have to deal with them.
Noah swallowed before speaking, though his voice was still a little raspy. “Sadie, if you have something to say, just say it.”
Sadie whipped around and fixed her piercing eyes on him. “Is Sharon really dead?” she demanded in a trembling voice.
The question hit Noah like a blow to the chest. He clenched his hands so hard that his knuckles turned white.
He raised his head and met her stubborn gaze. “Sadie,” he said, sounding resigned, “Everything I’ve done was all for you. The past is behind us now. Can’t we just let it go and start fresh?”
?tｅt ? ? gαlnovels.ｃοm
He tried to soften his tone, hoping to coax her away from those painful memories. “I don’t think your parents would want you to be trapped in the past, either.”
There was more he wanted to say, but Sadie didn’t want to listen for a second longer.
“You don’t understand!” she snapped, her voice filled with sorrow and disappointment. “You don’t understand me at all!” Her parents had been missing for seventeen years. Laura had died with that haunted, worried look on her face, and Sadie knew she wouldn’t forget that expression for the rest of her life.
She needed to find her parents and uncover what had truly happened to them. It wasn’t just some mindless obsession—it was her duty as their daughter.
Noah’s brows furrowed at her outburst.

###Chapter 1098:
He wanted to reach out and hold her hand, to calm her down and make her listen to his explanation.
But Sadie must have read his mind, because she took a step back, just out of his reach.
Her gaze was cold and resolute. “If you won’t tell me, then I’ll find the truth myself. I’ll do it, no matter the cost!”
Noah’s throat tightened with emotion. If he revealed the truth to her, it would only reopen old wounds that had yet to heal. But he knew that Sadie would never let this matter go. If she pursued it on her own, she would put herself in potential danger.
In the end, Noah pressed his lips into a thin line and turned away. He said nothing.
When Sadie saw this, the spark in her eyes faded.
So he still didn’t want to tell her.
Her lips curled into a wry, self-deprecating smile.
Then she turned and stormed out of the room without another word.
The door clicked shut with a finality that echoed in Noah’s soul. He couldn’t help but compare that door to a gaping chasm that was now between him and Sadie.
Meanwhile, Sadie was walking down the hallway when she saw Isabel rushing over, accompanied by Samuel.
Isabel’s eyes filled with fresh tears as she grabbed Sadie’s hand. “Sadie, is he… Is he really Noah? Has my Noah truly returned?”
Sadie stroked the older woman’s back and said soothingly, “Don’t get too worked up, Isabel. Only a few of us know about Noah’s identity at the moment. For his safety, as well as Wall Group’s stability, we can’t let anyone else know yet, especially since he still hasn’t fully recovered his memory.”
Isabel had lived long enough to understand the gravity of the situation. She composed herself and nodded, though she didn’t bother to hide her relief.
“You’re always so level-headed, Sadie. I got a little too emotional back there. I almost forgot what his return means.”
Although the Wall family might appear harmonious to the outside world, Isabel knew that the elders were comprised of cunning foxes. They all had their eyes on Wall Group, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike.
Sadie couldn’t afford to have anything happen that might disrupt that thin veil of peace.

“You can go in and see Noah,” Sadie said gently. “I’ll head home and freshen up, then I’ll be right back.”
Isabel gave Sadie a deep, lingering look but said nothing as she turned and entered the ward.
Instead of following her inside, Samuel caught up with Sadie. They strode down the hospital corridor and rounded the corner.
“Any movement from the Castro family?” Sadie asked in a voice that only Samuel could hear.
.
.
.noveldrama
###Chapter 1343:
Samuel matched her volume when he replied, “Mr. Ralph Castro has not left Castro Manor since his return. Mr. Blaine Castro, on the other hand, left the city recently. He returned the very same night.” Samuel paused, as if bracing himself. “We found out that the day he left was the same day Sharon went missing.”
Sadie’s steps halted abruptly. She stared at the floor, her brows furrowing in a deep frown. Blaine again.
Her gaze turned icy. “I’d like to see Blaine. Tell him to come to Myrtlewood Estate.”
Samuel nodded immediately. “Understood, Ms. Hudson. I’ll make the arrangements right away.”
Two hours slipped by before Blaine finally arrived at Myrtlewood Estate. Predictably, he was running late.
Beads of sweat glistened on his forehead while his fingers fidgeted relentlessly, wrinkling the collar of his shirt. The easy charm that usually danced in his eyes had faded, replaced with a look that was more defensive than playful.
He clung to his car keys so tightly that his knuckles turned pale, his grip leaving his hand damp and chilled.
Why on earth did Sadie ask to meet him? All he had done was run a simple errand for his grandfather. Nothing more, nothing less.
He shot a desperate look toward Samuel, who stood sentry at the door, hoping for even a subtle sign that he wasn’t about to walk into a disaster.
Samuel turned slightly away and replied with nothing but a shrug.
There would be no help from him. His role was to carry out Sadie’s orders, not interfere.
That small gesture told Blaine everything he needed to know—he had to face this alone.
How did Sadie manage to uncover everything so fast? He hadn’t even had time to cover his tracks.
If word ever got back to his grandfather, Blaine knew he’d be lucky to escape in one piece.
Yet there was no escaping it now. He’d walked straight into this mess and had no option but to deal with the consequences.noveldrama

Bracing himself, Blaine straightened up and walked into the living room. Sadie lounged quietly on the luxurious sofa, her expression perfectly unreadable. On the table in front of her, two cremation urns sat side by side, silent and ominous.
A heavy tension pressed down on the room, making it hard for Blaine to breathe. A chill ran up his neck, causing his skin to ripple with unease. He froze, caught between steps, unsure whether to move forward or retreat.
He tried to play it cool, stretching his lips into a smile that felt painfully stiff. “Sadie, you called me over like it’s some kind of emergency—” he said, trying to lighten the mood.
His attempt at lightening the atmosphere fell flat. Sadie didn’t even bother to glance his way. Her reply was ice-cold, cutting him off before he could finish.
“Blaine, let’s skip the charade. Patrick’s already spilled everything. Where’s Sharon?”
Blaine felt her accusation slam into him, knocking the wind out of him. That forced smile faltered, and he stared at her, wide-eyed and stunned.
.
.

###Chapter XXX:
This couldn’t be happening. Noah, of all people, had folded? The guy was usually as tight-lipped as they came. How had Sadie managed to pry the truth out of him so easily?
Back then, no matter what he tried, Noah had never budged. Yet somehow, Sadie got him to spill everything? It didn’t make sense.
Samuel, who lingered by the door, showed a flicker of surprise at Sadie’s unexpected statement. When had Patrick supposedly confessed? Samuel hadn’t caught even a whisper about it. That’s when the realization hit—Sadie had to be bluffing. Samuel lowered his gaze, slipping easily into the role of an invisible bystander. A creeping sense of unease swept over Blaine, making his skin itch with anxiety.noveldrama
He sneaked another glance at Sadie.
She sat there as if nothing could shake her—so completely in control that Blaine couldn’t tell whether she was bluffing or simply already knew every answer.
Could Noah truly betray him like that, all for a chance to win Sadie’s heart? To be honest, Blaine wouldn’t be surprised at all. It was obvious to anyone that Noah was utterly captivated by her.
After wrestling with his thoughts, Blaine decided there was no point in hiding anything. There was nothing he’d done that crossed a line, and Noah had betrayed him first. Besides, Sharon wasn’t in any danger.
He inhaled deeply, steadying himself, then addressed Sadie.
“Look, Sadie, I hope you won’t misunderstand my intentions,” he said. “I give you my word, I did carry out the plan to move Sharon, but I never meant her any harm.”
“She’s currently in a private care facility just outside the city. Security is tight, and nobody can visit without official approval from the Castro family. Only my grandfather can sign off on that.”
Sadie’s eyebrows flickered at this new information.
In the end, Ralph remained the only gatekeeper she’d have to contend with. Lifting her cup to her lips, she took a measured sip, her face giving nothing away.
Her voice stayed calm as she asked, “Besides that, what else are you hiding from me?”
Blaine was stunned. His eyes grew wide as his mind scrambled to make sense of what he had just heard.

Hadn’t Sadie said Noah already told her everything? Why was she still asking him about this? Could it be…
A thought hit him like a bolt of lightning, leaving him shuddering in fright. His hand instinctively reached up and connected with his forehead in a resounding slap.
Sadie had tricked him into spilling the truth.
This was a complete disaster. His grandfather would dress him down for sure.
Sadie stood up and took a step closer, her gaze chillingly cold.
“Blaine, I’ve always considered you family. I want you to be honest with me now.”
Blaine froze, even as beads of cold sweat began to dot his face.
Regret washed over him. He had effectively trapped himself in a corner. If he had known that Sadie was this sharp and quick-witted, he would have never even thought about deceiving her.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1101:
“Listen, Sadie, you can’t pin all the blame on me,” he said in a strained voice. “I swear, I don’t know all that much! I’m just a gofer, running errands for my grandfather and dropping Sharon off at that nursing home out of the city. It’s heavily guarded—no one just walks in or out. That’s all I know. My grandfather hasn’t told me anything else. When Patrick came to Castro Manor to talk with my grandfather, they did it behind closed doors. I have no idea what they talked about.”
Blaine was breathing heavily by the time he finished speaking. He silently cursed his circumstances.
Even he had never imagined that his grandfather and Noah would keep such a huge secret from Sadie. And now, it was he who was stuck.
Sadie’s perfectly arched brows furrowed slightly.
Ralph was certainly meticulous with his methods; he left no room for mistakes. What had really happened seventeen years ago, when her parents had first disappeared? What had happened five years ago? Were there more secrets buried in the fire at Faron Retreat?
Sadie pushed the tangled thoughts aside and focused on the task at hand. “Then tell me this one thing—did Ralph’s sudden return have anything to do with Sharon?”
Blaine physically recoiled at the question. He was clearly taken aback, perhaps because the answer was glaringly obvious.
Blaine didn’t know the full story, but he had noticed that ever since his grandfather had returned, the old man had been consumed with Sharon’s affairs. He swallowed audibly before nodding. “I would say so, yes. My grandfather has been all about Sharon since his return. He hasn’t paid much attention to anything else.”noveldrama
Sadie felt her heart sink.
So it was true—Sharon must be holding vital clues to the past. “Did Ralph ever visit Faron Retreat five years ago?”
Blaine blinked at her.
He rifled through his mind, but he had been living abroad at the time. He was completely out of the loop when it came to his family’s matters.
“I honestly don’t know, Sadie,” Blaine replied with an apologetic shake of his head. “I spent most of my time overseas during that period. I have no idea what was going on with the family.”
The light in Sadie’s eyes dimmed.
She had expected this much, but she still felt disappointed.
The trail had gone cold again. Blaine felt uneasy at her downcast expression. After mulling it over, he sighed and offered her some advice.
“Sadie, sometimes there are things you’re better off not knowing.”
“I’m sure Patrick and my grandfather have their reasons for keeping things from you. Maybe they just want to protect you. Some things are simply—”
“Let me guess,” Sadie interrupted. “Meant to be let go, right?”
Her tone was laced with bitter mockery.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1102:
Indeed, practically everyone had told her to let it go. But these were her parents. How was she supposed to just move on?
Sadie slowly sank into the sofa.
Blaine watched her deflate, his chest churning with emotion.
He might always come across as reckless and carefree, but he wasn’t heartless.
If it were his own parents, he would probably be even more desperate and unhinged than Sadie ever was.
So what if he ended up with a good beating? He had taken plenty growing up. If it meant helping a friend, he would gladly let his grandfather whip him until he was bruised and bloody.
Taking a deep breath, Blaine raised his chin and shot up from his seat. He thumped a fist against his chest, like he was declaring war on the rest of the world.
“Don’t despair, Sadie. I will help you! It’s just Castro Manor, just my old grandfather. I will take you there myself. I can’t just stand by and watch you suffer. We shall get to the bottom of this!”
Sadie lifted her head and met his determined gaze with a teary one of her own. Blaine’s face was etched with a mix of worry and sincerity. She couldn’t help but feel warm at his selfless bravery.
So she wiped the corners of her eyes, and when she got to her feet, there was a renewed resolve in her eyes.
“Thank you, Blaine. I really appreciate it.” Although her voice was soft, it carried an unmistakable strength. “But this is my personal business. I need to face Ralph myself. I’ve made up my mind that I will uncover the truth, no matter what it takes, no matter how long I have to search. I don’t want to drag anyone else into it.”
But Blaine just waved his hand dismissively.
He knew better than anyone just how stubborn his grandfather could be. Once Ralph Castro set his mind on something, no one could change his mind.noveldrama
Their only chance of knowing the truth was through Sharon.
“You don’t know my grandfather like I do. Once he has made up his mind, there is nothing anyone can do or say to make him yield. Sharon may be the only person who can tell you anything.”

Something flickered in Sadie’s eyes.
Blaine had a point, but getting Sharon out of the nursing home was no easy task. He had said as much himself. How could they convince Ralph to have her released?
“Don’t you need your grandfather’s official permission to get Sharon out of that nursing home?” she asked to confirm.
Blaine smirked and puffed out his chest.
He was no stranger to this kind of game. Forging his grandfather’s signature was a craft he had mastered a long time ago. “Please. I could copy his signature in my sleep.”
Sadie frowned, not entirely convinced that it was a good idea.
After all, this wasn’t just some childish prank—it was serious business. She didn’t want to get Blaine into unnecessary trouble. He had already done so much for her.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1103:
“Look, Blaine, if—if this blows up in our faces, just say that it was all my idea. Tell your grandfather I made you do it.”
Blaine acted as if he didn’t hear anything, grabbing her by the arm and pulling her toward the door.
This kind of thing had to be done as quickly as possible. The longer they waited, the greater the risk. They had to move faster than Ralph.
“Come on, there’s no time to waste!”
Sadie watched him charge ahead, full of vigor, and could only smile resignedly. Meanwhile, Hailey was well and truly confined in her own villa.
The security around the villa was tight, with numerous teams of cold-faced bodyguards stationed at practically every corner.
Hailey was pacing back and forth, her chest heaving in outrage. She was the heiress of the Burgess family, always pampered, always surrounded by luxury. How could she endure such humiliation?
She was livid, but she knew better than to lash out.
These men were no ordinary bodyguards—each one looked like he could snap her bones without breaking a sweat.
Just then, she heard muffled thuds from outside the window.
Hailey walked over to see what was going on and watched as the guards dropped one by one, like puppets whose strings were cut.
She let out a gasp of disbelief. What was going on?
She reached up and rubbed her eyes to check if she was hallucinating.
The next thing she knew, the door swung open from the outside.
Forest burst into the villa, flanked by a number of his subordinates.
“Come with me, Hailey—right now!”
Hailey’s nose stung, and her eyes welled up with tears.

Her father might have been unreliable on most days, but he certainly came through when she was in a crisis.
“Dad!” she cried out, rushing over to him. “Everything is a mess! Stuart totally blew it. Sadie caught him, and Noah… He will never forgive me! What are we going to do now?”
Forest’s expression tightened at the sight of her anguish, but his voice remained calm.
“Don’t panic just yet,” he said, patting her shoulder. “Do you really think I would make a move without a contingency plan?”
Hailey jerked her head up, staring at Forest in surprise.
She had always seen him as a greedy businessman obsessed with making a profit. She didn’t expect him to still have a few cards up his sleeve.
“Dad? What else have you done?”
Forest’s eyes darted to the door as he listened carefully for any sign of commotion.
“Come on, we need to move. The effects of the sleeping gas will wear off soon. We can talk once we’re in the car.”

###Chapter 1104:
Hailey didn’t . She was desperate to escape this hellhole, to breathe freely again.
She nodded and followed Forest as they raced out of the villa.
Hailey and Forest had just arrived at the villa’s threshold.
A short distance away, Isabel emerged from a glossy obsidian vehicle. She’d come straight from Ultracare Hospital after seeing her child—her spirit weighed down by dread.
She wasn’t here by chance. Her goal was clear: to meet Hailey and determine what game she was playing.
As she began to approach the villa, her gaze zeroed in on Hailey and Forest.
Wasn’t Hailey meant to be under Sadie’s people’s watch? Had she broken loose? It hit Isabel like a freight train. Her mouth parted, ready to call out.
But then Forest’s piercing stare connected with hers, halting her instantly.
Without pause, he flicked his eyes toward the guard at his side.
The bodyguard reacted instantly. His weapon cut through the air with swiftness.
A heavy, muted impact followed.
Isabel crumpled silently, knocked out before a word could leave her lips.
Hailey recoiled, her breath faltering. A sick feeling swelled in her chest.
“Dad…” she whispered, her hand gripping Forest’s arm tightly.
That was Noah’s mother. If something happened to her now, they’d never be able to fix it.
Forest’s eyes gleamed with fury. There was no undoing this.
Isabel had come at the perfect time. She had only herself to blame. Now, they had another card up their sleeve.
Forest’s hold on Hailey’s arm grew firmer. His voice dropped, firm and dangerous.
“If you want to keep living a life of luxury, you’d better keep quiet. Everything I’ve done, Hailey, has been for us—for our name. Remember where we were three years ago? Without Noah, we’d have lost it all. We saved that boy, and this is his thanks? Now he wants to discard us for Sadie? We’re alone in this now. No allies left. They’ve pushed us too far.”
Hailey’s mind reeled, her father’s words clanging in her skull.
Then something shifted. Her fear cooled into icy determination. He was right.
The sting of betrayal burned through her chest.
Straightening her shoulders, she met his eyes, steeled.
Her words were low but unwavering. “Tell me what to do next.”
Forest’s jaw clenched. A flicker of something ruthless crossed his face.
“I’ve already sent some people to take Averi.”
The statement shattered Hailey’s composure.
Averi—Noah and Sadie’s only child.noveldrama

###Chapter 1105:
Would her father harm him? Panic spiraled through her mind as she imagined dark outcomes.
If something tragic befell Averi—the heir of the Wall family—then the unborn life inside her, believed to be Noah’s, would stand as his sole descendant. And if the real story stayed buried, the world would accept her as the rightful matriarch of the Wall family.
The powerful family, desperate to preserve their name, would have no alternatives. Her child would be their heir. A slow, venomous grin crept across her face.
Forest saw the shift—and returned the expression, just as ruthless.
Meanwhile, Blaine and Sadie cruised down a quiet road leading to a secluded nursing home on the city’s edge.
In Blaine’s grip was a falsified note—crafted earlier. He had mirrored his grandfather’s penmanship with uncanny accuracy.
“She’s in Room 102. Be alert. I’ll wait in the car—if something goes wrong, I’ll step in.”
He was ready to intervene if things spiraled.
Sadie accepted the note with a nod. “Appreciate it, Blaine.” She tightened her coat around her and stepped out.
Near the doorway, a watchful guard monitored comings and goings.
Steeling herself, Sadie approached, her expression calm and deliberate.
“Hello. I represent Mr. Ralph Castro. I’m here to see Sharon Buckley. This message comes directly from him—handwritten.”
Sadie handed over the note.
The security guard took it with suspicion clouding his face, his eyes scanning every inch as he checked it more than once.
His fingers ran across its smooth texture, noting the refined design and the unmistakable seal of the Castro family. Everything appeared to be in order. After a few more seconds of scrutiny, he finally stepped aside and pulled the gate open.
“You may go in, ma’am.”
Sadie released a breath she had been holding and moved quickly through the gate toward the main building.
The inside of the nursing home was even quieter than she had expected. Empty halls stretched before her, broken only by the occasional nurse pushing a medical cart in a rush.
Guided by the room number Blaine had given her, she walked with cautious steps, scanning the doors as she passed.
At the far end of the second-floor hallway, she came to a stop in front of Room 102.
She paused for a moment, steadying her breath before raising her hand to knock gently on the door.noveldrama
“Sharon? Sharon, are you inside?” she called softly.
Silence greeted her. Not a sound came from the room.
A strange chill crept down her spine, making her hesitate.

###Chapter 1106:
Her nerves overrode her better judgment, and she pushed the door open. It had been left slightly ajar.
What she saw the moment she stepped inside made her freeze in place. Her eyes lifted—and met Ralph’s steady gaze. The shock ran through her like electricity.
What was Ralph doing here?
Her gaze darted across the room, searching for Sharon.
Ralph was seated calmly on the sofa, and off to the side stood Alfredo, the loyal butler of the Castro family. But Sharon was nowhere in sight. In that instant, the
A small flicker of hope inside Sadie vanished completely. She stepped further in and greeted Ralph politely.
“Mr. Castro.”
A long, drawn-out sigh escaped Ralph’s lips.
He had expected perseverance from Sadie. What he hadn’t seen coming was his own rebellious grandson stepping in—and forging his handwriting on top of it.
Sadie continued, her voice calm but steady, “Mr. Castro, I know you’ve always tried to protect me. These past three years, you’ve taken care of me, and I’ll always be thankful. But I’m not a child anymore. I deserve to know the truth—and I can handle it. Please… just this once, let me decide for myself.”
Ralph lowered his head slightly. As he studied Sadie’s face, a familiar image flickered in his memory—his old friend, Absolon.
The same defiance lived in her. That same fire. That same unwavering will. Ralph sat in silence for a brief moment, struggling to find the right words.
His hand reached up to adjust his glasses. His eyes, though clear, shimmered faintly with restrained emotion.
“Sadie, there are truths that do more harm than good. Some things only bring pain once you dig them up. Why force yourself to know?”
Before he could finish what he was trying to say, a loud bang echoed in the room. The door slammed open with a crash.
Blaine rushed inside, his breath ragged, his eyes frantic. He didn’t even glance around the room before blurting out, “Sadie! I just got a call from Wall Manor—Averi’s gone!”
Sadie stood frozen in place. Her thoughts stopped. Averi was missing?

Only then did Blaine take notice of the others in the room. His eyes fell on Ralph, whose expression had gone stone cold.
All at once, Blaine fell silent. His unease was written all over his face.
What in the world was happening? Why was his grandfather here?
Sadie snapped out of her daze. Her shock vanished.
“Mr. Castro, I’m really sorry. We’ll have to talk another time.” With those words, she turned on her heel and dashed out of the room.noveldrama
Blaine remained frozen, awkwardness settling over him like a second skin. His palms were damp, and his heart sank.
“Grandpa, I’m going too. Maybe I can help out somehow or…”
He didn’t bother finishing. The moment his words left his mouth, he was already sprinting after Sadie. Ralph and Alfredo exchanged a glance, silent and thoughtful.

###Chapter 1107:
By then, Sadie had already flung herself into the car and slammed the door shut. Blaine rushed in right behind her and dropped into the passenger seat.
“Sadie, try not to panic, okay? Maybe Averi just wandered off for a bit. Maybe by the time we get there, he’s already back.”
Sadie shook her head. Her lips pressed together, trembling ever so slightly.
“No. That’s not it.”
She knew her son too well. Averi wasn’t the type to stray. He wasn’t reckless or careless, and he never disappeared without a reason.
That thought stabbed straight through her chest. A wave of panic surged upward, and she bit down hard on her bottom lip to keep from falling apart.
She twisted the key, started the engine, and tore down the road.
The drive back to Wall Manor took thirty long minutes.
Once they arrived, chaos had already taken over. The usually composed staff were all flustered.
Sadie caught sight of the butler standing amid the confusion and ran straight toward him.
“What’s going on?”
Breck looked like he was about to collapse. He bowed again and again, his face pale and his voice shaking.
“Ma’am, I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. I should have kept a better eye on Averi!”
“I went to pick up Averi from school like I always do, but traffic held me up longer than expected. When I finally arrived, the teacher said someone had already picked him up. Panic hit me like a punch to the chest. I called the house immediately and rushed back as fast as I could—but Averi hadn’t come home. That’s when I knew something was really wrong. I’ve already sent people out to search every corner, but there hasn’t been a single lead.”
Sadie felt her head spin. The stress of pregnancy had already worn her thin, and this news nearly knocked her off balance.
Blaine moved quickly, catching her arm before she fell. His voice was tight with worry. “Sadie, are you alright?”
She gave him a faint wave, brushing off the concern. Of course she wasn’t alright—how could she be? But this wasn’t the moment to crumble. She had to stay focused. Averi needed her. Taking in a shaky breath, she forced her thoughts to sharpen.
“Check the surveillance footage from the school entrance. And send someone to ask Isabel if she went there!”

She clung to that small thread of hope, as thin and unlikely as it was. “Maybe Isabel picked him up after leaving Ultracare Hospital, and they just got delayed. We can’t panic. We have to stay focused.”noveldrama
At that moment, Samuel burst into the house. His expression was dark, his voice urgent.
“Ms. Hudson, I’m really sorry I didn’t do a good job. Our team just reported that Forest had taken Hailey away. And not just her—surveillance footage shows Mrs. Isabel Wall was taken along with her!”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1108:
Every new detail hit harder than the one before.
Samuel kept his eyes lowered, too ashamed to look at Sadie directly as he delivered the report.
Sadie’s fists clenched tightly at her sides.
Once again, it was the Burgess family. She should have known.
Someone like Forest wasn’t going to back down just because things hadn’t gone his way. She had seriously misjudged the depths of their shamelessness.
“Disgusting Burgess family,” she said, her voice sharp enough to cut glass. A terrible thought slammed into her. “Averi… what if they took Averi too?”
If anything had happened to her son, she would never forgive a single one of the Burgess family.
Her fists curled even tighter, knuckles paling. The Burgess family had finally crossed the line she’d sworn no one would ever cross.
Lifting her chin, she squared her shoulders, refusing to show weakness.
“Send the order immediately. Every international partner we’ve ever worked with needs to hear this. From this moment on, the Burgess Group is blacklisted—completely. If they try to sell their shares, the Wall Group will buy every last one. No exceptions. And tell everyone loud and clear—if I find out someone’s helping them behind closed doors, that person becomes my enemy too.”
Samuel’s breath caught in his throat. This was no warning—it was a full-on economic assault that could bury the Burgess Group for good. He responded without hesitation, “Yes, Ms. Hudson. I’ll get on it right away!” Then he turned and hurried out the door without looking back.
Sadie shifted her gaze to Blaine.
“Blaine, I need your help. Get people to search every corner of Jazmah. We have to find Averi. I can’t trust anyone else with this.”noveldrama
In a moment like this, Blaine was the only one she knew wouldn’t fail her. Finding Averi came before everything. There was no room for mistakes. No time for doubt.
Blaine gave a sharp nod. “You can count on me, Sadie. I’ll take care of it.” His eyes moved to the butler, who still looked shaken. “Bring in the best doctor you can find. Make sure Sadie gets the care she needs.”

Relief flashed across the butler’s face as he nodded quickly. “Yes, Mr. Castro. I’ll handle everything.”
He reached out to support Sadie, his voice gentle with worry. “Ma’am, please come inside. You need to rest. Your health matters too.”
But Sadie’s eyes drifted, unfocused. Her thoughts refused to settle. After a quiet beat, she said, “Send more people to watch Ultracare Hospital. Forest and Hailey don’t care who they hurt. They won’t stop chasing Noah.”
Blaine caught the weight in her voice and answered with steady calm, “You’ve got it, Sadie. Now go get some rest.”
The butler steadied Sadie as she inched her way into the spacious living room, her movements deliberate and careful.
His face etched with worry, he barked out an order to a servant without hesitation.
“Hurry! Get Dr. Norris here, now!”
.

.
###Chapter 1109:
The servant dared not hesitate. She nodded briskly and pivoted on her heel, darting from the room at once.
Sadie clutched her throbbing abdomen, her brows knitted together in discomfort. She waved her hand weakly. “I need some time alone.”
The butler parted his lips to protest, but upon noticing the ghostly pallor of her skin, he exhaled heavily, bowed his head, and retreated in silence.
Stillness instantly swallowed the spacious living room.
Sadie’s abdomen had been throbbing for days now—without any discernible cause.
She tenderly caressed her still-flat stomach, murmuring under her breath,
“Hang in there, sweetheart. You have to remain strong for me.”
The child growing inside her remained her sole source of strength now. Roughly ten minutes later, the doctor finally arrived, breaking the oppressive silence.
He wore a thick medical mask and full protective gear, his head bowed as he trailed the servant into the room.
Sadie lifted her heavy eyelids and cast a skeptical glance at him.
Judging by his build and gait, this doctor struck her as unfamiliar.
Her brows furrowed ever so slightly as suspicion flickered across her face.
“Where’s Dr. Norris? Are you new?” Caution laced her tone.
The man simply nodded in response, offering no words.
Just then, a fierce jolt of pain tore through Sadie’s abdomen. Cold sweat instantly beaded across her forehead.
The pain was excruciating, robbing her of coherent thought. Grimacing, she beckoned the doctor forward.
“Hurry. Check me,” she managed to say between labored breaths.
The man remained silent. He advanced with unsettling calm, his medical kit clutched in hand.noveldrama
Crouching down, he deliberately extracted a stethoscope from the kit. Meanwhile, his other hand—shrouded in the shadows of the kit—slipped into the lower compartment, where a dagger gleamed menacingly in the dim light.

In an instant, the man’s eyes turned cold and feral.
Without warning, he pounced—thrusting the dagger straight toward Sadie’s abdomen!
The attack erupted so violently, so unexpectedly, that no one had time to react. Sadie’s pupils constricted in horror. At the very last moment, she overcame the searing pain and flung herself to one side.
The blade grazed her arm, tearing open her sleeve and carving a thin, crimson line in its wake.
The nearby servant stood paralyzed with terror. Then, panic seized her, and she screamed at the top of her lungs, “Help! Someone! Help!”

###Chapter 1110:
The murderous doctor released a primal growl. His dark eyes burned with hatred as he spun toward the new target.
Without hesitation, he brandished the dagger again—and silenced the servant with a savage thrust. Blood sprayed across the plush carpet.
Sadie’s heart plunged. For a split second, ice seemed to crystallize in her veins. Most of Wall Manor’s security forces had been dispatched by Blaine, scattered across Jazmah in their search for Averi.
The new guards had yet to arrive. The estate now stood vulnerably exposed, its security at its most precarious point.
Sadie compelled herself to maintain composure as she punched the emergency number with quivering fingers.
But the assailant had taken note. His predatory gaze locked onto her as he stalked forward, the dagger poised to strike.
The call connected just then. A composed female voice crackled through the speaker.
“Emergency services. What’s your emergency?” The dispatcher’s crisp tone filled the room.
Sadie compressed her lips and withheld an immediate response.
She swiftly toggled the phone to speaker mode and, with subtle movements, wedged it face-down into the crevice of the sofa.
The dispatcher, disturbed by the ominous silence, grew increasingly vigilant.
Sadie balled her fists, desperately trying to buy precious seconds.
“We don’t even know each other. Why do you want to kill me?” Her voice remained steadier than she felt.
The assailant advanced another step, then violently tore off his mask—unveiling a twisted grin.
“You destroyed my life, you bitch! You deserve to die!” Spittle flew from his contorted mouth.
The dispatcher instantly grasped the gravity of the situation. “Ma’am, stay calm! Help is on the way! Please, do whatever you can to protect yourself!” The dispatcher’s voice hardened with professional urgency.
Sadie sensed a flicker of hope ignite within her. If she could endure until the police arrived, she and her baby might yet survive this nightmare.noveldrama

She snatched up a nearby pillow and hugged it to her chest as a makeshift shield.
Her gaze remained riveted on the deranged man advancing toward her.
There was something disturbingly familiar about his face.
Then, in a blinding flash of recognition, a name exploded into her consciousness—Farrell Adams. The very doctor who was set to perform Noah’s cranial repair at Ultracare Hospital, but had vanished at the last moment, nearly triggering a catastrophe.
During her investigation into Hailey and Lawson, Sadie had unearthed Farrell’s connections.
Her eyes smoldered with fury. “Farrell,” she hissed through clenched teeth, “you’re a doctor—your duty is to save lives. Yet you conspired with the Burgess family for money, and now you’re killing innocent people.”

###Chapter 1111:
“You brought this on yourself,” Sadie said. “This is simply the price you need to pay.”noveldrama
Farrell threw his head back, his wild eyes shining with unshed tears, and let out a loud, maniacal laugh. “Decades of grinding away—pulling all-nighters, giving up everything—just to make it into a top-tier private hospital like Ultracare! And now, it’s all gone down the drain… You ruined everything, you spiteful, vindictive bitch!”
He looked like a man possessed, all too ready to tear the room apart with his bare hands.
Sadie felt a chill spread through her chest.
She quickly scanned the room, but the living room was bare. There was nothing she could grab and use to defend herself.
Gritting her teeth, she said, “Farrell, it’s not too late to turn this around. Listen—I can help you work in another field. If you want, I can even give you the money you need to start over. Think about it.” It was the only thing she could think of to stall him.
Farrell paused, and she thought his resolve was wavering.
But then he let out another laugh, this one louder and more unhinged than the last.
“Start over?” he spat out, as if it was the most ridiculous thing he had ever heard. “Who do you think you are, Sadie? Some kind of saint? I’m telling you right here, right now—it’s over. It’s all over, and it’s all your fault.”
After saying that, Farrell raised the dagger again. But before he could strike, they heard sirens blaring in the air.
Sadie’s entire body went slack with relief. Thank God! The police had come just in time.
Farrell froze, his eyes growing wide with alarm. How had they gotten here so fast?
His head swiveled, his panicked eyes darting in every direction. The sound of sirens was echoing from all sides. There was no way out.
The realization must have sparked something inside him because he suddenly lunged at Sadie and grabbed her by the arm.
She only had a second to register the murderous intent on his face before she felt the cold steel of the blade pressing against her neck.

“If you want to stay alive, then you’d better do exactly what I say. Now move!”
Sadie was scared out of her mind as it was, not to mention the fact that she was pregnant. She had no strength left to fight.
Farrell had yanked her up so abruptly that it left her feeling dizzy. She would have fallen flat on her face if it weren’t for the deathly grip he had on her. At that point, the team of armed officers had already surrounded the house. Their weapons were drawn as they stormed inside in unison.
But they all stopped in their tracks at the sight that greeted them—a hostage situation.
The lead officer’s face tightened. They had arrived a second too late.
Farrell’s crazed eyes flashed as he screamed, “Back off! If you want her alive, get me a car with a full tank and ten million dollars in cash. Now! Try anything, and she’s dead meat! She will be released once I get my money and I’m safely out of the city!”
The officers shifted on their feet and glanced at each other with trepidation. They were stuck between a rock and a hard place.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1112:
The hostage was too important for them to take risks. They couldn’t afford to screw this up.
How should they handle this?
Just then, a cold, level voice cut through the tension. “Taking her won’t get you anywhere.”
Everyone turned toward the sound. Who was speaking?
Sadie lifted her head, and there he was.
A tall figure emerged from the crowd, his gait calm and steady. His silver mask glinted in the light.
Noah.
Sadie’s hands curled into fists.
He wasn’t fully recovered yet! What was he even doing here? What if something happened to him again?
Her mind spun with worry, this time for the obstinate man who stood in front of her.
Noah’s presence was like an oppressive force that swept across the room.
He slowly walked forward, his gaze locked on Farrell.
The lead officer stepped up to intercept him, his brows drawn into a frown.
“Who are you? This is an active crime scene. It’s off-limits for civilians.”
“Do you think you can decide on behalf of the Wall family?”
The one who spoke was a younger officer, his voice barely loud enough to hear. The woman clutched in Farrell’s grip was no ordinary hostage. She was the chairwoman of Wall Group.
Farrell locked eyes with Noah. That cold stare made something crawl along his spine.
His patience was fraying. Clenching the dagger tighter, he moved it closer to Sadie’s neck.
Sadie could feel a warm trail of blood sliding down her neck.
“Yes or no? Make up your mind. If you wait one more second, I’ll slice her throat wide open!”

Noah turned his head slightly and gave the lead officer a look that said, “I’ve got this.”
He moved forward at a steady pace, stopping three meters in front of Farrell.
“Let her go,” said Noah. “I’m Noah Wall. I own Wall Group. If this is about money, you’re wasting your time. She’s not the one you want.”
Farrell stood stiff, stunned into stillness. His brain refused to catch up with what he had just heard.
Noah Wall? That wasn’t possible. The man was supposed to be dead. So who the hell was standing there?
Noah moved with quiet certainty as he lifted his hand and removed the silver mask. Beneath it was a face so remarkable, it was instantly familiar—the very one that had graced the front pages of finance magazines time and again.
A sudden jolt of recognition swept through the crowd, spreading like a ripple and leaving each person frozen, too stunned to trust what they were seeing. Panic clutched Farrell by the throat. His hand started to shake, and the dagger wobbled in his grip.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1113:
There was no mistaking it now. Noah was alive.
But if that were true, then what did that make Sadie?
Everyone in the Wall family would rally behind Noah instead of her without question.
At this point, holding Sadie hostage meant nothing.
Farrell’s thoughts scattered like broken glass.
He tried to string together a sentence, but his voice cracked as he asked,
“What do you want to do?”
Noah advanced, slow and deliberate, every step filled with certainty.
Sweat poured down Farrell’s temple. Panic hit him hard. He swung the dagger toward Noah, his other arm locking tightly around Sadie’s throat.
“Stay back! One more step and she dies, I swear!”
Noah halted, a half-smile tugging at the corner of his mouth—sharp and unsettling.
His eyes shifted to Sadie. Her face was flushed, terror written all over it. Something flickered in his expression—regret, maybe even guilt.
“Why go after her?” asked Noah. His tone stayed even, but there was a sharp edge buried in it. “Take me instead. Use your head. Wouldn’t controlling the former chairman of Wall Group—who everyone believes is dead—cause a much bigger stir than targeting the one sitting in the seat now? And if this is about revenge—shouldn’t it be me you’re after? I was the one on the operating table that day.”
Farrell looked like he’d been jolted by a live wire. His eyes widened. He was stunned.
Noah had hit a nerve. Sure, keeping Sadie might buy him time or cash. But grabbing Noah? That was a power move. He could cash in bigger—and settle the score with the man who’d ruined his life.
That thought lit something dark in Farrell’s gaze. Greed danced in his eyes, but caution hadn’t left him just yet.
“Jacket off. Now. And walk over nice and slow,” said Farrell, his voice tight with warning.
Noah shifted his eyes toward the officers nearby. The gesture was brief, but clear.
Find your adventure at gα?ησν?sоm (uso de “?” y “о” cirílica)
He gave a small shrug, cold as ever. “Alright.”
With zero hesitation, he peeled off the sleek jacket and let it fall like it didn’t cost more than a month’s salary of an ordinary person.
Across the room, Sadie’s panic flared. Her eyes locked on his, wide with dread. She started shaking her head, her lips trembling.
“No—no way!” It hadn’t been easy for Noah to come back home. His body still hadn’t fully recovered. There was no way she could let him throw himself into danger again.
But Noah met her fear with something calm.
Without missing a beat, he started forward. His movements were steady, controlled. Every step brought him closer to Farrell.
The room went silent. Even the air seemed to hold its breath.

###Chapter 1114:
Then Farrell blinked, fooled by Noah’s slow approach. His tension slipped. His hold on Sadie eased, just slightly.
That was all it took. And in the blink of an eye, the balance shattered.
A sharp glint cut through Noah’s eyes—cold, focused, deadly. Before Farrell could react, Noah lunged forward and locked his hand around the wrist gripping the dagger.
“Ah!” Farrell let out a scream as searing pain shot through his arm. His strength vanished in an instant.
The blade slipped from his fingers and hit the floor with a metallic clatter. Noah didn’t slow down. With ruthless efficiency, he wrenched Farrell’s arm back and slammed him to the floor.
Within seconds, officers rushed over. They dog-piled him without hesitation, forcing him down before he could even think of fighting back.
At last, Sadie let out the breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding.
Almost by instinct, her hand flew to her belly. That was when she felt it—something wet trailing down her leg.
She lowered her gaze. Bright red droplets splattered the polished floor, vivid and horrifying.
Sunlight poured through the windows, harsh and blinding.noveldrama
Dizziness crashed over Sadie, stealing the last of her strength. The floor pitched beneath her, and before she could steady herself, her body gave way and she crumpled.
But she never hit the floor. Warmth caught her mid-fall—arms wrapping around her, steady and strong.
Noah’s breath hitched as he saw the blood soaking through her skirt.
He pulled her into his arms without a word and bolted toward the exit.
“Sadie, stay with me! Don’t you dare close your eyes!”
Twenty minutes later, Noah charged through the emergency room doors like a man possessed, holding Sadie’s limp body close to his chest.
L?tτ chɑρτ?rs ιn glov.
“Doctor! I need a doctor!” he shouted, grabbing the sleeve of the nearest physician. “You have to save her—whatever it takes!”
Startled, the doctor froze for a second before his eyes locked onto Sadie. His expression changed immediately.
Sadie’s skirt was drenched in blood, the vivid red soaking through the fabric—a terrifying mess of urgency and danger.
“Get her into surgery! Move!”
Without missing a beat, he signaled to a nurse. A stretcher rolled in before the order was fully out of his mouth.
They transferred Sadie gently, her skin ghost-pale, beads of cold sweat clinging to her forehead.
Noah stood stiff as stone, watching helplessly as they wheeled her away.
The operating room doors slammed shut with a hollow bang.

###Chapter 1115:
Noah started pacing, tension radiating off him like heat from a fire.
When he had arrived at Myrtlewood Estate earlier, he hadn’t found Sadie, and dread had clawed at his chest.noveldrama
After what happened to Sharon, he’d feared Sadie might do something desperate.
That fear had driven him straight to Wall Manor—no calls, no delay, just instinct.
And he’d arrived just in time to witness Farrell’s cruelty unfold.
Noah’s fists curled tight at his sides.
Every part of this—every bruise, every drop of blood—was on him. He’d failed her. Again.
Out of nowhere, a stabbing pain split through his skull, sharp and relentless, as if needles were digging into his brain.
Flashes came, jagged and broken—unfamiliar yet hauntingly familiar.
That same hallway. Those same doors. The same unbearable helplessness.
He’d seen Sadie vanish behind those doors before. He’d felt this fear before. And back then, just like now, he didn’t know if she’d make it.
He reached for the memories like someone fumbling in the dark, but each one slipped through his grasp before it could take form.
A sharp pain pulsed behind his eyes. His hands flew to his head, and his entire body began to tremble.
Why was it all still a blur? Why couldn’t he remember?
A sudden burst of footsteps echoed down the hallway. Alex came around the corner fast, his jaw clenched, his expression hard with panic.
One glance told him everything. Noah was slumped against the wall, pale and shaking, and the glowing red light above the operating doors said the rest.
Rage surged through him like dry brush catching fire. He didn’t hesitate. He marched straight up to Noah, grabbed him by the collar, and threw a punch straight into his face.
“This is your fault! She’s in there because of you!” he shouted. “Ever since you came back, her life’s been nothing but chaos. You should’ve just stayed gone!”
Noah’s back hit the wall hard. Blood smeared the corner of his mouth as he slumped.
I@te$t ￠#@pter$ In g@!novel$.c0m
He wiped it away slowly, his eyes turning dark and sharp.
Without a word, he stepped forward and returned the punch, landing squarely on Alex’s jaw.
“You think you have the right to stand there and preach? What gives you the right to say anything at all? You claim to love Sadie, and yet you got tangled up with Briley? That’s how you show love?”
Alex couldn’t get a single word out. His face burned, draining of color one second and flaring up the next.
He couldn’t deny how badly he’d handled things with Briley. But no matter how messy it got, what he felt for Sadie had always been real.
Before chaos could spiral out of control, the operating room doors slammed open, and a doctor hurried out.

###Chapter 1116:
“She’s lost a significant amount of blood,” he said quickly. “Her condition was already fragile before, and whatever happened today only made it worse. We’re likely going to lose the baby.”
The words landed like a hammer to Noah’s chest. His vision blurred around the edges.
He opened his mouth, but nothing came. When the sound finally escaped, it was low, scratchy, and broken.
“What about Sadie? Can she pull through?”
A shadow crossed the doctor’s face. “We’re still doing everything possible.”
Noah’s stomach sank. His hands curled into fists at his sides, the skin stretched taut over his knuckles.
With a heavy breath, the doctor nodded at a nearby nurse. She handed him a clipboard without a word.
“This is the consent form for an emergency termination. We can’t afford to delay. If we do, we might lose her too.”
The sentence knocked the air out of Noah.
His fingers reached for the clipboard, but it might as well have been a block of iron.noveldrama
Signing meant letting go. It meant giving up his child. That choice felt colder than death.
The hesitation in his eyes didn’t go unnoticed. The doctor’s voice sharpened with urgency.
“Sir, please. We’re out of time. If we wait any longer, she might not make it either!”
Noah’s hands were clenched so tightly, the veins bulged like cords beneath his skin.
There was no escaping it. He had to sign.
Drawing on what little strength he had left, he picked up the pen. His grip shook as he scrawled his name across the line.
The doctor gave a short, relieved nod, snatched the clipboard, and disappeared through the operating room doors. They snapped shut behind him with a quiet thud.
Every tale finds a home at g?lnσνs?com
Questions still burned on Noah’s tongue, but the moment had already slipped away.
His knees gave out, and he slid down the wall like someone hit by a wave.
From a short distance away, Alex stood motionless, taking it all in.
So Sadie was pregnant again. And this time… the baby was also Noah’s?
The truth settled like a rock in Alex’s chest. No matter how long he’d known her, no matter what they’d been through, Sadie’s heart had always leaned toward one man.
A crooked smile twisted Alex’s lips. It wasn’t joy—it was bitter, hollow, and full of resignation.
He didn’t even remember walking out of the hospital. The streets blurred around him as he drifted like a ghost with nowhere to go.
Six years. That was how long he’d stood by her—through breakdowns, rebuilding, and all the chaos of running Wall Group.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1117:
Yet when it came down to it, the one who held her heart had always been Noah. All those six years he’d spent by her side couldn’t hold a candle to the return of a man thought to be gone forever.
How was Alex supposed to make peace with that?
A sleek black sedan slid to a stop just ahead of him, its engine barely making a sound.
The tinted window lowered inch by inch, and behind it sat a woman with large sunglasses and a sly curve to her crimson lips.
“Mr. Howe, how about we sit down and talk things over?”
At the sound of her voice, Alex stiffened. His expression hardened, his eyes turning to ice.
Hailey? Of all people, why her—and why now?
“We have nothing to say to each other,” he said, his voice sharp and flat.
Without waiting for a reply, he turned on his heel to leave.
Unbothered, Hailey stayed composed. Her voice remained even. “Mr. Howe, you’ve chased after Ms. Hudson for years. And now you’re just going to watch her go back to Noah? Carry his children? That’s how you plan to end it?”
Those words stopped Alex cold. Every syllable cut deep, striking nerves he thought he’d buried.
His shoulders tensed. Slowly, he turned to face Hailey, shadows creeping into his gaze. “What exactly are you getting at?”
Her smile stretched wider, slow and deliberate. “This sidewalk isn’t the right place for this kind of talk. Let’s go somewhere quiet.”
For a beat, Alex didn’t move.
He knew what Hailey was—clever, ruthless, and dangerous. Getting involved with her was like handing matches to a wildfire.
But she’d found the weak spot. She knew where to aim.
A few seconds passed before he yanked open the car door and slid inside.
Let your mind wander with g?lnσν?s﹒
The vehicle rolled forward without a word.
Thirty minutes later, it slowed to a stop in a neighborhood long forgotten by time.noveldrama
Run-down houses stretched out in every direction, their walls cracked and sinking with age.
Alex shot Hailey a look, his eyes narrowing with dry amusement.
“Ms. Burgess, when did life knock you down this far?”
The dig hit its mark. Hailey’s jaw tensed, her smile faltering for a split second. It always came back to Sadie. If that woman hadn’t wrecked her carefully laid plans, she wouldn’t be stuck hiding in this pitiful corner of the city.
Burying the venom rising in her throat, Hailey pulled her lips into a forced, brittle smile.
“This way, Mr. Howe.”
She led Alex toward the small, unimpressive house without waiting for a response.
.

###Chapter 1118:noveldrama
Inside, the dimness thickened. The air hung heavy, musty with stillness. Alex scanned the room with practiced eyes. His gaze landed on the worn-out sofa tucked in the corner.
Averi was there, lying still, eyes closed, his face pale but peaceful.
Alex’s chest seized up. His pupils shrank with shock.
It made perfect sense now why his men had flagged so much movement from the Wall family in the past day. They hadn’t just stirred—they’d thrown everything they had into motion, and even the Castro family appeared to have backed them with a sizable force.
Back then, he couldn’t figure it out. He’d been left guessing what had set off all the noise.
But seeing Averi here told him everything—Hailey had kidnapped him. The chaos outside was simply the aftermath.
Without hesitation, Alex stepped forward and knelt beside the boy. He reached out to check for breath.
The soft rhythm of Averi’s breathing calmed the storm inside him—just a little. Still alive. Just sleeping.
Straightening slowly, Alex turned to face Hailey. His eyes had turned to ice, his fury quiet but lethal.
In a flash, he lunged and seized her throat, his grip iron-strong.
“You laid a hand on Averi? Hailey, you’re pushing your luck way too far!” His tone dripped with threat, each word heavier than the last.
Hailey gasped, fighting to breathe as his grip tightened.
“Mr. Howe, don’t you think you are overreacting?”
“That kid—yeah, he’s Sadie’s, but—don’t forget—he’s Noah’s flesh and blood too!”
The moment the words left Hailey’s mouth, Alex’s grip tightened.
He didn’t care who Averi’s father was. He’d watched the boy learn to walk, cry through nightmares, and laugh over nothing. That made him family.
And to Sadie, Averi was everything.
Hailey hadn’t just crossed a line—she’d obliterated it. Laying a hand on a child that young? Unforgivable.
Gasping, Hailey thrashed under his hold, her eyes starting to roll back. Even on the verge of blacking out, she forced the words past her throat.
“Mr. Howe… even if you kill me… nothing changes. This place? It’s mine. My people are outside. I’m not bluffing. I’m trying to be honest. I want to work with you.”
Alex’s expression darkened, colder than steel in winter. Without saying a word, his gaze swept the room.
It wasn’t a big space, but his instincts screamed. The moment he stepped inside, he knew—eyes were watching. They had him boxed in.
He hadn’t brought any of his men. If this turned into a standoff, he was the one cornered.
And more than that, he couldn’t afford to put Averi at risk.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1119:
After a brief pause, he released Hailey. His hand fell away.
Hailey stumbled back, bent over coughing, struggling to catch her breath. Without a word, Alex pulled a handkerchief from his coat and wiped his palm like he was cleaning away something disgusting.
Then his eyes locked on hers.
“Cut the games, Hailey. Tell me what it is you’re really after.”
A low, bitter laugh slipped from Hailey’s throat.
“Mr. Howe, you’re after Sadie. As for me, I’ve only ever had eyes for Noah. We’re not standing in each other’s path. In fact, I’ve got a way to make Noah wipe Sadie from his memory completely.”
She leaned in slightly, her red lips curling with mischief.
“And on top of that… I’m carrying his child. So tell me, Mr. Howe, why not lend me a little support?”
Stunned, Alex stood still, his face unreadable for a beat.
Hailey had already gone as far as kidnapping Averi. God only knew what lines she’d be willing to cross next.
And if Sadie ended up hurt—if she paid the price for Hailey’s obsession—he wasn’t sure he’d be able to live with it. His jaw clenched. Doubt flickered in his eyes.
Hailey caught it. Her grin stretched, smooth and slow.
“You’re really going to just stand there while Noah and Sadie skip off into the sunset? Let me remind you—didn’t the Sanchez Group come out of nowhere and blindside your company recently?”
That dug in deeper. Alex’s brow furrowed. He turned sharply, tension snapping into his voice. “What are you trying to say?”
Something about the Sanchez Group had felt wrong from the start. The Howe and Sanchez Groups had always kept their distance, no friction, no overlap. Then out of the blue, Sanchez Group struck hard—too hard, like they had something to prove.
He’d launched his own investigation. Days of digging… and still, nothing added up.
But now, the smug curve of Hailey’s mouth told him she knew exactly what he didn’t.
Lɑττ cнαρτ?rs n glov?l.o
“I’m still the Burgess family’s heiress, whether people like it or not. Noah might be the one calling the shots these days, but I haven’t exactly been left in the dark. Word has it you’ve been pretty cozy with Sadie lately. And right around that same time, Jack was seen delivering a little something to the Sanchez Group on Noah’s behalf. You’re smart enough to connect the dots, aren’t you?”
That stopped Alex cold. The realization struck hard and fast. So it had been Noah all along.
Hailey caught the shift in Alex’s expression. Like a shark sensing blood, she moved in closer.noveldrama
“If we work together, Mr. Howe, you won’t just walk away with Sadie. The Howe Group hasn’t been performing well in the past two years. But once Noah and I seize control of the Wall Group, we’ll throw our full support behind you. All I need from you is one thing—lure Noah out.”
Her smirk vanished, giving way to a sharp, icy expression.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1120:
“There’s a full-scale manhunt out there. Everyone’s hunting me down. Just showing up at the hospital to find you was a massive risk. And as for Noah? He’s cut me off completely. I’ve got no one else to turn to. Like it or not, you’re all I’ve got.”
Alex gave a short, bitter laugh. “So that’s what this is. You can’t get to Noah, and now you expect me to help you out.”
His chest tightened with fury, the heat of it rising until his hatred for Noah flared up again.
Meanwhile, Hailey’s words tempted him. The chance to finally have Sadie… it was impossible to ignore.
His fingers curled into a tight fist as he weighed the offer in silence.
“I’ll think about it,” he said finally, his voice low. “But if you want me on your side, Ms. Burgess, prove you’re not playing games.”
His gaze drifted toward the sofa, settling on the small, sleeping figure on it.
That single glance was enough. Hailey stiffened, instantly catching his meaning.noveldrama
To her, Averi had never been more than leverage.
Forcing a smile, she nodded, though her voice faltered.
“Fine. Take him. But think about what I said, Mr. Howe.”
Alex didn’t respond. He crossed the room, bent down, and lifted the child with deliberate care. Without sparing her another word, he turned and walked out, the sound of his footsteps echoing into the hallway.
The heavy iron door groaned before slamming shut behind him.
In the bedroom, a shadow stirred.
Forest emerged from the darkness, his face twisted in disbelief.
“You just let him walk off with the kid?” he snapped. “That’s Noah’s only heir. Letting him live won’t get us anywhere!”
Hailey didn’t flinch. Her hands curled tightly at her sides as she turned toward him, her expression ice-cold and sharp as glass.
“That boy’s days are numbered,” she said flatly. “Right now, our focus is making sure Alex agrees to work with us and also takes the blame later.”

Thirty minutes later, Alex rushed through the hospital’s emergency room doors, cradling Averi in his arms.
Perspiration beaded across his forehead, and his breath came in sharp, irregular bursts.
He carefully settled Averi onto the crisp white sheets of an unoccupied bed.
When the doctor hurried toward them, Alex’s voice cut through the ambient noise with unwavering authority.
“I need you to run a complete examination. Check everything.”
Relief washed over Alex like a cool wave, though he knew this reprieve might prove fleeting.
Averi was safe—nothing else mattered more in this moment.
The doctor acknowledged him with a brisk nod, retrieved his stethoscope, and began the thorough assessment.

###Chapter 1121:noveldrama
Alex observed the proceedings until satisfaction replaced anxiety in his chest, then released a quiet breath of gratitude. His feet carried him swiftly toward the nurses’ station.
“Excuse me, has Sadie Hudson’s surgery concluded? I need to know her room number.” His voice carried the roughness of suppressed emotion and desperate concern.
The nurse glanced up from her paperwork, fingers dancing across the keyboard as she pulled up the patient records.
After a brief pause, her eyes returned to meet his expectant gaze.
“The procedure concluded successfully,” she informed him with professional efficiency. “We’ve transferred her to Room 303.”
Alex offered a hurried word of gratitude before striding purposefully toward the inpatient wing.
He paused outside Room 303, his hand extending toward the firmly sealed door.
Muffled conversations filtered through the barrier—he recognized the familiar cadences of Noah’s voice intertwining with Sadie’s softer tones.
Alex’s hand halted in the space between intention and action. His chest constricted as unnamed emotions churned beneath his ribs like a tempest he couldn’t understand or control.
The familiar sting of arriving second pierced through him. In Sadie’s moments of greatest vulnerability, Noah remained her constant companion, while he stood relegated to the shadows once more.
Minutes ago, consciousness had gradually returned to Sadie, like dawn breaking through heavy clouds.
Her entire frame protested with the intensity of someone who had weathered a devastating hurricane. Each bone sang its own song of agony throughout her battered form.
She attempted to shift position, to elevate herself, but her limbs responded with the sluggish resistance of lead weights.
Gentle pressure from a familiar palm settled against her shoulder, guiding her back toward the pillow’s embrace.
“Please don’t strain yourself. You need to remain still.” Noah’s words emerged rough-edged, yet saturated with tender worry.
Lаtt chɑpt?rs ?n glnοv?ls.ο
Sadie’s eyelids parted with deliberate slowness, the world around her swimming in unfocused patterns.
Without conscious thought, her palm sought the curve of her belly—only to discover an absence that sent ice through her veins.
Her heartbeat stuttered against her ribs as terror clawed its way up her throat with vicious speed.
Moisture gathered behind her lashes before cascading down her cheeks, while her voice trembled with devastating vulnerability.
“My baby… what happened to my baby?”
Noah’s lashes swept downward like protective curtains, casting shadows across his features. He couldn’t summon the courage to face the raw anguish in her stare.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1122:
His avoidance communicated the devastating truth more clearly than words ever could, though Sadie’s heart rejected the unspoken revelation with fierce determination.
The possibility that her child was gone struck her as impossible, unthinkable. Such cruelty couldn’t exist in her reality.noveldrama
Desperation seized control of her movements as she fought against her body’s limitations.
“This isn’t real! I need to see the doctor immediately!”
Noah drew her swiftly against his chest, enveloping her trembling form with protective strength. His chin found the graceful slope where her neck met her…
“Sadie… we’ll have more kids together. You’re not alone in this darkness.”
The dam holding back Sadie’s emotions shattered completely. Her sobs erupted with raw, primal intensity.
“What cruel force allowed this to happen? My precious child…”
Each cry that escaped her throat seemed to carry fragments of her breaking heart, growing in volume as though her very soul was splintering.
Noah’s embrace intensified until his arms bordered on causing discomfort. Every sound of her anguish carved deeper wounds into his conscience. The weight of responsibility crushed against his chest—he had failed to protect what mattered most.
He kissed her hair while tender murmurs fell from his lips like healing balm.
“Sadie, your recovery has to come first right now. We’ll navigate the rest of this storm together when you’re stronger.”
Time stretched endlessly as Sadie wept within the sanctuary of his embrace, her desperate cries gradually diminishing to exhausted whimpers.
Her eyes had transformed into puffy, crimson-edged wounds. The sight sent sharp spikes of agony through Noah’s chest.
She drew in shuddering breaths between the tears, her words still saturated with the thickness of overwhelming grief.
Her fingers closed around Noah’s hand with the desperation of someone clinging to salvation itself, while a fragile spark of possibility illuminated her devastated features.
L?t?st chαpt?rs ιn glovе.?
“Averi… please tell me you found my son.”
Noah’s gaze met hers, his mouth opening as though words waited just beyond his reach.
The precise instant before Noah could respond, hinges whispered their quiet protest as the door yielded to Alex’s entrance.
Alex absorbed the intimate tableau before him—Noah cradling Sadie against the hospital bed’s stark whiteness. Something indefinable passed across his expression before his features composed themselves into practiced neutrality. He approached with measured steps, his tone carrying the unwavering certainty Sadie desperately needed to hear.
“Sadie, Averi is safe. I personally ensured the medical team conducted a comprehensive examination. Your son is fine.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1123:
Noah’s and Sadie’s attention shifted toward him in perfect synchronization. The suffocating tension that had wound itself around Sadie’s ribs finally began to unravel, allowing her lungs to draw deeper breaths.
Air escaped her lips in a prolonged exhale of pure gratitude, while the ghost of a smile—delicate as spun glass—graced her tear-stained features.
“Alex, I can never repay this debt of gratitude.”
Once her breathing steadied into something resembling normalcy, urgent questions tumbled from her lips.
“Tell me where you discovered him. Was he…?”
Alex’s head moved in gentle negation, dismissing her fears with quiet confidence.
“I consider Averi my son, too. I’ve watched him grow up, protected him through every milestone. Sadie, you can rest easy now—I would never let anything happen to him.”
Noah’s expression clouded in response to Alex’s comment.
Almost instinctively, he inched forward just enough to quietly position himself between Sadie and the other man.
When he finally broke the silence, his tone was calm yet commanding, each syllable deliberate.
“I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Howe. I’ll make sure my child personally thanks you sometime soon.”
The undertone was unmistakable. This was no casual courtesy; it was a firm declaration: Averi belonged to him.
How could Alex pretend not to grasp the warning? His long-suppressed resentment burst to life without restraint.
He gave a sharp, humorless chuckle, his voice cutting like a blade.
“Mr. Noel. Or is it Mr. Wall now? You couldn’t keep your family safe. What makes you think you’ve earned the right to say something like that?”
But before the venom could spread further, Sadie spoke—her voice quiet, a little frail, but unwavering.
“I’m exhausted. I need some rest. Alex, you’ve done more than enough already. Please… go home and sleep.”

Though her manner remained courteous, her gaze dropped slightly, her tone cooled by distance. The decision was final.
She wouldn’t accept favors. She wouldn’t carry that weight.
With a slow breath, she turned away, pulled the blanket higher, and shut her eyes—her message clear: this conversation was over.
Alex stiffened. She’d dismissed him. But what about Noah? Was he staying?noveldrama
Noah bent his head slightly, watching Sadie with a softness that flickered briefly across his face.
Then his gaze shifted to Alex—steady, unreadable, but assertive.
“Mr. Howe, if you will.”

###Chapter 1124:
Alex’s hands curled into fists, his knuckles pale from tension.
He lingered, glancing once at Sadie—serene, distant—then at Noah, who stood firm, his presence unshaken.
Finally, Alex exhaled, the frustration heavy in his chest.
There was nothing left to argue. Sadie had made her stance clear.
With stiff movements and bitterness etched in his steps, he turned away.
His retreat echoed faintly down the hall, each footfall growing more distant. A soft click followed—the door closing behind him. Silence settled like dust.
Noah turned around, facing Sadie.noveldrama
Her lashes fluttered faintly, her face still and pale, shadows collecting beneath her eyes.
“Do you want to eat anything? I can have something brought up.” His voice was low, laced with restrained affection.
Sadie’s answer came muffled from beneath the covers.
“You should leave too. I need time to think.”
Noah’s hand paused midair, frozen as he reached to straighten her blanket.
He stood motionless. She wanted him gone as well?
The realization cut deep, an ache blooming in his chest.
He took a steadying breath, his reply barely above a whisper.
“Okay. If you need anything… I’m just a call away.”
His hand dropped slowly, reluctant. He turned off the lamp by her bed, leaving only the soft glow of a wall light behind.
As he crossed the room, his eyes lingered on her—small and still beneath the covers. He stopped more than once, hesitating, then moved on.
But the moment he stepped past the door, he was nearly knocked off balance by someone rushing down the corridor.
It was Blaine—sweaty, rumpled, shirt half-untucked—who came barreling toward him.
“How is Sadie? Is she all right?”
Your escape is on g ? ln σ ν s?com
He gripped Noah’s arm, breath coming in sharp bursts, worry etched deep into every word.
The moment Blaine had learned Farrell had tried to harm Sadie at Wall Manor, he’d abandoned everything—no coat, no delay—and rushed here.
Noah’s brow furrowed, and he gently pushed Blaine’s hand away.
He had a family now. He couldn’t afford misunderstandings—not with Sadie nearby.
Drawing a deep breath, Noah answered quietly, his voice even but heavy.
“She lost the child. Farrell’s been arrested. Sadie survived… but she’s shattered inside.”
Blaine’s eyes narrowed sharply at the statement, a long breath escaping his lungs.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1125:
The pressure crushing his ribs eased—just slightly. The dread that had sat in his throat since he heard the news began to unravel.
As long as Sadie was safe, the rest could wait.
But that sense of calm didn’t last. His features tightened again almost instantly. He brushed moisture from his forehead, his voice low and weighted.
“We’ve gone through almost every district in Jazmah, but there’s still no trace of Averi or Isabel. One spot remains… the urban village.”
Noah’s jaw tensed. When he spoke, his voice bore the strain of fatigue.
“Alex found Averi. He’s okay.”
Blaine blinked, momentarily thrown off. He had dispatched countless teams and scoured every block around the clock with barely any sleep.
And it was Alex who reached Averi first? Really?
Still, at least one life was no longer in danger.
But Isabel hadn’t been found.
“You’ve got to be kidding,” Blaine muttered, eyes going wide.
“Well… that’s at least some good news.”
He released a slow breath, the edge in his shoulders dulling slightly.
“But Isabel is still out there.”
Noah’s brow furrowed. “That urban village—what kind of place is it?”
Blaine answered, “It’s a chaotic spot, stuck between farmland and high-rises. You’ll find every type of person crammed in there. Filthy. Chaotic. Totally off-grid.”
A girl like Hailey—pampered, protected, untouched by the real world—would never end up in a dump like that. She’d retch just walking past it.
“Hailey wouldn’t last five minutes there,” Blaine added. “She’s spent her entire life wrapped in silk.”
Noah’s expression hardened, a glint of ice in his gaze.
The more forgotten a place, the less anyone looked twice.
M ?ρ  ν.
And Hailey? She was running scared. Fear made people unpredictable.
“Often, the worst-looking places offer the best cover,” Noah said, his voice like ice. “Scour it. Leave no corner unchecked. I don’t care how deep you have to dig—bring Hailey to me.”
Blaine gave a determined nod. This wasn’t the moment for second thoughts. “I’ll get on it right away.”
Just before turning to go, he glanced back at Noah, his face a storm of worry and urgency.noveldrama
If his grandfather learned what Sadie had endured—especially the loss of her child—he’d be finished.
“I don’t care who you are. Just… take care of Sadie. If she gets hurt again, my grandpa will destroy me.”
Alex drifted through the streets after leaving the hospital, thoughts spiraling. Evening air brushed his face, but it did nothing to soothe the pressure crushing his heart.
.

###Chapter 1126:
What did Noah have that he lacked?
Six years he’d been by her side. Six long years.
If commitment meant anything, his devotion should have been enough—immovable.
And yet… her gaze, her soul, belonged to someone else.
Noah. Always Noah. Why not him?
A dark idea slithered into Alex’s head like smoke through a crack—slow and poisonous.
If Noah had truly lost every memory… if Hailey had sunk her claws in so deep that he couldn’t escape…
Then maybe—just maybe—Sadie could finally be his. Entirely.
The thought tightened around him like a noose, stealing the breath from his lungs.
And then the guilt struck, harder than the jealousy.
He knew Sadie. Too well. If she ever caught wind of that thought—if she sensed that twisted hope—she’d never look at him the same. They couldn’t even be friends. He’d lose her for good.
Still… Hailey’s words gnawed at him, toxic and relentless.
The craving burned through him, pulling at his mind until it nearly cracked.
He clenched his eyes shut, stumbling as he walked.
Right as he neared the edge of collapse—swamped in envy and regret—rubber screeched against the pavement.
Alex’s head whipped toward the sound.
A sleek vehicle tore down the walkway—no horn, no hesitation.noveldrama
This wasn’t an accident. It was aimed at him.
Headlights blinded him. He winced. His eyes shrank in alarm.

He tried to leap aside—but too late.
Time crawled.
The driver’s face—distorted but visible—wore a cruel, smug grin.
Crash! The blow hit like a demolition hammer.
His body lifted from the ground, tossed like a rag doll onto the concrete.
Blood leaked from his brow, turning the world into smears.
Pain engulfed him instantly—total and consuming, like a wildfire devouring flesh and bone.
Sadie…
His lips moved to whisper her name, but only a ragged breath escaped.
His senses faded fast.
Distant shouts, a scream—none of it felt real. Muffled, like sound underwater.
Everything dimmed.
His body collapsed, limp, broken.

###Chapter 1127:
The car didn’t stop. Not for a second.
It veered sharply and vanished into the night, leaving no trail behind.
Only Alex remained, lying in a pool of blood, surrounded by frozen faces staring in stunned disbelief.
Gasps rippled through the bystanders, who surged forward.
“Isn’t that the CEO of Howe Group?”
“Someone, call an ambulance!”
Across the street, Hailey sipped her drink at a quiet cafe, her lips curled in grim amusement.
She couldn’t afford to let Alex take his time figuring things out.
This brutal shock was crafted to force his hand—compliance through urgency. As paramedics loaded Alex into the vehicle and sped off, she tucked cash beneath her cup, slid on her shades, and exited without a glance back.
The security man stationed at the entryway shadowed her instantly.
“Ma’am, the chauffeur is in hiding, just as instructed. No word will spread.”
Hailey gave a sharp nod. “Well executed. But don’t forget—dead lips never talk.”
The guard stiffened slightly, understanding the veiled instruction. “Understood. I’ll handle it now.”
Hailey’s approval was silent but cold, her gaze hard as flint.
She had sacrificed too much and maneuvered too precisely to allow loose ends. Any threat would be erased—permanently.
At the hospital, Sadie tossed in her sheets, a creeping sense of dread coiling in her chest. Beads of sweat dotted her skin.
In her sleep, a savage vision of a collision tore through her mind—violent, gory, unforgettable.
She bolted upright with a startled gasp.
Breathing hard, she realized she was drenched in sweat.
g?lnσνs﹒o is where stories live
She wrapped her arms around herself, her heart pounding erratically.noveldrama
What was that? Why such horror in her dreams?
Whispers filtered in from the hallway—muddled, indistinct.
Driven by instinct, she threw the blanket aside and stood up in haste.
Her foot slid on the tile, and she stumbled with a cry.
Startled by the commotion, Noah shoved the door open and stormed inside. When he spotted Sadie collapsed on the floor, dread carved deep lines into his expression, and he rushed over.
“Sadie… can you hear me?”
His eyes shifted momentarily, but the worry beneath them lingered.
She clasped his hand for balance, her tone unsteady. “Did something go wrong?” The air was thick with tension, refusing to ease.
Noah faltered, then offered a strained grin. “Honestly, everything is fine.” He gently lifted her from the floor.

###Chapter 1128:
“Averi’s already en route to Myrtlewood Estate. Jack and Breck have things under control. Nothing to stress over.”
Sadie gave a distracted nod, though the discomfort in her chest lingered. Something felt strange. There was something off in Noah’s expression.
With his help, she eased herself onto the mattress again.
“Who was that you were speaking to earlier? I caught some voices.” At that, Noah averted his gaze.
“No, Sadie, it must’ve been your imagination.” His words softened, almost like a lullaby. “You only just regained consciousness. You’re still healing. Get some rest.”
He adjusted the blanket around her gently and pressed his lips to her brow.
As he turned away, her hand suddenly gripped his.
Her stare bored into him. “Please tell me the truth. Is there something you’re keeping from me?”
Noah’s heartbeat quickened, palms clammy. He gave her fingers a reassuring squeeze.
“Sadie, don’t dwell on it. Try to relax and heal.”
Sadie watched him quietly for a moment, the softness in his face unable to hide a deeper truth.
She lowered her gaze and slowly shut her eyes. Perhaps her thoughts were just playing tricks.
Noah stepped into the corridor, pulling the door closed without a sound. Almost immediately, Stan appeared, urgency written all over his face. He approached, his voice cracking.
“Mr. Wall, my boss… he keeps calling for Ms. Hudson. Could she visit him—just briefly?”
Alex’s condition had worsened, and Stan clung to the hope that seeing Sadie might help him survive.
Noah lifted a hand, motioning for silence, his expression darkening.
“Sadie’s health is fragile. The doctor said she needs plenty of rest. She has just drifted off.”

Stan’s face turned pale, his posture crumbling as if the weight of the situation was too much to bear.
“But Mr. Howe’s barely hanging on! He only wants to see Ms. Hudson! Just once!”
Noah’s expression shifted, his gaze turning stormy. Alex had just left the hospital. How on earth was his life already hanging by a thread? A crease formed on Noah’s forehead, uncertainty flashing through him.
“I’m going to check on him,” he said, his words clipped and commanding. “Tell me what really went down. Was it just a crash—or something planned?”
When Noah finally relented, a spark of relief lit up in Stan’s face as he scrambled upright. He cast a quick look toward the shut door but kept quiet. He understood how fragile Sadie’s condition was.
“The one behind the wheel bolted right after impact. We’re throwing everything we have into finding him!”

###Chapter 1129:
Stan trailed after Noah, struggling to match his determined pace. They arrived at the trauma wing. A sharp, sterile scent hung in the air, tinged with the coppery trace of spilled blood.
Suddenly, the ER doors banged open. A doctor emerged in haste, soaked with perspiration and visibly tense.
“He’s hemorrhaging badly. We need to start a transfusion immediately! But we’re nearly out of O-negative. Nearby facilities might help, but the roads are packed. We may not have an hour—he might not last that long!”
Stan felt the words hit like a punch to the chest. His vision swam, knees buckling beneath him. “No… no, sir! Mr. Howe!” he cried out, stumbling toward the entrance, sobs catching in his throat. “If you don’t make it… what am I supposed to do?” His voice cracked under the weight of fear.
Noah’s jaw tightened. He shot Stan a sharp look, annoyance flickering in his eyes. Panic would solve nothing. He turned to the doctor, his voice steady and clear.
“I’m O-negative. Use mine.”
The doctor’s eyes went wide, as if he’d just caught a lifeline.
Stan’s weeping stopped short. He looked up, stunned—caught between disbelief and renewed faith.
No one wasted time asking how the two men were connected. The priority was clear: Alex needed saving.
“Move now!” the doctor barked. “Prep for immediate transfusion!”
Minutes stretched into hours. The crimson light above the double doors glowed steadily, a grim beacon.
After what felt like forever, it finally blinked off. Both Alex and Noah were rolled out and placed in neighboring recovery suites. Stan had stayed put the entire time. Seeing Alex—wan but stable—finally eased the tight grip on his chest.
He exhaled shakily, slumping back against the wall. Alex was safe. That was everything.
Alex stirred weakly. Pain radiated through every nerve as he blinked against the overhead glare. His surroundings slowly came into focus—pale ceiling, unfamiliar walls, the clinical burn of antiseptic thick in the air.
His gaze searched the room, hopeful, then dimmed. His lids dropped partway, disillusionment settling over his features.

His lips, cracked and dry, moved slightly. The words were barely more than a breath. “Sadie… why aren’t you here?”
Stan stood nearby, watching as his employer emerged from unconsciousness, relief blooming in his chest. But when that fragile question broke the silence, his expression faltered. He looked away, the hint of a smile vanishing. “Ms. Hudson… she’s resting. She didn’t come.”
Whatever light remained in Alex’s face vanished. He lay still, eyes slowly closing, casting shadows across his already pale features. That familiar heartache returned—now layered beneath the physical torment, each breath a battle.
She didn’t come. Not even now.
Alex simmered with resentment. He’d danced on the edge of death—and Sadie hadn’t even shown her face.noveldrama

###Chapter 1130:
“Why don’t you just tell your boss Noah intervened? That you didn’t even get to see Sadie?”
A woman’s voice—smooth and laced with sarcasm—cut through the quiet like a scalpel.
Both Stan and Alex flinched, their heads snapping toward the doorway.
Hailey stepped inside with theatrical flair—oversized shades hiding half her expression, a designer mask concealing the rest. The sterile air now carried her signature fragrance, far too lavish for a hospital ward.
Recognition flickered in Stan’s eyes. His jaw tensed as he began to bark a reply. “You—”noveldrama
He didn’t get far. Two suited men, dressed like shadows, emerged behind her. They reached for him in unison—fast, deliberate, precise.
He thrashed, but resistance only made their grip unyielding.
He stood frozen, helpless, as a guard yanked him through the open door without a single word exchanged.
Thud! The door slammed behind him, muting his protests in the corridor.
A heavy stillness settled inside the room.
Hailey lowered herself into the seat beside the mattress with effortless grace. She removed her shades, revealing narrow eyes brimming with unspoken disdain as she examined Alex. His complexion had gone ashen.
“Pathetic.” Her tone was gentle, but the word stung like a blade dragged across raw skin.
“You gave your all, nearly lost your life—and for what? She didn’t even bother to visit.”
Alex remained mute, but his stare hardened into ice.
Unbothered by his frosty glare, Hailey carried on.
“Don’t just blame Noah. If Sadie truly wanted to come, no one could have kept her away. The truth? She’s never really cared. Her heart was always his.”
Each sentence landed like a hammer to the ribs. Beneath the covers, Alex’s fingers clenched tight, the tension whitening his knuckles. His pulse throbbed in his skull.
Your favorite tales are on gα?ησν?sоnn
“Are you done?” he muttered, his voice hoarse with restrained fury.
Hailey gave a faint smirk, her lashes fluttering in mock distress. “Just laying out the facts. But if they sting, I’ll hush. Still… can you really live with that?”
She leaned closer, her voice dipping into something sultry, tainted with allure. “Even from the sidelines, I can tell—you deserve more. You’re throwing yourself away.”
Alex’s chest constricted. He didn’t want to believe it. How could he? Six years—he had stood by Sadie’s side without wavering. So why, the moment Noah reappeared, did all of her attention shift? Why was he—her shield, her guardian, her near-savior—suddenly irrelevant?
Hailey saw it all in his expression. She knew he was on the edge.
Her fingertips grazed his hand, resting softly atop his clenched fist. Her voice dropped again, smooth as velvet and just as dangerous. “Isn’t this what you’ve been hoping for? Sadie—yours alone?”
.
.

###Chapter 1131:
Alex’s head snapped up, his eyes locking with hers. There was a flicker of something wild behind her gaze. His breath grew shallow. He knew he was being manipulated. He knew exactly what this was.
But that craving—that hidden, suppressed hunger—was rising from where he’d buried it. To finally have Sadie. The idea rooted itself like a thorn in his mind.
The conflict in his eyes didn’t go unnoticed. Hailey saw it—he was almost there. After a long silence, the fire in his gaze faded, replaced by something darker, unreadable.
He finally answered, his voice gravelly, “If you ever bring her harm, I’ll make sure you regret it.”
Hailey’s smile grew, wicked satisfaction dancing in her eyes. He was within reach.
“Naturally,” she said brightly. “I just want Noah to myself. As long as Sadie is yours, she’s safe.”
Then, with a playful smirk, she extended her hand. “So—shall we seal it?”
Alex stared at her, unmoved, and didn’t take it.
Hailey didn’t miss a beat. Her grin never wavered as she slowly lowered her arm. She didn’t need his touch. The result was all that mattered.
Hailey had almost reached the exit when she suddenly halted, a cunning smile slowly spreading across her face as she cast a calculating glance back over her shoulder.
“By the way, Mr. Howe, don’t you find the timing of your accident rather—suspiciously convenient? And Noah volunteering to donate blood for you? That seems remarkably generous—especially coming from your romantic rival.”
Alex’s gaze flew upward in sharp alarm, his jaw clenching with incredulous shock as the devastating implications of her words began to sink in. What terrible accusation was she daring to suggest?
Hailey lifted her hands in an elaborate display of feigned innocence, her expression crafted to suggest that the devastating thought had only just blossomed in her mind.
“I’m simply expressing natural curiosity, nothing more than that. The prestigious Howe family commands tremendous influence throughout Jazmah, and you’ve consistently maintained an impeccable reputation for rising above trivial conflicts. Naturally, this unexpected car accident raises some intriguing questions.”
Having delivered her poisonous suggestion, she flashed a triumphant smile and pivoted gracefully toward the exit, her designer heels producing a rhythmic staccato against the polished hospital floor.

She deliberately allowed her toxic implication to linger in the sterile air like toxic smoke, abandoning Alex to wrestle with whatever conclusions his tormented mind might reach. If fortune favored her malicious scheme, he would hurl those dangerous accusations directly at Noah—exactly where she intended them to land.
The moment the door sealed shut with a definitive click behind her retreating figure, Alex’s troubled gaze fell heavily toward the sterile white sheets.
The terrible possibility clawed at his consciousness—could Noah actually be responsible for this? Would Noah truly orchestrate such an elaborate and dangerous deception simply to eliminate him from Sadie’s life?noveldrama

###Chapter 1132:
Yet the blood donation created a puzzling contradiction—until suddenly, the pieces clicked together with chilling clarity. How brilliantly calculated! Donating blood provided the perfect camouflage to deflect any potential suspicion.
A tempestuous whirlwind of contradictory emotions crashed through Alex’s consciousness—burning resentment intertwining with bewildering confusion and gnawing unease. All these feelings twisted together into an agonizing knot that pressed painfully against his chest.
In the adjacent room, Noah gradually emerged from the fog of unconsciousness, his awareness returning piece by careful piece.
A weak cough escaped his throat as he fought against his body’s protests. Muscles trembled with the effort required to push himself upright and maneuver his unsteady legs over the edge of the bed.
Crushing waves of dizziness crashed over him repeatedly, a direct consequence of significant blood loss. Each surge left him feeling dangerously lightheaded and alarmingly unsteady.
At that precise moment, Stan burst through the door and rushed across the room to reach his weakened side. “Mr. Wall, I am grateful. Really.”
Noah’s fingers found his throbbing temples, applying gentle pressure as his complexion remained worryingly pale from the substantial blood transfusion. “I was simply settling an outstanding debt. He rescued Averi. Now we’re even.” His penetrating gaze rose slowly, subtle threads of suspicion beginning to dance beneath the deceptively tranquil surface of his dark eyes.
“What brings you to my bedside? Shouldn’t your primary loyalty be directing you toward your boss instead?”
Stan’s entire posture grew rigid with sudden tension, an unmistakably uncomfortable expression flickering across his usually composed features. He found himself caught in agonizing indecision, uncertain whether revealing Hailey’s calculated visit would be wise—particularly after witnessing the dangerous tempest that had been gathering strength in his boss’s bloodshot eyes earlier. For several heartbeats, he remained suspended in uncertainty.
The sharp trill of Noah’s phone suddenly shattered the tense silence—Jack’s name blazing across the illuminated screen.
Stan, whose keen instincts never failed to read a situation correctly, executed a respectful bow and retreated several measured steps.
“Mr. Wall, I’ll give you privacy for your important call. Should you require anything at all, just speak the word.”
He offered another deferential bow before silently gliding from the room, ensuring the door sealed shut with barely a whisper behind his departing form.
Noah accepted the incoming call with swift efficiency. “What have you discovered?”
Jack’s voice emerged from the speaker, pitched low with the gravity of important news, colored by deep respect.
“Boss, we’ve successfully located Ms. Burgess’s vehicle in the urban village. Mr. Castro has already coordinated with local police authorities to initiate a comprehensive door-to-door search operation.”

###Chapter 1133:
“Excellent progress.” Noah’s voice descended to a more ominous register, his expression hardening into something genuinely menacing. “However, listen carefully—do not eliminate Hailey unless we reach a point where absolutely no alternative exists. My mother’s safety takes precedence over everything else.”
Hailey had proven herself to be utterly contemptible without any shadow of doubt—but his beloved mother’s precious life held infinitely greater value than any desire for revenge.
As long as his mother remained trapped within Hailey’s cruel grasp, he could not permit himself even the smallest tactical error.
“Completely understood, boss,” Jack responded with unwavering certainty. Noah terminated the connection and summoned every ounce of strength to rise, forcing his weakened body into motion. An urgent need to return to Sadie’s side consumed his thoughts completely. She remained vulnerable and isolated, and this knowledge gnawed at him like acid.
The moment his trembling fingers reached for the door handle, Stan appeared once again in the doorway.
“Mr. Wall, perhaps you should consider resting a little longer before attempting to move around.”
Noah’s head shook firmly in negation. “I refuse to rest peacefully while Sadie remains alone and unprotected. I’m returning to her immediately. Inform me the moment Alex’s condition stabilizes.”
Stan hesitated, his troubled expression revealing that he was obviously holding something back.
After what felt like an eternity of internal struggle, he finally spoke. “Mr. Wall… my boss has regained consciousness. He specifically requested a meeting with you.”
Noah’s dark eyebrows furrowed, a sharp line forming as suspicion flared in his calculating mind.
The revelation struck him as deeply peculiar—Alex was requesting his presence? At this particular moment? For what conceivable purpose?
Countless potential scenarios raced through his analytical mind at lightning speed, yet his carefully controlled expression revealed nothing of his internal calculations.
After weighing all possibilities, he delivered a single, decisive nod. “Show me the way.”
ЯE P?ΛTΞ? IИ GΛ?И?VΞ.noveldrama
Perhaps this unexpected opportunity would prove beneficial. Certain volatile situations demanded direct confrontation before they could escalate into something truly catastrophic.
Stan guided Noah through the sterile hospital corridor to the adjacent room. Inside, Alex remained motionless in his hospital bed, his complexion ghostly pale and his demeanor unnaturally subdued.
The atmosphere was thick with the overpowering fragrance of fresh lilies, their sickeningly sweet scent so intensely potent and hauntingly familiar that it immediately set Noah’s already frayed nerves on edge, adding to his discomfort.
The floral scent seemed to saturate every surface in the room, wrapping around his senses like the suffocating embrace of a buried memory that refused to remain forgotten.

###Chapter 1134:
“Mr. Howe, if you have something important to say, speak your mind without delay.”
“Some things just aren’t meant to be yours, no matter how desperately you crave them,” Noah said, his voice carrying the weight of unshakeable certainty. Alex’s already pale lips pressed into a razor-thin line at those words. Beneath the blanket, his hand twisted into a tight fist without him realizing it.
“I nearly died this time. I suppose I have you to thank for that, Mr. Wall.” His voice flowed soft and measured, each syllable carved with deliberate precision. But beneath the calm surface, his tone struck like a needle—sharp, precise, and finding its mark in Noah’s composure.
“Stan is already investigating the cause of the accident. If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving now.”
Noah had barely turned toward the door when Alex’s voice drifted from the hospital bed behind him.
“You saved my life—I owe you a debt. I happened to find Averi in the urban village. While escaping with him, I stumbled upon this.”
Alex slowly raised his hand, revealing a cufflink resting in his palm like a small, precious secret.noveldrama
Noah’s pupils contracted instantly. The piece was unmistakable—one of his mother’s treasured cufflinks.
He froze for a heartbeat, then his hand moved instinctively to claim it. “Why didn’t you mention this sooner?” His eyes remained fixed on Alex, guarded and heavy with suspicion.
Alex merely shrugged, his expression painted with carefully crafted innocence. “I forgot. But that place… it reeked of TNT. The smell was suffocating. If you’re sending anyone in, you’d better exercise extreme caution.”
Noah’s eyes widened, disbelief sweeping across his features. Gripping the cufflink tightly, he found his thoughts scattering like leaves in a storm. His mother was in danger! Without another word, he spun on his heel and charged out of the room.
Moments later, the door creaked open, and Stan peered in cautiously. He had been waiting outside, restless but unwilling to interrupt the tense exchange.
“Mr. Howe, just now… Mr. Wall—he appeared shaken. Did something happen?” A flicker of something unreadable danced through Alex’s eyes.
He told Stan not to concern himself with the matter.
Don’t miss out gα?ησνls?c?m
“Station people to monitor the urban village. Report anything unusual immediately.”
Though puzzled, Stan nodded immediately and hurried off to execute the order. His boss’s thoughts were becoming increasingly impenetrable.
Outside, Noah slid into the sleek black car waiting by the curb. The moment he started the engine, he dialed Jack’s number. It rang endlessly, but no one answered.
“Damn it!” Noah slammed his fist against the steering wheel, veins standing out like cords on the back of his hand.
He had underestimated Hailey’s madness. She had actually dared to use TNT. But then, another thought struck him—what the hell was Alex doing in that urban village in the first place? And that overwhelming scent of lilies back in the hospital room… If memory served him correctly, that was Hailey’s signature perfume. And Alex had just conveniently happened to rescue Averi?
.
.
.
###Chapter 1135:
It was all too neat. Too convenient. Too damn suspicious.
Then, abruptly, Noah’s phone buzzed to life. Jack’s name flashed on the screen. He snatched it up without hesitation.
“Sorry, boss. I was coordinating the operation—I missed your call,” Jack said, his voice tight with underlying tension.
“Give me an update.”
Jack was startled to hear the urgency crackling in Noah’s voice.
“Everything appears normal. We’re following your orders and sweeping the area.”
“Anything unusual? Has anyone reported the smell of explosives? TNT?”
Jack’s confusion deepened. He couldn’t make sense of Noah’s sudden alarm about explosives.
Before he could reply, Blaine—who had materialized beside him—seized the phone.
“What’s going on? TNT? What the hell is this about?” Blaine demanded, his words crackling with urgency.
Noah wrestled his voice into a steadier tone.
“Alex said that the location where he discovered Averi reeked of TNT.” The urgency crackled through his voice as he barked out commands. “Don’t take any chances.”
“With this one. Get backup rolling to your position immediately.” His breathing quickened as he calculated the distance. “Clear everyone from that area right now—I’m still twenty minutes from reaching you.”
“Wait—Jack.” He interrupted himself, and his tone shifted into something cold and razor-sharp. The pause stretched like a taut wire before he continued, “There’s another matter that demands your immediate attention.” His words carried the weight of unspoken consequences. “I need you investigating this the moment we finish talking.”
Twenty minutes later, Noah’s car rolled to a crawling halt at the edge of the urban village.
Blaine was already waiting there, his expression dark as stone, and he approached with swift, urgent steps.
“The situation looks worse than we expected. This could turn deadly faster than we thought.” He dropped his voice to a whisper, his eyes sweeping the area, brow creased with worry. “Why don’t you return and stay with Sadie? I can handle this alone. Nothing will go wrong.”
Noah’s gaze turned steel-hard as he stared toward the shadow-soaked alley stretching before them.
Ltst chptrs in gαlovels.c?m
He shook his head with unwavering resolve. “No.” His mother faced danger now. He had heard how kindly his mother had treated Sadie over the past three years.noveldrama
With Sadie’s delicate condition, even the smallest shock could prove too much for her weakened heart to endure.
This mission had to succeed perfectly—failure would destroy everything he held dear.
Blaine released a weary sigh, recognizing the futility of any argument. He placed a reassuring hand on Noah’s shoulder, the weight of it solid and grounding.
.

###Chapter 1136:
“Stay calm. I’ve reached out to local police—they’re completely backing us.”
Noah nodded curtly and took the pistol Blaine offered. The metal burned cold and unforgiving against his palm.
With practiced precision, he inspected the weapon, then slipped it behind his waistband and marched toward the alley without a moment’s pause.
Blaine fell into step directly behind him.
“We’ve searched the eastern and northern areas—found nothing. The western area remains unexplored. Samuel led a team to the south. We should hear back from him any moment.”
Noah didn’t break stride. He simply gave a terse nod. “Then we go west.”
In a crumbling, unremarkable house hidden deep within the village, Hailey reclined in a groaning wicker chair, her gaze fixed on the surveillance monitor glowing before her.noveldrama
On the screen, Noah and Blaine emerged in sequence, their figures moving into the narrow alley. A cruel smile pulled at the corners of her mouth, while her eyes blazed with predatory focus.
Standing at her side, Forest appeared anything but calm.
The swagger he’d once displayed—born from greed and pride—had completely dissolved, leaving only a trembling shell of a man.
His eyes jumped nervously across the screen, tracking the well-armed operatives. Dread twisted through his chest like a living thing.
This exceeded anything he had imagined.
He wrung his hands together, sweat beading on his palms.
“Hailey, can we really defeat them? They’ve assembled a small army…” Terror had sunk its talons deep into his soul.
If this scheme collapsed, it wouldn’t merely mean defeat—it would spell their complete destruction. The Burgess legacy would vanish forever.
Hailey rotated her head with deliberate slowness, her stare cutting through him like a frozen blade.
Her brows drew together in annoyance. Her voice oozed contempt.
galησνe?s.c?m is your update source
“What’s this? Returning to your spineless habits so soon?”
Forest’s face reddened beneath her withering stare. He parted his lips, but silence was all that emerged because, in his heart, fear ruled him completely.
Hailey released a dismissive snort and returned her attention to the monitor. When she spoke again, her voice carried a bone-deep chill, edged with obsessive determination.
“Calm yourself, Father. Everything continues to unfold precisely as intended.”
With practiced composure, she grasped the radio beside her. “Begin,” she commanded with ice-cold authority.
The instant that word escaped her lips, the surveillance display transformed. From concealed positions, squads dressed in midnight-black combat gear materialized, advancing with ghostly precision.
Within heartbeats, they had surrounded the alley where Noah and Blaine were, creating a flawless snare.
.

###Chapter 1137:
Hailey faced Forest again, her voice now tinged with genuine interest.
“By the way, that backup plan you referenced—what does it involve? Stuart was already captured by Sadie’s people, correct? Without him, who will perform the operation?”
She had never fully trusted this mysterious backup strategy.
Now, her suspicions returned with renewed force.
Forest blinked rapidly, the question yanking him from his spiral of panic.
He cleared his throat and manufactured a cunning smile, attempting to rebuild his shattered confidence.
Instead of responding, he clicked his fingers sharply.
A door near them groaned open at the signal.
From the darkness, a lean figure emerged into the light, his features concealed behind a thick mask.
He approached without any sound, then gradually began stripping the mask from his face.
As his features became visible, Hailey’s eyes sharpened, her expression crumbling into pure astonishment.
“Stuart? Why are you here? I believed Sadie’s team had captured you!” This revelation blindsided her completely.
Forest laughed softly, satisfaction creeping into every weathered line of his features.
“Hailey, the man they seized is Hurst Lawson. He’s Dr. Lawson’s younger brother—missing for years, but a dead ringer.”
Hailey blinked as understanding flooded through her mind. So that explained everything.
She had misjudged her father’s cunning. No wonder he had remained so collected, so confident.
Clearing her throat, she steadied her tone—restoring its smooth, controlled quality.noveldrama
“Dr. Lawson, as long as you perform your role perfectly, your compensation will exceed your expectations.”

Stuart bowed his head slightly, a subtle smile playing across his lips.
“Ms. Burgess, I feel privileged to participate in such groundbreaking work.”
Hailey offered no response. Her focus had already shifted back to the glowing monitor.
Regardless of the price, this time Noah would belong to her completely.
Noah guided his team through a systematic search.
They had already combed through multiple areas, yet discovered nothing of value.
Frustration began to etch itself into the harsh lines of his face.
Noah and Blaine reached a fork in the road.
The alley was dark as it was, but it split further into two paths that stretched into a seemingly endless abyss.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1138:
Noah pulled up short. “Let’s split up. You take that one, and I’ll head this way.”
Blaine gave him a curt nod. He was just as anxious as Noah. Every second they lost put Isabel at greater risk.
“Be careful,” he rasped.
Noah nodded in acknowledgment, then led his half of the group down one direction.
Before long, he noticed that the deeper they went, the narrower the path became. The air was musty yet damp at the same time, and soon they were assaulted by the reek of rot and mildew.
A wave of unease washed over Noah.
Just then, he heard the faint sound of footsteps echoing from up ahead.
Noah halted and raised a hand to signal his men to stop as well.
Everyone held their breath, their eyes peering into the dark expanse before them. The silence was heavy and almost suffocating, but it also made each footfall louder.
After a while, a group of men in black suits emerged from what looked like an even narrower side alley.
The man in front didn’t seem surprised to see Noah and his team there. He even stepped forward and gave Noah a courteous nod.
“Mr. Noel, Ms. Burgess has been expecting you. Please come this way.”
Noah’s brows knitted into a scowl. Just what was Hailey up to this time? He said nothing, nor did he make any move. His mother was in Hailey’s hands at that very moment—he couldn’t afford to make a single misstep.
The other man seemed to sense Noah’s reluctance, but he kept his composure.
“I am merely following Ms. Burgess’s orders,” he said matter-of-factly. “Follow me, and you will see everything for yourself. Then you will understand. Besides, your mother has been waiting for you, too.”
Noah’s jaw tightened at the mention of his mother. His expression darkened, and his hands balled into fists at his sides. “In that case, lead the way,” he said through gritted teeth.
They soon found themselves at the entrance of a quiet, nondescript courtyard. The gate was slightly ajar, its wood weathered and partially eaten by termites. A rusty brass lock hung loosely from its latch.
Noah instructed his men to wait outside, then pushed the gate wider before stepping inside.
The courtyard was small and had clearly been abandoned for many years. It was paved with old stone slabs whose surfaces were worn smooth by time and the elements. Wild grass grew in the spaces between them, particularly dense in the corners.
Hailey stood in the center of the courtyard, clad in white.
Her back was turned to the gate, and in the dim light, she painted quite the solitary figure.
Noah quickly swept his gaze over the courtyard, a cold ball of dread settling in the pit of his stomach.

###Chapter 1139:
“Where is my mother?”noveldrama
Hailey slowly turned at the sound of his voice.
Her face lit up when she saw him, as if she had been waiting for him forever. There was a fervent look in her eyes that sent a chill down Noah’s spine.
“Noah… You’re finally here.” Hailey stepped forward as she spoke and tried to grab his hand.
With a steely expression, Noah took a step back and smoothly deflected her touch.
Hailey’s hand hung awkwardly in the air. Her smile faltered, but only for a brief second. She pulled her arm back and took a deep breath.
She tried to ignore the bitter taste that rose in her mouth. After all this time, after everything that had happened, Noah still kept her at a distance.
Hailey forced a gentle smile and tried for a soft, coaxing tone. “I’m your wife, Noah. That makes Isabel my family. How could I ever hurt her? As a family, we should move forward together… Don’t you agree? Shall we start over?”
Noah didn’t miss the undercurrent of danger in her voice. He shot her a piercing glare.
“My wife is Sadie, no one else. Release my mother, and I’ll send you back to Zupren.”
Hailey’s eyes widened, her smile freezing.
She had gone to such lengths—planned, schemed, waited. And he was expecting her to give up, just like that?
No, that was unacceptable. She would never yield, not even in death.
“Noah, you… How can you be so cruel?” Her voice trembled, and her eyes welled up with tears. “Have you forgotten who saved you three years ago? Who brought you back from the brink of death?”
But Noah’s patience had already snapped. “Keep testing me like this,” he snapped, “and I may not be able to spare you an ounce of mercy.”
All the color drained from Hailey’s face. She gnashed her teeth together and clenched her fists so tightly, her nails digging into her palms.
It finally hit her then—there was no room for her in Noah’s heart. There never had been, and there never would be.
Lαττ ?нαρτ?rs ιn glov?l.om
But if this was the path he chose, then he only had himself to blame for what was coming.
“Noah, too bad! This time, I’m definitely going to win!”
Hailey’s tone snapped mid-sentence, shifting into something wild—tinged with a manic gleam that bordered on hysteria.
A ripple of cold dread spread through Noah’s chest, his instincts flaring in warning.
He inhaled sharply and caught a faint, unusual scent—one he had noticed before, emanating from Hailey. Panic surged. Within seconds, his limbs turned to stone. Numbness spread like wildfire, and his strength deserted him.
He tried to raise his arm—it might as well have been carved from marble. Hailey’s eyes sparkled as she watched the realization settle across his face. A slow, victorious smile curved her lips.

###Chapter 1140:
She stepped closer, her movements deliberate, and grazed his cheek with fingers as light as air, her gaze brimming with obsession.
“Noah, just relax. Everything’s fine,” she whispered sweetly. “I won’t hurt you.” Her voice was soothing, like a lullaby on a breeze—serene on the surface, but steeped in a seductive menace impossible to escape.
Meanwhile, Sadie lay restless in her hospital bed, an uneasy weight pressing down on her chest.
No matter how many times she shifted or rearranged the pillows, sleep remained just out of reach—taunting her.
With a frustrated sigh, she sat up, clutching her chest as a faint, stabbing pain pulsed beneath her ribs.
It wasn’t just discomfort—it was a warning, sharp, oppressive, and suffocating, as though her lungs had forgotten how to work.
The last time she’d felt this same heavy dread was the day Noah’s car spun off the road—the day he slipped into a coma.
That afternoon had begun with her gut twisting in quiet, merciless agony. Without thinking, Sadie grabbed her phone and dialed his number with trembling fingers.
A cold, robotic voice greeted her instead, informing her the call couldn’t be connected.
The silence on the other end stretched like an endless tunnel.
Panic exploded in her chest. She leapt from the bed, not even bothering to put on her shoes.
The icy tile sliced into her bare feet like tiny knives, but she didn’t care.
The hallway outside was deserted. Noah wasn’t there.
But he had promised he’d never leave her side.
Then, out of the stillness, a nurse passed by, pushing a cart that rattled softly in the silence.
Sadie rushed toward the nurse, trying to steady the tremble in her voice. “Do you know where the man who was with me earlier is?”

The nurse paused, her brow creasing as she searched her memory. Then she said that he had left about an hour ago, but she had no idea where he had gone.
“He left? Just like that? Without a word?” Why hadn’t he told her? Sadie stood motionless, as if her feet had turned to stone.noveldrama
She swallowed hard, forcing a brittle smile that barely held together. “Alright, thanks.”
With a brief nod, the nurse continued on, the soft squeak of the cart’s wheels fading into the emptiness of the hallway.
Sadie pressed herself against the cold wall, the chill biting through her hospital gown.
Her legs wobbled beneath her, drained of strength, like she might collapse at any second.
It felt like something vital had been ripped from her chest. Was Noah in danger again?

###Chapter 1141:
The thought tightened around her ribs, suffocating and relentless, like thorned vines wrapping tighter with each breath.
She reached for her phone with trembling hands and dialed Samuel’s number.
Busy.
What? Even Samuel?
A cold sweat broke across her brow, and her pulse thundered in her ears. The silence pressed in like a storm about to break.
Then—a voice cut through the stillness, sharp with alarm.
“Sadie? What are you doing out here? And why aren’t you wearing any shoes?” It was Tina.
She approached, clutching a thermos of homemade soup—meant to bring comfort, not to be met with a scene like this.
One look at Sadie—ashen-faced, barefoot, and visibly shaking—and Tina’s concern spiked. She rushed forward instinctively.
Sadie didn’t bother with an explanation. She seized Tina’s hand, her fingers icy to the touch.
“Tina, track Patrick’s phone. Now. I need to know where he is,” she said, her voice raw and trembling.
“Once you’ve got a location, alert our people. I want everyone moving. Immediately.”
Tina blinked, stunned. What was going on? Why the urgency? Had something happened to Patrick?
Before she could voice the questions swirling in her mind, Sadie spoke again, trying to steady herself, though her voice still wavered.
“No time for questions. Just do it.”
The pressure in Sadie’s chest was growing heavier by the second, suffocating her.
Tina looked into her friend’s eyes—wild with fear but burning with purpose—and felt a sharp pang in her chest.
g?lnσν?s?com is your escape to fiction
Only Noah could shake Sadie like this. Only he had that kind of power over her.
Tina gave a single, resolute nod. “Alright, Sadie. I’m on it.”
Tina came rushing back half an hour later, her forehead glistening with cold sweat. Her breathing was shallow and ragged as she frantically called out,
“Sadie!”
“What did you find out?” Sadie stepped forward, her voice tight with worry.
Tina drew a deep breath before blurting out, “Patrick’s phone’s last ping was ten minutes ago, and it was traced to the urban village!”
The urban village was notorious for its never-ending chaos and lawlessness. It was teeming with all sorts of lowlifes who thrived in its cutthroat environment. Sadie felt her heart sink into a dark abyss. Her hands curled into fists. Why would Noah go to such a place?
But there was no time to ponder or theorize.
She grabbed her coat from the back of the chair and declared, “We’re going to the urban village.”

###Chapter 1142:
Tina stepped in front of her without a second thought, her face lined with worry. “You can’t, Sadie. The doctor said that your body is still weak. You can’t push yourself like this. Why don’t I go there with a team instead? Just stay here and rest.”
But Sadie shook her head. She had made up her mind, and she wasn’t about to waver.
She had already lost Noah once, three years ago, and it had nearly destroyed her.
She might not be able to bear that pain a second time.
She refused to just wait around and do nothing this time, not when she knew there was something she could do to save him.
“No,” Sadie said, her voice soft but ringing with resolve. “I already lost him once; I won’t lose him again.”
Tina stared at Sadie’s pale face, her delicate features set with determination, and knew that there was no use in arguing further.
Once Sadie had made up her mind, no one could do anything to change it, especially when it came to Noah.
Sighing inwardly, Tina stepped aside and let Sadie pass before trailing behind her.
They left the hospital in a hurry. A sleek, black car was already waiting for them at the entrance.
They were just about to approach it when another, streamlined car rolled to a stop right in front of them. The door to the driver’s seat opened, and a tall figure emerged. Nathan.
He was dressed casually, his hair tousled in an effortlessly stylish way. He still had his signature air of carefree nonchalance, but there was a quiet maturity in his demeanor, too—something that wasn’t there before.
Sadie froze in her steps, surprised to see him in Jazmah.
What was he doing here? This was a long way from Beversea.
Nathan’s eyes zeroed in on her, and he immediately caught the desolate look on her face. She looked like the sky had collapsed on her.
He walked around his car and approached Sadie, his brows furrowed in concern. “What’s going on?”

In the past few days, Rodger had been oddly insistent about setting a wedding date for Nathan and Sadie. He had nagged and nagged, telling Nathan to finalize it as soon as possible.
Nathan was swamped with work as it was, and he had barely managed to wrap things up at the company before he traveled to Jazmah to finally discuss the matter with Sadie.
However, on the same day he arrived in Jazmah, he learned that she had been hospitalized.
Nathan’s heart had dropped at the news, and he drove straight to the hospital. He wasn’t expecting to see her rushing out of the hospital as though the devil was at her heels.
Unfortunately for him, Sadie didn’t have the time to hang around and explain the situation to him.noveldrama
“I can’t talk right now,” she said, striding past Nathan’s car to hers. She yanked the car door open and slid into the backseat without another backward glance. Tina followed suit, taking the passenger seat.

###Chapter 1143:
The engine roared to life, and the car shot forward. Soon, it was just a blip in the road, leaving a cloud of dust in its wake.
Nathan was rooted to the spot, utterly bewildered as he stared at the taillights disappearing in the distance. What on earth had just happened?
He jumped back into his car and revved up the engine, then sped down the highway, following closely behind Sadie’s car.
Half an hour later, a convoy of cars arrived at the edge of the urban village. The surroundings were squalid and noisy, just as the rumors said. The air had a damp stench to it, like rotting garbage and decayed wood.
Nathan parked behind Sadie’s car and jogged over to catch up to her.
He looked around at the dilapidated buildings, his brows drawn into a frown. “What on earth are you planning to do in a place like this?”
Sadie’s face was grim. “Noah might be in trouble. His phone was last traced somewhere around here.”
Nathan’s demeanor shifted in an instant, his lazy gaze replaced by one of razor-sharp focus.
So, Noah was in trouble? Nathan didn’t have to ask for more information to understand the gravity of the situation.
He wouldn’t call the man a friend, exactly. If anything, they were something like rivals, but some things were bigger than grudges and competition.
“I see,” he muttered. “Okay. I’ll help you find him.”
Sadie cast a sideways glance at him but said nothing. She signaled her men and led the group deeper into the belly of the beast.
The alleys twisted and turned like a maze, again, just as the stories warned. Musty corridors grew narrow at odd intervals, all of them stretching in every direction with no end in sight.
The further they went, the thicker the stench of mildew and rot became, until they were practically choking on it.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a cry pierced the air.
“Help! Help!” came a voice laced with terror and pain. It sounded faint and broken, but very familiar.
Feel the thrill at g aln ov el s . com
Tina paused in her tracks, a small gasp of disbelief escaping her lips.
That was Blaine’s voice!
What was he doing here? And why was he calling for help?
Sadie had recognized it too. Her head snapped in the direction of the sound, her eyes instantly sharp and alert. She turned slightly and gave Tina a look.
Tina swallowed and nodded. Now wasn’t the time to panic.
Squaring her shoulders, she waved over a handful of capable men. “Follow me,” she ordered quietly.
The group advanced toward the sound, their movements swift and smooth.noveldrama
Much like everything else they had gone through, this alley narrowed the deeper they went. It grew darker as well, until they had no choice but to rely on the dim glow of their phone torches to guide the way.

###Chapter 1144:
Tina’s heart was thundering inside her chest.
Why was Blaine in a place like this? Wasn’t he supposed to be with Noah?
Unless…
A chilling thought struck her like a bolt of lightning. No. It couldn’t be.
Tina shook her head and forced the idea out of her mind.
She picked up her pace, her jaw clenching with renewed determination. The others followed behind her, all on high alert as they surveyed the surroundings with each step they took. They knew all too well how dangerous this area was. The smell of mold and rot grew worse as they inched forward, and before long, they were struggling to breathe properly.
Even so, no one let their guard down. Their vigilant eyes scanned every alcove, every crevice, their ears trained to pick up the faintest sound.noveldrama
Then, a whisper— “There!”
One of the men pointed to a corner up ahead.
A faint light was flickering a few feet away, and with it came low, muffled voices. Tina raised her hand and flicked it forward, signaling the team to proceed with as much stealth as possible.
Her palms were slick with sweat at that point, and her heart was in her throat.
Out of nowhere, a sharp call rang out from one of the guards in the group.
“Tina, look ahead!”
Tina’s gaze jerked up instinctively.
Ahead, just by the mouth of the narrow lane, an eerie cloud had materialized—thick and milky, like a canister had burst open, blinding everything beyond it.
As they approached, faint screams gradually sharpened.
“Help! Somebody help!”
That voice—Blaine’s! He was trapped inside!
A jolt of dread surged through Tina, and she started to rush forward.

“Wait!” A nearby guard grabbed her elbow. “We have no clue what’s going on in there. Charging in blindly could be suicide!”
Tina froze, her breath uneven, thoughts racing.
He had a point. Recklessness could cost lives.
Her eyes darted around—then stopped on a red fire hydrant tucked beside a trash bin.
That was it. A spark lit in her eyes, and she strode over.
“Quick, help me with this!”
The bodyguards hesitated for a second but, seeing her determined expression, quickly moved.
Together, they wrestled the hydrant open. Tina seized the hose, twisted the release valve, and a jet of water roared out, slicing into the thick fog.
The dense cloud began to shred under the force, thinning visibly.
Just then, a faint voice echoed from deep within.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1145:
“Hey! Knock it off! You’re gonna injure us!”
Tina shot a glance at the bodyguard beside her.
He rushed to shut the valve, the stream dying with a sharp hiss.
Tina dropped the hose and darted toward the now-cleared alley.
As the fog lifted, the scene unfolded—Blaine and his bodyguards, soaked to the bone, sprawled awkwardly on the pavement.
Wiping water from his brow, Blaine grimaced, droplets tracing his jawline. “Of course. Knew today would be a disaster. Who the hell planned this?” he muttered bitterly.
Tina exhaled when she saw him looking miserable but unharmed. Her chest finally loosened.
Then it hit her—maybe that water blast had been a bit much.
She cleared her throat, stood straighter, and slipped into her usual icy, executive demeanor. “Mr. Castro, are you alright?”
The already slick pavement now gleamed under the added flood, slick and treacherous.
In her heels, she navigated the slippery ground cautiously.noveldrama
Just as she neared him, her foot gave way. “Ah!” Blaine had started rising when he saw her lurch forward.
On instinct, he lunged and caught her mid-fall.
She landed squarely against him, far closer than either expected.
The guards averted their eyes with awkwardness—some gave low chuckles, others studied the clouds.
Blaine stiffened. The comfort of Tina’s embrace, the faint trace of her fragrance—it threw him completely off balance. His pulse faltered, and to his astonishment, heat bloomed across his face.
He arched an eyebrow, a crooked grin forming. “Well, look at you… launching yourself at me? I mean, I get it, I’m irresistible—but that was gutsy.” Before he could push further, Tina snapped to her senses.
Embarrassed and irritated, she glared at him and struck his cheek.
Reeling from the hit, he blinked as she hurried away, her face glowing like a ripe tomato.
gα?ησν?s?com, home to unforgettable stories
Blaine touched his skin, dumbfounded. Where had that even come from? No signal, no warning—just impact.
Tina hastily adjusted her outfit, her tone stiff and businesslike as she regained control.
“Mr. Castro, stand up. We have to move. Ms. Hudson and Mr. Higgins already went to save Mr. Noel.”
The moment she spoke those names, Blaine’s bruised ego evaporated. He sprang to his feet.
“Wait—what?” His eyes widened. “Sadie’s here? I thought she was still recovering!”
Watching him snap back into action, Tina let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1146:
But when Sadie’s name hung in the air, her calm faltered. Concern etched her face, and her reply came out hushed.
“She tried to contact Mr. Noel. When he didn’t answer, she feared the worst.”
“Traced Mr. Noel’s final phone signal here—to No. 301, buried deep in this maze of crumbling buildings. I… I failed to stop Sadie.”
Tina’s voice cracked and faded to a whisper as moisture gathered in her eyes, threatening to spill over.
A crushing weight settled in Blaine’s chest.
“Enough. We don’t have time for this,” he said, his fingers wrapping around Tina’s wrist with sudden force. “Let’s go.”
Tina offered no resistance. Even with his fingers digging into her wrist, she quickened her steps to match his urgent stride.
At this moment, everything else faded into background noise—only Noah and Sadie mattered.
Several blocks away, Sadie advanced through the shadows, her team following in calculated silence behind her.
Her eyes found the faded numbers painted on the building’s cracked wall—300.
The target lay just ahead: 301, where Noah’s signal had died.
Her hand shot up in a sharp gesture, freezing the team in their tracks.
“Eyes open. We’re almost there.”
The moment she moved to advance, Nathan’s arm swept across her path, blocking her way.
Deep lines creased his forehead as his voice turned steel-hard. “Sadie, I go first. You stay back where it’s safe.”
This went beyond simple worry—it was pure calculation.
Sadie represented far more than another partner. She held the key to everything he had spent years building. The entire Higgins family’s legacy rested on her shoulders. Losing her here would destroy everything he had fought to achieve.
Suddenly, a cutting voice sliced through the tension. “Dad, calm down.” Hailey’s unmistakable tone rang out from somewhere ahead.
The tales you love are at g?lnσνs?c?m
Sadie’s gaze sharpened to razor points in an instant.
Her reflexes kicked in without hesitation, as she yanked Nathan down with her behind a section of collapsed brick and mortar.
The bodyguards flowed into position with practiced precision, melting into the shadows without disturbing so much as a pebble.
Silence descended over the narrow passage like a heavy blanket.
Hailey thrust Forest through the doorway of Building 301, her movements sharp with irritation.
Frustration radiated from every line of her body, her words coming out harsh and abbreviated.
“Blaine’s trapped in my web already. He can barely manage his own problems, let alone pose a threat. Noah is in my hands now—the game’s over. What possible concern could you still have?”
.noveldrama
.
.
###Chapter 1147:
She paused, her tone dropping to something darker and more dangerous. “Follow the plan exactly. Return to Zupren and secure those Burgess Group shares. Everything else falls under my control.”
Three years had passed since Noah pulled the Burgess Group back from certain destruction, claiming the chairman’s seat and driving the company to international prominence.
Now Hailey grasped a fundamental truth with crystal clarity: genuine power never came from borrowing someone else’s strength. She needed to seize it herself. The Burgess Group carried her family’s blood and history. By every right, it belonged under her command.
Relief washed over Forest’s features. His hand found Hailey’s shoulder in a brief, approving touch.
“Watch yourself out here. Keep Noah locked down tight. Never forget what Sadie’s capable of.”
Hailey’s laugh came out as a harsh, dismissive sound.
With Noah finally trapped in her web, Sadie’s skills meant nothing—Noah would never break free from her grip.
Hailey’s eyes dropped to check the time on her wrist.
“Time’s running short. That Zupren flight will start boarding any minute. You need to leave now.”
Forest gave a single nod, keeping his remaining thoughts to himself.
Hailey remained motionless, watching Forest’s retreating figure until the shadows swallowed him completely. Only then did she pivot and stride back through the entrance. The metal gate clanged shut behind her.
Nathan had observed every detail of the exchange. The moment Forest vanished from view, he twisted toward his team, his whisper barely audible. “Move. Take him now.”
The bodyguards flowed into action instantly, gliding toward the alley’s mouth with the silence of drifting smoke.
Nathan swiveled back to face Sadie, allowing the faintest hint of satisfaction to touch his lips.noveldrama
“Sadie, relax. Once we have her father, she’ll dance to our tune. Hailey would never risk his safety.”

Sadie went completely still for one heartbeat. Then something changed in her face. Her gaze turned predatory.
She gave a sharp shake of her head. “That won’t cut it. We divide our forces.” Nathan recognized that look—the wheels in Sadie’s mind had already set a new strategy in motion.
His eyebrow climbed upward as he moved closer, hanging on her every word.
Within the cramped courtyard of Building 301, Hailey walked back and forth in tight circles, moisture slicking her palms despite the cool air. What was taking Stuart so long to complete the operation?
Hailey believed the longer she waited, the more unpredictable things could get. She couldn’t afford to slip up.
.
.

###Chapter 1148:
Hailey walked over to a nearby stone bench. She was just about to sit down to catch her breath when a knock came at the gate.
The sharp sound startled her, and she was instantly on edge.noveldrama
Who could it be?
Her hand instinctively reached for the gun in her waistband. She pulled it out as she slowly crept toward the gate.
“Who is it?” Hailey called out, her voice low and wary.
On the other side, Sadie stood behind Forest, pressing the cold blade of a knife against his lower back. The air was thick with tension.
Forest swallowed audibly. Cold sweat covered his forehead, and as much as he tried to stay calm, his voice still trembled slightly. “It’s me, Hailey. I forgot something. Please open the gate.”
Hailey froze. Her father was back? But why?
She didn’t think twice about it and immediately signaled at the guards posted by the courtyard gate.
They nodded and went on to unlatch the gates.
They flew wide open, and before Hailey could process what was happening, Sadie’s men stormed into the courtyard.
Hailey’s guards were caught off-guard and quickly overpowered.
Hailey herself stumbled back in shock, her hand trembling as she gripped her gun tighter.
How did things turn out this way?
She gaped in disbelief as Sadie stepped into the courtyard while holding Forest at knifepoint.
That bitch! How did she even find this place?
Forest bristled as the cold steel pressed deeper against his skin. “Let us all calm down and settle this peacefully, shall we?”
His voice cracked slightly, and there was desperation in his eyes as he gazed at his daughter. “Save me, Hailey! Please!”
Lose yourself in stories on gα?ησν?s?com
A muscle ticked in Hailey’s jaw. “What do you want, Sadie?” she spat out.
Sadie smirked, her eyes cold as ice. “I believe I should be the one asking you that, Ms. Burgess. What made you go this far, just to hold my husband captive?”
Hailey stiffened, and her eyes flashed warily. How did Sadie know that Noah was here?
“Didn’t your husband die three years ago, Ms. Hudson? What are you talking about? Has grief finally made you delusional?”
Sadie’s patience finally snapped when she heard that. She was done playing around. “Either release Noah, or you will be bringing your father’s corpse home.”
No sooner had she said that than she raised the knife and plunged the blade into Forest’s right shoulder.
“Ah!” Forest cried out in pain as blood soaked his shirt and trickled from his sleeve. Hailey’s eyes grew wide. She wasn’t expecting Sadie to actually strike. What a lunatic!
.
.
.
###Chapter 1149:
But at the same time, Sadie’s unexpected brutality frightened her.
“Ms. Burgess,” Sadie said, her voice cold and menacing. “You would do well not to test me. I’ll give you another chance and count to three. One… Two…”
Forest was shuddering from the pain in his shoulder. He looked back at Sadie, and the lack of emotion in her eyes struck a primal fear in him, unlike anything he had ever known.
All he had foolishly thought that Sadie was merely bluffing. It turned out that she was deadly serious, and he had to pay dearly for that knowledge.
He couldn’t die—not now. He still had a life of luxury to live.
“Hailey! Do as she says! Save me. Please save me! She will kill me, Hailey!”
Hailey’s mind was racing. One side of the scale held her father, the other Noah. One was her family, the other her most coveted prize. If she saved her father, what would happen to Noah? Her entire plan would fall apart, and all her efforts would be in vain.
Hailey’s gaze hardened just as Sadie parted her lips to say the final count. She had made up her mind.noveldrama
Without a word, she raised her gun. But instead of Sadie, Hailey aimed the barrel at her own father.
Bang!
The shot rang out in the courtyard, shocking everyone into silence.
Forest’s face was a mask of disbelief.
Gasping and choking on his own blood, he glanced down at the crimson stain that was rapidly spreading across his chest. His own, beloved daughter had actually shot him.
Sadie couldn’t believe it, either. Her grip loosened, and Forest’s body went limp. He collapsed to the ground, his eyes filled with bitter resentment as they locked on his daughter’s face.
Hailey’s breathing grew heavy. She couldn’t make sense of anything anymore.
She raised her gun again, and this time, it was aimed at Sadie. She couldn’t lose! Not again!
Just as she was about to pull the trigger, Hailey felt a sharp kick land squarely on her back.

Her body pitched forward, hitting the ground hard.
Her cheek scraped against the rough ground, opening a shallow gash. The gun slipped from her hand and slid out of reach.
A team of alert bodyguards rushed in, pressing Hailey down before she could react.
Nathan jogged over from the back wall. “Sadie, are you hurt?”
Pinned to the dirt, Hailey looked dazed. Her hair was a mess, blood staining the corner of her mouth.
She couldn’t make sense of anything. What was happening now?
Nathan glanced down at her—bloodied, furious, humiliated—and let out a low scoff. “You really thought everything was going according to plan? Sadie figured someone as cruel as you wouldn’t even care about their own father. That’s why she had me bring backup through the back wall while you two faced off out front. We’ve already taken control inside. And that so-called Dr. Lawson? Ran like hell, but my guys caught up with him. So do yourself a favor and stop fighting it.”

###Chapter 1150:
The words hit Hailey like a punch in the gut.
She thrashed wildly, red creeping into her eyes.
She’d been so close to winning—she’d even been willing to shoot her own father for it.
She couldn’t give up now. Not when she’d gone this far.
Her eyes burned as she looked toward Forest, who was lying in a pool of blood.
Nathan gave a sharp nod to the guards. “Tie her up. Don’t let her out of your sight.”
He looked down at Forest and clicked his tongue. “This poor bastard… Get him to a hospital. Maybe there’s something left to salvage.”
It was hard to feel sorry for the man. He’d raised a cruel daughter, after all.
Sadie ran forward, her voice tight with panic. “Where’s he? Is he alright?”
She couldn’t stand to hear the answer. Her chest felt tight. Her hands were icy. Nathan looked at her pale face and opened his mouth to speak, but the words didn’t come.
He gave a weak smile and reached out to pat her shoulder. “Sadie, don’t worry.”
Before he could finish, she spun around and bolted into the house.
Nathan’s hand froze midair. He let out a long sigh.
Couldn’t she have let him finish?
Patrick was fine!
Nathan followed after Sadie with a limp, rubbing his right knee.
He’d rushed the wall climb earlier, slipped during the landing, and now his leg still throbbed.
Hero work had its cost.
Back outside, Hailey was in a daze, her expression blank.
Two bodyguards hauled her upright without gentleness.
“Sadie!” Blaine and Tina burst onto the scene.

They came to a full stop when they saw Hailey—tied up, disheveled, cornered.
Blaine’s face darkened instantly.
He cracked his knuckles, jaw tight, every inch of him ready to charge.
What an evil woman.
He’d been raised never to hit a woman—but today, that rule was wearing thin.noveldrama
Tina grabbed his arm. “Let’s check on Sadie and Mr. Noel first. That’s more important.”
Blaine let out a heavy snort and turned toward the house, pulling Tina with him.
An hour later, they brought Noah to Wall Group’s private hospital and settled him in a VIP suite on the top floor.
After running a full set of tests, the doctor stepped out, his expression grim.
“Mr. Wall’s vital functions are stable, no major damage to his organs.”
Sadie’s shoulders dropped slightly with relief. But something still felt off.

###Chapter 1151:
The doctor hesitated. “However… the accident from three years ago left him with traumatic brain injuries and a blood clot, which caused the coma. Our assessment suggests that some form of intense, external stimulation forcibly pulled him out of it.”
“That state… That method comes with high risk. It likely caused additional damage… which explains his current amnesia.”noveldrama
So, that was it.
Sadie stood still, her fingers trembling ever so slightly before she clasped them together to steady herself.
Her voice, when it came, was roughened by emotion. “Is there any way… to help him get his memory back?”
The doctor hesitated, his expression clouding as he adjusted his glasses with a slow, deliberate motion. “To be frank, while our facility is well-equipped with cutting-edge neurological treatments, we’re not the foremost experts in this field. The leading authority in memory restoration lies with Rosewood Hospital in Zupren. They’re globally recognized for cases like Mr. Wall’s.” He paused, glancing at her. “If you want to give him the best possible chance at recovery, I would strongly recommend seeking a consultation there.”
Sadie absorbed his words, her eyes lowering as a quiet sigh escaped her. “I see. Thank you, Doctor.”
The doctor gave a small nod, reminded her of Noah’s need for rest, and then walked away, leaving her in the hush of the corridor.
A beat passed.
Then Blaine stepped forward, hesitant but unable to keep his questions bottled up any longer.
Clearing his throat, he finally spoke, his voice uncertain. “Sadie… how did Noah become Patrick?”
Confusion swirled in his eyes. He had been holding the question back since the moment he knew Patrick was Noah.
Noah was meant to be dead—three years ago.
Tina and Nathan both turned their eyes toward Sadie, their expressions tightening with confusion and anticipation.
Find your imagination at galn ovels ; con
Was there something they didn’t know?
Could there have been more to what happened three years ago?
Sadie let out a soft sigh, her shoulders sagging slightly.
She sank onto the nearby bench, its cold surface grounding her as she gently brushed her bangs away from her eyes. “After Noah’s accident three years ago, things were bad—critical. Isabel acted quickly and quietly had him transferred to…”
Rosewood Hospital in Zupren for emergency treatment. Only a few months later, the hospital reached out… they told me Noah didn’t make it, that despite everything, they lost him. When I flew to Zupren, they handed me an urn. That was it. No answers. Just ashes.”
The memory clearly still stung, her voice catching for a moment before she steadied herself. “I returned home and tried to move on. But three years later, I saw him. Not Noah exactly… someone who looked just like him. He called himself Patrick. He didn’t recognize me, didn’t remember a thing.” Her fingers clenched slightly in her lap. “At first, I thought it was just someone who resembled him. But as time went on, things didn’t add up. The way he moved, small habits, the look in his eyes—I started running little tests. Quietly. Subtle things. And then, I was certain that man was Noah. But his memory… it’s gone. Completely.”

###Chapter 1152:
She paused pensively before adding, “Back then, the Wall Group was not stable.
Coyle and Sutton were circling like vultures, ready to seize control the moment a crack appeared. The entire corporation was in a state of chaos and uncertainty. With Noah suffering from memory loss, the odds were stacked dangerously against him. To protect him—and to stabilize the Wall Group—I had no choice but to keep his true identity hidden for the time being.”
Sadie’s words fell like stones into silent water.
Suddenly, everything made sense.
No wonder Patrick had always seemed oddly familiar.
That calm authority he carried, that intangible aura—it had always belonged to Noah.
He hadn’t changed. He’d simply forgotten who he was.
The realization struck everyone differently, but it hit Nathan like a hammer.
A chill crept down his spine as a thin sheen of sweat broke across his forehead. That man in the hospital room… that was Noah?
He had been vying for Sadie’s attention, not knowing he was up against her legal husband.
No wonder Noah’s eyes back in Beversea had looked like they could cut steel.
That wasn’t just jealousy—it was a warning.
Nathan swallowed hard, his heartbeat thudding in his ears.
Finally, he realized the truth. He had unknowingly provoked the one man who had every right to protect Sadie.noveldrama
Dread crept in.
He didn’t want to think about what his fate would be after what had happened.
Desperate to say something—anything—Nathan cleared his throat. “Well, Sadie,” he said with a faint smile, “My family’s crisis has finally been resolved. Everything’s back on track… so I think it’s time we officially call off that engagement. I’m sorry for all the trouble I caused you.”
Sadie met his gaze, her expression composed. “No need to apologize. I should thank you. If you hadn’t brought your people into that yard through the back wall when you did, we might not have made it out of that mess so smoothly. If the Higgins Group ever finds itself in need, you can count on Wall Group to lend a hand.”
Nathan’s eyes lit up.
In that moment, he truly felt Sadie was a friend he could rely on.
With her words as reassurance, he finally had something solid to bring home to his father.
Just then, hurried footsteps echoed toward them—Samuel had arrived.
Samuel approached, soaked through with sweat, his face twisted in pure panic. “Ms. Hudson, something terrible has happened—an emergency of the worst kind!”
Usually calm and collected, Samuel now looked as if the very ground beneath them was crumbling, sending a shockwave of dread through the corridor. Blaine narrowed his eyes, his voice cutting through the tension. “What happened? Why the panic?”

###Chapter 1153:
Samuel struggled to catch his breath, finally steadying himself enough to speak. “It’s… Hailey. Hailey’s been taken.”
The words crashed over the group like a violent storm, freezing everyone in stunned disbelief.
Who could be brazen enough to pull off such a daring move? To snatch someone right from the clutches of the Wall and Castro families—only a madman could show such recklessness.
Samuel shook his head in desperation, his voice trembling with urgency. “I’ve already dispatched teams to investigate! Our people were escorting Hailey to a secure, hidden location when we ran into Jack and Stan. Just as we were preparing to leave the village, a group of unknown assailants struck—they came in overwhelming numbers and were heavily armed. Our team was caught completely off guard, ambushed!”noveldrama
With every word, Samuel’s face darkened further. “Jack took a brutal hit—he’s been rushed to the hospital for emergency care. And Stan… Stan was taken by those attackers as well.”
Blaine’s temples throbbed with fury, his fists clenched tight like iron.
This was nothing short of a disgrace—under his watch, Hailey had been taken away like a prize from the Wall and Castro families’ very grasp.
Blaine’s gaze burned with resolve. He was determined to unmask the audacity behind this insult.
Seeing his rising wrath, Tina stepped forward cautiously. “Calm down,” she said softly, her delicate brows knitting together in perplexity. “If they came to rescue Hailey, then those must be her people. But why take Stan too? Isn’t he Mr. Howe’s assistant?”
Her words fell like a cold splash of reality, briefly quelling Blaine’s anger.
His expression hardened as reason crept in.
There was something off about this.
Taking Hailey made sense—rescue, after all—but why Stan?

Did he hold some secret they wanted?
Or were they using him as a bargaining chip against the Howe Group? The pieces didn’t quite fit yet, and Blaine’s mind raced to solve the puzzle.
Suddenly, Nathan’s terrified scream shattered the tense silence. “Sadie!” Blaine whipped around just in time to see Sadie’s face drained of color, her body crumpling toward the floor.
Without a second thought, he lunged forward, catching her effortlessly before she could hit the floor, cradling her as if she weighed nothing at all—like a fragile tender in his arms.
His heart hammered wildly as panic surged through him. “Sadie! Someone—get a doctor, now!”
Twenty minutes later, in a sterile hospital room, a doctor removed his stethoscope and reported quietly but firmly, “She fainted from sheer exhaustion and emotional strain. Her body is pushed beyond its limits. Her recent miscarriage has left her dangerously weak. She must avoid any more stress or emotional turmoil. As her family, it’s crucial you ensure she rests completely.”
.

###Chapter 1154:
Blaine absorbed the words, relief washing over him in small waves.
He nodded, his voice steady but heavy. “Thank you, doctor. We’ll take good care of her.”
Once the doctor stepped out, Blaine let out a long breath, then snapped his attention back to business. “How is Isabel holding up? And with Hailey gone, we need eyes on Forest—no more mistakes, no more slips.”
Samuel immediately stepped forward, ready to respond. “Don’t worry, Mr. Castro. Mrs. Wall has been safely escorted back to Wall Manor to recover.
Forest is still in surgery, but the doctors assure us his life isn’t in danger.”
Blaine gave a slow nod, though the crease between his brows deepened.
He began to pace, his expression shadowed with worry. “Contact the police immediately. I want every scrap of surveillance footage from around the village combed through—frame by frame. Leave no stone unturned until we find that wretched woman, Hailey.”
The thought of Hailey roaming free, a ticking time bomb ready to ignite chaos again, gnawed at Blaine’s nerves.
A woman as reckless as Hailey was capable of anything—any extreme. Samuel grasped the urgency and didn’t hesitate. “Yes, Mr. Castro. I’ll get on it right away!”
He turned sharply and hurried out.
Silence fell heavily over the room.
Nathan glanced at his watch, breaking the quiet. “I need to head back to Beversea tonight. The situation with my family is a complete mess—I have to deal with it. If you need anything here, just say the word. I’ll help however I can.”
Blaine looked up, offering a slight nod of acknowledgment.noveldrama
Seeing the gesture, Nathan said no more and quietly exited, eager to leave.
If Noah woke up, who knew how he would deal with him?
Better to retreat to Beversea and stay under the radar.
L€$? tя? ?η glov?l.оm
As for the turmoil in Jazmah, Nathan wanted no part of it.
A soft cough escaped Sadie as she stirred, her eyelids fluttering open with effort.
Blaine and Tina, who had remained stationed nearby, immediately straightened and hurried to her side.
“How are you holding up?” Tina’s voice trembled, her gaze swollen with emotion.
Sadie answered with a faint grin, her expression quietly assuring them she was managing.
She drew a shallow breath, eyes drifting upward. “Any word on Hailey?”
Blaine’s expression darkened, a quiet shake of his head conveying the answer. “I’ve already called in additional support. We’re combing every district. But there’s been a complication—Stan, Mr. Howe’s aide, has been taken too.”
A flicker of shock crossed Sadie’s face.
What? Hailey being taken—sure, that added up. She might’ve been aligned with those people from the start.
But why Stan? He was just Alex’s assistant. What would they gain by snatching him?
.

###Chapter 1155:
Were they planning to use him to pressure Alex—or even the entire Howe family?
Dread pressed against Sadie’s ribs like a vise.
“Hey, hey—don’t push yourself. Breathe, okay?”
Blaine leaned in swiftly, his hand resting lightly on her back.
“Your recovery is what matters now. Don’t let this overwhelm you. Leave the hunt to me. I’ll handle every piece of it.” He turned to Tina with urgency.
“Stay with her nonstop. Call me if anything at all changes.”
Tina gave a vigorous nod, her eyes glassy. “Got it. I’ll look after her.”
Only then did Blaine’s posture ease. He pivoted to leave.noveldrama
But halfway across the room, something gave him pause.
He looked over his shoulder, uncertainty clouding his face.
“There’s something else, Sadie.” He hesitated, his tone dropping.
“Noah’s identity… it’s probably going to be public knowledge soon. With everything happening in the urban village, and now Hailey gone, it’s only a matter of time.”
Before the truth leaks. Employees of Wall Group are already restless. The news that Noah’s alive—and without his memories—will spread fast. You need to brace for it.”
Sadie lowered her gaze, digesting every word.
She understood all too well. Noah’s return would rock the foundation. She’d made the call to keep things discreet—to protect Noah, to stabilize the company.
But now? Chaos within and attacks from outside meant secrecy was no longer viable.
Still, she hadn’t thought the secret would unravel this way—so abruptly, and out of her control.
Blaine, watching her composure, felt some of his anxiety subside.
He’d feared she might break down. But she was steady, present. That gave him hope.
“Try to rest. Don’t wear yourself out thinking. Focus on getting stronger. I’ll bring your favorite dish from Nirvana later.”
Sadie responded with a quiet murmur, barely above a whisper.
Without another word, Blaine stepped out. The door closed behind him with a faint click.
Sadie turned her face toward Tina, who had remained silently by her side. “Tina, help me sit up.”
“Of course.” Tina quickly moved, propping two plush cushions behind Sadie’s back.
“Are you alright? Want something to drink? Need anything?”
Sadie took a moment, piecing together her thoughts.
Eventually, she asked, slow and deliberate, “Remember I told you to ask Samuel to purchase Faron Retreat? Any progress?”
Tina paused, recalling the details.
“Samuel and I went over there and tried to speak with the owner. But the timing was off—he wasn’t around. We only met his relatives. And then… well, everything here spiraled. Noah, the abduction… it all snowballed.” Her voice dwindled to silence.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1156:
“So yeah… we’ve had to hit pause on that for now.”
Sadie nodded slightly, a silent signal of comprehension. There were indeed more pressing matters demanding attention now.
Still, Faron Retreat held deep personal significance.
“Once I’m discharged, I’ll handle the discussion with the owner directly. Please proceed with the arrangements.”
Tina responded with an eager nod. “Understood. I’ll manage everything.”
Sadie’s gaze sharpened as though something else had resurfaced in her mind.noveldrama
“And Tina—within the next few days, try to quietly make contact with Rosewood Hospital in Zupren.”
Tina’s brows furrowed, confusion written all over her face.
That facility was notorious. Years prior, they had claimed Noah had passed away despite every effort made. It nearly tore Sadie apart. And now Sadie was considering reconnecting?
“Sadie, why would we contact that place again?” Tina asked, her tone taut with restrained fury. “They deceived us. They told us Mr. Wall was already—”
Sadie cut her off with a soft sigh. “I get that you’re angry. So am I. But even though Noah’s doing okay physically, his memory loss is still a serious issue. Sure, we have access to cutting-edge care—but Rosewood Hospital is globally renowned for cognitive restoration and brain health. If we want meaningful improvement, they might be essential.” She hesitated, her eyes distant.
“I recall a specialist there—Evan Gill, if memory serves. See if you can find a way to reach him.”
At that moment, the reality struck Tina—Noah’s memories were still missing. And aside from locating Hailey, this mission ranked highest.
If his mind returned, those scheming figures within Wall Group would be powerless.
Tina gave a determined nod. “I’m on it, Sadie. I’ll find a way to reach Dr. Gill.”
Meanwhile, across the city at the Howe family’s estate, Alex brooded in the living room, rage etched into every feature. He was wrapped in gauze, some strips darkened by seeping blood.

An oppressive silence hung over the room.
A bodyguard hovered nearby, eyes downcast, voice hesitant. “Mr. Howe, we got Stan out, too. But… could it attract suspicion? And Jack—don’t stress. Our team made sure he won’t be waking up ever again.”
Alex’s head snapped up, eyes icy and venomous.
He seized a mug from the table and hurled it to the floor, where it exploded into shards.
“Morons!” He was practically shaking with rage.
What a bunch of fools! They’d injured Jack but brought Stan back unscathed.
It was practically an invitation for Noah and Blaine to unravel everything.
The bodyguard recoiled at the eruption, nearly losing his footing.
With a quiver in his tone, he asked, “Mr. Howe… what do we do now?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1157:
Alex’s long, slender fingers drummed along the length of the sofa’s armrest, his eyes glinting with a ruthless kind of resolve.
Things had already gone this far—there was no turning back now. From this point, it was do or die.
And no one could really fault him for what he was about to do next.
Alex slowly rose from the sofa. “Break Stan’s legs and drop him near the urban village. Let it be a warning to Wall Group. And make sure you leave no trace behind.”
The bodyguard’s head jerked up, and he gaped at Alex in disbelief.
Stan had worked for Alex for years. The man was skilled and reliable, and most of all, loyal. How could he be discarded without a second thought?noveldrama
The bodyguard had never seen Alex be this cold or heartless before. He swallowed audibly before venturing, “Mr. Howe… Are you sure about this?”
Alex clenched his fist until his veins were bulging on the back of his hand. This was all Noah’s fault! That bastard had left him no choice!
“Do it. And keep it clean.” After saying that, Alex turned away and paid the bodyguard no further attention.
The latter knew better than to question his boss’s order. He bowed his head and said, “I understand, Mr. Howe.” Then he left to do his bidding.
A few minutes later, an ear-piercing scream rang out from a corner of the manor. It was muffled at first, but the voice still carried down the empty corridor and into the living room.
Alex stood by the window, completely unfazed.
He listened for a while more before making his way to the guest room.
Hailey was curled up on the bed, completely drenched in sweat. She was writhing and groaning with pain. Her face was deathly pale, and she was clutching the bed sheets so tightly that her knuckles had turned white.
A doctor was tending to her, but his expression was grim.
The moment he noticed Alex, he put his stethoscope away and walked over. “Mr. Howe, Ms. Burgess is in distress. It is likely that she is going into premature labor.”
Stay updated with galnσν.c?m
Alex cast an icy glance at the woman in question, then slowly walked to the side of the bed.
Hailey felt as though her stomach was being torn apart from the inside. The pain was excruciating.
In her desperation, she reached out and tried to claw at Alex’s sleeve. She couldn’t muster a coherent sentence, but her eyes were pleading—begging Alex to save her and her child.
Hailey didn’t want to die.
But Alex’s face remained blank.
He brushed her hand off with a flick of his wrist, as if it were something filthy. In his mind, a woman as vicious and cruel as Hailey, who wouldn’t even think twice about shooting her own father, deserved all this suffering and more.
“If you’d stopped for a minute and considered the consequences of your choices, perhaps you wouldn’t be in this situation right now.” Alex’s tone was glacial, as if Hailey were less than human.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1158:
He turned to the doctor and said firmly, “Save the child, no matter what it takes.
As for the mother…” He paused, his lips curling into a sadistic smirk as he continued, “Leave her fate to the gods.”
Without another word or a backward glance, Alex strode out of the room. This child was his final bargaining chip. As for Hailey, she had unfortunately outlived her usefulness.
The doctor no longer had any reason to hesitate. He put on his mask, picked up his scalpel, and began the procedure.
Hailey was trembling as she stared at the blade, her eyes wide with fear and hopelessness, her hair plastered to her skull from all the sweat.
This child was her last hope, but at this point, she was powerless to even save herself.
Roughly two hours passed before the guest room door creaked open again.noveldrama
The doctor emerged, cradling a blood-streaked newborn in his arms. He approached Alex with the utmost caution.
“Mr. Howe, Ms. Burgess delivered a healthy baby boy.”
He paused briefly, then added, “She is still breathing, but her condition is critical.”
Alex’s detached gaze was fixed on the wrinkled child.
The boy squirmed in the doctor’s arms, his tiny limbs flailing, his soft cries choked and barely audible.
Alex’s eyes lingered on him for a minute or two.
Oddly enough, he thought he saw some of Sadie’s features in this child. Something stirred in his heart.
Alex gingerly took the newborn into his arms. It was featherlight and still reeked of blood.
But a smile tugged at Alex’s lips. “Noah’s son is in my hands now. The Wall Group is well within my reach.”
This child was just the leverage he needed to go up against Noah. And he intended to take far more than just the Wall Group.
A hint of madness flashed in Alex’s eyes.
Your next chapter awaits at galnσcom
The best part of it all was the certainty that this child would become the wedge that eventually severed Noah’s connection to Sadie for good.
He was going to make sure that she never returned to Noah’s side again.
He handed the baby to the butler, who had been waiting attentively the entire time. “Clean him up and take care of him. As for his name…” Alex let out a soft, smug chuckle. “He will be called Salex.”
“Yes, Mr. Howe,” the butler said respectfully, bowing slightly before taking the baby away.
At Jazmah Hopevale Hospital, Blaine rushed down the hall, looking disheveled, his forehead dotted with sweat. He stopped in front of the bodyguard stationed at the door of the operating room and asked, “How is Jack doing?”
The bodyguard’s expression was tense, and his eyes were bloodshot. He shook his head before rasping out, “The doctor said that the situation is not looking good.”

###Chapter XXX:
The words hit Blaine like a punch to the gut.noveldrama
Jack was a faithful subordinate, always silent but ever-loyal to Noah. They were all shocked to hear that he was seriously injured, and for what?
Blaine gritted his teeth as a surge of anger rose in his chest.
The bodyguard suddenly became alert as he remembered something. He swiped at his eyes before his tears could fall and pulled a broken phone out of his pocket. The screen was cracked beyond repair, but the phone itself wasn’t smashed.
“Mr. Castro, Jack gave this to me before he passed out. He said it must be handed to Ms. Hudson as soon as possible.”
“What?” Blaine asked, frowning as he took the device.
Did it hold something important?
He pressed the power button. The screen flickered feebly, barely lighting up.
Only half of the display was visible, while the rest was just black.
Blaine squinted his eyes and peered at the text, but the words were blurred. He could only make out a single phrase—”points to Alex.” Alex?
Blaine felt his heart drop. How was Alex involved in all of this?
He brought the phone closer to his face, but just as he was straining to see more of the text, the screen flickered, then died entirely.
“Damn it!” Blaine cursed and jabbed at the power button a few more times, to no avail.
Frustrated, he shoved it back into the bodyguard’s hand. “Find the best repair technician in the city. I don’t care about the costs. Just get this fixed as soon as possible!”
His instincts told him that there was vital information on that phone.
The bodyguard gave a short nod and left to carry out his instructions.
Alone now, Blaine paced up and down the hall, his brows knitted into a tight frown.
The events of that day were still vivid in his mind. Earlier, when they were searching the urban village, Jack had suddenly said he had something urgent he needed to check, and ran off on his own. What exactly had Noah instructed Jack to check?
Ga ln ovels . com fuels your imagination
Blaine’s thoughts were spinning, tangled and chaotic.
For now, there was only one thing he was sure of—he needed to get to the bottom of it, once and for all.
Right then, the operating room doors creaked open.
Without hesitation, Blaine surged forward, reaching out and catching the doctor by the arm.
“Tell me—how’s Jack?” His voice came out sharp and breathless.
The doctor pulled down his mask, sweat still clinging to his brow. His expression said it all before he even spoke.
Shaking his head, he replied grimly, “The damage was extensive—brain bleeding, multiple organ ruptures. We tried, but there was nothing more we could do.”
The words hit Blaine like a sledgehammer. His knees nearly gave out, and his body rocked where he stood.
.

.
###Chapter XXX:
Both hands curled into fists, knuckles pale and tendons straining beneath the skin.
How could those people be so vicious—so completely without conscience?
A sudden, shrill ring sliced through the heavy silence.
Samuel’s name lit up on Blaine’s phone.
Forcing the grief into a box, Blaine picked up the call, his voice raw. “What now?”
“Mr. Castro!” Samuel’s voice cracked with tension. “Bad news. The boardroom is in chaos. Word got out that Mr. Wall is still alive. All the shareholders are demanding answers—they’re all in there now!”
Blaine’s eyes narrowed, his jaw tightening with restrained fury.
The board. Always watching. Always stirring up trouble the moment things turned unstable.
Of course they’d choose today of all days to raise hell.
“I’m on my way,” he said, and ended the call. His gaze shifted to the bodyguard beside him. Voice low and clipped, he said, “Make sure Jack’s well taken care of. Tell me immediately if he wakes up.”
The bodyguard’s eyes were bloodshot, and he nodded without hesitation.noveldrama
Blaine didn’t linger. He turned and strode off with unwavering resolve.
Thirty minutes later, he pulled up outside Wall Group’s towering headquarters. Samuel had been standing by the entrance, and the moment Blaine stepped out of the car, he hurried over with nervous urgency.
As he stepped onto the pavement, Blaine wasted no time. “What’s going on inside?”
Samuel kept close to his side, speaking quickly as if trying to catch up with the weight of everything happening. “It’s a mess in the conference room! The shareholders are furious, demanding Ms. Hudson give an explanation. Some of them even said she should step down. And they’re insisting on seeing Mr. Wall to confirm how he’s doing. Even the old Wall family elders, the ones who seldom show their faces, have turned up—and every single one of them looks absolutely livid.”
A slow, icy smirk tugged at Blaine’s mouth.
Those old bastards, who usually acted like nothing ever concerned them, were suddenly the first to stir the pot the moment things started to go south!
Without another word, he marched into the elevator, his face unreadable, and rode it up to the executive floor.
Explore more fiction on gα?ησν?s?
A moment later, the heavy conference room door flew open with a thunderous kick that echoed down the hall. Instant silence blanketed the room.
The fiery debate among the Wall family’s elders and shareholders came to an abrupt halt, their words catching in their throats.
Eyes widened in recognition as Blaine swept into the room, his stride brisk and his presence undeniable.
Any trace of bravado vanished from their faces like mist under the sun.
A Castro had arrived.
Among the most formidable powerholders in Wall Group, second only to the highest authority, the Castro lineage wasn’t one to provoke carelessly.
.
.
.
###Chapter XXX:
Saying nothing, Blaine moved with calm assurance to the seat beside the head of the long conference table.
Without pause, he slung one leg over the edge of the gleaming mahogany surface, a clear show of disdain for formalities or rank.
His gaze cut across the room like a cold wind, and a sly, contemptuous grin crept onto his face. “What happened? You were practically yelling over each other a second ago. Did you forget this is a boardroom, not some noisy street stall? Or do you all think Wall Group’s reputation doesn’t matter anymore?”
The silence that followed was deafening, the once-defiant stakeholders now subdued, exchanging nervous glances but lacking the courage to be the first to answer.
Silence hung heavy in the meeting room, every moment stretching out painfully. From his seat, Jonah—one of the oldest Wall family members—struggled to his feet, his hand trembling as he steadied himself.
Clearing his throat with deliberate care, he tried to muster the dignity of his years. “Blaine, believe me, we didn’t gather here with any ill will. News has spread that Noah is somehow alive and well. Yet not so long ago, Sadie herself broke the news of his passing. Can someone please tell us what happened? If Noah is really back, we, as the senior members of the Wall family, have every right to demand a proper explanation!”
When Blaine heard this demand, a chill settled in his gaze.
He lowered his foot from the edge of the table with slow, calculated ease and straightened up, his posture tense as he approached Jonah. “Jonah, what exactly are you trying to say here? Surely you’re not suggesting that Sadie kept the truth about Noah being alive a secret just so she could have the chairperson seat at Wall Group to herself?”
This old bastard’s mind must really be slipping with age, Blaine thought.
“If my memory serves me right, when Wall Group was in shambles the last time—no one at the helm, stocks crashing, and chaos closing in from every side—you were the one who gathered a bunch of Wall family members and practically begged Sadie to take control of the company. Funny how fast that’s slipped your mind.”
A flush crept up Jonah’s neck, the sting of those words leaving him speechless. His mouth opened as if to argue, but one look from Blaine made every excuse shrivel on his tongue.
There was no denying it—he had begged for Sadie’s intervention.
g?lnσν?s?com holds stories for every mood
If not for Sadie, Wall Group would have been lost for good.
Yet now, with Noah alive and present, everything was different.
Coldly, Blaine swept his eyes across the assembly of Wall Group’s long-time members, the hint of mockery growing sharper with every word.
“When Wall Group was falling apart, every one of you stayed as far away as possible, too afraid to be dragged into the mess. And now, the moment there’s even a whisper about Mr. Wall, suddenly none of you can stay seated? What is it—do you think Sadie’s an easy target? Or are some of you itching to slide into the…”
Chairperson’s chair yourselves? Have you all forgotten who spent the last three years keeping this company from collapsing, pulling it back from the edge and giving it solid ground to stand on?”noveldrama
.
.
.
###Chapter 1162:
His tone wasn’t raised, but each word struck like a pin to the skin, sharp enough to drain the color from the attendees’ faces, then send the flush right back in.
“In those three years, Ms. Hudson gave everything she had to this company. Are your eyes so clouded you can’t even see that? The Castro family stands firmly behind her. Whatever she chooses, we’ll back it without question. As for the chairperson title, that’s something for her and Mr. Wall to decide—not you. The role might look prestigious, but maybe you should take a hard look at yourselves first. Out of everyone in this room, who is truly qualified to shoulder that responsibility?”
And with that, Blaine walked straight over to the head seat without breaking stride.
That polished mahogany chair—symbolic of Wall Group’s highest power—sat empty and waiting.
With a swift motion, he brought his palm down on the chair’s back, the echo filling the silent room.
No one dared break the hush that followed.
The elders, who’d once used their years as a shield, now sat frozen, as if their voices had been cut off at the source.
Blaine, seeing their stunned silence, felt a spark of satisfaction.
These old bastards had made a sport out of bullying the vulnerable. If he didn’t put them in their place, they’d soon forget who was really in charge.
“If any of you are so convinced you’re gifted and brilliant enough to take on the chairperson role, that’s perfectly fine. Just leave me out of it—and stop dragging Sadie into your schemes. Go straight to my grandfather instead. Lay out your grand ambitions in front of him and find out for yourselves if he’s on board with them.”
Hearing those words sent an even deeper wave of fear across the room, leaving every face looking more shaken than before.
No one was foolish enough to seek out Ralph.
Trying to confront him would be the same as inviting disaster.
Even in retirement, Ralph’s reputation as a business titan lingered, his authority undiminished.
Everyone in the room knew that the bond between him and Sadie’s grandfather ran deep, and he had always treated Sadie as if she were his own flesh and blood.
Speaking against Sadie or making a grab for the chairperson’s seat would only earn Ralph’s wrath—and he wouldn’t hesitate to toss anyone out on the spot. Watching the senior executives wilt under the pressure, Blaine felt a cold satisfaction twist inside him.
He didn’t spare another glance at the nervous shareholders as he strode from the room.
Samuel was quick to trail after him, his footsteps light, shooting Blaine a silent thumbs-up in admiration.
Though Blaine could be lighthearted most days, when it counted, his sharp tongue and cool authority turned the tide.
None of the shareholders could match his presence or command.
Yet, a flicker of unease still tugged at Samuel’s mind.
Could those people, burned by Blaine’s words, really try their luck by complaining to Ralph?
.

###Chapter 1163:
Sadie would surely have Ralph’s loyalty, but if the truth got twisted, even he might become agitated—and that would spell trouble for everyone.
Blaine, picking up on Samuel’s silent worry, slowed as they approached the door. He stopped abruptly, then turned with a sly grin.
“Samuel, you’re still too young to grasp the layers underneath all this. You give them too much credit.” He let out a scoff, his voice dripping with contempt. “None of them would ever have the guts to complain in front of my grandfather. And if they’re foolish enough to try, they’d better be prepared to get smacked down with that cane he’s so fond of swinging!”
Samuel nodded, the realization settling in. Indeed, Ralph wasn’t someone to cross.
Blaine caught the change in his eyes and lifted a brow, clearly pleased. Then he paused, as if something important had just come to mind. “Any updates on Hailey?” he asked.
Samuel’s face shifted, the ease draining from his features. “I’ve already looped in the police,” he said. “We pulled surveillance from the roads around the urban village. The cars that took Hailey were all black. They drove straight out toward the outskirts, but just before hitting the city limits… they disappeared from every camera.”
Blaine’s head snapped up. “Disappeared?” he echoed. “That many cars, in broad daylight, and not a single camera caught where they went? How could that be? Unbelievable!”
He didn’t buy it. Someone had tampered with the footage. Whoever was behind this wasn’t just some reckless gang.
Blaine’s gaze sharpened.
“Not our priority right now,” he said. His eyes flickered slightly. “I’ve got leads of my own. Please try to fix Jack’s phone and see what’s in there. Keep tabs on the company. If anything shifts, I want to hear it from you first.”
Samuel gave a firm nod. “Understood, Mr. Castro. I’ll stay on it.”
Blaine didn’t respond. He turned and left without another word.
g?lnσνs?c?m, your destination for tales
His thoughts weren’t on Jack’s phone or the company anymore. They circled back to Sadie.
By the time he reached the hospital, thirty minutes had passed.
As he stepped into the lobby, he slowed, something pulling at the corner of his vision.
There. Just ahead. A familiar face.
Alex?
What was he doing here?
He narrowed his eyes, not trusting the glimpse. But after a moment, there was no mistaking it.
His lips curled into a knowing smile as he made his way over, every sense on edge.
“Mr. Howe,” he greeted coolly. “What a coincidence. Didn’t you have a car accident recently? You’re up and about already?”
Alex turned at the voice, wearing the same unbothered smile he always did. “Mr. Castro. Just came to have my bandages changed. Since I’m already here… I figured I’d pay a visit to Sadie.”noveldrama

###Chapter 1164:
His tone sounded casual—no cracks, no slips.
Blaine nodded slowly, giving him a brief once-over. “Mr. Howe, your assistant… Stan. I haven’t seen him for a while. How is he?”
Alex’s smile faltered for half a second before shifting into mild confusion. “Ah, right. I haven’t seen him in a while, either. He hasn’t been answering my calls. Figured he was just being lazy again—probably took a leave without telling me. You know, guys getting more and more careless.” He shook his head, then smoothly shifted topics. “How’s Sadie? Has she woken up yet?”
Blaine didn’t respond right away. He just kept staring.
Alex stood there, all calm smiles and casual concern. Nothing in his expression raised alarms.
But Blaine couldn’t shake the feeling that something didn’t sit right.
That easy smile. Those open, steady eyes. There was something wrong.
Alex noticed the lingering look and raised his brows, almost playfully. “Mr. Castro, you’re staring. Is there something on my face?”
Blaine let out a short laugh, more awkward than amused. He was about to speak when a bodyguard burst in from outside, breathless and wide-eyed. “Mr. Castro, I have bad news!” He ran over, barely able to get the words out. “We just got word—Stan’s been found. He’s badly hurt. Can’t talk. Can’t move. They left him near the edge of the urban village.”
The words slammed into Blaine like a blow to the chest. He stood there, stunned.
What the hell was going on?
How could this happen?
Who would do something like this? Who could be so ruthless?
Blaine instinctively turned to Alex.
He looked just as stunned—his worry and urgency seemed real.
“What?” Alex grabbed the bodyguard’s arm, his voice unsteady. “Where is he now?”
New chapters now on .c?m
The guard, thrown off by the reaction, pointed toward the corridor with a shaky hand. “He’s in surgery.”
Alex’s face drained of color. Without saying another word, he bolted down the hall.
Blaine snapped out of his daze and followed.noveldrama
Outside the operating room, the red “In Surgery” sign glowed faintly, casting an eerie hue across the hallway.
The air felt thick. Still.
Alex stood there, fists clenched, chest rising and falling with shallow breaths. Then he turned suddenly.
“Mr. Castro… did you know Stan was missing this whole time?”
The look on his face—raw anguish, disbelief—made something in Blaine’s gut twist. But it didn’t shake the feeling that had been gnawing at him.
“Mr. Howe, calm down. Let me explain,” Blaine said. “Here’s what we know. A few days ago, when Hailey was taken, those thugs took Stan, too. Jack—our man—was also hurt by them. He’s still in the ICU. I’ve had people searching for Stan, but I didn’t expect this.” He stopped, the weight of it all pressing down.

###Chapter 1165:
He had assumed Alex would’ve known something. Anything.
But when Alex finished listening, his body started to sway. His face had gone pale.
He shook his head slowly, eyes glazed. “How could this happen?”
Unease crept through Blaine’s chest, making his shoulders tense.
“Mr. Howe, please, try not to torment yourself with worry. Stan, he… he’s going to pull through this.”
Alex’s knuckles whitened as his fists trembled. “Who could have attacked Stan so viciously? He’s always stood by my side, so someone must be targeting me deliberately.”
Alex’s anguish appeared genuine, his pain etched deep in every line of his face.
The knot of suspicion in Blaine’s chest loosened a bit.
The operating room doors burst open with a metallic whoosh.
Alex lunged forward, his hands seizing the doctor’s shoulders before the man could take another step. “How is Stan?”
The doctor pulled off his surgical mask with exhausted fingers, releasing one heavy sigh after another.
“He suffered severe trauma with massive internal bleeding. We’ve managed to stop the hemorrhaging for now, but his chances of waking up remain slim. He’s been moved to intensive care.”
The words hit Alex like a physical blow, sending him stumbling backward as the color drained from his face.
Blaine surged forward, catching Alex’s arm before he could collapse.
Words of comfort died on Blaine’s tongue, leaving him powerless in the face of such devastation.
Stan’s brutal ordeal would shake anyone to their core.
Alex fought to steady himself, drawing ragged breaths until his composure returned.
Determination blazed in his eyes as he vowed to uncover the truth and deliver the justice Stan deserved.

“Mr. Castro, I must excuse myself. I need to return immediately to gather my team and investigate this matter thoroughly. Also, I need to conduct a thorough check within the company.”
Blaine nodded in understanding, his expression grave.
He watched Alex’s unsteady retreat, his mind churning with conflicted thoughts. Alex’s raw grief had felt authentic, carved deep into every gesture. Perhaps his suspicious nature was betraying him, creating shadows where none existed.
Maybe Stan’s nightmare had nothing to do with Alex after all.
Outside the hospital, Alex strode toward a sleek black Bentley waiting at the curb.
The moment the car door clicked shut, every trace of grief melted from his features like snow in sunlight.
Alex’s thoughts turned cold and calculating. Stan, that pathetic fool, had been nothing but a liability.

###Chapter 1166:
At least now, he could be useful for once.
The driver’s voice carried careful hesitation. “Mr. Howe, Ms. Burgess survived.” A cold sneer twisted Alex’s lips at the news.
The woman possessed an irritating resilience that defied expectations.
But it didn’t concern him now.
With the baby secured in his possession, Hailey’s fate had become irrelevant to Alex’s plans.
“Did you make contact with the individual I specified earlier?”
The driver’s response came without hesitation. “Yes, sir. He’s already at Nirvana, awaiting your arrival. We can proceed there directly.”
“Excellent.” Alex’s voice carried cold satisfaction.
The driver fell silent and turned the ignition, the engine purring to life. Thirty minutes later, the Bentley glided to a halt before Nirvana’s imposing entrance.
Nirvana stood as one of Jazmah’s most exclusive dining spots, famous for its impenetrable security and absolute discretion, drawing the city’s elite for their most sensitive negotiations.
Alex smoothed his jacket and emerged from the vehicle, striding purposefully through Nirvana’s entrance.
He made his way to a room on the third floor with familiar ease.
He pushed the door open to reveal a lavish room where an older man with sparse hair and a bloated frame lounged between two stunning young women, his expression oozing with lecherous satisfaction.
This was Malcolm Pierce, a Wall Group shareholder, whose greed and lust were matched only by his calculating cunning.
Alex crossed the threshold with confident strides. “Mr. Pierce, it’s been far too long since our last encounter.”
Malcolm’s gaze drifted lazily toward the doorway, and he pressed lingering kisses to each woman’s cheek.
Both women read the signal perfectly, rising with fluid grace and gliding from the room with deliberate sways of their hips, the door clicking shut behind them.noveldrama
Your adventure awaits at gα?ησν?s?c〇m
Malcolm turned his attention fully to Alex, his beady eyes glittering with sharp intelligence. “Mr. Howe, what exactly do you want to talk to me about?”
Alex lifted his hand in a deliberate signal, his fingers cutting through the air with practiced authority.
Within moments, several massive bodyguards filed through the door, each carrying a weighty black briefcase.
The cases snapped open with sharp clicks, exposing towers of cash that gleamed under the room’s ambient lighting.
A spark of keen interest flashed through Malcolm’s narrow eyes.
He preserved his mask of calculating indifference, though his grip on his cup tightened imperceptibly.
Such extravagant generosity from Alex hinted at dangerously ambitious plans. Malcolm understood he must navigate these treacherous waters carefully, lest he become Alex’s expendable tool.

###Chapter 1167:
“Mr. Howe, what’s the meaning of this display?”
Alex settled onto the plush sofa facing Malcolm, a subtle smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Let’s cut through the pleasantries and get straight to business.”
“Mr. Pierce, as one of Wall Group’s major shareholders, you’ve had your fair share of shadow plays over the years—particularly when it comes to quietly backing Coyle and Sutton. So tell me, is it time for you to hang up your gloves and finally enjoy retirement?” Alex asked, his voice casual but razor-sharp.
Malcolm’s hand jerked, and the coffee in his cup sloshed dangerously close to the brim. His once-easy smile faltered mid-curve, replaced by a flicker of something raw—fear.
How the hell did Alex know that?
Back then, the alliance with Coyle and Sutton had been buried under layers of secrecy. Only a trusted few had known the truth, and they’d all sworn silence—or disappeared. Coyle’s family was all but gone now. No loose ends.
So how did Alex dig this up? Did they miss something? Or had Alex been quietly peeling back layers, tracking him all this time?
Malcolm forced out a laugh—two short, brittle chuckles that echoed awkwardly in the silence. Outside, he looked composed. Inside, he was unraveling.
“Mr. Howe, what are you implying?” Malcolm asked with a tight smile, his voice smooth as polished glass. “The past is hardly worth dredging up. These days, Ms. Hudson leads Wall Group with unquestioned authority, and her brilliance is acknowledged by all. As for me—I’m far too old to challenge someone of her caliber.”
Every word was carefully measured, crafted to distance himself from any suspicion.
“And more importantly…” His tone dipped, edged now with wariness and something bordering on fear. “Noah—Mr. Wall—has returned. Noah and Sadie, united and shielded by the Castro family? That’s a force no sane man would cross. Not even me.”
That part, at least, rang with absolute truth.
Noah and Sadie weren’t just powerful; together, they were untouchable—bolstered by the formidable Castro family, they were a storm few in Jazmah dared to face head-on.
g ? lnσ ν ?s?com, your storytelling home
Malcolm might have been ambitious, even reckless at times, but he wasn’t suicidal.
Alex, however, responded with nothing more than a mild, unreadable smile.
With a casual flick of his hand, he gave a silent command. One of the nearby bodyguards immediately responded, retrieving a folder from his briefcase and presenting it to Malcolm with deference. Malcolm’s brows furrowed as suspicion crept in.
What was this?
He slowly unfolded the document—a hospital diagnosis report.
The moment his eyes landed on the familiar name and the results within, his entire body stiffened.
.
.noveldrama

###Chapter 1168:
It was as if the ground had dropped out beneath him. His voice cracked as he spoke, barely more than a whisper. “Noah… Noah has lost his memory?” It didn’t make sense.
How could someone like Noah—powerful, sharp, untouchable—suffer something so devastating?
If this truth ever saw the light of day, the entire business world of Jazmah would explode.
Alex watched the shock ripple across Malcolm’s face, and a quiet, satisfied smile played on his lips. “Yes,” he said smoothly. “Noah’s mind is a blank slate. And Ms. Hudson? Her health is failing. Right now, it’s that greenhorn Blaine managing most of Wall Group’s operations.”
Malcolm swiftly folded the report and tucked it away like a dangerous secret.
His eyes, once clouded with confusion, now gleamed with something sharper. With Noah lost in the haze of amnesia and Sadie battling fragile health, control of Wall Group had quietly fallen into the hands of Blaine—an outsider. On the surface, the company appeared stable. But beneath that polished exterior, turbulence brewed.
For Malcolm, this could be the moment he’d been waiting for.
Still, he wore the mask of concern, brow furrowed, voice hesitant. “But… that still won’t do,” he said, feigning reluctance. “Wall Group has Averi—the rightful heir. That boy carries the Wall bloodline. As long as he’s around, no one else holds the rightful claim to power.”
Averi might have been young, but rumors swirled about his sharp mind, his inherited brilliance—a spark of Noah’s cunning already igniting within him.
And he wasn’t just any child—he was Sadie’s son.
As long as she drew breath, Sadie would guard him like a lioness guarding her cub.
Alex’s smile deepened, curling with intrigue and something unspoken. “Mr. Pierce, you’re mistaken. Averi is not the only heir to the Wall legacy.”
The moment he heard those words, Malcolm shot up from his seat, no longer able to stay calm. “Mr. Howe, what exactly are you trying to imply?” Was it possible Noah had secretly fathered another child somewhere else? Such a revelation was even more shocking than Noah losing his memory!noveldrama
g?lnσνs?c?m brings endless adventures
Calmly, Alex reached forward and took a leisurely sip of his drink, maintaining an air of indifferent elegance. “Noah has been living under the identity of Patrick from Burgess Group for a long while. Surely you’ve heard that Patrick’s wife, Hailey Burgess, had become pregnant, haven’t you, Mr. Pierce?”
Malcolm’s eyes widened in sudden shock.
Hailey!
Of course, he recognized that name immediately. Ever since Patrick appeared seemingly from nowhere, Hailey had remained consistently by his side.
A daring thought swiftly occurred to Malcolm.
“Just yesterday,” Alex continued casually, setting down his glass, yet his tone held the devastating impact of a grenade. “Ms. Burgess safely delivered a healthy son.”
A surge of excitement rushed through Malcolm, making his vision briefly brighten in pure delight.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1169:
A son!
Noah’s son!
Another rightful heir to Wall Group!
Until now, Malcolm and his allies had always lacked the leverage and legitimacy needed to cause real trouble within Wall Group. Averi’s position was ironclad—Noah and Sadie’s only biological son, the publicly recognized heir, his status unshakable.
Everything changed, however, with the prospect of them holding another Wall Group heir—Noah’s other son. That would tip the scales entirely.
A turn of fortune like this was almost too perfect.
Still, Malcolm’s reputation for cunning held true. Calculations flickered behind his eyes, caution never fully abandoned.
A sly squint narrowed his gaze. “Mr. Howe, if memory serves, you once had a soft spot for Sadie?”
There was no mistaking the meaning behind his question. Hadn’t Alex shown an interest in Sadie before? What game was he playing now, plotting against her?
Hearing Malcolm’s words, Alex gripped his glass a little tighter. Obsession glimmered, sharp and unmistakable, in his stare.
Only in the ruins of her world—when Sadie had lost Wall Group and been deserted by everyone—would Alex seize his chance.
He yearned for the day she realized he was the only one left to lean on.
Every flicker of emotion crossed Alex’s face in a heartbeat, but Malcolm saw it—unreturned love, warped into something darker—resentment, maybe even revenge.
For a woman like Sadie, that was almost inevitable. What man wouldn’t want her?
Any lingering doubts in Malcolm vanished in an instant.
Lifting his wineglass, he let a smile spread over his features. “Then here’s to a successful partnership, Mr. Howe!”
Alex also slowly raised his glass, clinking it lightly with Malcolm’s. “To our partnership.”
They wrapped up their phony courtesies quickly, parting ways without further delay.
Malcolm was the first to exit the private room, a sense of quiet satisfaction on his face. A cheerful tune slipped from his lips as he walked, and just as he rounded the corner—”Ouch!”
The collision stopped him in his tracks.
Automatically, Malcolm stepped back and glanced upward, mild surprise flickering across his features.
Of all people, it was Sadie’s assistant, Tina, standing before him.
A flash of discomfort passed over his expression. “Ms. Delgado, what brings you here?”
It was a question Tina could have easily thrown back at him.
One hand reached for her aching shoulder, and Tina’s brow furrowed as she shot Malcolm a wary look from head to toe.

###Chapter 1170:
Warnings from Sadie rang in her mind. Malcolm was a sly old fox—wasn’t he supposed to be recovering in a villa on the city’s edge? What was he doing here now?
“Mr. Pierce, I’m just delivering lunch to Ms. Hudson,” Tina replied, lifting the packed meal for emphasis.
Malcolm managed a strained laugh.
“Ah, I see, I see. I’ll get out of your way, Ms. Delgado. Plenty on my own plate to handle.” With a quick nod, he turned and made a beeline for the elevator, keen to avoid any further questioning.noveldrama
Right on cue, the elevator chimed open, and Malcolm darted inside, his hurried departure speaking volumes. The elevator doors slowly closed.
Tina was left standing in the hallway, her frown deepening.
Something about Malcolm’s behavior felt off, a knot of suspicion settling in her chest.
Balancing the lunchbox in her arms, she made her way back to the hospital, her mind tangled with unease.
Inside the patient room, Sadie sat propped against the pillows, papers spread across her lap. The moment the door clicked open, she glanced up, immediately catching the tension in Tina’s expression.
“What’s the matter? Did something happen?”
Pulled from her thoughts, Tina set the lunch on the bedside table.
Every detail of her run-in with Malcolm at Nirvana spilled out in her recounting. Sadie’s hand, still holding a pen, paused mid-note, her eyes narrowing with cold alertness.
She had expected the company’s restless shareholders to stir the pot once they knew that Noah was alive.
Yet Malcolm showing up at Nirvana might not mean much—at least, not yet.
“Keep an eye on the shareholders—Malcolm in particular. Let me know about any suspicious moves immediately,” Sadie instructed.
Without missing a beat, Tina agreed. “Will do, Sadie.”

Documents were pushed aside as Sadie turned to other matters, asking, “Were you able to lock down a meeting with the owner of the Faron Retreat property?”
Tina quickly replied, “Yes.”
Approval flickered in Sadie’s eyes. “Perfect.”
She reached for the utensils Tina offered, her tone composed. “Let’s eat first, then head to see Noah together.”
Thirty minutes passed. Sadie now occupied a wheelchair, with Tina steering her through the corridor toward the adjacent ward.
Inside, a physician hovered near Noah, who lay unmoving on the bed, his skin colorless, his eyes shut—lifeless in appearance.
Sadie’s chest tightened. “Why hasn’t he woken up? Is there any change?”
The doctor removed his stethoscope slowly, his expression weighed down by gravity. A muted exhale left his lips.

###Chapter 1171:
“Ms. Hudson, we’ve exhausted our options. The most recent scans indicate the cerebral obstruction is progressing. It’s critical. Without swift action, I’m afraid…”
He trailed off. The implication was clear.
If the blockage kept advancing, the result would be catastrophic.
Sadie clenched her fingers in her lap. Alarm shimmered in her gaze.
She couldn’t let anything happen to him. She wouldn’t.
“I’ve already dispatched someone to contact the finest specialists at Rosewood Hospital. Whatever’s required, we’ll fight this.”
The doctor gave a brief nod and stepped out.
A stillness settled in—broken only by machines murmuring and soft breathing.
Tina brought Sadie closer to the bedside.
Sadie extended a hand and brushed her fingers over Noah’s.
They were cool to the touch. The same hand that once offered comfort now felt foreign.
“Noah… you’ve got to pull through,” she murmured, her voice uneven. “Can you hear me? Please.”
She glanced toward Tina. “Any updates from Dr. Gill?”
Tina hesitated before shaking her head faintly.
She had done everything possible to find Evan—a renowned neurologist—but he’d disappeared, unreachable by all known means.
Sadie’s spirits dropped.
If they couldn’t find Evan, then what alternatives remained?
She couldn’t simply sit and witness Noah slipping further away.
Waiting wasn’t an option. Time was running out. She needed another way. Suddenly, Sadie’s chin snapped up, resolve igniting in her gaze. A sudden thought struck her like lightning.
“Stuart!” she blurted before hesitation could catch up.
Your next story starts here: g?lnσνs?com
Tina stopped mid-motion, her features shifting—realization dawning fast.
She could already guess Sadie’s plan. She intended to contact him.
But Stuart… Getting involved with him was like walking blindfolded through a minefield.
“Sadie, think,” Tina said, her voice laced with worry. “What he’s done—those neural chip trials, the ones that rewrite or wipe memory entirely—they might clear the blockage, yeah. But they’re unstable. Experimental. It could permanently obliterate everything Mr. Wall remembers!”
Everything. His childhood. His story. His connection to Sadie. Gone.
Sadie’s hands quivered. Of course, she knew the risks. Of course, she understood what it could cost.
But Evan was unreachable. And Noah hadn’t opened his eyes in days. Time was slipping.noveldrama
Stuart’s inventions were a gamble—like swallowing fire to chase warmth—but possibly their final hope.

###Chapter 1172:
A reckless choice. Maybe the only one they had left.
She steadied herself, her voice low but clear. “Where can I find Stuart now?”
Sixty minutes later, the living area in Sadie’s private ward was thick with tension.
Tina returned, flanked by grim-faced bodyguards. Among them walked a man, a hood covering his features.
He moved like a tightly coiled wire.
“Sadie,” Tina murmured, stepping toward the window where Sadie stood watching the horizon. “He’s arrived.”
Sadie pivoted slowly. Her stare locked on the veiled figure. Her brow furrowed ever so slightly.
She approached and gave a discreet nod.
The guards released the man’s arms and pulled away the hood.
The man in front of her matched the photos in the documents she had pored over.
This was Stuart. But in person, he felt heavier—his stare burdened, his posture taut with suspicion.
Being dragged in like a prisoner had clearly set him on edge.
He massaged his wrists, glancing around before fixing his gaze on her.
“Ms. Hudson,” he croaked, guarded. “Want to explain what the hell I’m doing here?”
Sadie didn’t flinch.
She examined him closely. This was the infamous brain-hacker—the evil genius who rewired minds like computer boards.
And for Noah’s sake, she had no option but to take that plunge.
Her spine straightened. Her voice carried authority. “Dr. Lawson, considering your collaboration with the Burgess Group, I think you could understand me.”
Then she ordered, “Come in!”
Sadie’s voice sliced through the silence, crisp and commanding. The two bodyguards stationed by the door responded instantly, stepping forward with two heavy black suitcases gripped in their hands.

Metal clasps clicked open one after another, revealing thick stacks of bundled cash arranged in perfect rows. The sight seized Stuart’s attention immediately.noveldrama
Stuart’s eyebrows furrowed, forming a subtle crease across his forehead. The audacity struck him like a slap. Did this woman honestly believe she could purchase his cooperation? What kind of man did she imagine him to be? Perhaps she had mistaken him for someone like his brother—the type who would sacrifice anything and anyone for the right sum of money.
Ice-cold disdain surged through his chest, yet his expression remained perfectly composed, revealing nothing of the contempt brewing beneath the surface.
He moved across the living area with unhurried steps, settling onto the plush sofa with practiced ease. His posture appeared relaxed, though every movement carried calculated purpose.
“Ms. Hudson, if you have something to discuss, then speak plainly.” His voice emerged cool and measured.
.

.
###Chapter 1173:noveldrama
Sadie observed his unshakeable composure, her estimation of the man rising with each passing second.
Maintaining such control in the presence of overwhelming wealth suggested two possibilities: either he had witnessed every temptation the world could offer, or his desires transcended mere financial gain.
She decided not to beat around the bush.
“I’ll speak directly. Dr. Lawson, regarding the technology you created—the brain chip implantation that can modify or completely wipe memories—what’s the success rate?”
Stuart’s eyes narrowed, disbelief flickering across his features like lightning in a storm.
Questions hammered through his mind relentlessly. How had she discovered such classified information? How did she understand even the technical foundation of his work? And what desperation drove her to mention it now?
The only explanation that made sense was Noah’s deteriorating condition—a decline so severe that she found herself grasping for solutions the world still condemned as dangerous and unethical.
His thoughts raced into overdrive, analyzing every possible angle and implication.
Following a brief silence, his gaze swept the room with deliberate precision, cataloging each person present and assessing their potential threat level.
Sadie caught the telltale pause, recognizing his sudden wariness.
“Everyone here has earned my complete trust. Dr. Lawson, you may speak without reservation.”
Her declaration triggered something cold within Stuart, and the corners of his mouth curved upward in a smile that held no warmth—only bitter amusement. The concept struck him as laughably naive. Trust—genuine, unwavering loyalty—did such a thing truly exist in this ruthless world?
A laugh escaped him, quiet and brittle as autumn leaves, carrying within it years of accumulated cynicism and barely restrained contempt.
Silence stretched between them before he moved with deliberate calm, reaching forward to snap shut both open suitcases with decisive clicks.
Every gesture flowed with unhurried precision, as if he were handling something distasteful. His rejection resonated through the room with unmistakable clarity.

The action hit Sadie like a physical blow, freezing her in place.
He was refusing the money? Of all the scenarios she had prepared for, outright rejection of payment had never crossed her mind.
She had braced herself for astronomical figures—but complete dismissal of financial incentive? A question burned through her thoughts: what could possibly motivate a man who spurned such wealth?
Stuart’s attention returned to her, his eyes holding secrets she couldn’t yet decipher.
“Collaboration is possible.” His voice flowed like silk over steel. “However, this”—his knuckles rapped against one of the closed suitcases with hollow finality—”represents nothing I desire.”

###Chapter 1174:
Relief and confusion warred within Sadie as she drew a steadying breath, forcing her racing pulse to slow.
As long as he was willing to help Noah, everything else could be negotiated, adjusted, or overcome.
She gave a casual shrug, though her voice required conscious effort to maintain its relaxed tone.
“That’s fine. If you can save Noah, we can discuss compensation—provided your demands remain within the realm of possibility.” Her gaze locked onto his, searching for any hint of his true intentions.
Her words seemed to trigger something deeper within him, and he turned toward the expansive window, his attention drawn to something beyond the glass.
His profile revealed the tension he’d been concealing—jaw muscles tight, eyes reflecting emotions too complex for Sadie to interpret with certainty. The silence stretched between them before he faced her again, wearing a smile that concealed more than it revealed.
“We have an agreement.”
Wave after wave of relief crashed through Sadie’s chest, though she fought to keep the emotion from showing on her face.
Stuart hesitated, weighing each word before they left his lips.
“Ms. Hudson, I’m curious about the depth of your knowledge regarding my background.”
Confusion creased Sadie’s forehead as she tried to decode the underlying meaning of his question.
The comprehensive investigation she had commissioned on Stuart had yielded frustratingly little information, as if someone had systematically erased most traces of his existence.
The few facts she had managed to gather painted a picture of exceptional brilliance in neuroscience, combined with an almost hermit-like existence that made him nearly impossible to track or predict.
References to family appeared only once in all her research—a twin brother whose existence seemed almost mythical.
Every trace of this brother had vanished so completely that it suggested deliberate erasure, as if someone with considerable resources had methodically eliminated his digital footprint from existence.noveldrama
gα?ησν?sоm, where stories thrive
“Dr. Lawson, I need you to clarify your meaning.”
The man raised his head slowly, and Sadie found herself staring into eyes that gleamed like polished metal—hard, cold, and utterly unforgiving.
“The man you believe you’re addressing doesn’t exist in this room. I am his brother—Hurst Lawson.”
Shock drained all color from Sadie’s face, leaving her expression completely vacant.
Her head snapped toward Tina, only to find her assistant’s face mirroring the same devastating realization.
The individual who had presented himself as Stuart Lawson throughout their entire interaction was now declaring himself to be someone else entirely—Hurst?

###Chapter 1175:
The truth slammed into Sadie with the force of a freight train, leaving her reeling.
Memory catapulted her back to the day in the urban village, when Hailey’s plan had nearly claimed Noah’s life.
During those chaotic moments, when gunfire and screaming had filled the air, someone had vanished without a trace.
The question crystallized with terrifying clarity—had the genuine Stuart escaped during that time?
So, the person seated across from her at this very moment had been orchestrating an elaborate masquerade since their first encounter.
Panic clawed at Sadie’s chest, constricting her breathing, yet she summoned every ounce of self-control to maintain her focus. Her gaze locked onto Hurst with laser intensity.
“Your timing in revealing this information cannot be accidental. What message are you attempting to convey?”
A man capable of such elaborate deception wouldn’t expose himself without calculating every possible advantage the revelation might provide.
Hurst maintained unwavering eye contact, his expression still touched by that infuriating smile that suggested he found Sadie’s confusion deeply amusing.
“Allow me to eliminate any confusion, Ms. Hudson. The neural chip implantation technology you seek? Not only can I perform these procedures, but my skills have surpassed anything my brother ever achieved.”
Venom dripped from every word, years of accumulated resentment poisoning his voice.
“Decades of my existence have been sacrificed to his ambitions—serving as his replacement, absorbing consequences meant for him, sanitizing disasters he created and abandoned.”
“This feeling—it’s like being trapped underwater, choking on everything I can’t say.”
Years of buried bitterness flickered in Hurst’s eyes, too raw to be forgotten.
Sadie stayed silent, absorbing it all.
?σ? υ ι .
So there was a deeper thread, tightly wound and hidden in the dark.noveldrama
Hurst noticed her stillness but pressed on. “My goal is clear,” he said steadily. “I’ll help you save Mr. Wall. But once that’s done, Ms. Hudson, I need something in return.”
He paused, his expression hardening, eyes now sharp enough to cut. “Help me kill Stuart. Then make sure I get back to Zupren alive.”
Sadie blinked, the weight of his words crashing over her.
This wasn’t what she’d expected—not even close.
“You’re planning to take Stuart’s place… completely?”
Hurst let out an unrestrained chuckle, his smile touched with the ease of someone finally unburdened. For once, he didn’t bother to veil his true intentions.
“Yes,” he said smoothly. “I have my own ambitions, my own ends to chase. But tell me—does that interfere with your goal of saving Mr. Wall?” He leaned in, just enough to press his point, his voice taking on a velvety edge of persuasion.

###Chapter 1176:
“Ms. Hudson, take your time if you must. But how long do you think Mr. Wall has left?”
The words struck like a blade, carving into the softest part of Sadie’s resolve. Given Noah’s fragile condition, there was no time to waste—his treatment couldn’t wait another day.
Sadie inhaled deeply, willing herself to steady the storm surging in her chest. She knew exactly what Hurst was doing—dangling Noah’s life like bait on a hook.
“I need time to think,” she said, her voice low and strained. “You may go now.”noveldrama
At her signal, the bodyguards stepped forward wordlessly, seizing Hurst and binding his wrists behind him once more.
As he was being led away, Hurst slowed beside her, just long enough to deliver a parting shot—a small, knowing smile that hinted at victory.
He didn’t need to rush.
Time was on his side, but the same could not be said for Noah.
The door clicked shut behind him, and the room was swallowed by silence. Tina rushed to Sadie’s side, her eyes wide with anxiety. “Sadie, what… what are we supposed to do now? Hurst—his demand is just too…” The words trailed off, lost somewhere between disbelief and fear.
Sadie let out a tired breath, her fingers pressing against her temples.
This wasn’t how she thought things would unfold.
First Stuart, now Hurst—two brothers, each a storm in their own right.
Neither of them was predictable. Neither of them, controllable.
And the real Stuart? Gone. Vanished the day he escaped that urban village, leaving behind only silence and shadows.
That disappearance had thrown everything into chaos. Sadie bit down on her lip, hard enough to focus.
She couldn’t afford to falter now.
One way or another, she had to push forward. Whether it meant accepting Hurst’s terms—or finding a path neither of them saw coming—she needed to be ready.
LΑττ chαρτ?rs ιn glov?l.
“Tina.”
“Deploy more people—now. We need to find Stuart. Dead or alive, bring him in.” If Hurst’s claims about his superior skill were true, then the real Stuart might have already outlived his usefulness.
Sadie wasn’t ready to take Hurst at his word—not entirely. “And keep trying to reach Evan,” she added.
After all, each new attempt was another heartbeat of possibility.
Tina nodded, her expression steely with understanding. “Understood.” She didn’t waste a second—turning briskly on her heel and disappearing down the hall, urgency crackling in her every step.
Sadie drifted toward the window, her arms folding as she stared at the leaden sky.
It pressed down on the world like a weight—just as her thoughts did on her chest.
If saving Noah meant shaking hands with the devil, then so be it. She would risk it all, no matter the cost.

###Chapter 1177:
A soft knock broke the silence. Sadie blinked, pulled abruptly from her thoughts, her heart already bracing for what—or who—waited on the other side of the door.
“Come in.”
The door creaked open, revealing a familiar silhouette.
It was Alex.
He stepped inside, carrying a lunchbox in one hand, his face lit with the usual calm, reassuring smile.
But the moment he saw Sadie standing alone, her expression clouded and distant, his smile faltered—just slightly.
A flicker of unease passed through his eyes. He hadn’t expected her to be awake.
“Sadie,” he said softly, his voice tinged with quiet regret. “Sorry… I thought you might be resting. I just wanted to check on you—to see if you’re feeling any better.”
Sadie looked at him, something unspoken stirring in her chest.
There was always a faint dissonance in Alex’s presence—something she couldn’t quite name but couldn’t ignore either.
She offered him a small, practiced smile. “I’m okay, Alex. Really, I’m feeling a lot better. Thank you for coming by.”
Alex placed the insulated food container on the nearby table with deliberate care. His gaze lingered on Sadie’s pale face, where worry cast deep shadows beneath her eyes.
He hesitated, as if a troubling thought had suddenly surfaced, then spoke with careful, measured words that probed for answers.
“Sadie, I heard things have been rather chaotic at Wall Group lately. If you’re willing to discuss it…”
His words trailed into silence, leaving the unfinished sentence suspended between them like a question mark.
Sadie froze, shock rippling through her body.
What was he talking about? Her mind raced with possibilities—what could have happened to Wall Group?
Recently, every ounce of her energy had poured into Noah’s care. She admitted to herself that the company had slipped from her watchful attention.
For Alex to mention it now—there had to be a compelling reason.noveldrama
When he noticed the tension building in her features, Alex moved closer with quick, cautious steps, softening his voice to a gentler tone.
“Sadie, don’t worry. I heard Blaine’s managing the situation. Howe Group will always stand with Wall Group—not for financial gain, but because of you.”
Sadie’s chest tightened under the heavy weight of his affection, the intensity of it pressing down on her like a suffocating blanket.
She had always understood the depth of his feelings for her, yet she found herself unable to return even a fraction of that emotion.
His support felt less like genuine assistance and more like an intricate net that trapped her with invisible threads. The sensation made her desperate to escape.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1178:
Sadie’s expression tightened with strain. She deliberately avoided meeting Alex’s eyes and turned her back to him with purposeful finality.
“Alex, thank you for everything, but there’s no romantic future for us. I want to be your friend—nothing more than a friend. Can you accept that truth?”
Her words carried the weight of finality, leaving absolutely no space for misinterpretation or false hope.
The message was crystal clear—if Alex crossed that boundary again, even their friendship might crumble into nothing.
She needed to establish this boundary with absolute certainty, ensuring no corner remained where misplaced hope could take root and flourish.
Alex’s hands slowly curled into tight fists at his sides, knuckles whitening with suppressed emotion.
Rejection struck him again—this time swift and decisive, without hesitation or the slightest opening for negotiation.
Something twisted viciously in his chest, a deep and relentless ache that refused to release its grip on his heart.
Acceptance felt impossible. His mind simply refused to process this final, crushing blow.
He lowered his gaze, attempting to conceal the tempest raging behind his eyes, and forced his lips into what he hoped resembled a smile.
“Sadie, with Noah lying unconscious and his fate hanging in the balance… you don’t have to shoulder this burden alone.”
He desperately wanted her to understand that she didn’t need to sacrifice her entire life for Noah’s uncertain future.
The possibility of a different choice existed—she could choose him instead. But to Sadie, his words transformed into a sharp blade that sliced directly through her heart, leaving her bleeding with fresh pain.
“Enough!” she snapped, whirling around to face him with blazing eyes. “Don’t say another word, Mr. Howe.”
She deliberately used his formal name, each syllable driving a deeper wedge between them with calculated precision.
“I’m grateful for everything you’ve done for me. Truly grateful. But Alex—I refuse to owe you anything more. Please, just leave now.”
Step into new worlds at g ? lnσ ν ?s?conn
With those final words, she turned away completely, refusing to look at him or speak another syllable.
Alex felt his heart shatter into countless fragments, each piece cutting him from within.
Raw pain blazed across his chest and etched itself into his features, every word from her mouth carving deep wounds in his soul.
He had sacrificed so much, given everything he could offer. Why couldn’t she recognize the depth of his devotion?
Noah—always Noah! That man still occupied every corner of her heart and soul, leaving no room for anyone else.
Alex walked toward the door, stealing glances over his shoulder with every reluctant step he took.

###Chapter XXX:
Once in the hallway, he pressed his back against the cold wall, despair settling over his features like a heavy shadow.
Initially, he had resisted pushing too aggressively, willing to step back and wait patiently as long as Sadie showed even the smallest willingness to give him a chance, as long as the thinnest sliver of hope remained alive.
Now, it appeared that only one final, desperate step remained in this tragic dance between them.
He departed from the hospital with a heart weighed down by sorrow, his solitary figure gradually swallowed by the harsh, unforgiving glow of the corridor lights.
Back in the hospital ward, Sadie paced with restless energy, her thoughts tangled in chaos. Something serious had happened to Wall Group.
Alex’s ominous words echoed in her mind like a persistent alarm, refusing to be silenced no matter how hard she tried to dismiss them.
She drew a steadying breath and reached for her phone to call Blaine. The phone rang endlessly, each tone stretching her nerves tighter before someone finally answered.
“Hello?” Blaine’s voice carried bone-deep exhaustion, laced with barely concealed nervousness that he struggled to mask.
He attempted casual conversation with obviously forced ease. “Sadie? What’s happening? Shouldn’t you be resting right now?”
Sadie bypassed pleasantries entirely. “Where are you right now?”
Blaine obviously hadn’t anticipated such directness from her. He stumbled over his words, mumbling vague explanations about being buried in work. Sadie’s brow creased with deeper concern. “Are you concealing something from me? What exactly is happening at the company?”
When he realized that concealment was no longer possible, Blaine released one heavy sigh after another, each breath carrying the weight of his reluctant confession.
He understood Sadie’s persistent nature intimately—he might delay the inevitable for a short while, but not for long.
“Several shareholders began creating problems after news leaked that Noah’s still alive,” he finally admitted. “But don’t worry—I’ve managed to keep things under control.”
He attempted to make the situation sound manageable, desperately hoping she wouldn’t spiral into excessive worry.
Mσrε υpdαтes ιn Gαlnσνels.cσm
“Listen, let’s not discuss this right now. I’ve got several urgent matters to handle. We’ll talk later.”
Before Sadie could probe deeper with more questions, the line went completely dead, leaving her holding a silent phone. Sadie’s frown carved deeper lines into her face, and the churning unease in her stomach intensified with each passing moment.
Shareholders creating disturbances was definitely far more complicated and dangerous than Blaine’s casual explanation suggested.noveldrama
Malcolm’s unexpected return served as an ominous warning sign that couldn’t be ignored. The corporate vultures were already circling overhead, waiting for their opportunity to strike.

###Chapter XXX:
Early discharge had become an absolute necessity. Wall Group couldn’t afford to spiral any deeper into chaos without her direct intervention.
Meanwhile, across town, Blaine answered another call—this one from his bodyguard.
Though his voice maintained its steady tone, a brief flash of impatience swept across his features like storm clouds gathering on the horizon.
“Any progress on your end? Have you managed to fix that phone yet?”
Jack’s shattered phone could contain vital clues that might unlock this entire mystery, and Blaine found himself running desperately short on precious time.
Silence stretched uncomfortably on the other end of the line before the bodyguard finally gathered enough courage to deliver his report.
“Mr. Castro, the phone remains completely non-functional. The replacement parts are incredibly specialized and hard to source. And… we just received disturbing news from the hospital—Stan might not survive the night. The doctors say he’s experiencing what they call a brief rally before the final decline.”
Blaine’s fingers tightened around the phone until his knuckles turned white, his heart plummeting into his stomach. This development spelled nothing but trouble, and he struggled to suppress the rising wave of dread that threatened to overwhelm his chest.
“Understood. I’m heading there immediately.” Whatever the true situation might be, he needed to witness it firsthand rather than rely on secondhand reports.
If Stan had genuinely regained consciousness, even for the briefest of moments, he might still possess enough strength to reveal something crucial about what had transpired.
Thirty minutes later, Blaine strode through the entrance of the hospital’s intensive care unit, his footsteps echoing ominously through the sterile corridors.
The atmosphere hung thick with the acrid scent of industrial disinfectant, so potent that it burned his nostrils and made his lungs protest with each breath.
A weary doctor stood sentinel at the entrance and immediately stepped forward with an expression of profound gravity etched into his weathered features.
“Mr. Castro, thank God you’ve arrived.”
L?t?st ?hpt?rs ιn glnovе.
Blaine released a sharp, impatient breath while his brows drew together in visible frustration. This was definitely not the appropriate moment for polite pleasantries or meaningless small talk.
“Skip the formalities and get straight to the point. How is Stan’s condition right now?”
The doctor’s expression grew significantly darker as he slowly shook his head from side to side, deep regret carving painful lines across his tired features.
“The patient did briefly regain consciousness about an hour ago, but unfortunately, all his vital signs have dropped to dangerously critical levels. I’m deeply afraid… he doesn’t have much time remaining.”
Those devastating words struck Blaine with the force of an icy tidal wave, instantly extinguishing the last flickering ember of hope that had been burning stubbornly in his chest.
He had far too many unanswered questions and dangling loose threads in this complex web of mystery—and Stan perhaps possessed the knowledge to weave them together into a coherent picture. If Stan died now, the investigation trail would freeze solid once again.

###Chapter XXX:
Blaine delivered a curt, tight nod while his facial features hardened into a mask of grim determination. “Take me to him immediately.”noveldrama
Following the doctor’s brisk pace through an endless maze of sterile, fluorescent-lit corridors, he finally crossed the threshold into Stan’s ward. As he drew closer to Stan’s bedside with purposeful strides, Blaine suddenly froze mid-step, something unexpected catching his sharp attention.
A young woman dressed in a pristine nurse’s uniform was awkwardly fumbling with a medical syringe, her visibly trembling hands struggling to inject some unknown substance into Stan’s pale, motionless arm.
Blaine’s brow furrowed with deep suspicion as warning bells began ringing in his mind. She didn’t look remotely familiar from his previous visits, and her nervous, furtive behavior immediately raised multiple red flags.
Sensing a presence behind her like a predator might sense danger, the nurse instantly froze in place—particularly when she felt the weight of Blaine’s sharp, penetrating gaze boring into her back.
She hastily bowed her head in submission and withdrew the syringe with a flurry of jerky, panicked movements that betrayed her obvious nervousness.
“Doctor, the adrenaline injection has been administered exactly as you requested.” Her voice emerged barely above a whisper, quivering with unmistakable fear. Then, keeping her head firmly down, she scurried out of the room like a frightened mouse.
Blaine’s calculating gaze remained fixed on her rapidly retreating figure for several long, contemplative moments.
Adrenaline injection? The explanation seemed medically reasonable enough. Blaine’s mind was far too consumed with Stan’s critical condition to pursue this particular thread any deeper.
Blaine moved with determined strides to the bedside where Stan lay frighteningly motionless, barely managing to cling to the thin thread of consciousness. His lips appeared severely parched and cracked, his complexion had turned ghostly pale, and his eyes remained only half-open in a glassy, unfocused stare.
Stan was murmuring something almost inaudibly under his labored breath, the words barely escaping his dry lips. “Mr. Howe… Mr. Howe…”
Blaine’s heart gave a violent jolt of recognition at those whispered words. He leaned in closer, straining every fiber of his being to catch each precious syllable while anxiety coursed through his veins. He began gently patting Stan’s frail shoulder.
“Stan—Stan! Stay with me and talk to me. What exactly happened to you? How did everything spiral into this nightmare?”
Updates loaded at gσv?s.co
Stan appeared to summon every last reserve of strength that remained in his failing body. With agonizing slowness, he managed to turn his head toward Blaine, his bloodshot eyes swimming with pure, undiluted terror.
His voice cracked and broke like fragile glass as he struggled to choke out the words that seemed to tear at his very soul.
“It was… it was…”
Stan appeared to wrestle with words of crucial importance, yet his lips merely quivered helplessly, unable to form even a single coherent sentence. Blaine suspended his breathing entirely, every muscle taut with anticipation as he waited for the revelation.

###Chapter 1182:
Before Stan could complete his thought, however, his head collapsed sideways against the pillow, and consciousness abandoned him entirely.
In that precise instant, the heart monitor stationed beside the bed erupted into a shrill, ear-splitting wail that sliced through the sterile air.
The jagged line that had previously danced with irregular heartbeats now stretched into a merciless, unforgiving flat line. “Beeeeeep—”
Blaine’s mind reeled in confusion, his thoughts spinning wildly while panic surged through his chest like a tidal wave threatening to drown him.
Pure instinct propelled Blaine forward as he seized Stan’s shoulders with desperate hands, shaking the unconscious man with fierce determination.
“Stan! Stay with me! Tell me who did this to you!”
The doctor’s face drained of all color as he rushed across the room to examine Stan with urgent, practiced movements.
He bent close to detect any whisper of breath, then carefully lifted Stan’s eyelids to peer into pupils that would reveal the truth.
Agonizing seconds crawled by before the doctor finally raised his head, his expression carved from stone and bearing the weight of finality.
“Mr. Castro…” The doctor’s voice carried the devastating weight of loss. “I’m deeply sorry. He’s passed away.”
Reality refused to register in Blaine’s mind as he stumbled backward, his legs threatening to buckle beneath the crushing weight of this impossible truth.
Stan had indeed experienced that final surge of clarity that sometimes graced the dying, yet he hadn’t managed to voice even a complete thought before death claimed him with merciless swiftness.
The realization struck Blaine like a physical blow—that nurse, the one who had administered what she claimed was an adrenaline injection to Stan.
Ice-cold understanding blazed through Blaine’s consciousness with the force of lightning, transforming his features into a mask of deadly comprehension.
“Damn…”
“It all!” The curse tore from his throat as he pivoted sharply and bolted from the ICU with explosive speed.

The corridor stretched before him in mocking emptiness—the nurse had evaporated into thin air, leaving not even a whisper of her presence behind. Blaine dug his fingertips into his temples, fury and frustration warring within him as the bitter truth settled in—he had allowed his quarry to escape through his very grasp.
His trembling fingers fumbled for his phone before jabbing at his bodyguard’s number with barely controlled desperation.
The instant the connection crackled to life, commands erupted from his lips with military precision.
“Lock down this entire building immediately! Every exit, every entrance—secure them all! No one leaves this place! Locate the nurse who just exited Stan’s room—use any means necessary!”
The bodyguard recognized the lethal urgency in his employer’s voice and responded without hesitation or inquiry.
Blaine terminated the call before driving his fist into the unforgiving hospital wall.noveldrama

###Chapter 1183:
Someone had executed their plan directly beneath his watchful gaze, and now that mysterious nurse had become his primary target.
What devastating secret had Stan possessed that someone deemed worthy of murder to protect?
Did this connect to the shadowy figures who had taken Hailey?noveldrama
Had Stan accidentally uncovered knowledge so threatening it had sealed his fate?
Regardless of the specific truth, one fact crystallized with brutal clarity—this conspiracy ran far deeper than he had ever conceived, and finding that elusive nurse represented his only path to answers.
Blaine’s gaze hardened into glacial steel, cold enough to freeze blood in veins.
Meanwhile, Alex burst through the front entrance of his opulent villa and staggered inside. He collapsed onto the buttery leather sofa, every ounce of energy drained from his exhausted frame.
The polished, sophisticated gentleman he had presented to Sadie had crumbled away entirely, leaving only raw desperation in its wake.
His face twisted into a thunderous scowl as he tore the silk tie from his throat, seized a crystal bottle of aged whiskey from the mahogany cabinet, and pressed it directly to his lips.
The liquid fire scorching down his throat failed to quell the tempest raging within his chest, so he tilted the bottle again, his features growing darker and more menacing with each swallow.
At that precise moment, Egan Palmer, the usually composed butler, exploded through the doorway with panic written across his weathered features. “Sir, we’ve got a serious situation!”
Alex lowered the whiskey bottle slowly, deep furrows carving themselves into his forehead. “Just tell me what’s happened.”
Alex wondered grimly what catastrophe could possibly eclipse the devastation of Sadie’s complete rejection.
Egan delivered the crushing news with professional efficiency— their operative stationed at the hospital had just reported that Stan had experienced an unexpected surge of consciousness and awakened from his coma.
The revelation slammed into Alex’s solar plexus with the devastating force of a heavyweight boxer’s finishing blow.

The crystal bottle tumbled from his nerveless fingers, striking the rug with a muffled impact as expensive whiskey soaked into the intricate fibers. He rocketed upright from the sofa, shock and disbelief etched into every line of his pale face like a grotesque mask.
Alex’s mind reeled with furious questions— how had that worthless Stan managed to regain consciousness when death had seemed inevitable? And more critically, had he revealed any of their secrets?
“Give me the complete status report immediately—did he manage to speak?”
Egan’s eyes fell to the floor as his voice descended to barely above a whisper. “You can rest easy, sir. Our operative reached him before any damage could be done— Stan never uttered a single syllable before his heart stopped permanently.”
Relief flooded through Alex’s system like morphine, and he collapsed back onto the leather cushions as his legs gave way beneath him.

###Chapter 1184:
A shuddering exhalation escaped his lips while beads of nervous perspiration clung to his forehead like dewdrops.
The margin for disaster had been razor-thin—a single miscalculation would have incinerated his careful planning and left nothing but ashes.
Alex’s thoughts turned venomous as he contemplated Stan’s demise— that bumbling incompetent had finally served a useful purpose by dying.
Alex dragged his sleeve across his damp forehead, and the familiar chill of strategic thinking crystallized once again behind his eyes.
“Killing Stan was not enough,” Alex declared with arctic precision. “Jack remains problematic—he knows too much and poses a continuing threat. Eliminate him with surgical efficiency—no witnesses, no evidence, no errors.”
Alex understood that Jack possessed dangerous knowledge that could destroy everything—should Sadie’s or Noah’s operatives discover what Jack knew, the resulting explosion would consume them all.
“Perfectly understood, sir.” Egan inclined his head with the deference of a seasoned professional. “I’ll handle this matter with immediate attention.”
Having received his orders, Egan pivoted smoothly and departed the room with purposeful, measured strides that spoke of deadly intent.
Blaine’s men had combed through every corner of the hospital, yet the fake nurse had vanished completely.
She had disappeared without leaving behind even the faintest clue—like morning mist evaporating into thin air.
Vanishing so quickly and smoothly in such a short time? That couldn’t possibly be mere chance.
This had been a carefully planned killing, without the slightest doubt.
Blaine’s face turned stormy while his hands balled into fists so tight that his knuckles popped like breaking twigs.
Someone possessed the sheer nerve to commit murder directly beneath his watch—then melted away without leaving behind even a fingerprint.
The act stood as a brazen insult to his power, and he refused to allow such disrespect to pass unanswered. If these killers had possessed the boldness to strike at Stan, then Jack might easily become their next victim.noveldrama
1E$? €?S 1? gɑlοv?l?.сo
Every fiber of Blaine’s being shrieked warnings of an approaching threat. Ice-cold dread crawled up his backbone, racing from his toes all the way to the top of his skull.
Hesitation had become a luxury he could no longer afford. Without wasting another second, he spun around and marched away with determined steps.
Beyond the entrance to Jack’s private room, Blaine had positioned his most reliable security team. He had commanded them to maintain constant vigilance around the clock, never allowing their attention to waver for even a heartbeat.
The hallway stretched before them, wrapped in thick, oppressive quiet. Multiple guards held their positions like statues, their posture sharp and ready. As he witnessed this scene, Blaine’s wound-tight anxiety loosened just a fraction. For the moment, at least, Jack remained protected.
.

###Chapter 1185:
A guard spotted Blaine advancing with thunder written across his features and immediately moved closer, choosing his words with careful precision.
“Mr. Castro, we’ve kept the hospital sealed for several hours now. The director just delivered a message asking when normal activities can restart.”
Blaine pressed his fingers against his temples while exhaustion carved deep lines across his features.
Maintaining the hospital’s lockdown forever simply wasn’t possible. Eventually, such measures would trigger widespread fear among patients and staff.
“Inform the director that he can end the lockdown,” he commanded. After a brief moment, his voice grew razor-sharp. “Also, make sure the technical team puts Jack’s phone at the top of their list. I need it functioning immediately.” That device could contain the answers to every question plaguing them.
Unknown to Blaine, just past the doorway leading to the emergency stairs, a man wearing a white medical coat had been quietly watching his every action. A cruel smile twisted his lips as the stranger dissolved into the darkness of the stairway.
Positioning himself next to the icy metal handrail, he retrieved his phone and entered a number with smooth, rehearsed movements.
Once the call went through, his tone lowered and became heavy with deference.
“Mr. Howe, Blaine has proven far more troublesome than we anticipated. He’s stationed numerous guards around Jack’s room—constant monitoring every hour of every day. We haven’t found any opportunity to make our move. Beyond that complication, he’s demanding that Jack’s phone be fixed quickly. It appears he believes the device contains crucial information. If we attempt anything now, we might reveal our entire operation.”noveldrama
At the other end of the line, Alex’s eyebrows pulled together into a deep, angry crease.
Blaine. That rich boy who typically spent his time wasting money and chasing pleasure—and now, he dared to destroy his carefully laid schemes?
Did that conceited idiot truly believe that carrying the Castro family name would protect him from consequences?
A spark of deadly determination blazed in Alex’s gaze. He had poured too much effort and plotting into this scheme to watch it crumble at this crucial moment.

If Blaine continued forcing himself into this dangerous situation, then he would need to be removed permanently as well.
Alex ground his teeth together while his voice plummeted to a bone-chilling whisper.
“If circumstances demand it… eliminate Blaine completely.”
Once he was committed to this path, there could be no half-measures or retreat.
The physician on the receiving end trembled violently, almost losing his grip on the device.
Blaine represented far more than an ordinary target—he stood as the only heir to the Castro family, Ralph’s beloved grandson. Harming Blaine would be equivalent to launching an assault against the entire Castro dynasty.
If Ralph, the mythical family head who had retired long ago, were to emerge because of this incident, the resulting devastation would be beyond comprehension.

###Chapter 1186:
“Mr. Howe, please reconsider this decision!” the doctor said, his voice shaking like autumn leaves. “He’s the Castro family’s heir. If we touch him, Ralph Castro—”
“Silence!” Alex barked, his voice sharp enough to slice through steel. “This remains our only option. Every person who blocks my path will be destroyed!”
Alex’s breath came in rapid bursts, yet his voice maintained its frozen edge. Blaine had invited this disaster upon himself. If Blaine had simply minded his own business, such extreme measures would never have become necessary. However, retreat had become impossible at this point. He could never allow Sadie to uncover the reality of what had happened. Not at this moment. Not at any future time.
The physician sensed frozen terror crawling up his back. He couldn’t summon the courage to continue his protests.noveldrama
“Understood, Mr. Howe.” His words emerged parched and unwilling, but he surrendered to the inevitable.
He ended the call, gulping down his fear while struggling to steady his unraveling composure.
Step by careful step, he stepped out from the darkness of the stairway.
In the meantime, countless hours of frantic activity mixed with crushing pressure had finally overwhelmed Blaine’s endurance.
His sight whirled in dizzying circles. The floor seemed to shift and roll beneath him. Crushed by complete fatigue, his frame wobbled dangerously as he fought to remain standing.
The physician noticed and hurried forward to support Blaine’s faltering form.
“Mr. Castro, are you feeling well?” His tone held precisely the correct amount of worry. “Your appearance suggests illness. Maybe you ought to take some time to recover?”
Blaine dismissed the man with a sharp gesture, annoyance flashing across his features.
“I’m perfectly fine.”
No sooner had the sentence slipped past Blaine’s lips than a fresh surge of vertigo overwhelmed him.
Find magical tales on gα?ησν?s?c?
His knees gave way, leaving him no option but to let the physician guide him into a nearby chair.
One catastrophe followed another in a relentless chain—where was the chance to breathe?
Stan was gone. Jack remained comatose. His mobile—wrecked. Any potential leads it carried were now out of reach.
Noticing Blaine’s condition, the doctor spoke again, his voice edged with concern. “Mr. Castro, pushing yourself like this will wear you down. Why don’t I set up a room so you can get some proper rest?”
Blaine scowled. “Do I look like I’ve got room to rest right now? I’m already drowning in chaos.”
By his side, the doctor’s fingers curled slowly into a tight fist.
He couldn’t move forward. As long as Blaine lingered here, everything he’d planned was stalled.

###Chapter 1187:
After a moment, he eased his grip and adopted a professional demeanor once more.
“In that case, how about this—I give you an injection of high-concentration vitamins. It’ll bring clarity and help stabilize your energy.”
Still lightheaded, Blaine latched onto the idea, desperate to function again.
It sounded harmless enough. He nodded weakly. “Fine. Just hurry up.”
The doctor adjusted his spectacles, something unreadable flickering behind the lenses. “Certainly, Mr. Castro. I’ll have it ready in just a moment.” Turning on his heel, he strode toward the dispensary.
The attending nurse looked up as he entered. “Do you need something, Dr. Holland?”
Her question hit Lenny Holland like a pin to the chest. Guilt flitted across his face, though he kept his eyes on the floor.
“I need a high-concentration vitamin compound,” he said calmly.
The nurse turned to the medicine cabinet and asked casually as she searched, “What’s it for?”
Lenny’s tone didn’t waver. “Mr. Castro requested a fast-acting energy solution.”
The nurse nodded and retrieved a sealed vial of vitamins, handing it over. “Oh, and Doctor—just remembered—Mr. Castro has a documented allergy to iodine. Just so you’re aware.”
Lenny’s grip faltered for a split second as he accepted the vial. “Appreciate it,” he replied smoothly. “I’ll take caution.”
He turned, concealing his unease, though perspiration had already begun to soak his shirt. His hands were clammy.
Blaine couldn’t tolerate iodine—but a small dose likely wouldn’t kill him. At worst, it would provoke a severe reaction—maybe enough to knock him out.
Eliminate the heir to the Castro family? Lenny wouldn’t dare. But Alex’s command weighed heavily.
He was already in too deep. This was the point of no return. He had to take the risk!
Tray in hand, Lenny returned briskly down the hallway.

Blaine sat slouched, lids barely open, chest rising and falling with shallow breaths—barely conscious. A jolt of panic climbed Lenny’s throat. He gently nudged Blaine’s shoulder.noveldrama
“Mr. Castro? Can you hear me?”
Silence.
His gaze dropped to the cotton ball soaked in iodine on the tray.
Jaw tightening, he grabbed the tweezers, pulled up Blaine’s sleeve, and dabbed his arm with the iodine.
Blaine twitched faintly at the cold contact.
Without hesitating, Lenny tore the syringe from its packaging and pierced the skin.
The liquid flowed in—seamless. Not a hitch.
Withdrawing the needle, he applied gauze to the spot. His fingers trembled.

###Chapter 1188:
Sweat ran down his temple.
He swept the area quickly, ready to slip out unnoticed.
Bang!
The tray slipped from his shaking hands and crashed to the floor, scattering glass and metal instruments in every direction.
Lenny spun around, heart in his throat.
Blaine had collapsed onto the floor, his body sprawled out. His skin was erupting in blotches—red welts racing across his arms and neck. Several guards in black sprinted over. One glance at Blaine, and their expressions turned lethal.
“What the hell did you inject into Mr. Castro?”
Lenny’s knees nearly buckled. His voice barely found its way out.
“H-He’s having an allergic reaction! We need to act now! Emergency room—immediately!”
The guards hesitated. Just moments ago, Blaine had been conscious. Now this? Lenny’s pulse pounded in his ears as their delay stretched the moment. A chilling sweat drenched his spine.
“Reactions like this can be caused by various triggers! We won’t know until we run diagnostics—but if we wait, he could die!”
The lead bodyguard’s glare could’ve sliced steel. Stan’s death still lingered like smoke. Trust was extinct. But Blaine’s survival came first.
Grinding his teeth, the man barked, “Get Mr. Castro to the ER! Now!”
Then he turned to Lenny, his voice like ice. “You better pray he survives this.”
“If you dare consider playing games or nurturing dangerous ideas, the entire Castro family will transform your existence into an endless nightmare.”
Lenny shook violently from his scalp to his toes, completely frozen by the menacing words. His face lost every trace of color, becoming pale as death itself.noveldrama
His mouth opened slightly, yet no words emerged from his throat. He could manage nothing except desperate nodding in fearful surrender.
Sixty minutes passed before the earliest rays of morning began painting the horizon beyond the windows.

The crimson warning light mounted above the emergency room door finally flickered off.
Blaine had been dragged back from death’s doorway. However, his eyelids stayed shut—he had fallen into a profound, unconscious state.
Lenny stripped away his surgical mask with weary fingers. Despite fatigue carving deep lines across his features, his voice held firm and controlled.
“Mr. Castro has escaped immediate peril, but his situation remains fragile and unpredictable. He requires transfer to the intensive care unit immediately for continuous, around-the-clock observation.”
The chief bodyguard, Trevor Jimenez, positioned himself beyond the entrance of Blaine’s ward, studying the scene through the transparent barrier. His eyes remained fixed on the colorless, still form lying within.
After verifying that Blaine’s life signs had steadied for the moment, he permitted himself one small exhale of comfort.

###Chapter 1189:
He rotated toward the physician, his tone remaining ice-cold. “Thank you.”
Lenny lifted a quivering hand in swift acknowledgment, clearly still rattled by recent events. “Simply performing my duties.”noveldrama
Trevor’s iron-hard stare remained focused on Lenny for several heartbeats before he quietly observed the doctor departing, his steps unsteady and uncertain.
Trevor wondered whether Blaine’s severe allergic episode had genuinely occurred by pure chance.
Without Lenny’s rapid choice to summon emergency medical assistance, the outcome might have proven absolutely devastating.
However, with Stan’s recent tragedy still burning vividly in everyone’s memory, Trevor refused to drop his vigilance—not even for an instant. Something about this particular physician struck him as fundamentally wrong.
His gaze became sharp as a blade’s edge. Angling his head just a fraction, he whispered precise instructions to a reliable assistant.
“Assign several men to follow Dr. Holland constantly, every hour of every day.
I demand surveillance on his every action. Also, increase the protection around Mr. Castro—absolutely nothing could penetrate our defenses.”
Should any harm befall Blaine, not one of them would survive to witness another sunrise.
“Understood, sir.” The assistant’s face grew solemn as he absorbed the command and departed to execute it without hesitation.
The remaining guards, their expressions tight with anxiety, remained frozen at the intensive care unit doorway like carved stone figures.
In the meantime, Lenny navigated through the hospital’s twisting hallways until he ducked into a deserted emergency stairwell.
He pressed his full weight against the frigid wall, his legs threatening to collapse under the strain.
Gasping for air, he gripped his chest desperately. Droplets of icy perspiration streamed down from his brow, carving trails across his cheeks before splashing onto the dirty concrete below.
The entire ordeal had brought him dangerously near disaster. His pulse continued hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird.
Fortunately, his mind had worked quickly—he had labeled it an allergic episode and rushed Blaine into emergency treatment.
Through this approach, he had fulfilled Alex’s demands while ensuring Blaine remained alive.
Both Alex and the Castro family lacked any motive to pursue him with vengeance. He had managed to preserve his own life by the narrowest of margins.
Using shaking hands, Lenny searched for his phone and entered digits he had memorized perfectly.
The call went through within seconds of dialing.
“Yes?” Alex’s tone emerged quiet and frozen like winter wind.
Lenny attempted to control the tremor in his words. “Mr. Howe, the task has been completed. Blaine remains breathing, but he’s trapped in unconsciousness and probably won’t awaken for quite some time.”
.

###Chapter 1190:
A short pause followed—merely several heartbeats, yet to Lenny, those moments stretched like hours. His breathing stopped completely in his windpipe.
Then Alex spoke once more, his words heavy with pleased approval. “Alright, excellent work. Your payment will appear in your bank account very soon.”
Lenny experienced the crushing weight in his ribcage finally lifting. “I’m grateful, Mr. Howe! Deeply grateful! Should you ever require additional services, merely speak the request—I’ll accomplish anything you demand.”
Alex offered no reply. The connection ended abruptly with a sharp click.
Lenny gazed at the device’s display briefly, then allowed his body to sink gradually onto the cold surface, his back resting against the wall. He had barely escaped a potentially fatal situation.
At the same time, at his own villa, Alex placed his phone down carefully. His elegant fingers rotated the crimson liquid within his crystal goblet using measured, intentional movements.
The deep red wine caught the illumination, reflecting bright sparks into his gaze—peaceful on the surface, yet threaded with chilled contentment.
The entire scheme had represented a dangerous risk, without question. However, it had produced results—Blaine lay helpless and unconscious. Nothing else held any importance.
The plan had demanded courage and calculation. Yet, if such actions would steal Sadie from Noah permanently, every danger had been worthwhile.
At that precise moment, rapid footfalls destroyed the peaceful silence that had filled the study.
Egan exploded through the doorway, his face drained of color and his chest heaving. “Sir! Sir—there’s a serious problem! It concerns Salex, he—”
Alex placed his wine glass onto the gleaming surface with a heavy, muffled sound.
Deep lines formed across his forehead as he gradually raised his eyes. “What has caused this frantic behavior? Express yourself with clarity.”
Egan gulped with difficulty, his voice wavering like wind through autumn leaves. “Salex has been weeping without pause since yesterday evening. Earlier today, his temperature soared dangerously high. Our doctor has examined him, yet no treatments have proven effective. The doctor explained that Salex remains too small, and now he requires—”

Egan’s words faded into silence, his shoulders contracting inward as he dropped his gaze toward the floor.noveldrama
Alex lifted himself from the rich leather seating, his towering figure casting a lengthy, intimidating silhouette across the entire chamber.
“Requires exactly what?”
A shudder ran through Egan’s body. He closed his eyes and braced himself before speaking.
“The doctor said that Salex needs his mother.”
Alex raised a brow at that.
Hailey? That woman—a mother?

###Chapter 1191:
His lips twitched in disdain.
And yet, the image of a feverish child, cheeks ruddy as he cried out in utter distress, appeared in his mind, unbidden and not all too welcome.
More importantly, the child looked just like Sadie.
But this wasn’t the time for sentiment.
He had laid out his plans with ruthless precision. As far as he was concerned, there was no room for error, no matter how trivial. Sadie, the Wall Group—he was going to have both.
Still, a sick and fussy baby was a problem, indeed.
After a moment’s contemplation, Alex said, “Bring her here. But be sure to keep her under constant watch. She must be within sight twenty-four-seven. And if she tries anything…”noveldrama
Alex’s gaze suddenly sharpened, like a cold and deadly blade laced with poison. “Don’t bother keeping her alive.”
Egan felt another chill run up his spine, rooting him to the spot. “Yes, Sir.” He cautiously lifted his head and stole a glance at the man before him.
Alex was no longer the melancholic and tender young man he remembered. Somewhere along the way, Alex had become a stranger, and a ruthless and terrifying one at that.
Egan’s heart twisted at the thought, but he knew better than to voice his opinions. He offered a bow, then retreated from the room.
Hours later, the suffocating tension in the villa had finally lifted, if only a little. Egan returned to the study, his gait noticeably lighter this time.
“Sir, Salex’s fever has broken. He is sleeping peacefully now.”
Alex was standing in front of the window, staring at the dark stretch of the night outside.
He turned and nodded at the news. A knot had loosened inside his chest. It was a good thing that Salex had finally calmed down. It was one less thing to deal with.
It took Alex a few more seconds to realize that Egan was still in the room. “What is it?”
Stories live now on galnσ?o
“Sir,” Egan said respectfully, “Ms. Burgess is asking to see you.”
Alex let out a soft, derisive snort.
Hailey just didn’t know when to quit, did she? Did she really think that playing nurse for a few hours would change anything?
Alex had to admit, however—her persistence was somewhat intriguing. What sort of trick was she trying to pull this time?
“Send her in.”
Moments later, the heavy study door creaked open once again.
Hailey stumbled inside, having been shoved by two grim-faced bodyguards assigned to keep watch over her.
Her hands were tied tightly behind her back with a coarse rope. In contrast to her usually polished appearance, her hair was now a tangled mess, and her face was pale and gaunt after several days of confinement.

###Chapter 1192:
But when her eyes fell on the aloof man on the sofa, a hint of vitriol flickered in her eyes, so fast that it was gone in a second.
Hailey immediately schooled her features, softening them into a pitiful expression. Her shoulders trembled in a show of pain and fear.
She looked like a frail and disheveled girl who had been gravely wronged by someone powerful.
Alex took one look at her display, and his lips curled into a cruel smile. He swirled the wine glass he was holding and glanced at the burgundy liquid sloshing inside it.
“Your little act might work on Noah, Ms. Burgess,” he said in a deceptively soft voice that carried an undertone of danger. “But I’m afraid it’s wasted on me. What’s your angle this time? You should know by now that I am nothing like Noah. I don’t fall for this kind of petty trick. I suggest you be upfront and save both of our time. If you have something else up your sleeve…”
Alex paused and fixed his piercing gaze on Hailey’s face. “Well, you can’t blame me for what might happen next.”
Hailey shivered despite herself, her back suddenly breaking out in a cold sweat. Indeed, she had had enough time in the past few days to understand just what kind of person Alex was. He was stubborn and calculating, and he was completely merciless.
Once upon a time, Hailey had foolishly thought he was simply a man hopelessly trapped in his unrequited love for Sadie.noveldrama
Now, it was painfully clear that Alex had always been a wolf in sheep’s clothing. He was finally showing his true colors, and it turned out that he was far more difficult to handle than Noah.
No, not just difficult—this man was utterly dangerous!
Hailey’s hands balled into fists behind her back, her nails biting into her palms. She blinked and tried again, looking up at Alex with red, glassy eyes that swam with unshed tears.
“Mr. Howe, I… I was wrong. I know I made a mistake. But I swear, I never hurt the woman you love!”
Sadly, the words sounded hollow even to Hailey’s ears.

Alex let out a soft, humorless laugh that made her blood turn to ice.
“Oh, I know exactly what you did, Ms. Burgess. And what you tried to do.”
All at once, the air grew thick and oppressive.
“If Nathan hadn’t stepped in when he did…” Alex’s eyes narrowed into slits, his tone turning deadly as he continued, “Sadie would be dead by now. Shot on the spot. The truth is, my people were nearby the whole time. They saw everything.”
Hailey practically felt the color drain from her face. She thought she had covered her tracks well.
Hailey stood paralyzed, disbelief surging through her. So Alex had been aware the whole time—he’d planted informants right under her nose.
Rising from the cushions with eerie calm, Alex strode toward her, every movement filled with chilling intent. Once in front of her, he loomed, eyes glinting with malice.
“Sparing your life? That’s me being merciful. Why bother?” A wicked curve formed on his lips.

###Chapter 1193:
“Because I could use a little lapdog.”
Suddenly, his hand shot up and clamped around her jaw.
The pressure was unbearable; she let out a muffled whimper. But the glare in his eyes rooted her in place like ice in her veins.
He forced her chin up, examining her features with unsettling focus.
“This face… looks about eighty percent like Sadie,” he murmured, tracing a path across her cheek with a ghost of a touch, though his expression stayed as frozen as ever.
Hailey’s hands balled into fists, nails digging so deep into her palms they nearly broke the skin.
Mortification surged through her—a raw, searing shame, unlike anything she’d ever known.
She was the heiress of the Burgess family. A remarkable doctor at Rosewood Hospital. When had anyone ever dared humiliate her like this?
But she didn’t lash out. She couldn’t even afford to let resentment show.
Alex wasn’t merely cold-hearted—he was deranged. A beast draped in skin. If she pushed him too far, she was certain he’d end her life without a second thought.
His obsession with Sadie ran deeper than infatuation—it blurred the line between love and mania. Still, no matter how far he went, Sadie refused to be with her.
But Hailey refused to crumble beneath this. She wasn’t anyone’s puppet.
She had only one card left—and she was ready to play it.noveldrama
Without warning, she reached out and clasped the same hand that had just cut off her air moments ago.
Drawing it slowly to her face, she pressed it to her cheek, lips curling into a practiced, delicate smile. Her words came out hushed, trembling by design.
“If…”
“This is the face you want, Mr. Howe… then I’ll stay. I’ll stay with you.” Her voice wavered, deliberately frail. Tears hovered on her lashes.
“You despise Noah, don’t you? He nearly killed you. I can’t stand him either. Tossed me aside like I was meaningless. Looks like we’ve got a common enemy, don’t we?”
Fresh content live on gα?ησvls?c?m
Alex’s gaze narrowed, fixed on the near-replica of the woman he loved, now putting on this pitiful charade—and something sickened him.
With a snap of revulsion, he jerked his hand free and shoved her away. Hailey staggered, barely staying upright.
“You want to take Sadie’s place? Don’t kid yourself.”
His words were laced with venom. He sneered.
“But Salex needs a mother. So you’re not going anywhere.”
His voice dropped an octave—dangerous, menacing. “I’ll have you watched nonstop. One misstep, and you already know the consequences.”
Hailey’s stomach twisted. She dropped her gaze, the fire in her eyes carefully veiled.

###Chapter 1194:
“Yes, Mr. Howe,” she murmured.
Two guards approached and silently escorted her from the room.noveldrama
Alex slumped into the couch. He swirled the wine in his glass but had lost any desire to drink.
Noah’s fate still hung in limbo. Whether he would ever regain consciousness remained uncertain.
Alex had eyes planted at the hospital day and night. Nothing would escape him.
At Jazmah Hopevale Hospital,
Sadie was being discharged today.
She needed to return to the company and take control of the chaos.
Wall Group had been Noah’s life’s work. It was also a symbol of pride for both her grandfather and Nigel. She wouldn’t allow it to collapse under her watch.
She moved efficiently, gathering her belongings into a small bag when she noticed Tina nearby, her brows drawn together in annoyance.
Usually lively and full of chatter, Tina now wore a frown and looked deflated.
Sadie’s expression softened as she approached, her voice light. “What’s wrong? Our little burst of sunshine looks awfully cloudy.”
Tina gave a dramatic pout.
“Sadie, you won’t believe it. Blaine is the absolute worst!” she exclaimed, cheeks puffing with frustration.
“He got some weird allergic reaction to vitamins last night and now he’s stuck in a hospital bed. That’s what he gets for messing around constantly!” Tina slapped the nearest plant leaf as if it were Blaine himself.
Sadie couldn’t help but chuckle at her antics.
“If you’re so concerned, just admit it. I promise I won’t tease.”
She paused, then added with a gentle note, “There’s no rush here. You should drop by and see him. He’s done a lot for us lately.”
Tina’s eyes lit up briefly—then she quickly turned away, pink rising in her cheeks.
L?tτ чh?ρτ?r? ιn gɑlοv?l?.сo
“Sadie! Don’t be ridiculous! Blaine flirts with everything that breathes. I’m sure there’s already a crowd of admirers at his bedside. Why would I even consider going? As if!”
Sadie watched her flustered reaction with growing amusement, the corner of her lips tugging upward.
She leaned in, her voice playful and low. “So you’re really not going?”
Tina inflated her cheeks and tilted her head to the side, eyes defiant, refusing to glance at Sadie or utter anything.
Her sulky stance had a charm to it. She always spoke with a sting, yet beneath it all, she was tenderhearted.
Sadie stifled a grin, gave a little cough, and adopted a tone of mock-authority. “Alright then. If that’s your attitude, as my assistant, you’ll be paying a courtesy call on our brave Mr. Castro on my behalf. This is part of your job.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1195:
Tina’s posture eased slightly. She darted a brief glance at Sadie, eyes flickering with consideration.
This sounded like a good excuse.
Sadie nudged her gently.
“Just go. This is your new assignment. And if you stall, I’m deducting from your salary.”
Tina bobbed her head rapidly.
“Understood, Ms. Hudson! I’ll handle it right away!”
She bolted from the space with lightning speed, her excitement radiating even in her exit.
Observing Tina’s hasty departure, Sadie let out a soft laugh. There was something irresistibly sweet about Tina.
With a slight shake of her head, she grabbed her purse from the couch and prepared to head out.
Suddenly, piercing sirens shrieked from the room beside hers.
Sadie froze.
Noah!
She acted on instinct, spinning around without hesitation.
She stormed into the neighboring chamber. The sight inside drained the color from her face.
Noah was lying still on the bed, his once strong, graceful features rapidly losing hue. The monitor tracking his vitals beeped alarmingly, his heart rate nearing a flat line.
“Code blue! Patient’s in ventricular fibrillation!”
“Defibrillator—now!”
“Administer one amp of adrenaline, immediately!”
Medical staff had surged into the room, clipped commands flying through the air as pressure mounted like a thunderstorm.
g?lnσν?s﹒, the heart of fiction
Sadie stood frozen, breath catching, her voice shaking.
“Doctor! What’s happening to him? Noah, he—”
The lead physician didn’t glance her way. His words were firm and grim.
“Ms. Hudson, Mr. Wall is in grave danger. We’re beginning resuscitation immediately. Please leave the room.”
What? Resuscitation? The term struck like a blow to the chest.
Sadie felt her knees weaken, a deafening buzz flooding her ears. Before she could , a nurse gently but firmly led her out. Bang! The door slammed behind her.
She stumbled backward, steadying herself against the icy corridor wall.
Every ounce of heat drained from her, replaced by a paralyzing frost.
No. This couldn’t be real.
She whispered a desperate plea, willing the universe to spare Noah. He had to wake up.

###Chapter 1196:
Her hands curled into fists, fingernails digging deep into her skin.
Without realizing it, she muttered under her breath, clinging to even a flicker of faith.
No! She refused to be idle. She had to do something!
Then it struck her. Hurst. If anyone could help in this nightmare, it was him.
She jerked her head up, resolve blazing in her expression. Without delay, she called her bodyguard.
“Bring Hurst to Jazmah Hopevale Hospital. Immediately.” She ended the call without another word.
Sadie stared at the sealed entrance, unmoving.
Thirty minutes crawled by. Finally, the door creaked open.
The attending physician emerged, forehead damp with sweat, his expression like stone.
When he saw Sadie, a flicker of pity crossed his features. His voice was rough.
“Ms. Hudson, Mr. Wall remains in critical condition. We’ve done everything we could, including administering adrenaline. Right now, it’s unclear if he’ll stabilize. If sheer determination can bring him back, that might give us a sliver of hope. Otherwise, we’ll need to consider alternative, more invasive measures. Do you consent?”
Each syllable cut deeper than the last. Sadie’s fingers tightened until her knuckles ached.
She tried to respond, but her throat constricted, aching with emotion.
Just then, the echo of measured footsteps reached her ears.
At the end of the corridor stood the man she had summoned—accompanied by the bodyguard.
It was Hurst, still in relaxed attire, his gaze calm, his demeanor unreadable. It was as though he’d known this moment was inevitable.
He approached, cracking his knuckles quietly, his stare meeting hers with unwavering calm.

“Ms. Hudson, looks like you’ve made up your mind.”
Sadie’s face darkened. She turned, her decision cemented.
For Noah’s sake, she had no other choice. Hurst was her last hope.
“Dr. Lawson, you claim to possess extraordinary abilities when it comes to preserving life.”
“Talk is cheap if you can’t follow through with your guarantee. If you want me to agree to your terms and work with you, you need to prove yourself first. Show me what you’ve got. Make me believe you’re worth the risk,” Sadie said.
A faint smile tugged at Hurst’s lips, one of amusement and quiet confidence. He casually held up his hands, carefree as ever. “Sure thing. That’s no problem at all.”
Indeed, this was just a piece of cake for him.
In fact, Hurst was already sauntering into Noah’s hospital room before the last word even left his mouth.
His easygoing demeanor was a stark contrast to the glum tension hanging in the air.noveldrama

###Chapter 1197:noveldrama
The attending physician looked stunned by the sudden intrusion.
What was going on? Who was this man? Judging by his clothes, he didn’t look like he was from Rosewood Hospital.
The physician was itching to ask and enlighten himself, but the oppressive aura coming off of Sadie stopped him cold.
She didn’t even spare him a glance.
Sadie stepped further into the room, her eyes fixed on Noah and Hurst. She brushed off the jumbled thoughts that raged inside her head and told herself to focus on the matter at hand.
The machines kept up their urgent, rhythmic beeping.
Hurst walked up to the crash cart and took a moment to survey the array of tools before picking up a slender, silver needle.
Under everyone’s watchful, uneasy eyes, he leaned over the bed.
Then, without a second’s hesitation, he drove the needle into the side of Noah’s ear in one swift, steady motion.
Sadie felt her heart clench so tight, she nearly cried out, but she managed to bite her lip at the last second.
She watched as Hurst’s fingers moved—precise, practiced—twisting and pulling with subtle flicks.
A thin stream of dark red blood seeped from the tail of the needle, which he calmly drew into an empty syringe with his other hand. Before long, the syringe was full.
Hurst set the needle and syringe neatly on a tray. From start to finish, his movements were quick and clean.
The attending physician stared in a mix of horror and disbelief, his heart pounding furiously inside his chest.
What sort of insane, reckless procedure had he just witnessed? For all intents and purposes, it looked like the stranger was toying with Noah’s life. If something went wrong, the hospital would no doubt be shut down.
The hapless man opened his mouth to protest, but no words came out. At the back of his mind, the voice of reason told him that interfering now could cause real, irreparable damage. He couldn’t afford to take any more risks.
The air in the room grew suffocating. Fifteen minutes crawled by in painful silence.

And then—a sudden coughing fit. Noah’s eyelashes fluttered, and his eyes slowly opened.
A faint flush crept back into his ghost-pale face.
He was awake.
A wave of joy and relief washed over Sadie. She rushed to the bedside, her voice shaking with emotion she could hardly contain.
“Noah! Noah, can you hear me? How are you feeling?”
Noah looked around the room, his gaze still glassy and unfocused.
Then his eyes landed on Sadie’s tear-streaked face.
It took a lot from him to reach out and take her hand. His grip was weak, yet firm at the same time.
.

###Chapter 1198:
Sadie choked on a sob as his fingers squeezed hers.
But the doctor’s warning from earlier lingered like a thorn stuck in her side. Even if Noah had woken up, he wouldn’t last long without the proper treatment. Not that Sadie would ever let that happen.noveldrama
“You’d better hang in there, Noah,” she muttered. “If you die on me, I swear I’ll marry Nathan and let him be Averi’s stepdad!”
Noah let out a short exhale, his lips curling into a faint smile. His voice was hoarse, but it still carried a bit of amusement.
“I wouldn’t dare disobey your orders, Ms. Hudson. I’ve certainly put you through a lot these past few days.”
Sadie’s nose stung with unshed tears. She had been prepared to give him a good scolding once he opened his eyes, but the words died in her throat.
Even in his critical state, Noah still had it in him to joke around.
But one look into his eyes had every last shred of her anger melting away. They were still a little glassy, but they carried that familiar spark that made Noah who he was.
“Don’t worry about anything else,” Sadie said, her voice softening without her even realizing it. “Just rest. I’ll take care of the rest.”
Then she turned to glare at Hurst, who had been watching quietly on the other side of the bed with an odd, unreadable calm.
He looked up, met her eyes, and smirked.
Hurst didn’t say a word as he followed Sadie out into the hallway, ignoring the curious glances that the hospital sent his way.
They stopped at a relatively empty spot. Hurst leaned against the wall and crossed his arms over his chest.
“So, Ms. Hudson,” he said, his eyes gleaming with amusement. “How did I do? I didn’t lie to you, did I?”
Sadie’s piercing eyes cut through his smug grin. “What is his current condition?”
Hurst raised his eyebrows, his smile dimming slightly.
g?lnσν?s?com, the heart of storytelling
“Mr. Wall was in critical condition before I arrived. If we had been a few minutes late, not even a miracle could have saved him.”
He paused to glance back toward Noah’s room.
“But now… he has an additional three days, at most.”
Three days… Those two words struck Sadie like a physical blow, each syllable hammering against her chest with relentless force.
Her fists clenched at her sides, crimson nails biting so deep into her palms that they nearly drew blood.
“Within three days,” she declared, turning to meet Hurst’s piercing stare, “I’ll deliver Stuart’s corpse to you. But if you even consider playing games with me…”
Her voice dropped to a bone-chilling whisper. “I’ll make certain you die in pieces.”
Hurst displayed no trace of fear. Instead, he offered a slight bow, every movement dripping with practiced elegance and calculated civility, his lips curling in a perfectly measured smile.

.
###Chapter 1199:
“Agreed. In business, we stake our reputation on honoring every commitment we make.”
Sadie fixed him with a withering glare, offered no further words, and strode away with unwavering determination.
Stuart’s location remained a mystery. Jazmah sprawled endlessly in all directions, and hunting down someone who was actively concealing themselves within just three days felt like searching for a single grain of sand on an endless beach.
But Noah’s life hung in the balance, each second slipping away.
A comprehensive manhunt was obviously impossible.
Time drained away like water through her fingers. Every heartbeat counted now—this had become a desperate race against death itself.
The only workable plan remaining was to lure Stuart into the open.
Stuart was ruthless and methodical. He never moved without having backup plans already in place.
Paranoid by nature, he treasured his reputation and his survival above everything else in this world.
He had gone to extraordinary lengths to wipe away every trace of his twin brother Hurst’s existence, crafting a perfect decoy to redirect any danger that might come his way.
A man of his suspicious nature would react violently to anything connected with the name “Dr. Lawson.”
If Stuart discovered that his meticulously constructed decoy—Hurst—had suddenly assumed the identity of “Dr. Lawson,” he would be unable to remain hidden. The revelation might even trigger enough panic to force him out of the shadows.
Sadie’s hands clenched once more, this time with deadly resolve. A dangerous fire ignited behind her eyes.
She stopped abruptly and barked a crisp order to Austen Figueroa, the lead bodyguard who had been following her like a shadow.
“Tell Samuel to spread word throughout the city that, in appreciation for Dr. Lawson’s life-saving treatment of Mr. Wall, the Wall Group has officially named Dr. Lawson as Chief Medical Consultant. A luxury private clinic will be established in his honor as a gesture of our profound gratitude. That recently vacated office building in the heart of downtown will be its location. The grand opening ceremony will commence at precisely ten o’clock tomorrow morning. Additionally, position every available operative in the field. Secure the entire area within a fifty-meter radius of the clinic. If anyone suspicious appears, eliminate them immediately. Don’t wait for my authorization.”
Austen’s face hardened with understanding. He grasped the gravity of the situation.
Iè$? ￠t?€я? 1n lπoνεl?.c
“Absolutely, Ms. Hudson. I’ll handle everything immediately!”
Without wasting another second, he spun around and departed at a swift pace. Sadie stood frozen in place, though her heart hammered wildly against her ribs. Cold sweat slicked her palms despite the cool air.
She had no way of knowing whether that cunning fox, Stuart, would actually fall for the trap. But given their desperate circumstances, no better strategy existed. This represented her best and perhaps only opportunity. She had to seize it—for Noah’s sake, failure was not an option.

###Chapter 1200:
On another floor of Jazmah Hopevale Hospital, just beyond the ICU doors, the air hung thick with the sharp smell of antiseptic.
Tina walked back and forth anxiously before the sealed double doors, her footsteps echoing in the sterile hallway.
When a doctor finally appeared through the doors, she hurried toward him.
“Dr. Holland, what’s Blaine’s condition? Is it possible for me to see him now?”
Lenny’s eyes shifted away, avoiding her gaze, his expression hidden behind the surgical mask.
“Visiting hours haven’t begun yet. The patient remains unconscious and continues to fight for his life in critical condition.” He hesitated, his voice becoming flat and dismissive.
“Seeing him right now is impossible. Perhaps you could return during proper visiting hours?”
Tina’s eyes stayed locked on the cold, sterile doors that separated her from Blaine.
It was supposed to be just a mild allergic reaction. How could Blaine still be unconscious? And in critical condition?
The metal band of Lenny’s watch glinted in the fluorescent light as he glanced at the time.
“Other patients require my immediate attention. If you’ll excuse me.” With those curt words, he hurried away down the corridor.
Tina’s brow furrowed with concern.
Something about that doctor struck her as wrong, though she couldn’t identify exactly what bothered her.
Perhaps she was simply letting her anxiety get the better of her.
She released a quiet sigh, her heart heavy with worry, and turned to leave, intending to report everything back to Sadie.
But as she turned around, she almost collided with someone standing behind her.
It was Trevor, Blaine’s head bodyguard, clutching a thermos that appeared to contain soup.

He blinked in surprise, clearly caught off guard by her presence.
“Miss Delgado? What brings you to this place? Has Ms. Hudson issued any fresh orders?”
Tina’s cheeks reddened, and she cleared her throat, attempting to hide her embarrassment.noveldrama
“Nothing specific, really. Ms. Hudson was deeply concerned about Mr. Castro’s well-being, so she dispatched me to check on his progress.”
Trevor nodded slowly, processing this information.
“I understand completely.”
At that precise moment, the phone buried deep in his pocket erupted into a shrill ringtone.
The shrill sound of the ringtone broke the silence in the hallway.
Trevor offered Tina an awkward smile and mouthed a quick apology before slipping into a nearby corner to take the call.
.

###Chapter 1201:
He kept his voice quiet, and no one could make out what he was saying. Tina chose not to follow him. Instead, she drifted aimlessly around the area, lost in her thoughts.
Roughly ten minutes passed before Trevor ended the call. His expression had grown even more tense, and he moved toward her at a brisk pace.
Seeing his anxious face, Tina suddenly felt uneasy.
“Do you have something you want to say to me?”
Trevor hesitated for a moment, his eyes darting around to check the corridor.
He realized this was not a suitable spot for a confidential talk.
With a serious look, he lowered his voice.
“Miss Delgado, we should find somewhere more private to discuss this.”
The comment left Tina slightly startled.
She instantly picked up on the gravity of the situation and gave a quiet nod.
“Alright.”
Without wasting another moment, they headed off together, one after the other.
Neither of them noticed a pair of cold, watchful eyes peering through the crack of the fire escape door.
A faint smile crept onto Lenny’s lips as he melted back into the shadows.
When Tina and Trevor finally reached the underground parking lot, Trevor stopped in his tracks.
The space felt deserted except for a few scattered cars.
He turned to face Tina, his manner more serious than ever. He cleared his throat and said,
“Miss Delgado, I have something important that I must share with you right away.”
A tight feeling gripped Tina’s heart.noveldrama
Considering Trevor served as Blaine’s chief bodyguard, it took something significant to make him act with such seriousness.

Trevor dropped his voice even lower. “A while back, Hailey was taken by some people, and Mr. Castro has been quietly looking into it. You must be aware that before Jack fell into a coma, he clung tightly to a phone that was badly damaged. According to Mr. Castro, there might be something really important hidden on that device. The phone was sent for repairs right away.”
He paused and met Tina’s gaze. “I just got a call from the shop. The phone has been fixed.”
A faint crease formed between Tina’s brows.
She already knew what happened to Hailey.
Looking at Trevor with a questioning look, she asked, “So what happened?”
An even more serious look came over Trevor’s face. “Miss Delgado, doesn’t any of this strike you as strange? Out of nowhere, Mr. Castro suddenly had an ‘allergic reaction’ and ended up fighting for his life. Only a day ago, Stan was injected with some mysterious substance. In a matter of moments, he passed away. Both of these incidents happened close together, and I can’t help but believe someone has targeted Mr. Castro on purpose.”

###Chapter 1202:
Shock jolted through Tina, and her palms grew damp with cold sweat. She had heard about what happened to Stan and assumed it was a terrible accident.
The thought that someone might have also targeted Blaine with a hidden injection suddenly felt much more real.
Images of Lenny’s strange behavior and his rushed exit played over and over in her mind.
With a worried look, Trevor said with genuine urgency, “Now that Mr. Castro is in this state, I have to stay at the hospital. That phone might hold the answers we need. Miss Delgado, would you be able to help retrieve it?”
Tina understood instantly.
This task meant far more than simply picking up a phone.
There could be a dangerous plot unfolding, and Blaine’s life might be hanging in the balance.noveldrama
She gave it only a moment’s thought before agreeing. “No problem. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll take care of it right now.”
A flicker of gratitude crossed Trevor’s eyes. “Miss Delgado, please take care of yourself. Anyone bold enough to go after Mr. Castro won’t hesitate to go further. I’ll send you the address right away.”
Tina nodded, a wave of anger rising within her. “Stay at the hospital and make sure Mr. Castro gets the care he needs. If someone is really behind all this, they have no conscience at all!”
The fact that someone dared to challenge the Castro family and even pull the Wall Group into this mess was outrageous.
Curiosity mixed with her anger as she wondered what kind of people had the nerve to act so recklessly.
Half an hour later, Tina arrived at a quiet, isolated street, guided by the location Trevor provided.
She spotted the repair shop up ahead. It was a small place, and the faded sign above the glass door read “Quick Phone Repair, Data Recovery.”
Most of the businesses nearby looked rundown, which only made the area feel more deserted.
Fresh chapters uploaded on gα?ησvls?c?m
Tina found it hard to believe that any badly damaged phone could be fixed in a shop like this.
She stretched her neck, trying to see inside.
The interior was tight and dim, with no sign of anyone working.
Only a few scattered tools and phone parts covered the counter.
She extended her hand and gave the glass door a gentle tap. “Knock, knock, knock.”
A few seconds went by without any sign of life.
Maybe she had arrived too early. Or perhaps Trevor had sent her the wrong location.
Uncertainty made Tina hesitate, and she considered leaving and returning later.
Right as she turned to go, a rough and impatient male voice called out from inside the shop, “Who’s there?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1203:
Tina swung back around, feeling a bit relieved.
At least someone was present.
She cleared her throat and said, “Hello, I’m here to pick up a phone. The order number is 032.”
The moment those words left Tina’s lips, the sound of footsteps echoed from the staircase at the back of the shop. The steps were slow and unhurried. A man in a faded gray jacket came into view. He looked to be in his middle years.
Messy hair framed his tired face, and dark circles under his eyes hinted at restless nights.
When he looked at Tina, there was nothing readable in his expression.
“Please wait here, Miss. I’ll fetch it for you right away.”
He turned toward the counter and began searching through a shelf thick with dust.
After a minute, he pulled out an old cardboard box.
There was nothing special about it. The box was small and looked quite ordinary.
“It’s inside this box,” he said, handing it over to Tina. “A gentleman has already settled the payment.”
Taking the box, Tina noticed how unexpectedly heavy it felt in her hands.
She glanced down, but the box was completely unmarked.
Could the answers really be hidden inside this plain box?
A wave of doubt and curiosity swirled through her mind.
“Thank you,” she said quietly, before making her way out of the shop.
Bright sunlight outside forced her to narrow her eyes.noveldrama
A black sedan sat silently by the curb, blending into the street.

She reached for the car door, but a deep, steady voice sounded from behind.
“Miss Delgado.”
Startled, Tina spun around quickly.
She found herself looking at Alex.
Why would he show up here?
He wore a dark suit that fit him perfectly, making him look even more polished and striking.
Yet, his eyes held a scrutinizing gaze.
Tina managed to hide her shock and offered a practiced, businesslike smile. “Mr. Howe, what are the odds? I didn’t expect to see you here. Is there something you need?”
Alex’s gaze dropped briefly to the box in her hands.
A subtle smile touched his lips, and he said calmly, “I received a call saying the repair was finished, so I came by to pick it up myself.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1204:
For a moment, Tina just blinked in surprise.
He was also here to collect something? And it had just been repaired?noveldrama
This was too much of a coincidence.
A chill of suspicion began to settle in her chest.
Whenever Alex appeared, he always left her feeling a little on edge.
Almost as if he sensed her uncertainty, Alex kept his gentle smile and continued, “Blaine and I sent that phone in together for repairs,” he said, nodding at the box Tina carried. “Now that you have it, you should take it straight to Blaine. I’m sure he’s waiting for news.”
As soon as she heard Blaine’s name, Tina’s expression softened. Worry replaced her earlier smile.
“Mr. Howe, you might not have heard yet,” she said quietly, lowering her voice. “Mr. Castro… he had an allergic reaction yesterday. He’s still in the ICU and hasn’t pulled through yet.”
Alex’s face registered just the right amount of shock. “What? How could something like that happen?”
His eyebrows drew together, and worry colored his words. “Blaine has always been in good health. How could he develop an allergy all of a sudden?”
He took a step closer. “Miss Delgado, please don’t be overly anxious. I’m certain Blaine will recover soon.”
A look of genuine concern filled his deep eyes, giving his words extra weight.
Yet Tina found it impossible to tell what truly lay beneath his expression. There was something about Alex’s timing that made her uneasy, as if he had planned everything too well.
Tension hung thick in the air between them.
Right at that moment, Tina’s phone buzzed softly from her pocket.
Without thinking, she glanced at the screen and saw the call came from an emergency company number.
Explore new chapters g?lησνs?com
A surge of dread swept through her, and she hurried to answer. “What happened?”
Her colleague on the other end spoke quickly, the urgency clear in his voice. As Tina listened, her face clouded over, and her brows drew tighter together.
Alex remained nearby, wearing the same mild smile.
He drummed his fingers lightly against his pant leg, all while watching Tina with a careful gaze.
Barely five minutes passed before Tina hung up, her complexion suddenly pale and filled with alarm.
She seemed to have made a difficult decision. She raised her eyes and spoke softly, “Mr. Howe…”
Her voice came out raspy, and she held out the box with a trembling hand. “There’s a crisis at the company, and I have to go take care of it right away. Could you please do me a favor and bring this to Ms. Hudson for me?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1205:
Alex’s eyebrows lifted just barely, as if he hadn’t truly expected her request. He paused, letting his eyes move between Tina’s worried face and the box she offered.
“Well… alright.”
A rush of relief swept over Tina, her face openly grateful. “Thank you, Mr. Howe. I really appreciate this!”
With care, she handed him the box, her tone turning serious. “You’ll find Ms. Hudson at the Jazmah Hopevale Hospital or over at Wall Group. I have to leave right now!”
Not wasting another second, she swung open the sedan’s door and climbed inside.
The car’s engine sprang to life, and she drove off, quickly blending into the traffic and vanishing around the corner.
Alex stood in place, watching until her car was out of sight.
Slowly, his gentle smile faded, leaving behind a much colder look.
He glanced down at the battered cardboard box in his grip, his eyes dark and unreadable.
His knuckles whitened as he clenched the box.
Thankfully, his team had been quick to inform him of the situation.
If they hadn’t been so efficient, things might have ended very differently today. Without hesitation, Alex turned and headed for a black Bentley parked nearby, slipping into its dimly lit interior.
He dropped the box onto the passenger seat without a second thought, making no immediate move to start the engine. Instead, he reached inside the box and pulled out the old phone.
A quick press of the power button brought the screen to life, displaying an unread message at the top: “Alex was seen on the evening of the seventh, at 9:15 PM, in Alley Three of the urban village, meeting with a woman believed to be Hailey. Both entered an old apartment building and stayed there for roughly two hours. Surveillance footage shows the two have met before.”
Alex’s eyes darkened as he studied the screen, unreadable.
He fixed his gaze on the message, and a slow, cold smile spread across his lips. After a moment, he tapped the screen gently, switching the phone off.
His attention then shifted to the storage compartment, where he retrieved another phone—one that matched the first in every detail, even the scratches on its surface.
He carefully placed the identical device back into the battered cardboard box. As for the original phone that Blaine had wanted repaired, Alex tossed it carelessly into the storage space.
Blaine and his people truly refused to give up.noveldrama

###Chapter 1206:
If they wanted information so badly… he was ready to hand them exactly what he decided they should see.
After half an hour, Alex smoothly pulled his car into the parking lot of Jazmah Hopevale Hospital. He made his way directly to the ward where Sadie had been staying, without stopping along the way.
To his surprise, the room was completely empty. A slight frown appeared on Alex’s face as he scanned the surroundings. He turned and called out to a nurse who happened to be passing by.noveldrama
“Excuse me, is Ms. Sadie Hudson still in the hospital?”
The nurse looked up, pausing for a moment before responding, “Oh, Ms. Hudson? She was discharged about an hour ago. I heard she went to Faron Retreat.”
A glimmer of interest flickered in Alex’s eyes as he thanked her. Without hesitation, he left the hospital, his curiosity propelling him forward.
Faron Retreat…
What kind of place could that be?
He vaguely remembered that it had been left abandoned for years, with rumors circulating that a devastating fire had ruined everything. Whispers spoke of a tragic event—a man and a woman who had perished in the blaze.
Alex didn’t waste any more time pondering it. He pulled out his phone and quickly searched for directions to Faron Retreat.
Meanwhile, Sadie’s car rolled through the gates of Faron Retreat.
Stepping onto the grounds, which felt both unfamiliar and oddly nostalgic, she was overwhelmed by a surge of mixed emotions. Her parents had stayed at this place for a short while many years ago, but now, nothing looked the same. Only broken walls and remnants remained.
Standing at the entrance, an older man with streaks of gray in his hair noticed the car’s arrival. He quickly made his way over, offering Sadie a polite nod.
“Ms. Hudson, welcome. I manage things here. Our boss has been waiting for you.”
Sadie gave the man a measured look, then nodded in acknowledgment. She said nothing more, stepping inside with Austen right behind her.

As they moved further into the retreat, the damage left by the old fire became harder to ignore.
Buildings that once stood in perfect rows were now nothing but blackened shells, silent and empty in the breeze. Where orchards had once thrived, only dried branches and fallen leaves now littered the ground.
The old man guided Sadie through a messy courtyard, eventually stopping in front of a small building that had survived mostly intact. He opened the battered wooden door, revealing a reception room.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1207:
While the rest of the retreat showed clear signs of neglect, this particular room remained surprisingly clean. Every piece of furniture inside had an unmistakably vintage air, as though nothing had changed here for many long years.
A man sat at ease on a faded sofa, calmly sipping coffee.
Dressed in a sharp designer suit and wearing an expensive watch, he looked out of place in such surroundings, yet his relaxed posture made the contrast feel almost natural.
This was Humphrey Perry, the current owner of the land at Faron Retreat. Sadie had already checked his background—he was far from simple and seemed closely linked to the Perry family in Zupren.
Her gaze cooled as she looked his way, giving him a slight nod.
“Mr. Perry, I hope you haven’t waited too long.”
Humphrey looked up, his eyes flicking to his watch before a smooth, practiced smile formed.
“I just arrived myself.”
He motioned to the sofa across from him.
“Now that you’re here, Ms. Hudson, let’s get right to business.”
He placed his coffee mug on the table and leaned forward, his eyes sharp and focused.
“What makes you so eager to acquire this land, Ms. Hudson?”
A gentle smile touched Sadie’s lips as she met his gaze without flinching.
“Everyone carries a bit of history, don’t they? I was drawn to this land by its natural…”
“Beauty. If it comes down to price, Mr. Perry, just say the word.” No matter what obstacles arose, Sadie had made up her mind to secure this property. There was a fleeting but meaningful tie to her parents here, making it precious in her eyes.
Humphrey gave a knowing laugh. “You and I both know money isn’t an issue for you, Ms. Hudson.”noveldrama
He lifted his mug again and took a thoughtful sip.
1@?€$? ￠#4€?$ 1? gnovels.c?m
“If you’re truly interested in the land, I may consider letting it go.” His voice held a playful note as he paused. “However…”
Sadie sensed he was about to give in, and her attention sharpened.
“If there’s something else you want, Mr. Perry, just tell me. As long as it’s within my reach, I’ll make it happen.”
Humphrey’s smile grew, though something unreadable flickered in his eyes for a moment.
“It’s actually quite straightforward.”
He put down his coffee and tapped his fingers gently on the tabletop.
“Lately, my family is hoping to broaden our reach here at home.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1208:
He watched Sadie carefully, waiting for a reaction.
“Would you be open to helping out, Ms. Hudson? I’m thinking of a spot for next month’s International Business Exchange.”
Sadie hesitated.
She lifted her gaze, surprise flashing in her eyes.
Over the last three years, with Noah away, she had poured her energy into supporting Wall Group. Aiming to boost its reach and raise its profile abroad, she had established the International Business Exchange.
This yearly event not only created countless opportunities for collaboration but also helped Wall Group find trustworthy partners, cementing its spot at the forefront of the industry.
This year would mark the fourth time it was being held.
Right now, Wall Group was busy with planning, and the invitation list was still under careful review.
Sadie never imagined that someone would set their sights on this prized opportunity so quickly. It was clear that Humphrey was not just any businessman. The chance to participate in the International Business Exchange was a valuable gateway for the Perry family.
Even so, a subtle but persistent feeling of unease settled in the back of Sadie’s mind. She took a moment to gather her thoughts, then looked at Humphrey with her usual steady composure.
“You give me too much credit, Mr. Perry. It’s just a small favor. Still, I have to ask, why does Perry Group—so established in the global market—suddenly want to branch out at home?”
Humphrey looked caught off guard for a second. Then he lifted his eyes to meet hers, his smile easy and warm.
“Ms. Hudson, you may not realize it, but Perry Group actually began right here in Jazmah.”
“Many years ago, certain unforeseen events forced the Perry family to uproot and move to Zupren. Now, the elders are getting on in years, and their only wish is to return to their hometown to spend and enjoy their retirement.” Humphrey’s voice was laced with wistful nostalgia as he explained the situation.
Sadie merely listened in silence, her face devoid of emotion. She understood what he was saying, and his side of the story seemed reasonable enough.

“In that case, I see no issue with granting you a spot. I wish the Perry Group well in their return home.”
Humphrey’s smile deepened as he stood up and extended his hand.
“Then, here’s to a fruitful collaboration.”
Sadie rose as well and shook hands with him.
“Likewise.”

###Chapter 1209:
Their handshake was firm and short, and they pulled away almost instantly. Without missing a beat, Humphrey’s chief bodyguard appeared beside him and handed over the land transfer agreements that had been prepared beforehand. Both Sadie and Humphrey took their time reviewing the contracts. Once they had confirmed the details, they affixed their signatures to the documents.
The deal was officially sealed.noveldrama
Humphrey glanced at his watch and said, “I’m afraid I have other matters to attend to, Ms. Hudson. I won’t take up more of your time.”
Sadie gave him a small nod.
“Take care, Mr. Perry.”
Humphrey turned and walked out, his stride steady and sure.
He was about to exit the building when another figure hurried over from the opposite direction. It was Alex.
His eyes immediately found Sadie standing at the door, but he noticed the departing man.
Alex’s brows furrowed as he swept his gaze over Humphrey. He looked familiar somehow, but Alex didn’t have the time to dwell on it. His thoughts were occupied entirely with Sadie, leaving no room for anyone or anything else.
And so, Alex missed the profound hatred that flashed across Humphrey’s eyes as the latter brushed past him.
If Alex had seen it, he would have felt that hostility right to his bones. As it was, Humphrey looked away, schooled his features, and then got into the black sedan parked outside the ruins.
The car door slammed shut, cutting off the outside world.
Humphrey leaned back in the spacious backseat, his fingers flipping through the freshly signed contract.
The driver glanced at him through the rearview mirror. “Mr. Perry,” he called out respectfully. “What do we do next?”
Humphrey’s smile curled into a cold grin. When he looked up, there was a sinister gleam in his eyes.
Lаt?st chαpt?rs in glovls.ｃοm
“Three years ago, my older sister, Aliza, devoted herself to Alex Howe. She gave him all her heart and soul.” His voice was low and chilly. “But that bastard had actually… And all for that damn woman, Sadie Hudson!”
Humphrey inhaled sharply, his fingers clenching around the edge of the pages until his knuckles turned white.
“None of that matters now. They will learn the consequences of their actions soon enough. I will settle the score for the suffering my sister endured, as well as the shame that the Perry family bore—with interest. I will avenge our family, once and for all.”
Humphrey loosened his fingers and tapped on the surface of the paper, his gaze turning pensive.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1210:
A lot of things could change in three years.
In truth, he hadn’t expected Alex and Sadie to have completely forgotten about the Perry family. But perhaps that was for the best. It would certainly make the next phase of his plan easier to set in motion.
However… Why was Sadie even interested in purchasing this remote, barren land? What was her motive?
Humphrey cocked his head to the side, frowning.
“Find out what Sadie plans to do with this land,” he instructed the driver.
“Got it, Mr. Perry.” With that, the driver started the engine, and the black sedan slowly drove away from Faron Retreat.
Meanwhile, Sadie remained at the entrance of the building, watching Alex approach. For some reason, the air around her seemed to have grown thin. She instinctively took a couple of steps back, widening the distance between her and Alex.
This didn’t escape Alex’s notice. He faltered in his steps, a hint of sadness flickering in his eyes.
But it was gone in an instant. He plastered a smile on his face and tried to ease the awkward atmosphere.
“Sadie, I was asked to deliver something to you.” He produced the cardboard box and held it toward her.
Sadie’s brows furrowed as she stared at the box. She hesitated for a few moments before eventually taking it.
It felt slightly heavy in her hands. What could be inside?
Alex caught the confusion on Sadie’s face and said softly, “This is the phone Blaine sent to a shop for repairs not long ago.”
So it was Blaine’s phone. Sadie gave a small nod as understanding dawned.
“Thank you.” Her words were careful, keeping some distance between them.

Alex glanced around, taking in the lonely, eerie feel of the place, curiosity clear in his eyes.
“Sadie, what brings you here?”
This spot was so far from everything, and Alex knew it wasn’t a place Sadie would visit without a reason.
Sadie looked down at the cardboard box in her grip, her voice coming out in a soft rasp. “It’s a long story.” She fell silent for a moment, as if swept up by old memories. “Five years ago, my parents spent some time living here.”
Alex felt a jolt of surprise.
Five years ago? Her parents had stayed here?
All at once, the truth clicked for him. Everything made sense—her reason for being here and her desire for owning this land.

###Chapter 1211:
Watching Sadie’s faintly sad expression, Alex felt sympathy well up inside him, and his tone turned gentle.
“Sadie, please don’t worry. I promise to help you figure out what really happened to your parents. You can count on me.”
Sadie’s head lifted slowly at those words, and for a brief second, her eyes shimmered with tears.
She wiped them away with a calm hand, her voice cool and steady once more.
“Thank you, Alex. It’s getting late. You should head back now.”
Her words left no doubt she was sending him away.
A faint shadow crossed Alex’s smile.
He could see that Sadie still maintained her distance.
Disappointment and bitterness washed over him, though he kept those feelings hidden.
A meaningful look passed between them before he gave a slow nod.
“Alright, take care.”
He paused for a moment, then turned to make his way back to his car.
His figure seemed especially solitary as the sun dipped lower in the sky.
Sadie looked away, her expression cooling once again.
Turning toward the old building, she found it even more unsettling in the dim evening light. The scorched walls stood bare and threatening, carved railings that were once beautiful were now broken and warped, and the scent of smoke lingered everywhere.noveldrama
The bodyguard at her side quickly stepped in, moving debris and broken wood aside to clear a safer path for her to walk. Even so, the entire place looked ready to fall apart at any moment.
Suddenly, a section of the rotting railing on the second floor, weakened by years of neglect, gave way with a loud crack and crashed to the ground. A thunderous bang echoed through the empty structure, sending up thick clouds of dust.
“Careful!” The closest bodyguard reacted without hesitation, stepping in front of Sadie and using his body to shield her.
A cloud of dust rolled her way, and Sadie quickly covered her mouth and nose. She still coughed twice, frowning as she did.
Your next tale lives on g ? lnσ ν ?s, com
“Ms. Hudson, this place is far too risky,” the bodyguard said, steady but clearly worried. “Maybe we should leave for now and only come back once everything has been reinforced or cleared out?”
Sadie lifted her eyes, taking in the ruined scene. Answers she was desperate to know might still be hidden among the ruins. A stretch of silence followed before she gave a single nod.
“Alright. While the repairs are being done, make sure the place is cleaned up completely.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1212:
“Yes, Ms. Hudson.”
She started to walk away but stopped when something odd caught her eye at the edge of her vision.
In one of the building’s corners that remained mostly untouched, a flash of metal shone through the dust and debris.
Curiosity sparked. What could that be?noveldrama
Sadie’s brow creased, and she motioned for the bodyguard to take a look. He moved in quickly, clearing away the mess until a small metal box came into view, half-hidden among the ashes.
The box itself was completely black, fitted with a rusted lock that dangled from its latch.
Sadie dropped into a crouch and tried to pull the lock loose, but it would not budge.
A gentle shake produced a muffled noise from inside, hinting that something was still in there.
“Ms. Hudson, it looks like a miniature safe,” the bodyguard said, peering closely at the lock. “Based on how this lock is built, breaking it open might damage whatever’s inside.”
“Find a locksmith to open it properly. Make sure nothing inside gets damaged,” Sadie replied with a firm nod.
Could this box have belonged to her parents? What secrets might it hold?
Sadie straightened up, her eyes drifting over the battered remains of the building once more. Only charred walls and broken fragments remained, not a trace of family warmth to be found anywhere.
A heavy sigh escaped her as she gathered herself and prepared to go. She took a step, only to wince as her shoe pressed against something hard underfoot.
A frown formed as she shifted her foot and brushed aside a thick layer of dust.
A small, round glimmered faintly in the dim light.
Feel the magic on gα?ησν?s?com
She bent down and swept away the dust, uncovering a single pearl.
It lay in her palm, white and smooth, the luster still bright beneath all the dirt.
Was this pearl left behind from long ago?
Sadie’s fingers traced its cool, shining surface, and something flickered in her gaze.
She slipped the pearl into her bag with care and left the building without looking back.
A black Maybach pulled up in front of Wall Group’s headquarters.
Sadie stepped out, her heels hitting the pavement with sharp purpose. She disappeared into the building, her stride unshaken.
Inside the reception area, a group of young staff huddled behind the desk, whispering and laughing. Some scrolled absently through their phones.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1213:
Then came the crisp rhythm of heels against polished marble.
The laughter died instantly. Phones vanished into drawers and pockets. All heads turned toward the sound. Their eyes widened.
Sadie?
Why was she here?
Ever since her business trip to Beversea, Blaine had been handling operations.
She hadn’t been seen at the office in weeks.
And word around the office was—Noah was back.
Were things about to shift?
Sadie didn’t spare them a glance. Her expression remained unreadable as she moved past them.
She headed straight for the executive elevator—the one reserved for the CEO.
The doors slid open. The executive floor was unusually quiet.
She hadn’t reached the office yet when she heard a furious voice.
Tina. “What are you thinking? Ms. Hudson’s only been away for some days and you’ve already slacked off? Look at this desk! Look at this floor! These documents—are you even aware of the dust buildup?”
Sadie slowed her pace.
At the corner, she turned and saw Tina standing in front of the CEO’s office, arms crossed, her tone fierce. She was scolding several employees, but they didn’t look particularly bothered.
One young man, dressed in trendy office wear, leaned casually against a filing cabinet. A smirk played at the corner of his mouth.
“Miss Delgado, don’t you think you’re putting too much faith in Ms. Hudson?” His tone wasn’t loud, but it dripped with provocation. “Everyone knows Mr. Wall is back.”
As for her? “She’ll probably step down soon. So what’s the point of acting all high and mighty?”
“Exactly!” a female employee chimed in. “We’ve worked nonstop. Don’t we deserve a break?”
Stay connected gα?ησv?s?com
The rest exchanged smug glances, wearing their entitlement like armor.
Tina’s face turned bright red. Her chest rose and fell with fury. “You all—” She didn’t get to finish.
A voice came from behind them, sharp and clear, with a faint trace of icy sarcasm.
“Even if I were to step down…”
The group hadn’t noticed the figure in the doorway. Not until it was too late. The room fell still. Expressions that had once brimmed with arrogance turned to stone.
One by one, they turned. And froze.noveldrama
Sadie stood there, her gaze steady and unreadable—but it held a cold edge sharp enough to cut through every inch of false confidence in the room.
.
.

###Chapter 1214:
“I’m still a major shareholder of Wall Group,” she said, her voice quiet but unyielding.
The color drained from every face.
What little boldness they’d clung to vanished without a trace.
“Sadie!” Tina’s voice rang out, laced with both surprise and relief. She hurried to Sadie’s side, her tone brimming with frustration. “You wouldn’t believe what they’ve been saying. It’s appalling.”
Sadie didn’t respond right away. She let her gaze drift across the room. Not a single person dared to move.
“Everyone is expected to take responsibility for their work,” she said at last. Her voice was low, each word clear and deliberate. “If your current role is too much for you, submit your resignation to HR. Wall Group doesn’t run short on people willing to work.”
No one spoke. No one even breathed.
The defiance the employees had worn so easily just moments ago had crumbled.
And their empty words now felt like a bad joke—one none of them dared to repeat.
None of the employees dared to utter another word of defiance.
Their positions came with generous salaries and the prestige of working on Wall Group’s executive floor.
Losing that? Finding something equal—or even close—would be nearly impossible.
The mere thought of unemployment made their knees weak.
“Ms. Hudson, we were wrong. We’re truly sorry.”noveldrama
“We were out of line—please forgive us.”
“Please, give us another chance!”
Their apologies trembled in the air, voices shaking with panic.

Sadie didn’t even glance at them.
She turned and opened her office door.
Tina shot the group a glare and waved them off.
“Alright, enough. Get back to work. And listen—if I catch any of you slacking off again, it won’t be a warning next time.”
The group bowed repeatedly, murmuring thank-yous as they scattered.
As the door creaked open, a wave of dust hit Sadie in the face. She doubled over, coughing hard.
“Ahem… ahem… ahem…” Her brows drew tightly together.
“Are you okay, Sadie?” Tina rushed over and gently patted her back. She looked around and felt her blood boil again.
The desk hadn’t been wiped. The floor hadn’t been swept. Everything was blanketed in neglect.

###Chapter 1215:
“Unbelievable.” Her voice shook with restraint. “You should wait outside. I’ll get someone to clean this up now.”
“No need.” Sadie straightened, her voice rough from the coughing, but her eyes were clear and sharp.
She wiped the corner of her mouth and walked farther inside.
If even the lower ranks were getting bold, what about the cunning executives?
Blaine’s last intervention had kept some of them in check—but not for long.
Now, Noah had returned. He didn’t remember anything, and his mother’s stance was unclear. Hailey was still out there, ready to cause trouble. The entire company was brimming with quiet tension.
It was time they remembered who truly ran Wall Group.
Sadie’s expression cooled into calm resolve.
“Tina.”
“Yes, Sadie?”
“Set a shareholders’ meeting for two this afternoon.”
Tina’s face turned serious. She gave a quick nod. “Understood. I’ll get on it right away.”
Tina understood what this meant. Sadie was done playing defense. She was about to strike back—formally.
At exactly two o’clock, Sadie pushed open the heavy wooden door of Wall Group’s top-floor conference room.
Light from the hallway framed her silhouette, casting a long shadow across the polished floor. The room was empty.
Rows of high-backed leather chairs sat untouched around the long meeting table, basking in the afternoon sun as if mocking her punctuality.
Sadie remained by the entrance. Her gaze swept across the vacant seats, cool and unreadable.
The silence felt staged—too precise, too deliberate.
Still, she stood there, unmoving.

Knock. Knock. Knock…
The sharp knock shattered the stillness in the conference room.
Tina stepped forward and pulled open the door.
Outside the door stood several men and women dressed in crisp business attire, each wearing a different expression.
They were secretaries and assistants representing Wall Group’s key shareholders.
Some held themselves with quiet arrogance, while others avoided Sadie’s gaze altogether.
At the front stood a man in gold-rimmed glasses—Cedric Miller’s assistant. He offered a polite bow. “Ms. Hudson, our apologies. Mr. Miller has an urgent meeting and won’t be able to attend.”noveldrama
Next came a woman with a poised, professional air—Davis Finch’s secretary. “Mr. Finch isn’t feeling well,” she said. “He’s been taken to the hospital and asked me to inform you personally.”

###Chapter 1216:
Then came a younger man, flustered and breathless, a sheen of sweat on his forehead. “Ms. Hudson, Mr. Ramos is stuck in traffic,” he said quickly. “He’ll be very late and sends his apologies.”
One after another, the excuses came. “Urgent matters.” “Unexpected delays.” All carefully worded. All seemingly reasonable.
But no one in the room was fooled. This was a deliberate move—a coordinated absence orchestrated by the cunning shareholders.
Sadie’s lips lifted into a faint smile, one that held no kindness.
She glanced over the group, her gaze calm and cold.
Just as she thought. They were testing her, trying to remind her of their power. As if she were still the naive girl from three years ago—eager to please, easy to sway. Pathetic!
Sadie said nothing. The silence stretched.
The shareholders’ secretaries and assistants exchanged uneasy glances, each one more guarded than the last. The tension in the air was stifling.
No one dared to lift their gaze. They kept their heads down, avoiding the woman at the head of the table—young, composed, and unmistakably in control. Even the air conditioning seemed to have dropped a dozen degrees.
Tina, standing to the side, was visibly seething.
“These shareholders have some nerve,” she snapped. “Ms. Hudson has been absent for just half a month, and they act like they’re about to launch their own companies.”
The words landed like a blow.
A few assistants flinched. Faces went pale. Still, no one spoke.
Sweat glistened on more than one forehead.
Sadie raised a hand, signaling Tina to stop. Then, without rushing, she rose to her feet.
“You may leave.”

There was no argument. The assistants and secretaries turned and filed out, their steps quick, their relief almost visible.
But before they reached the door, Sadie’s voice rang out again—calm and emotionless.
“Tina, make a list of the names who didn’t show up today. There’s no need to notify them next time.” It wasn’t a threat. It was final.
And just like that, she stepped out of the room. The sound of her heels echoed against the polished floor—measured and resolute. Tina remained behind, a slow smile forming on her lips.
Sadie didn’t need to raise her voice or throw accusations.
One move—and she’d pushed the dead weight to the margins.
Those shareholders had just been cut off from Wall Group.
Outside the conference room, the assistants and secretaries froze in place. They’d heard Sadie. Every word. Panic swept across their faces.
Their feet stayed rooted to the floor, as if the weight of her words had frozen them in place.

###Chapter 1217:
Faces pale, eyes wide, they glanced at one another—uncertain, rattled. Some looked like they wanted to speak, to explain, maybe even to beg.
But Sadie was already gone.
Silence followed in her wake. The assistants and secretaries exchanged uneasy looks, then hurried off with dread in their chests—racing to deliver the news to their superiors.
Back in the CEO’s office, everything had been restored.
The desk was spotless. The windows shone. The air felt crisp and cool.
Tina followed Sadie in, her earlier sense of triumph dimming as unease crept in.
Watching the panic in that meeting room had been satisfying—at first.
But now, the weight of it all settled on her.
She hesitated, then spoke. “Sadie… if those shareholders feel cornered, would they retaliate by dumping their shares?”
It was a fair concern. Those longtime stakeholders had held influence for years. Their shares weren’t small.
Sadie moved behind her desk, her expression composed. She sat down and gave a quiet, steady smile.
“That would only benefit us.” Her eyes caught the light—sharp, focused, unshaken.
She was no longer the inexperienced woman she once had been.
Without hesitation, she gave Tina clear instructions.
“If any of those shareholders decide to sell their shares, we buy them. Immediately. Secure everything that becomes available.” Her voice was calm, but her meaning was absolute.
It was better to eliminate instability swiftly—cleanly.
The best way to protect the company was to keep its ownership in her hands.
Tina understood at once.
This had been Sadie’s plan all along.
g?lnσν?s?com is where magic happens
She wasn’t reacting; she was moving with intention—seizing the moment to take back control of Wall Group entirely.
Tina straightened, her earlier concerns replaced with admiration. “Understood. I’ll get started right away.”
She turned and left, her steps lighter than before.
The door closed quietly behind her.
Sadie walked to the sofa and sat down. From her handbag, she pulled out the small box Alex had handed her.
Her fingers lingered on its edges, tracing the rough cardboard.noveldrama
Why had Alex shown up at the repair shop that day?
The timing still felt too convenient. A flicker of unease stirred in her chest.
She pushed it aside and opened the box.
Inside lay a worn phone—the one Blaine had struggled to repair.
Sadie lifted it out. The cold glass brushed her thumb as she pressed the power button.

###Chapter 1218:
The screen lit up. The interface was familiar.
She opened the messaging app and began scrolling through the inbox.
Then her eyes locked on something.
A draft message. Unsent. Dated the same day Noah had been rescued from the urban village.
Her chest tightened. She held her breath.
With trembling fingers, she opened it.
The words hit her like a blow.
“Boss, the personnel are in place. Once we rescue Ms. Burgess, she’ll be immediately taken to the outskirts and hidden.” Each sentence landed like a blade.
Sadie gripped the phone, her nails digging into her palm.
What had really happened that day?
She didn’t want to believe it.
But she read the message again—slowly this time.
Every word was there. Cold. Clear. Unmistakable.
The phone belonged to Jack.
And the preset recipient for that message… was Noah’s private number.
Sadie shuddered, the chill running down her spine and spreading throughout the rest of her body.
Hailey had been snatched away, Jack was gravely injured in his attempt to protect the phone, and Stan was dead.
Could Noah really be the mastermind behind all this?
No, he couldn’t be. It was absolutely impossible! There was no way Noah could have done any of those things.
Sadie’s thoughts were in turmoil, swirling and colliding with each other. Her emotions were just as torn.
She pressed the lock button on the phone. The screen went dark, the glaring message disappearing in the blink of an eye.
Unforgettable stories on g?lnσν?so
And yet, the words seemed to have seared themselves into her mind.
Just what on earth was going on? Why did Noah save Hailey?noveldrama
All those promises he had given her, all the affection and warmth… Were they nothing but lies? Was it all just part of some elaborate deception? The mere thought of this possibility made Sadie’s heart clench painfully, making it hard to breathe.
She closed her eyes and inhaled slowly, forcing herself to calm down. She took several deep breaths, and when she opened her eyes again, her gaze was much clearer.
It was too early to jump to conclusions. There were far too many questions left unanswered.
Sadie knew she needed to launch another, more thorough investigation.
She picked up her phone and called Tina. It was answered after two rings.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1219:
“Tina,” Sadie rasped. “I need you to find a reliable private investigator for me.
Make sure no one else knows about this besides the two of us.”
There was a pause on Tina’s end—she was clearly taken aback by the order. Why would Sadie suddenly need a private investigator? And why would she keep it a secret from everyone?
Although confused, Tina agreed without asking any questions. Sadie must have her reasons for doing this.
“Got it. I’ll take care of it right away.”
In a private room of Nirvana, a group of people sat at a round table, all of them dressed in suits, each wearing a different expression from the last. These were the shareholders who had received the notice for Wall Group’s shareholders’ meeting but had chosen not to attend.
At the head of the table, Malcolm drummed his fingers against the table, his face inscrutable.
Soon enough, the door of the private room opened, and the young assistants and secretaries filed in. They looked to be in various stages of panic.
“Mr. Pierce, the respected directors.” One of the assistants greeted them in a trembling voice. He went on to recount everything that had happened in the meeting room.
When he was done, a pregnant silence filled the room. It lasted for a moment before all hell broke loose.noveldrama
“What the hell is Sadie trying to do now?”
“Does she really think she’s still the same influential chairwoman from three years ago?”
“What gave her the right to hold the shareholders’ meeting?”
Despite their outrage, the shareholders themselves were quite agitated. They were well aware of Sadie’s decisive streak. That woman was capable of outrageous things none of them could even imagine!
They should know—they had experienced the full force of her wrath first-hand, three years ago.
When all was said and done, Sadie was not someone they could afford to provoke.
Don’t miss it: g?lиov.cоm
Now, they were terrified that she might really remove them from the company’s shareholders list.
Just then, an elderly gentleman with graying hair rose to his feet. He swept a gaze over his colleagues and nervously spoke up.
“Gentlemen! Perhaps we should go back? Ms. Hudson… Sadie has been working diligently these past few years, and Wall Group is all the better for her efforts. She has never treated us poorly, either.”
The commotion quieted down, and a few of the shareholders had the grace to lower their gaze in shame. Clearly, they were thinking the same thing. Sadie was indeed ruthless with her methods, but she was highly capable, and she had proven this time and time again.
In fact, the Wall Group had thrived and kept its rising momentum under her leadership.
All of a sudden, Malcolm let out a bark of cold laughter. He picked up his cup and took a leisurely sip.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1220:
“You may be underestimating us, as well as yourself, Mr. Miller.”
All heads turned in Malcolm’s direction.
He set his cup down, his gaze sharpening as he addressed the room.
“If we join forces, then the overall shares we hold would be significant. Sadie can be as audacious as she wants, but she would never dare to remove us all from the company!”noveldrama
His voice rang out with confidence.
True enough, if they were all removed from the board, that would render Wall Group an empty shell.
When that happened, the company’s stock price would plummet, and the first to suffer would be none other than Sadie herself.
“We can pool our shares together, which would amount to a total of ten percent. If we sold them all to outsiders, do you think Sadie could handle the repercussions?”
Malcolm’s face twisted in disdain.
“That insolent woman is just trying to intimidate us.”
He surveyed the room again, taking in the reaction of his peers to his words.
“If any of you wish to return and continue siding with Sadie, I will not stand in your way.”
The instant Malcolm’s words landed, the air shifted. Chatter faded. Those once fidgeting in their seats now stared blankly at the polished table, lips sealed.
Return to the company? For what purpose? Were they really going to entertain juvenile antics orchestrated by a woman half their age, just as Malcolm had said?
They were unwilling.
But suppose they never returned—what if Sadie truly lost control?
An uneasy hush blanketed the space.
Each person mulled over possible gains and setbacks in silence.
Every journey starts at gα?ησν?s?c?
Malcolm scanned their expressions, a knowing grin lifting the edge of his lips.
He picked up his coffee mug, took another sip, and continued leisurely, “Everyone, there’s another issue I’m certain you’ve caught wind of.” His tone dipped, laced with suspense.
“Blaine—the reckless heir of the Castro family—met with a serious mishap not long ago. Last I heard, he’s still unconscious in intensive care.” The tension, already thick, became stifling.
Blaine?
He’d always been Sadie’s most dependable supporter in the company. Ralph, though revered, was far past his prime. The Castro family’s future largely leaned on Blaine’s shoulders.
If he were truly incapacitated, Sadie would be isolated—vulnerable.
To this gathering, it was a fortunate twist.
Wordless exchanges passed between the shareholders, eyes full of calculation. Malcolm took in all their reactions, the corners of his mouth curving ever so slightly.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1221:
He raised his voice with sharpened clarity, each syllable cutting into the room like a blade.
“Sadie stands alone now. The timing couldn’t be better. Miss this window, and we may never get another.”
A ripple of excitement stirred beneath the shareholders’ composed facades.
Truly, regardless of how competent she was, Sadie remained a lone woman.
Without the Castro family’s clout behind her, what influence did she still hold?
Sensing the shift, Malcolm projected his voice with stern resolve. “We’re veterans of the corporate arena. Are we to keep bending to a girl’s command? How will we maintain dignity if this farce continues?”
His words struck a nerve—many of the older members clenched their jaws.
Each had once been a force in their own right.
Yet here they were, dancing to the whims of someone young enough to be their daughter. It was an indignity they’d swallowed for too long.
Then, without warning, Malcolm slammed his palm on the polished wood table. The impact echoed through the chamber like a drumbeat of war.
“She’s crossed a line by threatening us. We’re not spineless. Let’s make her regret underestimating us!”
His steely eyes swept the room. “Let me be clear—I’m offloading every share I own in Wall Group.”
The statement sent shockwaves across the room.
Even his assistant, standing quietly nearby, turned pale with disbelief.
Malcolm jerked his head toward the assistant, eyes gleaming.
“Why are you still standing there? Get it done immediately!”
The assistant was jolted by the command, his lips quivering. He didn’t dare raise a question.
Malcolm wasn’t bluffing—he had made up his mind.
L?tｅst ch?pt?rs in glnovels.ο
To sell all his stock? It was a daring move.
Yet disobedience was not an option.
The assistant lowered his gaze, masking the panic in his expression. He paused only a moment, then bowed and responded, “Right away, Mr. Pierce.” He hurried from the room, shoes clicking briskly against the floor.
The remaining board members observed Malcolm’s conviction, and with it, their lingering doubts vanished.
For the past three years, Sadie had used her position as chairwoman to openly and covertly suppress these veteran shareholders.
Resentment had simmered beneath their polished exteriors for far too long.
Now, with Malcolm boldly leading the revolt, hesitation melted away.
This just might be the ideal moment to bring Sadie down.
Naturally, they weren’t naive enough to offload their entire holdings.noveldrama
Who in their right mind would surrender such a lucrative position in the Wall Group?
.
.
.
###Chapter 1222:
It had all been theatrics.
If they moved in sync, feigned a mass exit, and allowed the rumors to circulate, that overconfident little girl would be swimming in anxiety and pacing through endless nights.
That alone would suffice.
What came next? Still a mystery, still fluid.
First, cause disruption. Shake the ground beneath Sadie’s feet. Then step back, observe, and strike when the time felt right. There was always a way out—always.
“Malcolm’s got the right idea!”
Cedric, whose silver strands betrayed his age, leapt to his feet, his hesitation vanishing.
He clapped his thigh, a flicker of daring flashing across his features.
“I’m on board! Hell, I’ve tolerated enough from that brat.”
With one voice of support, the room lit up like dry leaves catching fire.
“Count me in! Let’s put her in her place.”noveldrama
“No doubt! She’s ruled over us long enough!”
“Sell our shares! Today we remind her—we’re not relics to be pushed aside!”
Instantly, the energy shifted—determined, fiery, charged.
Malcolm observed, his lips curving slowly into a smug grin.
Sadie, she was still too green to challenge him!
Grievances long buried were now pouring out, accusations and complaints hurled at the absent Sadie, thick with resentment.
Then, like a tide receding, the angered group broke into clusters and exited the room—each lost in their own plans.
The boisterous Room 88 fell into silence once more.
Malcolm remained at the table, sipping from his cup—lukewarm and bitter.
He waited. Moments ticked by.
New updates in gα?ησνs?c?m
When he was sure not a soul lingered, he reached into his tailored blazer and withdrew a secure, black device.
With practiced ease, he punched in a memorized string of digits.
The call was picked up without delay.
“Mr. Howe.” Malcolm’s voice, originally somewhat hoarse, now carried a subtle hint of flattery and respect. “Everything’s going just as you laid out. The shareholders are on board. Prepare yourself—the stage is set.”
Alex hung up the phone, his lips curling into a cold, triumphant smile.
Those shareholders were all fools.
But this worked to his advantage. It gave him a strategic edge.
It wouldn’t be long before the shares of Wall Group became his.
Just then, a knock came at the glass door of the living room.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1223:
“Come in.”
Egan entered cautiously, ushering someone inside.
The second person kept their head down, effectively hiding their face, but there was no mistaking their frailty.
Egan gave a respectful bow. “Mr. Howe, this is the new assistant you asked me to find some time ago.”
The so-called assistant immediately stepped forward and bowed deeply in front of Alex. “Hello, Mr. Howe. My name is Beal Martin.”noveldrama
Alex glanced at him without saying anything before casting his questioning eyes at Egan.
That single, silent look spoke volumes.
Egan immediately understood. “Rest assured. Beal is a distant relative of Mrs. Howe. He comes from a long line of honest, reliable people who are discreet and quick on their toes.”
Alex raised an eyebrow at that.
His mother’s distant relative? How interesting.
Nodding lightly to signal his approval, he stood from his imposing chair and walked over.
“Beal, right? I have something for you to do. I need you to go to Howe Group’s branch office and acquire all the Wall Group shares that have been released on the market. Get as many as you can. Make sure you have them secured within the day.”
Beal kept his head down, even as he replied, “Consider it done, Mr. Howe.” After bowing one last time, he took his leave.
Alex watched him go in thoughtful silence.
Once the door clicked shut behind Beal, he turned to Egan and asked, “What’s happening with Sadie lately?”
The moment Egan heard mention of Sadie, his expression became doubly apprehensive.
His brows knitted in confusion. “According to our men, Ms. Hudson is planning to open a clinic tomorrow, apparently for someone named Stuart Lawson. They are preparing for it as we speak.”
Ltτ ?hρτ?rs ιn glov?l.оm
Stuart? Alex frowned. He vaguely remembered the name.
But why would Sadie suddenly decide to open a clinic for that man? Was there something he was unaware of?
For a long while, he paced back and forth across the living room, fidgeting with his hands.
Then he stopped short and raised his head. “We’ll head over there tomorrow.”
Egan had no idea what his boss was planning, but he bowed and said, “Understood, Mr. Howe.”
He knew better than to ask about Alex’s intentions; it wasn’t his place as a mere butler.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1224:
Egan left quietly, closing the door softly behind him.
Unbeknownst to Alex, someone lingered in the shadowy corner of the hallway leading from the guest room to the living room.
Hailey stood in the dark, watching with eyes filled with malice. She had overheard everything.
Stuart? The man who had escaped during the chaos that erupted in the urban village?
Wasn’t he supposed to be hiding like a rat in some dank sewer, barely surviving?
Had Sadie caught him and somehow subdued him?
Had he revealed anything about Hurst?
No, that was impossible. Stuart had nearly killed Noah.
There was no way Sadie would have let him off so easily.
So for her to go through the trouble of setting up a clinic for him… It made no sense.
Hailey’s eyes flickered as another thought crossed her mind.
Without making a sound, she turned away and padded back to the guest room. As she approached the room, the bodyguards stationed at the door scowled at her.
“What took you so long in the bathroom?”
Hailey’s head snapped downward as she clutched her lower abdomen, her face contorting into a mask of manufactured pain. “Sir, I suddenly felt unwell, which delayed me for a moment.”
The bodyguard examined her through narrowed, suspicious eyes before waving her away with visible impatience. “Fine, fine. Go inside and feed the baby. Salex has been wailing for ages now, creating quite the disturbance.”
Relief washed over Hailey as she nodded with practiced obedience.noveldrama
She entered the room with her head lowered, striding quickly toward the cradle. Inside, the newborn lay red-faced and screaming, his piercing cries echoing through the room.
Intense irritation crashed through her chest like a tidal wave.
She thought bitterly about how this little pest could produce such endless noise. He was just like his late father, Sutton—equally maddening in every way. Yet now Alex, that naive fool, along with everyone else, believed Noah was his father.
New updates uploaded to g?lnσνs?c?m
That delusion served her purposes perfectly.
Nothing else mattered beyond that crucial misconception.
Despite her rage burning so fiercely that she longed to hurl the screaming infant away, Hailey’s face transformed instantly into a mask of gentle, loving devotion.
She lifted the baby with calculated care, patting his back while cooing in a voice dripping with artificial sweetness, “There, there, Salex. Be good now. Don’t cry. Mommy’s here. Mommy’s got you.”
This child represented her sole path to revenge and her most valuable piece in the dangerous game ahead.
Regardless of her true feelings, she needed to embody the perfect mother.

###Chapter 1225:
The performance demanded absolute perfection.
On the following day, in the heart of the city, the polished sign for Lawson’s clinic caught the morning sunlight from its perch on the second floor of an impressive office building.
Today marked the clinic’s grand opening.
Sadie had orchestrated a comprehensive publicity campaign in advance.
The clinic welcomed visitors without restrictive entry requirements.
As word spread throughout the city, both prominent figures and curious residents converged on the event.
The atmosphere buzzed with anticipation and energy.
Within the quiet sanctuary of the office, shielded from the noise outside, Sadie observed silently as her skilled makeup team transformed Hurst with meticulous precision.
The figure reflected in the mirror, following the thorough makeover, wore an impeccably tailored charcoal suit.
The transformation was remarkable—the elegant attire masked his typically brooding presence, lending him the distinguished appearance of a seasoned medical professional.
Sadie studied him for several heartbeats, her expression betraying nothing. She harbored no affection for Hurst—without Noah’s situation forcing her hand, she would never have aligned herself with such a man.
Yet circumstances demanded his cooperation.
The lead makeup artist set down his brushes, turned to face her, and spoke with professional courtesy. “Ms. Hudson, we’ve finished.”
Sadie acknowledged him with a subtle nod, her face remaining impassive as she gestured dismissively.
The makeup artists, visibly relieved by her approval, bowed respectfully before making their swift exit.
Only after their departure did Sadie approach.
She examined the unfamiliar “Dr. Stuart Lawson” in the mirror, her voice maintaining its characteristic calm composure. “Once we succeed, this clinic and every piece of equipment within it will belong to you.”

Hurst pivoted toward her, a subtle smile tugging at the edges of his lips. His gaze swept across the opulently decorated office with casual interest, satisfaction gleaming briefly in his eyes.
The clinic’s impressive scope and sophisticated setup surpassed anything he had anticipated.
He acknowledged that Sadie possessed a shrewd form of generosity.noveldrama
“How generous of you, Ms. Hudson.” His voice carried a languid quality, tinged with practiced indifference.
“However, Ms. Hudson, are all security precautions in place today? What happens if the real Stuart storms in and attacks me, the imposter? Mr. Wall could…”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1226:
Sadie’s glacial stare silenced him mid-sentence.
Sadie refused to tolerate anyone weaponizing Noah’s well-being as a bargaining tool, particularly from someone as contemptible as Hurst.
Reading the frost in her gaze, Hurst wisely clamped his mouth shut.
He sneered inwardly while preserving his casual facade.
He had simply wanted to rattle her, to witness her defensive response.
Sadie forced down her rising anger. “I’ve stationed security personnel within a fifty-meter radius of the clinic. The moment Stuart shows himself, we’ll capture him instantly. Provided you conduct yourself properly, remain in position, and avoid any reckless actions, I guarantee your protection.”
She expected Stuart to appear, praying he would stumble directly into her carefully laid snare, enabling her to eliminate this danger permanently. Simultaneously, anxiety gnawed at her that any unforeseen complication might derail today’s scheme and jeopardize Noah’s medical care.noveldrama
Hurst responded to her explanation with an indifferent nod.
He understood instinctively that Sadie would never enter a situation unprepared—he had simply been testing her limits.
This woman possessed the courage to attempt anything where Noah was concerned.
Sadie glanced at her watch face. “The moment has arrived. We need to make our entrance.”
Hurst straightened his suit collar before trailing behind her.
When the office door swung open, the vibrant energy from outside flooded inward.
The expansive, well-lit hall teemed with elegantly dressed attendees, each making their finest impression.
Every pair of eyes in the room shifted toward their entrance.
“Ms. Hudson, congratulations! This must be the celebrated Dr. Lawson, correct? What an honor to meet him face-to-face today.”
A well-dressed man approached the group, his lips stretched into a broad smile. He wasted no time spewing out a slew of his own praises. “If Ms. Hudson holds you in high esteem, then you must have extraordinary skills! Like a multi-awarded, world-renowned doctor, for example!”
Don’t miss fresh updates on gα?ησνs?c?m
Hurst was playing his role convincingly, exuding the demeanor of a refined and slightly reserved medical expert.
His smile was the perfect mix of courteous and confident as he nodded at the compliments thrown his way.
All in all, his demeanor left no room for criticism.
Sadie swept a subtle gaze across the crowd.
Standing not too far away, Tina gave her a small nod—a signal that everything was in place.
Sadie felt a bit more at ease then, but the tension in her body still remained. She scanned the surroundings with vigilant eyes, her heart skipping a beat at each unfamiliar face.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1227:
She could feel a thin sheen of sweat on her palms, her fingers curling instinctively into fists.
She had planned meticulously for today’s event. If Stuart acted as she expected and showed up to cause trouble out of sheer jealousy, then the plan would proceed smoothly.
But if he didn’t appear, she would have to rely entirely on Hurst from now on. When it came down to that, Sadie was determined to force him to save Noah, even if she had to hold him at knifepoint throughout. But of course, it would be best if things didn’t come to that.
That scenario was far too risky and unpredictable.
As Sadie reflected on the possibilities, a group of ladies in elegant attire had flocked to Hurst, holding glasses of champagne as they chattered on merrily.
“Dr. Lawson, I’ve heard so much about you. I have this persistent migraine that has been troubling me for years. I’ve tried all kinds of medicine out there, but none of them worked. I consider it my good fortune to meet you today. You must help me with my terrible predicament.”
Hurst flashed the lady a professional smile, and without missing a beat, said,
“You’re too kind, madam. I would be happy to help. Please, follow me this way.” He gracefully held out his arm to gesture toward a makeshift consultation room.
More people crowded around him then, and they headed over there in unison.
Sadie trailed behind them, her eyes still searching the entire floor.
At long last, a particular figure caught her attention.
This person wore a dark baseball cap that was pulled low over his face. His casual, almost rugged attire was a stark contrast to the party ensembles that the guests were wearing.
The figure was heading toward Hurst, weaving through the crowd with a slow but steady gait.
It was him!
Sadie’s breath caught in her throat. It really was him—she recognized him in an instant.
She was about to meet him halfway when she felt a gentle tap on her shoulder. She flinched and whipped around in surprise.
Discover fresh tales on gα?ησν?sо
She was greeted by Alex’s gentle, smiling face.
“Sadie.”
Sadie took a couple of deep breaths to calm her racing heart, then she forced a stiff smile. “Hello, Alex. What brings you here?”
It was a simple enough greeting, but the underlying tension in her voice was hard to miss.
She really couldn’t be bothered to deal with anyone else now.
Then, before Sadie or Alex could say anything else, chaos broke out.noveldrama
Like a phantom emerging in the middle of the crowd, the man in the baseball cap drew a dagger from his sleeve, aiming the blade directly at Hurst.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1228:
“Die, Stuart!” The man’s hoarse voice rang out across the hall, filled with deep-seated hatred and obvious madness.
The cold gleam of the blade petrified everyone for two whole seconds, then all at once, they were screaming and crying out in alarm. Pandemonium descended as the guests scattered in a panic.
Sadie gritted her teeth. The danger was all too real.
Unfortunately, the security personnel she had arranged for were now struggling to break through the wave of fleeing people. They wouldn’t be able to reach Hurst in time.
The assailant brought the dagger down, the blade slicing through the air in a perfect arc.
In that critical moment, Sadie’s thoughts scattered like startled birds, yet her body moved with primal certainty.
She clenched her teeth and threw herself at Hurst without thinking.
The cold blade swept toward them, growing larger in her vision.
Without hesitation, she grabbed the sharp dagger with her bare hand.
Pain sliced through her palm like lightning, and blood began to flow freely. The dagger’s tip froze just inches from Hurst’s heart.
If Sadie had been even a second slower, the outcome would have been catastrophic.noveldrama
Cold sweat beaded on Sadie’s forehead as her heart hammered wildly, panic flooding through her.
She could feel her hand trembling around the blade, slick with her own blood.
Alex stared at the bloody scene in shock, his face going pale.
He rushed forward immediately, pulling a clean handkerchief from his pocket to press against her wound. “Sadie!” Worry strained his voice.
Finally, the bodyguards snapped into action, cutting through the crowd with swift efficiency.
They tackled the attacker in seconds, pinning him flat against the floor until he couldn’t move.
One bodyguard yanked off the man’s cap, exposing a face twisted with fury.
It was exactly Stuart!
Sadie’s rigid muscles finally loosened, and she let out a shaky breath of relief.
Her palm still throbbed with pain, but satisfaction warmed her chest.
Today’s desperate efforts had finally paid off. She’d actually pulled it off.
From where he stood, Hurst cast a meaningful glance at Sadie, who had risked her own safety to shield him from harm.
Never in his life had someone acted so selflessly to save him.
Though he understood this woman had her own motives for doing so, an indescribable feeling sparked in his heart before vanishing quickly, as if it had never existed.
Clearing his throat softly, as if trying to rid it of something unwelcome, he turned his attention to Stuart, who was still writhing on the floor. A slow smirk of satisfaction spread across Hurst’s face as he watched the pathetic scene unfold.

###Chapter 1229:
“Stuart,” he said quietly, yet his voice carried with crystal clarity to everyone present. “Surprised? Even someone like you would end up like this.”
Trapped beneath the bodyguards’ iron grip, Stuart was completely helpless.
The moment he heard those words, his eyes bulged with rage, and he thrashed like a wild animal.
“Hurst! You piece of trash! What gives you the right to be so smug? I’m Stuart! The real Stuart! What are you? Nothing but a worthless dog I raised! A shadow, a damn impostor who can never replace me!” His words were as vicious as they were vile.
Sadie’s face darkened with disgust, her contempt obvious to anyone watching. She shot a withering look at Stuart, who was still ranting pathetically on the floor, then nodded curtly to the bodyguards nearby.
“Get him out of here. Don’t let him continue this disgusting spectacle in public.”
The bodyguards immediately hauled the still-cursing Stuart away without ceremony.
Meanwhile, Alex watched blood continue streaming from Sadie’s palm, his worry mounting by the second.
“Sadie, this wound is serious. We need to get you to a hospital immediately!” he urged, trying to guide her toward the exit.
But Sadie pulled away from his grasp with quiet determination.noveldrama
“I’m fine.”
Though her hand throbbed relentlessly, the physical pain barely registered against the crushing weight of her anxiety.
Noah’s deteriorating condition consumed her thoughts completely.
Turning to face Hurst, who stood watching her with an unreadable expression, she spoke with quiet intensity.
“I’ve kept my end of the bargain. When does Noah’s treatment start?”
Hurst’s gaze dropped to her hand, where blood continued to flow freely, and his expression tightened with concern.
“I don’t collaborate with those who are incapacitated,” he said bluntly, as though stating an obvious truth. “If that wound keeps bleeding at this rate, you might be looking at amputation.”

The word hit Sadie like a physical blow. Amputation?
Her heart lurched painfully in her chest.
When she looked down at her palm, the reality struck her fully. The gash was devastatingly deep, white bone visible through the torn flesh, and blood had completely saturated Alex’s handkerchief with no signs of slowing.
If this injury delayed Noah’s treatment or left her unable to function properly, it would be a grave mistake.
“Alright,” she said through clenched teeth, pain and determination warring in her voice. “Just remember what you promised me.”
After saying that, Sadie turned to leave and get her injury treated.

###Chapter 1230:
“You can leave him to me,” Hurst said coldly from behind her. “I’ll deal with him.” His eyes were on Stuart, who kept cursing and struggling against the bodyguards despite the obvious gap in strength.
Sadie paused in her steps but didn’t bother to look back. “Do as you please.” After all, Stuart’s fate was of no concern to her.
Stuart was a ruthless megalomaniac who was hell-bent on harming Noah, and today, he committed violence in broad daylight. He was a lunatic.
Keeping him alive would only make him an even more dangerous threat in the future.
As far as Sadie was concerned, it was better to leave him in Hurst’s hands. Hurst harbored a deep-seated hatred for Stuart and would surely give the man the suffering he deserved.
Alex glanced at the disheveled Stuart on the floor, then at the stern-faced Hurst. His eyes flickered with some unnamed emotion, but he refrained from saying anything. “Let me take you to the hospital,” he said to Sadie as he jogged to catch up with her.
Sadie looked down at her bleeding hand and realized she might not even be able to grip the steering wheel.
And Tina was still dealing with the incident’s aftermath. Between their men awaiting further orders and the terrified guests, Tina had her hands full.
Sadie gave Alex a short nod and said in a hoarse voice, “Thank you.”
Half an hour later, they were in a hospital downtown. Sadie’s wound was cleaned, stitched up, and wrapped in thick bandages.
“You are quite lucky,” the doctor remarked as he gathered his tools. “The blade missed the major tendons and nerves. Make sure your wound doesn’t get wet and you take your medication on time. You may come back in a week for a follow-up examination.”
Sadie murmured a soft “Thanks.” The pain in her palm had indeed eased, if only a little.
She gingerly exited the examination room.
Alex had been waiting outside, and he approached when he saw her coming out the door.

He took off his suit jacket and draped it over Sadie’s shoulders. “The hospital’s air conditioning is a bit cold. Wear this so you don’t catch a chill.”
Sadie was only wearing an evening dress, the fabric of which was quite thin. Alex’s jacket was still warm from his body, and while it did bring her some comfort, it also gave her an inexplicable sense of unease.
She shifted slightly, her face stiff.
This did not escape Alex’s notice at all. His earnest gaze dimmed slightly, but he quickly recovered.
“Did you organize today’s event just to lure Stuart out?” he asked casually to break the awkward silence.
In truth, Alex had been suspicious from the start. He knew Sadie’s style—she wasn’t the type to get involved in high-profile situations without a specific purpose.noveldrama
Sadie nodded in response.

###Chapter 1231:
Noah was in dire condition, and her only hope was Hurst.
Her scheme had been more of a gamble than a collaboration.
She looked up at Alex, her face etched with fatigue. “Thank you for today, Alex,” she said politely. “I’ll treat you to a meal one of these days.”
Alex was about to say that there was no need, that she didn’t have to be so formal with him, but Sadie was already looking at her watch.
“I should go check on Noah.” Then she brushed past him and headed for the elevator without even waiting for him to respond.
The clicking sound of her heels against the tiled floor sounded unusually loud in the corridor.
Alex had instinctively reached for her, but his hand was left frozen in mid-air. He was rooted to the spot, watching Sadie’s slender figure walk away from him with firm, resolute strides, until she disappeared behind the elevator doors.
Alex felt a weight settle in the pit of his stomach the moment the elevator doors closed, as if they were permanently severing his ties with Sadie. His hand slowly clenched into a tight fist. Why did Sadie care about Noah that much?
If she wanted to save Noah that badly, then he would gladly see to it that the bastard survived.
He would personally make sure that Noah was awake and aware as he gradually lost everything. That kind of slow and helpless agony would certainly be a fate worse than death!
Yes, perhaps letting Noah live would be better, after all.
Alex was pulled out of his thoughts when his phone vibrated inside his pocket. Beal’s name flashed on the screen.
Alex’s face darkened as he answered the call. “Yes?” he snapped, his voice strained.
“Mr. Howe,” Beal said, respectful as ever, “I’ve made all the necessary arrangements here at the branch office. Our people are on standby, ready to acquire any of the Wall Group’s shares as soon as they are on the market.”
Some of the tension left Alex’s body, but his demeanor remained chilly. “Well done. Go over to the headquarters and take over all the work Stan previously handled.”
Stan had proven himself to be rather incompetent; it was time to have someone more obedient beside him.
Updates loaded at g@lnoνes?com
Beal didn’t have to be told twice. “Understood, Mr. Howe.”
The call ended.
Tucked away in a quiet corner of a downtown café, Beal set his phone aside and looked respectfully at the man across the table, who stirred his coffee with slow, deliberate motions.
“Everything’s gone exactly as you wanted, Mr. Perry. Alex has walked into our trap.”
At that, a faint, icy smile flickered across Humphrey’s lips, though his eyes stayed as cold and unreadable as ever. His spoon stilled in the cup for just a heartbeat.
Alex believed he was running the show, never suspecting the real game was happening behind the scenes.noveldrama
Humphrey’s nod was barely perceptible. “Stay in character and keep a close eye on him. The moment anything happens, you contact me.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1232:
Beal bowed his head in acknowledgment. “Understood, Mr. Perry.”
Setting down his cup, Humphrey let it make a quiet clink against the saucer. Without another word, he rose from his seat and exited the café, leaving Beal behind.
Meanwhile, Sadie had reached the VIP hospital suite where Noah was recovering.
Sadie eased the door open, careful not to disturb the peaceful atmosphere inside.
Golden sunlight filtered through the blinds, painting shifting patterns across the quiet room.
Noah was wearing a loose hospital shirt. He looked frail as he leaned against the window, letting the afternoon sun wash over him. The angle of the light made his features look even more delicate.
The gentle click of the door caught his attention, and he turned his head slowly. Spotting Sadie, he managed a faint smile, but his gaze lingered on her shoulders, something flickering in his expression.
Just as quickly, the smile faded and uncertainty crept into his eyes.
Was that Alex’s jacket draped over Sadie?
Why would she be wearing his coat?
His eyes drifted downward, almost by accident, and settled on her left hand, bundled tightly in heavy bandages.
The sight of the bandages made his eyes widen in alarm.
He immediately tried to push himself up from the chair, panic clear in his voice. “Sadie, what happened to your hand? How did you get injured? Is it bad?”
Seeing how shaken he was, Sadie felt a wave of warmth and quickly moved closer, pressing gently on his shoulder to keep him from getting up.
She tried to reassure him with a soft, easy smile. “It’s nothing, just a scratch.”
Noah’s eyes were fixed on her hand, worry etched in every line of his face.
To ease his mind, Sadie lifted her bandaged hand and waved it playfully, hoping to downplay her injury. “It’s honestly nothing serious. The doctor checked it out and said no bones were broken. I’ll be fine in a couple of days.”
L?tst chαpt?rs in glnovels.cm
Noah gently reached out, his fingers brushing over the cool bandages wrapped around her hand. Only then did some of the tension in his posture ease, though the concern in his eyes lingered.
Guilt gnawed at him. If it hadn’t been for him, Sadie never would have ended up in harm’s way.
Picking up on his thoughts, Sadie offered a soft reassurance. “I’ve already sorted things out with Hurst. This time, he won’t dare play any tricks.” Her voice left no room for doubt.
Noah reacted immediately, using his free hand, not connected to an IV, to pull her in. He pressed her firmly against his chest, holding her close.
He lowered his chin until it rested on top of her head, and when he finally spoke, his words were rough but full of affection. “You’ve gone through so much lately, Sadie.”
She melted into his embrace, letting the warmth of his arms and the steady beat of his heart wash away the exhaustion she’d been carrying. For the first time in days, she truly felt safe.

###Chapter 1233:
But then another worry pricked at her.
Jack’s phone.
That message he never sent!
Each word replayed in her mind, sharp and painful.
Sadie hesitated, her voice quiet but probing. “Noah, is there something you haven’t told me?”
Noah’s embrace stiffened for a heartbeat.
He loosened his hold, studying her face with a puzzled frown. “What’s going on?”
“Sadie? Why would you suddenly ask something like that?”
Sadie searched his expression, looking for any hint of deception.
All she saw in his eyes was genuine confusion. Nothing about it seemed fake.
A shadow flickered in her eyes.
Was it possible she’d misunderstood everything?
She gave a small shake of her head, pushing down the tangle of feelings, and managed a faint, reassuring smile. “It’s nothing. Really.”
Noah went still, picking up on the unspoken tension in her eyes.
Still, he decided not to press.
What mattered most was that Sadie was here with him now, and nothing else seemed as important.
He gathered her in his arms again, holding her like something precious he’d almost lost.
Yet Sadie’s mind refused to settle.
That message from Jack’s phone gnawed at her thoughts.
She needed to know the truth, no matter what it took.
If Noah was innocent, then could it be that someone had tampered with the phone?

A rough cough broke the quiet from the doorway. “Ahem. Ahem.” Both Sadie and Noah reacted at once, turning toward the sound.
At the threshold, Tina hesitated, nerves etched across her face, while Hurst loomed silently behind her.
Dressed in his trademark dark suit, Hurst looked nothing like the polished professional he was in the clinic. Tina walked further into the room, cheeks tinged with embarrassment. “Sadie, I’m sorry for interrupting you.”
Fingers nervously twisting together, she looked anxiously at Hurst.
“There’s… well, Mr. Lawson wanted—”
A word was unnecessary. Hurst’s presence filled the room, his silence heavier than any greeting.
Nobody could overlook him, no matter how hard they tried.
Sadie gently patted Noah’s arm, encouraging him to stay composed.
Carefully, she helped Noah ease back against the pillows, making sure he was settled.noveldrama
.

.
###Chapter 1234:
“It’s all right,” she said calmly, her tone cool and collected.
Noah still looked too fragile to handle visitors.
Only when he rested comfortably did Sadie rise again, her posture calm. “What’s your plan for Noah’s treatment? And what about Stuart—has he been dealt with?”
She had no special concern for Lawson’s outcome, but she couldn’t ignore Hurst’s ruthless nature.
A mocking twist appeared at the corner of Hurst’s mouth, his expression as cold as ice.
His gaze slid to Sadie’s bandaged hand, taking in the white gauze against her pale skin.
The stark contrast of bandage and skin seemed to magnify her vulnerability. Despite the scene, Hurst’s expression never softened. Any sign of sympathy was missing.
“I see your hand was bandaged.” Hurst’s voice sounded casual, almost indifferent, as if they were discussing the weather. “You still don’t trust me?”
Sadie locked eyes.
She stood firm, unflinching beneath his unreadable stare. “Is there any reason I should trust you?” she asked, her words sharp and entirely warranted.
Trust was never a word that belonged in the same sentence as Hurst.
A soft, humorless laugh slipped from him as he dodged her question entirely.
For someone like Hurst, trust was irrelevant—only the outcome ever mattered. Turning away, he set his attention on Noah, who lay on the bed, more like a puzzle than a patient.
“I read Mr. Wall’s file on the way here. To say his situation is critical is putting it mildly.”
Tension thickened the air, as if the temperature had suddenly dropped. Sadie’s fingers curled tight at her side, an involuntary reaction she couldn’t suppress.
Reality had never blinded her to Noah’s fragile state, but hearing Hurst say it so plainly brought a fresh wave of dread.
Whether he noticed or not, Hurst gave no sign that her distress mattered to him. He continued speaking in that emotionless tone.
Your escape begins with g?lnσνsm
“Stuart’s so-called solution—putting a chip in Mr. Wall’s brain—might keep him alive for now.” A derisive smile left his lips. “But don’t mistake it for a real fix. That’s only a bandage, hardly the kind of solution this calls for.”
A somber shadow crossed Sadie’s face.
Facts were facts, and she could not deny the truth in his words.
A reckless person like Stuart was bound to chase after desperate, half-baked answers, leaving a trail of consequences behind.
Still, the confidence in Hurst’s manner said he was nowhere near finished. There was a dangerous depth to him—Hurst never showed his full hand and could never be predicted.noveldrama
“So what exactly are you suggesting?” she asked, enunciating each word clearly.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1235:
Hurst turned around at a slow, deliberate pace, meeting her gaze without hesitation.
He lifted his right hand, letting his fingers sweep through the air with careful precision.
“The plan is straightforward. By using a specially crafted long needle, I puncture Mr. Wall’s eardrum and go straight into his brain. That way, all the blood clots buried deep inside can be drawn out. The last time I treated him, I only managed to pull out a few clots on the surface. That wasn’t enough to fix what’s wrong.”
Sadie felt a sharp shiver crawl all the way up her spine.
The very idea made her insides twist.
It sounded like sheer torment, not treatment.
Hurst’s lips curled up a bit more. He was clearly entertained by the fear in her.
“You need to understand, this approach is incredibly dangerous,” he added leisurely. “If luck is on our side, the blood clots will be removed and Mr. Wall might wake up. He could even get his life back. But if things go wrong…” Hurst paused, his gaze teasing. “Then we might be left with someone who can’t think or speak at all. At that point, Ms. Hudson, you’ll have no choice but to start preparing to say goodbye.”
His explanation landed hard, each word digging deeper into Sadie’s chest.
A sudden coldness swept over her.
She shot Hurst a look so fierce, it could have cut glass.
Hurst merely shrugged, acting as though her anger didn’t mean anything to him.
He even lifted his hands in mock innocence.noveldrama
“Please, Ms. Hudson. There’s no need to glare at me like that.”
“Though my words may sound harsh, you can’t deny the truth,” Hurst remarked calmly.
Life and death weighed in the balance, yet he spoke as if the outcome hardly mattered.
Sadie felt her chest tighten, breath quickening as she sharply turned away. On the hospital bed, Noah’s face still wore that sickly pallor, yet his eyes shone with unexpected clarity.

He stayed silent, watching her with that gentle look she knew all too well.
Inside Sadie’s chest, her heart pounded with confusion and dread.
Could she truly risk everything and let Noah’s fate rest on this chance?
Success would mean more years with him—maybe even a full recovery.
Losing? That outcome was unthinkable.
The possibilities were almost too awful to imagine.
Yet, letting things stay as they were meant watching Noah fade with every passing day.
Every word from Hurst hung heavy, demanding a decision she did not want to make.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1236:
Making this choice felt impossible, almost inhuman.
Hurst sensed her uncertainty.
He checked his watch and spoke with careful patience. “Take all the time you need, Ms. Hudson. It’s Mr. Wall’s life on the line, after all. But time waits for no one.”
With arms folded, he leaned back, acting more like a spectator at a play than a doctor in the thick of things.
Sadie bit down hard on her lip, fighting the panic rising inside.
Fresh pain pulsed from her injured palm, drawing her further into distress.
Her thoughts spun out of control, each one shouting a different answer.
How could she possibly choose?
The weight of it all almost crushed her, but before she could voice her answer, a fragile yet steady voice broke the silence.
“Alright.”
Noah had spoken.
His head lifted, and he managed a small, reassuring smile. “We’ll go with your plan.”noveldrama
Shock widened Sadie’s eyes.
What if fate turned against them?
Her knees threatened to give out, fingers numb with fear.
Noah’s hand found hers, the gesture soft and reassuring. “Sadie, I want nothing more than to stay with you and Averi, always.” He saw right through her fear.
His own anxiety lurked just beneath the surface. The thought of never seeing her again haunted him as well.
Tears rushed to Sadie’s eyes, turning them red in an instant.
She clasped his hand with fierce determination.
To be with her, he would gladly stake his life.
M d?  g.?
What reason did she have left to hesitate?
Gathering every shred of courage, she forced her answer out. “Okay.” That single answer landed between them, impossibly heavy.
Recognition deepened Hurst’s expression, as if he had always expected this outcome.
Together, the three mapped out every step of the treatment plan.
Rest finally called Noah, and once he fell asleep, Sadie slipped out to join Hurst in the hallway.
A soft click of the door muffled the hospital room behind them.
Breaking at last, her voice quivered as she asked, “Tell me honestly—how likely is this to work?”
Titles and power meant nothing now; all that remained was a woman terrified of losing the man she loved.
Leaning against the cold wall, Hurst folded his arms with casual ease. He tipped his head, pausing as if carefully thinking, though a wry smile tugged at his lips.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1237:
After a moment’s silence, his reply came lazy and blunt. “Fifty percent.”
Anger surged through Sadie, and for a moment, darkness threatened to overwhelm her.
To her, that sounded no better than a coin toss.noveldrama
How could anyone put a life on the line so carelessly?
Trusting someone as enigmatic as Hurst felt nearly impossible.
Amusement twinkled in his eyes as Hurst shrugged. “There are too many variables in play. If you need certainty, Ms. Hudson, perhaps you’d rather find another surgeon.”
The answer hit Sadie like a slap, leaving her chest tight with unspoken fury.
Teeth clenched, she fought to steady herself.
At this point, what choice did she have except to place her faith in Hurst, unpredictable as he was?
The weight of powerlessness pressed down, threatening to swallow her whole. After a deep breath and a moment of inner reckoning, she opened her eyes with a determination that burned away every doubt.
“When do we start?”
With her resolve plain as day, Hurst stood upright, dusting off invisible specks from his shirt. “The day is almost over. I need to make a few preparations first.”
Hurst flicked his eyes to his watch. “Tomorrow morning.”
Sadie gave a quiet nod, her silence a fragile dam holding back a tide of irritation.
A sly, unreadable smile tugged at Hurst’s lips. “I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll excuse myself.”
Without another word, he pivoted and strolled off with unhurried ease.
Sadie didn’t bother watching him go.
It was as if the air had been pulled from her lungs—every ounce of strength drained.
She sank into the nearest chair, wrapped in a heavy cloak of weariness that pressed down on her like dusk falling fast.
I€?? ￠н?ρтε ?η g?lиσνε.c?m
Just then, the sound of familiar footsteps broke through the silence.
Tina emerged, worry etched into her features.
“Sadie, the situation at the clinic’s been handled. The guests at the opening were reassured, and the scene’s been cleaned up—no further injuries.” She hesitated, her voice faltering slightly before she continued, “Ms. Hudson… our team reported that Hurst took Stuart to that old paint factory on the outskirts. Should we keep tracking him?”
Sadie slowly shook her head, her exhaustion visible in every gesture. “That won’t be necessary, Tina.”
Stuart’s fate no longer mattered.
Whatever lay between him and Hurst was theirs to settle.
All that occupied her mind now was Noah.
Driven by the need to make sure everything stayed under control—or maybe just to feel like she still had some control—Sadie straightened her posture, gathering what little strength she had left.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1238:
“Tina, reach out to every top neurosurgeon in the country—bring them here,” she said, her tone firm despite the weariness tugging at her edges. “Tomorrow, during the surgery, they’ll assist Hurst. He’ll lead the entire procedure.”
She hated placing her trust in a man she couldn’t stand—but right now, Hurst’s skill was the only card left in her hand.
Tina’s expression twisted with unease. She bit her lip, her voice dropping to a cautious murmur. “Sadie, Hurst is slick—too slick. I trust him even less than I ever trusted Nathan. There’s something off about him.” Her concern was sincere.
Complication was the last thing Noah’s fragile condition could afford. Sadie knew. All too well.
Her eyes closed briefly, the weight of the situation pressing her down. Her voice, when it came, was laced with quiet bitterness. “I wish we had another choice, but we don’t, Tina.” Everything now hinged on tomorrow.
Their final gamble. One last shot—sink or swim.
Changing the topic, Sadie asked about the safe. She needed to know whether it had been opened or not.
Tina’s demeanor changed instantly. She grew serious, pulled out a tablet, and handed it over. “It’s open. All contents have been digitized and uploaded.”
Sadie accepted the device with a nod. “Thank you, Tina. Please ask the private investigator to accelerate the investigation.”
Tina gave a quick nod in return and quietly stepped away.
Sadie tapped the screen, opening a photo album. A series of images loaded—documents, records, and then, unexpectedly, a photograph.
It was an old group photo—she and her parents, frozen in time from her childhood.
The edges of the image had yellowed with age, but her parents’ faces remained strikingly clear.
Her fingertips hovered over their faces, lightly tracing the once-familiar contours on the screen.
They looked as if they had smiled just yesterday, yet they now seemed impossibly distant—separated by years, by absence, by silence.
ｍ?ｅ ｕｄｔｅｓ ｎ ｌ?ｖｌ.
She swiped to the next image—and froze.
A document filled the screen. It was a contract.
“Notification of Hiring Dr. Brenda Stewart as a Researcher at NE Research Institute.”noveldrama
Her breath caught.
Brenda Stewart—her mother’s maiden name.
She enlarged the image, her eyes scanning every line of text.
Sadie remembered, even as a child, how often her mother had been away—always traveling for work, gone for weeks at a time.
She had always believed her mother’s frequent absences were due to corporate responsibilities—business trips, meetings. But this?
NE Research Institute? What kind of place was that?
With a jolt of unease, Sadie pulled out her phone, her hands unsteady as she typed.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1239:
The search results appeared quickly.
NE Research Institute—Zupren’s premier pharmaceutical research facility. Or rather, it had been. The institute had shut down 17 years ago after a reported leak of some kind. Seventeen years ago?
The same year the Hudson family had plunged into turmoil.
Sadie’s chest tightened as the pieces began to stir.
Her mother’s mysterious work, the research institute, and the sudden downfall of the Hudsons…
It couldn’t be coincidence. But Noah came first. Everything else—answers, suspicions, the past—would have to wait.
She steadied herself, gently laid the tablet aside, and took a deep breath to smooth over the cracks in her composure.
Then she stepped into the hospital room.
Noah was already fast asleep, his breathing calm and even, his face finally at rest.noveldrama
Sadie lingered by the doorway, watching him quietly. Only after a long moment did she turn and slip out, closing the door softly behind her.
Morning came swiftly.
At precisely ten o’clock, Hurst finally arrived—disheveled, yawning, with shadows beneath his eyes that hinted at a sleepless night.
Sadie’s brows knitted together the moment she saw him.
Had he been up to no good last night?
Tina’s warning from the day before echoed in her mind, rekindling the unease she’d tried so hard to silence.
Hurst, catching the wary look she gave him, stretched lazily, his joints popping with a chorus of soft cracks.
“Don’t worry,” he said with a crooked grin, his voice laced with a cocky, almost mischievous calm. “I’m ready.”
There was something unsettling in that smile—a blend of self-assurance and roguishness that felt out of place on a day like this.
Still, Sadie had no other choice.

She steadied herself, burying her doubts beneath a brittle calm, and met his gaze with quiet resolve. “I’m counting on you.”
The grin slipped from Hurst’s face. For once, he didn’t offer a clever retort.
He gave a solemn nod, then turned toward the operating room. The heavy door swung shut behind him with a slow, echoing thud.
Sadie’s breath caught.
A crushing weight settled on her chest, tightening with every passing second.
Three years ago, Noah had been sent to Zupren’s Rosewood Hospital by his own mother.
It had taken everything Sadie had to bring him home.
And now, was she about to lose Noah again?

###Chapter 1240:
She couldn’t bear the thought.
Her fists curled tight at her sides, nails digging into her clammy palms until they stung.
Her hands were cold, yet damp with sweat—trembling with fear she didn’t dare voice aloud.
Outside the operating room, time crawled with cruel precision—each second a needle pricking at Sadie’s nerves.
She stood rooted to the spot, not knowing how long she’d been there, her legs long since drained of feeling.
Her gaze never wavered from the doors, sealed tight like a vault guarding fate itself.
Then, at last—after what felt like an eternity—the harsh red glow above the doors flickered off. The doors creaked open.
Sadie’s head snapped up; she lurched forward, nearly tripping over her own numb feet.
Her heart thundered, wild and frantic, as though it might tear free from her chest.
“How is he doing?” Her voice cracked, shaking as much as her hands.
Hurst peeled off his mask, revealing a face marked by weariness, though a trace of his usual insouciance still clung to his features.
His gaze met Sadie’s—laden with hesitation, a storm of unspoken words swirling in his eyes.
The mere sight of his expression sent a chill crashing through her chest.
What was that look supposed to mean?
Why wasn’t he saying anything?
What happened to Noah?
Why wouldn’t Hurst just speak?
Her thoughts spiraled, clawing at her sanity.
Your next chapter awaits g?lnσνls?c?m
Sadie’s already pale complexion threatened to fade further, her composure hanging by a thread.noveldrama
Then—finally—Hurst dropped the charade.
He’d been toying with her, punishing her a little for the mistrust she’d shown before.
With a languid shrug, he exhaled. “Relax,” he said smoothly. “For now… he’s pulled through.”
The words hit Sadie like a dam breaking.
Her knees buckled, breath catching as the crushing weight of fear lifted.
Relief surged through her in waves—Noah was alive!
Her chest heaved, her eyes burning hot with sudden tears.
She steadied herself, heart racing again—this time with hope—and moved to rush into the operating room.
Hurst swiftly raised an arm to block her path. “Whoa—hold on,” he said, the nonchalance fading from his voice.

His expression shifted, growing unexpectedly stern. “He’s still under anesthesia. Hasn’t regained consciousness yet. And after a surgery like that, he’s extremely vulnerable. He needs to stay in a sterile environment for a few days. Going in now could risk everything.”
The gravity in his tone pulled Sadie back. She blinked, then gave a faint, distracted nod.
Noah was alive. That was all that mattered. She could wait.
Hurst studied her for a moment, then gave a light shrug, as if to say his part was done.
Without another word, he turned to leave.
But just as he took a step, Sadie’s voice rose behind him. “Hey, Hurst…”
He paused mid-stride.
“You grew up in Zupren, didn’t you?”
“Yeah, kind of. Why?”
Sadie hesitated, her thoughts swirling—but she pressed on. “Have you ever heard of the NE Research Institute?”
The moment the words left her lips, Hurst’s easygoing facade shattered. The relaxed smile disappeared, replaced by a taut seriousness that shifted the air between them.
He turned slightly, one brow arched, a flicker of curiosity crossing his face.noveldrama
“What did you say?” His voice was lower now, deliberate. “The NE Research Institute?”
Sadie blinked, caught off guard by the sudden shift in his tone.
She hadn’t expected such a charged reaction to what she thought was a throwaway question.
Could he actually know something?
Thoughts swirled in her mind, but she masked them behind a calm exterior. She offered a soft shake of her head. “Never mind. It’s nothing,” she said casually. “Just a random question. If it doesn’t ring a bell, forget it. You must be tired—you should get some rest.”

Without another glance, she turned and walked away, leaving Hurst staring after her, puzzled.
He frowned slightly, the gears in his mind turning.
How did she know about the NE Research Institute?
She was more perceptive than he’d given her credit for—and maybe more informed. Interesting.
Sadie reached the end of the hallway before releasing the breath she’d been holding.
Even she didn’t fully understand why the question had slipped out.
Maybe it was the shock from discovering her mother’s employment contract—it had rattled something deep inside her.
There was a feeling she couldn’t shake, a sense that the NE Research Institute was somehow tied to what had happened to her parents.

###Chapter 1242:
And really, how could someone like Hurst, who had grown up in Zupren, not know about it?
The memory of Hurst’s sudden shift in tone lingered in Sadie’s mind, gnawing at her nerves.
Something about it didn’t sit right. The NE Research Institute clearly wasn’t a simple place—certainly not as obscure as she’d assumed.
A quiet tension settled over her, and with a steadying breath, she gathered herself.
Since she wouldn’t be able to see Noah today and the hospital held no more answers for now, she made up her mind to return to Wall Group.
But just as she stepped toward the elevator, the doors slid open—and a bodyguard stepped out.
He gave a respectful bow. “Ms. Hudson, Mr. Castro has regained consciousness.”
Sadie blinked, caught off guard. Then, quickly collecting herself, she asked to see him immediately.
Blaine had been out cold for days, felled by a severe allergic reaction.
Now, at last, he was awake.
When they arrived at the ICU, Lenny—Blaine’s attending physician—was hovering near the bedside, fussing with the monitors a little too anxiously.noveldrama
Sadie’s brow furrowed. “Dr. Holland, how is he doing?”
Lenny flinched at the sound of her voice. A sheen of nervous sweat appeared on his forehead as he quickly turned around. “Ms. Hudson, you’re just a moment too late. Mr. Castro… he just fell asleep again.”
What?
Sadie’s gaze shifted to Blaine, lying motionless with tubes connected, his eyes closed and face pale.
Something felt… off.
“What’s his current condition, exactly?” she asked.

Lenny exhaled, forcing a weary sigh. “He’s still very weak. The prolonged coma took a toll on his body, and he was already exhausted beforehand. His recovery won’t be quick.”
Sadie’s heart sank. Blaine had been pushing himself too hard—for her, no less—digging into matters she couldn’t uncover on her own.
She looked down, guilt flickering in her eyes. “Take care of him,” she said quietly. “Let me know the moment he wakes up.”
Lenny nodded, relief flooding his features as Sadie turned to leave.
Only when her footsteps faded down the corridor did he finally let out the breath he’d been holding.
If Blaine had woken up completely, he wouldn’t be able to complete the task Alex had assigned him.
The sedative he’d just administered was mild, not harmful, but enough to keep Blaine under.
Lenny cast a long look at the man lying motionless on the bed, a flicker of conflict in his eyes. He told himself—this was survival, nothing more.

###Chapter 1243:
Sadie had just settled into her car when her phone buzzed.
It was Noah’s mother.
“Sadie, are you free right now? Why don’t you come to Wall Manor and have lunch with me?”
Sadie checked the time—it was nearing noon. “Alright, I’m on my way.” She hung up, started the car, and drove through the quiet roads.
Half an hour later, she pulled up to the familiar gates of Wall Manor.
As soon as she stepped inside, Averi flung himself at her, wrapping his little arms tightly around her leg.noveldrama
Sadie bent down and scooped him into her arms, inhaling the sweet, warm scent of her son as she kissed his soft cheek.
Just looking into his bright, trusting eyes took away all the exhaustion of the past few days.
“Averi, did you miss Mommy?”
The little boy nodded eagerly, nestling closer into her neck. “I did. Mommy… where’s Daddy?”
The innocent question pierced Sadie’s heart.
Her arms instinctively tightened around him, but her words stalled in her throat. How could she explain something so complicated to someone so young?
But Averi didn’t wait. “Grandma told me everything. Mr. Noel is Daddy. Mommy, I miss Daddy.”
So Isabel had already told him.
It spared Sadie the effort of explaining things herself—but the simple, heartfelt words “I miss Daddy” echoed in her chest like a silent cry.
She gently ran her fingers through Averi’s soft hair, her voice as tender as a whisper. “Daddy’s not feeling well right now, sweetheart. He’s getting treatment. But once he gets better, he’ll come back to see you. I promise.”
The light in Averi’s eyes dimmed, his expression crumpling with quiet disappointment.
Without a word, he wriggled from her embrace and padded over to the corner of the room, settling down beside his toy blocks. He began stacking them absently, his tiny figure weighed down with a sadness no child should have to carry.
Sadie’s heart clenched. The sight of her little boy, so subdued, pierced deeper than any wound.
She owed her son so much. The guilt pressed down on her like a heavy fog.
Just then, the sound of footsteps echoed down the staircase.
Isabel appeared, moving slowly, her eyes landing on the forlorn child in the corner.
A soft sigh escaped her lips, sorrow shadowing her features.
So much had happened. Too much for such a small heart to bear.
Sadie moved quickly to support her.
“How have you been feeling, Isabel? I’m sorry I haven’t come often. Work has been…” She trailed off, her voice tinged with regret.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1244:
Isabel gave her hand a gentle pat, her expression warm despite the fatigue in her eyes.
“You’ve had a lot on your shoulders, Sadie. I understand completely. As for me—I’m just an old woman, not much help these days.” She paused, her tone shifting. “I asked you to come back because there’s something I need to talk to you about.”
Sadie nodded and guided her to the sofa, sensing that whatever was coming next carried weight.
Isabel’s gaze lingered on Averi, who sat quietly stacking blocks, his small shoulders slumped in focus—or perhaps in quiet sorrow. She took a breath, her voice low and deliberate. “I’ve been thinking… I want to take Averi with me to Zupren. I’d like to visit Rosewood Hospital myself, speak to the doctors, and see if there’s another way we can help Noah. And with the two of us out of the way, you’ll be able to do everything you need to do here without worrying about…”
Rosewood Hospital. Zupren.
Sadie’s eyes flickered with subtle emotion.
The suggestion made sense.
With Noah’s condition still hanging by a thread, Hurst’s high-risk treatment uncertain at best, and the looming shadows of the NE Research Institute demanding her attention, things at home had become a tangled web of danger and distraction.noveldrama
Maybe sending Isabel and Averi away—out of this storm—was the smartest choice. The safest choice.
And yet… The idea of being apart from her son left a dull ache in her heart.
But for Isabel’s and Averi’s safety, the choice had already crystallized in Sadie’s mind.
Sadie drew a steadying breath, forcing the turbulent emotions back into their cage. “Alright. I’ll have Samuel make the arrangements. Isabel, traveling all that way alone with Averi—please take care of yourself.”
Relief bloomed across Isabel’s features, softening the worry lines that had etched themselves around her eyes.
A delicate cough escaped her lips. “As long as you all are well, I’m at ease. Averi is in my care, so you needn’t worry. But you, Sadie, take it easy and don’t push yourself too hard.”
Your imagination starts at g ? ln σ ν s?conn
Sadie’s nod came with a telltale shimmer in her eyes, unshed tears catching the light.
What followed was a gentle weaving of conversation about family matters, health concerns, and careful reminders of precautions to take.
Lunch concluded with Sadie glancing at her watch before rising to bid farewell, the weight of parting heavy as she left Wall Manor behind.
She stepped into the crisp air, and before her hand could even reach the car door, her phone’s shrill cry pierced the quiet.
Tina’s name flashed on the screen.
Something cold twisted in Sadie’s stomach, instinct whispering warnings as she pressed the phone to her ear. “What’s up?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1245:
Tina’s voice crackled through the speaker, electric with barely restrained excitement, each word trembling with anticipation. “Sadie! Just as you predicted, a few days ago, Malcolm gathered the old shareholders at Nirvana for a meeting! This morning, a flood of Wall Group shares suddenly hit the market!”
Her voice climbed higher, triumph bleeding through every syllable. “And we’ve snapped up every single one!”
Finally, Sadie’s mouth curved upward, tension melting from her features like ice in sunlight.
The crushing weight that had been pressing against her chest began to ease.
Malcolm couldn’t resist making his move after all.
Perfect. It saved her considerable trouble.
“Good,” Sadie replied.noveldrama
Through the phone, Tina practically radiated triumph, her voice buoyant with vindication.
Malcolm, that scheming old bastard, had orchestrated his machinations so carefully, never dreaming that the shares he’d manipulated shareholders into abandoning would fall entirely into Sadie’s waiting hands!
Poetic justice at its finest.
Sadie’s gaze swept to her elegant watch.
“I’m heading back to the office now. We’ll discuss details later.” She decisively hung up the phone.
Miles away, Tina still clutched her device, adrenaline coursing through her veins as the magnitude of their victory settled in.
Pocketing her phone, she made her way toward the elevator entrance, waiting for Sadie to come back.
Instead, Maxton Prescott materialized before her, his usual composure fractured by obvious distress.
The finance director’s typically unflappable demeanor had cracked, perspiration beading along his hairline despite the office’s cool air.
“Ms. Delgado,” he said, his voice tight. “We’ve encountered a slight miscalculation in our recent analysis. Most of Wall Group’s scattered shares have indeed been quietly reacquired by our team.”
 ?  .
His words faltered, reluctance shadowing his features. “However, a small fraction remains beyond our reach. Not significant, only 0.79%.”
Tina accepted the file from his outstretched hand, her eyes racing across the columns of data. Only 0.79%.
Such a negligible fraction had likely been snatched up by opportunistic individual investors or nimble smaller institutions.
Given the sheer volume of Wall Group shares flooding the market, some slippage was inevitable, and frankly, their acquisition speed had been nothing short of remarkable.
A soft exhale escaped her lips as she closed the file and returned it to Maxton’s waiting hands.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1246:
“It’s fine,” she said with a relaxed tone. “A mere 0.79% won’t trigger any major shifts. Put it out of your mind.”
Relief washed over Maxton’s features, the tension draining from his shoulders. After all, Sadie’s trust in Tina was absolute, and when Tina spoke, her words carried the weight of authority.
With a grateful nod, he retreated to tackle the remaining work on his desk.
Across the city, in a cozy cafe nestled in the southern district, Humphrey savored the document spread before him with evident satisfaction.
His gaze lifted, meeting the expectant eyes across the table.
“Well done. Your payment will arrive in carefully timed installments. However, Alex has his own designs on this acquisition, so I’ve assembled everything you’ll need to counter his moves.”
At Humphrey’s casual wave, his bodyguard stepped forward and placed a file on the table.
Beal glanced up with surprise as he flipped it open, then broke into a grin. “Mr. Perry, truly brilliant.”
Roughly thirty minutes passed before Beal stepped into the Howe family’s estate, clutching the file under his arm.
The file exchanged hands, and Alex skimmed the first page—a legal confirmation that he’d secured 7.9% of Wall Group’s shares. Satisfaction flickered in his eyes, a smile threatening to break free.
Snagging this particular stake marked the first—and most important—move in the quiet war to shake Wall Group’s foundation and pull every ounce of power away from Noah.
Shifting his gaze, Alex regarded Beal, who stood before him, posture impeccably formal.
“Well done, Beal. Settling in all right with the new role?”
Deference colored every word as Beal inclined his head. “Everything’s in order, sir. The transition was smooth, and I’ve familiarized myself with the entire operation.”
Appreciation showed in the way Alex’s features softened, his approval unmistakable.
Your next chapter is here gα?ησνs?com
Fingers drummed a slow rhythm on the document, and he spoke with a trace of satisfaction. “Now that we hold 7.9% of the shares, the rest should fall into place. The path ahead will be much smoother.”
Confidence radiated from him, as if he already pictured Wall Group’s mighty fortress collapsing, and the day Sadie would belong to him.
At that moment, Egan entered, ushering in Malcolm.
Any trace of arrogance had vanished from Malcolm’s demeanor; before Alex, he adopted an air of meek obedience.
A quick glance from Alex sent Beal a silent message.noveldrama
Beal picked up on the signal at once and slipped out of the room without a word.
Just outside, Beal paused by the door, taking a careful look around before leaning in, his ear pressed against the wood, determined not to miss a single word.
For Humphrey, every snippet of Alex’s plotting mattered.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1247:
Meanwhile, Malcolm followed instructions, sitting on the sofa and pasting a servile smile on his face.
“So, Mr. Howe, what’s next? Just give me the signal.” Eager hands rubbed together, his gaze betraying hunger for more. “Will you arrange for me to meet the boy—Salex?” This child held the key to their entire scheme.
Seeing Salex up close would settle Malcolm’s nerves and let him move forward with confidence.
Suspicion never left Malcolm’s mind—dealing with Alex always felt like navigating a maze. He knew he needed to stay alert.
A sly, unreadable smile flickered on Alex’s lips as he heard the request, but his eyes went icy cold. “Is something wrong, Mr. Pierce? Or is it that you don’t trust me?”noveldrama
No one would get close to Salex so easily. For Alex, the boy was his ultimate ace.
Malcolm, sharp as ever, was clearly working an angle of his own.
An awkward beat passed before Malcolm let out a brittle chuckle. “Not at all, Mr. Howe. I only want to make sure we’re covering every detail.”
A fresh wave of caution washed over him—Alex was dangerous and impossible to predict.
Clearly, any hope of seeing the boy today had vanished.
Even so, Malcolm decided that as long as they could bring down Noah and split Wall Group’s assets, the gamble was justified. A quiet scoff from Alex closed the subject for good.
“There’s nothing for you to worry about. Salex is too young for these introductions,” Alex said, dismissing the idea with a single wave.
Without missing a beat, he shifted the conversation. “Now, what’s the latest on those shareholders?”
The realization that he’d been stonewalled made Malcolm grit his teeth in silence.
Still, he forced a bright tone. “Everything’s under control. Even if those stubborn old men make trouble, they’ll only be aiming for Wall Group. No one’s looking in my direction.”
The shareholders Malcolm had supposedly worked with were simply chess pieces—fodder for the chaos inside Wall Group, designed to keep Sadie and Noah busy and off-balance.
€$t ￠?αρ?ёя? 1π [dot]com
A razor-sharp look from Alex warned Malcolm not to overstep, cold and cutting. He could use Malcolm as needed, but wouldn’t tolerate a single threat to Sadie’s safety.
A chill swept through Malcolm as Alex’s unspoken threat hung in the air.
Understanding exactly what Alex expected, Malcolm thumped his chest, eager to reassure. “Please, Mr. Howe, you have my guarantee. None of this will ever touch Ms. Hudson. You have my word.”
Alex’s affection for Sadie was plain as day, but Malcolm had no interest in the man’s feelings—his only focus was personal profit.
Sensing the meeting had run its course, Malcolm bowed politely. “It’s getting late. I’ll take my leave now, Mr. Howe.” Not a single word left Alex’s lips. Instead, he lifted his coffee mug, savoring a slow, deliberate sip.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1248:
Meanwhile, Beal, lurking just outside, caught the sound of footsteps approaching and instinctively melted into the shadows.
Eyes narrowed, he tracked Malcolm’s exit, suspicion etched into every line of his face.
Clearly, the old fox was up to his neck in this scheme. And as for Salex, the boy seemed to be the linchpin of the entire operation. Humphrey needed to know about this, and fast.
Steeling himself to slip away unnoticed, Beal was caught off guard when a sharp, icy voice sliced through the silence. “Who are you?”
Instantly, Beal’s muscles locked, and a jolt of fear shot through him. He whipped around, searching for the source.
There stood Hailey, her appearance unexpected and unnerving. Just how long she’d been standing there was impossible to tell.
A flimsy nightgown clung to her, ghostly pale against her skin, but her gaze was razor-sharp and unflinching.
A quick glance told Beal no one else was in sight—he was alone with her.
Wasn’t she supposed to be locked away by Alex?
Questions raced through his mind. How had she slipped free? And, more importantly, how much of that conversation had she caught? Allowing her to compromise Humphrey’s plans was unthinkable.
In an instant, Beal’s eyes hardened, all traces of mercy vanishing.noveldrama
He moved in a flash, seizing Hailey by the throat before she could react.
Her resistance meant nothing as he dragged her roughly, forcing her toward the shadowy garden.
Hailey’s voice was laced with ice. “Whatever you witnessed or overheard, you’ll seal it away and never let it surface. If not, you might want to start counting your days.”
Hailey’s throat pulsed in agony, and a paralyzing dread swept over her. Her porcelain features turned scarlet, each breath scraping like sandpaper in her lungs. She wheezed, struggling to inhale.
With desperation in her eyes, Hailey shook her head fiercely, panic gleaming in her stare.
Beal’s expression hardened at her reaction, and without warning, he let go.
Le$? ΔTR? 1π lnovels.cm
Without anything to hold her up, Hailey stumbled and hit the frosty ground, limbs awkward. Grasping at her throat, she hacked uncontrollably, the suffocating pressure leaving her rattled.
Beal tossed a final indifferent look her way, then spun on his heel and exited the garden swiftly.
Hailey tracked his vanishing silhouette, her hands balling tightly, fingernails piercing her skin.
That man—wasn’t he just the new assistant Alex had hired? And yet he dared to handle her like trash?
Silently, she cursed him with venom.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1249:noveldrama
Humiliation and fury surged within her like a tide. Still… why had that man been lurking near the door earlier? And what exactly had Alex and Malcolm been discussing in the living room? She also overheard them uttering the name “Salex” a few times. Who was that?
A strange unease prickled at her.
Hailey scrambled up, patting the earth off her sleepwear.
Now wasn’t the moment for reflection—she needed to uncover the truth another time.
That wretched Alex had her locked down, turning the house into a gilded cage. Lately, she’d swallowed her pride and acted submissive just to earn a sliver of freedom.
Sadie. Only then had Alex allowed her a brief thirty-minute window of freedom within the estate each day.
When had she ever suffered such disgrace?
A cold flame flickered in her eyes. Someday, she vowed, he’d regret every bit of it.
Meanwhile, Beal had left the estate and was scanning his surroundings with caution. He switched vehicles halfway through his route to shake off any tails and eventually pulled up, unseen, outside the reclusive Perry Villa on the city’s edge. Inside the low-lit living room, Humphrey sat alone, absentmindedly swirling a dark crimson drink in his glass.
He shot a glance toward the man standing before him, his brows faintly knitted in annoyance.
“I warned you to only come if it’s critical. Alex is alert. If he connects the dots, everything we’ve worked for unravels.” His tone carried clear irritation.
Beal lowered his head respectfully, posture stiff. “Mr. Perry, I had no choice. Just now, Alex met with one of the Wall Group shareholders, Malcolm Pierce, at home. From what I gathered, several stakeholders from Wall Group have unloaded their shares all of a sudden because of Malcolm’s manipulations. They’re clearly stirring unrest, hoping to rally discontented investors against Wall Group and Sadie. And… Alex seems overprotective of her.”
The moment Sadie’s name came up, Humphrey’s hand tensed around the stem of the glass. It shattered with a crisp snap, red liquid and jagged fragments spilling between his fingers.
He didn’t even flinch. His stare was glacial, his presence frightening.
Three years earlier, Alex’s blind devotion to that vile Sadie had hurt Humphrey’s older sister, Aliza, deeply. Now, after all this time, Alex still intended to shield Sadie? That wouldn’t be allowed.
L?tеst chαpt?rs in glnovels.m
Humphrey slowly lifted his gaze. There was a storm of rage and chaos behind those eyes.
“Then neither of them walks away unscathed. Handle it.”
Beal immediately understood what he implied and gave a solemn nod. “Yes, Mr. Perry.”
” Without another word, he slipped out.

###Chapter 1250:
Outside, dusk draped the sky in blood-red streaks.
Sadie had just wrapped up her final task for the day and was about to pack up when her office door flew open with a bang.
Tina rushed in, panic etched across her face, her hair damp with sweat.
“Sadie—bad news!” she gasped, trying to steady her breath.
Seeing her so flustered, Sadie quickly poured water into a glass and handed it over.
“Breathe. Tell me what happened.”
Tina took it, not even minding how scalding it was, and gulped it down before she could speak clearly.
“The old shareholders who dumped their stakes in Wall Group—they’ve all shown up. They’re downstairs, demanding answers… and they’ve dragged a swarm of reporters with them!”
A jolt of surprise left Sadie momentarily stunned.
Regret seemed to haunt those shareholders who had once sold their shares without a second thought for their own interests. Watching Wall Group’s stock climb, they now scrambled to stir up trouble, desperate to claw back what they’d lost.
Some people, it seemed, never found satisfaction—greed only ever demanded more.
A subtle smirk flickered on Sadie’s lips, betraying her disdain.
Tina caught the look and hurried to fill in the rest. “That’s not all—they’re saying exactly the same thing, like they rehearsed it. They say that you bullied them into selling so you could snatch up the whole Wall Group for yourself. It’s just disgusting!”
A wave of anger swept over Tina, and color rushed to her cheeks.
Without letting her composure slip, Sadie said, “First, call the police. I’ll go down and see for myself what’s going on.”
In one smooth motion, she swept her coat from the back of her chair, pulling it on as she strode for the door.
It took Tina a moment to process what had happened.

A swarm of shareholders and reporters waited below, and Sadie, alone, would be walking into a hostile crowd.
Anxious, Tina bolted after her, flagging down the first administration employee she saw. “Hurry—call the police right now! Then get every security guard you can find to the front entrance!”
She didn’t waste a second explaining, breaking into a run for the elevators. The young man, startled, just stood frozen, unsure what to make of Tina’s urgency.
Instinct soon kicked in. He crossed to the window and peered down, heart sinking as he spotted the chaos spilling across the company’s main entrance.
Realizing how serious things were, he jumped into action.noveldrama
Meanwhile, Sadie rode the CEO’s private elevator straight to the lobby. As soon as the doors slid open, she was greeted by a blinding storm of camera flashes, the air alive with the relentless snap of shutters.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1251:
Noise crashed over her in waves—the lobby was sheer pandemonium. “Over here! Sadie Hudson’s here!” someone bellowed, and in a heartbeat, the media surged toward her, encircling her like predators closing in on prey. Any security posted at the doors found themselves hopelessly outmatched by the sheer force of the crowd.
“Ms. Hudson, are the rumors true? Did you coerce the senior shareholders to sell just so you could seize total control?” A reporter shoved a microphone so close to Sadie’s face it almost brushed her cheek.
Another voice called out above the commotion, “Ms. Hudson, how do you answer these accusations? What’s your response to the claims against you?”
“Can you tell us whether the recent acquisition of those shares was orchestrated by you, Ms. Hudson?”
Relentless questions pelted her, every word pointed and insistent.
Just then, Tina burst into the fray, flanked by security who muscled their way forward to create a protective barrier around Sadie.noveldrama
“Ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your cooperation,” Tina announced, her voice rising above the crowd. “Wall Group’s PR team will release a formal statement soon. Please remain patient until then.”
Juggling crisis control, Tina worked hard to keep the chaos from spiraling further.
Instead of shrinking back, Sadie slipped out from behind Tina’s shield, her posture unyielding. She met the crowd’s gaze head-on, coolly reading each expression—some brimming with anticipation, others savoring the spectacle, and a few simply along for the ride. A thin, chilling smile touched her lips.
By now, she saw no need to protect the dignity of those who’d already betrayed her.
“Let’s be honest. Who among you couldn’t wait to dump your shares for a quick profit and then tried to use the fallout to pressure me out? I don’t think I need to say names—we all know the answer. Justice doesn’t need my voice. The authorities are already involved, and I trust the police to reveal the facts before long.”
Her tone was calm but cut through the uproar with undeniable authority. Shock swept through the group of shareholders who’d been shouting only minutes ago.
Involving the police was a move they hadn’t seen coming, and panic set in. Backed into a corner, they scrambled to salvage what little they could, even if it meant bluffing for survival.
One man mustered a composed front and told Sadie, “Ms. Hudson, no one wants this to escalate. If you’re willing to return our shares at the original price, we’ll put this behind us—let’s just return to business as usual.”
Discover your escape on g aln ov el s .com
Dread gnawed at the shareholders, knowing what that request truly meant: everything they’d worked for now hung in the balance. Their plans had been upended, leaving them with nothing to show for their schemes.
With desperation mounting, they clung to the faint hope that Sadie might just agree to their terms. If she relented, they could accept the outcome. Yet every one of them knew, deep down, Sadie was not someone so easily swayed.
The shriek of approaching patrol vehicles pierced the air, growing louder by the second.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1252:
Moments ago, the smug shareholders had exuded confidence—now, visible dread clouded their features. Not one of them had genuinely believed Sadie would involve the authorities. The strained deadlock between both parties tightened, reaching a breaking point.
At last, an elder among the stakeholders, trembling and drenched in perspiration, stepped through the group, unable to restrain himself. Choking back sobs, he said, “Ms. Hudson, I’m entirely to blame. I let myself be manipulated and strayed from sound judgment. I never intended to relinquish my shares. Wall Group has been more than business—it’s been a second home. I couldn’t possibly betray that. I’m pleading—please, grant me another chance!” His outburst left the entire crowd speechless.
Once someone broke ranks, the rest surged forward as if clinging to a lifeline, each voicing their desperation. “Exactly, Ms. Hudson—we were misled.” “Our loyalty to Wall Group has never wavered.” “Please, just this once, forgive us!”
The tide shifted so suddenly that even the press stationed nearby faltered in shock.
Then, instinct taking over, they raised their equipment to record the astonishing shift.
Sadie’s eyes swept over the gathering, devoid of warmth. When the waters had been still, these people had leaned on their tenure to corner her, conspiring behind closed doors. Now exposed, they morphed into pitiful figures feigning helplessness.
Such irony in human behavior was both cruel and laughable.
Silently, she scoffed. If these weren’t the founding figures of Wall Group, she wouldn’t have hesitated to dismiss them on the spot. Yet removing so many senior figures at once would stir chaos—an unwelcome disruption for Wall Group’s current situation.
Still, their betrayal meant they could no longer be entrusted with authority. Keeping them in power would only invite future disloyalty and make them tools for others to exploit.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Sadie addressed the crowd, her voice steady and unwavering. “You’ve poured decades into building Wall Group. Now, at this stage in life, it’s time to enjoy the peace you’ve earned. If you’d like the younger generation in your family to step into your shoes, feel free to nominate someone competent. Should they meet the required standards, they’ll inherit your roles. If not, rest assured the corporation will fulfill its obligations and provide what’s rightfully yours in accordance with company guidelines once you step down. However, let me be perfectly clear on one matter.”
She paused, her eyes narrowing, her tone turning ice-cold.
“Anyone considering manipulation or attempting to install someone they can control—think twice. If it happens, I won’t respond as leniently as I did today.”
?@? @t?è íń .
A heavy silence fell. The lobby tensed as tension swirled. Unease crept across the shareholders’ faces like shadows at dusk.
They looked stunned, immobilized, as if their thoughts had frozen in place.
Sadie’s decree had obliterated their last shred of comfort.
At that moment, they realized what this move truly meant. She was initiating a full-scale internal cleanse—clearing out every trace of disloyalty and rot. Trying to rig the heir nomination process would only hasten their downfall and strip away whatever pride they had left.noveldrama

###Chapter 1253:
Those who once voiced pleadings now stood defeated, resembling withered husks.
There was nothing else to be done.
Compared to total expulsion and disgrace, her offer was, regrettably, a much better option.
With evident reluctance, the shareholders inclined their heads, lips stretching into uneasy grins.
“We understand, Ms. Hudson.” “Your directive is noted.” “You can count on our cooperation.”
Sadie gave the slightest incline of her head, watching them line up in submission.
One by one, under the quiet direction of security, the crowd trickled out.
Turning toward the press still loitering nearby, she offered a measured smile. “Dear members of the press, if there are no further inquiries, kindly disperse for now.
“Formal statement regarding today’s events will be issued later by Wall Group’s public relations department.”
A bespectacled reporter leaned forward and raised his mic. “Ms. Hudson, considering the recent upheaval at Wall Group, will the International Business Exchange still proceed as intended next month?” It was the question on everyone’s lips.
Sadie’s composure didn’t falter. A glint of assurance flashed in her gaze. “We appreciate your concern,” she responded. “Preparations for the International Business Exchange began weeks in advance. When the day arrives, Wall Group will be ready to receive you all with a brand-new look. Stay tuned.” Her message, delivered with poise, left no room for uncertainty.
The reporters exchanged glances, evidently impressed by her conviction. They refrained from further questioning and started to leave under the supervision of the guards.
Sadie watched them go, then turned and stepped back inside.
Reaching her office, she sank into the plush cushions of the lounge chair—only for Tina to barge in moments later, clearly just back from wrapping up coordination with the authorities.
She was flushed, and her anger hadn’t cooled.noveldrama
gα?ησν?s?com, where the best stories live
“Sadie! Are we seriously going to let those slippery old foxes off that easily?”
Irritation still burned in Tina’s eyes. Getting away with a stunt like that was simply out of the question. How could anyone be so brazen? Those same shareholders had been the first to jump ship when stock prices dropped, and now that Wall Group was back on the rise, they dared to try and rewrite history? The nerve was unbelievable.
Across the desk, Sadie stayed poised, her every move deliberate. She reached for her water glass and took a slow, measured sip. What mattered most was unmasking the puppet master—the one orchestrating the chaos from behind the scenes.
Tina, quick-witted as always, immediately understood. “Sadie, do you think Malcolm’s behind this?”
A small nod confirmed it. Sadie’s gaze grew colder and more determined. Malcolm’s cunning and ambition were well known; he was never content to stand on the sidelines. In moments like these, Sadie knew Wall Group needed to make an example—show others that reckless schemes came with consequences.

###Chapter 1254:
The realization dawned on Tina, her expression brightening with understanding. She nodded with resolve. “Got it! I’ll reach out to the legal department and have them put together everything we need,” she said.
She had barely turned away when her phone chimed, the sound cutting through the room’s silence. A glance at her screen changed Tina’s expression in an instant.
Sadie caught the shift and asked quietly, “What’s wrong? Did something happen?”
A shaky breath escaped Tina as she looked up. “The private investigator just messaged me. He has an update. He says that, on the day everything happened in the urban village, Mr. Wall arranged for Jack to run an errand and Jack was gone for a while. He’s not sure what Jack was up to—everything happened quickly and was kept under wraps.”
The news sent a chill down Sadie. Her fingers closed tightly around her glass as the weight of new suspicion pressed down on her.
No words left her lips; instead, Sadie kept her eyes fixed on Tina, waiting for her to continue.
Anxious now, Tina asked, her tone cautious, “Sadie, can you tell me what’s happening? Why did you need a private investigator to look into Mr. Wall?”
A heavy pause hung in the air before Sadie reached over, slid open her desk drawer, and retrieved the phone Alex had given to her. She passed it to Tina without a word.
Curiosity quickly overtook caution. Tina unlocked the phone.
Shock flooded her features the instant she saw the unsent message staring up from the screen. For a moment, she seemed frozen in place, unable to move or speak. Then her voice broke through, incredulous. “This… it doesn’t make sense! There’s no way Mr. Wall would rescue Hailey. Why would he do that?”
Deep down, Sadie longed to believe in Noah, too. No one knew his character better than she did. Unfortunately, each piece of evidence now pointed toward a possibility that made her chest ache.noveldrama
A raspy whisper escaped her as she finally spoke. “What’s the latest on Jack’s condition?”
Gloom settled over Tina’s expression. She shook her head, her voice dropping low. “I reached out to the hospital. Jack’s still in the ICU. They say his chances are slim—waking up doesn’t seem likely.”
A shadow passed through Sadie’s eyes as her thoughts drifted inward, Hurst.
gα ? ησ ν s?com has it all
Suddenly, one name came to her.
Though Hurst came across as carefree and seemingly unreliable, his unconventional and often shocking methods had a way of producing miraculous results. After all, it was Hurst’s unorthodox approach that pulled Noah through his own surgery.
If anyone could give Jack a fighting chance, it might be him.
Secrecy was vital now. Not a soul could be allowed to find out.
Instructions came swiftly and unwavering from Sadie. “Tina, head straight to Hurst’s clinic. Tell him to check on Jack at the hospital, and be sure this stays completely under wraps. Not a word to anyone.”
Even with questions piling up, Tina caught the urgency written all over Sadie’s face. She answered with a determined nod. “Understood. I’ll handle it right away.”
.

.
###Chapter 1255:
Without waiting another second, Tina spun on her heel and hurried out the door. Thirty minutes later, she pushed through the glass doors of Hurst’s clinic in the heart of the city.
Every detail of Sadie’s message was delivered, word for word, to Hurst, who seemed entirely absorbed in a video game, legs propped up, and posture completely relaxed.
For a split second, the game was forgotten as Hurst cocked an eyebrow, mischief flickering across his face. “So, you want me to pull off a miracle?” he said, a sly grin tugging at his lips.
The game controller was set aside, and Hurst stretched, exuding lazy indifference. “Ms. Delgado, surely you know I don’t work miracles for free. My services come at a steep price.”
Annoyance flared in Tina’s eyes. The casual act grated on her nerves. Time and again, Hurst had a way of teasing when things turned serious.
Her patience snapped. “Dr. Lawson!” she snapped, her voice rising. “If it weren’t for Sadie, you wouldn’t be sitting here with time for games. She’s the reason you’re even safe! And this is how you repay her—by making things difficult?”
A laugh broke from Hurst, genuinely entertained by her outburst. Rising from his chair with exaggerated slowness, he drew out every movement. “There’s no reason for you to lose your temper. Let’s not mix personal favors with business.”
Faced with Hurst’s unbending resolve—and realizing he wouldn’t budge without her agreement—Tina finally gave in. “Alright, Dr. Lawson. What exactly do you want?”
A flicker of triumph crossed Hurst’s face. He looked up, a faint, enigmatic smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “It’s nothing complicated. I just want to know—what’s sparked Ms. Hudson’s sudden curiosity about the NE Research Institute?”
Tina’s eyes widened at his question. NE Research Institute? Why did that name sound so oddly familiar?
Her brows knitted together as she sifted through her thoughts. Suddenly, it clicked. That was the same institute tied to those documents in the safe Sadie had uncovered at Faron Retreat, wasn’t it?
After they’d cracked the safe, they’d pulled out a stack of research files and notes—all connected to the NE Research Institute. So why was Hurst bringing it up now? What business could a doctor like him possibly have with events that had taken place so long ago?
A wary suspicion flickered in Tina’s eyes as she watched him closely.
€$? ?н€?$ 1? glov?l.?m
Hurst caught her pause and gave a lazy shrug, as if the whole thing was nothing. “No need to be suspicious, Ms. Delgado. My interest is just that—interest. I grew up in Zupren, after all. That country is familiar to me. Who knows, maybe I can even offer Ms. Hudson a hand,” he said with practiced ease, the logic sounding reasonable enough.
Tina weighed her options in silence. This wasn’t some state secret, but it also wasn’t entirely trivial. Sharing a little information seemed harmless.noveldrama
Besides, Sadie clearly trusted Hurst far more than most. If that wasn’t the case, Sadie wouldn’t have sent her to ask for his help at such a critical moment.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1256:
After a small pause, Tina answered, “From what I’ve gathered, Sadie’s mother, Brenda Stewart, used to be employed by the NE Research Institute. Beyond that, I don’t know anything at all.”
As soon as the words left her lips, all traces of Hurst’s teasing disappeared. His eyes grew colder, sharp as blades, and for the first time that day, his whole demeanor turned deadly serious. A faint crease appeared between his brows.
“Where’s her mother now?” The urgency in his voice couldn’t be missed.
Tina’s confusion only deepened at his reaction. What was this about? Why was Hurst suddenly so intense? Did he actually have a connection to Sadie’s mother?
She hesitated, uncertain, then shook her head. “I have no idea, either. Sadie’s still searching for her. Her mother vanished seventeen years ago. The only sign of her surfaced five years back at Faron Retreat, but after that, the whole place was wiped out in a fire. No leads, nothing left.”
Hurst was quiet for a long moment. He dropped his gaze, eyes hidden beneath his lashes, his thoughts impossible to read. A thick tension settled over the room as his silence dragged on.
When Tina saw him retreat inward, her nerves tightened. She cleared her throat and broke the silence, saying, “Dr. Lawson, I’ve told you everything I know. Will you help us now?”
That seemed to jolt Hurst from his reverie. He met her eyes, his trademark smile curling back into place, though this time it rang hollow. “Naturally. I stand by my promises—if I say I’ll help, I do.”
Tina felt a small wave of relief wash over her. With Hurst on their side, hope still lingered for Jack. A glance at her watch reminded her of the time.
“We should get moving. It’s getting late.”
An hour later, the two of them stepped into the ICU at Jazmah Hopevale Hospital. Hurst slipped into a sterile gown before giving Jack a swift but thorough assessment.
Jack’s condition was dire—internal bleeding, shattered bones, vital organs ruptured. That he’d survived this long was almost beyond belief.
From the sidelines, Tina observed Hurst’s steady, measured actions, frustration simmering beneath her calm. Unable to wait any longer, she stepped closer. “Can you save him or not?”
g ? ln σ ν ?s?com, where stories thrive
Hurst halted at her question and studied her face. A moment passed before he answered, “There’s a chance. But I can’t promise he’ll ever wake up. And if he does, there’s no telling if he’ll… still be himself.”
Tina’s chest tightened with dread. But faced with impossible odds, there wasn’t a real choice. “Do everything you can. I’ll update Sadie.”noveldrama
She pulled out her phone and quietly slipped out of the ICU. Hurst watched her go, silent, then turned back and began prepping for the emergency surgery.
Tina rushed down the corridor, only stopping at the far end to call Sadie. Her update was swift and to the point—she outlined Jack’s precarious state and spelled out Hurst’s terms for assistance. She made sure to include the strange part: Hurst’s sudden interest in the NE Research Institute.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1257:
Even as she explained it, Tina found herself puzzled. What could possibly drive someone like Hurst—so clearly motivated by self-interest—to put in this much effort just to get a single answer? The logic simply escaped her.
Sadie’s breathing momentarily halted. She was startled by what she heard on the phone. The NE Research Institute—the words echoed sharply in her mind. She distinctly remembered Hurst’s odd, almost guarded reaction when she’d casually mentioned the institute during their last conversation. Now, he himself had reopened the subject. Perhaps he genuinely knew more than he’d previously let on.
“Alright, keep watch over Hurst. I’ll be at the hospital shortly.”
Tina replied promptly, “Got it, Sadie.”
Ending the call, she cast an uncertain glance at the firmly closed ICU doors behind her. If Hurst genuinely had the skill to awaken Jack, could he also help Blaine? He had been unconscious for far too long, too. Initially, the doctor brushed it off as a mild allergy, yet days later, here he remained—something clearly wasn’t right.
After nearly an hour, the ICU doors finally swung open, and Hurst stepped out quietly. He removed his mask, casually rubbing his hands together, his face void of any revealing emotion.
Tina approached hurriedly, her voice anxious but hopeful, asking, “Dr. Lawson, is there any improvement?”
Hurst cast her a bland glance, betraying nothing. “Keep your expectations realistic. I don’t know either. I’ve done everything I could. The rest is up to fate.” He spoke lightly, as if he’d merely checked off an everyday task.
Still, Tina felt a tiny glimmer of relief bloom within her. As long as Hurst was trying, it meant Jack had a fighting chance.
“That’s reassuring,” she said with a sigh, releasing some of her pent-up tension. Suddenly, embarrassment crept onto her face as another thought crossed her mind. She hesitated briefly, glancing nervously at Hurst. “Actually, Dr. Lawson…”
Could I trouble you for one more thing? There’s someone else I’d appreciate you taking a quick look at.”
A flicker of weary irritation passed briefly across Hurst’s face. What was going on with people around Sadie lately? So many of them seemed injured or unconscious. At this rate, he might as well join her staff permanently as the resident medic. Hurst felt a bit like he’d unwillingly become the go-to healer for their personal battalion.
Yet, when he caught sight of Tina’s hopeful, pleading expression, his irritation dissolved quietly into reluctant sympathy. Well, why not? He wasn’t in the worst mood today. One extra patient wouldn’t break his back.
Iе$т ￠#αp?êяs Iи galnoνels.com
“Fine. Get moving. Show me where that patient is.” A flick of his hand told Tina he wanted no delays.
At that, Tina’s whole face brightened, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “You’re the best, Dr. Lawson! Thank you. He’s right next door—really close by.” Determined not to give Hurst any reason to reconsider, Tina hurriedly guided him along.
Just as they arrived at the neighboring room, something stopped them abruptly. At the far end of the corridor, Sadie’s familiar silhouette approached, her bearing as collected and poised as ever. She moved swiftly toward them, her eyes pausing briefly on Hurst, a subtle glint of suspicion flashing beneath her cool demeanor. Of course, Sadie’s probing gaze didn’t escape Hurst’s notice.

###Chapter 1258:
Unbothered, he greeted her stare with playful defiance, the faintest smirk tugging at his lips as he asked mockingly, “What’s wrong, Ms. Hudson—do I still make you uneasy?”
Sadie held back her reply, shifting her attention to Tina. Tina lowered her eyes guiltily, murmuring hesitantly, “Sadie, I wanted Dr. Lawson to take a quick look at Mr. Castro.”
She knew it wasn’t the best time to trouble Sadie with this, but she genuinely had no alternatives left.
Sadie’s guarded expression softened noticeably as she took in Tina’s quiet plea. She nodded, granting her approval. “Go ahead.”
Her gaze slid back to Hurst, sharpening once more. “We’ll need to talk afterward—in private.”
Hurst’s brow arched with mild intrigue. Clearly, Tina had informed Sadie about his recent interest in the NE Research Institute. Not that he particularly cared. In fact, it might be helpful to have Sadie’s insight directly. Maybe she’d even shed some real light on his questions.
“Fine by me,” he replied, his voice effortlessly indifferent.
With a final glance, he turned and followed Tina into Blaine’s room.
Sadie stayed rooted to the spot, eyes fixed thoughtfully on the now-closed door. Her elegant brows drew together, and she was deep in contemplation. Hurst was only in his early twenties. When authorities had forcibly disbanded the NE Research Institute, he would’ve still been a young child. How had he come across its history? And why was he now so keenly interested? What exactly was he hiding beneath that casual facade?
An uneasy intuition told Sadie that Hurst carried secrets far deeper than she’d imagined. As her mind raced through possibilities, the echo of frantic footsteps approached swiftly from down the corridor. A nurse hurried toward Sadie, clearly breathless and tense, urgently calling, “Ms. Hudson! Ms. Hudson! Mr. Wall—he’s awake!”
The sudden announcement hit Sadie like an electric shock. For a moment, her entire body stilled in stunned disbelief, and then her usually composed eyes lit up with an unmistakable spark of exhilaration. Without wasting another breath, Sadie turned around sharply, striding decisively toward Noah’s VIP hospital room.noveldrama
Hurst followed Tina into another ICU room, his footsteps quiet against the sterile floor. This room mirrored the layout of Noah’s previous quarters, though the space was slightly smaller. Blaine lay motionless on the hospital bed, his complexion carrying that sickly pallor unique to those who had spent countless days away from sunlight. Medical equipment surrounded him like silent guardians, their rhythmic beeping the only sign of life in the sterile chamber.
Lenny stood beside the bed, a man in his forties whose white coat and surgical mask couldn’t hide the deep furrows creasing his brow. Every line of his posture spoke of intense focus as he monitored his patient’s condition. The sound of approaching footsteps made him glance toward the entrance.
?tst chptrs in glnoνels.
Tina stepped through the doorway first, followed by Hurst, whose hands remained casually tucked in his pockets. His relaxed demeanor and distinctly unprofessional air immediately set Lenny’s nerves on edge. Something cold twisted in his stomach. Why would Tina bring a stranger here? Worse yet, why someone who looked so utterly unreliable?
.
.
.
###Chapter 1259:
“Ms. Delgado, who’s this gentleman?” Lenny cleared his throat, his voice carrying barely concealed wariness.noveldrama
Tina moved swiftly to Blaine’s bedside, worry etching itself across her features as she studied his pale form. Several heartbeats passed before she raised her eyes to meet Lenny’s gaze. “Dr. Holland, meet Dr. Lawson. Ms. Hudson personally arranged for his consultation on Mr. Castro’s case.”
Sadie had personally arranged this? Blood drained from Lenny’s face as his heart hammered against his ribs. What could have prompted Sadie to suddenly involve an outside physician? Had she discovered something? Fighting to suppress the panic threatening to overwhelm him, Lenny put on a brittle smile and stepped forward.
“Ms. Delgado, I’m afraid this arrangement seems rather irregular, wouldn’t you agree? Mr. Castro’s condition has stabilized under our current care, and our treatment protocol has shown consistent results throughout.”
His stay. Introducing an external consultant without proper hospital coordination could create complications…” His voice trailed off as cold sweat beaded along his spine. Under no circumstances could he allow anyone to examine Blaine thoroughly. Discovery would destroy everything. Years of his painstaking efforts could crumble in an instant.
Tina had already picked up on his obvious anxiety and defensive posturing. Doubt flickered through her mind briefly, but memories of Sadie’s clear instructions and Hurst’s almost miraculous treatment of Noah steadied her resolve. “Dr. Holland, there’s really no need for concern. Dr. Lawson is simply here for a consultation. His assessment won’t disrupt any of your ongoing treatments. Besides, this request comes from us, the patient’s family.”
Hurst remained silent throughout their tense exchange, his sharp eyes drinking in every detail. First, he studied Blaine’s motionless form on the hospital bed, then his gaze shifted to Lenny’s barely contained panic. Things were about to get very interesting indeed.
Hurst crossed the room with confident strides, paying no attention to the murderous look Lenny was drilling into his back. He studied the monitor readings with casual interest before lifting Blaine’s eyelids for a brief inspection. His fingers found the patient’s wrist first, then moved to check the pulse point along his neck.
Every movement appeared relaxed and unhurried, yet there was an unmistakable precision to his examination that spoke of genuine expertise. Sweat began forming along Lenny’s hairline as he watched from the sidelines. His pulse thundered so loudly he was certain everyone could hear it. Each breath came shallow and strained as he watched Hurst’s deceptively casual inspection, dreading the moment something might be discovered.
Just who was this man? What kind of doctor used such unorthodox examination techniques? Silent prayers ran through Lenny’s mind, as he begged that Hurst would find nothing suspicious.
Every chapter lives on g a lno vels ; comm
Suddenly, Hurst’s fingers stilled against Blaine’s throat, and his eyebrows rose just a fraction. He pulled his hand back and let his eyes drift around the sterile room until they settled on a pack of acupuncture needles resting on a nearby medical cart.
Without hesitation, he reached for one of the thin silver needles and began twirling it between his fingers with practiced ease. The needle danced in his grip, spinning with fluid precision that made it seem almost enchanted.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1260:
Lenny’s eyes widened in horror as panic seized his voice. “Wait… what are you planning to do?!”
If Hurst had randomly plunged that needle, who would shoulder the blame once Blaine’s situation got worse?
Yet Hurst remained utterly unbothered. Gripping the glinting needle, he pinpointed a location just behind Blaine’s lobe with surgical precision. With a sharp twist of his fingers, the needle embedded itself swiftly and flawlessly into the targeted spot.
“Ah!” A sudden gasp escaped from the figure on the hospital mattress. Blaine, who moments before resembled a corpse, suddenly tightened his brow, a grimace crossing his face as though weathering invisible torment. Then, beneath Tina’s and Lenny’s stunned stares, Blaine’s eyelids began to lift — unhurried but unmistakable.
Lenny stood frozen, mind wiped clean. Just a single motion… and the man had stirred. Could this be real? Lenny was sure it defied reason. Dread washed over him, but years of managing emergencies taught him to mask his emotions fast.
He stretched his lips into a strained grin, his voice shaking faintly. “He woke up! Mr. Castro woke up!”
Lenny spun toward Hurst. His expression was conflicted, but awe laced his words. “Dr. Lawson… what you’ve done is unbelievable! A complete phenomenon!” Lenny couldn’t afford to slip. His composure needed to stay flawless.
Hurst retrieved the needle and casually dropped it back on the tray. Glancing sideways at Lenny’s theatrical display, he let out a cryptic smirk. Then, turning smoothly to Tina, he arched a brow. “Well? Impressed now? I charge what I’m worth—fair enough, right?”
Tina, however, wasn’t listening. Her eyes were glued to the man who had just awakened. Tears brimmed instantly as she bent closer, voice trembling with disbelief. “You’re really awake? How do you feel? Can you speak?”
Blaine’s eyes drifted toward her, catching her delighted expression.
He lifted the edge of his lips into a crooked grin, playful yet faint from exhaustion. His throat rasped as he spoke. “Tina… where… where am I?”
He tried to shift, but his limbs protested, rigid and sore like rusted machinery. “Feels like I got steamrolled. Did you sneak in a few punches while I was out?” That familiar teasing tone nearly made Tina cry harder, equal parts irritation and relief washing over her.

Of all times, he still had the energy to joke.noveldrama
Still sobbing, she gently tapped his shoulder, barely making contact. “Seriously? I wouldn’t even waste the effort! You’ve been out forever—you scared the hell out of me!”
Blaine suddenly broke into a violent coughing fit, each hack more intense than the last. His complexion flushed deeply, and he weakly reached toward her for support.
Tina stared at her own hand, stunned. She’d barely touched him. No pressure at all. How could he react like that? Alarm surged through her chest. Her voice cracked. “Dr. Lawson! Please! Something’s wrong again!”
Hurst, observing from nearby, nearly choked on a laugh. In all his days, he’d never seen anything this ridiculous. He threw up his hands. “I’m done. Goodbye.” And with that, he spun around and started to leave.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1261:
But as he reached Lenny—still standing in place like a statue—he paused. As though recalling something amusing, he turned and gave Lenny a look dripping with irony. Then, clapping a hand on his shoulder, he quipped, “Dude, being the third wheel sucks, doesn’t it? C’mon, let’s bounce.”
Before Lenny could process it, Hurst dragged him away without ceremony.
Tina, still stunned, instinctively turned back toward the bed. Blaine no longer looked the slightest bit frail.
He now sat upright, his back against the pillows, a sly glint in his eye. A smirk curled his lips as he said, “You’re still just as easy to fool, you know.”noveldrama
Tina’s breath hitched, her face flushing bright red. “You… you absolute jerk! You had me worried sick! Maybe you should’ve stayed in a coma!”
Tina’s frustration nearly boiled over—she could have screamed from sheer exasperation.
With a sharp stomp, she spun on her heel, determined to storm out. But before she could take another step, Blaine called out, “Wait! Don’t leave!” He scrambled off the bed in a panic and caught hold of her wrist.
His movements were too fast.
A sharp gasp escaped him, pain flickering across his face as he clutched his arm.
From the way his brows drew together, it looked like he’d genuinely hurt himself this time. Tina halted mid-stride.
After being deceived just a minute ago, she wasn’t so quick to believe anymore. Her eyes narrowed, suspicion written all over her face.
Was Blaine putting on another act?
Blaine met her skeptical gaze, letting out a long, dramatic sigh. “You heartless woman. Never mind. I’m done playing games with you.” As he rubbed his sore arm, his mood shifted, growing more serious by the second.
“So, tell me—what’s happening out there? How long was I out for?” Tina could tell from his discomfort that this wasn’t an act. Her irritation faded, replaced by concern.
She settled beside the bed, her tone turning grave. “You had a severe allergic reaction to iodine. You’ve been unconscious for almost two weeks.”
Patiently, Tina explained everything that had unfolded while he was out—from the weeks he’d spent in a coma, to Sadie dealing with the shareholders of Wall Group, even earning the service of Hurst, that enigmatic doctor with a questionable sense of right and wrong.

Tina then laid out Wall Group’s current troubles, not forgetting to mention the phone that Alex had returned to Sadie, along with the explosive text message hidden within.
At first, Blaine listened quietly, nodding along to show he was following.
But as soon as the phone and its mysterious message came up, the relaxed look on his face disappeared.
He sat bolt upright, eyes narrowing with sudden intensity. “A text message? What did it say?”
Tina hesitated, suspicion creeping into her expression.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1262:
She double-checked the room to make sure no one else was listening in, then leaned closer, her voice barely above a whisper. “It… it says that Mr. Wall sent Jack to rescue Hailey.”
Blaine’s eyes went wide, shock etched across his features. It was as if she’d just told him the world had flipped upside down.
“That’s impossible!” The words shot out before he could stop them, so loud that Tina jumped in her seat.
She agreed—she couldn’t imagine Mr. Wall being that sort of person.
But how else could they explain the message on the phone?
Was someone trying to frame him?
Realizing he’d lost his composure, Blaine quickly tried to pull himself together.
He reached out and gripped Tina’s arm, urgency etched in every line of his face. “Tina, you need to hear this.” His voice was steady but intense. “Before I blacked out, I actually saw part of that text message. Everything was chaos, and the phone was already smashed, screen cracked—but I could still make out the last few words.”
He paused, letting each syllable land with weight. ” …points to Alex.”
Those words struck Tina like a jolt of electricity. She went rigid, every muscle frozen in disbelief.
Her hands shook so badly she knocked over the treatment tray, the metal clattering sharply against the stillness of the hospital room.
This couldn’t be real.
Alex, who’d always watched over Sadie, who treated her with nothing but care—how could he possibly have a hand in something so underhanded?
Tina’s voice quavered, her whole body trembling. “You… you must be mistaken, right? Maybe you misread it?”
Blaine shook his head, adamant. “No. That’s not possible.” He couldn’t bring himself to accept it.
But what Tina had just described didn’t match the bit he’d seen himself.
The details clashed completely.
g?lnσν?sоm hosts thrilling adventures
Where had the truth gotten lost?
A new sharpness crept into Blaine’s eyes. “Think carefully. Did anything strange happen while the phone was being repaired? Did Alex get involved at any stage?”noveldrama
Tina was caught off guard by the sudden seriousness in Blaine’s voice.
She could sense it—he was starting to suspect Alex.
But Alex? That just didn’t seem possible.
A frown creased her forehead as she forced herself to retrace her steps, playing the events over in her mind.
The more she thought about it, the more little details started to stand out.
“That day, your bodyguard found me and told me the phone was fixed, so I went to the shop to pick it up. He said some strange things, now that I think about it, but at the time, I brushed it off. As soon as I stepped out of the shop, phone in hand, I ran into Alex.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1263:
Tina’s words tumbled out faster now. “Alex explained that he’d helped you take the phone for repairs, so he just stopped by to check on it. Seemed logical enough at the time. But then I got an urgent call from work—something needed my attention right away. You remember how hectic things were back then. I couldn’t waste a second. Alex offered to take the phone to Sadie for me, since I had to attend to something else.”
By the end of her explanation, Tina couldn’t help but feel uneasy. The whole thing felt too perfectly timed.
Blaine’s mood shifted instantly, his expression darkening.
So it really was Alex behind it all.
Alex had always seemed so charming, so thoughtful with Sadie, like he was incapable of anything cruel.
But now, Blaine could see the truth—a wolf in gentleman’s clothing. “Alex… he’s fooled us all. Who would’ve guessed—”
“Hold on!”
Tina shot her hand up without warning, halting Blaine mid-sentence.
The blood drained from her face in slow, unsettling waves. “We don’t have anything solid,” she said, her voice thin. “Right now, it’s all hunches and eerie coincidences. Sadie won’t believe it.” She hesitated, a quiver of dread sneaking into her tone. “And if it is Alex… then this coma of yours…”
A horrifying idea burst to life in Tina’s mind, spreading like frostbite through her veins. Her skin turned clammy, her hands slick with sudden sweat.
If Alex truly had a hand in this… was it possible he had orchestrated Blaine’s coma, too?
Blaine caught the shift in her expression—something in her eyes gave it all away. “You said I went under because of an iodine allergy, didn’t you?”
Tina nodded stiffly, the words snagged in her throat.
A cold, knowing smirk crept across Blaine’s lips. “The Castro family’s hospital—famed for its flawless reputation—can’t even catch something as basic as a patient’s drug allergy?” Blaine’s voice was cold, laced with contempt. “Looks like this hospital isn’t as innocent as it seems.”
The conviction in his words hit Tina like a weight to the chest.

This hospital, under the ironclad control and lavish funding of the Castros, was supposed to represent the pinnacle of medical care. Mistakes like this simply didn’t happen. Not unless… they were intentional.
A flash of clarity sparked in Tina’s mind. “Hurst!” she blurted. “He just left with that doctor—Lenny.”
A heavy sense of dread swelled inside her.
She remembered rushing into Blaine’s room the last time his condition had taken a dangerous turn.
Lenny had been there—shifty, pale, fumbling through excuses. She hadn’t thought much of it then, but now, everything about him reeked of guilt.
And an iodine allergy? That alone couldn’t have plunged Blaine into such a prolonged, life-threatening coma.

###Chapter 1264:
It didn’t add up.
She turned to Blaine, their eyes locking—both of them thinking the same terrifying thought.
“I’ll go find out!” Tina couldn’t sit still for another second.
She sprang from her seat and bolted out of the room, her heart pounding like it might crack her ribs.noveldrama
She prayed for her intuition to be wrong.
Her shoes echoed sharply down the corridor as she darted left and right, looking for any trace of Hurst or Lenny.
But the floor was deserted—eerily so.
Just as her panic was about to consume her, the fire escape door groaned open with a metallic screech.
Hurst emerged with maddening nonchalance, one hand deep in his coat pocket, his face etched with irritation rather than surprise.
Tina’s breath caught. She rushed to him.
“Dr. Lawson!” She stood in his way, urgency crackling in her voice. “Where’s Dr. Holland? Where did he go?”
Hurst gave her a long, unreadable look, as though debating whether to pity her or scorn her.
She really had no idea. In his mind, he wasn’t just saving lives—he was babysitting fools.
And now, Tina was demanding answers she wouldn’t know what to do with even if he handed them to her on a silver tray. He sighed, shaking his head slightly.
“He’s dead,” Hurst said flatly, nodding toward the fire escape with a lazy flick of his hand. “He tried to run. Slipped on the stairs. Broke his neck. He’s down there now.”
A sharp jolt of dread stabbed through Tina’s chest.
Lenny… dead?
She hurried to the fire escape and pushed the door open. The dim lighting cast long shadows down the stairwell—at the very bottom, she spotted a still form crumpled in darkness.
Read it first on g?lno?els.c?m
A wave of cold swept through her, leaving her rooted in place.
Damn it.
With Lenny gone, their only chance at a direct confession vanished with him.
No more testimony. No more concrete evidence to reveal who had orchestrated everything behind the scenes.
But Alex’s name throbbed like a drumbeat in Tina’s mind.
No. Something about this felt too convenient, too neat.
Snapping back into focus, she steeled herself.
She couldn’t let up now.
If Lenny had truly been acting on Alex’s orders, there had to be a trail—money, favors, some hidden transaction that connected them.
If she could follow that thread, it might just lead to the truth.

###Chapter 1265:
She was already turning to leave, her mind racing through the steps of a full-blown investigation—but then, she stopped cold. Her face tightened with sudden anxiety as she spun back toward Hurst. “Lenny hurt Blaine earlier… Could there be any lasting damage?” Blaine had already been unconscious far too long. The thought of what might be lurking in his system terrified her.
Hurst looked at her closely, exhaling a weary sigh.
Sadie’s people—always storming into things, stirring chaos wherever they went.
But, at least this one knew where to direct her fear.
With an air of nonchalance, Hurst replied, “There’s nothing to worry about. That doctor lacked the nerve for anything truly reckless. Blaine’s allergic shock wasn’t severe—just some surface wounds and a minor reaction to the medication. The reason for his extended coma? Someone’s been slipping him small amounts of sedatives for a while. Give him a couple of days to clear the medication from his system, and he’ll bounce back. He’ll be running laps around you soon, I guarantee it.”
Those reassuring words chased away the last of Tina’s anxiety. A long breath escaped her, the tension in her shoulders melting away. “If you’re done with questions, I’ll get going now.”
Seeing her calm down, Hurst barely concealed his impatience, waving her off. Nothing mattered more to him at that moment than making his exit.
“Don’t bother me unless it’s urgent. I’ve got too much to do, and I need a break.”
He stressed that final word, just to make sure she wouldn’t miss his point.
Without waiting for a response, Hurst spun on his heel and strode out, never glancing back.
Tina clamped her lips shut, refusing to let irritation get the better of her.
His attitude might set her teeth on edge, but even she couldn’t deny that his expertise was unrivaled.
Without another glance, she turned to leave.
Finding out what tied Lenny to Alex took priority now, and nothing would sidetrack her.

Determination steeled her features as she marched for the elevator.
Meanwhile, in the sanctuary of Noah’s private room, Sadie kept a silent vigil at his bedside, watching as color slowly crept back into his cheeks.
Though he remained pale, a flicker of life returned to his dark, watchful eyes.
Sweat dampened Sadie’s tightly interlaced fingers, nerves on edge. Even with Noah awake at last, a heavy dread still clung to her chest, refusing to let go.
The doctor, after one last check, straightened with an air of excitement and delivered the news. “Unbelievable! This truly borders on miraculous. Mr. Wall has pulled through—he’s no longer in immediate danger.”noveldrama
Relief nearly buckled Sadie’s knees, tension melting away in an instant.
Catching herself against the side of the bed, she managed to remain standing.
What could be more welcome than news like this?
Noah was truly out of danger at last.

###Chapter 1266:
“Ms. Hudson, that Dr. Lawson you brought—he’s something else. We’re talking about a once-in-a-lifetime talent,” the doctor said, admiration written all over his face.
He couldn’t hide his awe, rubbing his palms together as he went on, “The method he used is ancient—drawing blood from precise acupuncture points with uncanny accuracy. The risks are immense; one slip, and the consequences could be dire. Hardly any doctor would even dare to attempt it, let alone pull it off.” His tone turned serious, his voice dropping a notch.
“After the surgery, curiosity got the better of me. I called my mentor—he’s a real authority in rare medical procedures. He told me this specialized needle technique was once the crown jewel of the NE Research Institute’s clinic in Zupren, designed for the most critical brain hemorrhage emergencies. But after the Institute’s sudden, mysterious closure, that technique vanished from practice. No one’s seen it in use for ages.”
The mention of the NE Research Institute struck Sadie like a hidden blade, slicing right to the core.
All color left her face.
The NE Research Institute again.
Why would Hurst know a method lost to the world, secreted away with the NE Research Institute’s demise?
Was it truly random that he knew so much and brought up the NE Research Institute as a deciding factor in life-and-death moments? Or was there a purpose to his every move?
Who exactly was he?
Sadie battled to hide the turmoil inside her, keeping her features composed.
“Thank you, doctor. I’m grateful for everything you’ve done.”
“It’s my pleasure, Ms. Hudson. Just part of the job,” the doctor replied, clearly still caught up in admiration for Hurst’s medical brilliance.
With a pleasant wave and a friendly smile, the doctor added, “I’ll leave you two alone. Mr. Wall’s only just woken up, so he needs plenty of rest. If anything changes, just hit the call button.”

He offered a respectful nod and let himself out, shutting the door with a gentle click.
Silence filled the room in his wake.
Sadie settled into the chair at Noah’s bedside, her eyes tracing the lines of his still-pale features.
Even in the midst of so much chaos, a bit of fortune had found its way to them—Noah was safe.
The quiet didn’t last. A faint creak at the doorway cut through the hush.
Both Sadie and Noah turned simultaneously.
Framed in the doorway, Hurst appeared.
With an easy swagger, Hurst sauntered into the room, hands sunk deep in his pockets, his pace as unhurried as ever.
.

.
###Chapter 1267:
Any trace of softness vanished from Sadie’s face as she fixed him with a cold stare. “What’s Blaine’s status now?”
Hurst barely bothered to lift his eyes, delivering his answer with a careless drawl. “He’s still breathing. That’s all you need to know.” A slight pause, then a ghost of a smile played at his lips. “Ms. Hudson, isn’t it about time we started being honest with each other?” There was no doubt what he meant.
He wanted to talk about the NE Research Institute.
Tension coiled in Sadie’s chest once more.
“You’ve played things close to the vest, Dr. Lawson. That needle technique is no ordinary skill. Only those tied to the NE Research Institute would ever know it.”
Her expression hardened, every word razor-sharp. “What’s your real link to NE?”
Noah’s thin hand clamped suddenly around Sadie’s, holding tight. A sharp glint flashed in Noah’s eyes as he shot Hurst a silent, unmistakable warning.
He could not allow Sadie to dig any deeper.
No matter what, she had to be kept far from the truth.
There was simply too much danger in what lay behind them.
If Sadie were ever pulled into that shadowy past, the fallout would be catastrophic.
With a strained gentleness, Noah tried to steer her away. “Sadie, some things are best left behind. Why keep chasing what’s already gone?”
None of it made sense to Sadie.
She honestly couldn’t understand.
Why did Noah always insist she turn her back on the questions about her parents’ vanishing?
For seventeen long years, she had lived every day and night longing for answers—hoping, aching.
Their fate was a gaping wound, neither alive nor dead in the world’s eyes.
How could he possibly expect her to just forget?
Hurst cast Noah a sideways glance, his smile edged with meaning. “Mr. Wall, you’re worried, aren’t you? Afraid that if the wrong people notice Ms. Hudson, she could be in danger?”

Noah tilted his head up, a storm of fury igniting in his gaze. “That’s enough!”
Unbothered, Hurst only shrugged, his smirk cutting sharper. “You know as well as I do—those people have eyes everywhere. Ms. Hudson’s mother, Brenda, played a pivotal role at the NE Research Institute. The truth will surface sooner or later. There’s no covering it up forever.”
Those people? Who exactly was he talking about? A cold weight settled in Sadie’s chest as Hurst’s words echoed in her mind.noveldrama
She darted a look at Noah, whose face had drained of all color, then back to Hurst, who revealed nothing.
Every instinct screamed at her that something dangerous and long-buried was at play.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1268:
“Who are you talking about? Who are they?” she asked.
Noah’s eyes dropped, his lashes throwing deep shadows over his face, gloom etched in every line.
Hurst’s warning rang with uncomfortable truth.
No one understood better than Noah just how far those people would go.
Should they ever target Sadie, she would never know another moment of calm.
No matter what, Noah could not allow her to be pulled into the bitter legacies and hidden wars of the past.
His only wish was to protect her, to give her a chance at a safe, joyful, and unburdened life.
Drawing a step closer, Hurst leaned in, his voice low. “Ms. Hudson, have you ever heard of an organization named Wolfpack?”
The mention brought Sadie to a standstill.
Notorious on the international stage, the Wolfpack was a black-market powerhouse, hunted across continents.
No founder had ever been unmasked. Its home base remained a mystery.
Every kind of illegal operation seemed to trace back to them, each one draped in secrecy.
Though she’d heard whispers about Wolfpack, Sadie had never imagined she’d hear the name spoken here—least of all by Hurst. Could there be a link between the NE Research Institute and this shadowy syndicate?
She found herself glancing at Hurst, searching for a clue.
Hurst said nothing more, yet the sly curve of his lips and the unfathomable depth in his gaze said everything she needed to know. A fresh wave of dread swept through Sadie, each new revelation weighing her down.
Her eyes flicked to Noah, searching his face for answers.
Every line of worry and hesitation carved into his expression gave him away—he’d carried this knowledge from the start.noveldrama
So, all this time, he’d kept her in the dark to shield her from Wolfpack’s reach?
Your imagination thrives at puntocom
Noah caught the storm of realization in her eyes and exhaled, long and weary.
Nothing was left to conceal now; the secrets had run out.
When he finally spoke, his voice scraped low and raw, heavy with the burden of confession. “Sadie, your parents stayed away for a reason. They vanished and lived in hiding—all of it was for your safety.”
Sadie jerked her head in denial, blinking hard as her eyes welled with tears.
She refused to accept that explanation.
No reassurance, no gentle words could sway her now.
Until the truth of her parents’ fate was laid bare, her soul would never be at rest.
She resolved in that moment to chase down the answers herself, for their sake and her own.
An unwavering resolve shone in Sadie’s eyes, making it clear to Noah that no argument would sway her.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1269:
With resignation, he let out another sigh, his words growing gentler. “Sadie, just take a breath. I’ll lay everything out for you.”
A beat passed as his gaze sharpened, this time landing squarely on Hurst, who hovered in the background like a shadow. “But before any of that, I need answers from you. Who are you, really?”
The direct question snapped Sadie out of her single-minded pursuit. Of course. Ever since Hurst entered their lives, nothing about him had felt normal.
She thought of his fixation with the NE Research Institute, those rare healing skills, and the nearly lost needle techniques. Every clue pointed to a life lived outside the ordinary.
Hurst’s lips quirked in a slight smile as he caught Noah’s suspicion, though his gaze stayed as cold as winter glass. “You can both relax. I’m not your enemy. If I were, Mr. Wall, you wouldn’t have made it this far. And you, Ms. Hudson—you’d hardly be standing here unharmed, would you?”
His words rang out steady and unflinching.
A long silence hung between them as Sadie sized up the man in front of her.
Despite Hurst’s irreverent demeanor and maddening way with words, she found no real motive for him to lie—especially when it came to saving lives.
She turned to Noah, giving him a slight nod, a silent message that she believed Hurst could be trusted.noveldrama
A hint of relief passed over Noah’s features.
Heavy with everything he was about to share, Noah looked back at Sadie.
“This story comes in fragments—most of what I know has come through bits Ralph has shared. Seventeen years ago, your mother, Brenda, was a leading scientist at the NE Research Institute,” Noah said, his tone low and grave. “At that point, the research your mother spearheaded led to breakthroughs that shook the scientific world. Unfortunately, the very nature of her project—dangerous molecular structures intended for human application—drew the attention of Wolfpack, a global syndicate operating in the black market’s shadows. Nothing about that group is ordinary. Wolfpack is ruthless, everywhere at once, and will cross any line…”
To get what they want. Since then, they’ve never stopped trying to track your mother down. Remember the empty grave you found? There’s a reason for that. Wolfpack almost certainly took your parents’ ashes, either to confirm their identities or to lure out someone they wanted. If word ever reaches Wolfpack that Brenda has a daughter—if they discover you exist—they’ll come after you, Sadie. They’ll hunt you, no matter the cost.” Noah’s voice grew heavier with each sentence, the truth pounding into Sadie’s chest with the force of a hammer.
“Sadie, sending Sharon away was the only way to protect you, to make sure you’d never be caught up in this nightmare,” Noah continued, his voice trembling with regret. “As for the blaze at Faron Estate five years ago… that day, the person your mother met with was Ralph. She must have sensed danger closing in and made Ralph promise to look out for you, no matter what. But shortly after their meeting, the fire swept through the estate. It moved so fast there was no chance to save anyone. That’s all I know.”
Noah’s revelation left Sadie feeling hollow, as if her bones had turned to water. The world seemed to tilt, vision swimming in and out of focus.

###Chapter 1270:
Chaos roared through her thoughts.
So this was it—the truth behind her parents’ disappearance and the tragedy that destroyed her family. The Wolfpack had hunted them, driven them to ruin.
All of it, every loss and every heartbreak, traced back to Wolfpack’s shadow.
Rage exploded inside her, fierce and overwhelming.
Fingernails bit into her palms as she balled her hands into fists. Without warning, she pivoted sharply, her steps urgent as she made for the door.
Answers were out there—she was done waiting.
She would dig up every secret and tear the truth from the Wolfpack’s grasp, no matter what it took.
“Bang!”
Right as Sadie was about to storm out, a blur of motion cut across her path.
In an instant, Hurst appeared, his reflexes almost inhuman, blocking her exit and striking a precise spot at the nape of her neck.
Darkness swallowed her vision, her limbs turning to water as she slumped forward.
“No—Sadie!” Noah’s face drained of color, panic ripping through his voice as he struggled to rise, held back by the pain in his battered body. Before Sadie could hit the floor, Hurst’s arms darted out, catching her with surprising gentleness.
“What are you doing?!” Noah’s voice trembled. He was torn between fury and fear.
Carefully, Hurst eased Sadie onto the nearest hospital bed, handling her as though she might break.
With his usual careless air, he shrugged. “What did you expect me to do? Let her march out and face Wolfpack by herself? That’s suicide, and you know it. No one’s more stubborn than Sadie, and you of all people know that, Mr. Wall.”
At that, Noah found himself without a retort, anger slowly giving way to resignation.
Letting his worries get the better of him had clouded Noah’s thinking.
Deep down, he recognized that Hurst was right.
Given Sadie’s relentless drive, nothing would stop her now that she knew the truth.

Yet the Wolfpack was nothing short of a den of predators, and confronting them alone would be signing her own death sentence.
Noah’s former silence had stemmed from one fear: this exact moment, when Sadie’s need for answers would outweigh caution.
Now, though, it was obvious—there were secrets you couldn’t bury forever.
Still, Noah reached a decision in his heart.
No force on earth would make Sadie give up on her parents’ story, no matter the risk.
If that was how it had to be, then he’d stand with her.
Whatever it took, he’d help her tear the Wolfpack out by the roots and see them destroyed.
Eyes narrowing with resolve, Noah fixed his gaze on Hurst.

###Chapter 1271:
The fire in his stare didn’t go unnoticed—Hurst caught it and smirked. “You realize, Mr. Wall, the Wolfpack didn’t earn their name for nothing. They’ve built an empire in the shadows. Bringing them down won’t be easy. If I’m not mistaken, you don’t even know where they’re holed up, do you?”
Though his words sounded offhand, there was an unmistakable edge to Hurst’s question.
Noah chose honesty over evasion. “You know where they are, don’t you? That’s what matters now.”
No sooner had Noah finished than Hurst’s curiosity ignited.
Dragging a chair over, Hurst settled in with a relaxed, almost smug confidence.
A faint grin played at his lips as he cut to the chase. “So, how did you figure it out?”
Noah glanced up, his quiet authority easily overshadowing Hurst’s laid-back arrogance.
Right after Ralph had briefed him on both the NE Research Institute and the Wolfpack, Noah had dispatched a team to dig deeper. It turned out that the same year the Hudson family crumbled and Sadie’s parents vanished, something else major had happened.noveldrama
The Lawson family, a heavyweight in global pharmaceuticals and a key backer of the NE Research Institute, lost its leadership in a bizarre incident.
Not long after, the once-mighty Lawson Group abruptly collapsed into bankruptcy.
Piece by piece, the clues came together. Hurst’s obsession with the NE Research Institute and his needle techniques both pointed in one direction.
“You’re from that famous Lawson family in Zupren, aren’t you?” Noah said quietly.
A soft chuckle escaped Hurst as he looked down.
When his gaze lifted again, there was a shadow of old pain in his eyes.
For once, Hurst truly hadn’t seen Noah’s insight coming.
He’d been just a boy when the Lawson family fell apart.
His older brother, Stuart, once the golden child of the family, had become a shattered version of himself, paranoid and lost, after the tragedy.
Hurst had spent years living under Stuart’s identity, forced to operate in his brother’s shadow, bearing burdens that never seemed to lighten.
“You’re right, Mr. Wall.”
Noah sat back, considering his next move in silence.
One thing was clear—Hurst carried a vendetta against the Wolfpack that ran deep.
That just might be the leverage they needed.
Noah cut straight to the heart of it. “What proof do you have tying the Wolfpack to the Lawson family’s collapse?”
Hurst let out a small sigh, his expression tinged with frustration. “I don’t have solid proof right now, just scattered clues that all point back to Brenda, once a core scientist at the NE Research Institute. I’ve spent years chasing her trail, and instead, I ended up finding her daughter.”
As those words left his mouth, his eyes drifted to the hospital bed, landing on Sadie’s unconscious form with a look that lingered.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1272:
Noah dropped his gaze, masking the anger that simmered beneath the surface.
The Wolfpack had left nothing but devastation in their wake, destroying even the Lawson family, one of the NE Research Institute’s biggest supporters.
If they ever learned Sadie was Brenda’s daughter, there was no telling what they’d do.
Noah couldn’t risk letting them get to her.
He looked up, resolve hardening in his eyes.
“If you’re after the Wolfpack too, why not join forces?” he suggested.
Interest flickered in Hurst’s gaze at Noah’s proposition. “I’m listening, Mr. Wall. What’s your plan?”
An hour later, Sadie slowly opened her eyes.
A dull pain throbbed at the back of her neck, making her wince instinctively.
Her memory scrambled to fill in the blanks before everything went dark.
And then it clicked! It was Hurst!
He’d struck her, knocking her out cold, just as her emotions were spiraling, catching her off guard while she was frantic to chase down the truth.
That jerk!
Sadie bolted upright, but the sudden motion sent a jolt of pain through her neck, making her gasp for air.noveldrama
A quick look around the room revealed she was alone. Noah and Hurst were nowhere to be seen.
Where had they disappeared to?
Leaning on the wall for support, Sadie forced herself upright and shuffled toward the door, her limbs still shaky.
Nervous energy raced through her veins.
Had they found something and decided to keep her in the dark? As she pulled the door open and started to step out, she bumped straight into someone’s chest, warm and unyielding.
I@?e$t ￠н@я$ ?η и?vε.c?m
Startled, Sadie stepped back, then looked up to see who it was. Noah stood in front of her, his complexion still a bit washed out, but his gaze focused and steady. No one else was there. Sadie saw only Noah.
She asked, “Where’s Hurst? Why isn’t he around?”
Noah reached out, brushing his hand softly against her cheek.
His touch radiated warmth, steadying her nerves.
“He’s gone. Sadie, just trust me. Give me a little time and I’ll handle everything, okay?”
Sadie opened her mouth, questions and anxieties swirling inside her. She wanted to ask about the Wolfpack, about Hurst, about the mystery surrounding her parents.
However, before she could utter a single word, Noah wrapped his arms around her, holding her close.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1273:
“Sadie, everything is finally falling into place now,” he said, his voice calm and reassuring. “I’d never ask you to walk away from this. But from here on out, if it’s about the Wolfpack, you’ll have to trust my lead.”
Every word carried quiet strength, settling deep inside her.
Pressed against his chest, Sadie could feel the steady, comforting thump of his heartbeat.
He understood. He knew the whole story now.
Gone was the man trying to protect her by keeping secrets. Now, he was choosing to face everything at her side.
Somehow, that trust made the anxiety in her chest loosen, at least a little.noveldrama
After a brief pause, Sadie finally whispered, “Okay.” Moments later, the hospital door swung open.
A bodyguard in a sharp black suit stepped in, carrying a container of food.
Sadie glanced behind him instinctively, her eyes searching for Tina. “Where’s Tina?” she asked.
The bodyguard bowed respectfully. “Ms. Delgado had a pressing matter and left to address it. She asked me to bring Mr. Wall his lunch.” Sadie offered a slight nod.
Tina never dropped the ball—if she walked away from something, there had to be a good reason behind it.
Over at the Wall Group headquarters, Tina sat amidst piles of documents, drowning in administrative demands.
Her desk phone kept ringing.
Then—bam—the door flew open.
A bodyguard stormed inside, clearly rattled. “Ms. Delgado, we reviewed Dr. Holland’s financial records—no irregularities. We also searched his residence but came up empty.”
Tina’s expression tightened, confusion swirling in her eyes.
None of this added up.
Your hub for updates: g?lnσνs?c?m
If Lenny had been manipulated by Alex and cash wasn’t the method, then what was?
Could Alex have held something over him?
But why would a regular physician be entangled in anything blackmail-worthy?
Something didn’t sit right.
Now that Blaine had awakened—though the news had been kept a secret—it was only a matter of time before word got out. If Alex caught wind of it, he’d likely react fast.
Perhaps it was smarter to go on the offensive.
This could also serve as a test.
Deep down, Tina resisted the idea that Alex could be the mastermind. In the last few years—particularly during the chaotic stretch when Sadie had just assumed leadership of Wall Group, wrestling with both discord from within and looming threats from the outside—Tina had observed, without filters, just how deeply Alex had stood by Sadie. Through every storm, he remained her unwavering anchor. Quietly, Tina had once found herself moved by him, believing Alex to be one of those rare men molded from loyalty and strength. She turned, her expression settling into its typical composure.

###Chapter 1274:
“Keep the news of Mr. Castro’s recovery under wraps for now,” she instructed evenly. “Public announcements should simply state that his status is gradually improving and he’s exhibiting stronger signs of mental clarity. Say he’s stable and likely to regain full awareness soon. Also, suppress any information about Dr. Holland’s abrupt and devastating demise. That must not leak under any circumstances. Place someone on continuous surveillance at Howe Group. Alert me the second Alex makes a move.”
The bodyguard’s demeanor was resolute. “Understood, Ms. Delgado.” With that, he pivoted and exited briskly.
The door had barely closed when it burst open once more.noveldrama
A second bodyguard rushed in, clearly more rattled than the last. “Ms. Delgado, we just got a message from the team tailing Malcolm. He’s… heading straight for Nirvana.”
Tina sprang from her seat, her gaze sharp as she absorbed the report.
Malcolm?
Why would he be sneaking toward Nirvana now?
Was it for a secret rendezvous?
“We’re heading there now! Oh, no. Hold on!” Tina suddenly stopped in her tracks.
Bringing a full squad would attract the wrong kind of attention and possibly tip off the other side.
If Alex was orchestrating something behind the scenes, his team would already be watching closely.
Biting down in hesitation, Tina deliberated only a moment before issuing orders with precision. “Two of you—change clothes, blend in, and trail me from a distance. Maintain a gap of five hundred yards. No closer. Everyone else remains on standby and awaits my signal.”
“Copy that, Ms. Delgado.”
Twenty minutes later, Tina arrived at Nirvana in a vehicle.
The moment she stepped out, her eyes swept the area with intent. Far ahead, she caught a glimpse of a figure skulking through shadows and slipping into a side entrance of a modest structure. It was Malcolm—no question about it.
Malcolm’s sneaky posture and the fading circle on his scalp—there was no way you couldn’t recognize him.
Find more content at ?σ.cоm
He was making his way toward the secluded suite section.
Tina’s eyes narrowed, and she hastened her steps, trailing behind at a cautious distance.
She was determined to uncover his current mischief.
Just as she neared the compact structure’s entrance and prepared to step inside, a waitress in a neatly tailored outfit intercepted her with a cheerful grin.
It was evident the woman knew Tina.
“Hello, Ms. Delgado! What an unexpected delight! Are you here to collect something for Ms. Hudson?” the waitress chirped.
Tina’s chest tightened.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1275:
She lifted one hand and gently placed a finger over her lips to hush the woman.
Her gaze darted upward, following the path Malcolm had taken moments before, ensuring no attention had been attracted before letting out a quiet sigh of relief.
What a close call. She had almost been exposed by this waitress.
“Please lower your voice,” Tina murmured smoothly, keeping her expression pleasant and unthreatening.
“Actually, Sadie sent me to reserve a private room for later. I was hoping to secure Suite 88. It’s quite popular for the stunning skyline view. Is it unclaimed?”
The waitress hesitated, clearly thrown off, before responding with a slight shake of her head and a troubled smile. “Oh, I hate to tell you this, Ms. Delgado, but that suite was just spoken for. Would you be open to checking out other premium rooms? A few also come with remarkable scenery.”
Tina’s brow creased as she feigned frustration. “Is that so?” she muttered, drawing out the words as though they tasted bitter. “But Sadie insisted on that specific room. She mentioned it multiple times—said she had dinner there with friends before and loved it. Is there any chance I could speak with whoever claimed it? Maybe they’d be willing to trade?”
Her words rang with sincerity, and her pleading expression added weight to her request.
The waitress, aware of Sadie’s elite status at Nirvana and not wanting to risk offense, grew uneasy.
Tina’s attitude didn’t feel pushy, just genuinely concerned.
After a brief moment of internal debate, the waitress leaned forward and whispered, “Please don’t mention this came from me… but I believe someone from Howe Group made the booking. I heard it’s for one of their executives.”
Tina’s eyes widened.
Alex?
Could this entire farce involving Malcolm and the shareholders be orchestrated by him?
But… why?
€$? ￠?€?$  glov?l?o
Wasn’t he supposed to care about Sadie?
Her thoughts raced as she recalled a vague memory—seeing Malcolm sneaking around here before.
Was that also a covert rendezvous with Alex?
Her stomach dropped.
“Ms. Delgado, are you okay?” the waitress asked, her voice filled with concern at Tina’s pale features.
Snapping out of her spiraling thoughts, Tina forced a tight smile. “I’m fine, thank you. You can go ahead—I’ll figure something out.”
Though puzzled, the waitress didn’t probe further and politely took her leave.
Tina gently pressed her teeth into her lower lip, collecting herself before proceeding silently toward Room 88.noveldrama
Her pulse quickened with each step.

###Chapter 1276:
She scanned the hallway. Deserted.
Once she ensured the coast was clear, she leaned close to the suite door, slightly turning her head to peer through the narrow opening.
The lighting inside was faint.
Alex lounged at the table, radiating cool dominance.
Across from him sat Malcolm—visibly unraveling. Sweat drenched his forehead, and his shirt was half undone. He clutched his hands together, eyes wild with dread.
“Mr. Howe, you have to help me! I did everything exactly as you instructed. And now Wall Group is threatening me with a lawsuit. They claim I’ve provoked internal conflict and are holding me accountable. What am I supposed to do now?” Malcolm’s voice cracked, nearly breaking.
Alex calmly drew in a breath of smoke, his gaze drifting lazily to the desperate man across from him.
“Mr. Pierce… did you already forget what we agreed upon?” Alex’s tone, icy and deliberate, sliced through the air. “I warned you clearly—whatever you do, keep Sadie out of it. You were free to stir the pot however you liked—as long as she remained untouched. But you didn’t listen. Now look where that’s gotten you. Frankly, you deserve everything that’s happening.”
Color drained from Malcolm’s cheeks.
Alex’s dispassionate reply confirmed he had no interest in bailing him out.
Malcolm’s stomach churned with fury. His lips curled into a snarl, and his hands clenched into fists. “We’re entangled in this together, Mr. Howe!” he growled. “Let me be absolutely clear—if you hang me out to dry, don’t expect me to stay quiet. I’ve got receipts. I’ll blow the lid off everything. Hailey’s secret child, your dirty tricks to ruin Noah… all of it. If I go down, I’ll make damn sure you’re crashing down with me.”
The moment Malcolm issued his threat, a chill swept through the air around Alex, as if the temperature had dropped with his mood. He rose slowly, each deliberate step forward echoing with quiet menace.
Gone was the warmth that usually lit his gaze—now, his eyes blazed with a sharp, unrelenting edge.
Malcolm’s bravado faltered. A tremor of unease passed through him, and he instinctively retreated a pace.
“W-What are you trying to do?” he stammered, his voice cracking under pressure. “I’m warning you—don’t do anything reckless! If anything happens to me, you’ll regret it!”

He stood his ground, but the wobble in his voice betrayed the fear clawing at him.
Alex was terrifying in his silence, the threat of action more potent than words.
For a moment, it looked like Alex might actually snap.
A low, bitter laugh slipped from his lips—humorless and cold. His eyes never softened. “Mr. Pierce,” he said calmly, “you’re making false accusations. But if there’s one thing I truly can’t stand… it’s being threatened.”
He raised a hand lazily, as though dismissing a fly.
The restroom door burst open without warning, and a line of towering bodyguards in black suits marched out, their faces emotionless as they closed in around Malcolm like a pack of wolves. Terror overtook him—his knees began to buckle.

###Chapter 1277:
Meanwhile, Alex strolled back to his seat with unbothered grace, picked up his coffee mug, and gave it a slow, thoughtful blow, as though nothing unusual were happening.
“Let’s help Mr. Pierce settle down,” he said smoothly. “He’s not getting any younger… perhaps a touch of senility is setting in.”
The words had barely left his mouth when the bodyguards sprang into action. One grabbed a plate of spicy chili-glazed chicken pieces, while another seized Malcolm by the jaw, forcing his mouth open.noveldrama
They forced the chicken pieces into his mouth and down his throat.
“Mmph! Mmph!” Malcolm thrashed, his arms flailing wildly, but it was like fighting shadows—his strength useless against the trained muscle holding him.
The spicy sauce burned down his throat like acid, tears springing to his eyes as he hacked and coughed, humiliated and broken.
Just outside the room, Tina stood frozen behind the slightly ajar door. Her eyes widened in horror, a hand clamping over her mouth to suppress the scream rising in her throat.
Was this really Alex? The man who always smiled politely, who treated Sadie with such tenderness—the man who once seemed the embodiment of charm and civility? Now, he looked like a demon cloaked in silk.
A cold shiver climbed up Tina’s spine, her palms slick with sweat.
He was brutal!
Tina forced herself to stay composed, even as her heart thundered in her chest.
She knew what she had to do.
With trembling fingers, she fumbled her phone out of her pocket, her mind screaming only one thing—get evidence.
She had to capture it. Alex’s true, terrifying self exposed.
Just as she raised her phone and tried to steady the shot, a sharp notification chime sliced through the silence.
Her stomach dropped.
Lɑt?st chαpt?rs n glov?.сm
She’d forgotten to silence her phone.
Inside the room, Alex froze.
His eyes snapped toward the door like a predator catching scent. And then—he caught Tina’s terrified eyes. His pupils narrowed into slits, cold and calculating. What the hell was Tina doing here?
Fear surged through Tina like a lightning bolt.
Acting on pure instinct, she jabbed at her phone screen, found Blaine’s chat, and sprinted down the corridor.
Behind her, Alex’s face twisted with fury. “Go! Bring her to me!” he snapped.
The bodyguards dropped the limp, gasping Malcolm like dead weight and charged after Tina.
Meanwhile, at the hospital, Blaine sat upright in bed, eyes locked on his phone screen, scrolling through unanswered messages. Still nothing from Tina.
His thumb hovered, then swiped to dial her number again.
.

.
###Chapter 1278:
The automated voice informed him that he had reached Tina’s voicemail.
Where was she? Why hadn’t she answered her phone?
A heavy knot of unease twisted in his chest.
Tina was steady and reliable. She wouldn’t just disappear like that. Not without a reason.
Tossing the covers aside, Blaine swung his legs over the edge of the bed and stood—when suddenly—Ding!
His phone lit up. A single message.
“Malcolm is at Nirvana…”
From Tina. Nothing more? That was too brief and too unsettling.
His heart skipped.
Frowning, he tapped to call her back, but she was still unreachable.
Something was wrong. He could feel it in his gut.noveldrama
Without another thought, Blaine strode to the door.
But just as he reached for the handle, a bodyguard stepped in, blocking his path.
“Sir, I’m sorry, but Ms. Delgado gave strict instructions. No one’s to know you’re awake. Please, you should rest…”
But Blaine wasn’t about to listen.
Grabbing the guard’s collar with a fist full of panic, he shouted, “Where the hell is Tina?”
The bodyguard flinched at Blaine’s sudden action, his voice trembling. “I—I’m not sure either. I just heard Ms. Delgado went out on business with a few bodyguards.”
Blaine’s fists clenched, his pulse racing. Something felt off.
Just then, hurried footsteps echoed from the far end of the corridor.
Another bodyguard stumbled over, his face pale and slick with sweat. “Mr. Castro, bad news!”
Blaine turned sharply. His voice was low and tight. “What is it?”
The man struggled to catch his breath. “It’s Ms. Delgado. She took a small team to Nirvana, said she needed to check something. We stayed outside on standby. She went in alone—but an hour passed, and she didn’t come out. When we asked around, the staff swore she was never there. But we saw her go in.”
Blaine froze. The words hit like a slap, their weight sinking deep. Tina had vanished?
No. That wasn’t possible. She wasn’t the type to make reckless moves, especially not with bodyguards nearby.
His mind raced back to her message. Malcolm. Nirvana.
His eyes darkened; something dangerous flickered in his gaze. “Why Nirvana? Why did she take you there?”
The bodyguard’s face drained of color as he quickly answered, “It was Malcolm! Ms. Delgado said his presence at Nirvana was suspicious.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1279:
Blaine felt a heavy drop in his chest.
Malcolm!
“What about now?” he asked. “Where’s Malcolm?”
“We don’t know,” the man said, shaking his head. “The staff claim they haven’t seen either of them.”
A chill ran down Blaine’s spine.
He stepped forward, ready to storm out, but the guard by the door moved to block him.
“Mr. Castro, please—don’t. Ms. Delgado made it clear that your recovery must stay hidden. If you show yourself now, everything she’s worked for will fall apart.”
The words struck home. Blaine stopped, teeth gritted. He knew the guard was right.noveldrama
But how could he think about any of that now?
His fists clenched, knuckles turning pale.
How could he stay put now?
Tina could already be in danger.
A sharp panic settled in his chest—unlike anything he’d ever felt before.
Only then did he realize just how deep his worry ran. This wasn’t just about a colleague. His concern for Tina had far surpassed what was expected of a boss.
At that moment, a sharp voice called out from the end of the corridor,
“What’s going on here? Blaine, what happened?” Sadie had heard the commotion and arrived quickly.
Blaine turned to her as if clinging to his last hope.
He rushed toward her, the usual teasing glint in his eyes gone. His voice trembled. “Sadie! Tina’s missing.”
Sadie’s eyes widened. Tina was missing?
How was that even possible?
galnσνels.c○m hosts fresh updates
Blaine and the bodyguard recounted everything in rapid detail. As the pieces fell into place—Malcolm, Nirvana, Alex—Sadie’s expression grew grave.
Each name carried weight. None of this was ordinary.
Sadie made her decision instantly. “Don’t panic. Stay here and wait for my update. I’ll take some people and check Nirvana myself.”
Blaine nodded quickly, still shaken.
In moments like this, Sadie was always the one to think clearly. He stood frozen as she gathered her team and left. Then, as if the last of his strength had drained out, he sank into a chair in the corridor.
His eyes dropped to the floor.
His thoughts raced, but his heart felt numb.
Tina was usually sharp and quick on her feet. Blaine could only hope she wouldn’t let her nerves get the best of her when it counted most. He kept reassuring himself that she’d be fine, silently repeating it over and over to drown out the creeping sense of dread.
.

###Chapter 1280:
Thirty minutes later, a convoy of sleek black cars glided to a halt in front of Nirvana.
Sadie stepped out, escorted by a dozen guards, each one moving with the confidence of someone who could handle trouble before it started. Inside, the lobby manager of Nirvana caught sight of the intimidating group, especially Sadie leading the way, and felt a jolt of panic shoot through him.
Not only was Sadie a VIP at Nirvana, but she also ran Wall Group, and nobody in their right mind would want to cross her.
Forcing a broad, anxious grin, the manager rushed over to greet her. “Ms. Hudson! What an honor to see you. Can I prepare a private room for you today?”
His heart was pounding in his chest. Sadie rarely showed up with more than a couple of assistants, but now she’d brought a whole battalion. They looked far too serious for a casual meal.noveldrama
Had Nirvana somehow offended her?
Sadie offered him a cool, unreadable look as she swept her gaze across the extravagant lobby. “One of my employees disappeared here. I’ve brought my people to help find her. I trust this won’t disrupt your business?”
Sadie’s tone was casual, but her authority was unmistakable.
The manager froze for a split second, then felt an unexpected wave of relief wash over him.
So she was only here to find someone? That was far less alarming than he’d feared.
His grin stretched wider as he bowed repeatedly. “Absolutely not, Ms. Hudson! We’re honored to assist in any way. Please, who should we be looking for? I’ll have my staff start searching immediately. Would you like to wait in the lounge while we conduct the search, Ms. Hudson?”
Nervous sweat prickled at his hairline. He couldn’t afford a single misstep with someone like her.
Sadie’s reputation clearly wasn’t exaggerated. Standing nearby, he felt the weight of her presence making the air thick.
With a nod, Sadie accepted his offer and settled onto a sofa in the lounge, uneasy despite her composed appearance.
Oddly, the manager’s eagerness to please only heightened her anxiety. Tina was never careless. How could she just vanish in a busy place like Nirvana?
I€$? ￠tя? ?η ga?n?νεl?.c
Every minute seemed to crawl, each one heavier than the last.
After twenty tense minutes, the head bodyguard hurried back, his face dark. “Ms. Hudson, we searched every corner. There’s no sign of Ms. Delgado anywhere.”
Sadie shot to her feet, her thoughts racing.
That couldn’t be right.
Nirvana wasn’t exactly a maze, yet after combing the place from top to bottom, they still couldn’t find Tina?
She fixed the quivering manager with a sharp look. “Show me your security footage. Pull it up now.”
Instantly, the manager’s forced smile faltered, and the nervous sweat on his brow only worsened.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1281:
He dabbed at his forehead, his voice shaky. “I… I’m truly sorry, Ms. Hudson. There’s been a problem with our surveillance system. It went down this morning. Maintenance is on it, but they say it’ll be at least two days before it’s up and running again.”
Malcolm had shown up suspiciously at Nirvana earlier, and now Tina was gone.noveldrama
Even the cameras had “conveniently” failed.
Too many ‘accidents’ piling up—Sadie wasn’t buying it.
She could sense that someone had carefully wiped away every clue, leaving nothing behind.
But who would go to such lengths? Was Alex involved—or was it someone else entirely?
Sadie refused to finish the thought, a cold shiver creeping up her spine and settling at the base of her neck.
Suddenly, a young server burst down the stairs, panic etched across her face.
“Sir, we have a problem. The cleaning lady found a woman’s and a man’s bodies in the river out back. The police are on their way!”
The news hit Sadie like a physical blow, leaving her stunned. For a moment, her knees buckled, and her world blurred at the edges.
A quick-thinking bodyguard caught her before she collapsed. “Ms. Hudson, are you okay?”
Sadie shook off his arm, her eyes burning, and raced toward the river without a backward glance.
No. It couldn’t be Tina.
It absolutely couldn’t be Tina.
A silent scream echoed inside her mind, drowning out reason, but the fear pressed down on her, refusing to let go.
Every fiber of her being prayed that her worst fears wouldn’t come true.
Bright yellow tape already wrapped the riverbank in a warning, making it impossible to miss the police presence.
g?lnσνs?c?m is packed with great reads
Humidity clung to everything, mingling with the unmistakable scent of fish and something less pleasant.
Arriving on the scene, Sadie spotted uniformed officers clustered at the water’s edge, their faces serious as they methodically went about their jobs. Each gesture they made showed extra caution, as if any mistake would matter too much.
Crowds of reporters hovered just beyond the barrier, their shouts and camera flashes punctuating the tension.
Sadie winced every time one of those harsh bursts of light caught her eyes.
A crowd blocked most of her view, but her focus remained fixed on one patch of riverbank that seemed to draw all attention.
A body was there.
Forcing her way past onlookers, Sadie nearly lost her balance in the mud, propelled by a desperate urgency.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1282:
Mud tried to drag her down, and her feet nearly slipped out from under her.
“Ms. Hudson!” The call came from her bodyguard, who hurried after her, arms outstretched to steady her.
Sadie refused to slow down or listen, driven by a need to see for herself.
Within moments, the scene came into focus.
Stretched out on the ground, a figure was hidden beneath a pristine white sheet.
That silhouette was heartbreakingly familiar, its outline slender and unmistakable.
Shock hit her so hard she could barely breathe.
Sadie’s eyes went wide with horror.
She reached forward, her hand shaking uncontrollably as dread filled her chest.
The sheet seemed impossibly heavy, resisting every ounce of her strength.
Somehow, she found the will to lift a corner of it, her breath caught in her throat.
Time itself felt suspended as she peeled the fabric away.
Beneath the cover, a face stared up—drained of color, unmoving. Those eyes, once so alive, remained closed forever, the spark completely gone.
Tiny beads of water still clung to those long lashes, sparkling in the faint light.
Recognition hit Sadie like a blow—Tina was right in front of her. It truly was Tina.
A wave of dizziness crashed over her, and a piercing ring filled her ears.
Backward steps came instinctively as her knees buckled, nearly sending her to the ground.
Nothing made sense—how could this be Tina?
Her mind rejected what her eyes insisted was true.
The young woman who once buzzed with energy, who tackled every task with cheerful efficiency, who stood by Sadie’s side through every storm—now lay silent, still, and cold as stone.noveldrama
Gone was the radiant smile. Gone was the gentle voice calling her name.
Every story starts at g?lnσν?s﹒оm
A piercing grief twisted deep inside Sadie’s chest.
Her lips quivered as she attempted to say Tina’s name, but no sound escaped.
Every breath felt strangled, her throat raw and aching.
Tears filled her eyes, making the world a blur, each drop stinging more than the last.
A hollow ache consumed her, a pain that left her gasping.
Questions spun in her head, desperate for answers.
Why was Tina here, like this? How did it come to this?
The reality felt impossible—how could Tina be gone?
Every part of her screamed in denial.
Nightmare or not, she dug her nails into her palms, hoping pain would snap her awake. No matter how hard she pressed, the sting in her hands only proved this was all too real.
.
.

###Chapter 1283:
Acceptance clawed its way in. This was happening. This was the brutal truth.
From somewhere behind, frantic voices started shouting along the riverbank.
“Over here, hurry!”
“Lift him out gently!”
Those urgent shouts slipped through the haze in Sadie’s mind, adding another layer of turmoil to her grief.
The mention of the second body sent a new wave of dread through her. Sadie’s head snapped up, her face streaked with tears and stunned disbelief.
Searching the riverside with stinging eyes, she tried to make sense of the scene.
A group of restaurant workers, sleeves rolled up, were hauling another lifeless figure from the freezing river.
What emerged this time was unmistakably a man.
Clothes plastered against his frame, he looked like he’d been battered by the current and the cold.
Every inch they dragged him closer to dry land, Sadie’s nerves frayed further.
Recognition came all at once—the mud-caked skin, the bloated face, and that familiar thinning hair left no room for doubt.
It was Malcolm.
Shock paralyzed Sadie. She stood rooted in place.
Disbelief widened her eyes; she couldn’t process what she was seeing.
Malcolm… gone as well?
He died with Tina in this river?
That idea was almost too much to accept.noveldrama
Thoughts whirled in Sadie’s head as she started to piece together the clues.
Malcolm had shown up at Nirvana, his movements suspicious. Worried he might be up to something that would threaten Wall Group, maybe plotting with Alex, Tina had decided to follow him. She’d even managed to send Blaine a message, sharing her location.
Magic begins at g α? ησ ν s?com
“Malcolm is at Nirvana…” Those words still echoed in Sadie’s mind.
Afterward, Tina had vanished without a trace.
Now, the search had ended with her lifeless body being discovered. Both Tina and Malcolm—gone, their fates sealed by the same cold current.
Both bodies ended up in the same stretch of riverbank.
No way could that be chalked up to mere chance.
Nothing about this scene pointed to a simple drowning.
A cold determination settled over Sadie’s expression as her suspicions grew.
Layers of secrets seemed to be woven into the tragedy before her.
Someone had made sure Malcolm wouldn’t survive that day.
And that person had worked just as hard to keep Tina from uncovering what really happened.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1284:
Because of that, both had met a brutal end. The words “Nirvana,” “Malcolm,” and “Tina” spun together in Sadie’s mind, each one dripping with significance.
A horrifying realization struck her like a bolt of electricity.
Who could the person have been?
Malcolm and Tina weren’t alone in Nirvana. Someone else had to be there with them.
Maybe that person had realized Tina was tracking Malcolm. Or maybe Tina had stumbled upon that person in the middle of a quiet meeting with Malcolm.
To cover their tracks, this person had acted mercilessly, ending two lives and dumping the bodies as if they were nothing.
Who could have done something so heartless?
Who would dare orchestrate such violence and cover it with such skill?
Alex’s name sprang to mind instantly.
With plenty of motive, he stood at the top of Sadie’s list.
Trouble had followed Malcolm ever since he stirred up chaos at the shareholders’ meeting, and Alex’s later invitation to Nirvana only hinted at hidden agendas between them.
Secrets exposed could have pushed Alex to extremes—if Tina learned too much, he might have silenced her to protect himself.
Still, would Alex really go so far as to kill Tina, the one person Sadie relied on above all others?
Suspicion crept elsewhere. Maybe the Wolfpack was involved. Everyone knew how the Wolfpack operated—ruthless and thorough, leaving no one alive to talk.
Even a small misstep by Malcolm or Tina could have made them targets.
There was also the possibility that someone even more dangerous, a hidden enemy Sadie had never suspected, might be behind it all.
Doubts and theories swirled in Sadie’s head, each one darker than the last.
A heavy grief pressed on her, but resolve quickly took its place in her eyes.
Step into a new world at gα?ησνs?c?m
Whoever orchestrated these murders, no matter how deeply they buried the truth, would face her determination. Nothing would stop her from uncovering the real killer.
Justice for Tina became her only goal.
She refused to let Tina’s death fade into obscurity.
Never—she would make certain of that.
Meanwhile, the restaurant manager rushed onto the chaotic scene, his gaze darting from the lifeless bodies to the swelling crowd and the relentless flashes of red and blue.
Nirvana’s fate now hung in the balance.
The deaths of two high-ranking Wall Group executives in such close proximity to the restaurant cast a dark shadow that would be hard to dispel.
Any whisper of scandal would be enough to ruin Nirvana, no matter how innocent they claimed to be.

###Chapter 1285:
Murderous fire burned in Sadie’s reddened eyes as she turned, pinning the shivering manager with a glare that could freeze blood. “Restore the surveillance footage within one day. If not, you might as well shut this place down for good.”
Her words, though quietly spoken, brooked no argument.
Panic flickered across the manager’s face. He nodded furiously, too afraid to protest, and hurried away to do her bidding.
Determination kept Sadie upright, even as her clenched fists left crescent marks in her palms and her eyes threatened to spill tears.
Suddenly, the shrill ring of her phone cut through the air.
Blaine’s name flashed on the screen, bringing a fresh wave of anxiety. Answering with trembling hands, she pressed the phone to her ear. The moment the call…
Blaine’s voice broke through the connection, thick with anxiety. “Sadie, what’s going on? Has anyone found Tina yet?”
Sadie remained silent. Her throat tightened, and no words would come. She couldn’t bring herself to deliver such heartbreaking news—not yet.
Blaine stayed quiet on the line, listening to the endless silence, a heavy dread tightening in his chest as if he already knew what was coming.
When he finally forced the words out, his voice wavered. The smile he tried to summon sounded fragile. “Sadie, please. Don’t do this. Just tell me what’s happening.”
Sadie’s strength gave out and she collapsed to her knees, the grief too heavy to bear. One trembling hand reached out to brush the chill from Tina’s still face, lingering on the stubborn spark of life that had once been there. Tears blurred her vision, spilling down her cheeks as her composure shattered.
Sadie closed her eyes and whispered, “Blaine, stay calm… Tina… she’s gone.”
Words left Sadie’s lips ragged and raw, each one a wound for herself and for Blaine, who could only listen in agony on the other end. Not far away, shadows concealed Alex as he stood with his security detail, his eyes tracking every heartbreaking moment.
The moment he caught sight of Sadie on the ground, clutching Tina’s lifeless body as sobs racked through her, something inside him twisted tight. It was as if an invisible hand had wrapped around his heart, crushing it until he could barely breathe from the weight of it. His fists tightened, knuckles pale and veins prominent, until he finally turned away, unable to stomach the sight any longer.
“You were supposed to keep her under control. How did you end up killing her?” His voice came out low and tense, heavy with barely contained fury and a trace of regret he didn’t try to hide.
Your source: glnvls.
Terror overtook the nearest guard, who fell to his knees. His words trembled. “Mr. Howe, I failed you. She fought so desperately—our team couldn’t hold on, and she slipped into the river. I tried to jump in after her, but the commotion drew attention, and we had to abandon the rescue.”
Alex listened in grim silence, exhaustion settling into his bones as he exhaled a weary sigh.
Dwelling on what was lost seemed pointless now; the damage had been done.
“Did you clean up everything?” Alex’s tone grew steadier, a mask of calm stretched tight over roiling anger.

###Chapter 1286:
Rapid nods came from the bodyguard. “All loose ends are tied up, sir. No evidence will point back to us.”
A silent wave of dismissal came from Alex, and the guard quickly scrambled to his feet.
Turning away from the chaos, Alex strode off, distancing himself from the river and the cries behind him. At the corner, he nearly collided with Beal.
Deference marked Beal’s greeting as he bowed his head. “Mr. Howe.” Troubled thoughts consumed Alex, leaving him too distracted to respond as he walked straight past without a word.
Beal watched Alex’s departing figure, then turned his attention to the bodyguard who had spoken to Alex.
A subtle nod passed between them, a silent communication in the dim light.
Satisfaction flickered across Beal’s face, his mouth curving into a knowing grin.
With Tina gone, the rift between Sadie and Alex would only deepen.
Every sign pointed to Humphrey’s scheme drawing closer to fruition.
The next day, the manager of Nirvana personally delivered the restored surveillance recordings to Myrtlewood Estate with an air of humility.
Recovery had come swiftly for Noah, who returned home from the hospital that very morning.
Side by side with Sadie, he studied the surveillance footage that Nirvana had provided.
Every detail in the video was crisp, capturing the entire property without blind spots.
Yet, not a single frame featured Tina or Malcolm anywhere in the establishment.
Somehow, it seemed they had simply vanished, their presence wiped from every angle.
Nearby, the nervous Nirvana manager wiped sweat from his brow, his voice wavering. “Ms. Hudson, Mr. Wall, after I got back, I questioned everyone on staff. No one saw Ms. Delgado or Mr. Pierce the previous day.”
A deep frown etched itself on Sadie’s face as she remained quiet, turning the facts over in her mind.
g?lnσνs?cóm is your escape
Giving up was not an option—Tina’s death demanded justice. Relentlessness set in; Sadie refused to let the murderer escape unpunished.
As she glanced about the room, it dawned on her that someone important was not there.
“Has anyone seen Blaine today?” she asked.noveldrama
Normally, Blaine would have shown up by now.
One of the bodyguards stepped forward, his tone tense. “Ms. Hudson, after your call with Mr. Castro yesterday, we haven’t been able to reach him at all.”
The news landed like a thunderbolt—Sadie sprang to her feet, her expression shifting in an instant. “Why didn’t anyone tell me sooner?” Blaine, as Ralph’s only grandson, couldn’t be left vulnerable—especially now, with danger circling so close.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1287:
Urgency sharpened Sadie’s tone as she turned to the stunned guards. “Well? Why are you just standing there? Go find him—now!”
Her orders snapped them into motion. Grim determination settled over their faces as they hurried out, ready to search every corner.
Silence swept through the sprawling living room, with just Sadie and Noah remaining.
Stillness hung heavy in the air, each second stretching uncomfortably between them.
A wave of vertigo hit Sadie, nearly toppling her before she caught herself.
Noah’s reflexes saved her from falling, his arms steady as he drew her against his chest.
“Try not to worry, Sadie. Blaine’s smart. He’ll be fine,” he remarked, his voice low and steady with reassurance.
Support from Noah offered small comfort as Sadie leaned against him, though his words couldn’t chase away the storm inside her.
Nothing eased the dread burrowed deep in her heart.noveldrama
All the recent disasters—from the loss of Tina to the tampered surveillance and Blaine’s sudden disappearance—felt too connected to be random.
Some hidden force seemed to tug at every string, always a step ahead.
A chill ran through Sadie, dread settling over her skin like ice.
With effort, she forced herself to breathe deeply, steadying her nerves.
Panic would get her nowhere; clarity was what the moment demanded. Chaos threatened to take over, but Sadie refused to let it win.
“We need to go to Castro Manor,” she said, her resolve cutting through the fear.
Glossy black paint glinted as the sedan rolled steadily toward Castro Manor. Passing scenery blurred into streaks beyond the window, yet inside the car, Sadie felt as though her chest carried a stone, making every breath feel shallow.
Noah’s tight grip on the wheel was evident in every taut line of his hands, silent strength radiating from his posture. From time to time, he glanced over, his eyes full of unspoken questions and quiet concern. His worry didn’t go unnoticed, but Sadie’s thoughts swirled too fast for comfort or conversation.
Before long, they pulled up to the gates of Castro Manor, the weight of what lay ahead settling over them. Waiting beneath the columns, Ralph stood tall and poised, his stern demeanor softening the moment he spotted Sadie. “Sadie, you’re finally here.”

Strong hands closed over hers, a steady presence that anchored her. “Come in. The weather’s far too cold to linger outside.” Even in his later years, Ralph exuded vitality—each word clear and confident. His warmth toward Sadie remained undiminished, offering her a brief sense of peace.
Behind them, Noah trailed quietly, his eyes sharp as he took in every detail of the entryway. With Ralph guiding her inside, Sadie answered questions about business and her wellbeing while carefully scanning her surroundings. Staff bustled about, the living room hummed with quiet activity, and the comforting aroma of fresh coffee filled the air. Appearances suggested that nothing was amiss.
.

.
###Chapter 1288:
Still, the absence of a familiar face unsettled her, tightening the knot of unease inside. Ralph ushered her onto the plush sofa and resumed his inquiries about the Wall Group’s affairs. Sadie answered each question patiently, her polite smile unwavering. She allowed no hint of anxiety to slip through; she needed Ralph to believe that everything was perfectly ordinary.
Older people often sensed trouble before it was spoken aloud, and the news about Tina remained lodged in Sadie’s throat—impossible to share, at least for now. Worry about Blaine pressed at the edges of her mind, but she shoved those thoughts aside, refusing to dwell on them.
She adopted an easy tone. “Mr. Castro, where is Blaine? Is he away on business?”
Ralph’s brows drew together, puzzlement flickering in his eyes. “Blaine? What’s happened to him? I haven’t heard from him in some time.” There was a hint of disapproval in his voice, but it gave way to quiet resignation. Tension wound tighter inside Sadie; if even Ralph was in the dark, then Blaine’s disappearance must be more serious than she had feared.
She tapped her forehead lightly and released a sheepish laugh. “Can you believe my memory? I sent Blaine out to oversee a project on the outskirts a few days ago. It’s a demanding assignment, so he’s probably engrossed in work and simply forgot to check in with you.” The excuse fell flat, but it was all Sadie had under the pressure.
Urgency gnawed at her—every instinct told her she must find Blaine as soon as possible.
“Mr. Castro, I have some pressing business at the company. We shouldn’t trouble you any longer,” Sadie said, rising from the sofa with an apologetic look.
A flicker of disappointment crossed Ralph’s face. “Leaving already?”
Warmth filled his eyes as he tried to persuade her to stay. “Why not join me for lunch, Sadie? The kitchen has been preparing your favorite dishes just for you.”
Guilt tugged at Sadie, but her worry for Blaine outweighed everything. “You’re too kind, Mr. Castro, but let’s save lunch for another day. I promise I’ll join you next time.”
Noah stepped forward, his timing perfect. “Mr. Castro, there’s a situation at the office that really can’t wait. We’ll be back to see you soon.”
Sighing, Ralph gave in. “All right, all right. Please drive safely, both of you. My door is always open—come back whenever you like.”
Every story starts at gα?ησν?s?com
Sadie offered a grateful nod. “I’ll remember, Mr. Castro.”
They exchanged farewells and slipped out of Castro Manor, heading back to the car. Not even a mile down the road, Sadie’s phone erupted into an urgent ring that cut through her thoughts.
A jolt of panic shot through her as she answered without hesitation. On the line, her bodyguard’s voice crackled with urgency. “Ms. Hudson!” His tone was strained. “We’ve located Mr. Castro.”
A chill swept through Sadie’s veins, her breath catching as anxiety took hold. “Where is he?”
“By the river where Tina’s body was discovered,” the bodyguard whispered, his voice barely more than a breath.noveldrama

###Chapter 1289:
Shock flooded Sadie’s mind, leaving everything spinning. The river where Tina’s body was discovered… What reason could Blaine possibly have for being there?
A heavy dread gripped her, squeezing tighter with each second. Her voice shook as she said, “Don’t lose sight of him. I’m coming now.” Volume rose as panic overwhelmed her.
Hanging up, Sadie felt her strength drain away and the color fade from her cheeks. Noah, who had been watching her closely, noticed every nuance of her reaction. Silence stretched between them as she slipped her phone into her pocket; he didn’t need to ask what had happened. Tires screeched as the black sedan swung around, and Noah pressed the accelerator, racing back along the road they had just traveled.
Thirty minutes later, the black sedan barreled down the riverside road, tires sending pebbles flying as it screeched to a halt. Before the car had even stopped, Sadie yanked the door open and stumbled onto the muddy ground. Terror thrummed in her chest, each heartbeat so loud she thought her heart might burst from her throat.
Please, anything but the worst, she begged silently, fear clawing at her resolve.
Police tape still marked the riverbank, though the crowds and camera flashes had long since faded, leaving only a few bodyguards standing at silent attention. Sadie’s frantic gaze swept the shoreline, searching for any sign of Blaine.
At last, she spotted him—a lone figure huddled in a quiet corner. Blaine sat with his back to her, empty liquor bottles scattered around him, lost to the world. His posture was slumped, his entire frame quivering with silent misery and a depth of loss that seemed to swallow him whole.
Relief washed over Sadie the moment she saw him alive, even if grief and alcohol had left him barely holding on. Alive was all she needed to see—her heart could finally unclench. A shaky breath escaped her lips, tangled with both gratitude and lingering anxiety, as she took a hesitant step forward.
Before she could go any farther, a steady, comforting hand closed around her arm. She glanced over at Noah, gentle yet unwavering, confusion flickering in her gaze as she searched his face for answers.noveldrama
A subtle nod and calm, thoughtful eyes told her everything she needed; Noah was urging patience, asking her to wait. He sensed her urge to reach out but recognized that Blaine needed something different in this moment. Certain kinds of anguish could only be eased by another man’s presence. “Let me handle this,” Noah said quietly, his tone smooth and resolute, leaving no room for doubt.
As Sadie watched the firm set of his jaw and the steady focus in his eyes, a quiet warmth rose in her chest. For a moment she hovered, torn, before finally giving a silent nod of approval. Something deep inside her admitted that Noah’s instincts might be the right call. Perhaps men really did have their own unspoken language for moments like these.
One more anxious glance drifted to Blaine, hunched and shivering in the morning chill, his figure nearly swallowed by sorrow. Sadie tore her eyes away with effort and turned on her heel to make her way into the nearby Nirvana. Answers had to be hiding somewhere within those walls, clues to Tina’s tragedy and the tampered surveillance that still gnawed at her mind.

Sadie vanished through Nirvana’s doorway, leaving Noah alone with Blaine. He stepped closer until he settled beside the grieving man, offering a gentle pat on the shoulder as a silent gesture of support. Blaine stayed frozen in place, unmoving, a man carved out of grief and regret.

###Chapter XXX:
Stillness thickened around them, the silence pressing in on both sides. Without fanfare, Noah reached for a bottle from a halfopen crate and flipped the cap off with practiced ease. He filled his own glass first and then topped off the one in Blaine’s hand. The quiet splash of liquid was the only sound breaking the tension. “Not a single clue has turned up yet,” Noah remarked, his voice steady but each word landing like a blow.
A sudden shudder ran through Blaine’s body at the news. Slowly, he raised his head, his bloodshot eyes brimming with agony and defeat.
His lips twitched as he tried to smile, but only a grimace emerged, and his voice rasped out, raw and broken. “Clue, huh… None of it matters. This is all my fault. Every bit of it.” Without warning, Blaine struck his own cheek, the sharp smack slicing through the hush of the riverbank.
Guilt tumbled from his lips in a desperate rush. “I should never have let Tina come here alone. If I’d noticed sooner, if I’d just stayed with her… none of this would have happened. This is on me. Every bit of it.” Regret weighed down every word as his fists trembled at his sides.
Where there had once been lightheartedness, only a fragile shell of his former self remained, lost and defeated. Noah stepped back, giving him space and watching quietly as his grief took its course. Comforting words would ring hollow right now—Blaine had to spill his pain before any healing could begin.
Eventually, the raw sobbing slowed, replaced by deep, uneven breaths. That was when Noah spoke, his voice calm as ever. “Did Tina cross anyone recently, someone who might have wanted to hurt her?” The question landed like a jolt, snapping Blaine from his downward spiral.noveldrama
Blaine lifted his head, confusion flickering across his bloodshot eyes before recognition settled in. Out of nowhere, the memory hit him—his strange allergic reaction and the sudden fainting episode from some time back. It had passed as quickly as it came, leaving even the doctors puzzled. At the time, he had dismissed it as nothing more than accidentally swallowing something, never investigating further. But now he realized he had barely opened his eyes in the hospital when the news of Tina’s passing came crashing down.
Tina’s last message had mentioned Malcolm and Nirvana, and the words still echoed in his memory. Nirvana was under Alex’s control.
Malcolm was the same man who had gone headtohead with him at that tense shareholders’ meeting, only to receive a private invitation from Alex not long after. Just the thought of Alex sent a chill crawling up Blaine’s spine.
He had always seen Alex as a rival for Sadie’s affection, but never suspected that beneath those polished manners lay something so dark. Suppose the allergy wasn’t a random mishap—suppose it was intentional. Would that mean Tina’s death was deliberate?
Shock drained the color from Blaine’s face. His lips quivered, and every word froze in his throat. He turned to Noah, terror clouding his gaze, his body weighed down by dread. A confession hovered on his lips, but he couldn’t bring himself to speak it.

Noah, noticing the change in Blaine’s expression, leaned in, concern etched on his brow. “Is something wrong?” he asked.
Blaine sighed, as if trying to expel the anxiety in one breath, and dragged a tired hand across his forehead. His voice was rough when he spoke. “It’s a complicated mess, but I’ll say this: there’s something seriously off about Alex.”

###Chapter 1291:noveldrama
A violent rush of fury coursed through Noah like a storm breaking loose. Of course it was Alex again, the man maddeningly precise, always three steps ahead. Alex had not just covered his tracks; he had engineered a rift between him and Sadie, like a puppeteer pulling strings in the dark. One flawless move, and two lives were collateral damage.
Noah clenched his fists and forced his rage down into his stomach. “I had Jack investigate him,” he said in a cold tone, his voice as sharp as frost on steel. “I wanted to know why Alex conveniently appeared in the urban village and managed to rescue Averi.”
Blaine’s brows furrowed in confusion. He remembered Tina voicing the same unease. When Averi vanished, the Castros had scoured Jazmah—every contact, every favor, every lead—and come up empty. Then Alex had stumbled upon Averi by chance? No, that reeked of calculation. It was a scene written and directed by Alex himself, designed to get closer to Sadie and earn her trust. The more Blaine replayed it, the more chilling it became.
If their suspicions were right, Alex was not just clever; he was dangerous. Terrifyingly so.
Noah’s jaw tightened, and his brow formed a hard line. “We can’t tell Sadie yet.”
Blaine’s chest constricted, but he offered a slow, reluctant nod. “I understand,” he murmured. “Tina and I discussed this. We have nothing concrete—nothing that would hold up in court. And Sadie trusts him.”
Alex had perfected the art of deception, charming and polished, always steps ahead. He played the role of the ideal friend with such ease that Sadie had never had a reason to doubt him.
Without proof, any accusation would backfire. Sadie would refuse to believe it, and Alex might catch wind of their suspicions. “And if we spook him…” Blaine’s voice faltered, trembling with dread.
“I’m afraid of what he might do. Sadie could be next. Alex killed Tina and Malcolm without hesitation or remorse. If he sensed that Sadie was beginning to question him, who could say he wouldn’t do the same to her? Tina is already gone. I refuse to lose Sadie too. I won’t let that happen.”
He swallowed against the cruel helplessness. They knew the truth. They could see the monster behind the mask. And yet they were trapped—with no evidence and no leverage.
Noah’s eyes turned to steel. “Maybe there is another way.”
Blaine blinked in surprise. “What do you mean?”

Noah lowered his voice, sharp and deliberate. “Hailey. She vanished without a trace. Ask yourself: who took her?”
Realization jolted through Blaine. Confusion followed. Hailey was no longer useful to Alex, so why would he bother saving her?
Noah’s frown deepened. “He is not after Hailey. He is after the child. Everyone believes the baby Hailey carried was his. Alex must know that, which means this is part of a larger game.”
Meanwhile, as soon as Sadie stepped into Nirvana, the manager hurried over, his forehead slick with sweat and his smile too wide. “Ms. Hudson, what a surprise. If you need anything, just let us know.”
Sadie gave him a polite nod, her expression unreadable. “No worries. I’m just looking around. You can get back to your duties.”
.

.
###Chapter 1292:
“Of course, of course. Don’t hesitate if you need anything.”
With that, the manager walked away, leaving Sadie to wander the softly lit halls. Something tugged at her, a subtle pull on her thoughts she couldn’t ignore. As she began ascending the staircase, a man in a tailored suit approached. He looked completely ordinary. Sadie stepped aside to let him pass, but he stopped directly in front of her.
“Good day, Ms. Hudson,” he said, his voice calm and unnervingly pleasant.noveldrama
Sadie studied the man standing before her, confusion flickering across her face. She couldn’t recall ever seeing him.
He offered a small bow, his posture formally respectful. “Ms. Hudson, my name is Beal Martin, Mr. Howe’s assistant.”
Sadie’s brows drew together in a frown. “What brings you here today?”
Beal’s practiced smile never wavered. “Mr. Howe dined at Nirvana yesterday and became rather taken with a particular fish dish. He asked me to return and bring him another serving.”
Sadie’s heartbeat quickened, and her gaze sharpened. Alex had dined at Nirvana yesterday, too? That revelation jolted through her mind. If Alex had been here, had he seen something? Had he noticed something important?
The subtle shift in her expression did not go unnoticed. A faint hint of satisfaction touched the corner of Beal’s mouth—his task was complete.
“I’ll let you get back to your day, Ms. Hudson. Please excuse me.” He turned sharply and strode toward the exit without another glance.
Still lost in thought, Sadie did not acknowledge his departure.
Beal descended the staircase in unhurried steps, disappeared through Nirvana’s doorway, and climbed into a sleek black Maybach waiting outside. Shadows filled the car’s interior.
“Mr. Perry,” Beal said, his voice reverting to its usual measured calm, “Sadie has received the message, just as you directed.”
In the shadowy back seat, Humphrey rolled a cigar between his fingers, its tip glowing softly. A smug grin stretched across his face. Every piece was falling into place exactly as he intended. With Sadie, Alex, and Noah caught up in the chaos, the game was only getting more thrilling.
“Nicely done. Keep an eye on Alex for me. The moment anything changes with him, I want to know right away,” Humphrey said.

“Of course, Mr. Perry,” Beal replied, bowing his head in agreement.
A moment later, Beal stepped out of the car. The Maybach slipped into traffic and vanished without a sound.
Meanwhile, Sadie drifted down Nirvana’s hallway, her mind spinning with unanswered questions. Footsteps echoed behind her, but she was too lost in thought to notice—until a pair of strong arms wrapped around her from behind. She tensed, caught completely off guard. A familiar fragrance drifted through the air.
The moment she recognized it, she spun around. “Noah?”
Resting his chin lightly on her head, Noah spoke with playful laziness. “What has you so deep in thought that you didn’t even hear me coming?”

###Chapter 1293:
Sadie took a deep breath and gently pulled away. “How’s Blaine holding up?”
Noah raised an eyebrow, feigning irritation, a spark of jealousy slipping into his voice. “Honestly, the way you worry about him is making me jealous.”
Sadie rolled her eyes and shot him a look. “Can you drop the jokes for once?”
Noah grinned, lighthearted even when the situation demanded seriousness. He reached over and mussed Sadie’s hair, his expression softening. “Relax. Blaine’s tougher than he looks—he just needs time to recover.”
He paused, studying Sadie’s face as his eyes grew serious. “Sadie, is there something you’re not telling me?”
Those words hit Sadie unexpectedly, leaving her momentarily stunned. Her thoughts raced. Was there anything she could say that would even make sense? For some reason, Jack’s broken phone flashed through her mind, along with that strange message. Had Noah really instructed Jack to rescue Hailey behind the scenes?
Her gaze drifted away from Noah’s; she found herself unable to meet his eyes. A sigh escaped him. “If there’s something bothering you, you can just tell me,” said Noah, his voice calm. “I sent Jack out that day to check on something for me. I still don’t have all the answers, so I’m not ready to explain just yet.” Nothing in his eyes suggested he was hiding anything—he looked completely honest.
Caught in that unwavering stare, Sadie realized he’d seen straight through her doubt, and embarrassment crept into her cheeks as she nodded, flustered. Compared to his honesty, her suspicions suddenly felt silly and unfounded. She lowered her voice. “I… I understand.”
Sadie deliberately fixed her eyes on the floor.
“Oh, right,” she said after a beat. “I ran into Beal, Alex’s assistant, downstairs. He mentioned Alex was at Nirvana yesterday, too.”
Noah’s expression tightened, his brows knitting together as a trace of surprise flickered in his gaze.
“Alex was at Nirvana yesterday?”
The coincidence was too sharp to ignore. It lined up almost too well with the theory he and Blaine had had. If Alex had really shown up there… was he tied to Tina’s and Malcolm’s deaths? Or worse…

Sadie’s eyes stayed on Noah as she quietly read the subtle shifts in his face. “What is it?” she asked gently.
“Nothing,” he replied, his tone clipped yet calm.
He reached out and softly brushed a thumb beneath her eye, tracing the faint weariness shadowing her skin. “You’ve had a long day, Sadie. Let’s head back to Myrtlewood Estate and get some rest.”
“I’m not tired,” she said, shaking her head with quiet determination. “I need to find Alex and ask if he saw anything yesterday.”noveldrama
At this point, every sliver of information mattered—there was no room for missed chances.
Noah exhaled, a soft sigh escaping as he took in her resolve. “I’ll go.”
Sadie paused, concern flickering in her eyes. The history between Noah and Alex was far from smooth, always teetering on the edge of conflict. She feared their next meeting could ignite another spark.

###Chapter 1294:
Reading her unspoken worry, Noah offered a faint, wry smile. “Relax. I won’t punch him this time.”
His unexpected humor pulled a laugh from Sadie’s lips, the tension in her chest loosening.
“Make sure you ask properly,” she said, a subtle curve at the corner of her mouth. “I’ll wait for you.” Her voice was steady, her gaze unwavering, full of quiet trust.
Noah nodded once, then turned to the nearby bodyguard. “Take Mrs. Wall home.”
Mrs. Wall? The words, simple yet weighty, wrapped around Sadie like a forgotten melody. Her heart gave a tiny lurch and warmth bloomed in her cheeks before she could stop it.
The bodyguard gave a respectful nod and led Sadie away.
Roughly thirty minutes later, a sleek black Maybach glided to a halt in front of Howe Manor. Noah stepped out, his movements calm and deliberate as he made his way to the entrance.
Just then, a maid hurried by, her arms weighed down with shopping bags that looked like heavy groceries.
Noah’s gaze drifted over the contents: cans of baby formula, packets of diapers, soft rattles, and tiny plush toys. A baby? At Howe Manor? His eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly, suspicion stirring beneath his composed exterior.
When had Alex become a father? He’d never heard a whisper of it—not from Sadie, not from anyone. Still, he buried the questions in his mind and stepped inside, his expression unreadable.
In the living room, Alex lounged on the sofa, steam curling from the coffee cup in his hand. At the sound of footsteps, he lifted his head, his eyes landing on Noah with a flicker of surprise. He clearly hadn’t been expecting him.
“Mr. Wall,” Alex said coolly, setting down his coffee with deliberate calm. “To what do I owe the pleasure of this unannounced visit?”
Noah took a few measured steps into the room, his eyes briefly scanning the space before settling on Alex with a faint smile. “I didn’t expect your home to be so… lively, Mr. Howe,” he said lightly. “I just passed a maid at the door carrying baby supplies—formula, diapers, toys. When did you become a father? You should have informed us so Sadie and I could come and congratulate you.”
For a split second, Alex’s hand trembled. A flicker of unease crossed his eyes as he cast a sharp glance at the butler nearby.
The butler visibly blanched, shrinking under the weight of that look. His head dropped instantly, shoulders tense with fear, lips sealed. Alex recovered with practiced ease, the familiar polished smile returning to his face.

“You must be joking, Mr. Wall,” he said with a small chuckle. “There’s no child here. You probably saw one of the staff bringing personal items. Some of them have young families. These things happen.”
The explanation slid from his tongue with seamless precision, as if the confusion were nothing more than a trivial error.
Noah tilted his head slightly, his smile widening—yet his eyes remained glacial. “Is that so?” he murmured. “You’re generous indeed, Mr. Howe. Letting employees bring their little ones along… very modern of you.” His voice was smooth, laced with polite amusement, but the undertone was unmistakable.

###Chapter XXX:
Alex’s hand, hidden in the shadows, slowly curled into a clenched fist. What exactly was Noah playing at with this cryptic visit and vague remarks? Had he found something out, or was he fishing, hoping to shake something loose?
Noah’s smile deepened with deliberate ease, his gaze locked onto Alex with quiet intensity. “Not even going to offer me a seat, Mr. Howe?”
Alex’s lips held their curve, but a chill flickered behind his eyes. Something was off about Noah—his presence, his words, his calm confidence. What on earth was he up to?
“What is it that you really want, Mr. Wall?” Alex asked, his tone laced with polite civility. “You didn’t just drop by without reason. Let’s not waste each other’s time.”
Noah’s smile remained cool and enigmatic as his voice dropped a note lower. “I heard you were at Nirvana yesterday.”
The moment Alex heard the words, the hand holding the coffee paused for the briefest second. A flicker of tension crossed his face, gone almost as quickly as it came. How did Noah know that? No one should have seen him—not unless someone at Nirvana had talked. But that was impossible. Alex trusted his people to erase every footprint.
Still, none of that mattered now. What mattered was that this visit wasn’t casual—it was an interrogation dressed in silk.
“That’s right,” Alex replied evenly. “I went there for a meal. Simple as that.” Then, as if struck by sudden remembrance, he added with a calculated sigh and a touch of sorrow slipping into his voice, “I heard about Miss Delgado’s death. Terrible news. But surely, Mr. Wall, you’re not suggesting I had something to do with it, are you?”
Alex posed the question with such transparent openness as though he were nothing more than an innocent bystander.
Noah’s gaze transformed into twin daggers slicing through the air and piercing Alex’s fa?ade. “Yes. I do suspect you.”
The moment those words tumbled from Noah’s lips, tension thickened in the room like fog rolling in from a storm.
Behind his back, Alex’s hand curled into a brutal fist, his fingernails carving crescents of pain into his palm.
The audacity of it all—Noah had the nerve to suspect him so openly, so brazenly.noveldrama
Lаt?st chαpt?rs in g?lnov?ls.?οm
On what evidence?
Nothing but groundless theories and wild assumptions.
Rage erupted in Alex’s chest like molten lava threatening to break free. But in the span of a heartbeat, the rigid mask he wore dissolved like morning frost, and he released a low rumbling laugh that seemed to come from somewhere deep within.
The sound carried threads of bitter self mockery woven together with strands of reluctant resignation.
“Mr. Wall, you certainly have a talent for humor. Miss Delgado is one of Sadie’s dearest friends. I would never bring harm to Sadie or anyone who matters to her.”
He deliberately emphasized Sadie’s name like a sacred vow or desperate declaration.
Noah studied him with calculating precision, a flash of dark irony flickering across his features.

###Chapter XXX:
Alex’s performance deserved standing ovations. It was nothing short of masterful theater.noveldrama
Had Noah not already nursed his growing doubts, this elaborate exhibition of devotion might have completely deceived him.
Noah’s own laughter bubbled up unexpectedly, though his eyes stayed cold as winter steel.
“I was merely joking. You did not take me seriously, did you, Mr. Howe?” Noah rose from his seat with fluid grace, adjusting his sleeves with the refined composure of generations of breeding. “Given the circumstances, I should take my leave and stop imposing on your valuable time.”
Alex maintained that practiced smile while his eyes transformed into twin glaciers of barely contained hostility. “Safe travels, Mr. Wall. I trust you can find your way out without my assistance.”
Noah pivoted on his heel and strode from Howe Manor, each footstep measured and deliberate.
Only when Noah’s imposing silhouette had vanished from sight did the carefully crafted smile tear away from Alex’s face like a mask ripped from its moorings.
Without warning, he flung the coffee cup from his grip and watched it crash against the marble floor. “Bang!”
The delicate china erupted into countless fragments, each shard catching the light like a scattered mirror. Thick veins snaked across the back of his hand, and his chest heaved in savage, uncontrolled bursts.
That cursed Noah! Alex had been certain he had erased every trace of his presence, yet somehow Noah had discovered his visit to Nirvana—how could that be possible? Had he made a critical error and left behind some telling clue? A bone-chilling thought sliced through his mind.
What if Sadie had discovered the truth as well? The idea of Sadie harboring even the smallest doubt about him was intolerable.
Shadows darkened his features as he whirled toward the butler, who already trembled like a leaf in a storm. Alex’s voice dropped to an arctic whisper. “I want answers. Track down whoever betrayed this information and bring me their name.”
The butler’s knees nearly buckled under Alex’s menacing presence. He dropped into a desperate bow. “Of course, Mr. Howe. I will begin the investigation immediately, sir.”
By the time Noah returned to Myrtlewood Estate, Sadie had arranged an elaborate feast and sat at the dining table, her thoughts restless as she waited. The moment she saw Noah’s familiar silhouette in the doorway, she sprang to her feet and rushed toward him. “How did it go?”
Your next story begins at . com
Though she kept her concerns unspoken, anxiety gnawed at her from within. Part of her refused to believe that Alex could be capable of such ruthless behavior.
Throughout her darkest hours, Alex had remained her steadfast companion, offering countless acts of kindness and unwavering support. Yet the circumstances surrounding Tina’s death bristled with unanswered questions, compelling Sadie to scrutinize every potential threat, no matter how painful. This internal conflict between loyalty and suspicion tortured her soul relentlessly.

###Chapter XXX:
Noah studied the worry etched across her delicate features, then reached out to gently sweep a stray strand of hair from her troubled brow. He looked away from her searching gaze, and when he spoke, his voice was calm and unemotional. “He simply went there to dine. It had nothing to do with him.”
Sadie released a long-held breath as tension drained from her shoulders like melting ice. What a blessed relief! Alex was innocent. Her instincts had been right all along—Alex possessed too much honor and integrity to commit such a heinous act. She had allowed her imagination to spiral beyond reason.
When Sadie was at her lowest, Alex had been the one to reach out and offer support. That act of kindness had stayed with her, and she treasured their friendship deeply. Doubting him had been the last thing on her mind, and she sincerely hoped she’d never have to.
Now, with Noah’s reassuring words, the weight on her chest finally eased. A genuine smile spread across her face as she grabbed his hand and pulled him toward the dining table. “Come on, try everything! I really hope you’ll like what I made.”
Noah’s dark gaze shifted, conflicted emotions swirling beneath the surface. He hadn’t told her the truth—not because he didn’t believe in her, but because she’d already been through so much. Tina’s death had hit Sadie hard, leaving a wound that wouldn’t heal quickly. If she ever discovered that Alex might be tied to Tina’s death, Noah couldn’t imagine how she’d cope.
On top of that, he had no concrete evidence to back up his suspicions. He refused to risk tipping anyone off or adding to Sadie’s pain without knowing for sure. One thing was certain—he would uncover the truth behind Tina’s death, no matter what it took. Anyone responsible, Alex included, would face consequences.
During dinner, Sadie kept the mood light, serving him food and sharing funny stories from her days at Wall Group. Noah sat quietly, listening to her chatter and occasionally offering a soft reply. Dinner felt warm and easy, though an unspoken tension lingered beneath the surface as each harbored different thoughts.
As night deepened, Noah excused himself and disappeared into the study. Sadie watched his tired silhouette walk away, a swirl of unspoken emotions rising in her chest. No sooner had Noah settled into his chair than his phone buzzed. Blaine’s name lit up the screen.
He answered with a quiet, “Hey.”noveldrama
Blaine’s voice carried a hint of urgency. “Noah, any updates? Have you noticed anything off about Alex?”
Noah leaned back, absentmindedly drumming his fingers on the desk. Even after all this time, Alex still felt like a mystery—someone he could never quite read.
“He’s still an unknown right now,” Noah replied, his tone even and unreadable. “I can’t tell if he’s just covering his tracks or if he truly has nothing to do with all of this.”
Noah wasn’t ready to draw any conclusions. Jumping to conclusions without real proof would be reckless. Blaine paused, letting the silence stretch as he considered Noah’s point. If Alex really was pulling the strings, he certainly wouldn’t make any obvious mistakes.
Shifting gears, Noah mentioned something else he’d noticed. “By the way, I saw one of his household staff return with a lot of baby supplies.”
Blaine’s eyes widened in surprise. Baby supplies? Why would Alex have baby things in his house? Perhaps… a possibility flashed through his mind. His thoughts jumped straight to Hailey and the baby she’d been expecting.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1298:
“You’re not saying…” Blaine’s words caught in his throat. “Is it possible that Alex actually rescued Hailey, and she went ahead and had the baby?”
It sounded far-fetched, but remembering all of Alex’s strange behaviors lately, Blaine couldn’t dismiss the idea outright. If Noah’s hunch was right, then Alex’s motives went way beyond just making trouble for Wall Group.
Blaine’s voice dropped, suddenly heavy with gravity. He drew in a long breath, as if bracing himself. “Noah, I have to ask you something. Just be straight with me. Is Hailey’s baby actually yours?”
It was a question that had nagged at him for a long time, but he’d never found the courage to bring it up until now. Tina’s death had made him rethink everything, turning over old memories for signs he might have missed.
Noah’s fingers tensed around the phone. A tense silence hung between them, broken only by his quiet, steady breathing.
“No. The child isn’t mine.”
His voice was unwavering. He meant every word. Sadie was the only one he’d ever cared for, then and now.
He explained gently, “I only made sure Hailey was looked after because she once helped me out. That’s all there ever was. Nothing more.”
Noah felt indebted to Hailey. However, this feeling had nothing to do with love or even a sense of duty. “As for the identity of the child’s biological father, I honestly don’t know.” Hailey had never shared any details with him.
On the other end of the line, Blaine finally breathed a long sigh of relief. He had suspected as much, but hearing Noah deny it himself lifted a weight from his shoulders. Knowing Noah wasn’t the father gave Blaine a way to move forward.
“Let me handle things from here,” Blaine said, sounding more confident. “I’ll arrange for someone to investigate thoroughly.” Whether it was Alex, Hailey, or the child’s parentage, he was determined to get to the bottom of it all—for Tina’s sake and for Sadie’s.
After the call ended, Noah rubbed his temples, completely drained. Everything that had happened recently pressed down on him, making it hard to breathe. He knew he needed answers fast so Sadie could finally live without worry.
A few moments later, his phone buzzed again in the silent study, the sound startling him. He looked down to see a new text message: “I’ve managed to get inside the headquarters.”
Those simple words were enough to ease some of the tension he’d been carrying. At last, progress was being made—the most important step was finally underway.

Without a word, Noah deleted the message and stared into the distance, his mind racing.
The door to the study swung open with a quiet click. Sadie stepped in, holding a plate of neatly sliced fruit. Light from the hallway stretched her delicate shadow across the floor. Not wanting her to notice anything, Noah quickly locked his phone and set it down on the desk as if nothing had happened.
He rose to his feet, his voice soft. “You should be sleeping by now. What’s keeping you up this late?”
Sadie set the fruit plate on the coffee table. Her eyes flickered toward the phone he’d just put away, but she quickly looked elsewhere. For a moment, she wondered about his behavior, then dismissed it—he was probably dealing with work.

###Chapter 1299:
“I just couldn’t fall asleep,” she admitted. “Everything has been so overwhelming, and I can’t quiet my mind.”
Thoughts of Tina’s bright smile and cheerful voice looped in Sadie’s head. There was no way she could rest with so much on her mind.noveldrama
Noah crossed the room and wrapped her in a firm, protective hug. Feeling her tremble against him, he realized how much sadness she’d been bottling up. He held her closer, sharing the ache in his heart.
“Sadie, just hold on a bit longer. When all of this is behind us…” He paused, brushing his chin over her hair. “We’ll let Blaine run the company. I’ll take you and Averi away to someplace quiet, where nobody knows us, and we can live in peace. Would you like that?”
Sadie felt a little of her anxiety slip away. A soft, raspy laugh escaped as she relaxed in his arms. “We’d better not let Blaine hear that. He’d probably grumble about us dumping all the hard work on him.”
She could already imagine Blaine’s dramatic complaints and exaggerated frown.
Noah’s lips curled into a gentle smile. He was glad to see her finally laugh. Leaning down, he pressed a warm kiss to her forehead.
“Don’t worry about anything, Sadie. Everything is going to turn out fine. No matter what, I’ll stay by your side and face whatever comes our way together.”
Nestled in his arms, Sadie nodded with determination. His familiar scent settled her restless thoughts. Having Noah close gave her a rare sense of peace.
By morning, Sadie slowly opened her eyes, her mind still a bit foggy. Her hand instinctively reached across the bed, only to find the other side empty and cold. A brief pause settled over her before she sat up.
“Noah?” she called softly, her voice still thick with sleep.
No answer came. The room remained silent.
A light knock sounded at the bedroom door.
One of the servants stepped inside holding a glass of water. “Good morning, madam. Mr. Wall left a little while ago. He asked the kitchen to prepare breakfast for you. Would you like it served now?”
Dive into the story world at gα?ησvs?c?m
Sadie’s eyes drifted to the clock on the bedside table. It was just past eight. She wondered at how early Noah had gone out. Was his work really that urgent today? A strange feeling settled in her chest, one she couldn’t quite name.
“All right,” she said. “You can bring it up.”
With a nod, the servant left the room. Sadie tossed aside the blankets and swung her feet onto the thick carpet, padding over to the wardrobe. She opened it and searched for something soft and comfortable to wear. As her hand moved along the hangers, her fingertips brushed against a smooth shirt—and suddenly a small round rolled out from a dark corner, coming to a stop on the floor.
A puzzled frown creased her forehead as she bent to pick it up. It was a single pearl. Something about it felt strangely familiar. Turning it over in her palm, Sadie examined it with growing curiosity.
It dawned on her: this was the same pearl she had discovered during her last visit to Faron Retreat. She had wondered at the time how it had gotten there. With everything else going on, she had pushed that mystery aside. Now, she never imagined she would stumble across it here.

###Chapter 1300:
Just as Sadie moved to place the pearl in her jewelry box, an unsettling detail caught her attention. Beneath her fingertips, its surface felt coarse—far from the silky perfection of a genuine pearl. Examining it more closely, she realized with a sinking heart that this was no more than an elaborate imitation. Microscopic ridges from layered manufacturing materials marred its finish, and its shine had a stiff, artificial quality. Why would a counterfeit pearl lie among the ashes of the ruined Faron Estate?
A shiver ran through her as hidden threads seemed to weave through the mystery—connections she couldn’t yet grasp. In a momentary lapse, the pearl slipped from her fingers and struck the hardwood floor with a decisive crack, shattering into fragments. Like a secret freed from its shell, a tiny black USB drive tumbled out and came to rest amid the debris.
Sadie’s breath caught. What could it contain? Her pulse thundered as she dropped to her knees, scooping up the device with trembling fingers. She staggered toward the study, legs unsteady, and inserted the USB into her computer. The monitor flickered, revealing a password prompt.noveldrama
Frustration creased Sadie’s brow as she tried several obvious combinations, each rejected with cold finality. Drawing in a steadying breath, she let impulse guide her and typed her birth date. Instantly, the password box vanished and a hidden folder opened before her eyes.
Her birth date had been the password all along.
A storm of conflicting emotions churned within Sadie’s chest—surprise wrestled with something deeper, something dangerously close to hope. The directory contained an overwhelming collection of documents stretching endlessly down the screen.
When Sadie clicked the first file, her eyes widened before contracting to pinpoints of shock. Every single document represented her mother’s life’s work—the invaluable research that had consumed her final years. These were the exact files the Wolfpack had murdered and betrayed to possess.
Sadie’s hands curled into tight, trembling fists as the magnitude of the discovery crashed over her. Her brilliant mother had orchestrated the perfect hiding place, sealing away her most precious work behind the date that had brought her greatest joy into the world.
Without hesitation, she reached for her phone and dialed Noah’s number, fighting to keep her voice steady as she delivered the earthshattering revelation.
On the other end, Noah was taken aback. After a few seconds of silence, his steady voice came through. “Sadie, listen carefully—don’t take any risks or leave the estate under any circumstances. Stay exactly where you are until I return.”
Once the call ended, Noah raised his eyes to meet Blaine’s expectant stare across the table, his expression heavy with unspoken implications. “Can you guarantee the accuracy of this information?”
Blaine nodded gravely. “There’s no room for error in what I’ve uncovered.” Every piece of intelligence he’d collected painted the same undeniable picture.
Three years ago, during their time in Zupren, Hailey had maintained a secret relationship with Sutton. That revelation triggered a buried memory in Noah’s mind. Hailey’s behavior after Sutton’s death had been anything but normal—it carried undertones he should have recognized at the time. During that same period, Sadie had nearly been framed for Sutton’s murder through a web of carefully planted evidence.

###Chapter 1301:
Despite the fog of amnesia that had clouded his judgment at the time, hindsight now revealed unmistakable fingerprints of deliberate manipulation throughout the entire ordeal. It seemed there was more to the story than anyone had suspected.
Deep lines of concentration carved themselves across Noah’s forehead as troubling thoughts took hold. With his characteristic sharp intuition, Blaine immediately caught the shift in Noah’s demeanor. “Are you beginning to believe there was more to Sutton’s death?”
Noah inclined his head in grim confirmation. “I need you to get to Eastwood Manor immediately. Track down every single person who was there that day and extract every detail they remember.” That entire period had been riddled with unanswered questions, yet countless diversions and complications had prevented a proper investigation.
The time had finally arrived to drag those buried secrets back into the light. Understanding sparked in Blaine’s gaze like struck flint, quickly followed by the unmistakable gleam of someone who relished a complex puzzle. “This web of deception grows more fascinating by the hour.”
Noah’s stare could have frozen summer rain. “Save your commentary for later. Just make sure you come back in one piece.”
Though Blaine’s trademark smirk played across his lips with practiced ease, his eyes carried the weight of genuine concern. The true scope of their predicament was becoming alarmingly clear: they were dealing with something far more dangerous than initial appearances suggested.
Blaine laid a reassuring hand on Noah’s shoulder. “Keep your mind at ease.” Without another moment’s hesitation, he spun on his heel and departed with purposeful strides.
Neither man realized that from a carefully concealed vantage point among the shadows, someone had been watching their every movement with predatory patience. The moment Blaine’s vehicle vanished around the distant corner, the hidden figure retrieved a phone and began typing with practiced efficiency. “Noah and Blaine have begun investigating Sutton’s death, which appears connected to Ms. Burgess.”
Once the message was sent, the mysterious observer melted back into the darkness as though they had never been there.
Miles away, within the Howe Manor, the study existed in a world of muted shadows and amber lamplight. Alex cradled a cigarette between his elegant fingers, its crimson tip pulsing like a tiny heartbeat against the surrounding gloom. The sudden illumination of his phone’s screen cut through the darkness, revealing an encrypted communication that demanded his immediate attention.noveldrama
His eyes scanned each word with the methodical precision of someone accustomed to parsing dangerous information. Why would Noah and Blaine suddenly turn their attention to Sutton’s death? This development fell completely outside the parameters of Alex’s carefully calculated predictions. Sutton’s death had been officially closed for a long time—what could motivate them to resurrect such ancient history? And what role did Hailey play in this?

Displeasure etched itself deep into Alex’s features as unwelcome possibilities began to surface. It appeared that Hailey possessed far more hidden depths than he had ever suspected. What kind of clandestine relationship had she maintained with Sutton back then? Could it derail the elaborate schemes he had devised? The mere thought of variables beyond his influence made his skin crawl with barely contained rage.

###Chapter 1302:
He reached for the intercom system, forcing his tone into a mask of deceptive tranquility. “Fetch Hailey immediately,” he commanded, “there are certain matters we need to discuss in private.”
Within minutes the guards escorted Hailey into the room. She wore simple, comfortable clothes with her hair pulled back in a casual knot. Exhaustion shadowed her features, yet her eyes remained sharp and watchful.
From behind his imposing desk, Alex raised his head and studied her with the calculating stare of a predator sizing up prey. “Were you acquainted with Sutton Wall?”
Hailey’s heart lurched violently against her ribs. Her mind raced frantically. What had prompted Alex to drag Sutton’s name into this conversation? Had he uncovered her secret? She wrestled her panic into submission and arranged her features into a mask of genuine confusion. “Sutton Wall? I don’t know him. What makes you mention him, Mr.?Howe?”
Alex’s dark eyes contracted to dangerous slits as he catalogued every microexpression that flickered across her face. “Noah and Blaine have launched an investigation into this individual. I suggest you choose your words with extreme care. You’re well aware of what happens to people who lie to me.”
Concealed within her sleeves, Hailey’s hands curled into trembling fists. If Alex discovered that Salex wasn’t Noah’s child but Sutton’s, both she and Salex would face execution. Alex possessed a brilliant mind wrapped around a stonecold heart—gambling with him meant certain death.
But what had triggered Noah and Blaine’s sudden interest in digging up Sutton’s past? Sutton had been resting in his grave for almost half a year—why couldn’t they let sleeping dogs lie?
Drawing upon every ounce of courage, Hailey locked eyes with Alex. “Mr.?Howe, I genuinely do not know this person. And I don’t know why Noah and Blaine are investigating him.”
Alex released a derisive snort that made his skepticism crystal clear. “For your sake, that had better be the truth.”
He dismissed her with a curt flick of his wrist. “Remove her from my sight.”
His bodyguards stepped forward with practiced efficiency, maintaining courteous facades as they escorted Hailey away. They returned her to her gilded cage—a chamber masquerading as a sanctuary but functioning as a prison cell.
Step into fiction with gα?ησν?so
Alex never spoke carelessly or without purpose. His mention of Sutton carried ominous implications that chilled her blood. Noah and Blaine’s investigation into Sutton struck her as deeply troubling and completely out of character. If they somehow uncovered that she had killed Sutton, then…
Hailey’s thoughts slammed into a wall of terror as cold perspiration soaked her shirt and traced icy paths down her spine. Imprisoned within Alex’s estate, she couldn’t even set foot beyond the gates—what options remained?noveldrama
She prowled the confines of her chamber like a caged animal, anxiety consuming her every step. Then a name blazed across her mind—Beal.
Alex’s assistant, who had skulked outside the living room that day with suspicious intent, struck her as far more complex than his position suggested. A man of Alex’s caliber would never surround himself with ordinary subordinates.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1303:
After a moment’s deliberation, Hailey strode to the door with newfound purpose. “I need to speak with Mr. Howe’s assistant, Beal Martin.”
The guards stationed outside fixed her with skeptical stares. “What business do you have with Mr. Martin, Ms.?Burgess?”
Hailey allowed a flicker of maternal concern to cross her features. “Salex needs several items. I hope Mr. Martin can arrange to purchase them.”
The guards exchanged a meaningful look. Then one, recalling Alex’s explicit orders to accommodate every request from Hailey and Salex—especially anything concerning the boy—nodded. “Give us a moment.” He pivoted and disappeared down the corridor.
Within minutes, Beal appeared in the doorway. His face was carved from stone, though his eyes burned with suspicious intensity. Recognition sparked in his mind—this was the same woman who had tried to extract information from him before, earning herself a stern warning. Now she had boldly summoned him to her presence. What scheme was brewing in that desperate mind of hers?noveldrama
As soon as she saw him, Hailey cut straight to the chase. “Who’s pulling your strings besides Alex?”
Beal’s gaze sharpened into twin daggers as arctic fury flooded his expression. The foolish woman had completely ignored his earlier threat. This reckless creature possessed either remarkable courage or staggering stupidity.
Lethal promise flashed in his narrowed eyes like lightning across a storm cloud. Hailey seemed oblivious to the deadly shift in his demeanor. “I propose an alliance,” she declared, then lowered her voice to a conspiratorial hush. “With whoever commands your true loyalty.”
Harsh laughter erupted from Beal’s throat, dripping with contempt. This prisoner believed she held any bargaining power? She could barely guarantee her own survival—what assets could she possibly offer? The delusion was absurd.
Color drained from Hailey’s cheeks under his withering stare. As the heiress of the Burgess family, she had seldom faced such blatant disrespect in her privileged life. She bit her lower lip, fighting to contain the rage boiling within her.
“I bear the blood of the Burgess family,” she said through clenched teeth. “The Burgess name commands respect among Zupren’s most powerful elite.”
Hailey expected that invoking her family’s influential name would shift the balance in her favor. Instead, Beal’s smirk deepened, amusement dancing in his eyes. Burgess family or not—what difference did it make? No matter her status, she remained a prisoner in Alex’s grasp, stripped of any real autonomy. Beal assumed she expected someone to risk everything to rescue her.

“No chance,” he said without hesitation. “Alex’s eyes are everywhere. We’d be signing our own death warrants if we tried to get you out.”
Hailey’s brow creased briefly, then a glimmer of realization softened her features. “I’m not asking you to rescue me.”
Beal’s eyebrow shot up in surprise. If not that, then what did she want?
Hailey leaned forward, her voice dropping as she delivered the real bombshell. “Noah is investigating Sutton’s death.”
At last, Beal’s expression shifted, the news clearly hitting home. Sutton’s death had been a closed case for half a year—why would Noah suddenly want to reopen it now? Something buried beneath the surface had to be driving this renewed interest. And the fact that Hailey chose this moment to mention it was no coincidence.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1304:
A new light flickered in Beal’s eyes as he studied her, curiosity overtaking skepticism. Sensing his change of mood, Hailey pressed on. “Name your terms. If you’re willing to help, I’ll agree to whatever you ask.” She saw no other path left to take.noveldrama
Alex’s suspicions were growing by the day, and now Noah was reopening Sutton’s case. If her secrets came to light, she and Salex would have nowhere to hide.
Beal said nothing at first, watching her with a complicated gaze, torn between caution and intrigue. For a split second, he hesitated—this was far above his pay grade, the kind of matter only Humphrey could handle. Even so, he wasn’t ready to commit without more information.
“I might be able to help,” he said at last, his voice flat and unreadable. “But you’ll have to lay everything out—leave nothing in the shadows.”
A storm of hesitation passed over Hailey’s face, but her resolve solidified almost instantly.
Backed into a corner, Hailey realized trust was her only weapon left. “Sutton and I were together once,” she admitted, finally revealing a truth she had kept hidden for years.
Beal’s eyes narrowed, a flicker of shock slipping through his mask. That revelation caught him completely off guard. Suddenly, it made perfect sense how Hailey knew so many things.
She pressed on, her words dragging out like a confession under duress. “It was me who killed Sutton and framed Sadie.” Raising her chin, she fixed Beal with a wild stare. “Salex isn’t Noah’s child. Sutton is his real father.”
That revelation detonated in the room, leaving Beal momentarily speechless. Never in his wildest conjectures had he imagined the truth could be so explosive. He quickly recognized just how calculating and ruthless Hailey could be: murder, betrayal, deception about her son’s parentage—she had pulled it all off without a flicker of remorse.
For the first time, Beal regarded Hailey as more than just another pawn. With that kind of cunning and insider knowledge, she could become an invaluable tool—if kept on a short leash. Quietly, he made his way out of the room, his expression unchanged though his thoughts raced with new possibilities. Contacting Humphrey shot to the top of his priorities.
Down a shadowy alleyway, a nondescript black sedan idled, engine humming low. Sliding into the passenger side, Beal greeted the man inside. “Mr. Perry.”
Beal repeated every detail Hailey had confessed: Noah’s renewed investigation into Sutton’s death, her history with Sutton, how she had killed him and framed Sadie, and the most astonishing truth of all—Salex’s real biological father.
An oppressive silence filled the car. From the shadows in the back seat, a faint, chilling laugh broke the stillness. Humphrey leaned forward so the streetlights carved harsh lines across his face. His smile flickered with menace, a dangerous gleam simmering just below the surface. Alex had strutted through life certain that Noah’s blood gave him power over the Wall Group, confident that nothing could shake his hold. Ridiculous. It turned out the boy was not Noah’s child, and Hailey had managed to turn the tables in ways he never expected.

A sinister grin tugged at Humphrey’s lips as a flawless scheme began to form in his mind. Nothing appealed to him more than Alex’s ruin; he could almost taste its sweetness. “Let her think we’re going along with whatever she wants,” he said. “Promise her favors if that’s what it takes. I want her to become our most ruthless weapon—and I want her to choose it herself.”
.

###Chapter 1305:
Beal dropped his gaze and replied with quiet respect, “Understood, Mr. Perry.”
No question remained about Humphrey’s intentions.
Eastwood Manor buzzed with quiet activity as Blaine pulled up in his striking sports car. His trademark grin was warm and easy, though a glimmer of calculation hid in his eyes. Without hesitation, he crossed the driveway and walked into the lobby, each step brisk and sure.noveldrama
“I need to speak with your manager,” he said softly, though no one could miss the command in his voice.
A roundbellied man in a crisp suit hurried over, wiping sweat from his brow. “Mr. Castro, it’s an honor to have you with us. How can I assist you today?”
Blaine offered a lazy glance. “Gather everyone who was on staff the day Sutton died. I want to speak to all of them.”
The manager’s practiced smile wavered. He looked away, suddenly nervous. A shadow passed over his features as he realized the bind he was in. “I’m very sorry, Mr. Castro, but you understand how the service industry goes. There’s a constant flow of new faces. Just last month, we had to replace the entire staff at the manor. The people you’re looking for aren’t here anymore—they’ve all been dismissed.”
Blaine’s surprise was impossible to hide. Dismissed a month ago? That timing was far too coincidental. He leaned in and asked, “What about their files? You keep staff records, don’t you? Those must still exist somewhere.”
A river of sweat threatened to break free from the manager’s brow as he started fidgeting. He threw up his hands and shook his head, his voice trembling. “It’s not that simple, sir. With this drought, the archives room caught fire. Most of the paperwork was destroyed. Whatever you’re after—those files are long gone.”
Blaine’s eyebrows drew together in a skeptical line. Did the manager really think he was a fool, tricked by such a tale? Anyone could see he was lying. Watching Blaine’s steady silence, the manager’s anxiety grew. Sweat tracked down his cheeks, and a cold fear twisted in his gut. He understood that Blaine wasn’t a man to toy with. While the manager struggled to remain calm, Blaine caught his expression and sneered.
He let out a slow breath and finally waved the manager off. “Never mind. If they’re truly gone, I won’t cause you any trouble. I’ll just head to the police station and get the records myself.”
With that, Blaine pivoted, appearing ready to walk away. The manager, believing the ordeal was over, nearly collapsed with relief. His shoulders slumped and he finally breathed easily for the first time since Blaine’s arrival.
Just as he allowed himself that hope, it vanished. Blaine came to an abrupt stop midstep—so sudden it was almost comical—then whipped around without hesitation. Not much escaped Blaine’s sharp gaze, and he saw the flicker of relief on the manager’s face. A second later, the manager went rigid, every muscle tensing as he watched Blaine return.
What could have brought him back? Blaine’s lips curved into a smile that held more secrets than warmth. He knew something was wrong. He sensed the manager was hiding far more than he’d admitted. Yet Blaine chose not to press the issue—at least not yet.
With an impeccable display of innocence, Blaine smiled, revealing a perfect set of white teeth. “I think I might have left my car keys around here.” He crouched and scanned the floor. “Never mind. I must have imagined it.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1306:
Acting as though nothing bothered him, Blaine straightened and walked out, his steps measured as he finally exited Eastwood Manor. This time, he truly left for good. Even as he put distance between himself and the estate, the image of the manager sweating and trembling remained vivid in his mind. One thing was clear: Eastwood Manor was hiding far more than it let on.
Reaching his car parked at the curb, Blaine settled into the driver’s seat. A bodyguard approached the window, concern etched on his face. “Mr. Castro, what should we do next?”
Inside his car, Blaine’s usual confidence gave way to thoughtful concern. He turned to his bodyguard and said firmly, “Look into everything that manager told me. Verify the claims about the staff being dismissed and the supposed fire in the archives. I want real answers, not excuses.”
Nothing about the manager’s behavior had seemed right, and his nervous lies were painfully obvious. The way he stumbled through his story only convinced Blaine that something at Eastwood Manor was being concealed. He resolved not to rest until he uncovered every secret the estate held.
After a moment, Blaine added, “I’ll head down to the police station near Eastwood Mountain. Sutton died at that manor six months ago, so the case files should still exist.” He refused to believe that people could simply vanish without a trace.
His bodyguard gave a respectful nod. “Understood, Mr. Castro.”
With that, Blaine pressed the accelerator, and his sleek sports car roared down the winding mountain road.
Back at Eastwood Manor, another discreet black vehicle arrived without attracting attention. A tinted window slid down to reveal Beal, his expression unreadable and his eyes sharp as he watched the sports car disappear. Timing had worked in his favor. He had already secured the manager’s cooperation with a generous bribe and careful pressure. Without those preparations, today’s encounter could have spiraled out of control.
Most people dismissed Blaine as a wealthy playboy, but few could match his instincts. He had come perilously close to exposing the truth. For Beal, tying up every loose end had never felt more urgent.
At Myrtlewood Estate, Noah stepped through the door, weary from a long day at the office.
Sadie greeted him with silent determination and led him into the study, where she immediately turned the computer screen toward him. On the monitor lay files from her mother’s old USB drive—her life’s work laid bare.
A heavy silence descended as they absorbed the gravity of what they saw. This was data that could change everything. If those files fell into dangerous hands—especially a group like the Wolfpack—it would be catastrophic. Suddenly, Sadie understood the true cost of her mother’s sacrifices and secrecy. This wasn’t mere scientific research; it held the power to save or destroy countless lives.

Caught in a storm of worry and confusion, Sadie felt the weight of her mother’s struggle pressing down on her, remembering how fiercely that tiny fake pearl had been guarded. Noah reached out, warm fingers enclosing her cold ones. “Sadie, I’m right here with you,” he said gently, offering comfort amid the chaos.
Sadie nodded slowly, exhaustion and resolve mingling on her face. The silence in the study grew even heavier as they contemplated what was at stake.

###Chapter 1307:
Moments later, Samuel knocked and entered, smiling politely and standing with respectful posture. “Ms. Hudson, Mr. Wall,” he said smoothly, “preparations for the World Designers Summit are nearly complete. The event begins tomorrow.”
Sadie’s eyes widened in sudden realization. Of course—it was Wall Group’s annual global conference. With so much upheaval in her life, she had completely forgotten. Shaking off her anxious thoughts, she managed a grateful smile. “Thank you, Samuel. I’ll be ready.”
Noah glanced back at the intricate files on the screen, then returned his gaze to Sadie’s tired eyes. Hardship had shaped her over the years, and he admired her all the more for her strength.
He stepped closer, wrapping her in his arms and holding her tightly. “Sadie, you’ve done a remarkable job with the company these past years,” he said, warmth filling his voice.
Sadie relaxed into his embrace, comforted by the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.
Noah bent his head, brushing his nose against her hair and offering a gentle smile. “It looks like I’ll be depending on you from here on out, Ms.?Hudson.”
With a mischievous grin, Sadie pinched Noah’s arm in response to his teasing. “You really ought to be serious for once,” she said, though her laughter sparkled in her eyes.
Her amusement faded as a shadow of concern crossed her face, reopening an old worry. Lifting her gaze, she spoke softly, “Noah, about your memory…” The words slipped out before she could stop them, tinged with cautious hope.
Sensing the change in her mood, Noah pulled her closer, every trace of playfulness gone. His tone grew earnest as he met her eyes. “Sadie, you have nothing to fear. I’ll stay by your side. My memory is returning, little by little, and I won’t leave you behind again.”
Uncertainty lingered over how quickly his recovery would progress, but one thing was clear: he would not let her bear the burden alone. For a long moment, Sadie searched his steady gaze, seeing her own hope reflected there. Content, she nestled her head against his shoulder. That promise was all she needed.
On the morning of the World Designers Summit opening, Sadie and Noah arrived at the venue early. Every corner buzzed with excitement, laughter blending with the rich aroma of perfume to create a vibrant atmosphere. Renowned designers, prominent guests, and eager reporters filled the hall, lending the gathering an air of prestige.
Standing at the heart of it all, Sadie drew attention as both the leader of Wall Group and the face of the event’s organizing committee. Samuel hurried through the crowd to reach her. “Ms. Hudson, we’re almost ready. Please head backstage to prepare for the ribbon-cutting ceremony.”
A simple nod from Sadie showed she understood, and she turned toward Noah for reassurance. “I’ll head over now,” she said, her voice steady.
Your next journey starts at g?lnσνso
Noah offered her a soft nod, the warmth in his eyes unmistakable. Sadie followed Samuel as they headed backstage.
Noah drifted through the crowd, a glass of champagne in hand, exchanging polite nods and reserved smiles with acquaintances as he maintained his composure. Business etiquette came naturally to him, and his instincts for networking remained sharp even when his memory faltered.

###Chapter 1308:
Suddenly, a cheeky voice floated from behind. “Look who it is—Mr. Wall himself, working the room alone? Enjoying the fruits of your own empire?”
Without glancing back, Noah recognized the voice instantly. Blaine strolled over, carrying his drink and radiating his trademark easygoing charm, though the cleverness in his eyes never wavered. He took a quick survey of the elegant crowd, then grinned slyly. “Mr. Wall, need a wingman tonight? You’ve got half the socialites here watching your every move.”
Noah offered him a cold, detached look. Some things about Blaine never changed, and his teasing was certainly one of them.
Choosing not to respond to the banter, Noah dropped his voice to get straight to the point. “Did you learn anything new about Sutton?”
All playfulness slipped from Blaine’s face, replaced by a rare seriousness as he considered the question. He drew in closer, lowering his tone so only Noah could hear. “You know, the whole thing gets stranger the more I look at it,” he said, slowly swirling his champagne. “I’ve gone through those Eastwood Mountain police case files more times than I can count. There’s not a single clue. Everything looks perfectly normal.”
If Sutton’s death was just an accident or the result of a personal grudge, then every scrap of evidence seemed to support that narrative. Nothing was out of place. Nothing had been missed.
Blaine shook his head, a trace of sarcasm in his tone. “Eastwood Manor is a circus all its own. The manager could barely form a sentence—sweating bullets the entire time. Every employee who was on duty that day? Fired a month ago. Their personnel files? Magically destroyed in some freak fire.” He let out a dry laugh. “Rounding up everyone for proper questioning is going to be a slow process, I’m afraid.”
Someone had to be orchestrating things from the shadows, and they were moving with impressive speed. Noah listened closely, his eyes sharp with silent contemplation.
Blaine swept his gaze over the mingling guests before something caught his eye. He shot Noah a knowing glance. Amid the whirl of laughter and clinking glasses, a familiar silhouette emerged—moving gracefully, charming others with polite conversation and an easy smile.noveldrama
Noah followed Blaine’s gaze, a frown tugging at his brow as he recognized the newcomer. Alex had made an appearance. Questions formed instantly: what business did Alex have at this event? Across the crowded room their eyes met briefly. In response, Alex offered a flawless, practiced smile that revealed nothing.
Blaine lowered his voice, leaning in. “Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t recall sending an invitation to anyone from the Howe family,” he murmured, sarcasm lacing his words.

Alex advanced through the crowd, glass in hand, his expression untouched by Blaine’s taunt. His composure remained icy as he replied, “I came for Sadie, to see if there’s anything I could help with.”
Blaine bristled, squaring his shoulders and stepping subtly between Noah and Alex. “It almost sounds like you think Wall Group can’t handle its own affairs,” he challenged. “Noah is here for Sadie, and everything is under control, Mr. Howe.”
No care was spared for Alex’s dignity. To Blaine, Alex’s feelings for Sadie were hardly a secret, and that affected politeness— that pretense of genuine concern— grated on his nerves. Noah met Alex’s gaze with an indifferent calm, his voice smooth and steady. “Mr.?Howe, we have a busy program today. Please forgive us if we don’t give you our full attention.”

###Chapter 1309:
Though Noah’s reply sounded courteous, his true message was crystal clear: he had no intention of letting Alex linger. Alex’s sudden appearance reeked of hidden motives. Whether he sought to pry or simply draw Sadie’s attention, Noah saw through him. No matter his aim, Noah wouldn’t give him the chance to succeed.
A flicker of irritation crossed Alex’s eyes before he managed to keep his smile soft and charming. Just as he prepared to respond, another voice interrupted.
“Mr. Wall, your reputation truly speaks for itself. Now that I’ve met you, I can say it’s completely deserved.”
A thin, wiry man had slipped into their circle as if from thin air. His lips curved upward in a polite smile, but his eyes glinted with quiet cunning. Noah studied the newcomer, trying to place the face. He couldn’t recall meeting him before, yet that eager grin seemed forced—hiding its own motives.
Alex turned as well, curiosity momentarily piqued. Nothing about the stranger’s appearance stood out, yet something oddly familiar tugged at his memory—then slipped away before he could grasp it.
Deciding the newcomer was of little consequence, Alex dismissed him without acknowledgment and redirected his attention back to Noah and Sadie. Without wasting time on introductions, he simply walked away.
Humphrey watched Alex’s retreat, his smile widening beneath a chill in his eyes. “Alex,” he muttered to himself, “the real show hasn’t even started yet.” Plans he had set in motion were finally gaining momentum.
Alex, always so sure of himself, would soon discover just how quickly fortunes could change.noveldrama
Before long, the grand opening began. Sadie stepped forward as chairwoman of Wall Group and the face of the event, delivering a speech that balanced poise with inspiration. Brilliant lights bathed her in a soft glow, her white suit radiating crisp authority. Thunderous applause greeted her as she finished.
With the formalities complete, guests began to circulate and mingle. Welldressed executives gathered in animated clusters, the room alive with laughter, clinking glasses, and sharp business talk.
Samuel hurried over to Sadie, a folder in hand and concern etched on his face. “Ms. Hudson, I need your attention on this. It’s about our raw material supply for next quarter. Grand Building Materials, who we’ve worked with for years, pulled out just a few days ago. If we don’t find other suppliers soon, production will come to a halt.”
Sadie scanned the paperwork, her mind racing through possible scenarios. Grand Building Materials had never dropped the ball like this—especially not when the stakes were so high. Still, she maintained her composure and issued clear instructions. “Samuel, take the lead on this. Develop several backup options and report back to me immediately.”
Samuel gave a curt nod and hurried off to begin the task.

Sadie’s gaze drifted over the crowd as she hoped to spot Noah among the guests. While she had stood on stage, she had felt his encouragement, and now she longed for the comfort of his side.
Before she could weave through the throng, a young server approached with a polite bow. “Ms. Hudson, a gentleman outside is asking to speak with you.”
Sadie paused, considering the surprising message. Someone waiting for her?
.

###Chapter 1310:
Immediately, Noah came to mind. Perhaps something urgent had kept him from entering the hall. Brushing aside her questions, Sadie nodded to the server. “Show me where he is.”
He led her swiftly through a maze of corridors and stopped before a secluded lounge. With a small bow, he slipped away.
Sadie drew a slow, steadying breath, squared her shoulders, and pushed open the heavy wooden door. Inside, the room lay in deep shadow, the curtains drawn tight against the world beyond. A lone figure stood motionless at the window, back turned to her.
The faint creak of the door drew his attention. He turned slowly, candlelight glinting off a cool, silver mask that concealed most of his features. Only a pair of deep, unfathomable eyes met hers.
Shock pulsed through Sadie. Her heart thundered as suspicion tightened around her. She had never encountered anyone like him. The mask only deepened the mystery, and dread began to coil quietly in the back of her mind.
Sadie reminded herself that she was the host tonight and steadied her composure, refusing to let nerves take over. Offering a subtle nod, she kept her tone measured. “May I know your name, sir?”
The man’s movements were deliberate as he stepped into the faint pool of light. Dark, unreadable eyes peered out from behind the cold metallic mask.
“You must be Sadie, daughter of Brenda,” he said, his voice low and gravelly, each word pronounced with careful intent.
At the mention of her mother’s name, an icy shiver slid up Sadie’s spine and settled deep in her bones. The name Brenda rarely passed the lips of strangers, and hearing it from this masked man sent a spike of dread through her. Unease twisted in her chest, growing sharper by the second. An instinctive urge to step back seized her, but her legs refused to obey. In that moment, she realized this encounter carried real danger.noveldrama
Meanwhile, across the hall, Noah scanned the lively crowd, wine glass in hand, searching for Sadie’s familiar silhouette. Earlier, he had watched her handle business matters with confidence. A faint crease appeared in his brow as concern crept in. Amid the chaos and noise, one question haunted him: Was Sadie safe?
Noah set his glass on a nearby table and weaved through the bustling venue, eyes darting to every corner. He checked in with a handful of familiar faces, but none had seen her. With every vague answer, his worry deepened.
Eventually, a waiter who had noticed Noah’s anxious pacing approached him quietly. “Mr. Wall, are you searching for Ms. Hudson? I saw her walking toward the lounge area earlier.” He gestured toward a shadowed corridor at the rear of the banquet hall.
Without hesitation, Noah strode in that direction, urgency propelling him forward. One lounge after another, he opened door after door, finding only silence and empty rooms. The sense of dread settled in his chest and tightened with every step. Sadie’s whereabouts remained a troubling mystery.

Just then, Blaine appeared at his side, swirling a glass of champagne. He caught sight of Noah’s tense expression and remarked with concern, “You look rattled. Did you see a ghost or something?”

###Chapter 1311:
No trace of humor touched Noah’s reply. His voice was low and taut with worry. “Sadie’s missing. A waiter said she went toward the lounge area, but I can’t find her.”
Blaine’s usual lightheartedness vanished in an instant as he realized the gravity of the situation.
Understanding the gravity of the situation, Blaine nodded briskly. “Stay calm. I’ll get someone to pull the surveillance footage right away.” He wasted no time and moved swiftly to set things in motion. Noah remained frozen, anxiety twisting inside him as he waited for any word.
Within minutes, Blaine’s call came through, his voice heavy with concern. “Noah, you need to prepare yourself. Surveillance caught Sadie leaving with a masked stranger. He’s tall, intimidating, and they drove off in a black car with no plates, heading out of the city.” A masked stranger? That detail landed like a blow.
A deep frown cut across Noah’s face as icy dread crept up his spine. Every dark suspicion he’d harbored now seemed real, and the worstcase scenario stared him in the face. Thoughts raced, each more distressing than the last.
His phone buzzed just then, snapping him from his spiraling thoughts. On the screen was a text from an unknown sender:
“White Tiger from the Wolfpack is back in town. I just got the news. Stay alert.”
Beneath the words, a photo loaded onto the screen. Though the background was blurry, it looked like it had been snapped at an airport or station. A tall figure in a gleaming silver tiger mask dominated the frame, striding with powerful, purposeful steps. Even as only a silhouette and partial profile were visible, the image conveyed an unmistakably cold, commanding presence.
Noah’s eyes narrowed as he compared the masked figure in the photo with Blaine’s description from the surveillance. Every detail matched: the imposing build, the height, and that unmistakable mask. The man who had taken Sadie was the White Tiger himself.
The news hit hard. Sadie had fallen into the hands of the Wolfpack, a brutal syndicate notorious for its violence and instilling fear.
Fury surged within Noah, hot and uncontrollable.
His grip tightened around his phone, his knuckles whitening, veins straining with barely restrained rage.

No one touched Sadie and walked away unscathed.
There would be no mercy—not this time.
Every muscle in his body trembled with the urge to act.
How dare they?
The audacity of it left him shaking.
But then, memories of the surveillance footage crept in. Sadie had walked away willingly, her steps calm beside the masked stranger. For a split second, confusion replaced rage. What was really happening? Was there a connection between Sadie and the Wolfpack’s White Tiger, or had she been forced into this by circumstances he couldn’t yet understand?
Questions spun in his mind, but he forced himself to focus.noveldrama
Steadying his breath, Noah sent a quick message to the person who had sent him White Tiger’s photo: “White Tiger has Sadie.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1312:
With that, he locked his phone, his eyes turning cold and determined.
His voice cut through the tension. “Start searching now. Shut down every road out of Jazmah. Contact every authority. We need their full cooperation.”
Finding Sadie was the only priority.
According to the cameras, she and the masked man had left just twenty minutes earlier.
Acting quickly might still give him a chance to intercept them.
Restlessness churned inside him as he prepared to take charge of the search.
Just then, Alex shoved his way through the crowd, his eyes wild with panic as he grabbed Noah’s arm. “Where is Sadie? Tell me where she went!”
Noah’s patience snapped. He yanked his arm free, darkness flashing in his gaze. His fist rose, ready to deliver a brutal answer. “You don’t get to demand answers. Sadie is my wife.”
His blow landed hard, sending Alex reeling, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. Undeterred, Alex wiped the red away, eyes never leaving Noah’s. A gnawing worry told him something terrible had happened to Sadie.
Before either man could speak, a bodyguard burst in, visibly shaken. “Mr. Wall, we’ve got news. Security spotted the masked man heading for the airport. Mrs.?Wall was with him.”
Shock flickered in Noah’s eyes. The airport? What could they be planning for Sadie? There was no time for argument. Without a glance at Alex, Noah turned pale and rushed out. The word airport echoed in Alex’s mind, heavy with threat. Pain forgotten, he tore after Noah, mirroring his urgency.
Inside a sleek car speeding through the city streets, Sadie sat in tense silence beside the White Tiger. The air between them was thick and suffocating. Her fingers curled into her palms, nails biting her skin until a sharp sting cut through her fear.
Her voice shook but did not break. “What do you want in exchange for my parents’ ashes?”
Nothing mattered more. She would fight for their return to the end.
Behind his silver mask, the White Tiger’s mouth curved into a halfsmile, making him all the more chilling. “No need to worry, Ms. Hudson. We’ll arrive in Zupren soon, and everything will be explained there.”
Your story source g?lnσνs?com
Sadie clamped her teeth on her lower lip, swallowing the dread in her throat. Zupren—a country she had never set foot in. But there was no turning back now. Her parents’ ashes were her last connection to them.
Noah had sworn to help her bring them home, no matter the cost. If this was the chance she’d been waiting for, she would seize it. She would not let it slip away. Every second of helplessness gnawed at her, but for her parents’ sake, she pressed on.
The car raced down busy streets, its speed gradually easing as their destination drew near. Soon, the vehicle halted before a sprawling, elegant terminal. They had reached the airport.
White Tiger glanced at her, a flicker of amusement in his eyes behind the silver mask, and motioned for her to step out. Without hesitation, Sadie pushed open the door and stepped onto the pavement.noveldrama

###Chapter 1313:
Meanwhile, rushhour traffic turned the roads into a sea of brake lights, delaying Noah’s arrival by more than half an hour. When he finally emerged from his car, icy determination radiated from him, every line of his face carved with tension. Alex was close behind, rushing from another vehicle, pale and shaken.
“Noah, tell me what’s going on. Where’s Sadie?” Alex demanded.
Noah ignored him, his cold, cutting stare conveying a silent warning. Alex always seemed to appear at the worst possible moments, adding chaos to crisis. Noah refused to let anyone else handle this—Sadie was his responsibility.
Straightening his shoulders, he turned to his security team. “Start searching. Review every outgoing international flight. Do not miss a single suspicious passenger.”
Without delay, the bodyguards fanned out into the crowd.
Inside the terminal, energy crackled with frantic urgency. Voices echoed, luggage trolleys rattled past, and families hurried through the maze of gates. Noah stood rooted in place, anxiety twisting inside him until every breath felt tight and shallow.
Sadie, wherever you are, stay safe, he murmured under his breath.
Almost unconsciously, his eyes rose to the vaulted glass ceiling above, scanning the endless blue sky. A jet appeared, climbing higher with every second—its silver fuselage glinting in the sunlight, a contrail stretching behind it like a ribbon.
Noah’s eyes narrowed as his chest tightened. That plane was shrinking in the distance. Was she on it?
Noah and his team spent the entire day scouring every corner of the city, relentless in their pursuit.
Yet Sadie seemed to have dissolved into the air itself, as if she’d never existed at all.
An amber glow stretched across the sky as dusk swallowed the last rays of sunlight.
Back at Myrtlewood Estate, tension crackled in the study like an oncoming storm.
Not once did Noah’s tense expression soften; worry had taken up permanent residence on his face.
Explore more chapters on g?lnσνes?c?m
Restless, he stalked from wall to window, his silhouette drawn tall against the fading light.
Where could Sadie possibly be?
The stranger in the silver mask haunted his thoughts—who was he, really?
Why had Sadie been targeted in the first place? What was their motive? One question tumbled over another, pressing down until his chest felt tight.
Images of an airplane slicing through the clouds kept looping in his mind, each replay squeezing his heart with dread.
He refused to let his mind dwell on the worst-case scenario, terrified of what might become of Sadie.
Worry carved new lines into Blaine’s features too, stealing away his trademark easy grin.
He raked his fingers through his hair again and again, only to let his hands fall in helpless exasperation.
.

.noveldrama
###Chapter 1314:
Above all else, both men knew one truth: Sadie’s safety was all that mattered now.
If his grandfather heard about this, it would spell disaster for him. Events had tumbled out of control, slipping far from what he’d ever predicted.
Still, Alex’s convincing act had taken him off guard.
Shadowing them throughout the day, Alex played the role of the concerned ally, his anxious energy almost believable.
Had he not been aware of Alex’s hidden agendas, he might have mistaken that performance for genuine worry.
Only now had he managed to send Alex away with an excuse, finally creating some distance.
Deep down, Blaine questioned what Alex truly hoped to achieve by inserting himself into this crisis.
Just then, a sharp knock interrupted the study’s strained quiet.
A bodyguard rushed inside, perspiration glistening on his brow. He bent forward in respect, his voice tight and urgent. “Mr. Wall, Mr. Castro.”
Noah stopped mid-stride, eyes narrowing as he fixed a piercing stare on the newcomer.
Blaine’s gaze immediately shifted to the man as well. Drawing a bracing breath, the bodyguard delivered his update. “We’ve combed through everything at the airport. All commercial flights checked out, but right after Ms. Hudson vanished, a private jet departed—its destination was Zupren.”
Zupren!
The name alone made Noah’s knuckles whiten as he squeezed his fists tighter. Of course.
This was it.
That out-of-place plane he’d glimpsed earlier at the terminal wasn’t just a coincidence.
His worst fears had finally materialized.
Sadie had truly been whisked away to Zupren.
The best reads are at g?lnσνs?c?m
Anger flared in his eyes, but his tone stayed cold and precise. “Get everything ready. We’re heading to Zupren—now.” There was no universe where he’d abandon Sadie.
Whatever the cost, he would see her returned safely.
And those who dared to lay a hand on her would pay the ultimate price.
Noah turned, his intense eyes settling on Blaine.
“For now, I’m trusting you with the company. Keep me updated if anything happens here.”
Right now, Wall Group could wait—Sadie’s wellbeing eclipsed every other concern.noveldrama
All traces of Blaine’s usual easygoing attitude vanished as he gave a firm nod.
He grasped just how serious things had become, and he recognized the turmoil churning behind Noah’s stoic facade.

###Chapter 1315:
The weight of responsibility fell on his shoulders. “You can count on me, Noah.”
With a steady hand, he gave Noah’s shoulder a reassuring squeeze. “I’ll keep things running here. Your only job is to make sure Sadie comes back.”
Dawn in Zupren brought a sharp chill to the air.
As Noah descended from the plane, exhaustion dragged at his steps. Nearly twenty-four hours had passed without rest; crimson rimmed his eyes, and a fierce determination clung to his every movement.
Questions about Sadie’s condition haunted his every thought. As soon as he left the terminal, Noah slipped into the waiting black sedan idling near the curb.
Behind the wheel sat a man in a charcoal jacket, eyes sharp as he caught Noah’s entrance.
Hurst greeted him with a furrowed brow and a string of quiet sighs. “Dude, dropping in like this without warning isn’t a good idea.” Noah’s abrupt arrival had thrown a wrench into Hurst’s carefully laid plans, dragging unnecessary attention their way.
“You’re aware of the risks I’m taking. The Wolfpack has me embedded at their headquarters—I can’t keep making unexplained disappearances or they’ll catch on, and then we’ll both be in deep trouble.”
A nervous glance at the rearview mirror broke Hurst’s train of thought, his fingers drumming a subtle rhythm on the steering wheel. “I’ve been monitoring the area—White Tiger still hasn’t shown up.”
Noah didn’t so much as flinch at Hurst’s warnings.
Every thought was consumed by Sadie. He had pushed aside all concerns that didn’t lead directly to her.
Hurst muttered inwardly about his string of bad luck but managed to keep his face expressionless.
Noah’s sudden arrival left him unsettled.
Life as an undercover agent gave Hurst little room for comfort or mistakes.
Without a word, he switched on the engine, guiding the black sedan into the nearly empty morning streets.
gα?ησν?s?com, the place for amazing tales
His modest home sat tucked away in a neighborhood close to Wolfpack headquarters, chosen precisely for its privacy and anonymity.
Earlier, he had come up with a plan: for now, Noah would take on the role of his assistant, a move that would help him blend in and avoid suspicion.
Bringing along an unfamiliar person out of the blue would only invite trouble.
Noah studied Hurst in the shadowy car, his gaze sharp and unyielding.noveldrama
Noah seemed to hate the idea of pretending to be his assistant.
That stare rattled Hurst enough to make him clear his throat. “Mr. Wall, I had to act fast, so this was the best I could do. It’s safer than you going in by yourself.”
He knew Noah wasn’t someone he could risk upsetting. Given the circumstances, Hurst thought this plan was as good as any.
Trying to sound steady, Hurst continued, “Tomorrow, I’m heading to headquarters to give Afara a check-up. You’ll come with me then. Just remember, security is tight. We won’t have much freedom or time once we’re inside, so be ready for that.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1316:
Noah responded with a cold nod, then asked, “Afara?”
Every possible avenue to Sadie mattered to him, and he refused to leave any stone unturned.
“That’s right. The Wolfpack is run by three top dogs,” Hurst replied. “White Tiger is one. He’s dangerous and unpredictable. Afara is another. The third leader keeps their identity hidden. I managed to get into the Wolfpack’s headquarters because of Afara’s help.”
A touch of contempt crept into Hurst’s voice. “Afara loves attention, always putting himself out there. He has a reputation for chasing women, so he’s got problems in that area… Let’s just say, things are complicated.”
After a half hour’s drive, they reached a plain apartment building with nothing special about its exterior.
Upstairs, Hurst led Noah into a simple room and handed over the keys. Noah ignored the surroundings, his thoughts fixed on finding Sadie above all else.
Both of them spent a good amount of time poring over the steps they would take after entering the headquarters the next morning. They mapped out which paths looked safest and flagged corners where security cameras might catch them unaware.
Hurst could not let the warnings slip from his mind, so he kept repeating the same message—if anything started to go sideways, they had to leave at once. Reckless heroics had no place in their plan. Noah listened intently, memorizing every critical note. Despite that, the tension lingering across his forehead did not ease up.noveldrama
Soon, dawn crept into the sky, painting everything with the faint promise of a new day.
Hurst grabbed the black medical kit he had packed ahead of time and shot a look in Noah’s direction. “We should get moving. It’s time.” Without a word, Noah fell into step behind him and followed him out. Hardly a soul could be seen on the street at this hour.
Soon after, a black car pulled up without a sound, the absence of a license plate making it stand out all the more.
As the window slid down, a tough-looking face appeared, scarred and scowling.
His glare cut straight through Noah, cold and sharp as broken glass. “Dr. Lawson, who’s this?” His tone was rough, and the question hung in the air, heavy with suspicion.
Step into a new journey on .con
Noah knew at once that this man would not be easily convinced. Not missing a beat, Hurst offered a polite smile and strode up, fishing a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and holding it out.
“Morning, Damien. I brought this fellow along to help with Mr. Afara’s condition. His medical skills are top-notch.”
He spoke in a tone that was both deferential and earnest.
Damien Scott accepted the pack without lighting up. He rolled it in his hand for a moment and scratched at his bald head.
He continued studying Noah.
Something about this newcomer made Damien uneasy, though he could not say exactly what.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1317:
Noah’s body language sent out a clear warning to keep your distance, and the depth in his gaze seemed bottomless.
With that unsmiling face, he could have been a debt collector on a bad day.
Hurst, picking up on Damien’s wariness, felt a knot tighten in his chest and edged forward, slightly shielding Noah.
He slapped a hand firmly onto Noah’s shoulder and kept his smile steady.
“Don’t mind him, Damien. My friend has always looked serious—it runs in the family.”
Even Hurst realized how weak his own explanation sounded.
Clearly, Damien didn’t see Noah, supposedly Hurst’s assistant, as someone worth his attention.
Afara’s health was the most important thing; they had no room for delays.
Gesturing impatiently, he indicated for Hurst and Noah to enter the vehicle.
Quietly, Hurst released a pent-up breath of relief.
Yet the instant his eyes met Noah’s deep, unreadable gaze, dread crept up his spine.
There was no mistaking Noah’s intensity and power.
Hurst privately groaned—everyone around him was a proper handful, such a trial to attend to.
Obediently, the two men climbed into the backseat of the car.
Soft shadows filled the interior, obscuring their features.
From the front seat, Damien casually tossed back two dark blindfolds. Noah caught his effortlessly, inspected it briefly, and showed no reaction whatsoever. What exactly was this for?
Uneasy at Noah’s lack of compliance, Hurst quickly leaned over, whispering anxiously, “This is a mandatory rule. Anyone entering headquarters must wear it.”noveldrama
Without complying, they wouldn’t get past security today.
After a brief hesitation, Noah’s brows knitted slightly, but he eventually complied and secured the blindfold.
Dive into fiction with gα?ησν?s．com
Smooth fabric instantly shielded his penetrating gaze.
Glancing back through the rearview mirror, Damien scoffed quietly when he saw Noah’s compliance.
So much arrogance for someone who still had to follow the rules. Damien muttered under his breath about Noah’s exaggerated pride, acting like the world owed him a favor.
He turned the ignition, and the black sedan smoothly joined the flow of traffic.
Silence enveloped them, disturbed only by the quiet hum of the engine. About ten minutes passed, though time lost its shape under the darkness of the blindfolds.
Slowly, the car came to a gentle halt.
“We’re here,” Damien said, his rough voice shattering the silence.
Prompted, Noah and Hurst removed their blindfolds.
.

###Chapter 1318:
Dawn was still creeping across the sky, tinting it with shades of pale gray.
Swiftly, Noah took in his surroundings.
It was an isolated suburban area, marked only by a solitary white lighthouse standing oddly alone in the distance, with no other building in sight.
The emptiness felt strangely excessive.
Where exactly was this headquarters? Could Wolfpack really have chosen such a desolate location?
Understanding Noah’s confusion, Hurst silently gestured toward the lighthouse.
Noah followed his indication, his frown deepening.
A lighthouse as headquarters—that was certainly peculiar.
Without further inquiry, Noah pushed the car door open and stepped onto the ground.
The chill of early morning air brushed against his face, carrying the scent of damp plants.
“Move faster,” Damien snapped impatiently, leading them toward the structure.
With Damien ahead, the trio approached and entered the lighthouse. Inside, shadows deepened further, and the stale scent of old metal filled the enclosed space.
Standing prominently at the center was a worn-out elevator. Damien stepped toward it, swiftly tapping a hidden sequence into a discreetly placed panel.
A gentle beep sounded, prompting the heavy metal doors to glide open quietly.
With an unruffled gaze, Noah absorbed every minute detail.
Clearly, the Wolfpack left nothing to chance—their base lay deep underground.
It was so secretive. No wonder they were hard to find.noveldrama
One after another, the trio entered the lift.
With a firm press, Damien selected the deepest underground floor. Silently, the elevator began descending, the faint metallic hum echoing softly within the confined space.

They lost track of how long they’d traveled downward before the elevator finally halted.
Slowly, the doors parted again.
A scene entirely unlike the bleak lighthouse unfolded before their eyes. Loud, pounding music surged toward them, mingling with lively laughter and the cheerful clink of glasses.
It felt as though they’d stepped directly into an extravagant world of pleasure, completely different from the barren suburb above.
Discomfort washed over Noah immediately.
Several glamorous women, dazzling in vibrant attire, quickly noticed the newcomers—Noah, in particular, caught their eager eyes.
Drawn like moths to a flame, they crowded around him, breathing softly with captivating smiles.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1319:
“Oh goodness! Where did you come from, handsome? I’ve never seen you here before.”
“Absolutely! Come, have a drink with me. I promise you’ll enjoy yourself.”
The blatant excitement in their eyes was unmistakable.
It had certainly been ages since such a striking man appeared among them.
With his impressive height, handsome but aloof features, and commanding presence, he stood out effortlessly.
Noah’s expression darkened considerably at the spectacle.
Their overly eager advances triggered clear irritation and disgust in his eyes.
Someone might mistake this place for a gaudy criminal underworld.
Was this truly the environment where Sadie had been taken? Imagining Sadie trapped amid this chaotic scene caused Noah’s icy demeanor to grow even colder.
Hurst, standing nervously nearby, felt his pulse quicken.
He genuinely worried Noah might snap and disrupt their delicate plans today.
Quickly, he stepped forward, wearing a practiced diplomatic smile, gently shooing away the eager women.
“Apologies, ladies, but Mr. Afara is expecting us. Please excuse us.” Disappointment visibly dimmed the women’s eagerness at his words.
Yet, they all understood that Afara’s needs took priority.
No matter how tempted by Noah’s charm, they knew Afara’s health came first.
Reluctantly, they made way, though their eyes lingered on Noah.
Hurst subtly wiped the sweat from his forehead, hastening to lead Noah further inside.
Passing through the rowdy outer area, they soon reached an ornate door leading into a private room.
A sliver of space revealed the relaxed laughter and chatter coming from within.
Summoning his nerve, Hurst pushed the door wide.
Fresh chapters live g?lnσνe?s?c?m
Sprawled lazily upon a large leather sofa was a man wearing an extravagant pink suit.
With two alluringly dressed women draped on either side, he smiled indulgently, a portrait of unrestrained excess.
This, unmistakably, was Afara—one of the Wolfpack’s three highest-ranking leaders.noveldrama
Afara caught sight of the visitors, his gaze settling curiously on Noah for a brief second before he casually released the women beside him and rose unsteadily to his feet.
“Ah, Dr. Lawson, finally you’re here.” A lazy, intrigued smirk crossed his features as he studied Noah openly, curiosity flickering in his eyes. “And who is this intriguing fellow? Is this the special assistant you spoke so highly of yesterday?”
He continued eyeing Noah up and down, clearly fascinated.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1320:
Hurst quickly nodded, forcing a respectful smile. “Mr. Afara, my friend here might seem reserved, but his skill is unmatched.”
From the moment Noah entered the Wolfpack’s lair, he had discreetly mapped out every corner in his mind.
Alert bodyguards hovered around every corner, their watchful eyes tracking every movement in this place.
Imagining Sadie trapped among these wolves twisted Noah’s heart with a chilling fury.
The anxiety and anger in Noah’s heart were almost impossible to suppress.
Noah concealed the coldness in his eyes and spoke up, his voice as sharp as ice. “Mr. Afara, we’re wasting time. Let’s start the treatment immediately. But I require absolute silence to concentrate.”
At this abrupt request, Afara’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully as he considered Noah’s words carefully.
Finally, with a lazy flick of his hand, he ordered casually to the room, “Everyone out. Nobody comes back unless I personally allow it.” The provocatively dressed women and several assistants quietly withdrew, knowing better than to question his command.
The heavy door shut firmly, instantly muffling the revelry outside.
Only then did Afara lazily return to his seat, sinking comfortably onto the plush sofa. He tilted his head toward Noah, gesturing loosely. “Proceed whenever you’re ready, Dr. Lawson, and your… reserved assistant.”
Without betraying any emotion, Noah stepped toward Afara, setting the black medical case on the table and flipping it open.
From within, he removed a gleaming scalpel, its blade thin and precise, reflecting Noah’s steady resolve.
Holding the scalpel loosely but deliberately, he approached Afara step by steady step.
Nearby, Hurst stood rigid, anxiety quickening his heartbeat and slicking his palms with sweat.
Noah’s manner wasn’t that of a healer—it seemed more like an assassin closing in on prey.

Struggling to control his nervousness, Hurst quickly grabbed a pair of surgical clamps, gripping them tightly as if preparing for trouble.
Just in case… if violence erupted between Noah and Afara, he needed to intervene.
Without warning, before Afara could even blink, Noah had positioned the sharp scalpel firmly against his chest.
The blade tip pressed lightly, indenting the fabric over Afara’s heart. Afara instantly felt the cold threat pressing against him, his posture becoming rigidly alert.
He raised his eyes, and the playful air vanished instantly.
Now his gaze was piercing, carrying a ruthless intensity that seemed bottomless.
A slow smirk crept onto his face, and all warmth drained from his voice. “You’re quite daring, aren’t you?”

###Chapter XXX:
Noah met his gaze head-on, his own eyes turning bitterly cold, radiating the same amount of hostility.
His mouth opened slowly, releasing a question sharper than steel.
“Where did you take my wife?”
Afara’s smile widened knowingly at that question.
His amused laughter echoed mockingly as he casually crossed his legs, thoroughly relaxed in the face of danger.
Raising his hands in mock innocence, he drawled tauntingly, “I’ve got plenty of lovely ladies around here. How am I supposed to guess who you mean? Tell you what, just pick any woman you fancy, and I’ll gladly hand her over.”
Before Afara could finish speaking, a sharp pain shot through his arm. Noah had flicked his wrist, and the scalpel in his hand had sliced clean through the pink suit’s sleeve, carving a thin line of blood across Afara’s arm.
The fabric darkened as blood seeped through.
Afara winced. The grin on his face slipped, twisting into something ugly.
His eyes narrowed, cold and furious.
He hadn’t expected Hurst’s assistant to actually strike.
It had been a while since anyone dared. And this one—so reckless, so bold—was worth remembering.
With a flicker of madness in his eye, Afara gripped the blade pressed against his chest. His palm split open.
Blood spilled freely, dripping down the steel.
Hurst froze, horror surging up his throat.
They were finished.
Without thinking, he raised the pair of surgical clamps and slammed them down onto Afara’s temple with everything he had.
“Bang!”
Read exclusive content at g?lnσνs?com
Afara didn’t even scream.
His eyes rolled back. A jolt of pain bloomed across his skull. Then, silence. He collapsed onto the sofa. Still. Unmoving.
Blood trickled down the side of his face.
Hurst stood frozen, stunned and breathless.
That was it. Game over.noveldrama
The guards outside would never let this go. Knocking Afara out was a death sentence.
They might as well have signed up for a one-way trip to hell.
Noah turned and shot him a look.
Hurst went still. His lips clamped shut.
Noah was terrifying.
Hurst was already regretting everything, questioning why he had ever agreed to help Noah in the first place.

###Chapter XXX:
Twenty minutes crawled by. The throb in Afara’s temple finally dragged him back.
He let out a low groan, forcing his eyes open.
That bastard really knew how to swing.
Afara tried to lift a hand to his forehead, but his limbs wouldn’t budge. Both wrists and ankles were bound tight.
He let out a low chuckle and glanced at the two men lounging across the room on a leather sofa.
“Tie me up all you want. You’ll never find the one you’re after,” he said with a light, mocking tone, as if he had nothing to fear at all. “Besides, you’re not exactly in a safe spot either,” Afara added.
Noah’s expression darkened.
He didn’t have time for this.
Sadie had been gone for nearly twenty-four hours. Every second that ticked by chipped away at the odds of finding her safe. He had run out of patience.
“Maybe we’re in danger. Maybe you’re the one about to die,” said Noah. “Either way, you’ll be the first to fall.” The smirk slid from Afara’s face.
He went quiet.
There was something about Noah—unpredictable, unhinged.
“Where’s White Tiger?” Noah asked.
Afara shrugged. The ropes restricted his movement, but the sarcasm in his posture remained.
“No clue. White Tiger’s always with the boss. Honestly, he’s kind of dull.”
Noah stared at him, gaze sharp enough to cut through lies.
Afara didn’t flinch. He didn’t look like he was bluffing.
“How do you contact them?” Noah asked.
Afara paused, then answered, “We don’t, really. Not unless something serious happens here. But man—”

He didn’t get to finish. Noah had already lost patience with his ramblings. He had no time to waste.
He turned to Hurst, his voice cold.
“Burn it down,” he ordered, his tone final.
Was this some kind of joke?
Afara’s eyes widened in stunned confusion.
He couldn’t believe what he’d just heard.
He couldn’t help wondering if Noah had completely lost his mind.
Hurst had the same thought.noveldrama
Setting the place ablaze would be the same as daring the Wolfpack to open war.
Noah offered no explanation as he simply watched Hurst with an unblinking, frostbitten stare.
For a few seconds, Hurst just stood there, uncertain, before finally letting his head fall in resignation.

###Chapter 1323:
He almost laughed at himself, wondering if he’d racked up some cosmic debt to Noah in another life and was now being forced to pay it back.
Meanwhile, on the western side, a lavish manor rested on perfectly groomed lawns.
A sleek black car rolled to a gentle halt at the drive.
Once the door swung open, Sadie climbed out, her composure perfectly intact.
She glanced at her companion, White Tiger, who hadn’t spoken a word the entire trip.
“Is the person I need to meet inside?” she asked, her tone even.
White Tiger offered the barest of nods, his respectful silence almost tangible.
“You must be exhausted from your travels. Let me have someone take you to a room to freshen up first,” he offered, gesturing politely. Two maids in polished uniforms stepped forward, heads bowed in greeting.
What the heck was happening here?
Sadie found herself in the bizarre position of being both a captive and an honored guest. What exactly was this group planning?
Even as uncertainty tugged at her, Sadie hid her suspicions behind a polite nod and followed the maids into the estate.
She resolved, right then, to get to the bottom of whatever game they were playing.
Crossing the threshold of the manor, she couldn’t help but notice the extravagant touches everywhere, with each piece of furniture and sparkling fixture shouting wealth and refinement.
Yet, as Sadie continued through the grand halls, an odd sense of recognition crept in.
Every detail—the sweeping spiral staircase, the dazzling crystal chandelier overhead, and the Impressionist painting adorning the wall—seemed eerily familiar.
Suddenly, it struck her: this was a perfect copy of Faron Retreat.
She could hardly believe it. How was such a thing possible?
Your favorite tales live at g?lnσν?s．
Still, Sadie kept her expression unreadable, trailing after the maids as they led her into a grand guest room.
She allowed them to prepare a hot bath and set out fresh clothes, saying nothing, but quietly watching every move they made. After the bath, Sadie stood in front of the mirror, a small frown pinching her brow.
The dress the maids had chosen, a soft lavender piece, vintage in style and elegantly tailored, looked like something straight out of another decade.
It reminded her so much of the outfits her mother’s generation had once cherished. If she wasn’t mistaken, this dress was even from her mother’s favorite designer brand.noveldrama
A soft voice interrupted her thoughts. “Ma’am, you look so much like your mother,” one of the maids, the elder one, said, studying Sadie’s reflection with gentle admiration.
A flash of ice settled in Sadie’s eyes as she locked stares with the maid through the mirror.
.

###Chapter 1324:
How did she know her mother?
A wave of fear swept over Sadie, tightening in her chest.
Something about this place didn’t add up.
She mentally warned herself to tread carefully from here on out. Turning her attention back to the task at hand, Sadie steadied her voice and asked, “So, where is this person I’m supposed to meet?”
The maid, thrown off by Sadie’s chilly stare, bowed her head and replied, “Please wait just a moment, Ms. Hudson. Mr. White Tiger has gone to get Mr. Emerson Stewart.”
So Emerson Stewart was the name behind all the mystery the White Tiger had hinted at.
That gave Sadie all the more reason to sit tight and observe.
Settling onto the plush sofa, she deliberately emptied her mind, keeping her senses sharp.
The two maids moved quickly and quietly, laying out an array of beautifully plated food, treating Sadie as though she were some honored guest.
After about 20 minutes, the door finally swung open.
In strode a man who looked a little rough around the edges, with dark stubble on his jaw, yet there was an undeniable charm about him.
Clothed in relaxed, dark casual wear, he gave off the air of an approachable neighbor rather than someone tied to the notorious Wolfpack.
For a moment, Sadie was so taken aback that she forgot to say a word. Something about this man sparked a strange sense of recognition in her.
How could that be?
Emerson crossed the room, eyes brimming with emotion as he studied Sadie’s face.
The resemblance to Brenda was almost overwhelming.
He awkwardly brushed away a hint of tears.
Endless adventures await on gα?ησν?s?com
“Was your trip here alright, sweetheart?” His voice was gentle, almost fatherly.
“You must be starving. I wasn’t sure what you liked, so I asked the kitchen to make all of your mother’s favorite dishes. Have a taste and see if any of them suits you.”
With a kind, open-handed gesture, Emerson invited Sadie to the table. Sadie stood rooted in place, feeling more unsettled by his kindness than she ever would by a threat.
Just a short while ago, she’d been busy running through every possible negotiation tactic she could think of, bracing herself for threats and mind games.
She never once imagined she’d walk into something this sentimental. Was this some kind of tactic? An appeal to her emotions?
She bit down on her lip, and though her heart pounded with suspicion, she found herself stepping closer to him.
Her guard never dropped; her eyes narrowed as she looked up.
“What is it you actually want from me?” she asked, her tone steely. “We’re strangers, Mr. Stewart. Stop dancing around and just say what you’re after.”

###Chapter 1325:
A look of disappointment flickered across Emerson’s face.
Even the way Sadie held herself, the stubborn tilt of her chin, reminded him of Brenda.
Without another word, Emerson settled himself at the table.
“We’ll get to business soon enough, but first, you should eat,” he insisted, his tone warm but unyielding. “Young people need to look after themselves. Don’t follow your mother’s example. She worked herself to exhaustion and always put her own well-being last.” As he spoke, Emerson lifted a serving spoon and gently placed a helping of perfectly grilled pork ribs on the plate set out for Sadie.
Sadie’s footsteps faltered. She was caught off guard.
How could he possibly know that her mother’s health had suffered from overwork? Or that grilled pork ribs had always been her favorite?
Still, Sadie crossed the room, her tone taking on a sharper edge.noveldrama
“Did you know my mother well? And where are my parents’ ashes? Give them to me. Now!”
Emerson stilled for a heartbeat but continued to dish out the food, his manner patient.
“Be patient. Eat something first. Once we’re finished, I’ll take you to your mother.”
Uncertainty and curiosity flickered across Sadie’s face as she studied Emerson.
At first, she considered insisting they skip the meal and get straight to the point, but just then, her stomach betrayed her, rumbling loudly in the silent room.
A flush of embarrassment crept up her cheeks, giving away her discomfort.
Changing tactics, she decided she might as well play along for now and see what this mysterious man intended.
With clear reluctance, Sadie picked up the utensils and began to eat. Two bites in, though, she found she couldn’t force herself to swallow another mouthful.
With a decisive gesture, she set her knife and fork back on the table, the sound echoing her resolve.
Her gaze turned steely as she met Emerson’s eyes. “Lead the way.” Whatever game he was playing, Sadie knew she had to remain alert, her guard never dropping for a moment.
gα?ησν?s?com is where imagination thrives
Emerson took one look at her barely touched plate, then quietly put his own utensils aside as well.
A weary sigh escaped him. “Young people are always so hasty—it’s not good to rush things like this.”
Despite his mild chiding, the moment he caught Sadie’s restless gaze, he yielded.
He got up, a flicker of tenderness passing through his expression. “Alright. Follow me.”
They started toward the door, but halfway there, Emerson paused abruptly.
He pivoted, his tall frame cutting off most of the doorway’s light. A complicated look crossed his features as he asked, “Sadie, how old are you now? Do you have any children?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1326:
The question caught Sadie off guard. Her brows knitted together in confusion.
What kind of criminal mastermind cared about her personal life? Since when did a notorious crime boss worry about something as ordinary as whether or not she had kids?
The idea was almost comical.
Reading her suspicion, Emerson paused, an unexpected sorrow flickering in his eyes. For a moment, they shimmered with tears. He said nothing more, simply pushed open the door, and motioned for her to go through.
After twenty minutes had passed, Emerson guided Sadie along winding paths lined with perfectly pruned flowers, eventually halting outside a secluded area set apart from the rest of the estate.
Inside, the space was warm and inviting, like a bedroom filled with gentle lamplight and the faint scent of flowers.
Sadie’s eyes swept across the room, finally coming to rest on a photo frame sitting atop the nightstand.
Inside the frame was a photograph of a much younger Emerson with her mother. Her mother was beaming up at him, every bit the image of someone deeply and effortlessly in love.noveldrama
There was no caution in her mother’s eyes, only adoration.
A wave of shock crashed through Sadie, leaving her frozen and numb. With trembling hands, she approached the nightstand, picked up the picture, and stared at it as her voice shook. “What… what were you to my mother?”
Emerson chose not to reply. Instead, he moved across the room in silence, stopping in front of a shrine where he struck a match and lit a single candle.
Sadie’s gaze drifted to an elegant white jade urn placed at the center of the shrine.
Etched across its surface were the words: “Here rests the love of my life, Brenda Stewart.”
What?
Sadie’s thoughts spiraled into chaos. Her brain simply refused to process what she was seeing.
g ? ln σ ν s?com, your fiction escape
None of this made sense. How could her mother possibly have been in love with Emerson?
Red-rimmed eyes glistening, Emerson’s hand hovered over the smooth urn. He spoke softly, each word weighed down by longing. “Brenda, our daughter is here. Can you see her?”
Every movement radiated a gentle reverence, as if he were still reaching for a love he’d never let go.
Sadie instinctively took a step back, her mind whirling with confusion, wild suspicions crowding out reason.
Suddenly, she surged forward, seizing Emerson’s arm and refusing to let go. “Who are you? What is all this? I want the truth, now!”
Kindness is never handed out for free. People don’t just help others out of the blue. Unless—

###Chapter 1327:
A chilling thought burst into her consciousness, threatening to swallow her whole.
Refusing to believe it, Sadie dropped her eyes and shook her head, desperate to chase the idea away.
No, there was no way. It couldn’t be true!
Emerson caught sight of her ashen face, concern etched in every line.
He reached out, meaning to gently tousle her hair.
“My dear, I am your biological father.”
The words slammed into Sadie, knocking the wind out of her last hope. Without thinking, she stepped back, smacking Emerson’s hand away. “Don’t lie to me! My father is Dederick Hudson. The only father I’ve ever known. You can’t possibly be him!”
A weary sigh escaped Emerson as he let his hand fall, resignation heavy in his voice. “Sadie, please, just hear me out. The truth is complicated, and I don’t expect you to accept it right away. But I am your father, whether you believe it or not.”
He fell silent for a moment, his eyes growing distant as memories surfaced.
“Your mother played a vital role at NE’s main office in Zupren,” Emerson began quietly. “Back then, the Wolfpack worked closely with NE, and she was the bridge between the two groups. As we spent more time together, friendship turned into love. But then everything fell apart. NE collapsed almost overnight, and the Lawson family, who backed NE, faced disaster. It hit your mother hard. She broke all contact, cut me out of her life, and returned home alone. Not long after, word reached me that she was marrying into the Hudson family. I had no idea she was carrying you. I just assumed Brenda wanted nothing more to do with me, so I let her go.” He paused, sorrow pressing into each word. “The last I ever heard of her was five years ago, a brief message about her death. I couldn’t accept it, so I went to bring her ashes here. I found a child’s toy near her urn, and that was how I finally learned you existed.”
Emerson’s words caught in his throat, his voice growing thick with emotion.
“Sadie, I’m sorry. I should have found you sooner.”
Hesitantly, he reached out and set his hand on Sadie’s shoulder, longing to offer comfort.
Sadie’s brow furrowed as she processed his story.
gα?ησνs?com has your next chapter
Listening to Emerson, she almost wanted to believe he was simply a heartbroken man who’d been left in the dark all these years.
But none of it matched the image she had of her mother, a woman far too practical, never the type to lose herself in a romance.noveldrama
And why had her mother hidden her existence for seventeen years, never once telling Emerson about her?
Sadie’s thoughts circled back to the exclusive patent issue she already knew about.
Whatever this was, Sadie felt it was less of a long-awaited reunion and more like a carefully orchestrated scheme.
Chaos churned inside Sadie’s mind, leaving her overwhelmed. She hadn’t even begun to process everything when the door flew open with a bang.
White Tiger burst in, sweat beading on his brow, his frantic energy completely at odds with the calm room.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1328:
“Emerson, there’s trouble. Afara’s in danger.” His words tumbled out before he even registered Sadie’s presence, and as soon as he saw her, he froze in place.
A sharp look from Emerson cut through the tension.
“Is this how you present yourself? Explain what’s happening.”
White Tiger dropped his gaze, his voice dropping to a whisper. “Our team reported a fire at the lighthouse. Afara… he’s trapped inside.” He hesitated, searching for the right way to break the news.
“We reviewed the security feed. Just before the fire started, Dr. Hurst Lawson brought someone into the building. He—”
He faltered, casting a wary glance in Sadie’s direction.
Sadie turned her head toward him, anxiety twisting in her chest as a wave of dread swept over her.
Finally, White Tiger forced out the words, his voice barely above a whisper. “It was… it was Noah Wall.”
The news crashed through Sadie’s thoughts like a thunderclap, scattering any semblance of calm.
Sadie’s fists curled so tightly that her nails bit into her skin.
Without thinking, she blurted out, “You can’t hurt him!”
Emerson caught sight of her daughter’s ashen face and exhaled softly, almost too quietly to hear.
“Sadie, try to stay calm. I’ve already had my people investigate Noah. Frankly, he’s no prize, especially considering the way he treated you.”
Before he could finish, Sadie cut him off, her voice steely and cold.
“He’s still more of a man than you’ll ever be.” Defiance flashed in Sadie’s eyes as she leveled him with a glare.noveldrama
Without waiting for a reply, she pivoted toward the door.
Emerson threw a silent signal to White Tiger.
Catching on instantly, White Tiger stepped forward, his broad shoulders blocking Sadie’s escape.
Sadie skidded to a stop, surprise flickering across her face.
She turned back, her icy stare locked on Emerson. “What is it you’re trying to do?”
Emerson’s patience didn’t falter. Instead, he looked at her with the weary understanding of a father.
“Sadie, you need to stay here,” he instructed, his tone gentle but firm. “Listen to me for once. White Tiger will go and see what’s happening. You heard the report. It’s far too dangerous for you. Wait here for any updates.”
Sadie’s lips parted, but before she could argue, White Tiger bowed at Emerson’s command and slipped out, closing the door behind him.
The soft click of the latch told Sadie all she needed to know.
Sadie realized, with a sinking heart, that escape was off the table. Emerson approached quietly, laying a steadying hand on Sadie’s trembling shoulder.
“If you insist on staying with Noah…”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1329:
Sadie cut him off, her patience gone, and her voice sharp.
“You don’t get to tell me what to do. Dederick Hudson is my father. You and I, there’s nothing between us. Don’t think you can use me for your own gain.”
Fire burned in her eyes as she glared up at Emerson.noveldrama
“And if something happens to Noah, you can forget about seeing me alive, too.”
Sadie shrugged off Emerson’s hand, putting distance between them with a single, decisive move.
Without sparing him a backward glance, she strode toward the far end of the room.
Emerson’s arm lingered in the air, his eyes swirling with regret and sorrow.
He turned away at last, letting his gaze settle once again on Brenda’s urn, lost in memories.
Shadows gathered on his face as the gentle father vanished, leaving only a steely hunger for dominance.
“Brenda, your spirit lives on in her. The same unyielding pride, that willingness to die in honor rather than live in disgrace. Still, I know she’ll fall in line eventually. You and Sadie share that overwhelming capacity for feeling.”
Time ticked away, nearly an hour slipping past in restless silence. Sadie couldn’t sit still as she paced the vast living room, her brow knitted with worry. Where was the update?
Why hadn’t anyone brought word yet?
And why had Noah suddenly appeared, especially alongside Hurst? Then it clicked. She remembered Noah mentioning something recently about sending Hurst on an urgent mission.
That must have been it. Noah had orchestrated an infiltration of the Wolfpack.
Typical of him, Sadie thought bitterly. He never hesitated to take risks, always shielding her from the details.
Her restless gaze fell on Emerson, who lounged on the sofa, coffee cup in hand, projecting utter calm.
How could Emerson be so unfazed when his friend was fighting for his life in a burning building?
Explore fresh updates on g?lnσνes?com
It was clear—Emerson’s heart was as cold as ice.
Emerson’s fatherly feelings, Sadie suspected, were nothing more than an act.
Just then, a bodyguard in a crisp black suit burst into the room. Sadie didn’t hesitate. She darted forward and seized his arm, desperation in her voice.
“Tell me! What’s happening? Where are they?”
Her urgent grip startled the man, making him freeze, words caught in his throat.
Emerson finally put his cup aside and rose from his seat. “She’s my daughter. Give her the report.”
Sadie shot him a sharp look.
His daughter?
The words made her snap, but she had no time for arguments now.
Only then did the bodyguard manage to stammer out his reply. “Noah and his companion got Mr. Afara out. They’ve already left in a car. Mr. Afara is with them, so we didn’t dare act rashly.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1330:
Relief flooded through Sadie. They were safe.
The tension in Sadie’s body melted away, her legs almost buckling beneath her.
Emerson turned to the guard, issuing a quiet order. “Shadow their car. Don’t interfere unless absolutely necessary.”
The bodyguard didn’t hesitate. “Understood, sir,” he replied, before hurrying out.
Unless absolutely necessary?
That phrase sent another jolt of anxiety racing through Sadie’s chest.
Fear and anger surged as she spun on Emerson. “What are you planning now? Afara is supposed to be your friend. Don’t you care what happens to him? Don’t you care about anyone’s safety?”
For a split second, a flicker of pain crossed Emerson’s face, almost too quick to catch.
“Sadie, how could you think that of your own father? Trust me, I know those people won’t lay a finger on Noah. I only want everyone brought here safely,” he replied, but the gentleness in his tone felt oddly off.
“Besides, I also want to meet your husband.”
His expression softened, but his words took on an unsettling edge. “Oh, and I heard you sent your son and mother-in-law to Zupren. Would you like me to arrange for them to join us here? We could have a real family reunion.”
Sadie’s insides turned to ice as the threat landed.
She saw straight through Emerson. This was nothing but a ploy to collect more leverage over her.
Anger left her shaking, her lips pressed in a thin line, unable to get a word out.
At last, the mask slipped from Emerson’s face.
He heaved a sigh, his voice flat and cold. “Relax, Sadie. No one’s in danger, as long as you give me what I want.”
Of course!
Your new favorite is gα?ησν?s?c?m
All that so-called fatherly affection had been nothing but a carefully crafted performance.
At last, Emerson stopped pretending and revealed his true intentions.
He’d clearly been waiting for this moment.
Sadie’s lips curled into a mocking smile as she locked eyes with him. “I have no idea what you’re after. But before you do anything rash, remember this: if something happens to Noah or me in Zupren, the Wall Group won’t rest until you pay.”
Emerson’s expression hardened, the warmth draining from his face. A quiet sigh escaped him, as if surrendering to his own exhaustion.
“Bring her back to her room,” he ordered, his voice turning cold and clipped. “No one is to let her out without my direct permission.”
On cue, several men with tattooed forearms filed in from the hallway. They radiated intimidation, though they still showed a rough sort of deference as they motioned for Sadie to go with them.

###Chapter 1331:
Without a word, Sadie shot Emerson a frosty glare and walked past him, falling in line with her escorts.
There was nothing left to say. The threat hung heavy in the air, and further arguments were pointless.
There was no mistaking Emerson’s motive. He was after the things her mother had left behind.
Sadie’s thoughts raced. She needed a plan, and she needed it fast. Their footsteps echoed in the long, shadowed corridor, filling the otherwise still silence.
At regular intervals, guards stood watch, their eyes missing nothing as she passed by.
Where exactly was she?
She tried to orient herself, but everything was unfamiliar.
The Wolfpack’s reputation for secrecy wasn’t exaggerated. This stronghold was masterfully hidden.
Discreetly, Sadie took in every detail of her surroundings.
Despite the lavish decor, an unmistakable feeling of oppressive confinement hung in the air.
Beyond the manor, not a single other building seemed to exist. A glance through the window at the corridor’s end revealed a bleak area to the north—just open, empty land. Could that direction hold an escape route?
After a tense walk that felt like an eternity, Sadie’s escorts finally paused before a door.
One of the men swung it open and signaled for her to step inside.
Sadie complied, her face unreadable.
Once inside the room, she patted herself down.
Nothing.
Her phone was missing.
Discover what’s next on g?lnσνsonoveldrama
Alarm rising, Sadie turned around and fixed her gaze on the two guards now stationed outside her door. “Where are my belongings?”
The two men, covered in ink, shared a brief look before one answered, “Mr. Stewart ordered you can’t contact the outside for now. If you need a phone, you’ll have to use one of ours. Internal lines only.”
So that was it.
Total isolation. She was a prisoner in all but name.
Fury flared in Sadie’s chest, her breaths coming hard and fast.
“Leave. Now.” Her words cut through the air, icy and absolute. “And for the record, I’m not your boss’ daughter. My family name is Hudson.”
The two guards didn’t linger. They simply gave Sadie a curt nod and stepped out, shutting the door behind them.
The sharp click of the lock echoed through the room, making Sadie’s anger burn even hotter.
She stormed over to the window and shoved at it with all her strength.
.

###Chapter 1332:
But the frame wouldn’t budge. It had been sealed tight.
As she frantically searched for options, her eyes landed on a blue porcelain vase perched on the nightstand.
To get what he wanted, Emerson wouldn’t let her die. So, if she was injured, he’d make sure she got medical attention.
That slim hope might be her only way out.
Driven by desperation, Sadie made up her mind to take a risk.
Moving toward the vase, she picked it up.
She gripped the vase, the chill of the ceramic steadying her nerves.
With a deep breath, she smashed it hard against her own forehead.
Meanwhile, outside Hurst’s shabby rental, an old pickup fishtailed to a stop in a haze of swirling dust. The door swung open from within.
Hurst dragged a tied and struggling man from the back seat.
Afara almost collapsed, his legs wobbling.
“Get moving! What, did you forget how to walk? You’re slower than a snail,” Hurst shouted, impatience crackling in his voice.
Trying to regain his balance, Afara glanced around, looking utterly lost. How had things come to this—him, the Wolfpack’s third-in-command, being tossed around like baggage by Hurst, all because he had Noah backing him up? When had he ever suffered such humiliation?
Growing frustrated with Afara’s sluggishness, Hurst raised a threatening fist, his intent clear.
He wasn’t holding back. One wrong move, and Afara would pay for it.
“All right, all right!” Afara scrambled backwards, hands raised in surrender. “No need for violence! I’ll pick up the pace, see? You two are completely nuts.”
He still couldn’t believe what these two had done—setting fire to the lighthouse, kidnapping him in broad daylight.
The nerve!
  ? .
His eyes darted nervously, and suddenly, he tried a different approach, his voice oozing with forced friendliness.noveldrama
“Hey, uh, about my illness… Think there’s still hope for a cure?”
Hurst shot him a frosty look and shrugged. “Depends on whether I feel like helping you or not.”
Noah stepped out from behind the wheel, his movements deliberate, and trailed behind them.
He took in the isolated surroundings, his gaze turning somber and watchful.
Right now, he knew Sadie was with White Tiger and the Wolfpack’s boss.
With Afara, the third-ranking member, now in their custody, the gang leader wouldn’t risk making any reckless moves.
At least for the moment, Sadie’s safety seemed assured.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1333:
Noah drew a steady breath and moved deeper inside.
The apartment itself was sparsely furnished, bordering on run-down. Hurst didn’t bother with pleasantries—he kicked the door wide open and practically tossed Afara into a corner.
Even being tied down, Afara acted as if he owned the place, flashing Hurst a cocky grin and whistling mockingly.
That attitude alone was enough to make anyone want to rough him up a little more.
Out of nowhere, a faint electronic “beep” broke the silence, coming from somewhere on Afara’s body.
The sound was barely audible, but in that still room, it cut through like a siren.
Hurst’s expression sharpened immediately.
He and Noah had checked Afara head to toe before the drive. There shouldn’t have been a single device left.
Noah lounged on a battered sofa, his dark eyes fixed on Afara before flicking meaningfully over to Hurst.
That single glance said everything.
Without hesitation, Hurst started cracking his knuckles, a smirk on his lips. “All right, let’s see what you’re hiding.”
Spotting Hurst closing in with clear intent, Afara put on a dramatic performance. “What’s this? Assault in broad daylight? Somebody help!
I’m being attacked here!”
His theatrics only made Hurst’s scowl deepen.
Without hesitation, Hurst seized Afara by the collar, shaking him a little harder. “Hand it over. Now.”
Afara just blinked, feigning innocence. “No clue what you’re talking about. Didn’t you already empty my pockets?”
Hurst just let out a low laugh. “Maybe I missed something.”
In the next instant, he was rummaging around Afara’s waistband. Sure enough, he uncovered a small, hard .

A micro-communicator, no bigger than a matchbox, had been stitched cleverly into the belt lining.
A smirk of triumph tugged at Hurst’s lips as he handed the device over to Noah.noveldrama
Noah took the communicator, flipping it open and running his fingers over the controls.
The tiny screen flickered to life, displaying a message.
“Mr. Stewart’s daughter has hurt herself. She’s being rushed to City Hospital.”
It had been sent to a private group chat.
Noah’s expression darkened immediately, his entire presence tightening with tension.
Mr. Stewart’s daughter?
Noah’s eyes narrowed as he looked up. “Does anyone in your ranks have a daughter?”
.

###Chapter 1334:
Afara squirmed under Noah’s stare, shaking his head with exaggerated earnestness. “I swear I have no clue. I’m just here for the perks, not the secrets. Nobody tells me anything important. I’m basically useless.”
Afara was really frustrated now.
So much for being third in command. It meant nothing right now.
Noah watched him closely, searching for any sign of a lie.
Afara’s cluelessness seemed real, but Noah knew he couldn’t afford to overlook even the smallest chance.
If there was even a remote connection to Sadie, he had to check it out. Turning to Hurst, Noah spoke in a low, urgent voice.
“Watch him. I’m heading to the City Hospital.”noveldrama
Hurst gave a curt nod, his face serious.
“Be careful. Don’t let your guard down.”
The air within City Hospital hung heavy with the piercing scent of disinfectant.
Sadie’s consciousness gradually surfaced from a murky haze. A piercing pain pulsed through her forehead as she fought to open her eyes, discovering a stark white ceiling stretched above her.
She moved with careful precision, recognizing that she lay sprawled across a hospital bed with an IV needle embedded in her wrist. Her desperate gamble hadn’t been wasted. Emerson would never allow her to die, exactly as she had predicted.
Yet, she had simultaneously lost the gamble as well.
At the entrance stood a burly man with a harsh face, his body pressed against the wall. He was one of Emerson’s most trusted associates, known throughout the organization as Leopard.
Like an unyielding sentinel protecting the chamber, he severed all connection between the room and the outside world. The so-called medical treatment was nothing more than a change of venue for maintaining strict surveillance over Sadie.
Sadie carefully propped herself upright, the bandage wrapped around her forehead seeping with fresh spots of blood, which intensified her already ghostly pale complexion.
She methodically surveyed her surroundings, her gaze coldly evaluating this new prison, desperately searching for any potential escape route.
The door swung open, and a nurse wearing a surgical mask stepped inside, carrying a metal tray.
She efficiently inspected the IV bag and spoke in a formulaic tone, “How are you feeling?”
Sadie refused to respond, simply observing her with unwavering attention.
The nurse’s eyes remained unnaturally calm, devoid of any trace of genuine emotion, not even a flicker of sympathy or surprise at the sight of her brutal wound.
Sadie immediately recognized that she belonged to Emerson’s network. The nurse, completely unaffected by Sadie’s deliberate silence, continued scribbling notes on her clipboard.
“If you need anything, just press the bell.” She gestured toward the call button positioned beside the bed, then pivoted to leave.

###Chapter 1335:
Sadie’s voice, cold and crystalline, halted her departure. “Where’s my phone?”
The nurse froze mid-step, glancing back with a barely perceptible flash of wariness flickering in her eyes.
“Patients require complete rest; electronic devices aren’t medically advisable.” With that dismissive statement, the nurse departed, sealing the door behind her.
Sadie’s gaze transformed into pure ice.
She extended her free hand and pressed the red emergency call button without a moment’s hesitation.
The shrill alarm failed to echo through the hallway.
Instead, the door burst open within seconds.
Leopard stormed inside, his eyes dark and threatening as he fixed his gaze on Sadie. He moved decisively to the wall and severed the power supply to the call button.
The signal had been intercepted from the very beginning.
Sadie’s heart plummeted deeper into despair.
In the darkness of night, a black SUV raced along the highway that led into the city.
Noah sat rigid in the backseat, surrounded by an unrelenting chill that seemed to penetrate his very bones.noveldrama
Mr. Stewart’s daughter…
Hurt herself…
The City Hospital…
Those words materialized in Noah’s mind over and over again, haunting him like malevolent spells.
Since when had a girl emerged within the Wolfpack’s ranks?
Noah had conducted extensive investigations, learning only about Emerson and two other key leaders, never once hearing anything of Emerson’s daughter.
Had the intelligence been flawed, or did this represent a meticulously orchestrated trap?
Yet, Afara’s reaction had appeared completely genuine, as though he truly possessed no knowledge of the situation.
So, who exactly could Emerson’s daughter be?
Regardless of the truth, the timing felt far too coincidental, intensifying Noah’s escalating sense of foreboding.
Noah refused to contemplate the most devastating possibility, yet Sadie’s image involuntarily materialized in his troubled mind.
She had been captured and taken by Emerson.
And now, Emerson’s mysterious daughter had suddenly been rushed to the City Hospital.
Noah adamantly refused to believe that it could be Sadie.
Sadie possessed incredible strength and resilience; she would never resort to such a desperate act.
.

###Chapter 1336:
But what if… what if Emerson had driven her to such desperation? Noah’s knuckles turned pale, his eyes darkening and becoming impenetrable, resembling the depths of a frozen lake.
Upon arriving at the City Hospital, Noah commanded his men to remain stationed outside while he quickly donned a white lab coat and a surgical mask, slipping inside completely undetected.
The hospital corridors stretched eerily quiet through the night, his measured footsteps creating haunting echoes.
Following the crucial intelligence gathered by his men, he swiftly navigated his way toward the exclusive VIP ward.
As he approached the end of the third-floor hallway, several men instantly turned their attention toward him, their bodies tensing with alert suspicion.
Though they wore casual civilian clothing, their rigid posture and calculating gazes betrayed their professionally trained identities.
They belonged to Emerson’s carefully selected team.
One of them approached with deliberate casualness, feigning nonchalance while extending a medical record toward Noah.
“Doctor, the patient in Room 302 isn’t doing well at all. You should examine her immediately.”
Noah’s penetrating gaze dropped to the file.
The patient’s name appeared completely unfamiliar, but the room number matched exactly with the information his men had discovered. He internally…
He scoffed but maintained a perfectly composed facade, nodding professionally as he accepted the file and walked directly toward Room 302.
He understood with absolute certainty that this was a meticulously constructed trap.
Noah possessed no alternative—he had to enter that room.noveldrama
He required visual confirmation of the room’s occupant with his own eyes.
As he thrust the door open, lethal danger crashed into his consciousness like a sledgehammer to his solar plexus.
g?lnσνs?c?m is a world of wonder
The room appeared vacant, but from concealed positions behind curtains and shadowed corners, multiple gun barrels had already locked onto Noah’s position.
In that split second, the room exploded with murderous gunfire.
Noah responded with lightning reflexes, diving into a roll to evade the lethal barrage. His movements flowed with deadly grace while he returned fire with surgical precision at each muzzle flash.
The thunderous gunfire and exploding glass created a deafening orchestra of destruction within the cramped hospital room.
Through the mayhem, a bullet carved across his arm, painting a crimson streak along his flesh.
Noah released a guttural growl as searing agony lanced through his wounded arm.
Without pause, he kicked open the door to the adjacent emergency room and plunged through the opening.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1337:
However, when he witnessed the figure sprawled across the emergency bed, his pupils constricted with shock.
The patient was decidedly not the alleged “Mr. Stewart’s daughter.” Instead, a massive brute with a blood-crusted bandage wrapped around his wrist reclined there, sneering at Noah with malicious satisfaction. The thug was merely one of Emerson’s expendable foot soldiers.
The entire scenario had been an elaborate snare, meticulously crafted to ensnare Noah.
Meanwhile, within his cramped apartment, Hurst scrutinized the miniature communication device clutched in his palm, his brow creased with intense concentration.
Sudden comprehension struck him—the device found within Afara’s belt served dual purposes, both receiving transmissions and broadcasting their location.
As he examined the device more closely, the screen illuminated once more, revealing a fresh communication.
“Noah has fallen into the trap. Quickly move Afara to the warehouse at west port.”
Dread plummeted through Hurst’s chest like a stone through water. The instant his vigilance faltered, the entire situation transformed catastrophically.
Afara, who had been masterfully feigning unconsciousness in the corner, suddenly erupted into deadly action.
His eyes blazed with predatory intent as his tongue pushed out a razor-thin blade, delicate as a cicada’s wing, from the inner side of his gums. The micro-blade sliced through his restraints with surgical precision, liberating his limbs in absolute silence.noveldrama
“Oh, no!” Hurst realized the danger he was in far too late.
Afara launched himself forward with the explosive velocity and savage intensity of a hunting panther, abandoning all pretense of being a harmless playboy.
Hurst spun to defend against the assault, and both men immediately became entangled in vicious hand-to-hand combat.
Despite his inferior fighting abilities, placing him at a tactical disadvantage, Afara demonstrated intimate knowledge of the room’s every detail.
He executed a masterful feint before pivoting sideways, causing Hurst’s powerful strike to miss completely and sending him stumbling off-balance.
Capitalizing on that critical moment, Afara drove his foot into the table, sending the kerosene lamp crashing to the floor.
Oil splashed across the floor and burst into flames without warning. “Boom!” Fire exploded through the air, devouring the ramshackle wooden structure within heartbeats.
While the flames drove Hurst backward, Afara bolted through the door without sparing a single glance behind him.
Once outside, he hacked and wheezed, turning to watch the building surrender to the inferno as a frigid smile crept across his face. Instead of reaching out to Emerson, he withdrew another device from his jacket and punched in an encrypted number.
Someone picked up on the second ring.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1338:
Every trace of emotion drained from Afara’s features, leaving behind nothing but icy calculation.
“The plan worked perfectly. Noah took a bullet, and Sadie is in the hospital.” His voice dropped to barely above a whisper, though victory rang clear in every word. “I have the item. Per our arrangement, we can move forward with the trade.”
Dense smoke poured through the air, making it almost impossible to breathe.
Hurst stumbled from the blazing wreckage, ash coating his skin like war paint, before his legs gave out and he crashed to the earth in a fit of violent coughing.
His chest burned as though he had swallowed liquid fire.
He pushed himself upright, staring at the skeletal remains of the wooden shack while rage and terror battled for control of his thoughts. He spat curses at Afara’s name.
Afara had never been just some carefree playboy—he was a calculating predator who had waited patiently for the perfect moment to strike. The bastard had mapped every corner of the building better than him, the one who lived there.
Each gesture, each piece of bait, had been precisely orchestrated.
The truth hit Hurst like a sledgehammer—Noah was walking into danger, and the message had been nothing more than carefully crafted bait.
Panic seized Hurst as he patted down his pockets, relief flooding through him when his fingers found his phone and the screen flickered to life.
His hands shook as he entered the digits burned into his memory.
The phone rang endlessly before someone finally picked up, but instead of Noah’s voice, he heard the sharp crack of gunshots and the dull thud of bodies hitting the floor.
Hurst’s heart slammed against his ribs and lodged in his throat. “Noah! It’s a setup! You need to get out now! Afara got away—he torched my place. The son of a bitch isn’t with the Wolfpack!”
Noah’s voice came through steady and controlled, though Hurst caught the telltale rasp of labored breathing. “I know.”
Hurst fell silent, understanding dawning on him that Noah had probably smelled the trap long before he’d walked into it.
“The story about Emerson’s daughter hurting herself—it was a lie. Afara fed us that bullshit to draw you out. He…”
  ? .
Before he could complete the thought, a strangled groan echoed through the speaker, the sound of someone fighting through excruciating pain.
Hurst’s chest tightened like a vise.
“Are you hurt?”
Several seconds of silence stretched between them before Noah’s voice cut through again, sharp with authority despite the circumstances. “Find somewhere safe and stay put. I’ll reach out when this mess is cleaned up.”
The call was abruptly disconnected.noveldrama
Frozen in place, Hurst gripped the phone, a chill creeping up his spine. When this mess was cleaned up?
Noah was wounded, cornered by enemies. How was he supposed to clean up the mess?
.
.
.
###Chapter 1339:
Afara had blindsided them, knocking their plans off balance with a single move.
Hurst knew there were more tricks coming from Afara, and the one he was truly loyal to was certainly not Emerson.
A sharp tang of antiseptic filled the air, clinging to every surface. Above Sadie, blank whiteness stretched across the ceiling, so still she could count each heavy thump of her own heart.
Blinking against the light, she gradually woke, pain flaring at her forehead.
With a careful shift, she found herself nestled in unfamiliar bedding, an IV taped securely to her hand.
No telltale sounds of nurses or hospital bustle drifted in; something about the silence pressed down on her chest.
This place didn’t feel like any hospital. The hush was too complete, the atmosphere thick with unease.
Deep down, she understood that Emerson still held all the cards.
Her desperate bid for freedom had failed.
Now, instead of escaping, she was still in his grasp, battered and defeated.
Where was Noah?
How was he?
Was it possible he had already walked straight into that so-called trap? That possibility twisted like a knife inside her, stealing the air from her lungs.
A faint creak interrupted her thoughts as the door swung open.
Into the quiet stepped Emerson.
No entourage followed. He dragged a chair closer and took a seat by her bedside.
His eyes lingered on the bandage across her forehead, but any hint of gentleness was gone, and only a cold, detached gaze remained. Something about Sadie reminded him of Brenda—unyielding and impossible to break.
Still, that fierce spirit was exactly what left her exposed, and one wrong move could break her.
Noah was the chink in her armor, the secret that made her weak.
g α? ησ ν ?s?com takes you away
A level, unemotional voice drifted over. “You’re awake.”
Without lifting her head, Sadie turned away, hiding her face in the pillow and shutting him out.
A sigh slipped from Emerson, empty of sympathy. “Why do this to yourself, Sadie? Hurting yourself accomplishes nothing here. Do you really think this will buy your freedom? Or is it supposed to rattle me?”
In silence, Sadie clenched the sheet so tightly her knuckles blanched. Emerson watched her.
“Everything you did made it obvious how much that young man, Noah, means to you.”
Just the sound of Noah’s name sent a violent shudder through Sadie. Finally, she met his gaze, her eyes rimmed with red, burning with accusation.
Rough and raw, her voice broke the quiet. “What did you do to him?”noveldrama
.
.
.
###Chapter 1340:
A thin, mocking smile flickered at Emerson’s lips. “It wasn’t me. Seems your precious Noah has collected plenty of enemies on his own.” He leaned back, crossing his legs, speaking as if the whole mess hardly concerned him.
“Afara, who’s supposed to be my right hand,” he continued, “decided to betray me. He led Noah right into a trap at City Hospital.”
The news hit Sadie hard; her eyes narrowed in alarm.
Amusement sharpened Emerson’s smile, making it colder still.
“Odds are, he’s in Afara’s hands as we speak. Hurt, too.”
Each sentence struck like a blow, and Sadie felt her hope draining away.
Ice ran through her veins, draining all color from her face.
Emerson leaned in, his voice razor-sharp. “Are you starting to see? Only you can save him now. Enough of the theatrics. Give me what your mother left behind, and I’ll make sure Noah returns to you in one piece.”
Though his words were soft, the threat beneath them was clear as day. Here was the real Emerson—calculating, unyielding, and ready to play every angle.
Whatever warmth he had once shown was nothing more than a mask for this very moment.
A hollow laugh caught in Sadie’s throat as she stared at him.
How could a woman as wise as her mother have fallen in love with a man like this?
No promise from him was worth believing.
Turning her face away, Sadie closed her eyes and shut him out completely.
With his patience waning, Emerson fixed his gaze on her, growing colder with every second of silence.
That was the final warning.
Rising from his chair, he cast a cold glance at Sadie lying on the bed.
“Make your choice,” he said coldly. “My tolerance won’t last forever. I’ve already sent men after Afara, but Noah’s fate rests entirely on what you decide next.”
At the doorstep, he stopped, just for a moment. “Take care of yourself, my daughter.”
Stay tuned for updates at g?lnσνs?c?m
A heavy thud followed as the door swung shut, and the sharp click of the lock echoed through the silence.
When Sadie was finally alone, her eyes flew open, staring into the emptiness that surrounded her.
Sadie lay curled on the bed, her eyes fixed on the ceiling above. Every word Emerson had spoken sliced through her like a shard of ice, each one driving deeper into her heart.
Noah was injured. Worse still, he had fallen into the clutches of that traitor, Mara.
While she remained trapped here, Sadie had become nothing more than Emerson’s most lethal weapon, its edge turned toward the one person she cherished above all else.
Hurting herself had been the most foolish choice.
Only now did the truth of Emerson’s words fully sink in.
.

###Chapter 1341:noveldrama
Her reckless defiance hadn’t won her freedom. Instead, it had stripped away every defense, exposing her vulnerabilities before this man who dared to call himself her father.
This had to end.
Noah’s life hung in the balance, as did Hurst’s.
Then there was Afara, that enigma she couldn’t even begin to understand.
She had to escape this place.
Freedom was the only path forward, the only way to reclaim control and plan her next move.
Drawing in a steadying breath, she pushed herself upright. Pain flared from the gash on her forehead, but the ache brought something unexpected: a crystal-clear focus that cut through the fog of her despair.
She moved to the door, raised her fist, and knocked with purpose. “I need to speak with Emerson.”
Silence greeted her from the other side, though she knew the guard had heard every word.
Minutes crawled by before the lock clicked open.
Emerson stepped inside.
He came without any subordinates, dragging a chair close to her bedside before settling into it.
His gaze drifted to the bandage circling her forehead, stripped of any warmth it might have once carried. “Have you reached a decision?”
Sadie lifted her eyes to meet his, and this time she held steady. Her eyes remained red-rimmed, but where ice had once lived, now only profound, unshakeable calm remained.
“I agree to your terms,” she said, her voice rough yet perfectly clear.
Emerson’s brows rose slightly. He was caught off guard by her swift surrender.
It seemed the young man, Noah, carried more weight in her heart than he had calculated.

“But I have my own conditions,” Sadie pressed on. “I want my freedom.” She fixed Emerson with unblinking resolve.
“Keep me caged here, and I’m useless to you. I won’t give you anything you want.”
She hesitated, drawing a deep breath. “I’ll hand over everything my mother left behind, but not yet.”
Emerson’s expression darkened, storm-clouds gathering over his face, tension crackling around him like electricity.
Sadie remained untouched by his shift in mood, pressing forward. “I need to see Noah safe with my own eyes. Only when he’s out of danger will I give you what you’re after. That condition isn’t up for debate.”
Sadie was striking a bargain with Emerson, wielding his deepest desires as leverage to protect the one who held her heart.
Emerson studied her face, then suddenly broke into laughter.

###Chapter 1342:
The sound rolled low and haunting through the stillness of the room. What a remarkable daughter he had! Even in negotiation, she radiated that unbreakable fire.
He found himself admiring it.
“Alright,” he conceded with startling ease. “You have my word, dear.”
Rising from his chair, he gazed down at her, his voice sliding back into that unsettling, tender warmth. “Your freedom is yours from this moment forward. I’ll dispatch some people to track down Noah’s location immediately and bring you word the instant we learn anything.”
When he reached the door, his fingers closed around the handle, and he cast one final look over his shoulder.
“Sadie, don’t attempt anything reckless again. Such actions would truly wound me.”
The door whispered shut behind him.
The warmth melted from Emerson’s features in an instant, replaced by shadows too deep to fathom.
Turning to Leopard, who remained vigilant outside, he issued his orders in cold, arctic tones. “Have someone follow Sadie. Watch her every move, but remain unseen. Any suspicious activity should be reported to me immediately.”
Leopard dipped his head in acknowledgment. “Understood.”
Emerson walked away, his departing silhouette rigid as forged iron.
Freedom?noveldrama
Within these manor walls, as long as he willed it otherwise, true freedom would forever elude Sadie’s grasp.
He had granted her the illusion of liberty, much like releasing a kite while keeping the string tightly wound around his fist.
What he craved was nothing less than total dominion.
Shortly after Emerson’s departure, the guards stationed outside Sadie’s door melted away.
The door to her room was no longer locked.
.cóm is the source
Sadie pushed the door wide and stepped into the hallway.
The hallway stretched empty before her. Gone were the guards who had once marked every few paces like silent monuments. That crushing sense of imprisonment seemed to have lifted.
Yet Sadie understood the truth beneath the performance.
Hidden in every shadow, countless eyes would be tracking her movements.
She didn’t venture far, taking only a moment to survey her newfound circumstances before retreating to her room.
Roughly an hour passed before a bodyguard appeared, phone in hand. Her phone.
“Mr. Stewart asked me to return this to you.” The bodyguard extended the device with practiced courtesy.
Sadie accepted the phone, her fingertips like ice against its surface. She pressed the power button.

###Chapter 1343:
The screen lit up, but instead of her familiar wallpaper, only factory defaults greeted her. Everything had been reset to its original state. Every piece of data within the device had been wiped away. Photos, messages, contacts—all erased.
Every conversation thread with Noah, his gentle reminders, the tender fragments of their shared days had vanished.noveldrama
Not even a ghost remained.
Emerson Stewart!
That bastard!
Rage erupted from deep within her chest, a molten wave that threatened to drown every rational thought.
Sadie’s grip tightened around the phone until her knuckles went pale, veins standing out like cords along the back of her hand. Through this single gesture, Emerson was driving home his message once more: everything in her world existed at his mercy.
The bodyguard caught sight of her bloodless complexion and instinctively retreated a step.
Forcing air into her lungs, Sadie released it in a slow, controlled stream, wrestling down the explosion building inside her chest. Anger was a luxury she couldn’t afford right now.
Revealing her true feelings would be beyond foolish.
She raised her eyes to meet the bodyguard’s gaze, her expression smoothing into perfect composure. Her voice emerged steady and untroubled. “Thank you. You may leave.”
The bodyguard fled as though he’d been granted a pardon.
Silence reclaimed the room, leaving Sadie truly alone once more.
She lowered herself to the edge of the bed, staring down at the hollow device in her hands. Ice crystallized in her veins with each passing second.
Where was Noah at this very moment?
gα?ησν?s?com hosts captivating tales
How severe were his injuries?
What twisted plans did that creature Afara have in store?
Every line of communication had been severed. She was flying blind, cut off from the world spinning beyond these walls.
The sensation was crushing, stealing the very breath from her lungs.
No.
She refused to remain here, paralyzed and powerless.
Waiting would mean surrendering Noah’s fate entirely to Emerson’s whims.
Trust was impossible where Emerson was concerned.
This was a man who could toy with his own flesh and blood, wipe her phone clean, and obliterate every trace of her treasured past without a flicker of conscience. His promises were worth less than dust.
As Sadie rose abruptly from the bed, her attention caught on her ghostly reflection staring back from the mirror.
The stark white bandage across her forehead served as a brutal reminder never to repeat such reckless mistakes.
She yanked the door open and strode out with purpose.
A bodyguard materialized from his post, sliding smoothly into her path. Though his manner remained courteous, steel underlay his words. “Ma’am, Mr. Stewart’s orders were clear. You need rest until you’ve fully healed.”
Sadie didn’t bother lifting her gaze. She merely flicked him a glance that could freeze fire.
That arctic stare made even the mountain of a man shift uncomfortably.
Her arrival had been rushed, leaving her trapped in blood-stained garments, looking like a disaster barely held together.
She couldn’t face anyone in this condition, couldn’t allow herself to appear as some broken thing begging for pity.
“I came here with nothing but the clothes on me. Take me to the nearest shopping center. I need some new attire.”
Conflict immediately painted the bodyguard’s features. “But… Mr. Stewart gave no such authorization.”
Emerson had commanded surveillance, not escort duty.
Should something go wrong, the consequences would fall squarely on his shoulders.
Sadie finally met his eyes directly, a razor-sharp smile curving her lips. “What exactly are you suggesting? That Emerson’s own daughter lacks the simple freedom to purchase clothing?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1344:
Sadie stepped forward, her presence radiating intimidation like a tangible force.
“Or do you think, as a mere bodyguard, you can make decisions on behalf of my father?” Her voice carried a venomous edge, each word carefully measured. “Should I call him right now and talk about how you’re ‘taking care’ of me?”
Without hesitation, she wielded her status as Emerson’s daughter like a weapon, his name alone carrying devastating power.
Cold sweat beaded on the bodyguard’s forehead as panic crept into his features.
Everyone working at the estate knew Sadie’s true identity as the long-lost daughter of the manor’s master.
Each servant had witnessed firsthand the devotion Emerson showed her.
Crossing her over something so petty could spell disaster if she whispered even a single complaint into Emerson’s ear.
Wrestling with the impossible choice, the bodyguard finally surrendered, bowing his head in defeat. “The car will be ready immediately, ma’am.”
Sadie’s lips curved in a cold smile as she looked away with satisfaction. This victory was merely the beginning of her grand plan.
Using the precious identity Emerson had bestowed upon her, she would claim every ounce of freedom within her grasp.
Meanwhile, Hurst carefully followed the cryptic markers Noah had left behind—signals only the two of them could decipher—until he finally reached a presidential suite in a five-star hotel.
Smoothing down his smoke-stained clothes, he pressed the doorbell.
The door swung open almost instantly.
Relief flooded through Hurst’s chest at the sight of Noah standing before him.
Yet as Hurst stepped inside and absorbed the opulent surroundings, shock froze him in place.
With Emerson’s and Afara’s forces searching every corner of the city, could they really hole up in such a brazen location?
Then, realization struck him like lightning.
M ?ρ  ν.
They were hiding in plain sight.
Sometimes the most dangerous place became the ultimate sanctuary.
While search teams combed through derelict warehouses and remote hideouts, their quarry lounged comfortably in the city’s most visible luxury hotel.
The strategy was nothing short of genius.noveldrama
“You’re injured.” Hurst’s gaze fixed on Noah’s bandaged arm, concern deepening the lines around his eyes.
Moving with efficiency, he grabbed clean gauze and antiseptic from the room’s medical supplies, his hands steady despite the urgency. The bullet had torn through flesh in a vicious graze; while not life-threatening, the raw wound looked agonizing.
Noah endured the treatment in stoic silence, his dark eyes remaining as cold and unreadable as winter stone.
Their plan had been flawless, accounting for every variable except one wildcard: Afara.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1345:
Afara was a master manipulator, calculating and merciless in ways that made him a formidable enemy.
“That cunning bastard, Afara!” Fury blazed in Hurst’s voice as he spat the words through clenched teeth. “He outmaneuvered us, even managing to fool Emerson himself.”
Their defeat this time had been absolute and humiliating.
Beyond failing to rescue Sadie, Noah bore wounds from the efforts, and Afara had even managed to flee with the most crucial item.
Noah’s lips twisted into a bitter sneer, frost gathering in his stare. “Members of the Wolfpack are never to be taken lightly.”
Silence settled between them like a heavy shroud.
The truth was undeniable. Anyone who survived in that brutal world long enough to reach the top possessed skills that made them extremely dangerous adversaries.noveldrama
This round had ended with them trailing behind, Sadie still trapped, and Noah bleeding from their failed attempt.
The weight of Sadie’s continued captivity pressed down on Hurst’s chest like a stone.
Yet Noah’s inner turmoil ran far deeper than what showed on his composed surface.
While Afara certainly posed a significant threat, the real nightmare that haunted Noah’s sleepless nights was Emerson himself.
Sadie, trapped under Emerson’s roof, would face a warped version of fatherly love that was nothing more than a suffocating cage of manipulation.
The image of her enduring that monster’s twisted affection alone sent waves of agony through his chest, making each breath feel like swallowing broken glass.
Compared to that torment, the throbbing wound on his arm felt like nothing.
Studying Noah’s rigid profile, Hurst spoke in a gentle tone. “We lost several good people today. Moving forward, we’ll need to be even more careful.”
Noah remained motionless, offering only the slightest nod as his gaze stayed locked on the glittering cityscape beyond the window, his eyes as cold and impenetrable as black ice.
Somewhere in that maze of lights, he would find his answer. Whatever it took, he would bring Sadie home safe and sound, untouched by the darkness that surrounded her.
Your escape begins at g?lnσνs?com
Hurst’s brow creased as he struggled to piece together a fragmented memory.
All at once, he struck his thigh with sudden realization.
“Wait, I just remembered something.”
Uncertainty flickered across his features, though urgency burned bright in his expression. “Back at my apartment, before all that chaos, I got this weird message. It mentioned the warehouse at West Port.
Think it could be important? Should I check it out?”
Noah weighed the possibilities in careful silence.
This could easily be bait, a carefully laid snare from either Afara or Emerson.
.

###Chapter 1346:
Yet given their desperate circumstances, every thread had to be pulled, no matter how thin.
Even walking straight into a trap was better than standing still while Sadie remained in danger.
When all else failed, sometimes the only choice was to risk everything.
Noah shifted to face Hurst’s expectant stare.
“Go ahead.” Though spoken quietly, his words carried the weight of absolute command. “Stay sharp out there.”noveldrama
Hurst gave a resolute nod, then slipped out without another word.
Silence reclaimed the luxurious room.
Noah stood sentinel by the window, his imposing frame cutting a solitary figure against the backdrop of city lights. Minutes later, soft knocking interrupted the quiet.
A suited bodyguard stepped inside, his face grave with important news. “Mr. Wall, our surveillance team tracked a Wolfpack vehicle from the vicinity of City Hospital all the way to Bellflower Mall.”
The bodyguard paused, choosing his words with care. “A whole group got out of the car. All of them looked like security.” A sharp glint flashed in Noah’s eyes.
The Wolfpack.
Bellflower Mall.
Why would they show up so openly in one of the busiest spots in town?
What were they after?
A ridiculous, almost hopeful theory popped into his head.
Maybe Emerson’s version of “freedom” was taking Sadie on a shopping spree?
The thought was almost laughable, but for a split second, it thawed something inside him.
Your next chapter is here gα?ησνs?com
He had to see for himself if there was any truth to it.
Without another word, he spun on his heel, grabbed his coat from the back of the sofa, and shrugged it on with quick, practiced movements. His arm flinched at the sudden motions, but he ignored the pain.
“We’re going there. Now.” His voice was glacial, brimming with barely contained intensity. “Let’s find out what the Wolfpack is really up to.”
Meanwhile, inside Bellflower Mall, Sadie wandered through a boutique that catered to the city’s elite.
She let her fingertips trail across the sleek fabrics, her face set in a mask of boredom, playing the part of a wealthy heiress simply killing time.
Piece after piece, she plucked designer dresses from the racks, but her attention was never on the clothes. Her sharp eyes never stopped scanning the surroundings, watching, waiting.
She was desperate for some kind of opening.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1347:
The boutique was wired with three cameras, one fixed on the entrance, the others angled to watch the aisles.
Two men stationed by the door acted absorbed in their phones, though their watchful glances kept returning to her.
A woman nearby, supposedly shopping for accessories, had been pretending to admire the same scarf for ages.
Emerson’s surveillance left no weak spot. The trap around Sadie was as elegant as it was suffocating.
She felt like a songbird trapped in a lavish cage, allowed to flutter, but never really free.
Choosing a soft cream dress from the rack, Sadie slipped into the fitting room.
With the door closed behind her, the world outside disappeared. She studied her reflection, skin pale and colorless, but her eyes burned with fierce intensity.
The sting from the cut on her forehead was still there, a warning not to act without thinking.
She had to be clever. She needed a window, however small, to slip out a message, all while under constant surveillance.
She swapped outfits and stepped out, bracing herself.
A sales assistant immediately approached her with a beaming smile. “Ma’am, this dress looks absolutely perfect on you, like it was made for you.”
Sadie’s answer was a cold glance and silence as she moved past, making a beeline for the register.
Pretty clothes meant nothing to her now.
This outing wasn’t about shopping. It was about seizing whatever slim chance she could create.
After paying, Sadie strode from the shop, bag in hand.
Her guards moved at once, their presence clinging to her like a second shadow.
Sadie walked on, eyes fixed ahead, her pace calm, making it seem like everything before had been nothing but her imagination.
g?ν.k? –    noveldrama
Still, that fleeting moment of eye contact lingered, seared into her memory like a brand. There was no mistaking it.
Noah was here.
He’d actually shown up.
She kept moving, looking like she was aimlessly drifting through the mall, all the while mapping her next steps with quick, sidelong glances. A restroom sign appeared up ahead, a crowded, bustling spot that just might provide the cover she needed.
As she weighed her options and prepared to speak, her gaze swept over the edge of a column almost by accident.
She froze mid-step.
That corner was cloaked in shadows, perfect for hiding.

###Chapter 1348:
And there, half-lost in the dim light, was a silhouette she would recognize anywhere.
There he stood, waiting in that darkness.
Noah.
Their eyes locked across the distance.noveldrama
For one heartbeat, everything else fell away, time stood still, the mall’s noise faded, and all that remained was the concern in his gaze and the storm of emotion raging inside her.
Her pulse thundered so loudly it felt like it might break free from her chest.
Yet she forced herself to stay cool, burying every tremor of fear and longing beneath a practiced mask.
Beside Noah stood another familiar figure. It was Hurst.
Hurst gave the slightest shake of his head, just enough for her to catch the urgent warning in his eyes.
They had to play it smart.
One wrong move and both men would be trapped right here with her. Sadie got the message immediately.
She dropped her gaze, erasing any sign that moment had ever existed between them.
The restroom was no longer an option.
There were too many people lingering nearby, and if Emerson’s men ended up butting heads with Noah’s crew, it would turn into chaos. She needed a quieter spot, somewhere less likely to draw attention.
Her eyes landed on a luxurious boutique just a few steps away. Without missing a beat, she turned around and addressed her silent escorts, her tone all business.
“I’m going in to try on some clothes.” She paused at the doorway, icy gaze raking over the guards. “You lot can wait outside.”
One bodyguard hesitated, uncertainty flickering on his face.
Sadie didn’t give him a chance to argue. She marched ahead, her voice cool and clipped with authority. “What’s the matter? Scared I’ll make a run for it?”
A smirk curled at her lips. “Or maybe you want to follow me in and watch me undress? Tell you what, if anyone even thinks about it, I’ll have my dad make sure they regret it for the rest of their life.”

Sadie’s threat, cold and spiteful, dripped with the reckless audacity of a spoiled rich girl tied to the underworld.
The bodyguards traded wary glances, the unease in their eyes perfectly echoed in each other’s.
More than anyone, they understood the extent of Emerson’s cruelty.
No one in their right mind would dismiss Sadie’s threat as empty. None of them were willing to wager their future—or their lives—on testing her resolve.
At last, the lead bodyguard dipped his head. “Go ahead, ma’am. We’ll stand by the entrance.”
A faint smile tugged at Sadie’s lips as she turned and strode into the luxury boutique, never once glancing back.

###Chapter 1349:
The heavy glass doors shut behind her, closing off the outside world and granting a fleeting moment of relief. Cold sweat had already soaked through her back.
Each step, each carefully chosen word, had felt like walking a tightrope, utterly exhausting.
Yet despite it all, she had pulled it off.
Sadie had carved out something invaluable—time and space—for both herself and Noah.
Inside, a sales assistant welcomed her with a bright, professional smile. Sadie willed herself to relax, masking every flicker of emotion behind a practiced, icy exterior.
She gestured casually at a few garments, her voice steady and unaffected. “Take these to the fitting room.”
She shot another glance at the assistant, her tone breezy. “Also, could you grab me a pen and a piece of paper? A design idea just popped into my head. I need to jot it down.”
The request seemed perfectly ordinary.
After all, everyone in the design circle knew Sadie as a designer with sudden bursts of inspiration.
Unconcerned, the assistant gathered the items without question, then gestured politely to the fitting room. “Ma’am, this way, please.” Sadie slipped inside.
The door clicked softly behind her, sealing her in with the sharp rhythm of her breath in the confined space.
She sagged against the door, her legs trembling, barely holding her upright.
But Sadie knew she couldn’t afford even a second of weakness now.
She drew in a deep breath and pushed herself toward the mirror. The woman staring back from the mirror looked ghostly pale, yet her eyes blazed with fierce determination.
Time had become her enemy now.
She snatched the pen and scribbled a message on the paper, her trembling fingers creating crooked letters that somehow remained perfectly readable.
The moment she finished writing, she folded the paper into a small square and swept her gaze across the room, searching for the perfect hiding place.
Find the magic on g?lnσν?s?
Her eyes landed on the fitting room’s corner, where the carpet’s edge had curled up slightly.
She dropped to her knees, peeled back the carpet’s edge with steady hands, and slipped the note beneath before smoothing everything back into place until no evidence remained.
With that done, she finally exhaled in relief.noveldrama
She slipped into the dress she had just bought in another store, wiped all emotion from her face like erasing a chalkboard, then pushed open the door and emerged.
The sales assistant stood waiting, her face brightening the moment she appeared.
Sadie’s expression soured instantly, disgust and irritation painting her features. “These are disappointing,” she declared, flinging the garments back at the assistant with icy dismissal. “I’m leaving.”

###Chapter 1350:
She marched toward the exit with the attitude of a frustrated customer who had found nothing worth buying.
The bodyguards moved forward as Sadie stepped out, but she swept past them without acknowledgment, radiating cold indifference. She never turned around, yet as she crossed the store’s threshold, her eyes darted sideways for just an instant.
Seconds later, she vanished into the flowing river of shoppers without so much as a backward glance.
That split-second glance had carried everything she couldn’t say aloud—comfort, goodbye, and the single message she dared to send. “Noah, please wait for me.”
The moment she disappeared from view, Noah stepped out from behind a marble column.
His face had turned to stone, harder than winter frost.
He had read her glance perfectly, seeing through her brave mask to the terror lurking underneath.
He stalked into the boutique with powerful, determined steps.
The sales assistant started toward him but froze mid-step, something in his presence warning her to keep her distance, and she snapped her mouth shut.noveldrama
He made a beeline for the fitting rooms and began throwing open each door in succession.
In the third room, he discovered what he was looking for—the carpet with its telltale raised edge.
Down on one knee, Noah peeled back the carpet, his slender fingers uncovering a small note.
Curiosity quickened his hands as he opened the paper. A rush of hurried, elegant handwriting met his eyes. “Stay calm. Emerson has no intention of hurting me. Make sure you stay safe. When we meet, I’ll explain everything. Right now, I’m only pretending to yield to Emerson, and he trusts it.”
A sense of relief washed over Noah. His racing heart finally slowed as hope crept back in.
For someone in such danger, Sadie’s concern for him was almost laughable. Only she would worry about him instead of herself. Fingers tightening around the message, Noah squeezed the paper in his palm.
Rising to his full height, he turned to the bodyguard at his side. His tone was steady and unhurried. “Keep an eye on her, but don’t get too close. Make sure nothing happens to her.”
Sadie had already slipped into the backseat of a black car.

A heavy silence lingered in the air as the vehicle moved, the bodyguards seated at the front looking ahead with unreadable, stony faces.
Sadie settled deeper into the seat. She shut her eyes, and for a split second, a figure darted across her thoughts like a shadow slipping through a half-open door.
Noah looked like he had lost some weight. There was a faint paleness clinging to his skin. Even so, he still stood with his back straight and his shoulders firm.

###Chapter 1351:
Relief filled her chest, knowing that he was unharmed.
Every risk she took felt justified as long as he remained out of harm’s way.
Neon lights zipped by outside the window, casting fleeting streaks of color across the car’s interior while the city raced past. Without warning, the screech of tires shattered the quiet.
A sudden jolt threw Sadie forward as the car lurched to a stop.
No fewer than three black SUVs boxed them in. Doors burst open, and a swarm of men in black surged out, faces carved from stone and eyes filled with menace.
Immediately, the bodyguards in Sadie’s car snapped to attention.
Almost in unison, they drew their weapons. “Protect Ms. Hudson!”
Facing seasoned fighters, Emerson’s security detail wasted no time. Stepping out, they assessed the threat and plunged straight into the fray, ready for battle with the new arrivals.
Gunshots shattered the stillness of the night, the chaos echoing sharply through the darkness.
Fear gripped Sadie’s chest, squeezing so tight she could hardly breathe. She could tell at a glance that these people weren’t working for Noah. Noah’s methods were never this reckless. He always preferred strategy over force.
With the attention of everyone else riveted on the chaos outside, a spark of resolve appeared in Sadie’s eyes.
Wasting no time, she scrambled out of the back seat and slid behind the wheel.
Lucky for her, the keys remained in the ignition.
The engine leapt to life, and with one hard press on the gas, the car bolted forward, growling down the street.
A sense of hope flickered, but it vanished just as quickly. From a nearby alley, another vehicle shot out and blocked her escape with chilling precision.
Trapped from both ends, she realized she had nowhere to run.
A sinking feeling swept over her.
1E$? €?S 1? gɑlοv?l?.сo
Sweat prickled at her skin while panic clawed at her nerves. Glancing at the glove compartment, she found a dagger.
That small weapon felt like her last hope. She grabbed it, then shoved open the door and stepped outside.
Night air struck her face, bringing her senses into focus.
With her knuckles pale around the dagger’s hilt, Sadie leveled a frosty glare at the figures closing in. “Tell me who you are and what you want,” she said, her voice steady despite her racing heart.
One man stepped out from the group. He didn’t bother with deference, but he wasn’t openly hostile, either. “Mr. Afara would like a word with you.”
Afara?
That name made Sadie stiffen.
Of all people, Afara? The one who had betrayed Emerson, the same man who had nearly taken Noah’s life?
There was no reason for him to send his men after her—unless something far more dangerous was happening.
.

###Chapter 1352:
Nothing about this felt right.
Options had all but vanished for Sadie in this perilous moment. Should she go with them, or be dragged back, snared once more in Emerson’s web?
With survival on the line, she didn’t waste another second. The only move left was to cooperate, holding onto the slimmest hope for escape. After slipping the dagger out of sight, she forced her expression into an icy mask of composure.
Silent as a shadow, she allowed the new bodyguards to usher her into their vehicle, disappearing swiftly into the darkness beyond.
Unbeknownst to her, Noah’s men watched from a dimly lit car parked nearby, their eyes glued to every development.
Reacting without hesitation, the head bodyguard grabbed his phone and called Noah. “Mr. Wall, it’s urgent. Ms. Hudson has just been taken by another group. They claim Afara sent them.”noveldrama
At that very moment, chaos erupted inside Emerson’s sprawling estate. Leopard barreled into the study, frustration and fear etched across his features.
“Bad news, Emerson. Your daughter has been taken away.”
A sudden halt came over Emerson’s hands, which had been polishing a gleaming sword.
Cold rage simmered in his eyes as he raised his gaze, a dark threat hanging in the air. “Fools!”
Before anyone could move, he flung the sword with a surge of fury, its blade biting deep into the heavy wood of his desk and leaving it vibrating with the impact.
It wasn’t just because Sadie was his daughter.
More importantly, she had something Emerson had schemed for most of his life to get.
Letting Afara get hold of it was unthinkable.
Deadly resolve flashed across Emerson’s face. In a voice sharp as steel, he addressed Leopard, who stood stricken with dread.
“Spread the word. Turn over every stone. Bring her back—no matter what it takes!”
The black SUV raced through the night before screeching to a stop at West Port, where the air hung heavy with the briny scent of ocean spray.
  ?: ν．
Beneath the cloak of darkness, the dock stretched out in haunting silence, broken only by waves hammering against jagged rocks and the distant, pulsing beam of a lighthouse.
Two men clad in black hauled Sadie from the vehicle with rough efficiency.
They dragged her into a derelict warehouse where the air reeked of corroded metal and rotting fish, making Sadie’s stomach lurch violently.
A weathered table and two mismatched chairs occupied the warehouse’s center like forgotten relics.
A man wearing an extravagant silk shirt lounged with one leg draped over the other, absently flicking a metal lighter that produced sharp, rhythmic clicks.
At the sound of approaching footsteps, he raised his head, his devastatingly handsome features marked by lazy assessment.
.
.

###Chapter 1353:
The man rose gracefully, his shirt gaping open to expose a perfectly sculpted collarbone, radiating careless charm and dangerous magnetism.
He glided two steps closer to Sadie, a ghost of a smile dancing across his lips.
“Sadie Hudson, correct?” His voice carried a languid, hypnotic quality that seemed to contradict any sinister purpose. “Surrender Brenda’s files, and I’ll grant you freedom. What do you say?”
Sadie responded with nothing more than an icy stare, though her fingers betrayed her tension by gripping the edge of her blouse.
The man confronting her was Afara, the traitor who had turned against the Wolfpack, left Noah grievously wounded, and now held her captive.
He appeared harmless, almost impossibly attractive, but the predatory gleam lurking behind his warm gaze revealed a complexity that chilled her blood.
“And who exactly are you?” Sadie demanded.
Afara released a low chuckle, as though she had delivered the most delightful punchline.
He drew out a chair with theatrical courtesy, gesturing for her to sit, before sinking back into his seat with practiced nonchalance.
“I am Afara.”
Sadie remained perfectly still.
Her thoughts churned frantically, struggling to unravel the twisted situation.
Emerson coveted whatever her mother had left behind, and apparently, so did this man called Afara.
One was her blood father, the other a turncoat from Emerson’s organization.
What could they possibly be hunting with such desperate determination?
She jolted back to the present, her stare piercing Afara like a blade seeking its target.
“The Wolfpack craves it, and so do you. Who are you serving?”

Afara lifted his shoulders in a gesture of innocence. “I never saw eye to eye with that stubborn old fool Emerson, so I’m pursuing my own interests. Everyone protects their skin—it’s simply human nature.”
He delivered these words as though discussing the weather, yet Sadie refused to accept even a syllable of his explanation.
She had escaped one predator’s lair only to stumble into another’s trap. Now, it became clear that Afara posed an equal threat to Emerson. No, Afara might prove even more lethal than Emerson.
Emerson’s brutality and hunger for dominance were openly apparent, but Afara remained shrouded in enigmatic shadows that concealed his true intentions.
“It cannot possibly be that straightforward!” Sadie scoffed with contempt.
Her gaze accidentally shifted to his upraised arm.noveldrama
The sleeve of his ostentatious silk shirt had shifted, exposing a small section of skin at his wrist.
A tattoo marked the spot—a black bat with wings outstretched, poised for flight.
Despite its modest size, the design displayed remarkable intricacy, each line carved with razor precision.
.

.
###Chapter 1354:
Sadie’s pupils constricted violently at the sight.
This symbol…
Could this be the mark of Zupren’s government death commandos? Sadie had encountered this very symbol among the classified documents her grandfather had left behind.
It served as the emblem of Zupren’s most clandestine special forces unit, the “Night Bats”—elite operatives tempered in the fires of violence and mortality, assigned to execute the most classified government missions.
Her grandfather had warned her that witnessing this mark was equivalent to stumbling upon a lethal state weapon. Could Afara possibly be an agent of the Zupren government?
The realization crashed through Sadie’s consciousness like a thunderbolt, detonating in her brain. The revelations flooded her system, too massive to digest immediately, and she dared not react impulsively.
If Afara worked for the government, why employ such brutal tactics? Why had he attacked Noah so viciously?
Sadie found herself unable to trust anyone—neither Emerson nor this mysterious figure known as Afara.
Drawing a steadying breath, she wrestled the tempest of emotions into submission, her expression hardening into cold resolve.
“If you plan to corrupt my mother’s legacy for malicious purposes, I would rather die than surrender it to you.”
Her voice, though barely above a whisper, rang with unwavering conviction, reverberating through the hollow warehouse.
“The same goes for Emerson.”
She raised her chin defiantly, locking eyes with Afara’s mesmerizing gaze with fierce determination.
“I demand to speak with your superior,” Sadie declared.
Afara found himself genuinely taken aback.
He arched one eyebrow, a brief spark of amazement flickering across his magnetic gaze.

The young woman standing before him possessed far keener instincts than he had anticipated.
A single accidental glimpse of his tattoo had guided her to such a startling deduction. Emerson’s daughter and Absolon’s granddaughter, Sadie, was no common adversary.
“I am not Emerson’s daughter.”
Sadie’s frigid tone sliced through Afara’s contemplation.
Her stare remained steady, blazing with glacial determination. “I am simply Sadie Hudson. Noah Wall’s wife. My father bears the name Dederick Hudson.”
Every word Sadie spoke felt like severing ties with her past.
Sadie wanted Afara to see clearly—she wasn’t some pawn to be moved at his convenience, and she certainly wasn’t an extension of the ruthless Emerson. She stood on her own. She had her own name, her own life, and people she was determined to protect.

###Chapter 1355:
Afara leaned back in his chair, his smile deepening. He tapped his fingers against the table in a slow, deliberate rhythm, as if weighing the weight behind her words.
Still, he hesitated.
Bringing her to meet his superior posed too many risks.
One slip, and everything he’d worked for could collapse.
Sadie noticed the flicker of doubt.
She took a step forward and met his gaze head-on.
“You can think it over,” she said quietly. Her voice was soft, but it pressed in like a warning.
“But Emerson’s people probably already know I’m gone. It won’t be long before they come looking. How long do you think you can hide from them?”
Afara’s fingers stopped mid-tap.
She was right—and they both knew it.
She was gambling on his fear. On the fact that he wouldn’t dare expose himself to Emerson’s wrath. That he couldn’t risk the failure of this operation.
And she was correct.
Taking her was like holding a grenade with the pin already pulled; she might bring the whole place down with her. To break the stalemate, he had to take a risk.
“Alright,” Afara said at last. He gave in.
But then, the warehouse doors slammed open with a jarring clang. A guard burst in, breathless and wide-eyed. “Mr. Afara! Noah’s men are here!”noveldrama
Sadie’s heart seized.
She didn’t even think—her body moved first. She stepped in front of the entrance, arms spread as if shielding someone. “Don’t hurt him!” Her voice shook as it left her mouth.
Afara raised an eyebrow at her stance. Then he let out a dry chuckle.
“Relax.”
He stood slowly, brushing imaginary dust from the cuffs of his brightly patterned shirt.

“I don’t intend to make an enemy of Mr. Wall.”
Afara gave a small nod toward the men by the door. “Since he came in person, let him through.”
Minutes later, Noah stepped inside.
His presence was unmistakable—cold and commanding—but the moment he saw Sadie safe, something shifted in his eyes. The edge in his stare softened, just a little. His gaze moved past her, fixing on the man with a smirk. He recognized Afara immediately. He would spot Afara anywhere.
Before anything could explode, Sadie darted forward. She grabbed Noah’s arm, tugging him aside.
Her hand was clammy; her grip trembled with urgency.
She lowered her voice to a whisper only he could hear. “Afara might be working for the Zupren government.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1356:noveldrama
The words slammed into Noah like a steel weight. His jaw tightened.
His eyes narrowed.
Zupren government?
Afara was with the government?
It didn’t make sense.
Yet Sadie looked up at him with a steady fire in her eyes. She wasn’t guessing. She believed it.
Noah didn’t answer. He couldn’t—not right away.
Sadie saw the doubt on his face. She continued, more quietly this time, “I saw the tattoo on his wrist. The mark of the Night Bats. It’s in my grandfather’s files—I know I’m not wrong. The Wolfpack’s an international crime syndicate. Zupren…”
“Government’s been hunting them for years. This could be our chance to flee,” she said. She was trying to convince Noah—but also herself.
They were placing everything on a single bet. If they were right, they had a chance at freedom.
If not, the fallout would crush them both.
Noah paused, deep in thought.
He turned to Sadie, studying her pale face and the unwavering resolve in her eyes.
After a moment, he gave a slow nod.
Whatever dangers lay ahead, he would trust her.
He would follow her lead.
Noah kept his eyes on her and made up his mind.
As the three prepared to leave, the warehouse doors burst open. A bodyguard stumbled in, his face stricken with fear. “Mr. Afara! It’s bad—White Tiger and his men are here!”
Afara’s usual smirk vanished.
He cursed under his breath.
Full chapters on g?νc?
White Tiger—second-in-command of the Wolfpack and Emerson’s most loyal enforcer—was infamous for his brutal precision.
Afara hadn’t expected him to show up so soon.
Without a second thought, he grabbed Sadie and Noah and shoved them toward the car parked by the back entrance. “Go! Now!” he barked at the driver. He didn’t follow.
Instead, he drew a sleek black pistol from his waist and turned to face the shadows flooding through the entrance.
Gunfire erupted, echoing through the vast, empty warehouse.
The car shot forward like a bolt released from a bowstring.
Sadie turned back instinctively. Through the rear window, she caught a glimpse of Afara’s silhouette swallowed by fire and chaos. Her heart felt tightly gripped by an unseen force.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1357:
Only moments ago, Afara had nearly killed Noah. Now, he was laying down his life to secure their escape.
It didn’t feel real.
Noah pulled her close, one hand pressing gently against the back of hers, his presence steady and firm.
In the flickering blur of streetlights, his profile looked carved from steel—unyielding.
Zupren government. Night Bats. Afara…
Whatever the truth was, Noah knew only one thing: he had to keep Sadie safe.
Half an hour later, the car came to a stop outside a nondescript building called Pearl Apartments.
The driver guided them straight to the seventh floor.
The door to unit 707 opened from within.
Inside stood several middle-aged men in suits, their faces calm but watchful. Their eyes—sharp and seasoned—held the weight of authority.
As soon as Sadie and Noah stepped in, every gaze turned to her, laced with curiosity, scrutiny, and a hint of urgency.
The man who appeared to be the leader stepped forward. “Nice to meet you, Ms. Hudson.”
His voice was deep, firm—leaving no room for negotiation. “The research data left by Ms. Brenda Stewart is vital. Not just to us, but to the entire nation.”
He didn’t waste time with pleasantries.
“Whatever your conditions are, name them. If they are within our power, we’ll meet them.”
Sadie met his gaze, her expression composed. She looked untouched by the chase she had just survived.
She didn’t respond right away. Instead, she crossed the room and took a seat on the sofa.noveldrama
Noah stood behind her like a sentinel, his presence cold and impenetrable.
He said nothing. The choice was hers.
 ? ? ?．
Sadie glanced around the room, her eyes cool and steady as they met each pair of eyes.
“Before we discuss terms, I have questions.”
Her voice was soft, yet it rang through the stillness with unshakable clarity.
“What really happened at the NE Research Institute? Why did my mother have to hide for so long, carrying something this important?” She paused, then spoke again.
Again—each word sharp, deliberate. “And what role did the Lawson family play in all of this?”
The final words she spoke landed like a stone in still water. The room turned to ice.
The officials, who just moments ago held themselves with quiet command, visibly flinched at the mention of the Lawson family. They exchanged quick glances—shock flickering across their faces, chased by hesitation.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1358:
This wasn’t what they expected. The web ran deeper than they were prepared to admit.
That Brenda’s daughter knew this much unsettled them more than they cared to admit.
And now, they were caught—unsure whether to speak or withhold the truth.
If they did decide to speak, where could they even begin?
One of them cleared his throat, his voice uncertain, weighed down by caution.
“Ms. Hudson, the story is long. And difficult.” His voice wavered with hesitation.
Sadie stood, her voice rising, clear and unyielding. “If you want the data, I’ll give it to you. But I need answers. All of them. If not, I’ll destroy it before I let it fall into the wrong hands.”
“Ms. Hudson, please—” another man interrupted, his tone urgent.noveldrama
“We’ll tell you everything. You have our word.”
Sadie said nothing, her eyes locked on the man with an intensity that seemed to sift through every word he uttered, silently searching for cracks in the truth.
Her silence pressed against the walls like a storm waiting to break, thickening the air in the room.
Finally, the man leading the group exhaled, the sound heavy with reluctant resolve.
“Very well. You want answers—then you’ll have them.”
He motioned for the others to take their seats but remained standing himself, his gaze drifting somewhere far beyond the present. “The NE Research Institute was founded in secret over two decades ago,” he said, his voice hollowed by memory. “It was a collaboration among elite biologists from across the globe, all united by one obsession—genetic engineering.”
He drew a slow breath, his expression darkening. “Your mother, Brenda, was the youngest among them—but also their linchpin. Together, they created a drug that didn’t just halt human cell growth—it could reverse it. And as they pushed further, they gathered an immense archive of human genetic data—data born from countless experiments in modification.”
He stopped for a beat, his voice tightening as he continued, this time with solemn weight. “If that data were ever exposed—or worse, weaponized—the fallout would be catastrophic. It holds the potential to save countless lives… but in the wrong hands, it could become humanity’s worst nightmare. Emerson, from the Wolfpack, somehow caught wind of the project. He wormed his way into your mother’s life, posing as a charming suitor—but it was all a facade.” A bitter frown tugged at his lips, and he let out a weary sigh.
“He had one goal: to seize that data for himself. Once Brenda realized what he was after, she didn’t hesitate. She destroyed parts of the institute’s archives and escaped back to her homeland with what mattered most.”
Each word landed like a hammer against Sadie’s chest.
Everything he was saying aligned with the puzzle pieces she’d gathered from her investigation.
g?ν. – ?  
“And the Lawson Family?” Her voice was steady, but the question carried the weight of everything she feared.
A flicker of guilt crossed the man’s face.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1359:
“Emerson suspected the Lawson family, who was among the institute’s backers, possibly held backup copies of the data. After your mother fled, he redirected his efforts toward them…”
Obsession… toward them. The chairman of Lawson Group and his wife paid the ultimate price—hounded until death. Silence smothered the room.
Even the wind that stirred the curtains seemed unable to lift the crushing stillness.
Noah gently reached for Sadie’s hand, now icy and limp in her lap.
She looked composed, unreadable even—but beneath the surface, a storm howled, raw and relentless.
The man’s account flowed seamlessly—too seamlessly. It painted Emerson as the sole villain, carefully exonerating everyone else. But Brenda had been no fool. She was sharp, discerning, always two steps ahead.
If she had seen through Emerson’s carefully crafted mask, how could she have missed the deeper currents swirling beneath the surface? And if these people were truly patriots—defenders of their country and its people—then why hadn’t Brenda chosen to seek their help back then?
Why entrust her only child to her mother rather than leave the so-called *”crucial” data in these people’s care?
That choice alone revealed everything.
Sadie didn’t believe a word of it.noveldrama
Her mother hadn’t trusted them back then—and neither did she now.
She lifted her head slowly, her gaze locking with the leader’s probing eyes.
“So that’s how it is,” she murmured, her tone unreadable, smooth as glass.
She looked down at her hand resting in Noah’s—finding comfort in his warmth.
“I can give you the data,” she said at last.
At her declaration, a flicker of excitement ignited in the room—eyes sharpened, postures subtly leaned forward.
g?ν.0′ ?  
“But…” Sadie paused, her voice gaining an icy precision as she raised her gaze once more, and continued, “Not immediately. My mother designed an elaborate, multilayered verification system to protect the data. It can only be accessed at a very specific time—and that time is seven days from now.”
Her tone was steady, authoritative—leaving no space for negotiation. The leader’s expression darkened with thought, his brow knitting as he tried to gauge her sincerity.
Seven days. Not long enough to raise alarm. Not short enough to be impulsive.
Around him, the higher-ups exchanged brief, pointed glances—an entire conversation spoken without words. They had hunted this trail for so many years.
What was another week, especially with the girl already in hand?
“Very well. Seven days it is.”
The leader gave a final nod, sealing the arrangement with an air of authority.
“For the next seven days, you’ll stay here with Mr. Wall—for your safety,” he said. “We’ll assign a detail to protect you both.”

###Chapter 1360:
“Okay.” Sadie didn’t flinch. Her response was measured, almost indifferent.
Without further delay, the officials rose and made their exit, their shoes echoing against the floor until the soft click of the door restored silence to the apartment.
The tension that had bound the room finally unraveled, leaving a heavy fatigue in its wake.
Sadie slowly let go of Noah’s hand, as if severing a lifeline, then rose to her feet.
She walked toward the floor-to-ceiling window, its glass pane revealing a sweeping view of the city below—intersecting roads, distant cars, people drifting like specks.noveldrama
But her eyes weren’t on the skyline.
They dropped lower, honing in on the building’s shadowy edges—where men in civilian clothes stood idly, pretending to smoke, to chat, to wait.
The men’s placements were too precise to be coincidence. They didn’t just happen to linger near exits—they occupied them.
Their eyes, though feigning disinterest, flicked subtly toward the windows, the lobby, the entryways.
This wasn’t protection.
The watch had already begun.
No—custody.
A faint sneer curled at the edge of Sadie’s lips.
Of course it wouldn’t be that simple.
Noah stepped beside her, his eyes scanning the same corners. He saw it too—the stiff postures, the manufactured casualness, the sharpness masked behind neutral expressions.
He slipped his hand over hers, trying to warm her fingers.
“They’re not guards,” he murmured, his voice low and grim.
The meeting earlier might have looked like a civil negotiation, but he could feel it—an undercurrent of threat beneath every polite word. They smiled and nodded, draped in patriotism and principle, but their eyes betrayed something else—hunger, calculation.
They were no better than Emerson.
Discover where it all happens: g?lnσν?s?c?m
One used brute force, the other manipulation—but both were ready to break bones for that data.
This so-called safe house was just a prettier prison. Emerson had his estate. These people had state backing. Same game. Different uniforms.
Noah’s jaw tightened.
He needed to get Sadie out—fast.
Sadie turned toward him, her eyes finding his.
In his gaze, she saw her own thoughts reflected back—sharp, untrusting, resolute.
She gave a slight shake of her head.
“Of course I know,” Sadie said quietly, her voice edged with fatigue—but beneath it was steel, a sharp clarity born of harsh truth.

“These people can’t be trusted.”
She hadn’t believed Emerson’s twisted words—but neither did she buy the rehearsed concern of the so-called officials in tailored suits. Her mother had been too perceptive, too strategic, to miss the signs. She hadn’t fled out of fear—she ran because she knew the system she once busted had turned into a snare. Sadie saw that now more clearly than ever.
Her mother hadn’t trusted anyone—because both sides of the board were rigged.
Emerson’s pursuit was merciless. The others cloaked theirs in law, loyalty, and promises of justice. But a trap was still a trap, no matter how it was dressed.
And now, Sadie stood at the same crossroads her mother once had—hunted from one side, manipulated from the other, with nowhere safe to turn.
Except this time, she wasn’t alone.
She glanced at Noah. That was the difference—she had him.
“Whether it’s Emerson or them…” Sadie’s voice trailed off for a moment, but her eyes burned with purpose. “They’re all after what my mother left behind.” She straightened, as if anchoring herself to a decision. “But this is my chance—to dig up the truth.”
The secrets of the NE Research Institute had haunted her like shadows.
Why had her mother become a target?
What tied the Lawson family to it all?
The answers had always been just out of reach—tangled threads in a web she couldn’t unravel.
But now, one thread had come loose.
And she intended to pull it, no matter where it led.
Even if the truth lay hidden in darkness, even if it meant plunging into danger, she would follow it to the end.
She knew those people wouldn’t make any rash moves now. They were cautious, and they desperately wanted the data that was supposed to be given to them in seven days.
They wouldn’t act rashly now, not while the prize was still beyond reach. That gave her time and power.
 : gν﹒
Noah studied her—the fierce resolve in her gaze, the unwavering calm in her stance.
There was no fear, no doubt. Only fire.
He clasped her hand, his grip steady, warming her chilled fingers one by one.
“All right,” he said softly, a vow wrapped in a single word.
Noah said just two words, but they landed with the weight of a thousand.
Whatever Sadie intended to do, he would walk beside her.noveldrama
If the road ahead turned treacherous, he’d clear it.
If danger approached, he’d take the hit.
He would no longer let her stand alone.

###Chapter 1362:
And in that moment, something in Sadie settled. It felt like stumbling across water in the heart of a desert.
She turned to Noah, her lips forming a small, quiet smile. Barely there—but it broke through the heaviness like sunlight breaking past the clouds.
“They think locking me in here makes me obey,” she said. “But this cage can’t hold me.”
She stepped away and crossed the room, lifting the phone from its cradle.
“I need a laptop and some design tools,” she said, her tone steady—like she was placing a regular order and not preparing for something far bigger.
“And I’m hungry. Send over a few dishes from Yasmine’s Kitchen on the west side.”
She listed off some dishes without hesitation.
There was a pause on the line—mild surprise, but the reply came promptly. “Understood, Ms. Hudson. We’ll have them sent at once.”
When Sadie hung up and turned around, she found Noah watching her with a look of quiet curiosity.noveldrama
She blinked once, and a flicker of humor passed over her otherwise guarded face.
“You can’t take on the world on an empty stomach.”
Meanwhile, at Emerson’s estate, the study door burst open with a violent crack.
White Tiger entered, dragging a bloodied man behind him, his arms bound tight. He flung the man forward, and the man hit the carpet hard.
The man raised his head slowly. A smear of red clung to the corner of his mouth, staining the collar of his once-flashy shirt.
It was Afara.
He looked terrible, but his eyes still burned with that same untamed defiance.
Emerson loomed behind his desk. His face was stone-cold, shadowed by fury.
Her sword remained stabbed into the wood before him, the polished hilt gleaming beneath the light—silent and menacing, just like him. For years, Emerson had believed he had Afara under his thumb—a skilled young man shaped by control and ambition.
He had admired Afara’s methods, even fed his ambition, never once imagining that the wolf he kept close had long pledged loyalty elsewhere.
Unforgettable stories on g?lnσν?so
Emerson loathed betrayal more than anything.
“I never thought you’d turn on me,” he said, his voice low, trembling with barely contained fury.
The corner of Afara’s mouth twitched into something resembling a smile. The movement pulled at his wounds, but he didn’t flinch.
He met Emerson’s glare head-on and scoffed.
“Turn on you?” he said. “You give yourself too much credit. I was never loyal to you.”
Emerson froze for a beat. Then, his rage cracked into a bitter laugh.
“Oh, so you were never loyal to me, huh?”
He circled the desk, each step deliberate and heavy, his shoes soundless against the carpet but steeped in menace. “You and your people have schemed for years. And now you lay hands on my daughter? You really think I’ll just stand by?”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1363:
A flicker of disdain passed through Afara’s eyes.
To him, it was laughable.
Emerson only saw what suited him. He twisted the truth, cast blame outward, and played the victim.
And when he mentioned his daughter—it wasn’t out of love. It was as if something he owned had been defiled.
But how had he treated the woman who bore that child?
“We’re cut from the same cloth,” Afara said coldly. “You murdered Brenda for a set of files. You chased her across the world. You think I’m ruthless? I could never reach your level.”
Hearing Brenda’s name made Emerson feel like a wound being ripped open.
Emerson crouched down suddenly, seizing Afara by the collar and yanking him off the floor.noveldrama
For the first time, his hardened expression cracked—rage bleeding through, combined with something raw and unguarded.
“Shut up!” His voice exploded, eyes burning red.
“I did it to protect her. You were the ones who wanted her dead, rats hiding in the dark!”
Emerson lost control, his voice rising to a shout as he dragged the past back into the light.
“If your people hadn’t chased her, she wouldn’t have run off with the child. You destroyed the NE Research Institute. You silenced every witness. Didn’t you do those? Answer me!”
So, Emerson knew the truth. Afara’s eyes flickered—not with surprise, but with confirmation. Emerson had always been sharp. He wasn’t blind to the truth; he had simply rewritten it to suit himself. That way, he could live with it. Maybe even believe it.
There was no need to pretend anymore.
The smirk fell away from Afara’s face, replaced by a cold, unwavering determination.
“We did what we had to—for the greater good. You wouldn’t understand. You’ve always acted out of greed.”
Emerson laughed, hollow and bitter.
L?t?st ?hαpt?rs in glnovl.o
The greater good? That excuse had cost lives. It had cost Brenda.
“Where is she?” he asked, his voice low and lethal. “Where have you taken Sadie?”
Emerson’s bloodshot eyes bored into the room as tension suffocated the air around him.
His fingers dug into Afara’s collar, veins bulging across his knuckles like twisted ropes ready to snap.
The greater good?
Such grand plans meant nothing to Emerson when it came to what truly mattered.
Right now, only one thing consumed his thoughts: bringing his daughter home after nearly thirty long years of separation.
.
.

###Chapter 1364:
The explosive atmosphere shattered as the study door burst open again. White Tiger rushed inside, his face a canvas of urgency mixed with barely contained excitement. “Sir, we’ve located your daughter.”
Emerson’s death grip on Afara froze mid-squeeze before releasing entirely, his attention snapping to White Tiger. “Where is she?” Murderous rage transformed instantly into desperate hope as finding Sadie became his singular focus.
The half-dead traitor bleeding on the floor ceased to exist in his world. Nothing else mattered beyond reaching his daughter; everything else could burn for all he cared.
Afara dragged himself upright, blood trickling from his split lip as a sardonic grin spread across his battered face. “So what if you’ve found her?”
His voice came out raw and mocking, each word dripping with cruel certainty.
“Emerson, I advise you not to waste your efforts. Unless she willingly surrenders what they’re after, not even the full might of the Wolfpack will be enough to bring her back alive.”
Emerson’s foot had barely lifted when he stopped dead in his tracks.
He whirled around and fixed Afara with a stare that could cut steel. Those taunting words rekindled the volcanic rage simmering beneath his surface.
Forward he lunged, seizing Afara’s collar again and hauling him clean off the floor.
His clenched fist trembled with barely restrained violence, wind whistling around his knuckles.noveldrama
“Sir!” White Tiger’s voice cut through the moment like a whip crack. “He’s still useful for us.”
Glancing at Afara, who showed no fear even while dangling in Emerson’s iron grip, White Tiger dropped his voice to a whisper. “We can use him to trade for your daughter’s return.”
Exchanging a high-ranking organization member for Sadie made perfect sense from every angle worth considering.
White Tiger’s reminder gave Emerson pause.
Trading Afara’s worthless life for Sadie’s freedom appeared to be the only viable path forward.
Storming their place with brute force had crossed Emerson’s mind more than once. Yet he knew firsthand just how merciless the people pulling Afara’s strings could be.
Lαττ ?нαρτ?rs ιn glov?l.om
Ruthless didn’t begin to describe them—they were calculating predators who’d sacrifice anyone to reach their ives.
Push them into a corner, and Sadie would pay the ultimate price for his recklessness.
“Gee…” Afara caught that flicker of uncertainty in Emerson’s eyes and let out a dark chuckle. “Trade?”
The word rolled off his tongue like he’d just heard the world’s most pathetic joke.
“Emerson, you’re more foolish than I thought. What makes you think they’d lift a finger to save my skin? I’m nothing but a disposable piece on their chessboard, replaceable within the hour. When it comes to their grand design, my life holds less value than dirt.”
.
.
.
###Chapter 1365:
Emerson’s fingers tightened around his throat like a vise.
The fearless gleam in Afara’s eyes—almost eager, as if welcoming death—sent ice through Emerson’s veins.
Deep down, Emerson knew Afara spoke the truth. Those lunatics wouldn’t bat an eye at losing an expendable foot soldier.
What consumed their twisted minds was the files Brenda had hidden away.
Offering Afara as trade bait would only earn him their mockery. Emerson’s grip loosened, sending Afara crashing back onto the plush carpet with a dull thud.
Murderous rage ebbed from his features, replaced by the cold wheels of strategy turning behind his eyes.
Indeed. How could one worthless pawn ever measure against his precious daughter’s life?
Using such an insignificant piece to take a risk would be beyond foolish. Emerson began prowling the length of his study, leather soles making no sound against the thick carpet.
Only his ragged breathing and the weight of desperate silence filled the room.noveldrama
A bulletproof strategy had to emerge from this chaos—one that would guarantee Sadie’s safety while keeping those monsters in check.
Charging in guns blazing was suicide.
Hostage exchanges were even more pointless.
Those people showed no fear of the Wolfpack’s reputation, but there was one name that made them think twice.
Noah.
The realization struck Emerson like a bolt from the blue.
Noah’s devotion to Sadie matched his own fierce protectiveness.
Beyond that, Wall Group’s tentacles reached deep into Zupren’s very foundations, commanding respect in both legitimate circles and the shadow world.
   at ν﹒
Certain delicate operations lay beyond the Wolfpack’s reach, yet Wall Group could handle them with surgical precision.
Bringing Wall Group into the fold would prove far more efficient and secure than charging ahead alone.
Emerson froze mid-stride, steely resolve crystallizing in his rigid posture.
A calculated strategy had formed in his mind.
He pivoted toward White Tiger, his voice dropping to a commanding whisper. “Contact that physician—Dr. Lawson. He was with Noah, right? Instruct him to relay a message to Wall Group: Sadie has fallen into the hands of our enemies.”
White Tiger hesitated briefly before comprehension dawned across his features. Emerson intended to orchestrate a collision between the Wall family and their shadowy adversaries while the Wolfpack harvested the rewards from their mutual destruction.
The tactic was their most advantageous option under current circumstances.
“Perfectly clear, sir. I’ll execute this immediately.” White Tiger departed the chamber with swift efficiency.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1366:
Silence settled over the study, leaving only Emerson standing and Afara sprawled motionless on the polished floor.
Emerson’s eyes descended upon the fallen man with profound contempt, his stare carrying the frigid detachment reserved for examining corpses.
“Remove him from my sight,” Emerson directed the sentinel positioned at the entrance, “but ensure he continues breathing.” The treacherous fool retained value despite his betrayal.
Emerson required intimate knowledge of every part Afara had performed throughout the preceding twenty years.
Most crucially, he intended to drain every fragment of information concerning Brenda from the man’s reluctant lips.
Hurst stumbled back into Noah’s hotel room empty-handed, his body weighted down by bone-deep fatigue and crushing disappointment. The room greeted him with hollow emptiness—Noah’s absence hung in the stagnant air.
Dread crashed over him like a suffocating wave.
Noah never vanished without explanation unless circumstances had spiraled beyond his control.
Had Emerson’s operatives finally caught up with them, or had those mysterious figures emerged from the darkness?
Both scenarios spelled disaster for his precarious situation.
Restlessness drove him to action as he seized his jacket. Determination overrode caution as he prepared to venture into the dangerous night.
The moment he yanked the door open, multiple figures materialized before him—men clad in dark tank tops, their muscled arms decorated with intricate tattoos, forming an impenetrable barrier across his sole escape route. Menace radiated from their very stance.
Hurst’s heart plummeted into his stomach with sickening speed.
Survival instincts kicked in as he retreated one careful step, his fingers sliding stealthily toward the weapon concealed behind his back.
The apparent leader’s mouth stretched into a predatory smile, exposing gleaming teeth that contrasted sharply with the arctic coldness dwelling in his calculating eyes.
“Dr. Lawson, there’s no need for anxiety. Our boss simply requests the pleasure of your help.”noveldrama
  ? ? ?ν
Within the confines of Unit 707 at Pearl Apartments, Sadie and Noah had endured captivity for what felt like endless hours.
Every level above and beneath their position, including the structure across the street, crawled with operatives deployed by shadowy government authorities.
An impenetrable web of surveillance had descended upon the entire area, sealing every possible escape route.
Sadie positioned herself near the window, her features maintaining perfect composure while her thoughts churned at breakneck speed.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1367:
The laptop and tools she requested would arrive soon.
The elaborate meal she had ordered from Yasmine’s Kitchen—strategically chosen for its location on the city’s opposite edge—would require substantial time to reach them.
Her calculated demands served dual purposes: testing her captors’ resources while purchasing precious additional time.noveldrama
She planned to transform this supposed sanctuary into a weapon for unveiling every concealed enemy lurking in the shadows.
Noah maintained his position several paces behind her, his penetrating gaze locked onto her every movement with unwavering intensity.
Coiled tension radiated through his frame. He resembled a predator poised to unleash devastating force at the first opportunity.
His tactical mind had cataloged every escape route and security device throughout the structure with obsessive precision.
Precisely when their options seemed exhausted, the heavily secured entrance burst open with startling abruptness.
Both prisoners pivoted with careful deliberation to assess this unexpected development.
The silhouette framed in the doorway rendered them speechless with shock.
Hurst stood before them—an impossible sight!
What circumstances could have possibly brought him to this heavily guarded location?
Sadie and Noah’s eyes met in a moment of shared bewilderment, each recognizing their mutual disbelief reflected in the other’s stunned expression.
The Hurst before them bore little resemblance to the somewhat fumbling, anxious physician they had known.
Dressed in an impeccably cut charcoal suit with perfectly styled hair, he radiated refined elegance and dangerous confidence—a masterfully crafted persona concealing his authentic identity.
Hurst met Noah’s and Sadie’s curious stares with ease, not a flicker of tension in his expression. Instead, he gave them a discreet wink—subtle, but deliberate.
Was he trying to signal something?

Without another word, he stepped forward and, to everyone’s surprise, offered Noah and Sadie a deep, respectful bow. His movements were smooth and composed, radiating poise and professionalism.
“Mr. Wall. Ms. Hudson, please forgive my late arrival,” he said clearly, his voice calm and authoritative. “The closing ceremony for the Wall Group’s international conference is about to begin. All the delegates are assembled and awaiting your presence as hosts. Please, allow me to escort you back.”
The air shifted. Hurst’s words were delivered with impeccable timing and precision—offering a polite excuse while simultaneously unveiling their high-profile identities. There was no room for dispute, no time for delay. His statement made it abundantly clear: they needed to leave now.
Sadie caught on instantly.
This was a carefully crafted performance—an orchestrated exit strategy wrapped in ceremony.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1368:
Sadie saw right through it but chose not to expose Hurst. Instead, she stood still, her expression icy and unreadable, silently waiting to see how he intended to play this out.
Just then, several senior officials from Zupren emerged from the inner chamber, drawn by the murmurs and shifting tension in the room.
The man at the helm froze mid-step at the sight before him.
The Wall Group. Of course, they knew the name. Everyone did. A corporate titan whose reach extended far beyond borders.
Sadie had already grasped the scale of what Hurst had invoked.
The Wall Group’s international conference wasn’t just a business event—it was a stage for deals worth billions, influencing national economies. Zupren alone held a major stake, and the ripple effects touched even the local GDP.
The closing ceremony, though brief in form, was the final seal—the moment of formalizing strategic collaborations under the Wall Group’s stewardship.
No wonder the officials’ demeanor shifted so quickly.
It wasn’t about pride anymore—it was about interest.
Detaining Noah and Sadie now—drawing the ire of the forces backing the Wall family—was a risk none of them could afford.
The leader did the math in seconds. Risk. Benefit. Leverage. Then, as if someone flipped a switch, his face softened into a wide, almost cloying smile.noveldrama
“Oh, Mr. Wall, Ms. Hudson,” he said in a tone suddenly warm and full of contrition.
He approached swiftly, bowing slightly in an exaggerated show of politeness. “We must apologize. It seems we haven’t been considerate enough.” With practiced grace, he continued, “Since the conference demands your attention, perhaps you should return and handle the situation without delay.”
He paused, then gave Sadie a loaded look—half-respectful, half-calculating. “After all, there’s still a week left. No need to rush. We’ll be here… ready to assist whenever you return.”
His words were elegant but layered with meaning. A graceful exit, yes—but also a clear message: Noah and Sadie were free to go, but the clock was ticking and Brenda’s files were expected to be delivered without fail.
Sadie’s lips curved into a faint, unreadable smile.
She didn’t speak—just tilted her head slightly and glanced at Noah, silently passing him the reins.
Every tale finds a home at g?lnσνs?com
Noah rose from his seat, his gaze settling on Hurst with quiet intensity. Hurst remained stoic, his head respectfully bowed, revealing nothing.
Not emotion, not intent—only disciplined deference.
Noah knew better than to trust too quickly.
Hurst’s sudden appearance and carefully timed rescue were suspicious, almost too convenient.
But for now, there was no alternative. They were cornered, and Hurst was the only door still open.
After a pause, Noah’s eyes flicked away. He slipped an arm around Sadie’s shoulder and said, with cool detachment, “Lead the way.” Without another word, the two of them followed Hurst out, stepping into uncertainty cloaked in control.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1369:
Sadie remained quiet, letting herself be guided. It wasn’t until they were in the car, the doors shut and the chaos behind them, that her mind began to churn.
So many questions remained unanswered.
Emerson’s camp, Zupren authorities—both sides had cards hidden up their sleeves.
Each faction wielded its power like a blade, and neither of them could be trusted. The weight of their games pressed on her chest.
Then she felt Noah’s hand wrap around hers—steady, warm, grounding.
“These factions… they’ll never mix. If we stay here, we play by their rules. We need to go home. That’s our ground. Our game. If they want something from us—they’ll have to come knocking.”
Every word was calmly delivered, sharp with clarity and layered with strategy. He wasn’t just observing—he was already planning.
Sadie looked at him for a long moment, then gave a small nod. He was right. Here, they were outmaneuvered at every turn.
Back at home, they had leverage. Influence. Power.
And then, as her thoughts settled into the new direction, a memory surfaced.
She turned slightly in her seat and looked to the front.
“Hurst,” Sadie said, her voice calm but sharp, “how did you know the details about the conference?”
Her gaze was steady, unblinking. Given Hurst’s former position, there was no logical way he could have known anything about the Wall Group’s internal affairs—let alone the schedule of its confidential summit.
Caught off guard, Hurst hesitated.
His posture stiffened, and he avoided her eyes, fumbling for a response.noveldrama
“It was… Mr. Castro,” he finally said, voice uneven. “He called and, uh, mentioned it to me.”
The answer was weak—unconvincing at best. Even his tone betrayed him. It was clearly a lie. Noah didn’t miss it.
He watched Hurst carefully, silently filing the moment away. There was more to this man than he let on.
Explore new chapters g?lησνs?com
But now wasn’t the time to dig. Pushing for answers would only cause ripples—ripples their enemies might notice. Right now, the priority was Sadie’s safety.
So Noah said nothing, keeping his suspicions close.
By dawn, their plane touched down at Jazmah International Airport. The whirlwind of travel, stress, and suppressed emotion had taken its toll on Sadie.
As she stepped off the plane, a wave of dizziness washed over her. Her vision flickered to black for a moment, and she staggered slightly. Noah was there in an instant. Without hesitation, his arms wrapped around her, lifting her effortlessly into his embrace.
She didn’t protest. Her body was too drained.
Her head rested against his chest as the weight of the past few days caught up with her.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1370:
He moved swiftly through the terminal, never loosening his grip. The waiting car was already parked at the curb. He settled into the back seat with her still in his arms.
“To Myrtlewood Estate,” he said firmly. The driver nodded in response, and the sleek black vehicle eased into traffic, carrying them home.
After a full night’s rest, the haze of fatigue finally began to lift from Sadie’s body.
Her limbs still felt heavy, but the sharp edge of exhaustion had dulled. She was about to close her eyes again when a burst of raised voices drifted up from downstairs.
Sadie sighed, rubbing her temples. With effort, she pushed off the covers and made her way down.
“Noah, tell me straight—how is Sadie?” Blaine’s voice rang out, tight with worry.
Noah didn’t answer him. His attention was fixed instead on Hurst, who stood rigidly, eyes downcast.
“At this point,” Noah said coldly, “are you still not going to tell me who gave you the order?”
Cornered, Hurst exhaled slowly, clearly aware the truth couldn’t be buried any longer.
“It was Emerson,” he answered. “After the two of you were taken, Emerson dispatched a team to find Ms. Hudson… and they managed to capture Afara.”
“What did you just say?”
The sharp voice cut through the room like a blade.
Everyone turned. Sadie stood at the foot of the stairs, her expression tight with disbelief.
She could barely process it. That Emerson would go to such lengths for her? It didn’t make sense.
As soon as Sadie appeared, all eyes snapped to her.
A washed-out complexion and loose loungewear made her look delicate, but her gaze cut through the room like a blade.noveldrama
No matter how he tried, Hurst couldn’t help but shrink back from her glare. A coldness ran down his spine, and he found it impossible to meet her eyes.
Endless adventures await on gα?ησν?s?com
Despite not being directly involved, Hurst still found Emerson’s ruthlessness deeply unsettling. The more he thought about it, the less sense it made. Emerson had actually sent people to point a gun at his head and rush him to save Sadie.
Questions tumbled through his mind, none with satisfying answers.
Clearing his throat, Hurst glanced down at his shoes, his voice shaky as he said, “Honestly, I can’t say for certain. Emerson only told me to get you and Mr. Wall out of there unharmed. Emerson said he’d handle Afara and the rest himself.”
A shadow passed over Noah’s face. As he squeezed Sadie’s shoulder, he could feel her slight tremor—barely noticeable but impossible to ignore. Clearly, something was eating at her.
Back when Sadie first crossed paths with Emerson in Zupren, Noah had noticed something strange. The tension between them went far beyond what you’d expect from a confrontation with an enemy. Noah couldn’t shake the sense that a hidden history bound them together.
.
.

###Chapter 1371:
His own chest tightened, a heavy pull settling deep inside him, as if invisible strings were drawing him into her pain.
Letting her endure everything on her own was something he could hardly bear.
Gently, he turned her until she was facing him, concern etched into every feature. “Sadie, can you tell me what really happened between you and Emerson?”
Blaine hovered at the edge of the room, completely lost. Nothing made sense to him.
What were they all talking about?
Emerson’s name alone sent a chill through Blaine. Wasn’t that the Wolfpack’s infamous leader?
How could Sadie be tied up with someone like that?
Noah’s words seemed loaded with meaning. Did Sadie know some life-altering truth that they didn’t?
Everything in the living room seemed to go still, as if the world were holding its breath.
With effort, Sadie lifted her eyes to meet Noah’s.
Not a flicker of accusation or suspicion showed in his gaze, just a gentle, honest wish to help her carry whatever weighed on her.
No point pretending now.
They were already in this together, and keeping Noah in the dark would only build more walls between them.
Strength failed her for a moment, but somehow, she managed to find enough courage to speak up.
“He is my biological father,” Sadie said, her voice barely louder than a whisper.
Utter stillness swept across the room as the revelation hung in the air. Eyes grew wide. Blaine’s jaw nearly hit the floor as he stared at Sadie, then at Noah, his expression flickering between disbelief and pure shock.
Emerson. Her father?
No one could have invented a story as wild as this.
Keep reading g?lnσνs?com
A notorious crime boss, and Sadie was his daughter?
A jolt of understanding passed through Hurst. The pieces finally fit.
Emerson’s strange, unpredictable behavior suddenly made sense.
All along, this had been a twisted family drama.
Compared to what he’d imagined, the situation was a hundred times more complicated.
Rather than study the faces of everyone else, Sadie focused on Noah, searching for any sign of judgment.
She caught the brief surprise in his eyes, though it melted quickly into something far warmer and more protective.
Noah tightened his grip on her shoulder, showing he wouldn’t leave her.
A gentle relief washed over her, easing the ache in her chest. It didn’t last.
Sadie refused to let her guard down, even for a second.
No one knew better than she did just how cold Emerson could be.noveldrama
He’d always chased after power and wealth.
To him, blood ties were nothing more than a bargaining chip.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1372:
A steely look crept into her eyes as she continued.
“Don’t get the wrong idea. He didn’t step in because I’m his daughter.” A harsh, almost mocking smile crossed her lips.
“He only cares about one thing. He doesn’t want my mother’s sacrifices to end up benefiting his enemies. That’s all this is.”
Sadie’s words cast a heavy shadow over the living room once again.
Hurst studied the tense faces around him, weighing his options carefully before sliding a brown envelope from his suit’s inner pocket.
“I discovered this at West Port, moments before Emerson’s men tracked me down.”
The envelope passed from his hands with deliberate ceremony.
All eyes locked onto the mysterious package instantly.
Age had yellowed its edges and softened its corners, though the wax seal held firm against time’s touch.
Sadie’s fingers closed around it, detecting the whisper-thin paper nestled within.
Rather than tear it open, she paused thoughtfully.
Hurst was a shrewd man—he knew exactly when to act and what to do. Presenting this envelope now served twin purposes: deflecting attention from the current tension while proving his continued worth to their cause.
Smart positioning would secure his place beside Noah and Sadie, preventing Emerson from disposing of him when convenience demanded.
Turning the envelope revealed a cryptic sequence of letters and numbers scrawled across its back.
Clearly, a coded message awaited decryption.noveldrama
Her gaze found Blaine, and she pressed the envelope into his hands.
“Find someone reliable to crack this code immediately.”
Blaine’s playful mask slipped away, replaced by grim determination as he accepted the responsibility.
“Don’t worry, Sadie. I’ll take care of it.” He knew how important this could be.

Just then, Breck came in from outside, looking a bit worried.
“Everyone, Mr. Howe has arrived.”
Before the announcement fully settled, a figure burst through the entrance with barely contained urgency. It was Alex.
His suit bore wrinkles from obvious distress, his tie hung at an awkward angle, and his hair fell in disheveled strands across his forehead. Anxiety carved sharp lines.
into his handsome features. “Sadie!” His eyes swept the living room frantically before finding their target.
Relief flooded through Alex the moment he confirmed Sadie’s safety, and his rigid posture crumpled as tension finally released its grip on him.
Without hesitation, he crossed the room and positioned himself protectively in front of Sadie.
Gone was his usual gentle demeanor, replaced by something cold and dangerous.
“Noah Wall!” Barely controlled rage simmered beneath Alex’s strained voice. “How much longer will you keep putting her in harm’s way before you’re satisfied?”
Terror had consumed him completely.
Learning of Sadie’s disappearance had felt like watching his entire world crumble into ash.
Now that she stood before him unharmed, that fear twisted into bitter resentment directed squarely at Noah.
.
.
.
###Chapter 1373:
Without Noah’s influence, Alex was certain Sadie wouldn’t find herself trapped in one dangerous situation after another.
Alex was determined to shield her from this constant source of trouble.
Sadie startled at his sudden protective stance, confusion creasing her brow.
“Alex, what are you doing?” She attempted to step around him, but his arm blocked her path with unwavering determination.
Noah observed the theatrical display with detached calm, his eyes betraying no emotion whatsoever.
Explanations seemed pointless for such childish behavior.
Alex’s dramatic performance struck him as nothing more than an elaborate farce.
Blaine, however, possessed far less patience for the scene.
Watching Alex parade his devotion while casting blame on Noah made his stomach turn.
“Mr. Howe, why put on such a show?”
Blaine folded his arms across his chest, his tone dripping with mockery. “Do you have the courage to tell Sadie about all the things you’ve been doing behind her back?”
Alex’s frame went rigid for just a heartbeat before he recovered his composure.
Not a flicker of guilt crossed his features.
Instead, he turned toward Sadie with tender eyes, his voice softening considerably. “My feelings for Sadie have always been transparent.” When he faced Blaine again, steel had replaced the gentleness in his gaze. “Mr. Castro, you’re free to act as you wish, but I suggest you choose your words more carefully. Making baseless accusations without proof could easily be considered slander, don’t you think?”
Blaine’s control snapped like a wire stretched too tight.
“Slander you?” His hands balled into fists while his chest rose and fell with barely contained fury.
Images of Tina’s lifeless form and countless shadowy transactions burned behind his eyes.
How could Alex stand there wearing that mask of perfect devotion so effortlessly?
