**********

"Nala, you can't eat that."

When the medicine bowl was knocked over, my cat Nala suddenly jumped down from the windowsill and started licking the spilled medicine on the floor.

I wanted to stop her, but I was too weak and dizzy to move.

I scolded her twice, but Nala ignored me, so I had to give up.

The medicine was something my husband had gone to great lengths to find to help nourish my body. Although human medicine is different from cat medicine, a little bit shouldn't harm her.

I struggled to pick up the bowl and put it back on the nightstand, then collapsed onto the pillow, panting.

Nala licked the floor clean and then jumped back onto the windowsill, basking in the sun and washing her face with her paws.

I looked longingly at the sunlight streaming through the glass window, imagining how warm it must be.

Since my health had deteriorated to the point where even standing up was difficult, I hadn't been out in the sun for a long time.

Thinking about my health made me feel a bit down.

Ever since I gave birth to a pair of adorable boy-girl twins, my health had been getting worse.

At first, I was just dizzy, but then I became lethargic and weak, losing hair in clumps, and my spirits were getting worse.

Now, I barely had the strength to get out of bed.

Fortunately, I have a loving and caring husband, Brandon Jordan. After I frequently felt dizzy post-childbirth, he worried about my health and persuaded me to take a break from work and rest at home.

He even gave up his beloved screenwriting career to help manage the company my parents left behind.

People who know us say I'm incredibly lucky to have such a good husband like Brandon.

I also feel that way. With a loving husband like Brandon and three adorable and considerate children, I am what people often call a winner in life!

It's just that my body is failing me, suddenly deteriorating. Even after visiting major hospitals, no one could find anything wrong.

Brandon has been running around trying to find ways to treat me.

He even hired a nanny to take care of me, prepare my medicine, and remind me to take it on time, hoping I would get better soon.

I also want to get better soon, but...

"Knock, knock, knock!"

As I was lost in thought, the nanny knocked and entered, "Mrs. Jordan, did you take your medicine?"

The nanny Brandon found is named Shirley Ross, and she's only twenty-five years old.

Shirley is very pretty, and although young, she's honest and diligent, taking great care of me.

I'm very satisfied with her and have praised her to Brandon multiple times, even asking him to give her two raises.

I glanced at Nala washing her face on the windowsill and didn't mention that the medicine had spilled and Nala had licked it up.

I just nodded weakly, "Yes, I took it."

I've been taking this medicine since I started feeling dizzy three years ago, but it hasn't helped, and my health has only gotten worse.

Honestly, it's good that it spilled!

I didn't want to take it anymore.

Shirley smiled with relief, "It's good that you took it. Mr. Jordan insisted that you take your medicine on time every day." As she quickly cleaned up the medicine bowl, she sighed with envy, "I've been a nanny for a long time, and Mr. Jordan is the best husband I've ever seen. Mrs. Jordan, you are truly blessed!"

I know I'm blessed.

If only I could have a healthy body again!

I sighed inwardly and looked at the bright sunlight outside, "Shirley, I want to go out and get some sun."

"Okay, Mrs. Jordan." Shirley smiled, "I'll take you out once I finish cleaning up."

"Alright."

Shirley left, and the room became quiet again. For some reason, the silence made me uneasy.

Suddenly,

"Meow!"

A sharp cat's cry startled me. I turned my head to see Nala falling from the windowsill and twitching on the carpet before going still.

If it weren't for her breathing, I would have thought she was dead.

But how could Nala fall from the windowsill?

Cats have great balance, and Nala has always been healthy. Even if she fell, she shouldn't have been knocked out.

She was a gift for my first child, and I've always taken good care of her. There's no way she could have eaten something wrong or suddenly gotten sick.

The only thing she ate that she shouldn't have was...

I suddenly turned my head, staring at the faint medicine stain on the floor.

A chill ran down my spine.

I hurriedly and weakly got out of bed, my legs trembling. I took one step and fell to the floor.

I didn't dare cry out in pain, and I didn't know why, but I was afraid of alerting anyone.

I struggled to crawl to Nala, carefully cradling her soft body.

She seemed to be asleep, but how deeply must she be sleeping to not wake up no matter how I moved her?

Looking at her unconscious state, I couldn't help but imagine if I was the same after taking the medicine.

Unaware and at the mercy of others!

But how could that be?

This medicine was prescribed by a famous expert Brandon found after traveling thousands of miles.

He loves me so much; how could he harm me?

But if not him, then who?

I felt like I was falling into an icy abyss, shivering with cold.

Just then, I heard footsteps outside the door.

I quickly crawled back to bed with Nala, pretending to be asleep.

The footsteps stopped at the door, and I heard someone turning the doorknob. I tensed up, trembling slightly.

The door opened, and the person seemed to just glance inside before closing the door again.

Then I heard faint voices in the hallway, "She must keep taking the medicine. Make sure she takes it."

The voices faded, and I couldn't hear anything else.

I opened my eyes and stared at the pale ceiling, feeling like I had been pulled out of icy water.

Fear made me tremble uncontrollably. What did Brandon mean by that?

Is he really trying to harm me?

Our family is well-off. I'm an only child, and my parents ran a construction company. When the real estate industry boomed, their company grew significantly.

But shortly after Brandon and I got married, my parents died in a car accident, and I inherited their company.

When my health declined, I handed over the company's management to Brandon and focused on resting at home.

If he wanted to harm me, it would make sense.

After all, if I died, Brandon, as my husband, would legally inherit all my assets.

But could it really be him?

We've been in love for five years and married for three.

In eight years, he's always treated me the same.

He surprises me on holidays and anniversaries, and if he's busy with work and neglects me, he buys me gifts to make up for it.

I'm not good at cooking, so he takes care of all the household chores, cooking, and taking care of the kids without complaint.

When I got sick, he was more worried than anyone.

He took me to major hospitals for checkups and read various books to find ways to cure me.

Whenever he heard about a famous doctor, he would book a flight and take me to see them.

Even my friends say Brandon treats me like a daughter.

Sometimes, he even prioritizes me over our daughter.

He says our daughter will grow up and leave home, eventually getting married.

But I am the only one who will walk with him through life.

No one can replace me in his heart!

Could someone who loves me so deeply really harm me?

If someone wanted to harm another, could they really treat them like a treasure for ten years?

I don't believe it.

Because if it's true, then he's truly terrifying!

But if it's not him, then who?

Besides Brandon and the kids, there's only the nanny, Shirley.

But Shirley is honest and has no reason to harm me.

Other families might worry about a young, pretty nanny getting involved with the husband.

But Shirley knows her boundaries and rarely appears when Brandon is home.

And when Brandon is home, he's always with me, so they have no time to be alone.

Brandon can't be the one, and Shirley has no motive. So who could be trying to harm me?

###chapter 2

After my father passed away due to illness, I devoted most of my energy to the company to stabilize the business, even neglecting Brandon to some extent.

During that time, I had very little contact with outsiders, mostly interacting with people from the company.

Later, when I got pregnant, Brandon felt sorry for me and advised me to rest while he took over running the company. After that, I focused solely on the family and had even less contact with people, mostly interacting with Brandon, Shirley, and our three children.

The children were all born through my hard work, and the oldest was only eight years old, while the two younger ones were just four or five.

How could a few young children know what it means to harm someone?

After much thought, only Brandon and Shirley seemed the most suspicious!

But could it really be them?

A chill ran up my spine, making me afraid to think further.

Because I realized that if Brandon was the one harming me, Shirley, who always took care of me, would surely know that I would fall into a deep sleep every time I took the medicine.

If it was Shirley, then as my husband, how could Brandon not notice anything unusual?

Most importantly, I suddenly realized that after taking this medicine for so many years, there had been no improvement at all.

Given Brandon's concern for me, how could he not be anxious to change my medication and find a new doctor, but instead insist that I continue taking this medicine?

This realization terrified me, making me feel as if I had sunk into an abyss.

Endless fear and despair wrapped around me like vines, making it difficult to breathe.

Time passed slowly, and the entire room was as quiet as a tomb.

Only the soft body of Nala in my arms provided a bit of warmth.

Yet, this bit of warmth was the very source of my current state.

I felt torn between two extremes, unsure if it was because I hadn't taken the medicine or if my nerves were too tense, but I was in a state of fearful excitement, unable to sleep at all.

I lay there with my eyes open, watching the sunlight gradually disappear and the night slowly engulf the light.

Until my stomach growled, I suddenly realized that no one had come to check on me for such a long time.

Usually, Brandon would show concern for my well-being as soon as he got home, but he hadn't even shown his face.

And Shirley, who usually took great care of me, hadn't even asked what I wanted to eat.

Moreover, she had promised to take me out to get some sun after finishing her tasks. Had she forgotten, or did they always know that I would fall into a deep, unconscious sleep after taking the medicine, so there was no need to bother?

I didn't dare to think deeply, my heart felt wrapped in ice, cold and painful.

The night magnified all emotions, and I held Nala tightly, shivering until dawn.

After dawn, Nala suddenly let out a soft meow and opened her eyes.

At first, her gaze was a bit unfocused. Even though she had slept for almost a whole day and night, she still seemed lethargic, lazily shifting to a more comfortable sleeping position and closing her eyes to continue sleeping.

This state was very similar to how I felt after waking up.

I also felt more exhausted after waking up, my brain sluggish like an old, broken machine.

My suspicions grew stronger, and I held Nala tightly in fear.

Perhaps I was holding her too tightly, as Nala meowed several times in discomfort, her round eyes staring at me as if worried.

Looking into her clear eyes, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness, hugging her tightly as silent tears fell.

"Nala, who do you think is trying to harm me?"

I, Caroline Sharp, have never wronged anyone, whether it be Brandon or Shirley.

Back when Brandon's parents were seriously ill, and he had no income for a long time, I paid for all the medical expenses.

At that time, he held me guiltily and promised in my ear, "Caroline, you saved my parents, which is like saving my life. You are a benefactor to the Jordan family. I, Brandon, will treat you well and be devoted to you for life. If I fail to do so, may I be punished by God!"

Over the years, he had indeed treated me well, as he promised.

He always went along with me and never argued. Whenever I was upset about work or other matters, he would go out of his way to cheer me up.

Even my friends said I was lucky to have married such a good man like Brandon!

Previously, I had always thought so too. But now, I couldn't help but question him.

Does he really love me as much as he shows?

Is his relationship with Shirley as clean as they appear?

Once doubt takes root, it grows and flourishes, becoming more pervasive over time.

Now that the enemy is hidden and I am in the open, to uncover the person harming me, I can only continue to pretend and observe in secret to find out who it is.

Having made up my mind, I glanced at the clock on the bedside table, thinking about the time Shirley usually brought me my medicine, and instinctively held Nala tighter.

I must find out who is drugging me and their motive!

Calculating the time, I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep.

Sure enough, the next second, I heard footsteps at the door.

Then, Shirley knocked on the door and called out, "Mrs. Jordan."

I didn't respond, only tightening my grip on Nala under the covers.

Soon, Shirley opened the door and walked in, glancing at me still asleep on the bed, and let out a cold snort.

"Tsk, fool, still sleeping!"

Her voice was full of disdain and disgust, completely different from the respectful and gentle tone she usually used with me.

My nails dug into my palms as I struggled to remain silent, my heart in turmoil.

I had always treated Shirley well. Although she was hired by Brandon, she spent more time with me, and because she was diligent, clean, and attentive, taking care of me meticulously, I couldn't go out and gradually became close to her, treating her like a friend.

Whenever I had something good, I would think of sharing it with her. Knowing her family was not well-off, I would find various excuses to give her money, wanting to help her more.

But the Shirley I treated as a friend turned out to be like this behind my back, even calling me a fool!

Thinking carefully, if it weren't for Nala accidentally taking my medicine, I wouldn't have discovered the problem and realized that I was surrounded by ill-intentioned people.

With a light "thud," I knew Shirley had placed the medicine bowl on the bedside table.

She usually did that, then woke me up to take the medicine.

Sure enough, the next second, I felt a hand on my shoulder.

Then Shirley's voice, completely different from the disdainful one earlier, gentle and respectful, "Mrs. Jordan, wake up, it's time to take your medicine."

After she nudged me the third time, I pretended to wake up, "groggily" turning to her, "Shirley, is it morning already?"

I mimicked my usual soft, weak voice, trying to sit up but lacking the strength.

Seeing this, Shirley didn't suspect anything, quickly reaching out to help me, "Yes, Mrs. Jordan, you slept well through the night. You look better than yesterday."

I followed her strength to sit up, leaning against the headboard.

Shirley quickly and thoughtfully brought two pillows to support my back, making me more comfortable.

I looked at her and tentatively said, "Why do I feel even weaker than yesterday?"

Shirley showed no reaction on her face, but her lowered eyelashes trembled slightly with excitement.

The movement was subtle, and if I hadn't been paying attention, I wouldn't have noticed.

"Mrs. Jordan, don't overthink it," Shirley gently comforted, opening the curtains and windows, "You look much better than yesterday. I'll open the window to let in some fresh air. The weather is nice today. Didn't you say you wanted to get some sun yesterday? After you take your medicine, I'll take you for a walk in the garden."

If I hadn't been suspicious and noticed her emotional reaction earlier, I would have doubted myself, thinking I was overthinking things based on her current behavior.

###chapter 3

I leaned against the headboard, weakly nodding, "Just leave it there, I'll drink it later. I'm feeling dizzy right now."

At this point, I definitely wasn't going to continue taking the medicine. I could only wait until Shirley left to pour it out.

But just then, the door to the room was pushed open by Brandon. He looked sharp and fresh in his suit.

"Caroline, have you taken your medicine?"

I almost forgot, every morning before Brandon goes to work, he comes to my room to talk to me.

Before I could speak, Shirley answered quickly, "Not yet, Mrs. Jordan said she's feeling dizzy."

As soon as she said that, I clearly saw the two of them exchange a subtle glance, as if they were sharing some information.

They definitely have a conspiracy!

Brandon gave me a reproachful look, "Caroline, you must take your medicine on time, otherwise, when will you get better? Hmm?"

His voice was gentle, showing great patience towards me.

"I'll feed you."

With that, he picked up the bowl of medicine, scooped a spoonful, and brought it to my lips.

I gently pushed his hand away, pretending to be embarrassed, "Shirley is still here, what are you doing?"

"Brandon, you should go to work first, I'll drink it myself later."

Brandon let out a light laugh, "Shirley is family, don't worry about her seeing."

"Besides, Caroline, if you don't take your medicine, how can I focus on work today? Drink it quickly, don't make me worry."

My hand under the blanket clenched tightly.

I never thought Brandon was so insistent on me taking my medicine.

But now that I think about it, every morning before he goes to work, he watches me take my medicine.

The reason behind this is terrifying to think about.

I forced a smile, thinking about how to avoid taking the medicine today.

Just then, Brandon's phone rang. I quickly took the bowl of medicine, "Brandon, you should answer the call, I'll drink it myself."

Seeing this, he smiled and nodded, walking over to the window.

While he was on the phone, I said to Shirley, "Go get me a piece of sugar, my mouth is bitter after taking the medicine."

Shirley showed a strange expression, "Mrs. Jordan, you never used to..."

"Can't I want to eat it now? Do I need to say it a second time?"

I couldn't help but frown and speak forcefully.

Only then did Shirley leave the room to get me the sugar.

Taking advantage of this moment, I poured the entire bowl of medicine under the bed.

Just then, Brandon finished his call and turned around.

My heart was racing, afraid he would notice something.

Fortunately, Brandon didn't notice anything. He sat by the bed, gently stroking my cheek with the back of his hand.

"That was a call from the company. Caroline, get better soon, so I don't have to manage the company for you."

His hand was warm on my cheek.

But I couldn't stop trembling.

Is this the hand of a lover, or a murderer?

He leaned forward and kissed my forehead.

At the same time, Shirley returned with the sugar, her face darkening with jealousy at the sight.

I put the sugar Shirley brought into my mouth and lay down as usual.

After Brandon tucked me in, he left the room.

Usually, I would have fallen asleep by now, so they would definitely let their guard down.

So I quickly got up and walked to the window, staring at the spot below.

But I saw nothing unusual. Brandon took the coat and briefcase from Shirley and got into the car as usual.

Maybe I was wrong?

Could it be that Brandon doesn't know about Shirley's plan and has been deceived by her too?

But ever since Shirley came to our house, I treated her like family. Why would she do this to me?

Thinking of the chilling look she gave me earlier, a sudden realization hit me.

Could it be that Shirley has fallen for Brandon and is using these means against me?

The more I thought about it, the more terrifying it seemed. I wanted to tell Brandon about this immediately.

But since I got sick, I hardly used my phone and spent all day sleeping in this room.

If I went out to find Brandon rashly, Shirley would find out.

I could only lie in bed, staring at the dark ceiling, enduring it.

But I hadn't slept well last night, and soon I couldn't resist the heavy sleepiness and fell asleep.

When I woke up, it was already evening, and a sliver of sunset light was pouring in through the heavy curtains.

Just then, the door opened, and I quickly closed my eyes, pretending to be asleep.

At this time, it was usually Shirley coming to give me my medicine.

But she always woke me up, and I never knew what she did while I was asleep.

I felt someone slowly approaching me, as if I was being stared at by a pair of venomous eyes.

The next second, Shirley spoke, "Why aren't you dead yet? If you die, Brandon will be mine."

"Why do you have everything since you were born, being excellent in every way? Why do all the good things fall to you? Why is Brandon yours?"

"Go die, just die!"

Shirley's voice was like a demon's, making me shiver.

I gritted my teeth, enduring it. Just then, I felt a sharp pain on my face.

I realized she had pricked me with something. Afraid she would do more, I pretended to wake up.

"Ugh, Shirley, what time is it?"

"It's four in the afternoon, Mrs. Jordan."

I opened my eyes, and Shirley's face was as calm as ever, as if the crazy woman just now wasn't her.

She handed me the bowl of medicine, "Mrs. Jordan, it's time to take your medicine."

I was about to use the excuse from the morning, but she handed me the sugar with her other hand, "Mrs. Jordan, the sugar is ready."

I knew she wouldn't leave until she saw me finish the medicine today. I could only force myself to drink it and pretend to lie down quietly.

"You can go now, I want to sleep a bit more."

After Shirley left, I quickly got up and ran to the bathroom, forcing myself to vomit out all the medicine.

Just then, I heard the sound of a car horn.

I quickly walked to the window, and sure enough, Brandon was back.

I was about to tell him everything that happened today when I saw Brandon get out of the car and pinch Shirley's butt.

Shirley immediately blushed and hid in Brandon's arms.

I was struck by lightning, unable to believe what I was seeing.

It was really him, the Brandon who had been with me for eight years, treating me like a treasure, wanted to harm me.

From the moment I discovered the medicine was problematic, I never wanted or dared to suspect Brandon.

Because I couldn't believe our years of affection were fake.

But now, the scene downstairs hit me hard.

It turns out deep affection can be acted out.

My face turned as white as a sheet, and I pulled the curtains tightly to keep myself from collapsing.

I only came to my senses when I heard footsteps coming upstairs, struggling to get back to bed.

I heard the footsteps stop at my door.

Brandon asked, "Did she take her medicine today?"

Shirley laughed lightly, "Of course she did. That stupid woman Caroline thought it was life-saving medicine and drank it all in one go."

###chapter 4

I couldn't stop trembling under the covers.

All the blood in my body started to turn cold.

So, it turns out, all of this is actually true.

It really is Brandon who wants to harm me.

And I was completely unaware, foolishly deceived by them for so long!

Could it be that during these years of my illness, I've been taking the poison they've been giving me?

Just thinking about it makes me want to vomit, but my stomach is empty and I can't throw up anything.

Why? Why do these two want to harm me?

Tears slowly rolled down my cheeks, and just then I suddenly heard a child's cry.

It's my child, yes, my children are still in their hands, I can't cry now!

Although I don't know what their purpose is in harming me, I must stay strong for the sake of my children!

I got up and pressed the bedside bell.

Moments later, Shirley walked in, looking a bit surprised to see that I was still awake.

She seemed surprised that I wasn't asleep yet.

She looked at me warily and asked, "Mrs. Jordan, why aren't you asleep? Did you hear something?"

I knew she was referring to the flirting sounds she and Brandon made at the door just now.

But I pretended not to know: "I just have a headache and can't sleep. Was there any noise just now?"

Shirley stared at my face for a long time, and seeing that I didn't show any other expression, she relaxed.

"No, it was just Aria crying a bit. I was afraid she would wake you."

Aria Jordan is my youngest child and the second of the boy-girl twins.

But ever since I gave birth, my health has rapidly declined, and now, because of Brandon and Shirley's harm, I lie in this room all day, with no time to see them.

When I'm awake, I ask to see the children, but Shirley always finds various excuses to brush me off.

Excuses like the children will disturb my rest, or the children are already asleep.

Usually, only my eldest son, Brett Jordan, comes to see me, but recently, because he started boarding school, I can only see him once a week.

But now that I think about it, I find it terrifying.

Brett was doing fine at the nearby school, but Brandon suddenly suggested sending him to boarding school.

He claimed it was to train Brett, but who knows if it's because Brett has grown up and can discern some things, and Brandon is worried he might notice something?

Poor Brett, at an age when he should be enjoying the love of his parents, is forced to grow up and sent to boarding school, only able to see me once a week.

Thinking of this, my face turned cold.

These two people, I will never let them go.

No matter what they want to take from me, whether it's the company or the children, I will take it back!

I nodded, "I can't sleep either. I'll go see the children."

Shirley was taken aback, "Mrs. Jordan, you're weak, be careful not to catch a cold."

Another excuse, every time I want to see the children, she always finds an excuse.

I frowned, "It's just a few steps, how can I catch a cold? Can't I see my own children?"

Seeing that I was speaking firmly, Shirley quickly nodded, "Then I'll accompany you."

I held onto Shirley's arm and walked step by step to the children's room.

Since I gave birth to them, I rarely come to this room to see them.

I saw the two children lying in their cribs, sucking their fingers as they slept.

They seemed unaware of what was happening in this house.

I looked at the two children, gently stroking the hair on their foreheads.

Two poor children, never having tasted a drop of my milk since birth, it's all my fault!

Seeing me cry, Shirley quickly asked, "Mrs. Jordan, what's wrong?"

I gently shook my head, "It's nothing, I just feel sorry for them, not being able to take care of them since they were little."

Shirley then relaxed and said, "It's okay, the children will understand you when they grow up."

I reached out and picked up Aria. She was born later and was much smaller than her brother.

But as soon as I picked her up, Aria started crying in my arms.

She opened her eyes and reached out to Shirley, "Mommy, hold me!"

Shirley looked at me guiltily and explained, "Aria has been taken care of by me since she was little, so she might be a bit confused. Mrs. Jordan, please don't mind."

My heart was already cold. Aria saying this was no coincidence; someone must have taught her something in private.

I shook my head, "Of course I don't mind, but the children not recognizing their biological mother is not acceptable. I'll make time to take care of them from now on."

Shirley flatly refused, "How can that be? You're not well, taking care of children is very tiring."

Just then, I heard footsteps at the door.

Brandon walked in and was surprised to see me, "Caroline? You're not resting?"

They seemed to have assumed I would be asleep at this time, so they were very surprised to see me.

"I have a headache and can't sleep, so I wanted to see the children."

Brandon put his arm around my shoulder and said gently, "Let Shirley take care of the children. Your job now is to get better, understand?"

Hearing him say these sweet words again, my heart was filled with coldness and numbness.

I used to think Brandon said these things sincerely, but now I understand that sincerity can change in an instant.

Maybe there was a moment when he was sincere, but now it's definitely fake.

I nodded. Since he can act with me, I will act with him.

I reached out and straightened Brandon's tie, "Since I'm up, I'll join you for dinner. It's been a long time since we had dinner together."

As soon as I said this, Brandon and Shirley's faces froze, then they smiled and nodded.

"Sure, I'm happy to have you join me for dinner."

Brandon held me as we went downstairs. I saw that the table was set for two, and the dishes didn't look like they were for one person.

Brandon and Shirley didn't know I was coming down for dinner, so it was obvious who the two places were set for.

I sat in one of the seats, and Brandon sat next to me.

He called Shirley over, "Since Caroline is joining us, you should eat with us too."

It was as if he was deliberately emphasizing something in front of me.

Shirley looked at me and hesitated, "But Mr. Jordan, Mrs. Jordan, it's rare for you to have dinner together, I don't want to intrude. I'll eat in the kitchen."

I looked up at her. Despite her words, her eyes were full of desire to stay and eat with us.

Just as Brandon was about to insist, I spoke up, "Since Shirley is being considerate, let's not disappoint her."

###chapter 5

As soon as these words were spoken, Brandon couldn't persuade Shirley to stay any longer.

Shirley gave me a jealous glare and, as she passed Brandon, she ran her finger down his back, making her intentions clear.

Brandon glanced at me warily, as if checking to see if I had noticed their covert interaction.

I calmly continued eating, pretending not to see anything.

After all, the most important thing for me right now is to take care of my health. After years of medication, my body is severely depleted.

Only by restoring my health will I have the strength to fight these two to the end.

After finishing my meal, I felt a wave of drowsiness.

Brandon looked at me and asked gently, "Are you sleepy?"

I nodded. I hadn't rested well today, so it was normal to feel sleepy now.

He smiled helplessly, "You get sleepy right after eating. I'll carry you to the room."

In the past, I never thought there was anything wrong with this, only that it was sweet.

But now, I was wary of every word he said.

"No need, I'll stay with you until you finish eating. It's rare for us to have a meal together."

I was afraid they would force-feed me medicine once I went back, so I quickly said.

Brandon nodded, "Alright then, I'll eat quickly so you don't have to wait long."

His display of tenderness made me feel as if everything that happened today was just a dream.

When the dream ends, I still have Brandon who loves me deeply, and none of this ever happened.

After finishing his meal, Brandon bent down and carried me back to the room.

"You've lost so much weight. You need to eat more and take better care of your health."

I couldn't tell if he was being sincere or not, so I just nodded.

Back in the dimly lit room, Brandon laid me on the bed and carefully tucked me in.

I was really drowsy until I suddenly jolted awake, realizing that Brandon was still standing by my bed.

He was watching me!

This realization sent chills down my spine, making it impossible to sleep. I pretended to breathe evenly as if I were asleep.

A few minutes later, Brandon gently patted my shoulder, "Caroline, are you asleep?"

He hadn't left; he was still standing by the bed watching me.

At that moment, the door opened, and Shirley walked in.

"Is she asleep?"

Brandon responded, "I've been watching her for a while. She's sound asleep."

I continued to pretend to be asleep while straining to hear their conversation.

"Starting tomorrow, increase the dosage. The fact that she could get up today means she's developed a resistance to the medication. We need to increase the dosage."

I felt terrified. Brandon was such a good actor. Even though I knew his true nature, his performance still startled me.

After they left, the room was silent, leaving me alone in bed.

I wanted to cry, but I didn't. I knew it wasn't the time to cry.

In my current state, I was practically imprisoned by them. The urgent task was to find a way to contact the outside world so I wouldn't be completely isolated.

But Shirley was home all day, and Brandon came back every day. Even if I wanted to contact the outside world, there was no way.

Thinking about this, I fell asleep that night.

The next morning, I surprisingly found that I had regained some strength.

After all, I had stopped taking the medication for two days and had eaten, so this method seemed to be working for now.

As usual, Shirley brought me my medication.

Seeing that I was awake, she was surprised, "Mrs. Jordan, you're up so early?"

I nodded, "I went to bed early last night. I don't know why, but I've been feeling increasingly dizzy these past two days. Did you reduce my medication?"

I said this on purpose to prevent Shirley and Brandon from suspecting my current state.

Sure enough, Shirley nodded and said, "Maybe it's because you've been taking this medication for too long. I'll ask Mr. Jordan to consult the doctor and get you some different medication."

I didn't say anything and took the bowl of medicine.

The bitterness was stronger than usual, indicating they had indeed increased the dosage.

I frowned and drank it down. Shirley looked satisfied as I finished the medicine.

After she left, I went to the bathroom to vomit it out, as I had done before.

After vomiting, I pressed the bell to ask Shirley to prepare breakfast for me.

Shirley was a bit surprised, but knowing that I had developed a resistance to the medication, she didn't find it too strange.

After breakfast, I took a nap to conserve my energy.

The most important thing now was to wait for an opportunity to contact the outside world.

If I remained in my previous state, I wouldn't be able to escape even if I had the chance.

In my sleep, I felt hands touching my face.

Startled, I quickly opened my eyes.

It was Brett sitting by my bed, looking at me with wide, worried eyes.

Seeing me awake, he exclaimed, "Mom, you're awake?"

Seeing it was Brett, I felt relieved, "Is today Friday?"

Brett nodded, "Yes, Mom. I have a day off today and can stay with you all day tomorrow!"

I suddenly realized this was the opportunity I had been waiting for!

I nodded and glanced at the door.

"Has Brandon or Shirley ever acted strangely?"

Brett shook his head, "No, but Shirley doesn't seem to like me. She only likes my younger siblings. She doesn't talk to me when I come home."

I was taken aback, remembering Aria calling her mom.

It seemed Shirley had already considered my children as her own.

Brett, being older and more independent, naturally wasn't liked by her.

I was furious, but I didn't show it, "Did you tell Dad?"

Brett nodded, then shook his head dejectedly, "I did, but Dad said I was overthinking it. He said Shirley is too busy to take care of me and that I should handle my own affairs."

Hearing this, I couldn't contain my anger.

Brett was only eight years old. What could he handle on his own?

Brandon, that bastard, was neglecting Brett to cover up his affair with Shirley!

I nodded and said, "Brett, can you do something for Mom?"

He nodded eagerly, his eyes bright.

"Mom, tell me. I can do it!"

I finally spoke, "Mom doesn't have a phone right now. Can you find it for me?"

Since I got sick, I had moved out of the master bedroom into a separate room.

My phone was in the nightstand in the master bedroom. It would be suspicious if I went to get it, but not if Brett did.

###chapter 6

Brett nodded and happily ran out.

Moments later, he came back and shook his head at me.

"I couldn't find Mom's phone, there was only Shirley's phone."

I was taken aback, "Shirley's phone is in my nightstand?"

Brett nodded.

A wave of nausea surged in my heart. It seemed these two had already moved in together, and Shirley had even considered herself the mistress of this house.

I sneered inwardly, thinking, "Do you even deserve it?"

I kept my expression neutral and continued talking to Brett, "Then go to Dad's study and see if you can find it there. If anyone finds out, remember, this is our little secret, and you can't tell anyone, okay?"

Kids naturally have an interest in such tasks, and as soon as Brett heard this, he immediately hopped away.

Unfortunately, after a while, he came back empty-handed, "All the drawers in Dad's room are locked, I couldn't find it."

It seemed Brandon had hidden my phone to prevent me from contacting the outside world.

I patted Brett's head, "It's okay if you can't find it. Just remember, this is our secret, and you can't tell anyone."

Brett nodded solemnly and left my room.

But I was left staring into the dark room, feeling lost. Where could Brandon have hidden my phone? Could it be in the study? It seemed I needed to find an opportunity to check.

Soon, fate favored me again; the power went out that night.

Brett came over to tell me he was going out to dinner with Brandon and Shirley, and I nodded without saying a word.

But inside, I was thrilled; the opportunity had come.

After they left, the house fell into complete silence, and it was pitch dark everywhere.

I got up and went to the study upstairs, turning the doorknob.

The study was quiet, but my heart was pounding like a drum. Even though I knew no one was home, I was still terrified.

The glass cabinet in the study reflected the moonlight from outside, displaying some of the company's achievements over the years.

I glanced over them and focused on Brandon's desk.

I reached out to open the drawer, but as Brett had said, it was locked. Brandon was extremely cautious and would never leave the key in an easily found place.

Sure enough, I searched around and found nothing.

Standing in the study, I carefully thought about where Brandon might hide the key.

From what I knew of him, he trusted no one but himself, meaning he would carry the key with him.

But since he wasn't home, I was out of ideas.

Suddenly, I thought of something.

Brandon was very clear about separating work and life. For instance, when going out for dinner like tonight, he wouldn't bring his briefcase or answer work calls.

The key was likely in his briefcase.

Excited, I went downstairs to the entryway and found Brandon's briefcase.

Sure enough, a bunch of silver keys was inside.

I grabbed the keys and rushed upstairs, opening each drawer of the desk. In one of them, I found my phone.

I eagerly pressed the power button, but the phone didn't respond.

This wasn't surprising, as I hadn't used it for over a year, and it was likely out of battery.

But with the power out, I had no way to charge it.

The phone was just a useless piece of metal to me now.

As I was worrying, the lights in the study suddenly came on.

My heart skipped a beat, thinking Brandon had returned.

But when I heard no movement in the house, I realized the power was back.

Great, even God was helping me!

I excitedly found a charger and plugged in the phone. Soon, the screen lit up.

I entered the password from memory, but it didn't work.

I realized that Brandon, the bastard, had changed my password.

I tried several times, but none worked, and the phone was locked for thirty seconds.

If this continued, I would waste this rare opportunity. I took a deep breath and thought about what password Brandon might use.

After thirty seconds, I impulsively entered Shirley's birthday, and the phone unlocked.

I was filled with rage. It was bad enough that Brandon and Shirley were having an affair, but to set my phone's password to Shirley's birthday was a blatant disregard for me.

But now wasn't the time to dwell on that. I quickly called my best friend, Kathy Patel.

At this point, she was the only one I could trust.

The call connected quickly, and Kathy's voice was as lazy as ever.

"Hello? Brandon? How's our Caroline doing?"

It seemed Brandon had used my phone to call Kathy often, or she wouldn't have reacted this way.

I spoke, "Kathy, it's me!"

Kathy was stunned, "Caroline? How are you? I've been wanting to visit you this past year, but Brandon wouldn't let me. It made me so mad. You have to help me deal with him!"

Hearing Kathy's voice, tears welled up in my eyes.

"Kathy, we've all been deceived by Brandon."

I told her everything I had discovered.

Kathy was furious, "Unbelievable! Brandon and Shirley did this? And I was fooled for over a year!"

"Wait, I'm coming to get you right now."

I quickly calmed Kathy down, saying, "Kathy, not yet. The kids are still with them. I could escape easily, but I need to get my kids and the company back!"

I asked Kathy to find a way to get me a communication phone so we could stay in touch. I couldn't talk to her for too long on this phone, or Brandon might get suspicious.

After hanging up, I deleted the call record and felt a sense of relief. With Kathy's help, I felt more at ease.

I lay back in bed but suddenly realized I hadn't put the keys back in Brandon's bag.

I got up and quickly put the keys back. Just as I was about to go upstairs, the door opened.

I heard Brett's voice, "Oh, the power's back!"

I knew there was no way I could get back to my room in time, so I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water.

When I came out, I ran into Brandon and Shirley.

They were surprised to see me.

"Caroline? What are you doing here?"

I raised the glass, "Where did you guys go? I was so thirsty I had to come down for water."

###chapter 7

Brandon gave me a suspicious look and went to check his briefcase.

I watched him nervously, afraid he might notice something.

Fortunately, Brandon didn't notice anything. He turned back with that familiar gentle expression.

"Sorry, Caroline. The power went out at home, so I took them out to eat. I thought you'd still be asleep when we got back."

I waved my hand. "It's fine. I do need to go back to sleep. I'm feeling really dizzy."

Shirley quickly came over to support me and helped me into the bedroom.

I lay down quietly, and after Shirley left, I couldn't help but feel excited.

I actually succeeded in contacting Kathy. Now I just have to wait for her to get back to me!

For the next few days, I took my medication and slept as usual. Neither Shirley nor Brandon suspected anything.

Until one afternoon, Kathy suddenly showed up.

I heard her voice from my room, feeling excited but unable to make any moves.

After all, I was supposed to be sleeping in my room.

The voices from downstairs faintly reached my room.

I only heard Kathy saying she wanted to check on my recovery, while Shirley kept blocking her.

"What's wrong with you? You're just a nanny. I'm here to see your mistress. Who are you to stop me?"

That's Kathy for you, still as feisty as ever.

Sure enough, Shirley was left speechless and said, "Mrs. Jordan isn't feeling well. Let me ask Mr. Jordan if you can see her."

Then Shirley called Brandon.

I don't know what he said to her, but Brandon actually agreed to let Kathy come up to see me.

Then I heard footsteps, and my bedroom door was pushed open.

As soon as Kathy came in, she frowned. "Why are the curtains drawn in broad daylight? This room smells like medicine. You're going to suffocate Caroline!"

Saying that, she stepped forward and pulled open the heavy curtains.

Shirley immediately stopped her. "What are you doing? Mrs. Jordan is resting!"

Kathy ignored her and sat by my bed.

"Caroline, how are you? I came to see you."

I pretended to be woken up and opened my eyes.

"Kathy, why are you here?"

She exchanged a look with me and said, "I haven't seen you in a year. I was worried about your recovery, so I came to check on you."

I glanced at Kathy, then at Shirley, who was watching us closely, and said, "Don't worry. Brandon treats me well. He's just worried about my condition getting worse, so he's been strict. Don't blame him."

Kathy nodded and said she understood.

Then she turned to Shirley. "Can you leave us alone for a bit? I want to chat with Caroline."

"You!"

Shirley glared, about to get angry, but then she realized I was there and said, "Mr. Jordan doesn't want me to leave Mrs. Jordan's sight. In case anything happens, I can help immediately."

So, we couldn't send Shirley away. We had to chat while exchanging glances.

As we chatted, Kathy suddenly stood up. "By the way, where are your boy-girl twins? I only saw them when they were born and haven't seen them since."

I immediately understood her meaning and said to Shirley, "Take Kathy to see the kids. I'm not feeling well, so I won't go down."

Shirley seemed to think separating us wouldn't matter, so she straightforwardly took Kathy away.

Before leaving, Kathy gave me a look, her gaze falling on the bag she left behind.

I got the hint and quickly got up to open the bag after they left.

Sure enough, there was a small phone inside. I quickly took it out and hid it under my pillow, my heart pounding.

Soon, Shirley brought Kathy back. Kathy sighed, "You really know how to have kids. Those two look just like you."

Unexpectedly, Shirley showed disdain and retorted, "Ms. Patel, you're mistaken. I've been taking care of the kids, and they clearly look like Mr. Jordan!"

Kathy rolled her eyes. "Who are you to interrupt my conversation with Caroline? Besides, the kids are Caroline's. Who else would they look like? You?"

"Look at yourself. If they looked like you, they'd be so ugly!"

"You..."

Shirley, repeatedly rebuked by Kathy, finally couldn't hold back and glared at her viciously.

I saw that look clearly and felt delighted. If it weren't for Shirley, I would have applauded Kathy.

Kathy didn't stay long and left, while Shirley drew the curtains again, blocking out the sunlight.

After she left, I took the phone Kathy gave me to the bathroom and successfully made a call.

Kathy had thought of everything. The phone she gave me only had calling functions, so it had a long standby time, and I didn't have to worry about charging it.

I set the phone to silent, put it in a bag, stood on the toilet, and hid it in the ceiling vent, then restored everything.

This phone was my last card. I couldn't let Brandon or Shirley find it.

Soon, Brandon rushed back from the office.

Kathy just came to see me, and it made Brandon very uneasy.

He came to my room and asked, "Caroline, did Kathy come by earlier?"

I nodded. "She even complained, saying you never let her visit me, and she's upset."

Brandon gave an awkward smile. "I'll invite her to dinner to apologize."

Then he suddenly took off his coat. "Caroline, it's been a while since we slept in the same bed. I'll sleep with you today."

I couldn't say no, so I nodded.

Brandon got into bed, lying behind me and holding me for a long time without moving.

I pretended to be asleep until he called my name twice, "Caroline?"

Seeing I didn't move, he got up and searched under my pillow.

I immediately understood. Shirley must have told him everything that happened with Kathy.

I felt a wave of fear. If I hadn't hidden the phone earlier, he would have found it by now.

He soon gave up when he found nothing, but then I felt him get up and go to the bathroom.

I knew Brandon was extremely cautious and would check all potential risks.

He closed the bathroom door.

I turned and saw his silhouette through the frosted glass. He wasn't using the toilet; he was searching for anything Kathy might have left for me.

He soon searched the bathroom thoroughly and looked up at the ceiling.

And that was where I hid the phone.

My heart instantly raced.

If he opened the vent, he would definitely find the phone I hid!

###chapter 8

But fortunately, Brandon didn't notice anything unusual. He quickly left the bathroom, picked up his coat, and left the room.

I took a deep breath and felt my whole body suddenly relax.

The consequence of complete relaxation was that I rarely lay in bed and slept without any worries, never feeling as at ease as I did at that moment.

But the consequence of falling asleep was that when I woke up, Brandon was sitting next to me, staring at me.

I was just glad that I didn't open my eyes the moment I woke up.

His gloomy gaze lingered on me for a long time, making me feel creepy.

I pretended to be asleep, not daring to relax even a bit.

After a while, Shirley came in with a bowl of medicine: "Is Caroline still sleeping? The medicine is ready."

Brandon didn't say anything, and Shirley reached out to wake me up.

I then pretended to wake up and saw Brandon: "Brandon? Why are you here?"

He smiled slightly, but there seemed to be an inexplicable meaning hidden behind that expression.

"I'm here to accompany you to drink the medicine, Caroline."

His expression made me feel uneasy, as if he had seen through something.

While drinking the medicine, I secretly observed Brandon's expression, carefully recalling what had happened today.

After checking the bathroom, Brandon left, and then he inexplicably sat here staring at me drinking the medicine. Could it be that there was something wrong with the medicine?

But the medicine I was drinking was exactly the same as before, so what went wrong?

I carefully recalled everything that happened today and suddenly realized, right, the bathroom!

When I was vomiting the medicine into the toilet, maybe some medicine splashed on the edge, and he might have noticed it.

Brandon started acting strange after going to the bathroom. He didn't find the phone, so it must be because of this.

Understanding the key to the problem, I quickly thought of a solution while drinking the medicine.

Suddenly, I figured it out.

After drinking the medicine in one gulp, I quickly ran into the bathroom before the two of them left the room and started vomiting into the toilet.

In fact, I was forcing myself to vomit.

Sure enough, Brandon and Shirley were stunned when they saw this scene.

Shirley hurried forward: "Mrs. Jordan, don't vomit, the medicine will be useless if you do."

Brandon also came to the bathroom.

I ignored what she said and vomited everything out, then sat down in the bathroom.

Brandon stood with his hands in his pockets, looking down at me.

"Caroline, why did you vomit the medicine?"

I looked at him and weakly said, "I'm sorry, Brandon. Actually, I've been feeling nauseous and wanting to vomit every time I drink this medicine these days, but I was afraid you'd worry, so I secretly vomited it out. This time, I really couldn't hold it in."

Acting, let's see who can act better.

Sure enough, Brandon's scrutinizing gaze softened after hearing what I said. He bent down and gently picked me up.

"Aren't we a couple? You should have told me earlier so I could help you find a solution, you know?"

His fingers were cold, touching my cheek like an icy dagger, making me shiver.

I nodded weakly in agreement.

With that, Brandon completely let go of his suspicion and stood up, saying to Shirley, "Go make another bowl of medicine for Caroline, and this time, don't let her vomit it out."

I didn't say anything, but my heart was filled with anger.

This damned Brandon, why is he poisoning me? How can he be so heartless?

It seemed that I had no choice but to drink this bowl of medicine today.

Soon, Shirley brought the medicine. She handed it to me and watched me drink it.

After I lay down, she watched me for a long time, making sure I didn't vomit the medicine before leaving.

But when I wanted to go to the bathroom to vomit, I couldn't.

It seemed that this method of vomiting the medicine wouldn't work in the future. I had to come up with another solution.

But Shirley watched me drink the medicine every time. How could I vomit it in front of her?

Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to think. The medicine I just drank took effect, making me fall asleep immediately.

When I woke up, it was already midnight. I didn't know how long I had slept, but I felt completely drained of energy, as if something had sucked the life out of me.

I opened my mouth, wanting to call Shirley to get me some water, but found that my throat couldn't make a sound.

I remembered Brandon mentioning increasing the dosage and immediately understood. It seemed that this was the increased dosage.

I felt like I was nailed to the bed, staring at the dark ceiling, feeling a deep sense of despair.

I felt especially isolated and helpless that night, as if I had been abandoned by the whole world.

I lay there for a long time until I felt a bit of strength returning. I struggled to get out of bed but collapsed to the floor due to lack of strength.

I crawled towards the bathroom, using all my strength to stand by the toilet and retrieve my phone.

But as I was coming down, I felt dizzy and fell to the floor, hitting my head hard on the sink.

I felt a sharp pain in my forehead, and blood started flowing profusely.

My ears were ringing from the impact.

But I gritted my teeth and didn't make a sound, afraid that Shirley or Brandon would find out and my phone would be exposed.

I sat on the toilet and called Kathy.

Fortunately, she liked to stay up late and hadn't gone to bed yet. She answered the phone, sounding very excited.

"Caroline, do you know how long I've been waiting for your call? You didn't even call to let me know you're safe!"

"Kathy."

I opened my mouth and realized my voice was hoarse and unpleasant, like it had been ground by gravel.

Kathy was also startled: "Caroline, what's wrong?"

"There's something wrong with the medicine. Can you help me get it tested? I can't move at all right now."

Kathy knew the situation was urgent and quickly agreed.

"I understand, but if I go, it might arouse suspicion. I'll find someone to go to your house, and you can secretly give them the medicine. I'll let you know the results once it's tested."

With Kathy's promise, I felt relieved. After hanging up, I hid the phone in the toilet tank.

Then I struggled to crawl back to bed. The bleeding on my forehead had stopped, and the blood had dried on my face, but I had no strength to deal with it and slowly closed my eyes.

The next morning, I was woken up by Shirley's scream.

Brandon rushed to my room upon hearing the noise: "What's wrong? What happened?"

Shirley, shocked, pointed at me: "Mrs. Jordan's face is covered in blood!"

Brandon was also startled and came forward to ask what had happened.

I answered truthfully: "I hit the sink when I went to the bathroom last night."

I just left out the part about taking out my phone to call Kathy.

###chapter 9

Shirley came forward to treat the wound. I don't know if it was because of this wound, but today they didn't force me to take the medicine.

I was able to catch my breath for two days.

I don't know what kind of medicine Brandon and the others gave me, but it seemed to make me feel weak all over, dizzy, and drowsy.

If this goes on for a long time, I'm afraid I might die without anyone knowing the cause, and they would just think I had a prolonged illness.

Thinking of this, my heart was filled with resentment.

Brandon and Shirley are really too vicious, but why are they doing this? Do they simply want Shirley to become the mistress of this house and thus want to kill me?

I thought of his study again. The keys in Brandon's briefcase could only open two of the drawers, while the other drawers remained locked.

But what exactly is inside that is so important that he hides the keys?

I am certain that there must be a secret about Brandon poisoning me in there.

But recently, I haven't had the same opportunity as last time, and I can't go to his study to investigate.

It wasn't until the wound on my forehead scabbed over that Shirley brought the medicine bowl to me again.

I was thinking about how to get rid of her when the children suddenly started crying at the same time.

I breathed a sigh of relief: Children, thank you.

I poured all the medicine onto a towel I had prepared in advance, then smeared some around my mouth to make it look like I had just finished drinking it.

When Shirley came back to collect the bowl, I said impatiently, "Don't bother me next, I'm dizzy and need to rest."

She didn't say anything, turned around, and left with the bowl.

I quickly jumped out of bed, put the towel in a plastic bag to prevent the medicine from evaporating.

As usual, I hid it in the toilet tank.

Now I just have to wait for Kathy's person to come.

According to her, Kathy would send someone in yellow clothes to meet me.

But I never saw anyone until suddenly a construction worker stood in the yard checking the pipes, and he was wearing a fluorescent yellow safety vest.

I realized this was the person Kathy mentioned, but now I had to find a way to meet him.

These days, to avoid arousing Shirley's suspicion, I drank the medicine every time, although I would induce vomiting after she left, I could only vomit about half of it, so I still felt extremely weak.

I leaned on the bed and asked Shirley to open the curtains.

I pretended to look at the weather outside: "The weather is really nice today, why don't you push me out to get some sun?"

Shirley hesitated a bit, and I glared at her: "What? I can't even go out to get some sun now? Are you planning to keep me locked in this room all day?"

I don't know if my words made Shirley feel guilty, but she nodded in agreement, then went out and brought in a wheelchair for me to sit in.

I was pushed to the garden, pretending to bask in the sun, but my eyes were always on the man in the safety vest.

The man obviously noticed me too and approached me inconspicuously.

Shirley was also watching the other construction workers, afraid they would damage the flowers in the garden.

At this moment, the man accidentally bumped into me and quickly turned around to apologize.

"Sorry, Mrs. Jordan, I didn't mean to."

Shirley frowned at him: "Can you be more careful? Mrs. Jordan is still sick!"

I waved my hand to indicate it was okay.

I asked, "What are you fixing?"

The man looked at me and replied, "Pipe maintenance, there's a leak in the neighborhood."

I nodded and suddenly said, "By the way, the pipe in my bathroom isn't working well either, the screws seem a bit loose, can you help tighten them?"

Shirley had been listening to our conversation and asked, "Loose screws? Why didn't Mrs. Jordan tell me?"

I shook my head: "It's not a big deal, but since there's a worker here, let's fix this small problem too."

So, Shirley couldn't say anything more and had to agree.

Before going upstairs, I specifically told the man to pay attention to the area around the toilet. If he was sent by Kathy, he should understand.

Sure enough, his eyes flashed, and he nodded.

Shirley followed us upstairs, but with her there, the worker couldn't do anything, so I kept an eye on the second-floor window and then deliberately fell out of the wheelchair.

"Ouch, Shirley, Shirley, come quickly!"

I cried out in pain and called her, and she quickly ran down: "Mrs. Jordan, what happened?"

I pointed to my foot: "I twisted my ankle, take me back to my room."

Shirley nodded and pushed me back.

On the way back, I met the worker, and I asked, "Did you tighten the screws?"

The worker nodded: "Don't worry, there was some dirt in the toilet tank, I've cleaned it up."

Our question and answer didn't make Shirley suspicious, but it reassured me.

I knew he had taken the item.

Back in the room, I couldn't wait to go to the bathroom and open the toilet tank. Sure enough, the towel with the medicine I had put in a plastic bag was gone, but the phone was still there.

I breathed a sigh of relief and returned to bed.

In the coming days, I just had to wait for the drug test results.

During this time, I also prepared to find another opportunity to go to Brandon's study to see what other secrets he was hiding.

But recently, his work schedule was regular, and Shirley was following her routine, leaving me no chance.

I could only lie in bed every day, praying for an opportunity to come soon.

But soon, I got my chance. The property management notified us that there would be a power outage for maintenance tonight, but unfortunately, Brandon and Shirley had already finished dinner and wouldn't be going out.

I had to wait until they were asleep to go to the study.

Soon it was midnight, and I quietly opened the door.

The house was silent, but I knew this time was different from last time.

This time, both Brandon and Shirley were home, and I couldn't make any noise, or I would definitely be discovered.

I first went downstairs, opened Brandon's briefcase, and took out the keys.

Then I quietly moved upstairs, not daring to make a sound.

Suddenly, I felt something rush towards me, and I was startled, almost making a noise.

After calming down, I found it was just the cat, Nala. It looked at me and then sat beside me licking its paws.

I breathed a sigh of relief and continued towards Brandon's study.

Upstairs, I didn't dare to turn on the light, so I groped around by the moonlight.

After confirming the position of the desk, I opened the drawers I had opened before. The phone inside had been moved, indicating that Brandon had checked it later.

###chapter 10

I took out my phone and carefully checked if there was anything else in it, but Brandon seemed to know that this drawer was easy to open, so he didn't put anything important in it, just some miscellaneous items.

I opened another cabinet, and it was the same.

The only important thing was some scattered cash inside.

I suddenly realized that since I had been sick for so long, I had no money left on me, and even if I wanted to escape, I couldn't.

So I reached out and took some of the thick stack of cash, stuffing it into my pocket. This way, even if something unexpected happened in the future, I would have some security.

I was so focused on searching that I didn't notice the footsteps outside the study.

By the time I realized it, the study door was suddenly pushed open.

I was startled and quickly hid under the desk.

I heard Brandon ask in a deep voice, "Who?"

I held my breath, not daring to make a sound.

My heart was pounding like a drum, and I looked at the drawer. From Brandon's angle, he couldn't see that it was open, but if he walked over, he would definitely see it.

I closed my eyes, praying that Brandon wouldn't come over.

At that moment, I heard him say, "Caroline, is that you?"

My hair stood on end, and cold sweat broke out all over my body. My heart felt like it was about to jump out of my mouth.

Even more terrifying, I could hear Brandon's footsteps moving.

My mind raced, thinking about what excuse I could use if he found me.

But just then, I heard something fall to the ground at the door, followed by a meow.

Brandon seemed to relax, "It's you!"

"When did I lock you in here?"

He spoke as he walked out, closing the study door behind him.

I let out a heavy sigh of relief, collapsing weakly to the ground. I realized that my little cat had saved me!

But tonight, I couldn't continue. Although I didn't find anything important, I did get something.

I closed and locked the drawer, then quietly went downstairs and put the key back in Brandon's bag.

On the way back, I felt a burning sensation in my chest, as if there was a fire inside me.

No matter how much water I drank, it didn't help, so I went to the fridge and grabbed an ice cream to cool down.

When I got back to my room, just as I pushed the door open, I heard a faint voice from inside.

"Caroline, where did you go?"

My scalp tightened, and in the darkness, a pair of malicious eyes stared straight at me.

I was so scared that I couldn't speak.

Brandon stepped forward and turned on the room light with a swipe. Reflexively, I hid what I was holding behind my back.

His sinister eyes stared straight at me, "Where did you go? What's behind your back?"

I was so scared that I couldn't speak, so I just shook my head.

He stepped forward and forcefully pulled my hand over, only to be stunned when he saw the ice cream in my hand.

"You went downstairs just to get this?"

I nodded, thinking that luckily I had hidden the money in my pant leg earlier, or he would have definitely found it.

"Shirley's dinner was really spicy tonight. After eating, my stomach hurt so much that I had to go get an ice cream."

My explanation was reasonable, making it hard for Brandon not to believe me.

He gave me a helpless look, "Caroline, you can't eat ice cream. It's too cold. I'll ask Shirley to make milder food in the future."

He said this as he carried me to bed and took the ice cream from my hand.

I obediently nodded and lay under the covers.

He watched me for a long time without leaving, then reached out and stroked my face with the back of his hand.

"Caroline, you mustn't lie to me in the future."

My heart pounded, thinking he had discovered something, so I quickly nodded.

But he didn't say anything, just turned and left.

I hid under the covers, took the money from my pant leg, and put it with my phone.

After confirming everything, I let out a long sigh of relief. It seemed I had passed this hurdle for now.

But I couldn't go to Brandon's study again for the time being. I would have to find a way to get to the office to find the key and discover new things.

That night, after relaxing, I fell asleep.

The next morning, when I woke up, Brandon was sitting by my window, fully dressed, looking at me gently.

"Caroline, you're awake?"

I nodded, looking at him. I knew today was Saturday, and Brandon usually chose to rest at this time and wouldn't go to the office.

He seemed to know what I was thinking and said, "I'm planning to visit Mom today. She's been traveling all year and just got back recently."

My heart tightened, and I looked at him warily.

During the year I was sick, my mom, Kelly Kim, had been traveling and didn't know about my condition.

I didn't want her to worry, so I hadn't told her.

But now that I thought about it, it was strange that Kelly had gone traveling just as I got sick. It seemed like Brandon had arranged it to get her out of the way.

But what did he mean by telling me this now?

"Do you have anything you want to say to Mom?"

I shook my head. No matter the reason, I didn't want Kelly to know about my current situation and worry.

Brandon didn't say anything else and left after saying goodbye.

Shirley watched me take my medicine, and after she left, I went to the bathroom to induce vomiting.

This time, I was very careful, leaving no trace.

I stood by the window, watching Brandon drive away.

Kelly lived in a suburban villa, and if he drove himself, he wouldn't be back until midnight.

So it was very likely he would stay there overnight and return tomorrow.

And it seemed that with Brandon gone, Shirley wasn't too concerned about watching me take my medicine. After I took it, she just took the bowl away without checking if I had vomited.

I took the opportunity while she was in her room to lock my door and hide in the bathroom to call Kathy.

I had too many questions and didn't know what to do.

I had to take this chance to ask Kathy for advice.

The call went through quickly, and Kathy answered.

"What's up, Caroline? Are those bastards not home? How can you call me during the day?"

I told her about Brandon going to Kelly's house and that only Shirley was left in the house.

"I can't understand Brandon anymore. Why is he trying to harm me?"

"Is it because of the company? But I had already handed over most of the company's business to him before I got sick. I don't pose any threat to him. Why is he doing this?"

###chapter 11

Kathy said she couldn't understand Brandon either.

"Do you think it's because he wants to make Shirley his wife?"

I frowned, thinking about Shirley and Brandon's interactions, and felt a wave of nausea.

"So he wants to kill me for Shirley?"

I couldn't stop the resentment in my heart. I've been married to Brandon for so many years, and does that mean nothing compared to the short time he's been with Shirley?

Seeing me angry, Kathy comforted me, "There might be other reasons. Anyway, Brandon is not a good person."

"Caroline, you must gather more evidence and bring down that bastard Brandon."

I nodded. Even if Kathy hadn't said it, I planned to do so.

I couldn't just watch them take over my family's assets and kick me out.

I would never allow them to do that.

"Why do you think Brandon went to see my mom?"

Kathy thought for a while and said, "Maybe your recent actions have made him suspicious?"

"But Brandon can't warn you directly, so he indirectly tells you that Kelly is now under his control."

"If you don't understand, then fine, but if you do, it means you're guilty!"

I suddenly understood. No wonder Brandon's gaze was so meaningful before he left this morning.

We discussed some details, and to avoid being discovered by Shirley, I hung up the phone and hid my cell phone.

It seemed that whatever I planned to do, I had to stop for now to avoid arousing Brandon's suspicion.

After dinner, I realized I hadn't seen Nala all day, so I decided to look for her.

Passing by Brandon's study, I heard scratching sounds from inside.

I quickly opened the door and let Nala out, holding her and looking at her.

"Poor Nala, have you been locked in here all day?"

I played with Nala, but out of the corner of my eye, I suddenly saw a red light flashing.

I was stunned and instinctively felt something was wrong, so I pretended to play with Nala while glancing at the object.

It turned out that in the corner of the study, a small device was flashing a red light.

If I hadn't looked closely, I wouldn't have noticed it.

Connecting it to its location, I immediately understood.

Brandon was monitoring me.

His visit to Kelly's house was not only to threaten me but also to lure me into his trap.

He had Shirley pretend to be indifferent, while he installed surveillance at the study door to see if I would sneak into his study.

I sneered, not expecting Brandon to be so cunning, but he probably didn't expect me to discover it.

I turned and left with Nala, and I never bothered with the study again.

At this moment, he was probably watching the study, waiting for the surveillance to catch me, but I was already asleep with Nala in my bed.

Recently, although I stopped taking that medicine, my health was still as bad as ever.

The previous medication must have caused irreversible damage to my body, so I could only try to rest and recuperate.

The next morning, Brandon returned.

Perhaps he noticed nothing unusual about me, so he was in a very good mood.

I knew why he was happy, but I still pretended to be clueless and asked, "Brandon, why are you so happy?"

Brandon chuckled, "I saw Mom, and she's doing well. Caroline, you can rest assured."

But I didn't feel relieved. I didn't know if I could trust his words.

I wanted to call Kelly, but I was afraid of exposing the situation, so I gave up.

Thinking back to when my parents advised me not to marry Brandon, I felt both angry and regretful.

I was angry at myself for falling for a heartless bastard like Brandon, and I regretted not listening to my parents.

Brandon and I started dating in college. My parents disapproved of his background and wanted to introduce me to someone of similar status.

But I was determined to be with him and even secretly married him.

At that time, Brandon didn't want people to think he was with me for my family's money, so he worked hard to support me.

But as my father aged and fell seriously ill, he had no choice but to give me the company and arrange for Brandon to work there.

After my father passed away, I gradually managed the company smoothly.

When I became pregnant with Brett, I started handing over the company's core business to Brandon.

By the time I was pregnant with the boy-girl twins, I had completely let go of the company. Now, apart from my shares, I knew nothing about the company.

If only I had listened to my parents back then.

Thinking of this, a tear fell from my eye.

Brandon saw it and gently wiped it away, "What's wrong, Caroline?"

I shook my head, "I just miss Mom. I want to call her."

Of course, Brandon shook his head in disagreement.

Every time I brought this up, he always brushed it off.

Given my current voice, it was obvious I was sick, so for a long time, Brandon had been the only one in contact with Kelly.

I didn't expect him to agree, as he was guilty and didn't dare to.

That night, I returned to my room. Today was the day the test results came out.

In the dead of night, I called Kathy.

The call was quickly answered, and Kathy's voice sounded complicated.

"Caroline, this is really strange. Do you know what kind of medicine Brandon gave you?"

"Go ahead, I'm prepared."

She continued, "They're all normal medicines, and even together, they have no toxicity. They're just ordinary medicines."

I was stunned.

Ordinary medicines?

But I knew my body's reactions weren't fake. If they were just ordinary medicines, why would I have such reactions?

"Impossible. Did you test the wrong thing?"

"It was taken from your house that day, no mistake."

After hanging up, I was confused.

I always thought Brandon was poisoning me, but Kathy told me they were just ordinary medicines.

Could it be that Brandon never intended to harm me? Was it all a misunderstanding?

I quickly dismissed that thought.

I was now certain that Brandon was cheating, and he was indeed keeping me under surveillance. So there must be something else about my health that I didn't know about, or he wouldn't need to do this.

I decided to find an opportunity to get a thorough check-up, or I might never understand Brandon's true intentions.

###chapter 12

Next, I observed Brandon and Shirley at home, trying to find out why they were treating me this way, while waiting for an opportunity.

Unfortunately, Brandon and Shirley always behaved like an employer and a nanny, without any unusual behavior.

Until one night, after dinner, I saw Brandon and Shirley exchange a glance, and then Shirley got up: "Mrs. Jordan, take your time eating. Just leave the dishes there when you're done, I'll wash them in the morning. I'm not feeling well today, so I'll go to bed early."

"I've kept your medicine warm, you can take it later."

I knew they were definitely up to something tonight, so after they went into the room, I quietly walked to the master bedroom door.

Because Brandon had a habit of locking the door when he slept, he wasn't worried about me suddenly coming in.

And Shirley wasn't afraid of me standing outside.

I pressed my ear to the door and heard the voices inside.

Shirley spoke first: "Caroline is so annoying, I have to take care of her all day. When can I become the real Mrs. Jordan?"

Brandon's voice was low: "Aren't you already? The Mrs. Jordan who sleeps with me!"

Even though I was mentally prepared, hearing this still made me feel nauseous and want to kill the two of them right then and there.

But I knew I couldn't do that, I had to endure it.

Shirley continued to complain: "That medicine is useless, Caroline is still stubbornly alive. I know of a medicine that, after taking it, won't take a few days..."

My heart was in my throat. If Brandon really did what Shirley said, I wouldn't be able to escape.

At that time, I would have to leave my children and escape first, but it would be difficult to get my children back later.

Just then, I heard a loud slap from inside.

"Shirley, don't think you're irreplaceable. I can make you Mrs. Jordan, and I can make someone else Mrs. Jordan too."

"My matters with Caroline, you are not to interfere in the future."

I was stunned. Did Shirley not know about Brandon's plan? Otherwise, why didn't she know that the medicine Brandon gave me was not poisonous at all?

And from what he said, Brandon didn't seem to love Shirley very much, so what was he after?

I couldn't figure it out.

Inside, Shirley seemed to be stunned by the slap, and then a scolding voice followed: "Get out!"

I came to my senses and quickly went downstairs, afraid of being caught eavesdropping.

I sat back at the dining table, and Shirley came downstairs too.

There was a red handprint on her face, looking particularly conspicuous.

She saw me and glared at me with jealousy, then went into the kitchen.

I pretended not to see her look and asked loudly: "Shirley, what happened to your face? Why is it red?"

Shirley took a long time to answer: "It's nothing."

She was probably furious inside, but this was the only thing that made me happy during this time.

After finishing my meal, I went back to my room and read a book by the bedside.

After a while, Brandon knocked and came in, holding my medicine bowl.

"Caroline, did you forget to take your medicine?"

Thinking about his mouth that had just been intimate with Shirley, now speaking sweet words to me, made me feel sick.

I took the bowl from his hand and smiled: "I'm in a good mood today, I want to read a bit before taking the medicine."

Brandon didn't object, nodded, and said: "I might have to go on a business trip in a few days. If you have any inconvenience at home, just ask Shirley."

My eyes lit up, realizing an opportunity had come.

"Okay, take care."

Brandon nodded, leaned in, and kissed my forehead.

"Caroline, take your medicine and go to bed early. Good night."

After he left the room, I closed the book with a cold face.

I looked at the medicine bowl on the bedside table. Even though I knew it wasn't poisonous, I had no intention of drinking it. There was definitely something wrong with it.

I poured the medicine into the toilet and flushed it, my mind drifting away.

At night, when everyone was asleep, I texted Kathy, telling her about Brandon's business trip and that only Shirley would be home.

I felt I had to take this opportunity to escape, it was the only chance.

After receiving Kathy's reply, I put away my phone and went to bed.

A few days later, it was the day of Brandon's business trip.

I stood in the yard to see him off, then turned to look at Shirley.

Since the day Brandon slapped her, Shirley always looked at me with jealousy and resentment.

And I pretended not to see it.

It was time to figure out how to walk out of this cage openly.

That night, I sat in the living room, watching Shirley prepare my medicine in the kitchen, and suddenly had an idea.

Since she used this medicine to make me sleep, why not make her drink it instead?

With this thought, I knew what to do.

I deliberately walked to the kitchen and said: "Shirley, I have a beauty soup recipe from my hometown. My mom used to drink it often, and every time she drank it, her face looked ten years younger. I want to make it later, do you want to drink it with me?"

What woman wouldn't be tempted by that? Shirley hesitated a bit, then agreed.

Actually, I didn't know any beauty soup recipe. I boiled water on the stove and unceremoniously poured all the medicine she made for me into the pot. To cover the taste, I added sugar and salt.

I tasted it, and it was bitter, sweet, and salty, completely masking the taste of the medicine.

Then I brought the pot of soup to the table and called Shirley over to drink.

Shirley didn't hesitate to pick up the bowl and drink, but she spat it out after one sip.

After all, the soup tasted terrible.

"This is too awful."

I smiled: "Beauty soup is always like this, that's why it works!"

With my persuasion, Shirley soon drank quite a bit, showing a stuffed expression.

I let her sit on the sofa, and soon she started to feel drowsy, ready to fall asleep on the sofa.

I knew the power of this medicine well. Once taken, it wouldn't wake up for ten hours, no matter what happened.

After she was completely asleep, I tested her breath with my hand and called her twice.

Confirming she was fully asleep, I went back to my room, put on my coat, grabbed my phone, and slipped out.

Just then, I heard a voice behind me: "Don't go."

I was startled, feeling my blood run cold.

I never expected the medicine to only work on me. As I was thinking of an explanation, I heard her say: "Brandon, don't go!"

###chapter 13

I turned my head in horror, only to see Shirley lying on the sofa, occasionally muttering in her sleep.

It was then that I realized she was talking in her sleep.

These days, I've been so on edge because of Brandon that just hearing his name triggers a reflex in me.

But as I calmed down and recalled what Shirley was saying in her sleep, I couldn't help but sneer.

Brandon?

You really want to take my place and become the mistress of this house.

But you need to see if you're worthy!

I let out a cold laugh and walked out.

Outside the neighborhood, Kathy saw me coming out and honked the horn.

I rushed into the car and, seeing Kathy's familiar face, couldn't help but hug her tightly.

I never thought I would actually get out. I once had the thought that maybe I would never leave that villa, that maybe I would die in there.

But now, here I am, completely out!

Kathy is my long-time friend; she understands me the best.

"Alright, there are others in the car, aren't you embarrassed?"

I was taken aback and looked up to see a man sitting in the back of the car, and his face looked very familiar.

But I was sure I had never seen this person before.

"Who are you?"

I knew Kathy wouldn't easily tell others about my situation, so this person must be trustworthy.

To my surprise, the man took out a fake mustache from his pocket and stuck it on his face, and I immediately recognized him.

"You're the plumber who came to our house that day!"

The man smiled and nodded. At the time, I only noticed his big beard and didn't realize that underneath it, his face was unexpectedly handsome and refined.

Kathy introduced him to me: "His name is Simon Lawson, a private detective I hired. He's really good in a fight."

I nodded and thanked him.

After all, Simon really helped me a lot that day. If it weren't for him, I might still be trapped in a fog of conspiracy.

Simon smiled slightly, "You paid me, so I have to give it my all."

After the greetings, Kathy took me directly to a private hospital.

As she unbuckled her seatbelt, she said to me, "Because of the medicine Brandon gave you, there's a very skilled doctor on duty today. Let's have him take a look."

I was filled with gratitude. If it weren't for Kathy, I might never have escaped.

But the words of thanks would have to wait. I was afraid something might happen back home, so I quickly entered the hospital.

After a few steps, I felt out of breath, as if all my strength had been drained, and I squatted on the ground, gasping like a dying fish.

I was anxious, but after a few more steps, my legs gave out.

At this moment, Simon suddenly stepped forward, picked me up horizontally, and carried me into the doctor's consultation room.

After I sat down, the doctor carefully examined me.

His graying eyebrows furrowed deeply, and he said to Kathy, "Let me see the medicine she was taking."

Kathy quickly handed over the lab test results. The test sheet only listed the name of the medicine, and it didn't seem unusual.

Seeing the doctor remain silent for a long time, Kathy anxiously asked, "Doctor, is the combination of these medicines toxic?"

The doctor slowly shook his head, "These medicines are not problematic at all; in fact, the combination is extremely precise."

The three of us were stunned and exchanged glances.

How could this be?

Then what's wrong with my body?

At this moment, the doctor pointed at me, "The problem lies with you. Your body is the weakest I've ever seen in my practice. If you continue taking this formula, you will certainly die within a year."

"Did you recently give birth?"

I quickly nodded.

The doctor looked as if he had hit the mark.

"After giving birth, your body is already very weak, and based on your condition, you must have had twins, which is even more taxing on the body."

"Your body is weak now and should be nourished with medicine, but this medicine has been depleting your energy instead. Essentially, you should be replenishing nutrients, but the medicine has been consuming your body."

"Over time, you naturally feel weak all over. You've already harmed your body."

The doctor sighed slightly, "The doctor who prescribed this medicine is extremely malicious. If you continue taking it, you will undoubtedly die."

Kathy and I exchanged a deep breath.

At this moment, I felt a deep sense of fear.

If I hadn't noticed something wrong with the medicine, I might have already died unknowingly, and the culprits Brandon and Shirley would have completely taken over my home and company, erasing me from this world.

"Alright, I'll prescribe some medicine to slowly nurse you back to health, but this will be a long process. Don't expect a quick recovery."

I quickly thanked him, took the medicine, and left the consultation room with Kathy and Simon.

As soon as we stepped out, Kathy couldn't help but curse through gritted teeth, "Brandon, that bastard, how could he be so vicious? Isn't he afraid of God's punishment?"

Simon was also silent for a long time before saying, "I've been a private detective for many years. I've seen people hire hitmen and tamper with cars to cause accidents, but I've never seen such a sinister and ruthless method."

"If it weren't for your keen observation, it would have gone unnoticed."

I didn't speak for a long time, feeling as if my heart was being tightly squeezed by an invisible hand.

I didn't understand why Brandon and Shirley would treat me this way.

I was so good to both of them. My heart was full of Brandon, and I even treated Shirley like family, but they...

Just as I was immersed in grief and anger, Kathy suddenly said in confusion, "Isn't that Brandon's assistant up ahead? I think I've seen this person on Brandon's Facebook!"

I looked up and saw that it was indeed his assistant, Moira Langley!

There was no way for us to go back, and Moira was clearly heading in our direction, so we were bound to run into her.

Simon made a quick decision, "Run!"

He pulled me to the other side of the warehouse, while Kathy stayed behind to buy us some time to escape.

Simon and I hid in the room where the hospital stored bed sheets and covers, with Kathy standing outside.

I listened nervously to the sounds inside, hearing Kathy intercept Moira.

"Aren't you Brandon's assistant? Langley, right?"

Moira didn't recognize Kathy and asked, "Who are you?"

"I'm Caroline, a good friend of your former boss Caroline, and a good friend of your current boss Brandon's wife!"

"Oh, I see. Hello."

Moira's voice was polite but distant.

But Kathy didn't intend to let her leave so easily, "Are you sick too? The doctors here are really good. I just had a check-up."

###chapter 14

Moira shook her head, "No, our boss Mr. Jordan caught a cold and asked me to get some cold medicine for him."

"Oh, by the way, do you know how Caroline is doing? Brandon won't let me see her."

"We're not sure either, you should ask Mr. Jordan."

"Mr. Jordan is in a hurry to take his medicine, so I won't chat with you!"

I was inside, listening in surprise. Brandon is clearly on a business trip, so why would he be in a hurry to take medicine?

Besides, wouldn't he buy medicine in the city where he's on a business trip?

I suddenly had a bad feeling, that Brandon might not be on a business trip at all, or he might have already returned.

I exchanged a glance with Simon, and it was clear he understood what I meant.

Meanwhile, Kathy let Moira and the others go, and after they entered the clinic, she opened the door to let us out.

I shared my suspicions with her, and she quickly said, "Then what are you waiting for? Hurry back, or if Brandon gets home and finds you're not there, everything will be exposed!"

We ran to Kathy's car, and she drove me back.

Fortunately, we hadn't wasted much time when we came, and now, arriving at the community gate, only two hours had passed.

After saying goodbye to Simon and Kathy, I ran into the villa.

The villa was quiet at the moment, with only the sound of Shirley snoring.

Looking at her, I remembered the doctor's diagnosis earlier and got very angry.

So I went upstairs to my room, found my long-unused and expired makeup, and smeared it all over Shirley's face, leaving it on for a long time.

Seeing her face starting to swell and turn red, I finally smiled with satisfaction.

Just then, the children started crying simultaneously, so I quickly picked them up and tried to soothe them in the living room.

Brandon walked in to see this scene and was taken aback.

"Why aren't you sleeping today?"

I pretended to be weak and pointed at Shirley, "She somehow fell asleep in the living room and didn't take care of the kids. Their crying woke me up, and I couldn't wake her."

Before I finished speaking, Brandon's face was already filled with anger. He walked over and gave Shirley a hard push.

But she didn't wake up at all, even snoring louder.

So Brandon picked up a glass of water from the coffee table and unceremoniously splashed it on Shirley's face, finally waking her up.

"The kids are crying, and you don't even know? Still sleeping here!"

Shirley finally realized what was happening and quickly apologized, "Maybe I didn't sleep well last night. I'll take care of it now."

Saying that, she took the children from my arms.

The children, who had been crying non-stop, suddenly quieted down when they smelled her.

Shirley looked at me smugly, "Mrs. Jordan, the kids don't recognize you. You should wake me up to take care of them in the future."

Looking at my empty arms, I felt a deep sense of loss.

Brandon came over and took my hand, "Alright, let Shirley take care of it. You're not well, go back to bed and rest."

He led me back to the room, and I finally had a chance to ask him, "Weren't you on a business trip? Why are you back?"

He shook his head, "The flight was delayed, so I didn't go. I'll stay with you today."

I knew he was hinting at something.

In the past, I would have agreed, but now, just thinking about him cheating on me with Shirley made me feel sick. Seeing his face made me want to vomit.

I shook my head, "Taking care of the kids today was exhausting, I want to rest."

He didn't mind and gently nodded, "Alright, Caroline, get some rest. I'll go out."

In front of me, he always played the role of a gentle and good husband.

If I didn't know his true nature, I might have been fooled by him!

The next morning, I went downstairs for breakfast and saw Shirley's face was already swollen.

Brandon looked at her with increasing impatience.

When she saw me, her swollen eyes filled with anger, glaring at me.

I innocently apologized, "I'm sorry, the beauty soup I made for you yesterday might have had too many ingredients. I didn't expect it to turn out like this."

Shirley still didn't speak, glaring at me with fierce eyes.

Brandon slammed his bowl down, "Alright, just go to the hospital today, it's not a big deal. Caroline was only trying to help you."

Shirley looked at Brandon with grievance, "What about the kids?"

Brandon frowned, "Caroline and I are both home, what are you worried about?"

She could only look at Brandon with resentment but didn't argue.

After breakfast, Shirley couldn't wait to go to the hospital, wanting her face to heal as soon as possible.

The kids started crying shortly after she left.

I quickly tried to soothe them, but they cried even harder when they saw me, as if they had seen a monster.

I realized something was wrong. I used to think the kids cried because they weren't familiar with me, but now it seemed they were scared of me. Why was that?

Brandon came in to soothe the kids, and I watched while glancing around the room.

I remembered there was a surveillance camera installed in the children's room, so if I could see the footage, I would know what happened.

Sure enough, I saw the camera in the corner, with a red light flashing, indicating it was working.

It seemed I needed to go to Brandon's study again, but this time to check his computer for the surveillance footage.

After Brandon calmed the kids, he told me to go rest.

Just then, there was a knock on the door.

I opened it to see Simon dressed as a plumber, standing at the door.

I was surprised and quickly exchanged a glance with him. I nodded subtly and said loudly, "You're the plumber from last time, right?"

Brandon came out, looking at Simon and then at me, his eyes full of suspicion.

"You know each other?"

I nodded, "He came to fix the pipes last time and helped me tighten the loose screws in the bathroom."

Brandon scrutinized Simon, "What are you doing here now?"

Simon spoke with a heavy accent, "Mr. Jordan, I'm from the property management. They said there's a water leak in the community, and I'm checking each house for leaks."

Brandon frowned, "This is supposed to be a high-end community, and there's always a water leak. It's annoying."

Simon quickly apologized, looking humble.

Eventually, Brandon let him in, and Simon went to the bathroom, pretending to check for leaks.

###chapter 15

Brandon obviously still hadn't let go of his suspicion towards Simon and followed him, seemingly determined to keep an eye on Simon until he left.

It was even stranger for me to stay here, as if I was nervous about something.

So I cleared my throat and said, "Brandon, I'm not feeling well. I'm going back to my room to rest."

It seemed that my action dispelled Brandon's suspicion. He relaxed his brows and nodded.

But when I returned to my room, I couldn't even sit down.

Simon suddenly appeared, surely with some information to share with me, but Brandon was always watching, making it impossible for us to talk.

I paced around the room for a long time until I suddenly heard Brandon shout, "What are you doing?"

I was startled and quickly ran over to check.

I saw that Simon had somehow broken a pipe in the bathroom, and now the bathroom was flooded, with water spraying all over Brandon.

Simon found a spot where the water couldn't reach him and apologized with a guilty look.

I knew this was Simon creating an opportunity for me, so I quickly frowned and glared at him.

"What do you mean by this? How could you get my husband all wet? Do you know how busy he usually is? If he catches a cold because of you, can you afford to compensate?"

Simon quickly apologized, and Brandon was also surprised by my sudden anger. He stepped forward and pulled me back.

"Forget it, Caroline. He didn't do it on purpose."

I was waiting for him to say that, so I quickly turned around and pretended to wipe the water off him with concern. "You're all dirty. Go inside and wash up. What if you catch a cold?"

After my outburst, Brandon seemed to no longer suspect that there was anything between Simon and me and went straight to his bedroom bathroom.

Seeing him leave, I quickly clasped my hands together and apologized to Simon.

"Sorry, if I didn't do that, he wouldn't believe you. I'm really sorry."

Simon shook his head, looking completely different from his previous timid and fearful demeanor.

"Time is limited, let's get to the point."

"After you left, Kathy went to that doctor again to modify the formula. Now, both the taste and color are almost identical to what they gave you before. Take me to replace the herbs, and you can drink this from now on."

I was delighted, not expecting them to act so quickly.

I looked upstairs to confirm there was no movement, then pulled Simon into the maid's room.

The herbal packets for my medicine were always kept in Shirley's room, and she would take them out every day to prepare my medicine.

Simon glanced around and quickly swapped the herbs, making it look exactly the same as before, so no one could tell the difference.

After the swap, Simon and I left Shirley's room.

At that moment, Brandon silently came downstairs.

Seeing him, I felt a wave of fear. If Simon hadn't acted quickly, we would have been caught in Shirley's room.

Brandon looked at Simon, who was fixing the pipe on the floor. "Are you done yet? Why is it taking so long to fix this pipe?"

Simon kept apologizing, and after tightening a screw, the leak in the bathroom was fixed.

He spoke in a local accent, "Sorry, Mr. Jordan, Mrs. Jordan, I'll clean it up for you."

Brandon impatiently nodded and then looked at me.

"Caroline, go back. There's nothing to see here."

Afraid of being exposed, I quickly slipped back to my room.

After a while, I heard noises from the villa's yard. I quietly opened a crack in the window and saw Brandon and Simon.

Brandon said, "You need to do your job properly. Otherwise, why are we paying you? If you disturb us again, I'll definitely file a complaint."

Simon nodded and casually glanced up, meeting my eyes.

He subtly nodded at me, and I felt relieved knowing he had left safely.

I decided to take a nap in my room until Shirley came back in the evening and brought me the prepared medicine.

Looking at the bowl of medicine she handed me, I thought Shirley and Brandon probably didn't know that it had been replaced with a life-saving antidote instead of the harmful poison.

Shirley's face hadn't shown any results from her hospital visit, and she looked very upset.

After I quickly drank the medicine, she left without saying a word.

I noticed that Shirley's facial swelling seemed worse than before.

The doctor's medicine was indeed effective. After drinking it, I felt much stronger than before.

If I continued like this, I might fully recover soon.

I was immersed in this joy when the children's cries brought me back to reality.

I realized I should take this time to investigate why the children cried whenever they saw me.

But Brandon was so cautious that he even locked the drawers, so the surveillance footage must be password-protected. To check the footage, I needed some special means.

Late at night, I called Simon.

After he delivered the medicine last time, I memorized his phone number.

When I called, Simon's voice sounded a bit sleepy.

"Hello? Who is this?"

"Sorry to bother you so late, but this is the only time I can call. I'm really sorry."

Realizing it was me, Simon cleared his throat, his voice inexplicably lazy. "It's okay, go ahead."

"I want to know if you can crack the surveillance password. I want to check the footage of the children's room. I suspect our nanny, Shirley, has done something to my kids."

Simon thought for a moment and then replied, "It's not difficult, but it requires some skills to crack. I'll get back to you in a week. Call me then."

For some reason, even though I had only met Simon a few times, I found him very reliable.

I thanked him excitedly and hung up the phone.

Back in bed, I stared at the ceiling, feeling completely different from before.

Previously, I felt isolated and helpless, thinking I could only lie in bed and wait to die.

But now, it seemed like every crisis had a solution, and everything was moving in a positive direction. Although it was just a small step, compared to being stuck in the mud before, I was already very satisfied.

After drinking the antidote, my spirits improved, and my complexion looked better than before.

So I started applying a layer of pale foundation on my face every day, making me look worse than before. I also took the opportunity to stop lying in bed all day and instead lay in the rocking chair in the yard with Nala, basking in the sun.

If Shirley and Brandon asked, I would just say I was too dizzy to sleep.

They both assumed my condition was worsening and didn't suspect a thing.

###chapter 16

It quickly reached the time Simon and I had agreed upon, and I called him right on time. He answered promptly.

"I got a friend to make you a universal program. Just plug it into Brandon's computer, and you can see anything you want."

I was stunned. I hadn't held out much hope; even if Simon couldn't help me today, I could accept it.

But who knew he would be so efficient, not only getting it done but doing it perfectly.

I hurriedly thanked him, "If it weren't for you, I really wouldn't know what to do. When I get out of here..."

He interrupted me before I could finish.

"We'll talk about the future later. I believe you can definitely escape Brandon's clutches."

I nodded heavily. I believed that too, and I would take the kids with me.

After Simon and I agreed on a time for him to deliver the item, I hung up the phone.

But I couldn't calm down for a long time. After hiding my phone, I went back to bed to rest up for tomorrow's handover.

Early the next morning, I got up and put on a weak-looking makeup. After drinking the medicine Shirley brought me, I lay down on the lounge chair in the yard.

I looked at the fence not far away, and my thoughts drifted away.

Simon said he would deliver the item through the fence. Fortunately, only Shirley was home today; Brandon had to go to work, so we shouldn't be discovered.

But I waited in the yard for a long time, and Brandon didn't leave the house in his suit.

I couldn't help but get anxious. When I went inside, I saw him in casual clothes, playing with the kids, with no intention of going to work.

I was anxious but couldn't show it. I gently asked, "Brandon, aren't you going to work today?"

Brandon looked at me and said meaningfully, "No, I'm staying home with you today."

A chill ran down my spine. If I weren't sure Brandon didn't know about Simon and me, I would have thought he was doing it on purpose.

I nodded and went back to the yard.

But I couldn't help but start to worry. Simon had already come once dressed as a plumber. If he came again, it would look suspicious, and Brandon would definitely be suspicious.

But I couldn't go back to warn him. Brandon could enter my room at any time, and my hidden phone might be taken away. Then I would be truly desperate.

I could only lie there and pray that Brandon wouldn't see Simon when he came.

But as the agreed time approached, Brandon suddenly moved a lounge chair next to mine and lay down, sighing.

"I didn't expect sunbathing here to feel so good. When we get old, I'll always sunbathe with you."

I knew Brandon loved to act, always maintaining his affectionate persona, but I was still amazed by his superb acting skills.

If I weren't already close to the truth, I might have been fooled by Brandon.

But what worried me more was that the time I had agreed with Simon was approaching, and Brandon chose this moment to come over. Did he know something?

But only Simon and I knew about our plan; no one would have told him.

No one heard me when I called that day, so how did he find out?

I glanced at Brandon. He had closed his eyes, seemingly ready to enjoy the sunshine.

Or was it just a coincidence?

As the antique clock in the house chimed, I realized the time had come. Brandon had cut off all my internet access, so this was the only way I could accurately know the time.

I quietly looked outside the fence, but there was no one there.

Did Simon forget?

Just as I was wondering, I heard a dog barking in the distance.

I looked in the direction of the sound and saw Simon walking over with a dog.

He wasn't wearing a fake mustache today; he was using his real appearance.

I was extremely nervous, afraid that Brandon would recognize him.

Simon walked past our yard without looking around, but the dog stopped and barked incessantly.

Simon frowned, "You bad dog, didn't I tell you not to bark at other people's houses?"

Brandon's attention was drawn, and I took the opportunity to walk over and wave, "Is this your dog? What's its name?"

Simon replied, "His name is Buddy. He's a stray dog I picked up."

"He's so cute. Can I pet him?"

Simon and I tried to act like strangers, talking naturally.

Just as I was about to reach out, Brandon called me from behind.

"Caroline, don't touch it. You're not well. Be careful not to get sick."

I turned back, unhappy, "It's someone else's pet. What's the problem? You know I love cats and dogs. Can't I even pet one?"

I rarely got angry, and Brandon was taken aback, "I'm just thinking of you. Fine, pet it if you want, but remember to wash your hands afterward."

I nodded and reached out to touch the dog, but Simon grabbed my hand and slipped something into it.

I felt it was a cold, USB-like object.

"Ma'am, wait. My dog bites. You better not touch it."

Simon quickly let go of my hand, so fast I didn't have time to react.

When I came to my senses, I clutched the item in my hand and casually put my hand in my pocket.

"If I can't pet it, then forget it."

I lay back down in my original spot.

My heart was racing. I couldn't believe I had successfully gotten the item right next to Brandon.

Of course, I knew it was all thanks to Simon. His reaction was so quick that most people wouldn't have noticed our hands touching.

I let out a long breath, a smile creeping onto my face.

But then Brandon suddenly asked, "You seem very happy?"

I quickly wiped the smile off my face and coughed lightly, "It's because you're with me. If you could spend more time with me, I'd be very happy."

Who can't lie? Let's see who can act better.

Brandon seemed surprised by my response, "Alright, I'll spend more time with you, as long as you don't find me annoying."

I nodded, pretending to listen to him, but my mind was on the USB in my hand.

I clutched it tightly in my pocket, afraid it would suddenly disappear.

Now that I had it, the next step was to find an opportunity to go to Brandon's study again.

###chapter 17

In the coming days, I would be waiting for an opportunity like the last time.

But Brandon seemed to have changed his personality recently, going to and from work on time and regularly, and sitting in the study as soon as he got home.

Helplessly, I could only call Kathy late at night to discuss what to do.

Kathy suddenly thought of something: "How about this, I find someone to pretend to cooperate with Brandon and trick him into going out of town?"

I was stunned. Yeah, why didn't I think of that?

The more I thought about it, the more I felt it was a good idea, and Brandon would definitely not miss such an opportunity. He would definitely go.

"Good idea, let's do it!"

Within a few days, I saw Brandon's expression getting happier and happier, as if something good had happened.

I deliberately asked, "Brandon, why have you been so happy these days?"

Brandon's face was full of pride: "A project came to me on its own, such a good thing happened to me."

I immediately understood that Brandon had fallen into Kathy's trap, and quite deeply.

Until one night, I suddenly heard a commotion in the living room.

I went out to see Shirley packing Brandon's luggage, while Brandon was on the phone wearing a coat.

"Okay, I'm coming over now. I've already asked my assistant to buy the plane ticket."

After hanging up the phone, he took the luggage Shirley had packed for him and whispered a few words.

I didn't need to listen to know that he must have told Shirley to keep an eye on me.

When he was about to leave, he happened to meet my gaze.

Maybe he was afraid of losing the project he was about to get, so he didn't act like my affectionate husband as he did before.

Instead, he simply said, "I'm going to the neighboring city for a bid, I'll be back in two or three days."

I nodded and told him to be careful on the way.

It wasn't until I saw Brandon get in the car and drive away that I felt relieved.

I was really afraid he would suddenly come back like before, so I had to be as cautious as possible.

In the middle of the night, after Shirley had fallen asleep, I could finally go to Brandon's study openly this time.

But as soon as I reached the hallway, I suddenly realized there were surveillance cameras Brandon had set up specifically to monitor me.

I looked around, ran to the basement, and pulled the circuit breaker, plunging the entire house into darkness.

I took out my phone and used it as a flashlight to go to the study.

Fortunately, the study door wasn't locked, maybe Brandon thought the cameras were enough.

I opened the door and the night view outside the window came in.

But I suddenly realized that if I pulled the circuit breaker, the computer wouldn't start either.

For a moment, I was stuck in a dead end.

Suddenly, I thought of Brett, who had just returned from boarding school today and was sleeping soundly.

I woke Brett up apologetically and said, "Mommy needs to do something important later, can you stay in the basement and pull the circuit breaker for me?"

Brett blinked, his little face still sleepy, but he nodded.

I hugged him with some heartache and led him to the basement: "Look at your watch, can you push the circuit breaker up in five minutes? Then pull it down again after thirty minutes."

"You mustn't fall asleep, okay?"

Brett nodded, looking serious as he started timing.

I took the opportunity to sneak into the study, and sure enough, Brett pulled up the circuit breaker after five minutes.

All the appliances came back to life, buzzing.

I turned on the computer, and sure enough, Brandon's computer was password-protected.

I decisively inserted the USB drive Simon gave me, and as the program infiltrated, it quickly cracked the password and brought me to his computer's desktop.

I took a deep breath and opened the surveillance software, switching to the children's room.

The kids had started distancing themselves from me in the past six months, and I didn't know why. They would cry whenever they saw me.

So I was sure Shirley and Brandon had done something in the past six months.

I started fast-forwarding through the past six months of surveillance, skipping when no one was there.

Until one unusual day, I saw Shirley pointing at my photo on a tablet, then taking out a needle and pricking the two kids.

I couldn't hold back my anger anymore, clenching my fists as I continued watching.

For a long time, it was the same. Whenever they saw my photo or saw me, Shirley would reflexively prick them with a needle.

Over time, the kids would start crying as soon as they saw me!

I was trembling with anger. I had wondered why I heard the kids crying every day. I thought they were just young and didn't understand, but now I see it was Shirley doing it on purpose!

No wonder she wouldn't let me see the kids, probably afraid I'd see the needle marks on them!

I wanted to go downstairs and kill Shirley right then, but I knew it wasn't the right time.

I copied the surveillance footage as evidence and was about to exit the computer when I saw a small room on the surveillance screen.

I was stunned and enlarged the view of that room.

I could confirm this surveillance was connected to our house, but I had never seen this small room before.

I opened the surveillance for that small room and found that footage from three months ago had been deleted, definitely by Brandon.

But what had happened in there?

I decided to look for evidence on his computer.

Brandon's computer was fairly clean, mostly company data and documents. I scanned through it quickly, finding nothing noteworthy.

Could it be that there were no secrets on his computer?

Then what had happened in that small room?

I was about to give up when I accidentally clicked into a folder named "Employee Health Surveys."

Inside were videos labeled with dates.

I realized I had found the right place.

I scrolled down, and the earliest date was from when Brandon and I had just gotten married.

I didn't know why my heart was racing, nervously clicking on a video, and the footage made me collapse.

The video quality from ten years ago wasn't great, but I saw Brandon set up a camera and then turn to a woman.

And this was the surveillance footage from the deleted small room.

He looked so young back then, but he turned and took a whip from the wall, striking the woman.

The following footage was even more unbearable.

I had thought Brandon's feelings for me had faded over the years, which was why he acted this way.

But who knew, from the beginning of our marriage, he had been finding women to play these games, sometimes even one a day at the peak.

And I had no idea. My husband Brandon was a gentleman in public but a beast in private!

All those beautiful memories I had were fake!

Brandon, you are such a good actor. You started acting ten years ago!

I will make you lose everything you have now! I will!

###chapter 18

After Brett pulled the switch and I left, I felt so disgusted with this house that I couldn't stay any longer.

I had only one thought in my mind: I must get both of them out of my house, definitely!

Back in my room, I couldn't calm down for a long time.

I recalled Brandon's past; he had disguised himself so well, and I hadn't noticed at all.

Thinking of what my parents had said back then, I felt a wave of regret.

The next morning, I got up early and took my medicine, only to find that Brett hadn't gotten up yet.

He usually got up at this time every day, but today he was still sound asleep and couldn't be woken up. This state was very similar to when I was in a deep sleep, which made me nervous.

I pushed Brett: "Brett, what's wrong? Wake up."

But he remained motionless, still deeply asleep.

I went downstairs to find Shirley, who was busy with her breakfast in the kitchen. She was cooking a lot of precious ingredients, and I hadn't noticed before that she ate such a lavish breakfast.

"Shirley, Brett hasn't woken up yet."

Shirley's expression was indifferent: "Maybe he hasn't fully woken up yet. Let him sleep a bit more, what's the harm?"

Shirley's cold attitude made me suddenly furious.

"What do you mean, what's the harm? Are you the nanny, or am I the nanny? My son Brett is still sleeping, and instead of checking on him, you're here having breakfast. Do you believe I'll fire you and let you go home to eat?"

Shirley was stunned, her eyes filled with unwillingness, but she agreed: "I'll go check on him now."

Saying that, she put down her things and went to Brett's room.

I had a gut feeling that Shirley's reaction was off. I followed her and watched as she casually called out to Brett a couple of times, then turned to me: "Mrs. Jordan, Brett is really just sleeping."

I frowned, my gaze sweeping around Brett's room.

Sure enough, when I looked at the table, Shirley's face showed a guilty expression.

I nodded: "You can go now."

Shirley turned to leave, but then she suddenly walked to the table I had just looked at, picked up a cup, and explained: "Mrs. Jordan, this cup is dirty. I'll take it out to wash."

"Wait."

I stopped her and stepped forward to take the cup. But Shirley was unwilling to give it to me, looking extremely guilty.

"Mrs. Jordan, what do you want with this dirty cup?"

"I told you to give it to me, didn't you hear?"

But Shirley refused to let go. I was sure she had done something to the cup. Just as I was about to grab it, she smashed the cup.

"Mrs. Jordan, it was just a dirty cup. I'll clean it up."

The cup shattered on the ground, and whatever was in it was now unrecognizable.

I watched as she bent down, cleaned up the pieces, and threw them in the trash.

At that moment, Brett suddenly called out to me: "Mom, why are you in my room?"

I didn't have time to think about it and quickly went to Brett's side.

"Brett, how are you? Why did you sleep for so long?"

Brett shook his head: "I woke up this morning and asked Shirley to make me breakfast. She gave me a glass of milk, and then I slept until now."

I was stunned, thinking of the lavish breakfast Shirley had made for herself, and anger surged within me.

But now that the cup was broken, I had no way to hold her accountable.

Brett rested his head on my shoulder: "Mom, I'm still sleepy. I'll sleep a bit more."

Saying that, he quickly fell asleep again.

I went out to find the medicine box, and sure enough, there were sleeping pills inside. Brandon used to take them to help him sleep when he had insomnia.

The packaging said the daily limit was one pill per person. I poured three pills into Shirley's cup.

After finishing her breakfast, Shirley drank it without any hesitation.

Then she played with the kids and watched TV, soon falling asleep.

I took the kids back to their room and looked at the deeply sleeping Shirley. I went up and slapped her hard.

"You better not let me find out that Brett's condition has anything to do with you, or I will definitely kill you."

Saying that, I called Kathy.

On the phone, I detailed Brett's unusual behavior in the morning and Shirley's unnatural reaction.

Kathy was furious: "That bitch Shirley must have done something to Brett. Otherwise, he wouldn't be like this. Wait for me, I'll come get you now."

In less than half an hour, Kathy arrived.

After I got in the car with Brett, he looked at me: "Mom, where are we going?"

I patiently patted his head: "Mom is taking you to the hospital. Don't worry, everything will be fine."

Hearing this, Brett fell asleep again.

When we arrived at the hospital, Kathy and I carried Brett to the emergency room.

The doctor didn't ignore us. He checked Brett's eyes and mouth and decided to do a blood test.

Kathy and I waited in the lab area for the results.

Soon, the doctor came out with Brett's test results, pointing at the indicators: "Who are the parents of this child? How can you be so irresponsible?"

"The child's blood has an overdose of sleeping pills. This can affect his brain function. No matter how noisy the child is, you can't do this!"

I stood up, grabbing the test results.

Kathy was furious: "That bitch Shirley! How could she do this to Brett? I will definitely kill her!"

I looked at the doctor: "Is there anything we can do now?"

The doctor, with a bad attitude, said: "He needs to have his stomach pumped and then dilute the drug in his blood."

I nodded and went to pay the bill.

I didn't expect the money I took from the study to come in handy here.

Shirley had done this just because she didn't want to make breakfast for Brett in the morning.

I would never let her get away with this.

Thinking back, Shirley had never been close to Brett. Instead, she was close to the newborn twins who didn't know anything, just because Brett always knew I was his mother.

And the boy-girl twins were easier to fool.

Now it seemed that Brandon's decision to send Brett to boarding school was correct. Otherwise, who knows what kind of harm Shirley would have done to him at home?

And this grudge, I would repay a hundredfold.

Brett was having his stomach pumped in the hospital room, and I didn't dare to go in. Kathy was inside, taking care of Brett for me.

Hearing his heart-wrenching cries, my heart broke.

Every time he called out "Mom," my hatred for Shirley deepened.

After the stomach pumping and injections, it was already evening. Kathy took Brett and me back home.

I knew Shirley must have woken up by now, and the villa was brightly lit.

I walked in to see Brandon standing in the living room, his back radiating anger.

In front of him, Shirley knelt with disheveled hair, a bright red handprint on her face.

###chapter 19

Shirley looked at me and quickly pointed at me, saying, "Mr. Brandon Jordan, Mrs. Jordan is back, and she brought Mr. Brett Jordan!"

Brandon then turned to look at me, his tone sinister, "Where have you been?"

I showed no expression and gently placed Brett on the sofa, "What do you mean by that? Do I have to report to you wherever I go? Or have you already put me under house arrest, not allowing me to leave the house?"

Brandon was taken aback, seemingly realizing his bad mood, and quickly said, "I'm just worried about you. You know your illness hasn't healed yet. If you go out recklessly, it might get worse, and you took Brett with you, which makes me even more worried."

Shirley also complained indignantly, "That's right, Mrs. Jordan, you should have told me where you were going. Otherwise, if Mr. Jordan blames me, what should I say?"

I sneered and took out the test report, handing it to Brandon.

"Didn't you ask where I went? I went to the hospital."

There was a moment of obvious tension in Brandon's eyes, "What did you go to the hospital for?"

But when he saw Brett's name on the test report, he immediately relaxed.

"You took Brett to the hospital? What did the test show?"

He couldn't understand the professional report, but Shirley immediately understood and quickly stepped forward to grab the test report.

"Mr. Jordan, let me see it. After all, I've been taking care of Brett, and I'm also anxious."

But I was prepared and pulled the test report away first, "Today, the doctor found sleeping pills in Brett's body."

As soon as I said this, the room fell silent.

"Sleeping pills?"

After a long while, Brandon asked in disbelief, "How could Brett take sleeping pills?"

He glanced at Shirley, who was now pale with fear and quickly shook her head.

I smirked, "Then ask Shirley. Didn't she say she's been taking care of Brett?"

"If I hadn't noticed Brett sleeping all the time this morning, the amount of sleeping pills would have already affected his brain."

Although Brandon was unfaithful to me, he was still good to his children, especially since Brett was his first child.

He turned angrily to Shirley, "Tell me, what the hell is going on?"

Shirley trembled and knelt on the ground, shaking her head repeatedly.

"Mr. Jordan, I really don't know. Maybe Mrs. Jordan heard wrong. Maybe it's not sleeping pills?"

I glared at Shirley, "What, do you think I'm deaf?"

"After I noticed something was wrong with Brett, I wanted to call you to go to the hospital with me. What were you doing? You were sleeping!"

"I had no choice but to take Brett myself."

After hearing what I said, Brandon stepped forward and slapped Shirley hard on the face.

"Tell me, what the hell is going on?"

Shirley looked frantically at the medicine box under the coffee table, "Maybe the medicine box was too low, and Brett didn't notice and secretly took a few. It really wasn't me who gave him the medicine, really."

But her defense was almost pale, and any normal person could see the problem.

Brandon was nearly furious, "Get back to your room, and you won't get paid for the next six months!"

Shirley didn't dare to say anything and quickly shrank back to her room.

I looked coldly at Brandon. Wasn't he doing this to calm my anger? Otherwise, wouldn't it be the best solution to fire Shirley directly?

"Do you believe Shirley's claim that Brett took the sleeping pills himself?"

Brandon's eyes dodged, "It's very possible. Shirley is taking care of three children alone, so there must be some oversight. Besides, Brett is fine, right?"

"I've already punished her. When you can forgive someone, try to forgive them."

I never expected to hear such words from Brandon's mouth. Doesn't he find it ironic?

Did he think of this when he and Shirley drugged me, almost causing my death?

"Why don't you just fire her?"

Seeing that I was really angry, Brandon quickly came forward and put his arm around my shoulder, "It's because the boy-girl twins are still young, and she's been taking care of them. The kids are used to her. If we change someone, they'll have to adapt for a long time. Besides, she didn't do it on purpose today."

"Why does it have to be her? Can't I do it myself?"

Brandon shook his head, his voice gentle, "Caroline, you're not in good health. I'm worried you won't be able to handle it. Anyway, when the kids grow up, I'll get rid of Shirley, okay?"

He helped me sit on the sofa. His voice was gentle and pleasant, but I felt like a venomous snake was coiled in front of me, making me nauseous.

The funny thing is, I just thought Brandon, at least, didn't wrong the kids, but now he's covering for Shirley, who almost killed Brett.

He's not only unfit to be my husband but also unfit to be Brett's father.

I didn't say anything, and Brandon continued.

"Caroline, you must tell me when you go out in the future. You're not in good health now, and I'm really worried when you're out for so long."

Looking at his hypocritical appearance, I really wanted to know what he was like under the mask.

"Alright, when I took Brett to the hospital today, I scheduled a full-body checkup for three days later. You can accompany me then."

Brandon's face stiffened, "Why did you schedule a full-body checkup?"

"Of course, to see how my body is doing now. You never tell me, so can't I check it myself?"

Brandon's smile seemed forced, "I didn't want you to worry. Alright, if you want to go, I'll accompany you. Which hospital?"

I'd be a fool to tell him. Of course, I wouldn't let him do anything.

"You'll know then. I'm tired from taking care of Brett all day and want to rest now."

"Shirley's matter won't happen again. If it happens a second time, I won't keep her."

Brandon nodded, but his face turned gloomy the moment I turned around.

I returned to my room, still unable to calm down.

But because I was really tired today, I quickly fell asleep at night.

Until midnight, I was awakened by a woman's cry of pain.

I was startled, opened the door, and listened to the sound, confirming it was coming from Shirley.

The sound was coming from her room. I went downstairs and walked to her room.

The door wasn't closed, so I gently pushed it open a crack and heard Shirley's painful wails.

"Mr. Brandon, I'm sorry. I won't dare to do it again."

"If it weren't for you, would Caroline have suddenly decided to get a checkup? Do you know you ruined my plan?"

"I warn you, don't play any tricks. Today's matter of you drugging Brett is over. If it happens again, it won't be just a whip on you."

I felt a chill down my spine. So Brandon knew everything was done by Shirley, but he still chose to ignore it. In his heart, maybe even Brett wasn't important.

###chapter 20

I was so angry that I wanted to rush in and catch those two bastards in the act, but I knew it wasn't the right time yet.

The sounds inside changed again and again, and finally turned into Shirley's moans and Brandon's low growls.

I immediately realized what was happening inside, felt disgusted and nauseous, and left the place right away.

That night, I had a nightmare, my mind filled with images of Brandon and Shirley's affair, making it impossible for me to sleep well.

In the morning, Shirley brought out breakfast with a submissive look, but the charm in her eyes couldn't hide what had happened last night.

And Brandon's face showed satisfaction, with a smile at the corner of his mouth.

All of this made me so angry that I couldn't sit still.

I put down my bowl and turned to leave, afraid I might vomit at the table.

I asked Brett for a week's leave so he could stay home and recover.

And after what happened last night, Shirley definitely wouldn't dare to harm Brett again.

After breakfast, I went straight to Brandon's study.

When he saw me, he quickly turned off his computer with a wary look, then smiled.

"Caroline, why are you here all of a sudden?"

I pretended not to notice him turning off the computer and said, "Didn't you say yesterday that Shirley couldn't handle taking care of three kids alone? I'm planning to hire another nanny so that Brett won't have to go through something like this again."

Brandon frowned; of course, he didn't want another person in the house, as he didn't want his secrets to be discovered.

"Is that necessary?"

"Aren't you being too serious? Shirley just slipped up once, and usually, Brett goes to school. Why are you making a fuss?"

He looked a bit impatient, finally dropping his pretense.

I sneered, "Brandon, what do you mean? Do you think what happened to Brett this time was just a coincidence?"

"I guess you haven't forgotten what Shirley was doing when you came back from your business trip yesterday. She was sleeping. How can I trust her with the young boy-girl twins?"

"Or are you reluctant to let Shirley go? If that's the case, you can tell me directly, and I'll give her my place."

Brandon was stunned, his expression softened, and he helped me sit in his office chair. "That's not what I meant. I was also very angry about what happened to Brett yesterday, but being angry doesn't solve anything. Besides, we're used to Shirley's care. Wouldn't it be strange to have another person in the house?"

If I didn't know he had slept with Shirley last night, I might have believed his lies.

"I don't find it strange. As long as my children are safe, I can handle anything."

Brandon looked a bit helpless. "Do you really want to hire another nanny?"

"If not, I'll take care of the boy-girl twins myself. I can't leave them with Shirley anymore."

"What about your health?"

I chuckled, "If you're worried about my health, then hiring another nanny would solve the problem."

As soon as I said that, Brandon fell silent. "Fine, if you want to take care of the kids, you can. Just don't push yourself too hard. If you need anything, just tell Shirley. I'll talk to her now."

Only then did I nod.

This was the real reason I came here.

The kids are now at an age where they remember things, and I don't want them to call Shirley "mom" in the future.

Brandon took me downstairs, and Shirley was tidying up in the kitchen.

He said, "From now on, you don't need to worry about the boy-girl twins. Just take care of the housework."

Shirley was stunned and instinctively objected, "That's not possible. The boy-girl twins can't do without me."

I sneered, "How can they not do without you? Who do you think you are? Their real mom? Or do you want to replace me?"

At these words, both Shirley and Brandon's faces showed a strange expression.

But Shirley quickly stepped forward, "Mrs. Jordan, what about the kids? They're still so young and need care."

"I can handle it. Didn't you say yesterday that you couldn't manage three kids alone? From now on, I'll take care of the boy-girl twins. You just need to do your job as a nanny."

I deliberately emphasized the word "nanny" to remind Shirley of her place.

Sure enough, Shirley's eyes were filled with resentment. "With your poor health, can you really take care of the kids? You might be even more negligent than I am."

Brandon frowned, "Shirley, watch your mouth."

Shirley looked at Brandon with a grievance, "Anyway, Mrs. Jordan, if you really care about the kids, let me take care of them."

"You? Didn't you take care of Brett and send him to the hospital?"

"That was just an accident, and it was only once."

Her indifferent attitude made me want to tear her face apart.

I stepped forward and slapped her hard. Shirley held her face in disbelief and looked at Brandon.

Brandon frowned and pulled me back, "What are you doing? Can't you talk it out?"

I glared at Brandon, "Didn't you hear her indifferent tone? What do you mean 'only once'? The boy-girl twins are so young, they can't handle even one incident."

"I don't want Shirley as a nanny anymore. Find another one!"

With that, I went upstairs without looking at their reactions.

I sat in my room for a while until I heard a knock on the door.

Shirley came in with her head down, clearly having been scolded by Brandon.

She said, "Mrs. Jordan, I apologize. I didn't mean it that way. I just love the kids so much that I misspoke in a moment of anxiety."

"From now on, you take care of the kids, and I'll just do the housework. Please don't kick me out."

Looking at her with her head down, I guessed her eyes were filled with curses for me.

I said, "Raise your head!"

She reluctantly raised her head, her eyes full of unwillingness that she couldn't express.

"That's right. Don't forget, Shirley, you're just a nanny. Do you think you can become Mrs. Jordan? Dream on."

Shirley's face turned ugly, but she gritted her teeth and said nothing.

"Alright, go on. Just do your job as a nanny and stop meddling in our family's affairs. Otherwise, there are plenty of nannies out there."

Shirley left angrily, and after a while, Brandon came over.

"Why are you so angry over such a small matter?"

I sneered, "Do you think the kids' safety is a small matter?"

Brandon paused, "I just think you're being too harsh on Shirley. Weren't you two getting along well before?"

He had the nerve to say that. The moment he and Shirley conspired to drug me, they became my enemies.

"You're overthinking it. She's just a nanny. Why would I have any feelings for her?"

Looking at Brandon's face, I deliberately said, "Let me tell you, even if you find a mistress in the future, it has to be someone I approve of. If you find someone like Shirley, I won't respect you."

###chapter 21

Brandon's face darkened, clearly upset by my scolding, but he still forced himself to comfort me.

"What are you talking about? How could I have a mistress? I only love you, there's no one else in my heart."

I sneered. If this was his idea of love, then his love was really cheap.

I lay on the bed and told him to leave, "I'm tired, I need to sleep for a while. If you have nothing else, just go."

Brandon stood up and walked out with a gloomy face.

Who told Brandon to be so indiscriminate in finding a mistress? He deserved to be scolded.

Just then, I suddenly felt my phone vibrating under the pillow.

These days, Brandon had clearly relaxed his guard against me, so I kept my phone nearby in case I needed to contact Kathy and the others.

I locked the door and picked it up. Sure enough, it was a call from Kathy.

I knew she wouldn't call me during the day unless it was something important, so I quickly answered.

"Caroline, I had Simon investigate the backgrounds of Brandon and Shirley, and now we have the results."

I nodded and walked to the bathroom to let her speak.

Kathy told me the results of Simon's investigation.

It turned out that Shirley's real name wasn't Shirley, but Bertha Ross. After she got out, she changed her name. She used to work in a restaurant and, relying on her looks, had ambiguous relationships with all the male waiters and the boss.

But they couldn't hide these relationships. Shirley's seduction of the boss was soon discovered by the other male waiters, who secretly told the boss's wife.

The boss's wife was furious and came over to give Shirley a good beating, almost stripping her naked and posting photos online.

Later, the restaurant boss gave Shirley some money, and she had plastic surgery and changed her name before coming to our city, thinking she could use her looks to hook up with a rich second-generation heir.

But her looks weren't exceptionally beautiful, just pretty, so no rich heirs were interested in her.

Shirley faced setbacks everywhere and decided to find a middle-aged boss to seduce. So she became a nanny, and by luck, she met Brandon, who was naturally not picky and would take any woman who threw herself at him.

I listened as she continued, "This Brandon is even more impressive. How did he tell you about his past?"

When I met Brandon, he was a fitness coach. Although he hadn't had much education, he was very gentle.

I ended up with him because I bought fitness courses from him.

Kathy sneered, "He lied to you. Brandon used to be a male escort, and the kind with no bottom line. As long as he was paid, he would sleep with anyone."

Later, Brandon was kept by a female boss, and from then on, he lived off women's money.

After being with the female boss for a long time, she lost interest in him. When she no longer wanted him, he had to find a new target.

"And then that bastard Brandon set his sights on you. After all, you're young and beautiful, much better than those other women."

"Brandon only started working as a coach at that gym a week before you went there. That bastard was there to deceive you."

I thought I would be angry when I heard this, but surprisingly, I felt nothing, as if I were listening to someone else's story.

Maybe ever since I discovered Brandon's true nature, nothing surprised me anymore. I just felt disgusted and regretful.

Regretful that so many years of my marriage had been wasted, and even more regretful that I had given my three children a father like Brandon.

Kathy noticed my silence and cautiously asked, "Caroline, are you too angry to speak?"

I shook my head and chuckled, "Honestly, I'm not surprised at all by Brandon's past. He's just that kind of bastard. I have no expectations of him, so there's no disappointment or anger."

Hearing this, Kathy was relieved.

"Don't worry, we'll make sure that bastard Brandon gets what he deserves."

Listening to her, I couldn't help but laugh.

That night, perhaps because I was angry during the day, he said he wanted to sleep with me.

I felt disgusted inside but couldn't refuse on the surface.

When he came over to hug me, I almost threw up. I quickly got up, "How about some milk before bed? You never liked drinking water."

I went out to get him some milk and put a few sleeping pills in it. Brandon didn't suspect a thing and drank it without hesitation.

Then he tried to do something to me, but I quickly refused, pointing to the kids nearby.

Since I stopped Shirley from taking care of the kids, I had brought the boy-girl twins to my room so I could look after them immediately.

Although they were still afraid of me, I had successfully put them to sleep.

"So what? Let them learn about sex education early, know how their parents made them."

I frowned. This bastard Brandon really didn't care about time or place when he was horny.

I prayed for the sleeping pills to take effect quickly and deliberately stalled until he fell asleep.

He snored loudly, completely at ease.

To make sure he was asleep, I called his name a few times.

"Brandon, Brandon."

He didn't respond. I said, "I want to go to your study to get something. Can you open the door for me?"

Brandon still didn't wake up. The study was where he kept his most important things. If he didn't wake up, he must be truly asleep.

His phone was right next to him. I took it without hesitation. Usually, Brandon's phone would lock when he saw me, so it definitely had a password.

The phone had a password. I tried unlocking it with Brandon's fingerprint, and he didn't react.

Once the phone was unlocked, I searched through it, trying to find something.

But his phone was excessively clean, like a conservative middle-aged man's.

This was completely out of character for him, and if that were the case, he wouldn't need to hide his phone.

There must be some hidden secrets in it.

Sure enough, I found a system-changing app on his phone. When I opened it, the phone immediately changed its appearance.

This must be what he usually looked at.

The phone's screen had several hookup apps. I didn't bother looking at them and directly opened WhatsApp.

His WhatsApp was a mess, with all kinds of people, but mostly women and groups discussing women, with particularly disgusting comments.

Until I found his chat with Moira.

Brandon was very cautious, deleting chat records from a few weeks ago, leaving only the recent ones.

Brandon had asked Moira to find someone named Reed Fields.

Moira didn't know him, but I did.

Reed was my mom Kelly's former student. Looking at the time, it was right when Brandon went to see Kelly that he asked Moira to find Reed. Did he discover something at our house?

###chapter 22

I kept this matter in mind and then went to look at other things.

However, most of the chat history in WhatsApp had been deleted by him, so there was nothing much to see.

I could only turn to his photo album. Besides some disgusting photos, I indeed found something useful.

I saw several large insurance policies, with Brandon as the beneficiary and me as the insured.

If I were to die, he would directly receive tens of millions of dollars in insurance money.

My hand holding the phone trembled uncontrollably. No wonder, no wonder Brandon drugged me.

But I suddenly realized something was wrong. Our company was still generating revenue, so he shouldn't be short of money. Could there be another reason?

Or is there a problem with our company?

I continued to scroll down and found naked photos of Shirley, with a tattoo on her back.

In the photo, she was kneeling on the ground, her back fully exposed, with the words "Brandon's slave" written on it.

Brandon only showed a wrist, wearing his usual watch, holding a whip.

I clicked on it in disgust, feeling like I had seen something dirty.

Continuing to search, I suddenly saw a mortgage contract.

I opened it and found out that he had mortgaged all our joint properties, getting a considerable amount of money.

But I was even more confused. If Brandon needed money, mortgaging the house would already be a huge sum. Why would he still use me to scam insurance money? What was the reason?

Although I knew Brandon was greedy, mortgaging the house indicated that things had reached a certain level of crisis. But he still chose to harm me for those millions of dollars.

This was extremely inconsistent with his character. What exactly happened?

There was nothing else on his phone. I switched the system back, deleted the access records, and placed it by Brandon's ear.

He was still sound asleep, seemingly unaware of what I had just seen.

I lay down with a belly full of questions, unable to figure it out even as I fell asleep.

The next morning, I was woken up by Brandon.

He asked, "Did you touch my phone?"

I knew I couldn't hide it from him, so I nodded.

"You were too tired and fell asleep directly, lying on your phone. I helped you move it."

Brandon nodded half-believingly and then asked me to get up, "Didn't you say you wanted me to accompany you to the hospital for a check-up today? Let's go."

I was stunned. He had been reluctant before, so why was he so eager now?

I got up and dressed. Last night, to prevent him from discovering that my health was gradually improving, I deliberately didn't remove my makeup. Now I went to the bathroom to touch up my haggard look and followed him out.

Brandon took me to the car and asked, "Where is the place you made the appointment for the check-up?"

I gave the name of the hospital but became more puzzled.

The driver directly entered the name of the place into the navigation system. I keenly noticed that this location had been entered once before, meaning Brandon had been there once.

I was momentarily surprised but then not too puzzled. After all, after I took Brett to see a doctor, Brandon might have gone to verify if I had really gone to the hospital. It seemed he must have done something with the doctor, as no one else knew.

Soon, the car took us to the hospital, and Brandon led me straight to the check-up center.

There, I clearly saw Brandon and the doctor exchange a glance before sending me in.

But I felt much more relaxed. Since I knew they were faking it, this could just cover up the fact that my health had improved, which suited me perfectly.

So I let them do as they pleased.

After the check-up, the report would take a few days to come out.

Brandon didn't rush to take me home but said, "I haven't taken you shopping for a long time. You can buy whatever you want."

I couldn't tell if he had another plot or was just trying to act like a good man.

But I hadn't walked on the street like this for a long time. Even with Brandon by my side, I felt much better.

Suddenly, I saw Kathy and Simon walking towards me side by side. Simon winked at me, seemingly wanting to say something.

Brandon seemed to have seen them too. Kathy came up and took my hand, "Caroline, why are you out today?"

I looked at Brandon, "Brandon brought me for a check-up. Who is this beside you?"

Brandon knew all my social circles, so I had to act like I didn't know Simon.

"My cousin, you don't know him."

"Since you brought Caroline out, can you let her shop with us for a while?"

Brandon refused without thinking, "Of course not. Caroline is still very weak and can only stay for a while."

I suddenly pointed to the nearby café, "Shall we sit for a while? I haven't been out for a long time and want to stay outside a bit longer."

Brandon hesitated but then nodded.

We all went to the café and sat down. Under the table, Kathy gently touched my foot.

This meant she had something to say, but Brandon remained unmoved.

I stood up, "I need to go to the restroom. Do you know where it is?"

When Brandon was about to stand up, Simon got up, "I've been here before. I'll take you."

When Brandon was about to follow, Kathy said, "You don't have to, right? Are you going to follow Caroline into the ladies' room? Who are you guarding against?"

Her words directly exposed Brandon's thoughts, and he sat down awkwardly.

After Simon took me to the restroom, I was about to speak when I saw someone not far away.

Simon noticed my strange look and quickly looked over, mouthing, "Do you know her?"

I nodded. Of course, I knew her because she was Brandon's sister, Renee Jordan.

But why was she here?

It couldn't be a coincidence that we came to the same café, right? That would be too much of a coincidence.

I knew hiding wasn't a solution, and Renee's presence was a question mark. So I walked over and greeted her.

Renee just glanced at me and then focused on Simon, her eyes suddenly lighting up.

"Who are you?"

"This is my good friend Kathy's cousin, Simon. Renee, Brandon is with us. Do you want to join us?"

On the way back, Renee walked in front, and Simon walked beside me. He suddenly asked, "Why do I feel something is off about her?"

I nodded. It was said that people who use drugs smell different from ordinary people, "Yes, she uses drugs."

###chapter 23

Simon nodded knowingly, it seemed he already knew and was just confirming with me.

The three of us returned to our seats, and Brandon looked at his sister Renee without a hint of surprise in his eyes, making it clear that they had already planned this.

The two exchanged a subtle glance and then took their seats.

Brandon suddenly looked at Simon: "I feel like I've seen you before, have we met somewhere?"

His words made both Kathy and me nervous. Of course, Brandon had seen Simon before, and Simon had even been here more than once.

Unexpectedly, Renee joined in the fun, squinting her eyes as she scrutinized Simon: "Now that you mention it, he does look familiar, like my future husband."

Renee's words left us all stunned, and Simon choked on his drink.

He waved his hand: "Ms. Jordan, you're joking."

Renee's interruption made Brandon give up staring at Simon, and we all relaxed.

After finishing our coffee, I remembered that Simon and I had something to discuss, and coincidentally, Brandon and Renee had both left for the restroom. I looked at Simon.

He looked at me seriously and said, "Your family used to have an old house in the Sky Dome Mountain area, right?"

I nodded, surprised that he had found out about this, as I hadn't been back there in almost ten years.

Simon nodded and continued, "As far as I know, that area is about to undergo urban renewal, and your family's house is worth at least fifty million dollars. Brandon's recent visit there was probably because of this."

I was stunned, feeling a buzzing in my ears.

So, Brandon had this in mind. No wonder he went to Kelly's place for no reason.

But I didn't dare call Kelly now. If she knew about my situation, she would definitely come over, which would not only alert Brandon but also lead to unpredictable consequences from him.

But I was genuinely worried about Kelly, afraid that she might be deceived by Brandon.

Seeing my panic, Kathy stepped forward and held my hand: "Caroline, don't worry. I'll go to Kelly's place tomorrow and find out what's going on. Don't worry, I won't expose anything."

Hearing this, I was moved to tears.

I never expected to have such a good friend like Kathy in my life.

"Thank you, Kathy, and thank you, Simon. What would I do without you? Maybe by now I would have already..."

I didn't finish my sentence, but everyone knew what I meant.

Kathy frowned: "I don't like hearing you say that. If I were in your situation, wouldn't you help me?"

I nodded vigorously, the answer was definitely yes.

Kathy and I had been friends for over a decade, and she was like family to me.

Just then, Brandon and Renee returned. They seemed to have conspired about something. Seeing Kathy and me holding hands and my tearful appearance, Brandon frowned.

"Caroline, what's wrong?"

I didn't speak, but Kathy did: "Nothing, Caroline was just saying how good you are to her, and she got emotional. I was comforting her."

Brandon immediately understood and put his arm around my shoulder: "Caroline, why are you so emotional? Aren't we husband and wife? This is what I should do."

The three of us exchanged glances, it seemed Brandon didn't catch Kathy's sarcasm at all.

After finishing our coffee, the three of us prepared to leave. Renee suddenly called out to Simon: "Wait, let's add each other on WhatsApp?"

Simon showed a flash of disgust in his eyes but nodded: "Sure."

The five of us went our separate ways, and Brandon and I got into the driver's car to go home.

On the way back, I teased Brandon about Renee's behavior: "Do you think Renee has a crush on Kathy's cousin Simon?"

Brandon frowned instinctively at the mention: "She's always like that, inappropriate. I'll apologize to Kathy later."

I nodded and then asked, "Did you invite Renee? Otherwise, how did we just happen to meet her here? I haven't seen her in a long time."

His eyes flickered evasively, and he nodded randomly: "Coincidence, I haven't contacted her in a while either."

I keenly sensed that Brandon was lying. When I checked his phone, I saw his chat with Renee. Although there were no messages, the chat box was still there, indicating they had contacted each other recently.

I was sure they were up to something behind my back, and I needed to investigate further.

When we got home, Shirley was downstairs holding the kids. Seeing us return together, she looked displeased.

"Mrs. Jordan, you asked me to take care of the boy-girl twins, but you were gone for so long, and the kids were crying."

I smiled: "Thank you, please give me the kids, I'll take them to my room."

I reached out to take the kids, but Shirley hesitated.

"Give them to me, I need to go to my room, I'm tired."

Reluctantly, Shirley handed the kids to me, muttering: "Mrs. Jordan, if you're tired, just call me, don't push yourself."

Call you? So you can continue to scare my kids? Ridiculous!

I went back to my room, put the kids to sleep, and started thinking about Brandon's recent actions.

He took out a large insurance policy on me, was interested in my family's old house, all signs pointed to him needing money. But the company was still profitable, so why did he need so much money?

And Renee, her appearance today was definitely not a coincidence. Brandon always disliked Renee. Since we got married, Renee had caused trouble several times, always asking for money, even bothering my parents.

Even my parents knew Brandon had a sister who always asked for money, Renee.

This damaged Brandon's image with my parents, making him dislike Renee even more.

But now he actively contacted Renee, he must have a use for her.

I couldn't figure it out, and it kept me up until late at night.

The next morning, I got up to feed the kids and saw Brandon with a suitcase, ready to leave.

I chased after him and asked: "Brandon, are you going on a business trip?"

Brandon nodded: "Yes, I have some business to attend to. Take good care of the kids at home, and let Shirley handle anything you need."

I nodded, watching him leave.

The urgency in his eyes was real, clearly, something urgent had come up. But what could be so urgent?

I went back to my room and called Simon.

###chapter 24

Simon quickly answered, knowing that I wouldn't call him during the day unless it was important.

"What's up?"

"Brandon is on a business trip. Can you help me find out where he went? He seemed to be in a hurry."

Simon agreed and continued, "By the way, I have something else to tell you. Shirley has a younger sister named Paula Ross, who just graduated from college this year."

"And apparently, Shirley and Paula don't get along very well. But Shirley has been giving Paula living expenses because their parents would scold her if she didn't."

"Paula just graduated from college?"

I keenly picked up on this information. "Is she pretty?"

"She looks quite delicate, like a younger Shirley."

I raised an eyebrow. "Try to get in touch with Paula for me. If she can join this game, it would be interesting."

Simon understood my intention and agreed before hanging up.

I left the bathroom and opened the door, only to see Shirley standing sneakily at the door.

Seeing me come out, she looked suspicious. "Mrs. Jordan, who were you talking to?"

I shook the water off my hands. "Talking to who?"

Shirley pointed inside. "I clearly heard you talking inside, but I couldn't make out what you were saying."

My heart tightened at her words, but then I relaxed. It was good that Shirley didn't hear clearly.

I kept a straight face. "I was teaching the kids to say 'mom,' so they wouldn't mistake someone else for me."

Then I looked at Shirley. "Why are you standing at my door? Did Brandon ask you to spy on me? I'll call him right now to ask what he means by this."

Shirley quickly pressed down my hand, her tone flustered. "No, Mrs. Jordan, I just wanted to check if the kids were crying. I was worried you might not handle it well alone."

I sneered. "I raised Brett by myself. Why wouldn't I handle it well?"

"Shirley, do you think you're that important? That the whole world needs you?"

Shirley's face turned pale, and she looked at me with a hostile gaze.

"What are you looking at? Am I wrong?"

She gritted her teeth. "You're right, Mrs. Jordan. I just wanted to help you. I meant well. Don't be angry."

Then she brought a bowl of medicine. "Mrs. Jordan, you forgot to take your medicine this morning."

She probably thought it was poison, but she didn't know it was actually the antidote.

I drank it in one gulp. "Go do whatever you need to do. Isn't there other work in the house? Can you just squat at my door every day?"

Shirley didn't say anything and turned to leave.

I watched her back and sneered. She probably didn't know that I was about to reunite her with her family.

While Brandon was away, I had arranged everything.

I even found a new nanny, ready to replace Shirley.

I couldn't just sit and wait for them to erode me bit by bit. I had to start fighting back.

Soon, Brandon returned, with a hint of joy in his eyes.

It seemed he had resolved something. I approached him to inquire.

"Brandon, what did you go on a business trip for?"

Brandon vaguely replied, "I was working hard for the happiness of you and the kids."

I sneered inwardly. Who would believe that?

It was clear he didn't plan to tell me the truth. Fortunately, I had Simon investigating, so I wasn't in a hurry.

Since he liked to act, I would play along.

I held Brandon's arm. "Thank you, Brandon. With you here, the kids and I feel very secure."

At that moment, Shirley was mopping the floor in the living room. I saw her gripping the mop handle tightly.

The only regret was that I couldn't see her expression. She was probably gritting her teeth.

After the act with Brandon, I went back to my room.

Soon, I heard Shirley and Brandon talking downstairs.

I opened the door and heard Shirley's angry voice. "Is that medicine not working anymore? Why does she seem to be getting better? Do you not want her to die?"

Brandon, tired from the long flight, was naturally irritable.

"Why are you talking so much?"

Shirley's voice suddenly grew louder. "What do you mean I'm talking too much? Am I wrong? Are you feeling sorry and don't want..."

Before she could finish, Brandon stepped forward and slapped her hard. "Shut up. Do you want everyone to know about this?"

"Let me tell you, Shirley, you're just a nanny. It's your luck that I fancy you. I can have you or not. If you dare act like this again, get out. I have plenty of other choices for Mrs. Jordan."

Shirley suddenly fell silent and apologized after a while. "I'm sorry, Brandon. I just love you too much. I was wrong."

Brandon sneered. "You're lucky Caroline didn't hear you. Otherwise, you'd be out today."

Little did he know, I already knew.

It was a thrilling drama of mutual struggle. I was now looking forward to what would happen when Shirley's sister Paula arrived.

Thinking about it, I was even a bit excited.

In the evening, Simon called me.

"Hello, Simon. Did you find out anything?"

"Yes, Brandon went to Regal City to meet someone named Reed."

"Reed?"

I was stunned. Him again?

Simon seemed to sense something in my voice. "Do you know this Reed?"

I nodded. "Yes, Reed was my mom's student. My dad arranged for him to work in his company as a buyer. But Reed took money to buy substandard products and embezzled the rest."

"Later, my dad found out. It was my mom who pleaded for him, so he wasn't prosecuted, just fired. I haven't seen him in a long time."

"I only know that Brandon went to the hotel where Reed was staying. They talked for two days and left happily."

This matched Brandon's mood when he returned. But what could he be discussing with Reed?

I was increasingly puzzled. Brandon had many secrets waiting for me to uncover.

The more I thought about it, the more things seemed off. Reed, my insurance policy, the urban renewal of the old house-everything seemed connected to my family. What was Brandon planning? We still didn't know and could only respond as things unfolded.

I took a deep breath and thanked Simon. "Thank you, Simon. You've been a great help."

Simon wasn't modest. "No problem. Kathy paid for it. By the way, I gave your home address to Shirley's sister Paula. She didn't seem to know where Shirley worked."

###chapter 25

This is getting interesting. Paula is probably going to show up, and how will Shirley handle it then?

Sure enough, a few days later, on the day Brandon was off, the doorbell rang.

I had a premonition and looked over. Shirley went to open the door, and when she saw who it was, her voice lost control.

"What are you doing here? Didn't I already transfer the money to you?"

I immediately confirmed that it was Paula, while Brandon was focused on his phone, seemingly unaware of what was happening.

I got up and said loudly, "Who is it?"

I walked to the door, and Shirley tried to block the person behind her, but Paula stubbornly poked her head out from behind. "Is it Mrs. Jordan? I'm Shirley's sister, Paula."

My eyes lit up. "Really? Please come in, come in."

I looked at Shirley disapprovingly. "Seriously, Shirley, why didn't you invite Paula in? Are you trying to drive her away? Is our home some kind of unsightly place?"

Shirley gave an awkward smile, her face turning pale. "It's just that Paula hasn't seen much of the world, and I was afraid she'd be rude."

I quickly waved my hand. "No worries, your family is our family, the Jordan family. Come on in."

Paula came in willingly, looking around the house with amazement in her eyes.

"Mrs. Jordan, your house is really big."

Shirley pushed her discontentedly. "Can you stop acting like you've never seen the world?"

"Oh, I think Paula is quite cute. If she likes it here, she can stay for a few days."

I led Paula to the sofa, and it was clear that Brandon had noticed what was happening.

I had to admit, Simon had a good eye. Paula looked almost identical to Shirley, but she was younger and more refined.

No wonder Shirley didn't want Paula to come here; Paula indeed outshone her.

Brandon's gaze lingered on Paula's face for a long time, and he asked, "Are you Shirley's sister?"

Paula nodded shyly, her face blushing. "Yes, my name is Paula."

Shirley's face turned as dark as the bottom of a pot, her expression gloomy.

"What are you doing here? Mrs. Jordan, Mr. Jordan doesn't have time to listen to your introduction. If you have something to say, say it and leave."

Paula glanced at Shirley timidly. "Shirley, I'm here looking for a job. I've graduated, but it's hard to find a job this year, so I wanted to ask you..."

Before Paula could finish, Shirley interrupted, "No."

I glanced at her. "Why do you always stop Paula? We're in Skyview City, and there are plenty of job opportunities. It's a good thing Paula wants to come and gain experience."

Paula nodded. "I don't like the jobs back home. I just want to see the big city. Shirley, can you help me find a job? I'm out of money."

Shirley was annoyed and nodded. "I'll transfer you some money later. You can find a hotel and look for a job on your own. I can't help you."

Paula looked at Brandon for help. "Mr. Jordan, does your family need a maid? I can work with Shirley..."

Shirley interrupted Paula again. "Why do we need so many maids? You're just here to cause trouble. Leave now."

Brandon glanced at Shirley with displeasure. "Caroline is right. It's a good thing she wants to develop in the big city. Why do you keep driving Paula away?"

Shirley fell silent, looking at Brandon with resentment.

Unfortunately, Brandon was only staring at Paula. I found his lustful gaze disgusting.

I suppressed my disgust and asked, "What did you major in?"

Paula replied, "Literature."

I nodded and suddenly suggested, "Brandon, don't you need a secretary? Why not let Paula try? Shirley is so meticulous, Paula can't be much worse."

Before Brandon could speak, Shirley loudly objected, "That's definitely not possible. She'll surely cause trouble for Mr. Jordan. I don't agree."

Brandon snorted coldly. "It's not up to you to disagree."

He looked at Paula. "What do you think?"

Paula's eyes lit up, and she nodded repeatedly. "If that's possible, that would be great. I won't cause you any trouble."

"Trouble? Shirley has helped our family so much. It's only right to take care of you. Have you found a place to rent?"

Paula shook her head pitifully. "Not yet. I spent all my money on the way here."

Shirley was about to speak. "I'll give you..."

I quickly interrupted. "Then find a guest room and stay here. You can move out when you get your salary. You can stay close to Shirley. She hasn't been home for so many years; you must miss her."

Paula nodded. "Yes, I miss Shirley very much."

Shirley glared at her angrily and looked at Brandon, wanting to say more. "Mr. Jordan, this matter is not..."

But he ignored Shirley and got up, saying, "It's settled. Listen to Caroline. Paula, come to work with me tomorrow. I'll help you get familiar with the job."

Paula nodded repeatedly. "Thank you, Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mrs. Jordan."

Brandon went upstairs, and I excused myself, saying I was tired and went to my room to sleep.

But actually, I was giving the sisters some space to be alone.

I had a feeling that Paula wasn't that simple.

After going to my room, I left the door slightly open and listened quietly.

Sure enough, after things quieted down upstairs, Shirley couldn't wait to confront Paula.

"What are you really here for? I send you money every month. What more do you want?"

Paula sneered. "Who can you fool with that little money? You're living so well out here, while Mom and Dad and I are struggling at home. Do you have any conscience?"

"What does that have to do with me? From the moment they favored you and didn't let me go to school, they were no longer my parents. Sending them money is already more than enough."

"Spare me. If it weren't for Mom and Dad, would you be living such a good life? You really don't know how to be grateful."

Shirley sneered. "If Mom and Dad are so great, why did you come here? You couldn't stay there either."

"What does it have to do with you? Why should you live in such a house and eat such food, and I can't have any of it?"

"Whatever, but you have to move out in a month."

"We'll see about that. Where's my guest room?"

Their conversation ended, and I closed the door.

Thinking about the way Brandon looked at Paula earlier made me feel like throwing up.

Shirley must have noticed too; otherwise, she wouldn't be so eager to get Paula to leave.

But since Brandon had his eyes on Paula, Shirley probably couldn't stop her no matter what she did. I was just helping Brandon out a bit.

Watching them fight would be quite entertaining.

That night, Paula stayed at our house. At dinner, we were all seated, and Paula arrived late, wearing a strapless dress, looking very innocent.

Brandon's eyes lit up, while Shirley's face turned dark as she looked at Brandon.

###chapter 26

Shirley slammed the bowl onto the table: "Why are you dressed so inappropriately for dinner? Go back and change immediately."

I looked at Brandon, and sure enough, his eyes seemed glued to Paula.

I couldn't help but sneer inwardly, Shirley, are you nervous?

You've always been the one to steal other people's men, and now Paula has stolen yours? Are you anxious? Are you finally feeling what others felt?

I cleared my throat: "I think Paula looks great, pure and beautiful. It's pleasant to look at her at the dinner table, so let her dress like this."

Shirley was indignant: "But..."

Brandon continued, "Let's listen to Caroline. As long as she's happy, Shirley, stop making a fuss and yelling at the dinner table."

Shirley fell silent immediately, glaring at Paula and me.

But I pretended not to see it and went back to my room after dinner.

At night, just as I was about to go out to get some water, I saw Shirley dressed scantily entering Brandon's room.

Not long after, Shirley was pushed out by him, clearly rejected.

I sneered, went to the kitchen to get water, and overheard Paula and Shirley talking.

I quickly hid in the kitchen, afraid of being seen by the two of them.

Watching the scene unfold was even more thrilling, and my heart was pounding.

Paula blocked Shirley and sneered, "No wonder you wanted me to change clothes at dinner. Turns out you climbed into Mr. Jordan's bed first."

"Does Mrs. Jordan know?"

I couldn't see the scene, but I knew Shirley probably glared at Paula: "What's it to you?"

"Aren't you afraid I'll tell Mrs. Jordan?"

Shirley snorted, "Let me tell you the truth, Brandon and I have been together for a while. Caroline is just a dying person. Once she dies, Mr. Jordan will marry me."

"Really? Just you?"

"What's wrong with me? I've been with Brandon for many years. Don't think you can seduce him just because you're pretty. Look at Brandon, do you think you can seduce him?"

I almost laughed hearing this from Shirley. Doesn't she find it ironic?

Paula didn't say anything, and I didn't know what she was planning.

"Alright, go back to your room. If Caroline wakes up and finds us, I won't let you off."

With that, Shirley went back to her room first. After they both left, I came out of the kitchen and went upstairs.

Shirley is no longer worth dealing with. Paula won't stay quiet, and Shirley will eventually be abandoned by the fickle Brandon.

What I need to do now is find out what Brandon is up to.

The next morning, Brandon took Paula to work, while Shirley stood behind the car, her face full of jealousy.

At noon, after Shirley finished cooking, she said to me, "Mrs. Jordan, I'm going to bring lunch to Mr. Jordan."

It seems Paula's presence has thrown her off balance, something that never happened before. Isn't she afraid I'll suspect something?

Apparently, Shirley couldn't care less. She was almost dying of jealousy that Paula could stay with Brandon all the time.

"You've never brought him lunch before. Why now?"

Shirley didn't catch the implication in my words and said, "I made steak today, Mr. Jordan's favorite, so I'm bringing it to him."

In the past, she never made Brandon's favorite dishes when he wasn't home. Today, it's too obvious.

I didn't say anything, watching her take the lunchbox to the company.

In less than half an hour, Shirley came back, looking very upset.

Knowing Brandon, I could almost recreate the scene.

Shirley brought the lunchbox, only to be scolded by Brandon.

"Do I need you to bring me lunch? Have you forgotten your task? Keep an eye on Caroline. What are you doing here? Get back immediately."

If it were just Brandon scolding her, she wouldn't be this upset. She must have been mocked by her sister Paula.

I watched Shirley angrily throw the lunchbox into the kitchen and then into the trash can, cursing viciously.

Seeing her breakdown made me very happy. I pretended not to see it and went back to my room to feed the kids.

That evening, Brandon came back with Paula, the two of them chatting and laughing.

Shirley's face darkened at the sight.

Brandon's face also darkened when he saw her, clearly remembering the incident at noon.

Paula saw Shirley and smiled smugly, "Shirley, what did you do tonight? I didn't get to eat the lunch you made at noon."

Paula was deliberately causing trouble. Shirley glared at Paula and tried to curry favor by taking Brandon's coat.

But Brandon didn't even look at her and sat at the dining table.

Shirley was about to sit opposite Brandon when he called Paula to sit there instead.

Seeing this, Shirley became even angrier, her face turning all sorts of colors like a palette.

Brandon looked at Paula and asked, "How are you adjusting to work today?"

Paula blushed immediately, "Thanks to Mr. Jordan's help, I'm adjusting well."

The two of them chatted about family matters throughout the meal, and Shirley couldn't get a word in.

I couldn't stand their flirtatious conversation and got up to leave.

Just then, my phone rang, and I quickly went to the bathroom to answer it.

It was Simon calling. Kathy had been staying at Kelly's house these days, so my calls with Simon were irregular.

Simon was surprised I answered, "I was going to ask you to call back tonight, but it's fine now. I discovered something. You need to be prepared."

I took a deep breath, "I'm ready. Go ahead."

Simon's voice was calm and methodical, "You and Brandon have a joint account, right?"

I replied, "Yes, why? My dividends, Brandon's dividends, and the money we earn are all transferred to that account."

"I found out through a friend at the bank that Brandon made several large transfers recently, all to offshore accounts. I suspect he's moving your assets."

I was stunned, "Can you find out who owns the other account?"

Simon replied, "No, the offshore account is very cunning, using multiple personal details. The money was transferred without a trace. And someone like Brandon wouldn't be scammed, so I suspect he's moving the assets himself."

I listened in shock, recalling Brandon's actions, and it all made sense. Brandon's insurance policies and his interest in my family's old house were all about moving the money.

Is he planning to flee abroad?

###chapter 27

Just as I was thinking, Simon suddenly said, "Kathy is coming back soon. As far as I know, the land your family owns won't undergo urban renewal for another year. Brandon probably won't dare to make a move on you within this year, as he wouldn't be able to legally get the money from you."

I nodded. This was something I hadn't considered.

"It looks like I need to find an opportunity to go to the company."

Simon responded with a hum, "Let me know if you need anything."

I thanked him and then hung up the phone.

In the evening, Shirley brought me my medicine. I noticed that the bowl was noticeably half empty and asked, "Why is there so much less medicine?"

Shirley smiled, but her eyes were cold, "Mr. Jordan said your health report came back, and you're much better now, so the medicine can be reduced."

It seemed that Brandon was indeed starting to take action, just as Simon had said.

However, this medicine, which was actually an antidote, was crucial for me. Taking less would be detrimental, so I had to find a way to go out once Kathy returned and get her to help me get some other medicine to take together. Otherwise, my recovery would be even slower.

The next evening, after Brandon came home from work, he was chatting with Paula on the sofa when the doorbell suddenly rang. Shirley, who was washing dishes, immediately went to open the door and saw Kathy standing there, carrying several bags.

"Brandon, where's Caroline?"

As soon as Brandon saw Kathy, he went upstairs to call me. I had already heard Kathy's arrival and couldn't wait to go downstairs.

"Caroline, I went on a trip to the neighboring city and brought you lots of gifts. Come and choose."

Brandon joined in, "Is there anything for me?"

"Of course," Kathy said with a mocking smile, "this is for you."

Kathy took out a Ninja Turtle toy, "I thought it looked like you, so I bought it."

I couldn't help but laugh. Kathy was implying that Brandon looked like a big turtle.

Brandon's mouth twitched, "Thank you."

Kathy continued to take out various skincare products and handed them to me.

"Look at how rough your face has become after a year of illness. Use these quickly; I brought them back especially for you."

Kathy's gifts were always good. I thanked her and accepted them.

Kathy looked around and suddenly noticed Paula, who was sitting on the sofa and curiously observing her.

"Is she a guest at your house?"

I shook my head, "This is Shirley's sister, Paula. She's staying with us and also working as Brandon's secretary."

Kathy casually glanced at Paula, "She's quite pretty. Brandon, you better not get any ideas."

At this, the three of us froze. Brandon forced a smile, "How could I? I love Caroline the most."

Kathy didn't respond and pulled me to sit on the sofa, telling me about the interesting things that had happened in the past few days.

After a few sentences, she suddenly realized, "You were probably discussing something. Caroline and I will go upstairs to talk."

I knew she had something to say to me, so without waiting for Brandon's reaction, we went upstairs and closed the door.

As soon as we entered, Kathy couldn't wait to speak, "Brandon has arranged for a butler to stay with Kelly, supposedly to take care of her, but actually to monitor her."

"I saw him writing down all the details of Kelly's day on his phone and sending them to someone. I suspect it's Brandon."

Brandon hadn't mentioned the butler to me. It seemed he had placed someone there to prevent any accidents with the house.

"You didn't expose yourself, did you?"

"Don't worry, the man thinks I'm one of Kelly's former students, so he didn't pay much attention to me. I found out by chatting with Kelly."

I was relieved. Brandon probably wouldn't dare to do anything to Kelly before the house underwent urban renewal. For now, she was safe.

At that moment, I suddenly heard faint footsteps outside the door.

During my illness, I had spent all my time in a dark room, but my hearing had improved significantly.

I signaled to Kathy with my eyes, and she immediately understood my intention.

We both picked up a child and gently soothed them.

Suddenly, the door was pushed open by Brandon. He entered, looking at us suspiciously.

"Why did you close the door while chatting?"

I shook the child, "The kids are afraid of noise. What do you want?"

Brandon shook his head, "Nothing, just that it's time to eat. Kathy, stay for dinner."

Kathy readily agreed, "Sure, I haven't had enough time to chat with Caroline."

Brandon walked ahead, and Kathy and I walked side by side. She gave me a look and mouthed, "See? He doesn't want us to talk alone."

I nodded. Brandon was definitely feeling guilty about something.

At the dinner table, Kathy and I chatted a lot, while the other three were very silent, eating with their heads down, lost in their thoughts.

After dinner, Brandon offered to drive Kathy home, but she refused.

"What's the rush? Isn't there a guest room? I'll stay here tonight and chat with Caroline all night."

Brandon, of course, disagreed, "No way. Caroline's health is not good; she can't stay up late."

Kathy rolled her eyes, "Fine, I'll sleep in the guest room."

Shirley suddenly spoke up, "Sorry, Ms. Patel, the guest room is occupied by my sister, Paula."

I didn't expect the two of them to be on the same side now.

I looked at Kathy with difficulty, "Maybe you should go home first. I'll visit you in a few days? Brandon has me under house arrest now and won't let me go anywhere. I have to get his permission first."

I said jokingly, but Brandon's face changed.

Seeing this, Kathy had no choice but to let the driver take her home.

Back in my room, I thought about everything Kathy had told me about Kelly and missed her even more.

Kelly didn't know I was sick and would probably blame me for not calling her for so long.

I sighed softly and went to Brandon's study.

He was focused on his computer, and when he saw me, he quickly hid the screen.

I pretended not to notice, "Brandon?"

He immediately put on a gentle smile, "What's up, Caroline?"

"I miss my mom. Can I go see her?"

Brandon frowned, "Why are you thinking about this all of a sudden? Did Kathy say something to you?"

I shook my head, "I just took a nap and dreamed about my mom. I miss her."

Brandon's frown eased a bit.

"You know, in your current state, seeing Kelly would only worry her. How about I take you to see her once you're better?"

I knew Brandon would refuse, and I didn't expect him to agree.

"Alright then. Brandon, you should sleep early. I'm going back to bed."

Brandon nodded gently, "Goodnight, Caroline. I'll go to bed after I finish my work."

As I closed the door, I saw Brandon's frown deepen.

###chapter 28

The next morning, Brandon left early, but I noticed Paula didn't go with him.

So I concluded that Brandon was off doing his own thing and not going to the office.

Before Paula left for work, I stopped her: "Can you drive?"

Paula looked a bit surprised but nodded: "I learned in college, but I'm not very good at it."

I nodded: "There's a car in my garage. You can drive me to the office."

Shirley, who was clearing away the breakfast dishes, immediately became alert: "Mrs. Jordan, Mr. Jordan doesn't want you to go out. Your current health..."

I sneered: "What do you mean he doesn't want me to go out? Is Brandon trying to confine me? Call him right now, and I'll ask him myself."

Shirley realized she had misspoken and immediately fell silent: "I was wrong, Mrs. Jordan. Mr. Jordan is just worried about you. You're not fully recovered yet."

I couldn't be bothered to listen to her nonsense any longer and pulled Paula outside: "Since Brandon isn't confining me, you should mind your own business."

Paula looked back at Shirley and said, "Exactly, Shirley. I think Mrs. Jordan's health has improved a lot recently. It's fine for her to go out for a walk. You're too nervous."

Shirley could only stomp her foot and go back to call Brandon.

But Brandon was wearing casual clothes this morning, probably going somewhere far, so he wouldn't be at the office anytime soon. I just needed to take this opportunity to check out the office.

Paula's driving skills were average. A half-hour drive to the office took her a full hour, and she gave me an apologetic smile when we got out of the car.

"Sorry, Mrs. Jordan. I've never driven such an expensive car before, so I was a bit slow."

I smiled slowly: "It's okay. You look quite attractive. Maybe Brandon can introduce you to a man, and then you can drive such cars often."

Paula didn't know that these cars were bought with the money I earned before. She just thought I was Brandon's sickly wife.

I was instilling this hope in her so that Paula would take action sooner.

After all, who doesn't like luxury cars?

I got out of the car, and before entering the office, Paula said she was going to the locker room to change into her work uniform and told me to go in by myself.

I nodded and looked at the familiar office entrance.

Since I had my child, I rarely set foot here. It seemed to have become Brandon's domain.

My busy days in this building seemed to have gradually faded from memory.

I shook my head, dispelling the negative emotions, and entered through the main door.

The reception area looked the same as before, but the people had completely changed.

I frowned at the sight of the beautiful and self-aware receptionists. They all seemed to be Brandon's type.

As I walked in, I was stopped by the receptionist, who looked me up and down with disdain: "Who are you looking for?"

I frowned slightly. Her tone made me very uncomfortable.

"I'm looking for Asher Wheeler."

I casually mentioned the name of a former subordinate, but the receptionist's eyes widened: "Never heard of him. Get out!"

I was stunned, unable to believe that the company's receptionist had such an attitude.

"What did you say?"

The receptionist looked at me and said, "There's no such person. Are you here to cause trouble? Get out! We don't take in vagrants."

I looked at my outfit, which didn't have a single brand name, but it was custom-made for comfort. Plus, I had put on makeup to look haggard, so I didn't look very presentable.

But that wasn't a reason for her to treat me this way.

What if I were a client?

"What do you mean? Is this your work attitude? What's your name?"

The receptionist rolled her eyes: "What, are you going to complain about me? So what if I tell you? My name is Claire Fairfax. Go ahead and complain."

"Work attitude is for clients, not for vagrants like you."

"Look at how shabby you are dressed. How dare you come into our company? How shameless."

Her words completely angered me. I looked at Claire and sneered: "Do you know who I am? How dare you talk to me like that."

"Stop threatening me. Are you some kind of leader? I'm telling you, as long as I'm here, you won't get in. Get out!"

"With the way you look, if you go in and other clients see you, they'll think our company is going bankrupt."

Claire rolled her eyes and took out a small mirror to touch up her makeup.

I sneered and stood in the lobby, waiting for Paula to return.

I never thought there would come a day when I would be stopped from entering my own company. It was utterly ridiculous.

But this also indirectly showed that the company might have undergone a complete overhaul. After all, when I mentioned Asher's name, she acted like she had never heard of him.

Asher was my CFO back in the day. Everyone in the company knew him. If he were still here, Claire wouldn't have reacted that way.

This only strengthened my resolve to go inside and take a look.

Claire saw me standing in the lobby: "Are you done yet? Get out! You're affecting our company's image, you know?"

"What era are you living in, still wearing such clothes? It's so ugly."

I didn't say anything and waited quietly.

Claire got angry when she saw I wasn't leaving: "Are you going to leave, or do I need to call security to escort you out?"

At that moment, Paula's voice rang out: "Mrs. Jordan, why haven't you gone in?"

Paula had changed into her uniform and was surprised to see me still in the lobby.

Claire didn't know me, but she knew Paula. After all, Brandon had been bringing Paula to work every day recently, so it was hard for the company not to know her.

"Ms. Ross."

Claire greeted her with a smile: "Didn't you come with Mr. Jordan today?"

I looked at her face and thought, her change in attitude was really fast. It's a pity she didn't go into acting.

Paula shook her head at Claire and walked up to me: "Mrs. Jordan, were you waiting for me?"

I pointed at Claire: "This lady wouldn't let me in."

"Mrs. Jordan?"

"Which Mrs. Jordan?"

Claire's face turned pale. She knew what the name Jordan meant in this company.

Paula replied impatiently: "Mr. Jordan's wife, who else? You don't even recognize Mrs. Jordan?"

Claire looked at me, shaking her head repeatedly, her lips pale.

"No, Mrs. Jordan, I really didn't know. Please forgive me. If I had known, I wouldn't have stopped you. Mrs. Jordan, you..."

I sneered: "Didn't you say your work attitude is for clients? Then keep that attitude and find a new job."

With that, I walked straight in without looking at her; Claire collapsed to the ground.

In the elevator, Paula led me to Brandon's office.

She thought I rarely came here, not knowing that this was where I once fought hard.

I looked at the familiar place, but it didn't evoke any memories, only a sense of unfamiliarity.

###chapter 29

As soon as I entered Brandon's office, a few people came up to me.

"Caroline, what brings you here?"

I looked over and saw Brandon's cousin, Earl Jordan, standing in front of me in a suit, looking very polite.

It was obvious that Shirley had called Brandon to inform him, and then Brandon had called the company to have someone deal with me.

I shook my head, "It's nothing, I haven't been here for a long time, I want to check the accounts, call the CFO for me."

Earl's eyes darkened, but he nodded, "Alright, please wait a moment, Caroline."

Then he walked out.

As I watched Earl's back, I couldn't help but feel a sense of irony.

The company my parents left me has now become the Jordan family's business. Brandon's cousin Earl didn't do well in school when he was young and dropped out of high school because he got a girl pregnant.

I spent money to settle the matter and eventually bought him a degree from a very poor university so he could graduate.

Who knew Earl would be brought into my company by Brandon? He looks completely different from his days as a delinquent.

But deep down, Earl is still a delinquent. No matter how well-dressed he is, he's still a useless person.

Before long, Earl brought in a woman, "This is the CFO, Irene Jordan."

I was stunned and looked at Irene, "Why is it you? Where's Asher?"

Irene's expression changed slightly, "Caroline, what do you mean by that? I've been an accountant for twenty years, and I'm more than qualified to be the CFO for Brandon. Don't act like you look down on me."

"Where's Asher?"

Earl immediately stepped forward and answered politely, "Asher was caught cooking the books by Aunt Irene and was fired."

Asher was fired?

Asher was once my most important partner. When I left the company to have children, I told Brandon not to touch Asher no matter what. Did he just ignore what I said?

Irene glanced at me, "Caroline, you're not in good health, so you shouldn't be coming out. The business world is a man's battlefield. What are you doing here?"

I smirked coldly. It seems they've completely forgotten that this company used to be mine and now think it's the Jordan family's property.

"Bring me last year's financial report."

Irene's face changed slightly, "Can you even understand it? The report is already packed up, and it's inconvenient to look at. Don't make trouble for me."

She put on an authoritative air, making me laugh coldly.

At that moment, Brandon suddenly walked into the office.

He walked up to me and said gently, "Why did you come out suddenly? You're not in good health, you should take it easy, or your condition might worsen."

I looked at Brandon and laughed, "I just wanted to check the company's accounts to share some of the burden with you, but Aunt Irene doesn't seem willing to let me see them."

Brandon's face changed, "It's okay, I've already looked at the accounts, there's no big problem. I'll take you home."

I was sure there was something wrong with the accounts, otherwise, why would Brandon and Irene be so reluctant to let me see them?

The company's accounts probably don't have much money left, otherwise, they wouldn't be in such a hurry.

So I didn't insist and followed him out of the company.

As we passed the front desk, I pointed at Claire, "Fire this person. The company can't have a receptionist with such an attitude."

Brandon glared at Claire and then replied gently to me, "Alright, whatever you say."

The driver was waiting at the company entrance, and Brandon helped me into the car.

"Caroline, you go home by yourself. I won't be going back. There's still some work to do at the company, and I have to meet a few suppliers today."

I nodded and watched Brandon go back into the company.

After the driver took me home, I went to my room, locked the door, and called Simon.

"Hello, can you help me find the phone number of someone named Asher? He graduated from the same university as me and is from Majestic City. I can't reach him now."

I briefly explained who Asher was to Simon, and he said he understood.

After hanging up the phone, I felt a bit uneasy. It was clear that I, as a shareholder, had no real power in the company, and the company's executives were all controlled by the Jordan family.

They were slowly eating away at the company my dad left me.

This result made me both angry and sad. Angry at what Brandon and his family were doing, and sad because I felt I was letting my dad, Gerald Sharp, down.

I thought for a moment and then called Kathy, "Kathy, does your dad know a lot of famous lawyers? Can you ask him to find one for me?"

"Sure, what's going on?"

I told her about the situation at the company, "I can accept Brandon messing around behind my back, we can just get a divorce. But now they're trying to take the company my dad left me, and I can't tolerate that. I have to take it back and get rid of that family."

"And most importantly, only by taking back the company will I have a chance to take the kids with me when we divorce. Otherwise, the kids will most likely be given to Brandon."

Kathy knew how important this was and nodded repeatedly, "Don't worry, I'll ask my dad to find the best lawyer for you."

I pursed my lips, "No need to thank me, once we succeed, I'll thank you properly."

"Don't mention it, Caroline. Your business is my business because we're best friends."

After hanging up with Kathy, I went out to feed the kids.

They were sound asleep in their cradles, looking so sweet and peaceful.

Maybe they don't know anything right now, but that's fine. I'll bear all the burdens for my three kids as long as they can be safe and sound.

In the evening, Brandon came home with Paula after work.

I took the opportunity to ask about Asher, and the answer was the same as what Earl had told me.

It seemed that the core staff of the company had already been replaced by him.

I looked at Brandon, my eyes filled with rage, wanting to kill him right then and there.

But I knew I couldn't do that yet, so I had to use my own methods to get back at him.

After dinner, I put a few sleeping pills in Shirley's usual water cup. Sure enough, she got very sleepy after drinking it and went to her room to sleep.

I also pretended to feel unwell and went to lie down in my room.

For a moment, the large living room was left with only Brandon and Paula.

Paula must have taken my words to heart during the day and was probably eager to seduce Brandon to get her hands on a luxury car sooner.

I knew very well that Paula and Shirley were the same kind of people at heart.

###chapter 30

If Paula and Shirley weren't the same person, she wouldn't have rushed over as soon as she found out Shirley's address.

She was jealous that Shirley could live such a life and be involved with Brandon, so the best way to get back at her was to do the same thing as Shirley.

Before I went upstairs, I saw Paula subtly moving closer to Brandon.

The two were in a very ambiguous distance, ready to stick together at any moment.

I returned to my room but didn't close the door tightly, just to wait and confirm the commotion downstairs.

Until I heard rustling sounds coming from downstairs.

I quietly pushed open the door and stood on the second floor looking down.

I saw the two of them already hugging each other at some point, moving excitedly.

Paula was dressed very youthfully tonight, but her actions were all about seducing Brandon, as if she was afraid of failing.

Even the clothes Paula wore were the kind that were both pure and sexy, and during dinner, Brandon's eyes were fixed on Paula.

The two quickly entangled with each other.

If Shirley weren't sleeping in her room right now, she would definitely make a big scene if she saw this.

I watched coldly from upstairs as they entangled and kissed passionately, feeling full of irony.

Brandon really doesn't know how to be picky, which shows that he is inherently lowly. No matter how much money he took from our family, he can't change this flaw.

I felt nothing but disgust watching the two of them, and turned back to my room.

The next morning, I deliberately got up a little late to give them time to clean up the scene downstairs.

When I got up, Brandon was sitting on the sofa with a satisfied look on his face, while Paula next to him had a very coquettish expression. Anyone could see what had happened between the two of them.

Sure enough, when Shirley came downstairs and her gaze fell on the two of them, she looked as if she had been struck by lightning.

At this moment, I couldn't help but marvel at the power of genetics.

Paula and Shirley had the exact same expression after a night with Brandon, no wonder Shirley could see it so easily.

She looked at the two of them in disbelief, but didn't dare to let me notice, even her anger was cautious.

I inexplicably felt a bit sorry for Shirley, seducing Brandon, such a cold-blooded bastard, of all people.

She sat across from them, staring intently at the two, as if trying to confirm something.

And Paula obviously noticed her gaze too, gently pulling open her collar to reveal the love marks, her expression clearly showing off.

As Brandon's bed partner, she of course knew Brandon's habits and confirmed that Paula had indeed slept with Brandon last night.

This was a silent confrontation, but I saw it all.

Paula's eyes were full of provocation, while Shirley looked hurt as she glanced at Brandon, then glared fiercely at Paula before getting up.

Who knew she was so flustered that she accidentally knocked an ashtray off the table, shattering it on the floor.

Brandon, who had barely slept after a night of sex, was resting on the sofa and looked up in annoyance at the sound.

"How can you be so careless?"

Shirley shook her head, looking a bit sad as she went into the kitchen.

It seemed Paula won the first round of this battle.

If Shirley weren't equally damned, I might have felt a bit sorry for her, being seduced by Paula and losing Brandon, how unfortunate.

But how was this any different from when I first met her? When Shirley first came, didn't I treat her like a sister?

I sneered, feeling she deserved it.

"Brandon, I heard some noise downstairs last night, do you know what it was?"

I looked at the two of them flirting with their eyes and asked deliberately.

Sure enough, Brandon's eyes flickered with panic, and he cleared his throat, "I didn't hear anything, you must have misheard."

Paula chimed in, "I didn't hear anything either, Mrs. Jordan, you must have misheard."

I smiled, "Really? Last night I heard noises downstairs that sounded just like the mating sounds of our neighbor's dogs when we were kids, it was disgusting."

"We don't have a dog, so I must have misheard."

Hearing this, Brandon and Paula's faces turned as black as the bottom of a pot, and no one said a word.

I pretended not to notice their expressions and continued, "It's really strange, how could there be dog sounds in our house?"

"Alright, breakfast is ready, let's eat."

Brandon couldn't listen any longer, and when Shirley brought out breakfast, he was the first to go over.

Paula also sat down with a displeased expression.

At the table, Shirley kept glaring at Paula, as if trying to see through her.

To be fair, Paula's mental fortitude was impressive, she remained unfazed, calmly eating breakfast as if Shirley's actions had no effect on her.

After breakfast, Brandon went to the study, and Shirley called Paula to her room.

Of course, I wouldn't miss this show and followed.

I heard Shirley questioning Paula, "Tell me, did you do something with Brandon last night?"

"Yes, we slept together, so what?"

Paula's voice was very calm, while Shirley couldn't control herself anymore and slapped Paula hard.

"You shameless bitch!"

Of course, Paula wasn't one to be trifled with, and she slapped Shirley back just as hard.

"Do you think you're any better? Don't forget, we're the same, both mistresses seducing Brandon. What right do you have to judge me?"

"Besides, you're not young and attractive to Brandon anymore, so why can't someone younger like me replace you?"

"You're lying!"

Shirley shouted at Paula, "Brandon and I have already discussed getting married, once Caroline dies, we'll get married. He's just playing with you."

Paula sneered, "I'll say the same to you, Brandon told me he promised to marry you just because you helped him with something."

"Do you think you're important? Anything you can do, I can do too. Mrs. Jordan could be my position, I'm younger and prettier than you."

The two were about to fight when I called out, "Shirley, what are you doing?"

The noise in the room suddenly quieted, and after a while, Shirley and Paula came out, both with a red handprint on their faces.

"What were you doing in there? Slapping each other?"

My tone was suggestive.

Shirley and Paula exchanged a glance, and Paula spoke first, "There was a mosquito in there, and we were helping each other swat it, but we used too much force."

"You two really are in sync."

I didn't say anything else, these two couldn't fight yet, I needed them to save their strength to cause trouble for Brandon until he couldn't stand it anymore, that was my ultimate goal.

###chapter 31

In extreme situations, people may resort to extraordinary measures. I want to see what Shirley will do.

Meanwhile, Brandon was in the study, unaware of their disputes, and even if he knew, he probably wouldn't care.

After all, in his eyes, women are just playthings that come and go at his beck and call. The only person he truly cares about is himself.

In the afternoon, Brandon told me he had to go out for something, and he seemed to be in a hurry.

After Brandon left, Shirley suddenly came to me, saying she was going out to meet a friend. The fact that they left one after the other made it hard to believe there was no connection.

But I still nodded and agreed.

At the same time, I slipped a miniature tracker into Shirley's bag. It was something I had Simon buy for me a long time ago, thinking it might come in handy someday.

And now, it did.

As soon as Shirley left, I called Simon and asked him to follow them and see where they were going.

Simon understood and hung up the phone, and I waited quietly.

It wasn't until the middle of the night that Shirley came back first, followed by Brandon a little later.

This time, Brandon didn't come to my room. He must have thought I was already asleep, so he went straight to his room.

I locked myself in the bathroom, waiting for Simon's call.

Soon, the phone rang, and I quickly answered, "Simon?"

He responded, "I followed them. It seems Shirley was tailing Brandon, and Brandon didn't know she was following him."

I immediately understood. No wonder Shirley came back before Brandon; she was afraid of being discovered.

"And then? What did Brandon do?"

"He went to meet a woman. She seemed to have just returned from abroad. Brandon picked her up at the airport and took her to a hotel. They didn't come out until just now."

"And Shirley was waiting downstairs the whole time."

"Another woman? Do you know who she is?"

"No, I don't. I've seen most of the people around you, but I've never seen this woman before."

"But Brandon treated her very well and was very gentlemanly."

A woman who just returned from abroad? I couldn't recall anyone around Brandon who had just come back.

And the fact that they stayed in the hotel until now could only mean one thing.

But since when did Brandon treat his lovers so well?

"Do you remember that offshore account? The one Brandon was transferring money to?"

"I remember."

But nothing came of it, so I didn't pursue it further.

"This woman just returned from abroad. I suspect Brandon's offshore account is related to her, which is why he's being so gentlemanly."

I nodded, "You make a good point. I want to see a photo of this woman. Did you take one?"

"I did. I'll find a chance to show you. This woman might be very important to Brandon."

After hanging up, I fell into deep thought.

Nowadays, this feels like a game, with new tasks appearing from time to time. It's worth digging deeper to see how these tasks are connected.

The next morning, after Brandon and Paula went to work, I drugged Shirley as I had done before, putting her into a deep sleep.

Then I went to meet Simon and Kathy at a hidden café.

As soon as she saw me, Kathy had a lot to say.

"Brandon is such a jerk, keeping in touch with so many women at the same time. It's disgusting."

I was already used to Brandon's behavior, so my expression didn't change.

I looked at Simon, "Let me see the photo."

Simon nodded and showed me his phone.

I was stunned when I saw the woman Brandon was holding in the photo because I knew her.

"Elora Kingsley, it's her?"

When I first took over the company, I hired a batch of new employees, and Elora was one of them.

Elora was capable and attractive, so she quickly rose through the ranks, becoming my sales manager in just a few years.

I valued her highly and planned to let her manage the sales department in the future.

When I had a child and stopped managing the company, I specifically mentioned her to Brandon, saying she was a talent and not to let her go.

And Brandon readily agreed.

I should have known. With Elora's beauty, how could Brandon let her go so easily?

In the photo, Brandon was holding Elora as they left the airport and got into a car, looking like a close couple.

If you didn't know better, you'd think they were married.

The photos were like a series, showing them leaving the airport, entering the hotel, and Shirley waiting downstairs, all clearly captured.

In the end, Brandon was holding Elora as they left the hotel.

I sneered, "I should have known. When I went to the company last time, I thought she had been fired by Brandon, but it turns out they were already involved. I overestimated Brandon."

"Brandon is such a jerk. If I catch him, I'll beat him to death."

I suddenly realized a doubt, "How did Shirley know Brandon was going to pick up Elora? And her information seems more accurate than ours."

Simon and I exchanged a glance, "I suspect Shirley also installed some monitoring software on Brandon's phone. Otherwise, she wouldn't know he was going to pick up Elora."

"But I'm more curious about what Shirley will do now that she's seen her sister Paula successfully seduce Brandon, and he has another beautiful lover like Elora."

After all, Shirley was one of Brandon's accomplices in drugging me, so she must know some of his secrets. Otherwise, she wouldn't have stayed in this position for so many years.

After a while, I sighed, "Let's observe how things develop."

After parting with Simon and Kathy, I returned home. Shirley was still asleep in her room.

Seeing that there was still some time before Brandon and Paula got off work, I suddenly picked up Shirley's phone. Using her hand, I unlocked it and entered the phone's interface.

Shirley's WhatsApp chat history was also clean, probably on Brandon's instructions.

Except for one, a pinned message from James Carr: "See you tomorrow morning at Savory Bites."

Anyone Shirley pinned must be important, especially since she didn't even pin Brandon.

I had a feeling this James was significant, so I noted the location, marked the message as unread, and quietly left Shirley's room.

Now I just had to wait until tomorrow morning when Brandon and Paula went to work, and I would follow Shirley to see what she was up to.

###chapter 32

The next day, after Brandon and Paula went to work, Shirley indeed asked for leave and went out.

I readily agreed, but as soon as she left, I immediately followed her in my car.

I arrived at Savory Bites ahead of her.

I saw Shirley go inside from my car, and I quickly followed her in.

Fortunately, each table here had partitions, so Shirley couldn't see me, but I could still hear her talking.

The person she was waiting for hadn't arrived yet. I ordered food for a while before I heard someone arrive late.

"Bertha, I'm here."

Shirley's voice was full of impatience: "I told you not to call me Bertha, I go by Shirley now."

James's voice was rough, and he waved his hand casually: "You can call yourself whatever you want, I'm just used to calling you Bertha."

Shirley clicked her tongue and finally stopped correcting him.

"I asked you, did you find out who that woman was yesterday?"

I realized they were talking about Elora. It seemed that Shirley's well-informed nature had something to do with this James.

"That kind of thing isn't so easy. Brandon really is lucky, the women around him are more beautiful one after another."

"Why are you chasing after him? For money?"

"He's better than you. All you do is drink all day. If I don't go after him, should I go after you?"

I was stunned. It seemed their relationship wasn't simple.

James laughed: "What's wrong with me? Haven't I ever satisfied you? Don't pretend you don't know me after putting your pants back on."

"By the way, when do you have time? Let's see if Brandon is better or if I am."

"Get lost. You're not even as good as Brandon's toe."

Shirley snorted coldly, her tone full of disdain.

"Fuck, tell me clearly, how am I not as good as him? He looks useless."

James slammed the table and stood up angrily.

"Enough, you're embarrassing. I have serious business to discuss with you."

Seemingly aware of the attention from people around, Shirley said impatiently: "Hurry up and find out about that person for me. Also, I'll find a way to get Paula out of here, and you use some means to get her to another city, got it?"

"Shirley, you're really ruthless, not even sparing Paula."

Shirley sneered: "If she dares to compete with me for Brandon, she has to be prepared for this."

"Also, find out about that woman as soon as possible. I'll transfer the money to you later."

Seeing Shirley get up, I sneaked out from the other side and drove home first.

Not long after, Shirley came back.

She stayed in her room for a while, then stood in front of me: "Mrs. Jordan, I have something to tell you."

I looked at her and nodded: "Go ahead."

"Paula staying at home for so long makes me feel embarrassed, especially since you even arranged a job for her. So, I've decided to have Paula move out. I really feel bad about taking the salary you give me every month."

I looked at her, thinking about what she had said to James earlier.

I feared that once Paula moved out, she wouldn't come back.

"Paula is quite lovely. Brandon and I... both like her."

I emphasized the last sentence. My words were casual, but Shirley's eyes filled with jealousy: "That's not a reason for us to stay. Paula must move out."

Seeing her insistence, I pretended to be helpless and nodded: "Alright, we'll do as you say. But Paula can move back anytime. I'm home all day and chatting with Paula is a good way to pass the time."

Shirley nodded and left after seeing me agree.

I watched Shirley's back, thinking of Paula, who was very similar to her.

Paula might look youthful on the surface, but she was no ordinary character. How could she leave so easily?

It was really hard to tell who would come out on top between Shirley and Paula.

In the evening, when Brandon and Paula came back from work, Shirley brought up the matter at the dinner table.

"Mr. Jordan, I've found a place for Paula. She should move out in the next few days. I really feel bad about her continuing to stay here and bothering you."

Brandon didn't feel bothered at all. After all, he was the beneficiary, and Paula was now the closest to him, so he naturally didn't want her to leave.

But Shirley's reason was legitimate, and he couldn't refute it, so he looked at me.

"Caroline, what do you think?"

I shrugged: "This is Shirley's opinion. We haven't asked Paula what she thinks."

This was ultimately a drama between the sisters. I threw the question back to see how they would handle it.

Paula bit her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, looking pitifully at Brandon.

Paula's fragile appearance was hard for anyone to resist.

Sure enough, Brandon's eyes began to cloud.

"I know it's not good to bother Mr. and Mrs. Jordan, but I really can't bear to be apart from Shirley. How about I move out with Shirley so I can be close to her?"

"Paula is trying to create a lose-lose situation."

Brandon couldn't agree to Shirley moving out. There would be no one to monitor me then.

Shirley didn't expect Paula to pull this trick, dragging her into it. She glared at Paula fiercely.

I looked at Brandon: "Brandon, they are sisters. Why not let them stay? Our family can afford to feed one more person."

Brandon was eager for me to express my opinion first, so he immediately nodded: "Alright, let's do that. Shirley, don't worry about anything else. Let Paula stay, and we'll discuss other things later."

Brandon waved his hand, making the decision.

Shirley wanted to say something but couldn't, so she could only glare at Paula in frustration.

If Shirley couldn't get rid of Paula, she might resort to other means. There would probably be a good show tonight.

That night, I heard some noise upstairs. Peeking through the door crack, I saw Shirley, dressed scantily, heading to Brandon's room.

After all, Brandon had been busy with Paula and Elora lately and probably hadn't touched Shirley for a long time. She must have been anxious.

But honestly, with Elora's beauty and Paula's purity, Shirley really couldn't compare.

Sure enough, it wasn't long before Shirley was thrown out.

She stood at the door for a long time before walking away silently.

As soon as she went downstairs, she saw Paula coming up, her tone full of mockery: "You got kicked out? But Brandon asked me to come to his room."

In the dark, Shirley glared at her for a long time before gritting her teeth: "Don't be smug. Brandon is just after your youth and beauty, it's just a novelty."

Paula pouted: "Shirley, don't forget, you don't even have youth and beauty anymore!"

###chapter 33

These words obviously hit Shirley's sore spot, and she stepped forward and slapped Paula hard.

"Don't be complacent, sooner or later I'll drive you away."

Paula covered her face and laughed triumphantly, her eyes shining in the dark as if they were on fire.

"Then we'll see if Mr. Jordan is willing to let me go."

With that, Paula strode into Brandon's room and turned off the light.

I watched Shirley stare in the direction of Brandon's room for a long time, then stomped her foot in frustration.

The next day, after Shirley made breakfast, Paula and Brandon sat down.

I thought Shirley would have the same gloomy expression as before, but to my surprise, she was unexpectedly calm,

She even reached out and gave Paula an egg.

Of course, besides me, Paula was also surprised, after all, last night Shirley seemed to want to eat her alive.

I frowned, what's wrong with Shirley today? Is she crazy or has she changed her nature?

From what I know about her, Shirley is probably brewing some other plan in her mind, otherwise, she wouldn't be so calm.

After all, Shirley was chosen by Brandon to do things, she has some scheming.

After breakfast, Brandon and Paula went to work.

After feeding the kids, I walked to the living room, and Shirley was sitting on the sofa watching TV, as if nothing had happened last night.

I felt a bit strange, but Kathy left me a message asking me to go out and meet him, so I couldn't care much, I drugged Shirley as usual, and after she fell asleep, I left home and went to the place agreed with Kathy.

It was a members-only restaurant, the waiter led me to a very private room, Simon and Kathy were already sitting and waiting for me.

Seeing me sit down, Simon took out a thick file bag from behind him: "What you want to know is basically all here."

I was delighted, quickly took it and started reading eagerly.

Simon is thorough in his work, so the information is also complete.

As I read, he said to me, "Renee is a drug addict, so she knows a lot of people in the black market, so the Jordan family contacts the black market through her."

"You started feeling unwell after giving birth, right?"

I nodded, I thought it was because my body hadn't recovered well, could there be another reason?

Seemingly knowing what I was thinking, Simon nodded at me: "Yes, Brandon bought poison through Renee's black market connections and poisoned you."

"But Brandon's idea is extremely vicious, he was afraid that directly poisoning you would be found out, so he first poisoned you to make your body worse, and then used drugs to slowly exhaust your life."

Kathy couldn't hold back anymore: "Fuck, Brandon is such a bastard."

Simon continued: "Also, I suspect that the Jordan family members were all involved in poisoning you."

I had already thought of this, last time I went to the company, Irene and Earl were not surprised to see me at all, which means they had planned this conspiracy against me together.

Kathy slapped the table: "Their family is really cold-blooded and shameless? If it weren't for Caroline marrying Brandon, they wouldn't have been able to move up the social ladder, now they live in a small villa?"

"Brandon's mom was still collecting scrap back then, and now they've forgotten all about the old days in just a few years? A family of ungrateful people."

"Caroline, you must take back the company, you can't let this bastard family take it."

I nodded, this company is my father Gerald's lifelong effort, I once trusted it to Brandon, now I must take it back completely.

Simon nodded, frowning slightly: "But this is very difficult, the Jordan family is colluding with each other, they have already controlled all the top positions in your company, and even many relatives are placed in middle positions, now although it is nominally yours, it has become Brandon's family business."

"If you want to take it back, you must plan carefully, and you can't let Brandon find out about our plan."

I nodded: "He is already transferring assets abroad, so we must do a good job of keeping it secret."

Simon nodded: "There is more information, you can take a look."

I continued to read: "Earl and Irene can be said to be the most powerful people besides Brandon. But there seems to be some friction between them."

"Earl is young, while Irene has been in the workplace for many years, so Brandon obviously trusts Irene more, which leads to a lack of centralized power distribution."

"Earl is now eager to prove his ability, but so far he has not achieved much."

Simon and I exchanged a glance, feeling that we both thought of the same thing.

Kathy looked at us and said: "What are you planning?"

Simon gestured for me to speak: "Earl is so anxious now, why don't we send him someone as our undercover, he probably doesn't have time to check this person's background carefully."

"This way, if something happens in the company, we can get the news out in time."

Simon nodded: "That's right, and I happen to have a candidate, with good business ability!"

My eyes lit up, Simon is indeed reliable.

I only had a rough idea, but he had already found a candidate.

"Then I'll trouble you, thank you so much."

Simon lowered his eyes and smiled lightly: "You're welcome."

Kathy patted Simon's shoulder with a smile: "Caroline, don't be polite with him, his fees are not low."

I nodded, I was already mentally prepared, even if it costs me everything, I must take back my children and company, then everything can start over.

Simon didn't say anything, but continued to take out some documents from the file bag.

"The next thing you need to be mentally prepared for, Brandon's actions are really disgusting."

I was a bit curious, what could be so shocking that Simon would say that.

He took out a stack of documents and placed them on the table: "I investigated Elora and found that she and Brandon have another family, and they have a child together."

I was shocked, looking at Simon in disbelief: "What did you say?"

Simon placed the photos he took in front of me, showing Brandon and Elora taking their child to a restaurant.

All three had smiles on their faces, a picture of a happy family.

"According to my observation, Brandon takes time every week to accompany Elora and her child, I went to the child's school and found that the person picking up the child is none other than her."

Simon pushed a photo towards me, showing an old lady holding the child's hand, and that old lady was none other than Brandon's mother, Karen Sinclair.

In other words, their whole family already knew about Elora's identity and accepted it.

###chapter 34

"These bastards!"

Kathy slammed the table in anger, then looked at me nervously, "Caroline, don't get upset. You're not in good health right now, and it's not worth getting angry over these disgusting people."

I nodded, knowing Kathy was worried about me.

But my mental resilience has grown much stronger than before.

Ever since I found out that my husband Brandon, whom I had loved for so many years, had turned against me, my heart gradually became hardened and numb.

Although the subsequent events completely shattered my worldview, I have come to accept them all.

I nodded, "Don't worry, I'm mentally prepared for what the Jordan family is like. I won't be upset over them anymore."

Kathy finally nodded and sat down, relieved.

But while I have accepted it, my hatred has only deepened.

I flipped through the photos Simon had taken, showing Brandon holding the child twice, while Elora and Brandon's mom, Karen, held the child most of the time.

It's laughable that Brandon chose to send my son Brett to boarding school because he was too lazy to take care of him, yet he treats the two children so differently.

I sneered, "Brandon, if you can't even pretend to be a good father, then you have no place in my children's lives."

Simon put away the documents. I couldn't take those things back with me, as it wasn't safe.

I looked at the two of them and continued, "It seems that since Elora can give Brandon a child, he is quite satisfied with her."

Simon nodded, "That's right. Before Elora returned from abroad, Brandon had many women around him, never the same one twice. But once Elora appeared, there was no one else."

"He probably plans to get rid of you and then elevate Elora to the position of Mrs. Jordan. And that woman named Shirley is just a tool Brandon can discard at any time."

I agreed. Back then, I stepped back and arranged for Brandon to join the company, and my most capable subordinate at the time was Elora.

I was worried that the company's old employees wouldn't accept Brandon, so I arranged for her to help him with his performance.

She knew almost all the core information, data, and secrets of my company at that time.

This led to Brandon later clearing out the old employees and smoothly bringing in the Jordan family members, all thanks to Elora's help.

Afterward, Elora naturally got together with Brandon, and with his help, they successfully sidelined me.

Elora then left the company to avoid suspicion, but in reality, she went abroad to have a baby and returned afterward.

"I wonder if Shirley knows she could be discarded by Brandon at any moment. She might still be dreaming of becoming Brandon's wife."

Speaking of Shirley, I suddenly remembered, "Simon, do you know someone named James around Shirley?"

Simon thought for a moment, "You must be talking about Shirley's first love when she was a waitress. After she got together with Brandon, James came to this city, likely arranged by Shirley."

I nodded, "It seems James is taking money from Shirley to do things for her."

"I overheard her talking to James yesterday, asking him to investigate Elora. Maybe we can use this opportunity to let Shirley know about Elora and her child."

Simon immediately understood my intention, "Leave it to me."

I thanked him. It was already noon, and I was worried Shirley might wake up early, so I prepared to leave.

Simon cautiously checked outside the room, and then we went our separate ways.

Having figured out their background, I felt a moment of relief, but it was quickly replaced by anxiety.

Even though I had Simon and Kathy helping me, my chances still seemed slim.

Brandon had deceived me for so many years, and I was always a step behind, but at least it's not too late to wake up now.

When I got home, Shirley was still asleep on the couch.

I woke her up, "What's wrong with you these days? Why are you sleeping all the time?"

Shirley was startled and quickly got up, "I guess I haven't been sleeping well at night."

She probably wasn't sleeping well because of Paula, who was a constant threat to her.

"Go make dinner, I'm hungry."

Shirley nodded and went to the kitchen.

I watched her back, thinking that if she found out about Elora, it would be an interesting drama.

And I suddenly thought of a crucial point.

When I overheard Shirley and James talking, James said to Shirley before I left, "He doesn't love you. He's just using you. Can't you see that?"

"Do you have to wait until he abandons you to be satisfied?"

And Shirley replied, "Don't worry, he wouldn't dare. He should see what I have on him."

I was in a hurry to leave at the time and didn't pay much attention to this conversation. But now that I think about it, Shirley's confidence must come from having some leverage or secret about Brandon.

If I could get hold of that secret, my chances might improve.

But it would be difficult to get it out of Shirley now. Only by pushing her to a desperate situation could I use this card.

After dinner, I went to feed the children. They were sleeping soundly, unaware of what was happening.

Although my body was slowly recovering, I was still very tired, so I couldn't help but fall asleep on the bed.

Even though this house was still dangerous, as long as the urban renewal funds for my old family home hadn't been released, Brandon wouldn't dare to touch me.

So I slept peacefully.

When I woke up, it was already evening. Shirley had finished cooking, and Brandon was sitting on the couch watching the news.

Seeing me, he gave a gentle smile, "You're awake? I saw you sleeping soundly, so I didn't want to disturb you."

I looked at his hypocritical face and said slowly, "I just had a dream about someone. You'd never guess who."

"Who?" Brandon asked, feigning interest.

"I dreamed about Elora. I haven't seen her in a long time. What position does she hold in the company now?"

When Brandon heard me mention Elora's name, the remote control fell to the floor.

He picked it up nonchalantly, but there was still a hint of evasion in his eyes, "She resigned."

"Elora resigned?" I pretended not to know, "Why? Elora is very capable."

Brandon cleared his throat, "I heard she had a baby. Maybe she wants to focus on her family."

###chapter 35

Hearing this from Brandon's mouth made it even more ironic.

I sneered, he really had the nerve to speak.

But I still pretended to know nothing: "I should arrange a time to chat with her. This Elora resigned without telling me, wasting all the effort I put into training her."

Brandon's eyes were filled with guilt: "Maybe she felt embarrassed."

"Do you have her contact information? I'll reach out to her first."

As soon as I finished speaking, Brandon sat up straight and said firmly, "No!"

Then he glanced at me and continued, "No, how would I have her contact information?"

Who would believe Brandon wasn't hiding something from me with that look?

I nodded as if I hadn't noticed anything: "I was just asking, why are you so nervous?"

"Shirley has finished cooking, let's go eat."

Brandon nodded and got up to leave.

He was obviously afraid I would ask something else.

I glanced at Shirley, who had been serving dishes. I mentioned Elora's name on purpose, partly to test Brandon and partly to remind Shirley.

After all, she was also investigating Elora. She would surely realize that Elora was not ordinary.

We finished our meal with our own thoughts. I saw Paula carrying a teacup into Brandon's room, but she came out shortly after.

I realized that since Elora came back, Brandon must have neglected Paula, but she didn't know anything and just thought she had fallen out of favor.

Shirley also noticed this scene. She looked at Paula going downstairs and gave her a mocking smile.

I went back to my room, checked on the kids, and went to bed early.

Because tomorrow I was going to bring my Brett home. Since Brandon and Elora's child didn't have to board, why should my Brett?

At the breakfast table the next morning, I brought this up with Brandon, who unsurprisingly disagreed.

"Two kids are already enough for you to handle. Who will take care of Brett when he comes back? Who will pick him up and drop him off at school?"

I sneered, feeling disgusted by Brandon's shirking of responsibility.

He could pick up and drop off his illegitimate child, but not Brett. He had completely different attitudes.

"But Brandon, Kathy told me she saw you standing at the gate of a private school..."

As soon as I said this, Brandon stood up as if ignited: "I wasn't, she was mistaken."

I continued, "But she took a photo, and it was clearly you. I thought you were already planning to transfer Brett to a new school. Why else would you go there?"

Brandon certainly didn't want me to know about his other child, but he couldn't explain why he went there. Finally, he gritted his teeth and looked at me: "Yes, I was checking out the school. I was worried Brett wasn't doing well at the boarding school."

"I heard from Kathy that the school is a bilingual international school with a great educational environment. Why don't we send Brett there?"

At this point, I felt a surge of anger. Brett's boarding school cost over $100,000 a year, but Elora's child's school cost nearly $1,000,000 a year.

Brandon was really generous.

Hearing this, Brandon's face looked terrible, but he had no other choice.

After all, he was checking out the school for his illegitimate child, not Brett.

"Fine, you decide."

With that, he got up and left as if he couldn't stay any longer.

Paula hadn't finished her breakfast and quickly followed him.

I sneered at Brandon's back: You love picking up that illegitimate child, don't you? Then I'll make sure you never dare to go there again.

In the evening, I told Shirley, "I'm going out for a bit."

Shirley was stunned and stepped forward to stop me: "But Mr. Jordan said..."

"What did he say? Is he really going to imprison me?"

Of course, Shirley didn't dare say that, so she gritted her teeth and said, "Then I'll go with you, Mrs. Jordan."

I frowned: "What? You're not going to take care of the kids? Are you following me to monitor me? Is this Brandon's idea?"

With my questioning, Shirley didn't dare speak and didn't stop me.

I went to the garage, got into a sports car I had bought before, and drove straight to that school.

But to my surprise, my son Brett's school was right across from this school.

Brandon had found this school, telling me it had a beautiful environment and good teachers. I believed him because of my health and never came to check.

But today, I couldn't help but feel heartbroken.

I couldn't imagine how Brett would feel if he was stuck in there and saw Brandon picking up another child across the street.

I went straight into Brett's school and told the principal about the transfer.

Brett saw me and jumped up excitedly: "Mom, are you here to pick me up?"

I patted his head: "From now on, Mom will pick you up every day."

Brett jumped up happily and followed me out of the school.

I took him across the street and pointed to the school: "How about you go to school here? Mom will pick you up every day."

As expected, I saw Elora waiting at the gate. She was strikingly beautiful, with a voluptuous figure and an outstanding presence in the crowd.

Brett was overjoyed. I held his hand and walked around the school gate, suddenly calling out to Elora: "Elora?"

She was stunned and turned to see my face.

"Caroline? What are you doing here?"

Her eyes flashed with avoidance, then she smiled at me, her psychological quality was not ordinary.

"My son Brett used to go to a boarding school, but Brandon told me the conditions there weren't good and said he would transfer Brett here. Are you here to pick up your child?"

Elora's eyes darkened: "Yes, my child goes to school here."

"Brandon told me yesterday that you had a child, but I didn't believe it. Why didn't you tell me when you resigned?"

Elora smiled faintly: "When I resigned, I heard you were sick, so I didn't want to bother you. After so long, it would have seemed deliberate to bring it up."

I waved my hand: "No worries, I just brought Brett to check out the school environment today. Let's have a meal together sometime."

As we spoke, Elora's child came out of the school gate.

He immediately ran into Elora's arms, calling her "Mommy" non-stop.

I looked at the child, my eyes slightly cold.

He really looked like Brandon.

Elora glanced at me guiltily and told the child to greet me.

"Hello, Caroline."

I patted his head and forced a smile: "What's your name?"

"My name is Jason Jordan."

###chapter 36:

"Jason."

I read the name with a hint of amusement, "What a coincidence, your husband's last name is also Jordan?"

Elora nodded but didn't say anything, a look of pride in her eyes.

I looked at Jason, "When Brett transfers here for school, Jason should play with him more often."

There were quite a few students leaving school, and after saying goodbye to Elora, I took Brett to Karen's house.

I hadn't forgotten the smile on Karen's face when she picked up Jason. Since that's the case, she, as a grandmother, should treat all her grandchildren equally.

I arrived at Karen's villa and opened the door.

I had Brett call out for his grandmother, and he obediently did so.

Karen quickly came out, "Oh, my good grandson, my dear, I..."

But as soon as she saw Brett, Karen's smile immediately faded.

She probably thought Elora had brought Jason, the illegitimate child.

Seeing Karen's smile disappear, Brett timidly held my hand, "Mom, Grandma doesn't seem to like me."

I chuckled softly and glanced at Karen, "How could Grandma not like you? You're her only grandson of this age, and all the family inheritance will be yours. Do you think Grandma likes you?"

I said, glancing at Karen again, "Isn't that right, Mom?"

Karen gritted her teeth and nodded, "Of course, my inheritance will go to my most beloved grandson."

She didn't mention Brett's name, but I knew she was referring to Jason.

I sneered and unceremoniously took Brett into the house.

"Brett hasn't seen you in a long time. I hope you don't mind if we stay the night."

Karen's eyes were full of disgust, but she couldn't say it out loud, so she just nodded, "Then come in."

I took Brett to sit on the sofa.

There were many toys in her house, and since Brett didn't come often, it was obvious who those toys were for.

I let Brett play with the toys without hesitation and went upstairs to check out Brandon's old room.

After all, a person's character is somewhat reflected in the place they live, and I wanted to see what I had missed before.

I went in, and Brandon's room followed the black theme of his office.

The bed was neatly made, and the wardrobe doors were closed.

I casually lifted the pillow and found a pair of red lace panties underneath, almost transparent.

It was clearly Elora's. I couldn't believe these two shameless people were so blatant here.

I put the pillow back and was about to open the wardrobe when I heard a voice from downstairs.

"Who told you to play with those toys? Brett, how can you be so ill-mannered, unlike other kids who are polite. You can't compare to him!"

When I went down, Brett was already crying, holding a toy.

I knew exactly who Karen was referring to, Jason.

"Mom, aren't these toys for Brett? Then who are they for?"

Karen's face stiffened, "A neighbor's kid I like, I let him play here for a while, and Brett just took his toys without asking, really ill-mannered."

I sneered, "Isn't it because Brandon sent Brett to boarding school, who's to blame?"

"What does this have to do with Brandon? Isn't it because you didn't educate Brett well?"

I was about to retort when I suddenly heard Brandon's voice at the door.

He looked like he had just rushed over from the company, "Caroline, why are you here?"

Someone must have tipped Brandon off, otherwise, he wouldn't have come so quickly.

"Brett hasn't seen Karen in a long time, and when we got here, he played with a toy, and Karen scolded us."

Brandon frowned and looked at Karen, "Mom, what do you mean? If Brett wants to play with the toys, let him. What's the problem?"

"But that..."

Karen was about to say a name but was silenced by Brandon's glare.

"If he wants to play, let him. I don't care."

Karen walked away angrily, and Brandon came over to hold my hand.

"Don't mind her, Mom is going through menopause, so her temper isn't great."

"You should have told me you were coming out. I was planning to handle Brett's matters personally, but you were in such a hurry."

His voice was gentle, showing no sign of the man who had so many mistresses outside.

"Really? I was just worried Brett would miss us at school, so I plan to pick him up from now on. What do you think?"

Brandon's face froze for a moment, then returned to normal, "Sure, as long as you're happy."

I continued, "Guess who I saw today?"

"Who?"

"Elora. I didn't expect she really had a child, and her husband's last name is also Jordan. Isn't that a coincidence?"

"The most important thing is, Brett will be going to school with her child, Jason."

As I spoke, I watched Brandon's expression.

A strange look flashed across his face, but he quickly returned to normal, "That's great, Brett will have a companion at school."

"Caroline, let's go home. I'm starving."

Seeing him eager to leave, I thought of the panties under the pillow upstairs and couldn't help but sneer.

Brandon was afraid I'd find out and was feeling guilty.

"I rarely come to Mom's place, let's stay the night. I see your room is very clean, probably because Mom misses you and cleans it often."

Brandon's eyes showed panic, and he tried to pull me away, "How can that be? The kids at home need you."

I shook off his hand, "Shirley is at home, let her take care of the kids. She has done it before."

Brandon frowned slightly, "Didn't you say the kids aren't close to you? How can you let Shirley take care of them?"

"There will be plenty of opportunities in the future. We can come back when the kids are a bit older."

He bent down and gently said to Brett, "Brett, let's go home with Daddy, okay?"

Brett wiped away the tears from Karen's scolding and nodded.

With Brett leaving, there was no reason for me to stay. I followed Brandon to the car.

When we got home, Shirley had already prepared dinner.

After dinner, I took Brett to my room to rest.

He cried and insisted on sleeping in the same room with me.

Of course, I wouldn't refuse. Just as I was about to run a bath for him, Brandon came in.

"Caroline, it's rare for our family to be together, I'll sleep with you two tonight."

After so many years of marriage, although I couldn't see through him, I knew his purpose for doing this.

He was just feeling guilty and wanted to see my reaction, to see if I had noticed anything unusual.

I smiled, "Sure, Brandon, Brett misses you too."

###chapter 37

After Brett finished his bath, he lay down between Brandon and me, laughing non-stop.

Brett's laughter released the emotions I had been suppressing for a long time. Even with Brandon lying next to me, I felt very happy.

"What's up with you? Why are you so happy today?"

Brett excitedly said, "I love sleeping with Mom and Dad the most, but ever since my younger siblings were born, we haven't slept together anymore."

The room suddenly fell silent.

I didn't want to lie to Brett and couldn't bring myself to say that Mom and Dad would often be with him in the future.

Brandon, however, smiled and said, "If you like it, we can do this often."

I found it ridiculous. Didn't he feel awkward?

"Really, Dad?"

Brett shouted excitedly and turned to me, "Mom, did you hear what Dad said?"

"I heard it. Your dad is so busy, I hope he can keep his promise."

Brandon also fell silent, perhaps thinking of something.

After the room quieted down, Brett gradually fell asleep, and I closed my eyes as well.

Sure enough, after a while, Brandon sat up, and the light from his phone screen shone on his face.

Suddenly, he accidentally played a voice message.

"Brandon, can you come to see me tomorrow? I miss you."

Brandon was startled and quickly put his phone away.

I continued to pretend to be asleep, not letting Brandon notice.

"Caroline? Are you asleep? I accidentally played a short video."

Seeing that I didn't respond, he sighed in relief and took a pillow to leave the bed.

After he left, I sneered. It seemed Elora was lonely at night. Since she wanted to see Brandon, I would help her.

The next morning, I asked Brandon, "Brandon, where did you go last night?"

Brandon replied without changing his expression, "I took a call in the middle of the night to avoid disturbing you, so I went back to sleep."

I nodded and continued, "The transfer can be done in the morning. You should come with me to pick up Brett in the evening."

Brandon was taken aback and instinctively refused, "You can go by yourself. Why do I need to go?"

Of course, I wanted you to see Elora. Didn't Elora miss you?

But I didn't say that. Instead, I smiled at Brandon, "Did you forget what you promised Brett last night? He would be very happy to see you pick him up."

Brandon frowned, hesitated for a while, and finally nodded, "Alright, let's do that."

That evening, I left on time and went to the company.

This time, no one dared to stop me. I went straight to Brandon's office, where Earl was talking to him, and there was someone else I hadn't seen before.

After a brief eye contact with that person, I looked at Brandon, "Let's go, we need to pick up Brett."

Brandon was momentarily stunned before reacting, "Alright, let's go."

Seeing his calm demeanor, I realized he must have informed Elora.

But I had already asked Simon for help to have someone watch for Elora at the school gate. I would go over when she appeared.

Brett was also waiting with his homeroom teacher.

So, I dragged Brandon around the area until my phone vibrated in my pocket, signaling that Elora had appeared.

I quickly pulled Brandon over, just in time to run into Elora.

Brandon's expression was, of course, unhappy. He had planned to avoid Elora, but unexpectedly ran into her.

"I told you to come early and not wander around."

He sounded a bit impatient. I coldly looked at him, "Who are you talking to? Besides, I thought there would be a lot of people at dismissal, so I wanted to come a bit later. I already informed the teacher. Why are you in such a hurry?"

Brandon's demeanor softened immediately, "Alright, Caroline, I was just worried Brett would get anxious. Let's get out of the car."

At this point, it would be strange if he didn't get out of the car.

Sure enough, as soon as we got out, we ran into Elora.

The two exchanged a quick glance before looking away.

I pretended not to notice and smiled, "Elora, what a coincidence. We came so late and still ran into you?"

Elora could only nod in agreement, "Caroline, Mr. Jordan, what a coincidence."

Just then, the last group of children came out, including Brett and Jason.

The moment Brandon saw the children coming out, he turned around, but I couldn't let him get away with it.

I pulled Brandon, "Brett is out."

Jason came out first and his eyes lit up when he saw Brandon, "Dad, why are you here!"

Saying that, he rushed forward to hug Brandon.

Both Brandon and Elora's faces changed, "You got the wrong person. I'm not your dad."

At this moment, Brett came out and was overjoyed to see Brandon, "Dad, you came to pick me up!"

Brandon smiled and nodded, bending down to pick up Brett.

Seeing this, Elora's eyes darkened.

Jason watched as Brandon, who always doted on him, held Brett, and he couldn't hold back his tears.

"Mom, Dad doesn't want me anymore!"

Brandon glared at Jason, signaling Elora to handle it.

Elora's eyes showed a mix of reluctance and heartache, but she still bent down to pick up Jason.

"Silly Jason, look, is this your dad? This is Mr. Jordan, you got the wrong person."

Elora then apologized to me, "Sorry, Caroline, don't misunderstand. Jason probably hasn't seen his dad in a long time, so he got confused."

I waved my hand, "It's okay, I don't mind."

"After all, Jason does look a lot like Brandon, no wonder he got confused."

Both of their expressions changed, and Elora forced a smile, "Indeed, they do look a bit alike. I hadn't noticed until you mentioned it, Caroline."

"Since we ran into each other, why don't we have a meal together?"

I suggested.

Brandon instinctively refused, "No, Elora has something to do."

Realizing his mistake, he quickly added, "I guessed, I guessed."

Brandon quickly explained, "If you don't believe me, ask her."

Elora smiled, "Caroline, Mr. Jordan is right. I would love to have a meal and catch up, but I'm really not available today. How about another day?"

I nodded, feeling a bit disappointed, "Alright then."

"But you have to give me your contact information so I can reach you later."

Elora didn't refuse and agreed.

I suddenly remembered that my phone was still with Brandon. Recently, his restrictions on my outings had noticeably loosened.

So on the way back, I took the opportunity to ask for my old phone back, as my health was gradually improving.

###chapter 38

Brandon was driving, focused on the road ahead, his expression unchanged: "Caroline, I accidentally broke your phone. I'll buy you a new one another day."

I frowned slightly, looking at Brandon's face in the rearview mirror.

My phone wasn't broken at all; he just didn't want to give it to me, using this as an excuse to buy time.

"No need, just get any one."

Brandon glanced at me distractedly: "How can that be? You should have the best of everything. Be good, Caroline, and wait a few more days. I'll get you a new one when the latest model is released."

Since he said that, it would seem odd if I insisted.

So, I nodded and said nothing more.

When we got home, Shirley and Paula were already sitting at the dining table, but their faces were red and swollen, and the atmosphere was very awkward. It was clear they had just fought.

I frowned. What was it about this time?

Brandon wasn't even home, so what caused the conflict between them?

And the most crucial part was that Shirley looked at Paula with obvious guilt in her eyes.

Shirley feeling guilty? Didn't she get James to deal with Paula? Could it be that she was found out?

Or did Paula also know the secret that Shirley knew? I bit my utensils, thoughtfully looking at Shirley.

After dinner, I quietly went to the coffee table in the living room and retrieved a bug from underneath.

This was something Kathy left for me the first time she came over. She thought I might need it someday, even if just to keep evidence.

I had left it there all this time, and it should have recorded Shirley and Paula's voices.

I glanced at Brandon, who was frowning at his phone, seemingly replying to someone's message.

Meanwhile, Shirley was playing with the kids on the couch, and Paula was washing dishes in the kitchen.

I got up and said to Brandon, "Brandon, I'm really tired today. I'm going to rest. Can Shirley take care of the kids for me for a day?"

Brandon put down his phone and looked at me gently: "Of course, you go rest. I'm here. Good night, Caroline."

I nodded and went upstairs.

After confirming that neither Shirley nor Brandon followed me, I hid in the bathroom and took out the recording device, pressing the play button.

At first, there was a rustling sound. I fast-forwarded, trying to find the recording of Shirley and Paula fighting.

But for a long time, there were just unclear sounds.

Just as I was about to give up, I suddenly heard Shirley's voice on the recording.

"Paula, when are you going to get out?"

"This isn't your house. Mr. Jordan and Mrs. Jordan want me to stay. What does it have to do with you?" That was Paula's voice.

Shirley spoke: "I'm warning you, get out quickly, or else."

Paula sneered: "How are you going to be unkind to me? Are you going to get James to deal with me?"

I was shocked. I didn't expect Paula to know about James. Did she find out or investigate?

Either way, Paula was even more cunning than I thought!

In the recording, Shirley was clearly as shocked as I was: "How do you know James came over? Did he tell you?"

Paula scoffed: "Of course. You came here a few years ago, and your first love, James, followed right after. What a coincidence, right?"

"James is so stupid. I just had to beckon, and he told me everything, including what you're up to."

"You're investigating someone named Elora, right? Did you know she had a child with Mr. Jordan?"

Shirley remained silent, and Paula's voice grew more arrogant: "Do you remember pushing me into the water when we were kids? You bullied me a lot growing up. I'm going to take everything from you."

"Brandon, and everything you have now, you don't deserve any of it."

Finally, Shirley couldn't hold back: "Do you know why? It's because our parents favored you when we were kids and gave me nothing. I had to get back at them this way. Blame them, not me!"

"You're lying. You're just selfish. You have no right to talk about our parents!"

Then there was a loud slap. I couldn't tell who hit whom. Paula's voice followed, incredulous: "You dare hit me?"

Shirley snorted: "So what if I hit you?"

Then the two started fighting, which explained the red and swollen faces I saw.

Suddenly, Paula shouted: "Shirley, don't think I don't know why you left your last nanny job!"

The fighting stopped, and the recording went silent. I even wondered if it was broken.

But then I heard Shirley's terrified voice: "How... how do you know?"

I immediately understood why Shirley felt guilty.

"How hard is it to find out? You were a nanny for a family, and their child went missing. They never found the child."

"Not long after, you resigned. Does that have nothing to do with you?"

"What evidence do you have? If you don't, shut your mouth."

Shirley's voice was loud, but it was clear she was bluffing.

Paula sneered: "Evidence? I found a child's bones in the backyard of our old house. Should I get the DNA tested?"

Shirley fell silent. Paula continued: "Should I tell the police the truth? That you tried to seduce the employer and, when you failed, took it out on the child? The child was only four years old, and you drugged and killed them."

"What do you want?"

"Keep your mouth shut. If you touch me again, I'll reveal this secret, and you'll go to jail!"

Shirley was clearly scared and didn't speak again. The rest of the recording was Paula's one-sided rant.

I paused the recording, feeling a chill.

If Shirley failed to seduce Brandon, would she take it out on my children? I didn't know!

But this was a consequence I couldn't bear. Even if Shirley hadn't acted yet, who could guarantee she wouldn't in the future?

Shirley was a lunatic. If she could harm a four-year-old, what else was she capable of?

I made up my mind. I had to get rid of Shirley and Paula, these two vicious sisters!

I pressed play again. After the fight, Shirley angrily called James.

"James? Did you tell Paula about my business?"

Her voice was accusatory.

"Paula is not my real sister. She doesn't deserve it! I问 you, are you involved with Paula?"

###chapter 39

Shirley's voice was hysterical and broken: "What do you mean, what's wrong?"

"Do you know that everything you have now is because of me? And you dare to betray me with my money! You bastard!"

She screamed into the phone.

I couldn't understand James's voice, but I could tell Shirley was getting more and more distraught.

"Fine, if you think Paula is so great, then get money from her from now on. I won't give you any more money. Let's see how you survive!"

"Just wait and see, James. Just wait!"

With that, Shirley hung up the phone and covered her face, crying in the living room.

But I only felt disgusted by her. She had caused the death of someone else's child, and she still had the nerve to cry?

I saved the recording, planning to continue recording under the coffee table tomorrow.

It seems I underestimated this device; it can still pick up some things.

After putting everything in place, I suddenly remembered that the children were still with Shirley. I was afraid she might take her anger out on my kids, so I quickly went downstairs to bring them up.

Brandon looked at me with a strange expression: "Weren't you asleep?"

I nodded: "I just thought of the kids and couldn't sleep. I'll take them upstairs to play."

With that, I took the kids upstairs.

They weren't very close to me yet, after all, they had been under Shirley's influence for a while. So I wasn't in a hurry; I could take my time.

I coaxed the two kids to sleep and slowly lay down to sleep myself.

But I had a nightmare, dreaming that Shirley had lost my kids, and I couldn't find them no matter how hard I tried.

In the end, I found them in a desolate place, lying in a pit.

"No, no, my children! My children!"

I woke up with a start, only to find Brandon sitting by my bed, looking at me. Seeing me wake up, he quickly comforted me: "It's okay, Caroline, you just had a nightmare."

Still shaken, I was held tightly in his arms, feeling even more disgusted. I would rather have nightmares than be close to Brandon.

Because he was my nightmare.

I quietly broke free from Brandon's embrace: "What are you doing here?"

It was already dark outside, so why wasn't Brandon in his room sleeping? Why was he here?

Could it be that he found out about the recording? But he shouldn't be reacting this way.

I quietly watched Brandon's next move.

"I was going back to my room when I heard you talking. I came in and found you talking in your sleep."

"Caroline, are you under too much pressure lately? If you don't want Shirley to take care of the kids, we can send one of them to my mom's place. That way, you won't have to worry so much."

I sneered. Send them to Karen's place? I'm afraid the kids would get depressed even faster.

"Don't give me that. If you're tired of it, just say so. I'll take the kids and move out."

"Have you forgotten how Karen treated us last time? She said Brett was ill-mannered. Who else should the toys be for if not Brett? Does she have other grandchildren?"

Brandon's eyes flickered, and he smiled: "She doesn't. I've already talked to her about it. She was wrong."

I sneered: "And you still dare to suggest sending the kids to her? You don't love your children."

Brandon immediately got anxious, frowning: "She only did that once. You don't have to say it like that."

I snorted: "I wasn't there, so who knows how she behaves? I'm telling you, I care a lot about that incident, and I'll never forget it!"

"If you bring it up again, we'll get a divorce!"

I said firmly.

Brandon was stunned. After all, this was the first time in our nearly ten-year marriage that I had mentioned divorce. He frowned deeply.

"Caroline, you..."

He thought I was just angry, but I meant every word.

I decided to say everything I had been holding back, or I might blurt it out in another nightmare: "And tell me, what's going on with the company?"

Brandon's eyes showed a hint of evasion: "Nothing's going on. You saw it yourself; it's running normally. What's the problem?"

I sneered: "There's a big problem. Why is Earl in the company?"

Brandon looked into my eyes and explained: "Earl graduated from college, so he came to our company to gain some experience. And he's doing well."

"Doing well?"

I asked mockingly: "Brandon, do you think I've lost my memory? I paid for Earl's college education. Someone like Earl, and you didn't find him a regular job but made him a manager in the company. What are you thinking?"

"Do you think the company is your family business? Have you forgotten that my dad founded it?"

"And now it's full of your family members. Just because I haven't said anything doesn't mean I don't have an opinion. You're filling the company with useless people to push me out?"

Brandon's face darkened immediately. After all, in all our years of marriage, I had never spoken to him like this.

"Useless people? Watch your words."

"Aren't they? Let's not even talk about Earl. How can someone like Irene be the CFO? She worked as a cashier in a supermarket for twenty years and never even did accounting!"

"And isn't she doing fine? The company is running normally. What are you arguing about? Do you want Asher back?"

He sneered: "Let me tell you, Asher will never come back after cooking the books. Am I wrong to put my family in charge to avoid another incident?"

When he mentioned Asher, a hint of malice flashed in Brandon's eyes. I suddenly realized why even Simon couldn't find Asher's whereabouts. Could it be related to Brandon?

I glared at Brandon, and he looked back at me with a sinister expression, as if he was about to reveal his true nature.

Brandon had never shown this side of himself in front of me. It seemed he couldn't hold back this time.

"Last time I went to check the accounts, Irene wouldn't let me. What can she do?"

Brandon didn't dare to touch me now, given the old house issue. He was afraid of my death and wanted to keep me safe.

Sure enough, after a while, Brandon gave in, lowered his head, and admitted his mistake.

"I'm sorry, Caroline. After Asher's betrayal, I don't trust anyone else. And I'm in control of the company's direction, so there's no problem. Don't worry."

"Aunt Asher didn't let you check the accounts because she didn't want you to tire yourself. She had no other intentions."

"When you're better, you can return to the company anytime."

###chapter 40

Brandon's hidden meaning in his words was that I wouldn't get better and would never return to the company.

Of course, he thought I didn't catch on.

I appropriately threw a tantrum to make Brandon not suspicious of what I was doing.

And now I pretended to be appeased: "Really?"

Brandon nodded: "Of course, Caroline, I've been waiting for you to come back to the company. You don't know how tiring it is to do everything by myself."

He appropriately mentioned his difficulties.

I watched him act and then nodded: "Alright, I understand your difficulties."

Brandon then patted my head: "Caroline, you should sleep. If you need anything, just call me."

With that, he left the room.

After watching his back as he walked out, I waited for another half hour, then quietly opened the door to check.

After confirming that it was really quiet outside, I went to the bathroom and took out my phone to call Simon.

Sure enough, he wasn't asleep and quickly answered my call: "Hello, Caroline?"

"Yes, it's me. I want to ask you to look into someone named Asher."

Simon was silent for a moment and then said, "Asher is currently missing. To be honest, if the person I'm looking for is alive, I can find them, unless..."

He's already dead.

I immediately understood what Simon meant, and my hand went limp, causing the phone to drop to the ground.

"Caroline? What's going on?"

I quickly picked up the phone from the ground and said, "I'm fine, my hand just shook."

"Please, help me find out about Asher. He's very important to me."

"Asher and I grew up together. After graduation, he came to the company to help me. Without him, I couldn't have kept the company going after my dad passed away. He did me a great favor, so please, you must help me find him!"

Simon pondered for a moment and agreed: "Alright, but don't overthink it. If I can't find him, it might be because someone else has him locked up. He might still be alive."

"Okay."

I knew Simon was trying to comfort me, so I responded softly and then hung up the phone.

If Asher was really killed by them, I wouldn't know how to face Asher's parents. It was my fault; I shouldn't have dragged Asher into this, making him a target for Brandon and the Jordan family, those demons.

I suddenly felt nauseous and bent over the toilet to vomit.

But all I could throw up was some bile. I hadn't eaten much that night, so my stomach was empty and aching.

They say the stomach is an emotional organ. When I'm sad, it gets sad with me.

I weakly flushed the toilet and went back to bed, lying there with my mind racing about what to do.

Sometimes I feel powerless because I think I'm not facing a group of people but a pack of mindless beasts.

They open their foul-smelling mouths, showing their bloody fangs, looking for prey.

How can a person fight against these human-faced beasts?

I sighed and tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep.

At dawn, I got up early to prepare to take Brett to school.

Brandon also got up to go to work. Seeing the car keys in my hand, he reached out to take them.

"I'll take Brett. You should rest at home."

I reflexively stepped back and took Brett with me: "The company and Brett's school are in opposite directions. I'll go."

Now, just seeing Brandon's face fills me with fear, always feeling like there's nothing he wouldn't do!

Ignoring Brandon's strange look, I took Brett and left.

After successfully dropping him off at school, I breathed a sigh of relief. But I had another important task.

I went to Kathy's studio to find her.

She studied fashion design in college, and after graduation, Gerald invested in her to become the head of a high-end brand.

That's why Kathy was so angry about Brandon's family taking over our company. Gerald treated her like a daughter, and she wouldn't allow Brandon to do this.

Kathy's eyes lit up when she saw me: "What's going on with you today? You can go out?"

I slowly shook my head: "I just came out for a breath of fresh air and wanted to ask you for a favor. If I'm late getting back, Shirley will probably call Brandon to report."

Kathy's eyes were full of sympathy: "Tell me, I'll help with anything."

"Can you help me buy a mini camera? I discovered a secret about Shirley. She killed her previous employer's daughter, and I'm afraid she'll harm my children."

Kathy's eyes widened in shock. She knew this was important and quickly nodded: "Alright, don't worry. I'll buy it now, and you can pick it up tomorrow."

I nodded and thanked her: "Without you, I wouldn't know what to do now. Thank you so much, Kathy."

Kathy waved her hand: "It's nothing. With our relationship, you can come to me for anything."

I couldn't stay long, so after saying goodbye to Kathy, I drove back home.

Sure enough, Shirley was sitting in the living room. Seeing me return, she casually asked, "Mrs. Jordan, why did you take so long?"

I knew that wherever I drove, they would know, so I decided to tell the truth: "I went to see Kathy. I haven't seen her in days and missed her."

Hearing this, Shirley nodded: "Mrs. Jordan, maybe I should take Brett to school from now on. Your health is so poor, what if something happens?"

Of course, I wouldn't allow her to be alone with my children. Who knows what she might do?

I shook my head and refused: "I can still use this time to get some fresh air. Otherwise, staying at home all day is too stifling and not good for my recovery."

Hearing this, Shirley glanced at me with a meaningful look: "Mrs. Jordan, why do I feel like you look much better? You've even gained some weight."

I knew she was telling the truth, which was the result of my efforts over the past few days.

But I still shook my head: "You must be mistaken. I used to feel sleepy every day, but now I can't sleep at all. If anything, I'm just restless in bed and have to get up."

Shirley nodded and said nothing.

In the evening, after bringing Brett back, Brandon also returned, while Paula stayed at the company to work late.

After dinner, I went upstairs to watch Brett do his homework, leaving only Shirley and Brandon downstairs.

I had a feeling they might say something, so I waited until it was late and quiet, then prepared to go downstairs.

Just as I was about to take the recorder from under the coffee table, I heard a voice: "Mrs. Jordan, what are you doing?"

The living room lights came on, and I saw Paula, who had just returned home, looking at me.

I turned my hand towards the medical box under the coffee table: "My stomach is uncomfortable. The food I ate tonight didn't digest well, so I came to get some medicine."

###chapter 41

Paula, after all, didn't take on the task of monitoring me every day for Brandon, nor did she suspect much.

"Mrs. Jordan, why don't you turn on the light?"

"It's just a few steps, I thought I could see."

Paula didn't say anything, put down her bag, and went back to her room.

After she left, I looked around to make sure no one was there, then reached out to pick up the voice recorder and went back to my room.

Locking the door, I went into the bathroom and pressed the play button.

As usual, I skipped the noise at the beginning and indeed heard Shirley and Brandon talking.

"Mr. Jordan, Mrs. Jordan went to see Kathy today."

Brandon's voice was low: "I know, I put a tracker in the car. Did she say what she was going to do?"

I was startled; it seemed telling the truth this morning was the right choice. If I had lied, Brandon would have immediately suspected me.

Shirley replied, "She said she hadn't seen Kathy in a long time, and since it was on the way to the school, she decided to visit."

I didn't lie about that; Kathy's studio is indeed not far from Brett's school.

Sure enough, Brandon responded with a low "hmm": "Keep monitoring her. If she comes back late, call me immediately."

There was a period of silence, and I thought they had stopped talking, but then Shirley's voice suddenly came up again.

"Mr. Jordan, is Mrs. Jordan's health starting to improve? Why are you doing this? Don't you want her to die?"

"If that's the case, what was all our previous effort for? Or are you having second thoughts?"

Shirley's questions made the recorder go silent, followed by Brandon's cold laugh: "What does it have to do with you? I'm just asking you to keep an eye on her. Are you worrying too much, Shirley?"

Shirley's voice was filled with resentment: "You're regretting it, aren't you? Otherwise, give me an explanation! Have all my efforts for you been in vain? And have you slept with Paula? She's not a good woman at all, you..."

There was a slap sound, presumably Brandon hitting Shirley.

After all, I didn't believe Shirley had the courage to hit Brandon.

"Shut up. What does it matter to you what I do? Just do your job."

"You know I don't like meddlesome women. If you keep this up, I won't hesitate to replace you."

Shirley didn't speak for a long time, and then there were footsteps, indicating Brandon had left.

The recording ended there. It seemed Shirley silently accepted the result, but she probably had another secret about Brandon that I hadn't heard.

It looked like I would have to plan for the long term.

I put away the voice recorder and lay down to sleep.

The next morning, just as I was about to take Brett to school again, Brandon suddenly suggested going with me.

I wanted to use the same excuse as yesterday, but he suddenly put his arm around my shoulder: "Didn't you say Brett would be very happy to see both of us taking him to school?"

I couldn't refuse this reason, as it was something I had said myself.

I had to nod in agreement.

After taking Brett to school, Brandon planned to drive back to the company, but before that, he dropped me off at home.

I remembered what Shirley had said to him, and it seemed Brandon wanted to prevent me from visiting Kathy again.

I had no choice but to go back to my room and text Kathy the reason I couldn't go today. She quickly replied: "Wait, I'll come to see you tonight."

I was stunned by Kathy's reply, but at that moment, I couldn't stay in the bathroom any longer and had to wait for Kathy's arrival.

In the evening, when Brandon came back with Brett, Kathy knocked on the door.

"Caroline, open the door for me."

As soon as I opened the door, I saw Caroline carrying large bags into the house, which made Brandon look puzzled.

"What are you doing?"

Kathy rolled her eyes at Brandon: "What do you think?"

She brought the bags to me: "Didn't you ask me to help you buy some dresses yesterday? Since you didn't come today, I had to go shopping myself. I brought the things back according to your taste. See if you like them."

I immediately understood Kathy's intention and quickly nodded: "I was planning to pick them up from you tomorrow."

I casually picked up a dress and saw a miniature camera in the pocket.

I pretended to admire it and slipped the camera into my pocket while Kathy stood in front of me, busy taking out the clothes.

Her actions attracted everyone's attention in the room, so no one saw what I was doing.

Kathy took out the clothes and extended her hand to Brandon: "Mr. Jordan, these are Caroline's things. Are you going to pay by transfer or card?"

I wasn't sure if Brandon had stopped suspecting me, but he did look a bit exasperated: "I'll transfer the money to you. How much?"

"Ten thousand dollars, transfer it to me."

Brandon nodded and transferred the money to Kathy without hesitation: "Is that all right now? Ms. Patel, would you like to stay for dinner?"

"No, thanks. I have things to do. Caroline, take your time trying them on. If they don't fit, you can return them."

I nodded and walked Kathy to the door.

She winked at me and whispered so only I could hear: "The manual is sewn into the lining of the dress. You can assemble it yourself."

I gave her a grateful look and glanced back at Brandon and Shirley.

Shirley was rummaging through the pile of things, seemingly trying to find something.

I saw Kathy off and walked back to Shirley's side.

"Are you done?"

Shirley looked up with an awkward smile: "I just haven't seen such nice things before, so I was curious."

She glanced at Brandon and shook her head slightly.

Confirming she hadn't found anything, I breathed a sigh of relief and sneered: "What, weren't you suspecting Kathy of bringing me something and trying to find it?"

I looked at Brandon: "Do you suspect me?"

I confronted Brandon directly: "What do you mean?"

"I've noticed for a while now that you have Shirley watching me, not letting me go out, taking my phone, and now going through the things Kathy brought me."

"Brandon, what do you mean?"

Seeing that I was really angry, Brandon's expression changed, and he came forward to comfort me: "Caroline, why would you think that?"

"I genuinely care about you. I've never had any ill intentions towards you, and your health is improving because of the medicine I gave you, isn't it?"

I rolled my eyes. Brandon really dared to say that. If I hadn't switched the medicine with the antidote, how would my health have gradually improved? Otherwise, I would still be in a deep sleep like before.

And so, we slowly waited for the urban renewal funds for my family's old house to come through.

###chapter 42

Seeing that I didn't say anything, Brandon hugged me and comforted me, "Caroline, I love you so much, how could I harm you? I'm just worried about you."

Shirley looked at Brandon holding me, a hint of jealousy flashing in her eyes.

I looked at Brandon, "Really?"

Brandon nodded, his eyes showing a bit of grievance, "Caroline, how could you doubt me? I'm really hurt."

I looked at him, "Then give me back my phone. I can't continue like this. I don't know anything about the outside world."

Brandon's eyes flickered, but his smile remained unchanged, "Alright, I'll buy you the latest phone tomorrow."

I nodded, just about to take the things Kathy bought for me back to my room, but Brandon followed me.

"Caroline, you were sick before, so we slept in separate rooms. Now that you're getting better, why don't we sleep together?"

With a crash, the cup in Shirley's hand fell to the ground and shattered.

Brandon glanced back at Shirley, his eyes dark, "Be careful."

Shirley nodded and went to clean up.

Brandon turned back to me, reaching out to hold my hand, "Can we, Caroline? We've been sleeping in separate rooms for a long time. Why don't we sleep together?"

I felt extremely disgusted, but I knew I couldn't refuse this reason.

So I nodded, "Alright, if you want to, but the two kids will sleep with me. They're very noisy, can you handle that?"

Brandon laughed, "If you can handle it, why can't I? Don't forget, I'm also their father."

With that, I couldn't say anything more.

"Then you can pack up and move over. I'm used to this room and don't want to move."

Most importantly, I didn't want to sleep in the bed Brandon had shared with other women.

Brandon agreed, and I returned to my room.

Time was limited, and I had to quickly install the hidden camera.

I opened the door and said, "I'm going to take a nap. Don't disturb me."

Then I locked the door and searched through the clothes Kathy had brought me.

I found the instructions Kathy had sewn into the lining of a dress.

Following the instructions, I assembled the miniature camera and hid it in a corner of the room.

Then I unlocked the door, fed the kids, and fell asleep.

When I woke up, Brandon was already lying next to me, breathing evenly.

I was startled for a moment, then remembered he had said he would move in.

I glanced at the miniature camera, suppressed my disgust, and went back to sleep.

The next night, Brandon brought me a new phone when he came back.

"Caroline, a gift for you."

It seemed Brandon hadn't broken his promise this time; he really brought me the phone.

I took it and thanked him, but I had a feeling it wasn't that simple.

Sure enough, upon close inspection, I noticed the phone's seal had been tampered with, something you wouldn't notice unless you looked carefully.

I was sure Brandon had done something to the phone.

After Brandon fell asleep, I got up and went to the bathroom, took out my old phone, and texted Simon and Kathy, telling them about Brandon suddenly moving into my room.

I also texted Simon about the phone and asked him to find an expert to check it.

Simon quickly replied, "Sure, see you at the usual place tomorrow."

I knew he meant the members-only restaurant.

The next day, after dropping Brett off at school, Brandon offered to drive me home. I quickly said, "Brandon, I haven't had a meal with Kathy in a long time. Can I go have lunch with her?"

Brandon smiled gently, "Sure, I'll go with you."

My heart sank. Brandon was determined to follow me.

As I was thinking of how to refuse him, Brandon's phone rang.

The caller's name was Kingsley, just a last name, but the only Kingsley around Brandon was Elora.

Brandon glanced at me, then answered the call impatiently, "What is it?"

"I told you I don't have time."

Brandon was also impatient with Elora. Had something happened between them?

I didn't know what was said on the other end, but Brandon frowned, "Wait for me, I'll be there soon."

He hung up and apologized, "Sorry, Caroline, I can't go with you this time. There's a problem with the supplier. Come home early, and I'll have the driver pick you up."

I was overjoyed, feeling like God was helping me, but I kept a calm face and nodded, "Alright, you go ahead."

After Brandon drove off, I took a cab to the place Kathy had mentioned and found the private room we used last time.

Opening the door, I saw Simon and Kathy waiting inside.

I couldn't help but complain, "Brandon has been acting like a lunatic these days, watching me constantly. Does he suspect something?"

Simon shook his head, "Hard to say, but we should reduce contact for now to avoid suspicion."

That was exactly what I wanted to say.

I handed the phone to Simon, who took out some tools from his bag and started disassembling it.

I was surprised and looked at Kathy, who shrugged, indicating she didn't know Simon had this skill either.

Simon seemed to know what we were thinking and looked up, "I took a mechanical engineering elective in college."

I almost applauded him. Simon was truly a versatile person.

Simon opened the phone's motherboard and, after a quick glance, confirmed, "There's a signal interceptor in the phone."

"In simple terms, Brandon has another phone connected to this one. Whatever you do on this phone, he can see."

I was stunned. As expected, Brandon wouldn't just let me have the phone.

"What should I do?" I looked at Simon, "It would be strange if I didn't use the phone Brandon gave me, but using it is like carrying a piece of iron."

Simon shook his head, took out another device from his bag, and attached it to the motherboard.

Then he produced a miniature soldering iron and started working.

Kathy and I couldn't understand his actions.

After a while, he reassembled the phone and handed it to me.

"There's a switch inside the phone. When you turn it on, Brandon can't see your phone's content. When it's off, everything is normal."

I couldn't help but admire him, "You're amazing!"

Kathy also clapped, "Thank goodness you're not on Brandon's side, or Caroline and I would never have solved this."

###chapter 43

Simon's skills are undeniable. He handed the phone back to me.

It looked exactly the same as the one Brandon gave me, without any signs of tampering.

He walked behind me and showed me how to use the phone.

"There's a switch here. If you turn it off, Brandon can see what you're doing on the phone. If you turn it on, he can't see anything."

I thanked him repeatedly, feeling a rare sense of relaxation.

Now, even if I do something around Brandon, he won't notice at all.

The three of us had a rare chat, and then Kathy suddenly picked up her phone and said she had to leave, leaving just Simon and me in the room.

He said, "Oh, I forgot to tell you, I've already found the person to be placed in your family's company. He should be able to get in soon."

My eyes lit up. "Really?"

Simon's efficiency was impressive; it had only been a few days, and he had already taken care of it.

I naturally expressed my gratitude, but he waved it off. "No problem, it was easy for me."

Suddenly, he turned serious. "By the way, I still haven't found any information on Asher. I'm planning to send someone to Asher's hometown to ask around. It's impossible for an adult like Asher to just vanish into thin air."

I nodded, already prepared for this. "Thank you. Let me know if anything comes up."

We didn't talk for long before Brandon called, urging me to come home. I called the driver to pick me up.

When I got home, I connected the micro camera to my phone so I could see the surveillance footage.

Of course, I blocked Brandon's phone while doing all this.

That night, Brandon came home, looking very impatient as he talked on the phone.

"What do you want?"

"Alright, I know. I'll come over when I have time."

"Stop bothering me."

I've seen him with this expression a lot lately. As far as I know, Brandon never shows this face to the Jordan family or business partners. Could it be Elora? Are they having a fight?

"Brandon, you seem really annoyed these days. Who's on the other end?"

Brandon avoided eye contact. "It's just Earl. He can't handle a minor issue and needs my help."

I was sure Brandon was lying. I needed to find a way to check his phone and see what was going on.

That night, I gave Brandon a glass of milk, which I had spiked with something.

"Brandon, you seem really tired lately. Have some milk and get some rest."

Brandon saw me, took off his glasses, and rubbed his nose.

"I'm not tired, Caroline. I need to work hard for you and the kids."

He said that, but he still drank the milk in one gulp.

"Caroline, you go to bed first. I'll join you after I shower."

I nodded and went to bed, pretending to sleep.

Half an hour later, Brandon came back from his shower and collapsed on the other side of the bed.

I pretended to be asleep, breathing evenly.

Brandon looked at me several times and called, "Caroline? Caroline?"

Seeing I didn't respond, he thought I was asleep and continued looking at his phone.

I lay with my back to him, eyes open, feeling the light from his phone.

Brandon seemed to be typing and chatting with someone, occasionally laughing.

Soon, the drug took effect, and Brandon put down his phone and fell into a deep sleep.

I didn't hesitate to take his phone and unlock it with his fingerprint.

The screen lit up, making me squint. Once my eyes adjusted, I saw the hidden system on his phone.

Brandon must have been really tired; he didn't even switch to the other system.

I opened the chat app to see who he was talking to.

The app had all sorts of people, but I immediately noticed a woman with a rose as her profile picture at the top.

I opened the chat and saw their conversation was very explicit.

The language was extremely suggestive, making me feel like I could catch a disease just by reading it.

I forced myself to read through it and found out it wasn't Elora but another unknown woman.

Their chat history showed they started talking a few days ago, which was when Brandon began to be impatient with Elora.

Could it be that Brandon was acting this way because of this woman?

I quickly skimmed through, confirming there was no important information, and exited the chat.

I felt like my eyes might get infected if I looked any longer.

I then opened his chat with Elora, which was empty except for a vague message from Brandon: "Study."

Was there a secret in the study?

It was already late, and everyone was asleep, so I decided to go to the study and check.

The study was on the same floor as my room. I walked over, opened the door, and started searching.

I even checked the cabinets at the back.

But I didn't notice a pair of eyes peeking through the slightly open door.

She suddenly spoke in a ghostly voice, "Mrs. Jordan, what are you looking for?"

I was startled and looked up immediately.

Shirley was standing at the door, watching me.

"You're just in time. Help me find a pen. I need it for tomorrow morning."

"A pen?"

Shirley looked puzzled, not understanding why I was looking for a pen so late.

I nodded, looking at her seriously. "Brandon hasn't been feeling well lately. I saw a soup recipe on my phone and wanted to write it down to buy the ingredients, but I couldn't find a pen."

Shirley didn't say anything, still looking suspicious.

She walked over, found a pen in the drawer, and handed it to me.

"Here, Mrs. Jordan."

"Oh!" I pretended to be surprised. "Great, don't tell Brandon. I want to surprise him."

With that, I happily took the pen and left, my face turning serious as soon as I was out the door.

How long had Shirley been watching me? She could even follow me this late. Brandon must be keeping a close watch on me.

I took the pen back to the room. Brandon was still asleep.

I randomly found a soup recipe on my phone and wrote it down, leaving the pen on the bedside table.

I didn't know if my excuse had dispelled Shirley's suspicion or if she would report to Brandon.

But I had no other choice for now. I had to wait and see what happened next.

The next morning, Brandon got up early while I stayed in bed, pretending to sleep.

I watched as Shirley came in, pointed at me, and whispered something to Brandon.

Brandon listened and then looked back at me.

###chapter 44

"Are you sure she went through it?"

Shirley nodded, "I saw Mrs. Jordan go upstairs last night, so I followed her. She said she was going to make soup for you but couldn't find a pen to write the recipe."

Because they were speaking softly, I could only hear these two sentences.

I couldn't help but grit my teeth. Shirley, just you wait. One day, I'll kick you out.

Brandon nodded to show he understood. After Shirley left, he turned back and looked at me cautiously.

I pretended to be sound asleep.

Suddenly, he walked to my bedside and picked up something from the nightstand.

I guessed he picked up the pen and looked at it, then gently put it back on the nightstand.

He patted me lightly, "Caroline, wake up. Aren't you going to see Brett off today?"

I pretended to be half-awake and looked at him, "You go, Brandon. I didn't sleep well last night."

I didn't know what expression Brandon had on his face, but he asked in a low voice, "Why didn't you sleep well?"

The moment Shirley discovered me yesterday, I had decided to tell the truth.

After all, I expected Shirley to betray me.

"Yesterday, Shirley startled me, and I couldn't sleep for a long time after that."

After I said that, Brandon didn't say anything more, and I pretended to be very sleepy and continued to sleep.

But I was indeed tired, as I really hadn't slept well last night.

Soon, I fell asleep for real and didn't even know when Brandon left.

When I woke up, it was almost noon. The soup recipe I wrote last night was still on the nightstand. I picked it up and prepared to go out.

Shirley saw me heading out and quickly chased after me, asking, "Mrs. Jordan, where are you going?"

I gave her a reproachful look, "Didn't I tell you yesterday? I'm going to buy some groceries to make soup for Brandon."

Shirley nodded and didn't say anything else.

Since I had already told this lie, I had to make it believable, or it would definitely arouse Brandon's suspicion.

After buying groceries at the market, I spent the entire afternoon in the kitchen following the recipe I wrote last night. Finally, by the time Brandon came home in the evening, the soup was ready.

I covered his eyes excitedly and said, "Brandon, guess what surprise I prepared for you?"

I didn't know if Brandon's suspicion had lessened, but he played along with me.

"I don't know, Caroline. What did you prepare?"

I removed my hands, letting him see the soup I had prepared on the table.

"I noticed you've been on the phone a lot lately, and you always seem in a bad mood afterward. So I specifically learned this soup recipe. Try it and see if it's good."

Brandon's eyes flashed with a strange emotion, and he smiled and nodded, "Sure, I'll try your cooking."

He sat at the table, and Shirley served him the soup. After taking a sip, he began to praise, "Caroline, this soup is really good, just as good as a five-star hotel."

I knew he was acting, so I played along, "Is it good? I saw the recipe in the bathroom last night and quickly wrote it down. But I found out we didn't have a single pen in the house, so I had to go to your study to find one, and Shirley startled me."

Brandon's expression didn't change as he took another sip of the soup, "Really? I'll ask Shirley to buy more pens for the house so you won't have trouble finding one next time."

After dinner, I knew Brandon's suspicion hadn't lessened because he only drank the one bowl of soup Shirley served him. He didn't drink much at all.

I looked at the large pot of soup and couldn't help but feel heartbroken. All those good ingredients wasted.

Although Brandon was suspicious of me, he didn't do anything, and I got up the next day as usual to take Brett to school.

Brandon and I sat in the back seat, and at that moment, I received a call from Kathy.

"Caroline, there's a party. Are you coming?"

Since I was 'diagnosed with an illness,' I hadn't attended any charity parties. One reason was my health, and the other was that I had been so tormented that I didn't want to go out.

"I think I'll skip it."

"Elora will be there too." I glanced at Brandon, making sure he didn't hear what Kathy said, and nodded, "Okay, send me the details, and we'll meet up."

I hung up the phone, and Brandon opened his eyes, "Who was that?"

"Kathy. She wants me to attend a charity party. She said our group of friends hasn't seen me in a long time. I wasn't planning to go, but she insisted."

Brandon frowned, "But your health?"

I shook my head, "I'm fine. I was busy in the kitchen all afternoon yesterday and didn't feel tired. I should be able to attend."

With that, Brandon had nothing more to say, but he did remind me, "Be careful."

"By the way, you should see less of Kathy. I feel like she doesn't care about your health."

I sneered inwardly. If Kathy doesn't care about my health, who does? You?

If it weren't for you, my health wouldn't be like this.

But I didn't say that. Instead, I frowned at him, "What do you mean? I don't have many friends, only Kathy. What do you mean by telling me to stay away from her?"

Seeing that I was angry, Brandon suddenly laughed, "You misunderstood me. I meant your health hasn't fully recovered. If you keep going out with her, what if your condition worsens? Why not wait until you're fully recovered, and then you can go out as much as you want."

I didn't say anything, and he hugged me and coaxed, "Caroline, I'm going to work now. Don't be mad at me. Let's say I misspoke, okay?"

I watched Brandon walk out of the car and couldn't help but sneer.

It's all an excuse. He's just afraid Kathy will tell me the truth, but I already know.

A few days later, Kathy sent me the party invitation and asked me to meet her at her studio.

Although I was puzzled, I went anyway.

At Kathy's studio, several stylists were ready. When they saw me, Kathy eagerly sat me down in a chair.

"Today, you don't have to do anything else. Just make my good friend look beautiful."

Seeing Kathy's smug smile, I couldn't help but smile too. It seemed Kathy really understood me.

I had been worried about how to present myself at the party, and Kathy's approach was exactly what I liked.

I never liked showing my vulnerability to others. If I appeared at the party looking haggard, not only would others look down on me, but I would also look down on myself.

After the makeover, I couldn't help but marvel at the stylists' skills.

They had transformed me from a haggard, low-spirited person into a wealthy young lady.

Kathy looked at me with satisfaction and took me to the inner part of her studio.

###chapter 45

"Pick whatever you like, it's on me today."

You should know that a custom dress from Kathy is not cheap, yet she just said she would give it to me.

Seeing the look in my eyes, Kathy smiled smugly, "What? Have you fallen in love with me?"

I nodded and said, rare for me to be so cheesy, "I love you the most."

Kathy immediately showed a look of disdain, "Come on, I just gave you a dress. If I give you something else in the future, will you give me your house?"

We both laughed happily, feeling that it had been a long time since we had such a relaxed time.

I changed into the evening dress Kathy prepared for me and then grabbed a bag from her wardrobe.

Since I married Brandon, I haven't bought a bag, always thinking not to put pressure on Brandon.

But I didn't expect Brandon to vent all this pressure on other women.

I changed my clothes, grabbed the bag, and made a dazzling entrance at the charity gala.

The organizer of this gala was a wealthy young lady named Joanna Thorne, whose father worked in the government, so many people came to support the event.

Similarly, the gala was held on a grand scale, and I even saw a few celebrities making appearances.

Of course, I wasn't interested in the celebrities; the only person I was interested in at the entire gala was Elora. I wondered in what capacity she would attend.

Before everyone arrived, Kathy took me to socialize with Joanna.

She raised her glass to me, "I heard from Kathy that you were sick. No wonder I haven't seen you for a long time."

Joanna and Kathy met at her custom studio. Kathy's studio was popular among these wealthy young ladies because of its exquisite designs and uniqueness.

Over time, Kathy became friends with them.

I nodded, "I was indeed sick, but I'm much better now."

Kathy snorted, as she was the only one present who knew the truth about my illness, feeling indignant.

Joanna glanced at me and smiled, "You look fine now, not as seriously ill as the rumors said."

I neither confirmed nor denied, "It was like that before."

Kathy rolled her eyes, "You should have seen her before, pale face, hair like straw. I almost thought I wouldn't see her again."

I didn't say anything, just nodded and smiled.

"You should be quite happy at this gala. I even sent an invitation to Brandon's mother, Karen. She should be here today."

I remembered the last time I went to Karen's house, and she was yelling at Brett.

I guessed Karen and Elora would show up together today. I wanted to see how they would make their entrance, holding hands?

After the small talk, I looked towards the entrance with a sense of anticipation.

Sure enough, after a while, Karen came in arm-in-arm with Elora.

Since the Jordan family latched onto our family and crossed social classes, Karen loved attending these events. It was partly to gain knowledge and partly to curry favor with the powerful, trying to elevate the Jordan family beyond the shadow of the Sharp family.

The two of them clearly didn't see me. They walked confidently, greeting everyone.

But due to their low profile, they were snubbed everywhere and eventually walked towards us.

"Ms. Thorne, I heard you are the organizer?" Karen said with a flattering smile, "I and my..."

Before she could finish, she saw me behind Joanna, and her expression was as if she had seen a ghost.

"You... you?"

Elora, who was holding Karen's arm, quickly withdrew her hand when she saw my face, looking at me in disbelief.

I knew what they were thinking. The last time they saw me, I was so haggard. How could I suddenly look so radiant in just a few days?

Joanna looked at Elora, then at me, with a knowing expression, "Ms. Sinclair, this is my friend Caroline. I believe you know each other?"

Karen's face was awkward, to say the least. She forced a nod, "Yes, we know each other."

"She is my husband Brandon's mother, right, Mom?" I said, stepping forward and taking Karen's arm.

Karen smiled and nodded, but her expression was worse than crying.

Elora, who had been standing behind, suddenly spoke up, "Caroline, I didn't expect to see you here."

"Ms. Sinclair and I are neighbors. We came to this gala together. I thought you wouldn't come because of your health, but I didn't expect you to recover so quickly."

Elora was indeed good with words, making her statement flawless.

"It's all thanks to the makeup artist Kathy found for me. Otherwise, I would look scary without makeup."

I laughed along.

"Caroline, you had invited me to dinner before, but I was always busy. It's such a coincidence to meet you here!"

I smiled lightly. Of course, it was a coincidence. I was deliberately waiting for you.

As Elora and I engaged in our fake socializing, I overheard people nearby whispering.

"Hey, how did these two end up together? Are they relatives?"

"Why do you say that?"

"I remember Caroline married Brandon, and after she had a child, she got sick and never came out again."

"Recently, Brandon's mother, Karen, has been attending these events with Elora, saying she is her son's wife."

"But I haven't heard that Brandon has any brothers. Did you get it wrong?"

I heard their conversation clearly, but Elora and Karen didn't hear a thing.

My good hearing was thanks to Brandon and his family. If they hadn't kept me in a dark room for years, my hearing wouldn't be this sharp.

Of course, Kathy and Joanna, who were closer to those people, also heard the conversation.

Kathy was already furious, wanting to hit Elora, but Joanna held her back, telling her to calm down.

Kathy, though restrained, still glared at Elora fiercely.

Joanna watched the drama between Elora and me with great interest.

I looked at Karen, "Mom, the toy you said Brett couldn't play with last time, was it for Elora's child, Jason? What a coincidence?"

Elora and Karen exchanged a guilty look.

Karen coughed lightly, her face showing a hint of accusation, "What else? You rarely come back. Elora is my neighbor and brings Jason to keep me company. Who else would I give the toy to?"

I sneered, "Mom, you should have said so. From now on, I'll bring Brett home every day. How would I know you miss them if you don't say anything?"

As soon as I said this, both Elora and Karen's faces changed.

###chapter 46

Karen, seeing that she couldn't out-argue me, glared at me and said, "You should just stay home and get better. Stop bothering Brandon. Didn't he have to pick you up and bring you home?"

At that moment, Joanna walked over with Kathy in tow. "Ms. Sinclair, I only sent you an invitation today because of Ms. Sharp. What do you mean by that? Are you looking down on my guests?"

Karen's face turned pale. She certainly didn't dare to offend Joanna and quickly shook her head. "No, no, I wouldn't dare."

As soon as Joanna arrived, the other young ladies at the party gathered around. After all, if they could win Joanna's favor and get close to the Thorne family, it would be a solid backing.

With more people around, someone recognized that Karen often brought Elora to such events and pointed at Elora, asking, "Didn't you say she was your son's wife? I see Caroline is here too. Do you have another son?"

Karen's face stiffened, and she quickly said, "She's my godson's wife. I'm close to her husband, so I took him as my godson. That makes Elora my junior."

Sweat appeared on her face as she let out a deep breath.

But her explanation didn't satisfy the curious crowd. "I see Caroline is doing well. Why didn't you bring Caroline and instead brought Elora? Are you playing favorites?"

Elora quickly waved her hands. "No, Ms. Sinclair didn't know Caroline was better, so she brought me."

"That makes it even worse. She doesn't even know how Caroline is doing. What kind of elder is she?"

Karen's face turned various shades of blue and purple, looking very embarrassed.

She glared at me fiercely, signaling me to speak up and explain the situation for her.

I shrugged, with an expression that said, "What does this have to do with me?"

Karen seemed about to explode with anger. But since she didn't know the identities of the people in front of her and was afraid of offending them, she had to hold back.

"Brandon usually takes care of her, so I don't go over. Naturally, I don't know about her condition. This time, I ran into Elora before coming here. Since she has children and we're close, I brought her along."

Joanna's eyes were full of mockery. "Does Mr. Jordan know about this? I bet you didn't discuss it with him."

Karen and Elora both looked guilty. They hadn't told Brandon about coming here openly this time.

Karen had thought it would be like before, where she brought Elora to show her face and then quietly left. But unexpectedly, she ran into me, making the situation awkward.

At that moment, someone said, "Who knows? Maybe Brandon allowed it. What if..."

Elora glanced at me and quickly explained, "No, everyone, I have nothing to do with Mr. Jordan. I used to work with Caroline, and after she left the company, I worked with Mr. Jordan. But I resigned after two years. I respect both of them very much, so please don't misunderstand."

Kathy crossed her arms and sneered, "What did we say? Why are you explaining so much? Are you feeling guilty?"

Elora bit her lip and said nothing. I suddenly spoke up, "Everyone really misunderstood. Elora has nothing to do with my husband Brandon. What she said is true."

"I didn't tell them about my recovery because my condition is unstable. If it worsens again, it would be a false hope. So it's not their fault; it's mine for not saying anything."

After I explained, Karen breathed a sigh of relief. "Exactly, it's Caroline's fault for not telling us anything. She was afraid I'd worry."

I smirked coldly. Karen was really good at making excuses for herself.

Kathy crossed her arms and looked at the two of them. "You two are explaining so much but not getting to the point. Who knows if there's something going on?"

Karen glared at Kathy but said nothing.

She could only force a smile and say, "Elora hasn't seen much of the world, coming from the countryside, so I brought her out to see."

"Caroline has seen these kinds of events since she was young, so she probably doesn't want to come anymore. That's why I didn't call her."

Her words elevated me but seemed to degrade Elora to the ground.

Elora's face turned extremely unpleasant, but she couldn't say anything and could only force a smile.

After all, she thought she had become Brandon's fiancée and crossed social classes, so she dared to appear at such events without any psychological burden.

But Karen had just shattered her facade, making it awkward for anyone.

Joanna suddenly spoke up, "Alright, since there's nothing going on, let's disperse. But Ms. Kingsley, we need to bring something for the charity auction. Did you bring anything?"

"And Ms. Sinclair, you need to bring something for the auction too."

The two of them stiffened. They had thought they were just here to show their faces and hadn't looked into the nature of the event. They came eagerly but had nothing to auction.

Suddenly, Karen pointed at me. "She brought something."

Joanna nodded. "Of course, Ms. Sharp brought a classic crocodile leather bag worth $200,000. After the auction, all the money will be donated."

Karen's face changed, and she glared at me. "Caroline, do you think Brandon makes money easily? Who told you to donate something?"

The room fell silent, and Elora looked at me with a mix of provocation and smugness, as if waiting for me to make a fool of myself.

"Mom, did you forget? The company where Brandon is the general manager was built by our family. Before I married Brandon, I could buy these bags at will. As for this one, it was just a small gift from my mom."

Karen's face turned completely ugly, and she turned away, not saying anything.

Given the current situation, anything she said would only humiliate herself.

Karen then took off a ring from her hand and threw it on the table. "I'll auction this."

Joanna glanced at it casually and handed it to a nearby waiter. "A diamond ring. Let's see who bids the most and give it as a bonus."

"You..."

Karen suddenly stood up, her eyes red as she looked at Joanna.

Joanna turned her gaze to her and asked slowly, "What about me?"

Karen could only grit her teeth and sit back down.

Seeing Karen had offered something, Elora had no choice but to take off a pair of earrings and hand them over.

"These are earrings my husband gave me. I'll auction these."

Joanna picked up the emerald earrings with two fingers and examined them under the light before handing them to someone nearby.

"Take these to a jeweler. They look fake to me."

###chapter 47

"This was a gift from my husband, how could it be fake?"

Elora stood up angrily, drawing everyone's attention to her. At this moment, she had become the laughingstock of the entire room.

"Who knows? You should go back and ask your husband."

Within a few minutes, a waiter came out with the pair of earrings and whispered something in Joanna's ear, after which she nodded.

"Ms. Kingsley, I'm sorry, but your earrings cannot be auctioned because they are fake."

"Impossible, how could he give me fake jewelry? Did you make a mistake?"

"Even someone like me, who loves collecting jewelry, can tell they are fake. Do you think the experts would make a mistake?"

"If Ms. Kingsley doesn't believe us, you can call your husband and we can confront him together."

"I..."

Elora clutched the hem of her dress, clearly too afraid to call her so-called husband, Brandon.

Karen, already upset from the earlier incident with the ring, couldn't stand Elora's behavior and pulled her down: "Sit down already, you're embarrassing yourself."

Joanna smiled lightly: "Since Ms. Kingsley has no items for auction, please refrain from speaking later to avoid disturbing our other guests."

With that, Joanna led Kathy and me to the front row, while Elora and Karen sat sullenly at the back.

Kathy laughed and held my hand: "Did you see that? Elora looked like she was about to grind her teeth to dust. She must hate us now."

"Looks like Brandon is quite smart, giving his mistress fake jewelry. A mistress and fake jewelry are a perfect match."

I couldn't help but smile at Kathy's words.

From this moment on, Elora probably realized what kind of person Brandon really was.

The auction officially began, and the items presented by the ladies were all exquisite, with a dazzling array of antique jewelry.

I also took a liking to a necklace and successfully bid for it.

I've come to understand that there's no need for me to scrimp and save for this family. Although the earrings Brandon gave Elora were fake, he did buy Karen a villa with our joint marital assets.

I will settle this score with Brandon and Elora sooner or later.

As the auction ended, a waiter suddenly approached me with the diamond ring Karen had brought out: "Ms. Thorne said this is for you."

I looked up and exchanged a glance with Joanna, who winked at me.

Understanding her intention, I got up and handed the ring to Karen: "Mom, this is a gift from Ms. Thorne for me. You should take it."

Karen was extremely embarrassed by the ring and wanted to leave, but after a moment's hesitation, she took the ring and left.

I looked at Elora, who was sitting there with a face full of mixed emotions.

"Why don't you ask your husband? Maybe he was too busy and bought a fake by mistake."

Elora gritted her teeth and nodded: "Yes, I'll ask him when I get back."

I then asked her: "How are you getting home later?"

Elora's expression suddenly turned smug: "My husband is coming to pick me up. What about you, Caroline?"

I shook my head helplessly: "I'll probably go back with Kathy."

Seeing Elora's smug look, I guessed that Brandon was coming to pick her up personally, but there was no way I would let that happen.

I told Kathy to say goodbye to Joanna for me and left the banquet early.

Sure enough, Brandon was sitting in his car at the entrance, smoking a cigarette.

When he saw me, his eyes widened in surprise: "Caroline?"

His eyes couldn't hide his amazement. I smiled: "What are you doing here?"

Brandon's face was full of awkwardness as he smiled: "I heard you were here, so I came to pick you up and take you home."

At the same time, I saw Elora coming out with an expectant look on her face, only to see me standing by Brandon's car.

Her expectant expression immediately turned into jealousy and resentment.

"Thank you, Brandon. I was just wondering how to get home."

With that, I opened the car door and got in without hesitation, looking out the window in Elora's direction.

"Elora, isn't your husband coming to pick you up?"

Elora looked at Brandon and gritted her teeth: "He just told me he had something to do, so I'll take a cab home."

I looked at Brandon in the driver's seat: "It's quite late, and it's not safe for Elora to go back alone. Why don't we give her a ride?"

Elora heard this and was about to walk to the back door to get in.

Brandon said bluntly: "There are plenty of cabs around here. What's unsafe about it? Let her go back on her own. We're not going the same way."

With that, Brandon stepped on the gas and drove off.

I couldn't see Elora's reaction, but I knew she must be furious.

Sure enough, that night when we got home, Brandon tried to get intimate with me: "Caroline, you look so beautiful today. How about we..."

Just then, Brandon's phone rang. He ignored it, but the calls kept coming one after another. I saw the caller ID with the last name Kingsley and knew it was Elora.

Brandon's mood was completely ruined by the calls. He answered impatiently: "Why do you keep calling? Didn't I say I'd come over in a few days? I'm busy right now."

"Why do you care what I'm doing? Just mind your own business."

He angrily hung up the phone. I asked him: "Who was that?"

Brandon replied irritably: "Earl, he's pushing me to take care of something. I might have to go on a business trip for a couple of days. Take care of yourself."

I immediately understood that Brandon wasn't going on a business trip; he was going to see Elora.

After today's incident, she was probably very angry and eager to take Brandon away from me to prove a point.

Thinking back, Brandon had mentioned several business trips before, which were likely all to see Elora, and I had never noticed.

"Alright, take care and go ahead."

I turned over and went to sleep, afraid that Brandon might suddenly get in the mood and touch me.

Brandon was already tired and soon fell asleep.

Just then, Simon sent me a message. I quickly opened it and saw a photo of Elora and Earl entering a hotel together.

He said: "Look what I found!"

I replied: "Elora and Earl have an affair? Then her child..."

Simon answered: "It's possible."

I thought about Jason's appearance. Although he looked a lot like Brandon, he also resembled Earl when he was young. I had initially assumed he was Brandon's child, but now it seemed uncertain.

Simon had given me a delightful surprise before bed, making me very happy.

The more chaotic the Jordan family became, the happier I was, and the more I could focus on my own plans.

###chapter 48

The next morning, Brandon left early.

I was cautious and called the company. The phone was quickly answered by one of his assistants.

"Hello, this is Caroline. Where did Brandon go today?"

The assistant quickly responded, "Oh, Mrs. Jordan, Mr. Jordan went on a business trip to a neighboring city. He might be back in two or three days. If you need anything, just let me know, and I'll pass the message along."

It seemed Brandon had already informed the company before he left, so even if I wanted to cause trouble, I couldn't.

It was almost time for Brett to go to school, so I hurriedly took him.

At the school gate, I saw Elora.

Apparently, last night's events hadn't affected her. She was even more beautifully dressed, clearly to welcome Brandon.

Seeing me, she greeted me first, "Caroline, are you here to drop off your child too?"

I nodded and watched Brett enter the school before turning back to her, "Did you get a new hairstyle?"

Elora nodded, her eyes filled with pride. She reached up to touch her curly hair, "My husband loves my curls, so I did it especially for him."

It seemed Elora was here to show off, thinking I didn't know.

"By the way, I don't know what your husband does. You seem very capable, so your husband must be impressive too."

I said this with a hidden meaning, and Elora became even more proud, "He's alright, but my husband is in the same industry as you guys. I met him after joining the company, and he's very good to me, giving me whatever I want."

"Oh..." I deliberately dragged out the sound, "So the gemstone earrings yesterday were just a misunderstanding?"

Elora's expression changed several times before she smiled, "I asked him about it. My husband was deceived. Someone told him it was top-quality gemstone material with a certificate, so he believed it and gave it to me."

"I already scolded him yesterday."

I smiled without saying anything. Brandon was a sharp-eyed person. He probably knew the gemstone was fake but thought Elora didn't deserve the real thing.

But I didn't say it out loud, just smiled silently.

"Let's have a meal together sometime. We're in the same industry, so we should have a lot to talk about over dinner."

Elora nodded and replied with a smile, "Sure, but my husband is very busy. We'll do it when he has time."

At that moment, Kathy suddenly called me, "Caroline, come to my studio quickly. I want to take you somewhere."

Her urgent tone suggested something important, so I didn't delay. I said goodbye to Elora and drove to her studio.

Simon was there too, driving a flashy Cullinan. Before I could enter the studio, Simon honked the horn.

"Get in."

Kathy poked her head out from the back seat, "Get in, Caroline. We're taking you to a good place to watch a show."

Simon added, "Brandon shouldn't be home today, right? It's okay if you come back late; he can't control you."

I was surprised and curious about how they knew, as I hadn't told them yet.

I got into the passenger seat and called Shirley, "Shirley, I might not be back for lunch today. I'm eating out with Kathy."

"No, Mrs. Jordan, Mr. Jordan specifically told me to remind you to come home early."

"Why are you so nosy? I'm just going out with Kathy for some shopping. Do you want to be Mrs. Jordan instead?"

Shirley was silent for a moment before saying, "No, no, Mrs. Jordan, please come back early in the afternoon!"

I hung up the phone, and Simon laughed, "You're getting tougher now."

"I used to be too weak, which is why they bullied me like this."

I looked at the mysterious Simon and Kathy, "Where are you taking me?"

"And how did you know Brandon is on a business trip today?"

Kathy laughed mysteriously from the back seat, "You'll find out soon. We're going to watch a great show."

Seeing their insistence on secrecy, I stopped asking.

But I was still curious until Simon's car entered the neighborhood where Karen lived.

I was surprised, "Isn't this where Brandon's mom Karen lives? What are you doing here?"

Simon smiled, "Guess who else lives here?"

I was stunned and then realized, "You mean Elora?"

I immediately understood. Brandon's business trip was to come to Elora's place. I might catch them having an affair.

"So that's your plan. What's so interesting about this?"

I had a physical aversion to these two people and wasn't interested.

But Kathy said, "Would I bring you out if it wasn't a grand show? There must be something super exciting happening."

Her words made me even more curious.

Simon stopped the car at a house a few doors down from Karen's, "Get out. This is our destination."

I looked at him in disbelief, "You didn't buy this house just for this, did you?"

Simon, wearing sunglasses, took them off and looked at me, "Do I look like a rich fool? Of course, I rented it."

I was relieved. If he asked me to pay for the house after this, I couldn't afford it.

Simon led us into the house, where all the curtains were drawn, making the living room dark.

He turned on the lights, revealing a lot of equipment in the center of the living room.

"Let's go to the second floor."

Kathy and I followed him upstairs.

The second floor was like the first, with curtains drawn in every room. The only difference was a room with several telescope-like devices and a video camera by the window.

Simon turned on the light, "I was going to show you a video, but I think the upcoming show will be more thrilling to watch live."

My curiosity was piqued. Just then, we heard a car outside.

Simon's eyes lit up, and he told us to look through the telescopes, "The show is starting."

I walked over and saw that the telescopes were pointed at the house between us and Karen's.

At that moment, a pink BMW drove in and slowly entered the garage.

Seeing the car, I was surprised, "That's Elora's car. She really lives next to Karen? I thought she'd live farther away."

Kathy sneered, "These people are shameless. Aren't they afraid of being punished for being so blatant?"

Elora got out of the car and looked surprised when she opened the door.

I said, "Brandon left home this morning. Elora's expression suggests she was startled by Brandon."

###chapter 49

Simon nodded, "Indeed, my people have been watching here. They say Brandon only came after Elora left. He probably wanted to surprise her."

What a surprise, I sneered, hoping it doesn't turn into a shock later!

Soon, Elora's expression turned into one of surprise, and she walked into the house with a smile.

Kathy looked at me with some concern, "Caroline, do you mind?"

I snorted, "Him? I don't care about a dirty man like Brandon."

Kathy immediately laughed, "That's good. Before coming here, I was worried about your ability to handle this, but Simon said you'd be fine. It scared me to death."

Simon quickly chimed in, "Wasn't I right? Caroline isn't as petty as you think."

I nodded. I had indeed become numb to Brandon's antics. Constantly caring about it would only torment me.

In the villa opposite, the two of them quickly went upstairs and started kissing, not even bothering to close the window.

Kathy clicked her tongue in disgust, "These two are really shameless. Aren't they afraid some kid might see them?"

I sneered, "They even tried to harm me. What else wouldn't they do? They probably find it thrilling."

Kathy nodded in agreement, "The more people see them, the more thrilling they probably find it."

Just as the two were about to strip completely, I noticed someone knocking on their door.

I looked closely and saw it was Karen.

"Why is she here?"

Kathy smiled mysteriously, "Do you remember Joanna?"

I quickly nodded, "What does this have to do with Joanna?"

Kathy said, "Although Joanna comes from a prominent family, she had her share of troubles. Her dad once abandoned her and her mom for a mistress. They relied on each other for a long time."

I had heard bits of this story, but I didn't know how Joanna eventually returned home. Such family secrets aren't easily shared.

"Later, Joanna's dad's career was full of setbacks. He consulted a fortune teller who said the mistress was bad for him, and Joanna's mom was the one who truly benefited him. Because of her, Joanna's dad could climb the career ladder. So, he coaxed and persuaded them to come back. The mistress, of course, disagreed and caused a lot of trouble. Eventually, he used some means to get rid of the mistress."

I was shocked, "I didn't expect Joanna's dad to believe in that."

Kathy nodded, "But you know what? After he brought Joanna and her mom back, his career did improve significantly. So now he treats Joanna's mom like a queen, afraid she'll be unhappy."

"This made Joanna particularly hate mistresses. So, when I told her about your situation yesterday, she was furious and decided to help you."

I felt grateful. Without my friends' help, I might have already met a tragic end.

"Karen desperately wants to join the wealthy wives' circle. After adding Joanna on WhatsApp yesterday, Joanna told her about a project where investing one million dollars could yield two and a half million dollars. Karen was so eager to join, but Joanna told her the deadline to pay was today at noon."

I understood, "So Karen is here to ask Brandon for money?"

Kathy nodded.

"But what if Karen realizes Joanna's project is a scam?"

Kathy shrugged, "Who said it was? Joanna never really asked for her money. Even if it gets exposed, Joanna can say she was joking. Joanna doesn't need that money, and who would believe she's scamming?"

I couldn't help but be amazed. Joanna was using her reputation as a guarantee.

After all, she's a wealthy heiress and doesn't need the money. Karen fell for it because of that.

"I must thank Joanna properly. She's such a good person."

Kathy was noncommittal, "Joanna said you can thank her after you're completely out of trouble."

I nodded repeatedly and continued watching Karen.

She rang the doorbell, but no one answered. She started banging on the door impatiently.

The two upstairs initially ignored the doorbell, but it got too noisy, so Elora put on her clothes and went downstairs.

At this moment, Simon pressed a device, and Elora and Karen's conversation started playing in the house.

I looked at Simon in surprise, and he smiled brightly, "I placed a listening device at Elora's door a while ago. It seems to be working well."

Karen had been knocking for a long time and was getting anxious. When she saw Elora, she quickly asked, "Where's Brandon? I need to talk to him."

Elora blocked the door, "He's not here. Go look somewhere else."

Karen's eyes widened, "How can he not be here? I called their house, and Shirley said he went on a business trip to the neighboring city. Isn't that here?"

Elora smiled, "Who knows? Maybe Brandon really went there. Mom, call his assistant and ask."

Elora turned to go upstairs, "Stop right there. Where are you rushing off to? To see your lover?"

"Are you betraying Brandon?"

Elora was furious, "Mom, how can you say that? I'm just tired and want to go upstairs to sleep."

"No way. You can't go anywhere until Brandon comes out."

Elora sighed helplessly, "Mom, stop being unreasonable."

Karen glared, "Who's being unreasonable? Who are you talking about?"

"I haven't even complained about you making me lose face in the wealthy circle, and you call me unreasonable? You shameless woman."

The fake gemstone incident still bothered Elora, and now she was completely agitated.

"Who's shameless? Brandon gave me a fake gemstone, and he's not embarrassed?"

Karen rolled her eyes, "Why would Brandon be embarrassed? What if he was tricked?"

"If Brandon was tricked, then so was I. Did you see how humiliated I was in front of Caroline last night?"

"Shut up. If Brandon tricked you, you deserved it. Who told you to be worth only fake goods?"

"Mom, that's too much. Haven't I done enough for the Jordan family? Do you think everything you have now came out of nowhere? Wasn't it all because I helped Brandon with his plans..."

Before she could finish, Karen slapped her.

I frowned. It seemed Elora was indeed involved in the plot against me.

###chapter 50

Elora covered her face, looking at Karen in disbelief.

"You dare hit me?"

Karen glared at her, "So what if I hit you? You're just a tool for the Jordan family. I even dare to hit Caroline, why wouldn't I hit you?"

Elora completely broke down, "I've done so much for your family. I transferred assets, I even had a son for Brandon. Even if I haven't achieved significant accomplishments, I've put in effort. What right do you have to hit me?"

"Wasn't it you who volunteered to help Brandon? Who asked you to do all that?"

"I call you 'Mom' out of respect, but don't really think you're my elder!"

"Who's your elder? I'm Caroline's elder. What does that have to do with you?"

"Fine, then go find Caroline. Let's see how many times that dying woman can still call you 'Mom'!"

Just then, Brandon, who was upstairs, couldn't stand the noise anymore and came down.

"Mom? What are you doing here?"

Seeing Brandon, Karen's eyes widened, "Elora, you bitch, didn't you say Brandon wasn't here? What are you trying to do?"

Elora covered her face, "It was Brandon who told me not to say anything. Why are you coming after me? If you have the guts, hit Brandon."

Karen sneered, "Why would I hit Brandon? I'll hit you! You shameless bitch!"

She stepped forward, grabbed Elora's hair, and started dragging her out.

Elora screamed in pain, "Let go!"

"Brandon, do something about your mom!"

Brandon frowned, looking at the scene with extreme annoyance, "Mom, let go. What are you doing?"

Karen glared at Brandon, "Now that you have Elora, you've forgotten about me? And she's not even your wife."

"I'm telling you, Brandon, if you dare marry this shameless woman, I'll cut ties with you."

Brandon, extremely annoyed, said, "Can you let go first? Stop making a scene!"

He couldn't stand it anymore and stepped forward to separate them. Karen had a large clump of hair in her hand, pulled from Elora's head.

Kathy grimaced, "Karen is really bad, but it's kind of satisfying!"

Elora, with a bald spot on her head, touched the area and went completely mad, "You old hag, get out of my house!"

Karen snorted, "This house was bought by Brandon. It's the Jordan family's property. What does it have to do with you?"

Brandon also frowned, "Elora, that's enough. How can you talk to my mom like that?"

Elora looked at Brandon in disbelief, "What's wrong with you? Karen came here to cause trouble and pulled out my hair, and you're still siding with her?"

"Brandon, what am I to you?"

Brandon remained silent, his face showing clear annoyance.

Karen, breathing heavily, glared at Elora.

Elora, with disheveled hair, collapsed on the floor, "Brandon, you said you wanted to get rid of Caroline. I helped you come up with ideas. You said you wanted to take over her company. I helped you get rid of the old employees. And Asher..."

Hearing this, I perked up, wanting to know what happened with Asher.

But the next second, Brandon slapped Elora across the face, gritting his teeth, "Enough, are you done?"

Elora, covering her face, screamed hysterically, "No!"

"If you don't let me speak, I'll go to Caroline and we'll go down together!"

With that, Elora stood up and started to leave.

Brandon and Karen exchanged a glance, their eyes cold.

Then Brandon kicked Elora in the stomach, sending her back into the house. At this point, we could only hear the sounds, not see the scene.

We heard Elora wail, "My baby, my baby."

The three of us exchanged glances, "Could Elora be pregnant again?"

Then we heard Karen and Brandon say, "Elora, that bitch, is pregnant again. What should we do, Brandon?"

Brandon, with a dark expression, stared at the scene inside, "Close the door first, don't let anyone see."

With that, the two of them went inside, completely cutting off the outside noise.

The show was over.

I sighed, wondering if it was because I was a mother that I felt sorry for the baby in Elora's belly.

This child shouldn't have been conceived by Elora, ending up like this.

Maybe knowing what I was thinking, Kathy patted my shoulder, "Don't be sad. Don't forget, if Elora were to deal with you in the future, she wouldn't show any mercy. She would put your children in the same situation. She doesn't deserve sympathy."

Simon nodded, "That's right. If it were you lying there today, what do you think Elora would do?"

I didn't say anything. I knew Simon and Kathy were right.

I could only hope that the unborn child would find a new family.

After a while, not knowing what was happening inside, Brandon came out with a briefcase, looking furious.

Seeing him, I was stunned, "Brandon is probably going home. I guess I should hurry back too."

Simon nodded, "I'll take you."

We went downstairs and got into Simon's car.

To avoid being seen, Kathy and I sat in the back seat.

As the car pulled out of the garage, I saw Brandon walking past us. He even bent down to look inside the car.

At that moment, my heart was in my throat.

Simon's voice was cold, "Don't worry, my car has tinted windows. He can't see anything."

But still, seeing Brandon's face so close, I held my breath in nervousness.

Fortunately, Brandon seemed to just take a look and didn't linger.

Our car smoothly left the neighborhood.

Kathy looked back at Brandon, "He's really cunning, afraid of being discovered, he didn't even drive here."

I sneered, Brandon has always been like this, putting all his thoughts into these things.

Simon's car dropped me off a few hundred feet from my neighborhood. Any closer and the cameras would catch me.

I thanked him and walked home slowly.

Unexpectedly, just as I reached the entrance, I ran into Brandon, who had just taken a cab back.

He saw me, full of suspicion, "Caroline? What are you doing here? Where's your car?"

"I just had dinner with Kathy and left my car at her studio. She just dropped me off, and I forgot to take it back. I'll get it tomorrow."

###chapter 51

I don't know if Brandon is suspicious. He got out of the car and walked home with me.

I looked at his gloomy face and pretended to be curious, "I was going to ask you, weren't you on a business trip today? Why did you come back suddenly?"

"You don't seem to be in a good mood either."

Brandon frowned, "Don't mention it. I got to the airport this morning, but the supplier didn't show up, so I had to take a cab back."

Knowing what had happened to Brandon earlier, I didn't say anything and silently watched him act.

"I'll never work with that supplier again."

He gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with anger. His state made me suspect that this statement was not directed at the supplier but at Elora.

I nodded and comforted him, "Alright, don't work with anyone who makes you angry. Stay away from them."

Brandon silently glanced at me, then surprisingly reached out and hugged me, sighing, "Caroline, you're still the best."

I listened silently, not saying a word.

Maybe everything that just happened was fake, but Brandon's words seemed to come from his heart.

I looked up into his eyes, trying to find any hint of regret.

But there was nothing, only the gentle mask he always wore when facing me. He had never given me his true heart.

I sneered and gently broke free from his embrace, "Alright, let's go home quickly before someone sees us."

Brandon might have been genuinely tired, so he nodded and didn't continue acting.

We went home together, and Shirley looked at us in surprise.

It was almost noon, and Brandon instructed Shirley, "Make me something to eat, I'm hungry."

Shirley went to the kitchen to busy herself. As I was about to go to my room, Brandon grabbed my hand, "Stay and eat with me."

"I already had lunch with Kathy."

Brandon still didn't let go, "Just eat a little."

Soon, Shirley made a few simple dishes. Actually, I was already hungry after all this, but since I told Brandon I had just eaten, I could only pretend to eat a few bites.

Shirley also sat down, and we ate together.

Suddenly, I asked, "By the way, I saw Elora this morning when I was dropping off Brett. I just found out her husband is in the same industry as us."

Mentioning Elora, Shirley and Brandon's expressions changed.

Shirley was jealous, clearly knowing that Elora had given Brandon a child.

Brandon, on the other hand, was impatient and annoyed, "Yeah."

I pretended not to see Brandon's expression and playfully scolded him, "You really are something, not even telling me. She said she met her husband at our company, and I didn't even know."

Brandon continued eating, "Nothing worth mentioning."

"Let's invite Elora and her husband over for dinner sometime. You said her husband's last name is Jordan, and he's in the same industry as you. What a coincidence."

Brandon frowned slightly, "Forget it, her husband is quite busy."

I smiled lightly, "So what? No matter how busy he is, he should have time for a meal. It's settled then. I'll invite her next time I see her."

Brandon nodded and sighed deeply, "Do as you please."

He quickly finished eating and said to me, "Caroline, I'm going to lie down for a while."

I nodded, watching him go upstairs, then turned to Shirley.

She had been listening to our conversation, thinking I hadn't noticed. I said with a hint of emotion, "Elora is really something. She found a rich husband and lives in a big villa next to Brandon's mom's house. I heard that house is very expensive."

Hearing this, Shirley couldn't hide her jealousy anymore and even started to praise me, "So what if her husband is rich? It's not her own money. It's still better to run a company like you did before and earn your own money."

I thought to myself that Shirley was insanely jealous, and my importance in her eyes had probably diminished.

"Everyone has different pursuits."

"I ran into Elora this morning, and she told me she's planning to have a second child. It seems she's very happy. And her son Jason, you haven't seen him, but he's really cute."

Hearing this, Shirley clenched the cloth she was using to wipe the table tightly before finally letting go.

"Really?"

I nodded, "Yes, the first time I saw Jason, I thought he was Brandon's illegitimate child. Jason looks so much like Brandon when he was a kid."

Shirley forced a smile, "Then Jason must be quite handsome."

"When Elora comes over for dinner, I'll show you. You'll understand when you see him."

After I finished speaking, Shirley nodded and didn't say anything else.

I looked at her, seeing her eyes filled with a murderous look.

I laughed inwardly. I needed to stir up her jealousy to make her help me deal with Brandon and Elora.

I went upstairs, and in the room, Brandon was looking at his phone and laughing. When he saw me come in, he immediately put on a serious face.

"Caroline, why are you here?"

"I'm tired from shopping today, so I came up to rest."

Brandon nodded and lifted the blanket on the bed. As soon as I lay down, he came over and started touching me inappropriately.

I felt disgusted, my skin crawling. I pushed his hand away, "What are you doing? Shirley is still outside doing housework."

"So what? She wouldn't dare come in. Besides, we're husband and wife; no one can control us."

I thought to myself how cold-blooded Brandon was. He had just lost a child, yet he acted as if nothing had happened.

But I couldn't bring it up. As I was thinking of how to refuse, there was a sudden knock on the door.

Brandon, having his mood ruined twice in one day, was already in a foul mood. He stormed to the door and yanked it open, shouting.

"What is it?"

Shirley flinched and pointed outside, "Ms. Patel is here to deliver the car to Mrs. Jordan."

I felt like hugging Kathy and kissing her a hundred times. Kathy was truly my good friend, arriving just in time.

I quickly got out of bed, "Really? I was planning to pick it up myself tomorrow. She's so considerate."

I didn't show it on my face, but I was overjoyed inside.

I hurried downstairs and saw Kathy sitting on the sofa, drinking coffee. Seeing Brandon and me coming down one after the other, she smiled, "I hope I didn't interrupt anything in the middle of the day."

I quickly gave Kathy a grateful look and pointed at Brandon with my chin, making a disgusted face.

Kathy immediately understood, "Judging by Caroline's expression, I really did interrupt, didn't I?"

I sat on the sofa, pretending to be shy, "What are you talking about!"

###chapter 52

Brandon sat down, his face cold: "As long as you know."

Kathy rolled her eyes and said nothing.

She turned her head to me and said, "I thought you had to take Brett tomorrow morning, so I quickly brought your car back. Am I considerate?"

I nodded, pretending to be helpless: "Considerate."

Brandon said quietly, "I also have a car to take Brett."

Kathy shrugged helplessly: "Look at Brandon, I interrupted him once, and this is how he treats me."

I didn't say anything, just gave Brandon a helpless smile.

Kathy tilted her head back and finished her coffee in one gulp, then stood up: "Alright, I brought the car back, so I'll leave now and not disturb you."

She looked at me: "Will you walk me out?"

I nodded, got up, and followed her.

Brandon wanted to follow, but I pretended to be considerate and straightened his collar: "You go rest, aren't you tired? I'll walk Kathy out."

Brandon had no reason to follow, so he nodded, glanced at Kathy, and then went upstairs.

As I walked Kathy out, she looked around to make sure Shirley and Brandon weren't following, then eagerly said.

"I just found out something. I had a friend at the bank check your properties and other assets, and they've all been mortgaged by Brandon."

"Brandon is trying to transfer all your assets!"

I kept a calm face: "Kathy, did you find the lawyer I asked you to find last time? I want to meet with him. I suspect that my shares in the company have also been transferred by Brandon."

Kathy nodded: "I found one a long time ago, a lawyer from Regal City. Brandon couldn't possibly know him."

Kathy was very reliable, and I nodded in relief.

But just then, Kathy suddenly said: "No, Caroline, smile quickly, Brandon is watching us from the second floor!"

I quickly smiled with Kathy, as if we were talking about something happy.

"Alright, tell me when you're free, and I'll bring the lawyer over."

I nodded, smiling as I thanked Kathy.

She patted my shoulder and laughed: "Why are you thanking me for such a small thing?"

Then she suddenly said: "By the way, no matter what excuse you use, don't have sex with Brandon. I suspect he has a disease."

I nodded. Kathy didn't need to tell me that. Just thinking about him having sex with so many women made me feel sick, so of course, I wouldn't comply with him.

After Kathy left, I went upstairs.

Brandon asked me: "What were you two talking about? You seemed so happy, I could hear your laughter from upstairs."

I knew he was lying because Kathy and I were fake laughing. He must have just seen us.

"It was about something that happened when she was making custom clothes for someone. I thought it was funny."

"Then tell me about it."

Brandon insisted, looking at me.

I smiled: "It's just women's stuff. You wouldn't understand even if I told you."

I kept a neutral expression, and Brandon stared at me for a long time, as if trying to determine if I was lying.

After a while, he finally looked away: "Fine, don't tell me. I'm going to sleep, Caroline."

Hearing that he wasn't continuing his previous behavior, I quietly sighed in relief and turned to lie down.

I was planning to find a time to meet the lawyer Kathy had arranged for me. I needed to get all the facts straight to feel confident.

Thinking about it, I actually fell asleep. When I woke up, Brandon was still sleeping. He must have been really tired, his brows furrowed tightly.

Before leaving, I took the kids downstairs.

I handed the kids to Shirley and said: "I'm going out to buy some groceries for Brandon. He's in a bad mood and exhausted today, so I want to make something he likes for dinner."

Shirley hadn't seen the kids in a while. Normally, grocery shopping was her job, but she nodded, wanting to take care of the kids: "You go ahead, Mrs. Jordan."

After leaving, I breathed a sigh of relief and headed straight to the bank with the documents I had secretly taken.

I suspected that the money in our joint account had also been transferred by Brandon.

Sure enough, when I checked, there was hardly any money left in the joint account. I knew Brandon wouldn't leave that money untouched.

I was shaking with anger. Brandon and I used to manage our own money separately. Later, Brandon suggested we save a fund for the kids' future, so we opened this account and started depositing money together.

Although Brandon's deposits were only one percent of mine each time, I never complained about him earning less.

After Brett was born, I gradually stepped back, and Brandon's deposits increased while mine decreased.

I withdrew some money and went to the supermarket to buy groceries.

When I got back, Brandon was already awake. He seemed to have just taken a shower, his hair still wet, sitting on the couch looking at me.

"You could have let Shirley buy the groceries. Why did you go yourself?"

I shook my head and silently sat on the couch.

Brandon glanced at me and asked what I bought.

I didn't answer, just put the groceries on the floor for him to see.

Brandon sensed something was wrong and quickly asked: "Caroline, what's wrong?"

I finally looked at him, genuinely angry but also acting.

"I want to know, where did the money in our account go?"

Brandon was stunned, looking at me suspiciously: "Why did you check the account out of the blue?"

I sneered: "I didn't have any money on me, so I went to the bank to withdraw some. I thought I'd check how much we had saved for the kids, but I saw a large sum missing. I want to know where the money went."

There was a dashcam in the car, and knowing Brandon's cautious nature, I had to be open about my actions, or he would definitely be suspicious.

As expected, Brandon looked a bit flustered, then quickly regained his composure.

"I just didn't tell you. A while ago, a payment didn't come through, so I used the money in our account to buy equipment. I planned to transfer it back once the payment arrived."

I frowned slightly: "Why didn't you tell me about something so important? You were the one who said this money was for the kids and that no one could touch it."

Seeing that I was genuinely angry, Brandon said: "Caroline, don't be mad. I'll urge them to settle the payment right away. I know the kids' money is untouchable. I was just in a bind and didn't want to worry you, so I used it secretly. Don't worry, I'll get the payment back in a few days."

I frowned at him: "Really?"

"Of course, I wouldn't touch the kids' money!"

"It better be that way. I'll check the bank in a few days to see if you've transferred it back." I said coldly.

###chapter 53

Brandon's eyes flickered slightly, and he gently smiled while holding me, "Caroline, don't worry, I would never touch our child's money. Once the payment is settled in a few days, I'll transfer the money back."

Since he said that, I saw no need to argue further and just nodded slightly.

The next day, Brandon returned to work as usual, and I drove Brett to school in the morning. As I expected, Elora was not at the school gate.

You should know that she usually stands at the school gate, dressed beautifully, to send Jason to school, attracting the attention of the surrounding fathers and male teachers.

However, I saw Jason getting out of a car, the windows of which were covered with anti-peep film, but I inexplicably felt that someone inside was watching me.

I looked down at Jason, "Where's your mom, Elora?"

Jason's cute face and round eyes looked harmless.

"My mom is sick and resting now. Do you need something from her?"

Of course, I knew what was really going on with Elora, "Then tell Elora that Caroline wants to visit her and ask if she agrees."

Jason nodded and ran into the school with his little backpack.

At that moment, I suddenly felt a tug on my clothes. I looked down and saw it was Brett.

He looked up at me with his big eyes, cautiously saying, "Mom, can you stay away from Elora?"

I was taken aback and squatted down to look Brett in the eyes, "Why?"

Brett shook his head, "I just don't like their family, it's weird."

As he said this, Brett wrinkled his little nose slightly, looking very cute.

I patted his head, feeling a surge of emotion.

Children do have a sense of perception, perhaps even more sensitive than us adults in many ways.

I nodded, "Alright, if you don't want mom to interact with them, then mom will stay away from them."

Brett nodded happily and went into the school.

After watching him go in, I drove to Kathy's studio and arranged a meeting with the lawyer for three days later.

Kathy nodded, "Okay, I'll inform the lawyer to come a day earlier."

I thanked her and called Simon, asking him to compile a written report of my current situation. Given my circumstances, keeping documents at home would be like courting death.

After giving instructions, I drove back home.

Shirley was sitting on the couch watching TV. Seeing me return, she said, "Mrs. Jordan, did you drop Brett off at school?"

I nodded, putting down my coat and bag, "Did the kids cry?"

She shook her head, "I just checked on them, they're sleeping soundly in your room."

The reason I don't dare to leave the house for too long is because of this. Even though I'm worried about the kids being home alone, I don't trust leaving them with Shirley. After all, I don't know what Shirley might do.

I glanced at Shirley, who was lying on the couch, looking very relaxed, like a hostess.

I frowned but said nothing.

To destroy someone, you must first let them swell with pride. Clearly, the more Shirley acts like the hostess, the more satisfying it will be when her illusion is shattered. So why should I stop her?

I went to my room and, after confirming the kids were still asleep, took a nap myself.

Although I haven't been doing anything physically exhausting lately, I still feel very tired.

The main reason is probably the mental exhaustion from constantly outsmarting Brandon and Shirley. So, whenever I get the chance, I need to rest well.

In the evening, after waking up, Simon had sent me a message saying the documents were ready and he would deliver them to Kathy without involving me.

I felt relieved, knowing Simon and his team were very reliable.

Moreover, Simon is a very mysterious person. I know nothing about his past, but given the amount of information he can gather here, he must be someone of influence.

But that's a paradox. People of influence don't need to work as private detectives for money, making Simon's identity a mystery.

However, judging by his car and demeanor, he doesn't seem to lack money.

Maybe Simon works as a detective purely out of interest.

I got up and left the room.

Brandon was sitting on the couch looking at his phone, while Shirley was busy in the study.

Paula hadn't returned yet.

I went downstairs, and Brandon, seeing me, extended his arm, and I nestled into his embrace.

Although this act disgusted me, occasional intimate gestures would keep him from suspecting me.

"Brandon, you're back. How was work today? Was it smooth?"

Brandon brushed a strand of hair from my ear, a hint of irritation in his eyes, but he still said gently, "Smooth, very smooth. Just thinking of you and the kids at home gives me motivation."

I believed this. After all, he must have been thinking of me when he secretly mortgaged my property, which gave him even more drive.

"By the way, I ran into Elora's child, Jason, today. He said Elora is sick. Do you know what's going on? Should I visit her?"

"What's there to visit? Everyone gets sick. She'll be fine in a while."

Brandon's coldness shocked me because I knew Elora's illness was due to a miscarriage, yet Brandon didn't care at all.

To give an inappropriate example, if one day the kids and I were homeless, he probably wouldn't even glance at us.

This behavior only fueled my determination to take back everything with the kids. I couldn't let someone as selfish and cold as Brandon take care of my children.

"You can't say that. Some people have weak bodies, like me."

Brandon smiled without saying anything.

"By the way, I asked Jason his dad's name today. Guess what it is?"

Seeing his absent-minded look, I reminded him.

Brandon was startled and quickly looked up, "What did he say his dad's name is?"

The guilt in Brandon's eyes was obvious.

I shook my head, feeling very satisfied seeing him so scared, almost wanting to laugh. "He..."

I deliberately dragged out the word, making Brandon so anxious he was almost sweating, looking at me eagerly.

I slowly said, "He didn't tell me, so I don't know."

Brandon visibly sighed in relief, "Can you not pause like that when you talk? It makes me uncomfortable."

I laughed, "Are you uncomfortable in your heart or just hearing it?"

"I remember Jason calling you dad before."

Brandon impatiently frowned, "That was Jason being childish. How can you take that seriously?"

"If that's the case, I might have countless children."

###chapter 54

I just smiled and quietly watched Brandon.

"At that time, I really thought he would mention your name, after all, you two look so much alike."

Brandon wiped the sweat off his forehead, "What do you mean alike? Hurry up and eat, you always overthink things."

Saying that, he pulled me to the dining table.

Soon, the appointment with the lawyer that Kathy helped me arrange was approaching. I planned to go after dropping Brett off at school in the morning.

Unexpectedly, Brandon insisted on coming with me to drop Brett off that day.

After dropping him off, he drove me back home and got out of the car himself, as if he intended to follow me wherever I went.

If it weren't for the fact that only Simon, Kathy, and I knew about this plan, I would have suspected a leak.

Brandon's behavior was too deliberate, making it hard for me not to notice.

I said I was going to have lunch with Kathy, he wanted to come along. I said I was going to sleep, he stayed by my side, making it impossible for me to go out alone.

I had a gut feeling that something was off with Brandon. Either he had discovered something about me, or someone had tipped him off.

I scanned the entire house; the only ones who could have leaked information were the sisters, Shirley and Paula.

But it seemed Paula's purpose in coming to me was to take everything Shirley had. Although I always felt Paula wasn't that simple, she didn't seem to have any reason to harm me.

That left only one person, Shirley.

So, while Brandon was in the study having a meeting, I went to the living room to get the voice recorder and told Shirley and Paula that I was going to take a bath. They didn't suspect anything and let me into the bathroom.

I turned on the shower to make sure no sound could be heard outside, then started playing the contents of the voice recorder.

As I pressed play, I indeed heard Shirley and Brandon's voices from yesterday.

"Don't you think Caroline is getting better and better? I saw her exercising in her room the other day."

I was stunned, recalling that it was probably one time when Shirley came to clean my room, and I had just gotten up and decided to stretch in the sunlight.

For someone who had been bedridden and emaciated, this was an inexplicable thing.

"And she often goes out to dine with Kathy now, just like before she got sick." Shirley's voice came from the recorder, making me frown.

I didn't expect her to still be observing me, and so meticulously at that.

I gritted my teeth, realizing I had been too careless and exposed a flaw.

Brandon hadn't spoken for a long time, and Shirley's voice became anxious, "Brandon, it doesn't matter if you don't make me Mrs. Jordan, but I'm genuinely thinking of you."

"Do you think Caroline won't notice anything unusual once she recovers? Won't she go back to the hospital for a check-up? She doesn't have any hidden illnesses, she'll easily connect it to the medicine we've been giving her. Have you gone soft?"

Brandon spoke in a low voice, "This has nothing to do with you."

Shirley sneered, her voice filled with jealousy, "Who does it have to do with? Elora?"

"I've heard you mention her quite a bit these days. Caroline might not understand, but I do. Is Elora your lover?"

"Shirley, you're crossing the line."

Brandon's voice was sinister, warning Shirley.

But Shirley seemed indifferent, continuing, "I'm just reminding you, as I said before, it doesn't matter who you marry as Mrs. Jordan, whether it's me or Elora, but Caroline must die. She will definitely ruin your plans."

Brandon pondered for a long time before finally speaking slowly, "From today on, follow her, see where she goes and who she meets. If she shows any signs of suspicion, increase the dosage, or use other means to keep her asleep. But don't let her die, I have a use for Caroline. Don't mess up my plans."

Shirley was silent for a long time, then said jealously, "Do you not want Caroline to die?"

"Shut up and get out."

I clenched my teeth in anger after listening.

Shirley was so shameless. No wonder Brandon was following me today; he had started to suspect me.

It seemed the meeting with the lawyer arranged by Kathy might be my last chance to be alone.

I finished my bath, wet my hair, and came out of the bathroom.

To my horror, I found Shirley standing in my room, staring at me.

I was startled and glared at her, "Are you crazy? Standing here like a ghost to scare me?"

Shirley shook her head, forcing a smile, "No, Mrs. Jordan, I was just checking if the kids needed a diaper change or anything, trying to help you out."

I knew the diaper change was just an excuse; she was here to monitor me.

But it seemed she didn't know anything yet, otherwise, she wouldn't be reacting like this.

I nodded, "Then come with me to buy some clothes for the kids. Don't you think their clothes are getting too small?"

Shirley hesitated, "Kids grow fast, buying new clothes will soon be outgrown. Why not let them wear Brett's old clothes? Otherwise, it's a waste of money."

I frowned, wiping my wet hair, and stared at Shirley expressionlessly.

"Do you think Brandon will see you as a good woman because of what you said?"

Shirley was taken aback, her eyes showing guilt, "Mrs. Jordan, why would you say that?"

I sneered, "So you still know I'm Mrs. Jordan. I thought you were trying to show off your frugality to make Brandon like you."

Shirley's face turned red, and she quickly shook her head, "No, Mrs. Jordan, that's not what I meant."

She glanced at the kids, "What about the kids?"

I got up and walked out, "Isn't Paula at home? Let her take care of the kids. You come with me to buy things."

Shirley hesitated for a moment, then nodded in agreement.

I went to Paula's room, where she was lying on the bed looking at her phone. Seeing me enter, she sat up, "Mrs. Jordan."

No matter what, these sisters still acted very proper in front of me.

"Shirley and I are going out for a while. Please take care of the kids."

Paula immediately agreed and got up.

I changed my clothes and was about to go out with Shirley when she said, "Mrs. Jordan, wait a moment, I'll go inform Mr. Jordan."

I stood at the door waiting for her. After a while, she came out of Brandon's office and jogged over to me, "Let's go, Mrs. Jordan."

I looked up and saw Brandon standing at the second-floor railing, waving at me, "Have fun, use my card."

###chapter 55

Shirley and I went to the mall to buy baby clothes.

Not for any other reason, just because Kathy and the lawyer were at a restaurant on this street.

Shirley and I got off the car at the street corner, and I said to her, "It's been a long time since we went shopping. How about we take a stroll and buy some things for the house?"

Shirley, of course, nodded in agreement.

I led Shirley forward, and soon we saw the restaurant Kathy had mentioned.

Before this, I had already texted Kathy, telling her that I had some issues and might be delayed, asking her to show my documents to the lawyer first.

Shirley and I entered a baby store. Although this wasn't my main purpose, these cute little clothes really increased my maternal love.

And Shirley was obviously the same; she was mesmerized, thinking everything was great.

When she was about to lose control, I pulled her away, empty-handed.

"I suddenly remembered, there's a beauty salon ahead. How about we get some treatments first, then go shopping, and then head straight home?"

Shirley hesitated a bit, "Mrs. Jordan, you go for the treatment, I can go buy the clothes."

"That won't do. I still have a lot of money there, and if I don't use it this year, it will be cleared. Can you help me out?"

My words indeed persuaded Shirley, and she reluctantly nodded and followed me.

At the spa, I asked the staff to give us each a room, as I wanted to rest a bit.

Shirley became obviously alert, staring at me, "Mrs. Jordan, let's stay in one room so I can take care of you."

I frowned, thinking she was really troublesome, "No need, we're both here to spend money. Why should you take care of me? Just take care of yourself."

Shirley still insisted, "Then I'll start after you go in, Mrs. Jordan."

I didn't want to talk to her anymore, so I walked straight into my room, undressed, and put on a face mask in front of her.

Shirley waited at the door for another ten minutes, and after confirming I didn't come out, she finally went into another room at the staff's request.

And this was exactly the moment I was waiting for. As soon as Shirley entered the room, the staff quickly reminded me to change clothes and leave through the back door.

This spa was owned by Joanna, and it was Kathy who reminded me of this.

So I called Joanna and asked her for a small favor, promising to repay her in the future.

This small favor was nothing to her, so she easily agreed to have her staff cooperate with me.

Under the staff's cover, I quickly changed clothes, removed the face mask, and slipped out through the back door.

Meanwhile, they would come to remind me before Shirley finished her face mask.

I went straight to the private room Kathy had sent me, where I met the lawyer she had arranged for me.

"Caroline, let me introduce you to Travis Franklin from Regal City Law Firm. Travis, this is my friend Caroline."

We shook hands and got to know each other briefly. I said, "Mr. Franklin, time is tight, so I'll get straight to the point. If I file for divorce now, can I get both the child and the money?"

Travis had a delicate face, but his eyes were particularly mature, which matched my image of a lawyer.

Regardless of his appearance, those eyes must have seen a lot.

Travis frowned slightly and then shook his head, "I can tell you clearly, no."

"Because most of your assets are mortgaged, and your company's shares have been taken by your husband Brandon. In other words, you have no income now, so even if you go to court, the child won't be awarded to you."

I took a deep breath, "But those assets were transferred without my knowledge. So what if I get the assets back?"

He shook his head, "It's still difficult because you can't prove you were unaware at the time. Unless there's evidence, but according to Ms. Patel, you were also in a confused state at the time, so it's absolutely impossible."

I nodded heavily.

Kathy slammed the table in anger, "This is infuriating! Brandon is such a bastard, doing things so ruthlessly?"

"No money, no child, does Caroline have to give up everything to leave him?"

"He's the one who's been cheating all along!"

Travis nodded, "Speaking of which, the evidence of his infidelity you collected can prevent him from getting the assets, but most of your marital assets have already been transferred, so you can only get the part he didn't transfer."

I frowned tightly, "That's not much money."

Travis nodded, "So this is a long-term conspiracy by Brandon against you. By the time you realize it and want to fight back, it's already too late."

The private room fell into a deathly silence, no one spoke.

After a while, I looked up at Travis, "What if I use some means? If I transfer the money Brandon took back, would it be considered our marital property?"

Travis nodded slightly, "In theory, yes, but I don't recommend you do that because you're walking on the edge of the law, and one wrong step could lead to disaster."

I shook my head, "I've made up my mind. I want both the money and the child, even if it means going to jail."

Travis pondered for a moment, then nodded, "In that case, I might be able to help you."

I thanked him sincerely. With Travis's help, my hope for victory increased.

After Kathy saw Travis off, she turned back and held my hand, "Caroline, have you really thought this through? What Mr. Franklin said sounds very dangerous."

I nodded firmly, "No matter what, I can't let Brandon have his way. Do you think he will take good care of the three children if he gets custody?"

"Of course not."

"Exactly, so if I end up in jail, please visit my mom and the kids often."

Kathy squeezed my hand, "Caroline, don't think too much. That day won't come. Even if it does, I'm already the godmother of the three kids. It's my duty."

With a good friend like Kathy, what do I have to worry about?

Just then, there was a knock on the private room door. It was the staff from the spa next door reminding me.

"Ms. Ross has ten minutes left."

I quickly said goodbye to Kathy and returned to the spa room, changed back into my clothes, and put on the face mask as before.

Soon, I heard the door to my room open, "Mrs. Jordan, are you not done yet?"

###chapter 56

I opened my eyes and looked at Shirley, "Oh, are you done?"

She nodded, "Looking at me suspiciously? Mrs. Jordan, why did it take you so long?"

Before I could speak, the staff who was applying the mask for me spoke up, "Mrs. Jordan took a nap earlier, so some of the treatments were delayed, making her finish later than you."

Shirley couldn't say much, "Mrs. Jordan, once you're done, let's go buy the kids' stuff and head home. It's almost afternoon, and it's time to make dinner."

I slowly got up and glared at her, "All you do is rush me, even for a facial. Let's go."

I removed the mask, changed my clothes, and went out with her.

Before leaving, I thanked the staff who spoke up for me. She shook her head, "Ms. Thorne instructed us to speak up for you."

I nodded, "Thank you, and thank Ms. Thorne too."

Shirley and I returned to the baby store and bought all the clothes we had our eyes on earlier, then drove home.

By the time we got home, it was already afternoon. Shirley, who had been in a hurry to cook, didn't go to the kitchen but went straight to Brandon's room.

I looked up and saw her walk in, probably reporting to Brandon about what happened earlier.

Soon, Brandon came downstairs and hugged me, "Went for a spa?"

He sniffed lightly at my neck, "No wonder you smell so good."

But his action gave me goosebumps all over, and I wanted to push him away immediately.

However, fearing his suspicion, I didn't do it and just endured it.

"Yes, do I look better?"

He replied, "You always look good, no matter what."

I had to admit, Brandon was a good lover. His emotional intelligence was high enough to easily make any woman happy, as long as he wanted to.

That's why so many women around him were devoted to him.

Fortunately, I had already seen through his true nature and just wanted to sneer at him.

At that moment, Paula came out of her room and saw Brandon holding me, her eyes full of jealousy.

I sighed inwardly. I had thought Paula had no feelings for Brandon and just saw him as a rich man, but now it seemed she had changed.

There would be more drama to watch in the future.

In the following days, whether I was picking up or dropping off Brett, I could always see Shirley's sneaky figure behind me, occasionally taking photos with her phone.

Luckily, I hadn't contacted Simon and the others these days. Instead, I spent my time dining with Kathy at various restaurants.

When I used to work, I loved finding delicious food in different cities during my breaks to relieve stress.

But after having kids, I had to give up this hobby, and now I was picking it up again.

Kathy and I wandered around the city, while Shirley followed us silently. When we ate inside, Shirley pitifully squatted outside.

I pointed in Shirley's direction to Kathy, "Honestly, when you said you'd hire a private detective for me, I thought it would be like this, squatting outside all day."

Kathy looked at Shirley's miserable state and couldn't help but laugh.

At that moment, we heard someone in the booth behind us laugh too, "You really misunderstood me."

Simon was sitting in the booth next to us. We had arranged to meet here, and Shirley had never seen Simon, so she couldn't tell.

We all laughed together, "I asked you here to get some advice. Shirley following me around every day isn't a solution. We need to find a way to get rid of her."

Simon chuckled, "That's easy. Just set her up with a trap together."

He told us a plan, and Kathy and I nodded repeatedly, "Your idea is really wicked."

Simon sneered, "Are you praising or insulting me?"

After parting with Simon, I drove to pick up Brett and slowly went home.

Shirley followed me, having not eaten all day, her lips pale from hunger.

I pretended to be displeased and looked at her, "Where have you been? Don't you know Brandon is coming home soon? Why haven't you cooked yet?"

Shirley bit her lip, unable to say she was following me, and could only apologize before heading to the kitchen.

In the following days, I wandered around, meeting other wealthy ladies for afternoon tea.

But Shirley got smarter and started bringing food in her car.

Through Kathy's introduction, I had lunch with Joanna and asked her for a favor.

Joanna, knowing Shirley was also a mistress, got even angrier and agreed without hesitation.

So one morning, I didn't drive but took a cab to a club after leaving the neighborhood.

The club, Elysian Club, was a place that provided services for wealthy ladies.

Before entering, I saw Shirley secretly following and taking a photo.

I sneered and went to Joanna's private room.

Soon, Brandon stormed in, kicking the door open.

"Caroline, who allowed you to come to a place like this?"

"Do you know what kind of women come here? You're a mother now, don't you have any shame!"

The door opened, and Joanna sat on the sofa, looking at Brandon expressionlessly, "Mr. Jordan, tell me, what kind of women come to this place?"

Seeing Brandon's stiff face, I only felt he was hateful and disgusting.

He had countless mistresses outside but thought it was filthy for me to come to a place like this. It was a double standard.

Brandon didn't expect to see Joanna here, and his expression changed repeatedly, not knowing how to react.

Shirley, seeing Brandon suddenly stop, didn't know what was happening.

"Mr. Jordan, I just saw Mrs. Jordan come in here. This place is filthy. Who knows what she might do?"

Seeing Brandon not moving, Shirley exaggerated.

Brandon gritted his teeth and slowly said, "Shut up."

Shirley didn't understand, "Mr. Jordan, Mrs. Jordan really..."

Before she could finish, Brandon turned and slapped her, "Get out of here now!"

Shirley was stunned, but seeing Brandon's bloodshot eyes, she felt scared and quickly left.

Joanna stood up and looked at Brandon, "Mr. Jordan, we friends are having a gathering. What do you mean by this?"

"Or do you think we're not good women and might lead Caroline astray?"

Brandon's face turned red, and he shook his head repeatedly.

In business, everyone knew Joanna's father.

Businessmen respected power because it brought greater profits, so no one dared to offend Joanna's father.

But now, Brandon not only kicked open Joanna's private room door but also insulted her.

Brandon's face turned purple with regret, and he kept apologizing, "I'm sorry, Ms. Thorne. I really didn't know you were here."

###chapter 57

I looked at his humble appearance and felt an indescribable satisfaction in my heart.

Serves you right, Brandon, you deserve this.

Joanna turned to look at me, "Ms. Sharp, although I usually don't like to break up others, I still advise you to reconsider such a husband."

Brandon gritted his teeth, not daring to say a word.

I silently walked up to Brandon and slapped him across the face with a crisp sound.

Brandon looked up at me in disbelief, "This slap is to apologize on behalf of Ms. Thorne."

Brandon glanced past me at Joanna's expression, immediately restraining all his emotions, looking like he was willing to take the beating.

The anger in my heart was burning like a pot of oil, making me want to kill Brandon right then and there.

I raised my hand again and slapped Brandon once more, this time he didn't react.

"Tell me, why did you have Shirley follow me here? Are you suspicious of me? Monitoring me?"

Brandon had to endure the slap and then shook his head, "I don't know why she did that, she might be trying to drive a wedge between us, Caroline. It was all her idea, it has nothing to do with me."

I looked at him mockingly, not expecting him to distance himself so quickly. If he had admitted it, I would have considered him responsible.

Unfortunately, no matter how well he dressed, he was still a weak coward at heart.

I turned to Joanna, "Ms. Thorne, I've already taught him a lesson, please don't be mad at me. Please give our company a chance at the upcoming dinner."

Joanna smirked and waved us off, "I'll think about it."

Brandon was stunned, looking at me with a puzzled expression, "What dinner?"

Outside the private room, I glared at him, "Do you know you almost ruined my plan?"

Brandon ignored the stinging pain from the slaps and hurriedly asked, "What dinner? Joanna's or her father's?"

I got into the car and said irritably, "Joanna's father is having a dinner with representatives from various industries in our city to discuss export business, supported by the government. If we become one of the first batch of export companies, the profits will be unimaginable. And you almost ruined it for me, do you understand?"

Brandon was speechless, "Caroline, can I go back and apologize to Ms. Thorne?"

"What's the use of your apology? I just hope those two slaps relieved Ms. Thorne's anger."

Brandon didn't dare to speak anymore, knowing how big of an opportunity he had missed.

After all, the foreign market was still an untapped territory for domestic companies, and no one knew how much money could be made.

He gritted his teeth, his face darkening.

I also remained silent. When we got home, he reached out to help me out of the car, but I ignored him and went into the living room by myself.

I casually placed my bag in the living room and sat on the sofa, my face full of anger.

Brandon followed me closely.

Seeing us like this, Shirley knew she was in trouble and tried to stay away, but I called her over.

"Shirley, get over here!"

She came over trembling, constantly signaling Brandon with her eyes.

But Brandon was focused on massaging my shoulders, not saying a word.

He didn't dare to speak, knowing he was in the wrong.

"Caroline, I really know I was wrong, please don't be mad. It's bad for your health."

I sneered, "You're worried about my health? Then tell me, what was your intention?"

"Do you know why I've been trying so hard to build a good relationship with Joanna? It's all for you. Have you transferred the money back to the family account?"

Brandon was stunned, then shook his head, "Caroline, give me more time."

"How much longer? Can't you transfer it back? Does the company still have cash flow?"

"If you hadn't transferred the money, would I have to drag my weak body to socialize with them? I see the company is full of your people now, you've become too arrogant. Don't forget you were just a fitness coach before. If you don't understand, come ask me."

Brandon was humiliated in public, his face changing colors, but he didn't dare to speak.

"You misunderstood Earl and the others, they are all thinking for the company."

I sneered, "Really? Brandon, ask yourself, how many projects have failed since you took over the company? The annual profit on the report has been declining every year, don't you know?"

"Is this what you call thinking for the company?"

Brandon was speechless, but his face looked terrible.

"Caroline, don't say that. Although they haven't achieved much, they've put in a lot of effort."

I laughed, "I haven't seen them do anything, just enjoying themselves. If Irene hadn't become the financial director, could she afford that big villa? And Earl, I bought his college degree, could he have joined our company otherwise?"

"If you continue like this, give the company back to me, you don't need to continue."

Brandon's face darkened, he looked at me for a long time, and finally gave in, "Caroline, I was wrong, I know I didn't cherish this opportunity, but this time it's really not my fault, it's all Shirley's."

Shirley looked at Brandon in disbelief, but he glared at her fiercely.

She could only kneel down, "Mrs. Jordan, it's all my fault, I shouldn't have followed you."

I stared at her, "Tell me, what was your purpose in following me? Do you want to drive a wedge between Brandon and me, and then take my place as Mrs. Jordan?"

Shirley remained silent, just shaking her head.

I stared at her, she couldn't refute because I had hit the mark.

"Fine, if you won't say, get out of our house. I don't need someone who wants to harm me in our home."

"You came to our house a few years ago, I paid you double the salary of other maids, and you still did this. I won't keep you!"

Seeing I was serious about kicking her out, Shirley quickly looked at Brandon.

But he had already shut his mouth, seeing no one speaking for her, Shirley knelt and kowtowed.

"I'm sorry, Mrs. Jordan, I was wrong, I didn't mean to take your place, I was just impulsive, please forgive me!"

She said, kowtowing heavily.

In no time, her forehead was bleeding, but she kept kowtowing, looking pitiful.

"Mrs. Jordan, I was wrong, please forgive me, Mrs. Jordan, I was really wrong!"

She kept kowtowing and speaking.

The scene looked particularly eerie.

I saw Paula standing at her room door, coldly watching the scene.

###chapter 58

I looked into Paula's eyes, and the way she looked at Shirley was devoid of any sympathy, as if she were looking at a dead object.

I began to wonder what could have happened between these two sisters to make Paula hate Shirley so much.

Shirley kept kowtowing, and the bloodstains on the floor grew more and more. In the end, she actually knocked herself unconscious.

I went to the kitchen, got a glass of water, and splashed it on Shirley's face.

She quickly woke up, and upon seeing me, instinctively tried to kowtow again.

"Stop kowtowing. Do you think I don't know what you're trying to do? You just want to get injured in our house so you can stay here openly."

"I'm telling you, it's not going to happen. No matter what, you have to leave today. I can't keep someone like you in my house anymore!"

Shirley looked to Brandon for help, but he just looked down, pretending not to see.

Anger flared in Shirley's eyes, and she gritted her teeth. "Mrs. Jordan, it wasn't my intention to follow you. It was because..."

Before she could finish, Brandon stepped forward and kicked Shirley, sending her sprawling on the floor, clutching her chest and coughing miserably.

"You still dare to make excuses? Are you going to say I ordered you to do it? It seems you really want to sow discord between us!"

I looked at Brandon, his usually refined face now filled with anger as he glared at Shirley. "You really have some nerve."

I knew Brandon was just worried that Shirley would reveal the truth, so he had no choice but to act.

Shirley seemed to come to her senses after Brandon's kick. She lowered her head and knelt again, saying to me, "Mrs. Jordan, as long as you let me stay, I'll do anything."

I said nothing, and Brandon, still glaring at her and breathing heavily, finally looked at me and said, "Caroline, although Shirley was wrong this time, she has done good work before. She took good care of the kids, didn't she?"

Brandon tried to use the kids to persuade me, not realizing that mentioning them only made me angrier. How dare he bring up the kids?

"You dare to mention that? I saw Shirley badmouthing me to the kids, making them afraid to get close to me so they would only recognize her!"

As soon as I said this, guilt filled Shirley's eyes.

Brandon glared at Shirley, as if blaming her for ruining his plans.

"Maybe you misheard? The kids were just unfamiliar with you because you were sick before."

I sneered, "Are you trying to cover for Shirley? Are you trying to get rid of me?"

Brandon shook his head repeatedly, speaking to me in a gentle tone, "No, Caroline, I just think this might be a misunderstanding. Maybe you misunderstood?"

I stood up and looked at Brandon. "If you think it's a misunderstanding, the kids can talk now. Why don't we ask them and see what they say? Let's see if you still think it's a misunderstanding."

Brandon was speechless. He knew that Shirley was likely to have done such things, and if the kids confirmed it, there would be no way to cover it up, and she would have to leave.

I looked at Brandon, my eyes filled with anger. "You don't care about me or the kids. You think it's fine for her to follow me and badmouth me to the kids. If nothing matters to you, then let's get a divorce. There's no point in us being together anymore!"

My words were heavy, and Brandon immediately understood my meaning. He quickly said, "No, Caroline, I didn't mean that. I just thought we were all used to Shirley. I didn't know what she did. If that's the case, then let her go."

Brandon glanced at Shirley, who started to tremble, as his look was particularly cold.

I looked at Shirley and gave her an ultimatum. "Tonight is your last night here. You have to move out first thing in the morning."

At this moment, Paula came downstairs, pretending to be innocent. "What's going on?"

I looked at Shirley. "Shirley tried to sow discord between us, so she's no longer our nanny. You should leave too. With Shirley gone, it's not appropriate for you to stay either."

Paula was stunned, not expecting the situation to affect her. Just as she was about to explain, Brandon impatiently waved his hand. "You leave with Shirley. I don't want to see either of you."

Paula bit her lip, looking at us with resentment, but ultimately went upstairs to pack her things.

As I went upstairs to my room, I heard the sound of Brandon slapping Shirley. It was a clear, crisp sound.

If I wasn't mistaken, Brandon must have been furious with Shirley.

After all, the person he had trusted had made a mistake and was now useless. He would have to find someone new and start over.

Most importantly, he couldn't continue to have someone follow me.

So Brandon could only take his anger out on Shirley.

I quietly opened a crack in the door and saw that no one was downstairs. Brandon had clearly taken Shirley away to punish her.

Just then, my door suddenly opened, and I broke out in a cold sweat.

I thought Brandon had caught me eavesdropping.

But to my surprise, it was Paula who came in.

"Mrs. Jordan, it's me."

I looked at Paula warily. She was just like Shirley, and who knew what she might do? It was better to be cautious.

She said, "Mrs. Jordan, you don't need to be on guard. I'm not here to harm you. I'm here to help you."

Of course, I didn't believe her. "Say what you need to say. I don't need any help."

"I slept with Mr. Jordan, and so did Shirley."

Paula said this without any hesitation, catching me off guard.

I showed no expression and looked at her. "Do you think I'll believe you?"

She took a deep breath. "Mr. Jordan has another wife outside, named Elora, and you know their child, Jason."

"You've mentioned before that Elora's husband is also named Jordan and is also in the construction business. And you've never met her husband. How could it be such a coincidence?"

She looked at me earnestly and asked, "Have you never suspected?"

I said nothing, letting her continue.

Paula glanced outside, making sure Brandon and Shirley hadn't come up, then took my hand. "I'm willing to be Mrs. Jordan's weapon and help you with anything."

I looked at her, unable to discern her true intentions.

She said, "As long as I can get rid of Shirley, I'll do anything."

###chapter 59

I looked at Paula's face and curiously asked, "What kind of deep-seated hatred do you have with Shirley that makes you hate her so much?"

Paula gritted her teeth, her eyes seemingly lost in memories.

"If you had experienced such things in your childhood, you wouldn't forget them either."

Paula then told me about their past.

It turned out that when the Ross family parents came to the city to work, they had no choice but to leave the young Shirley at home.

As a result, they had their second child, Paula, in the city.

The Ross family parents didn't plan to have any more children, so they got sterilized. They doted on Paula, their daughter, and kept her by their side.

When Shirley grew up, she needed to go to school.

The Ross family parents had no choice but to bring Shirley to live with them. However, Shirley had grown up in the countryside, neglected by her grandparents, and assumed Paula had the same experience.

But to her surprise, Paula had her own room, while Shirley had to sleep on a makeshift bed. She was extremely jealous of Paula.

So, when she was in middle school, she met James, a guy from outside the school, and instructed him to rape her younger sister Paula and take photos.

From then on, Paula, who was once cherished, became like trash trampled in the mud.

After hearing this, I didn't know how to feel.

The stupidity of the Ross family parents caused the harm to these sisters, but what did that have to do with me? This wasn't a reason for Shirley to hurt me.

I looked at Paula, "You know you also seduced Brandon, right?"

Paula lowered her head in remorse, "I know, my sins are unforgivable, so I'm willing to atone for them with this."

"At that time, I was blinded by anger. I just wanted to take everything Shirley had, so I made such an impulsive decision. I'm willing to atone for my sins in this way."

"I know you're not a simple person. I believe you have your own plans, and I know the company is yours. I'm willing to be your most powerful weapon."

Having someone like Paula on my side in the company would indeed be beneficial, but whether I could trust someone like Paula was still up for consideration.

"Wait for my message."

Paula nodded, got up, and left my room.

As she opened the door, Brandon also opened his door and, seeing Paula in my room, asked suspiciously, "What were you doing here?"

Paula shook her head and turned to leave.

After Brandon closed the door, he looked at me, "What did she say to you?"

I sneered, "She just told me how miserable her life was and wanted me not to kick her out."

"She and Shirley are both ungrateful people. Keeping her would only bring me more trouble, so I kicked her out without hesitation."

At this point, Brandon couldn't say much, just nodded, "Yes, you did the right thing. Since you kicked Shirley out, you might as well kick Paula out too."

I could see he was almost grinding his teeth, probably very reluctant to say this.

With Shirley gone, the new nanny I had asked Kathy to find could start working smoothly.

This was something I had previously discussed with her, so I quickly sent her a message.

Kathy understood my intention and soon replied that the new nanny would arrive tomorrow.

The next morning, Kathy called me, saying she had brought the new nanny to the entrance of the community.

The new nanny was a middle-aged woman named Holly Waverly, in her forties, and very efficient in her work.

I looked at Kathy, who winked at me as if to say, "I found her, you can trust her."

Only then did I nod. With Kathy's assurance, I could definitely trust Holly.

I questioned Holly about her past while sitting on the couch, and she answered everything.

At that moment, Brandon came downstairs and, seeing her, was taken aback, "Who is she?"

I said, "I asked Kathy to find a new nanny for me. She has a lot of experience and has raised two children."

Brandon immediately fell silent, looking at the leisurely Kathy, gritting his teeth, "Ms. Patel is really quick. I was planning to find a nanny myself, but you acted so fast!"

Kathy laughed, "Of course, it's not easy to find such a good nanny, so I had to bring her over quickly before someone else snatched her up."

I knew that if Brandon found a nanny, he would probably find someone like Shirley again, so I had to get the nanny in quickly so he couldn't say anything.

Sure enough, he remained silent and went straight to the garden to smoke, indicating he was very annoyed but couldn't show it.

I glanced at him and sneered.

At that moment, Shirley came downstairs with large bags.

Perhaps knowing she couldn't stay, she didn't even look at me and just left.

The bruises on her face were very noticeable, looking quite horrifying, probably from Brandon hitting her last night.

Paula followed Shirley, her gaze fleetingly landing on me. She silently watched for a while before getting into the car with Shirley.

Watching them leave, I felt as if a weight had been lifted from my heart.

From now on, there would be no more eyes watching me in this house, and I felt incredibly relieved.

Brandon also watched Shirley leave before turning back into the house.

I deliberately asked him, "Brandon, do you think Holly is a good nanny?"

Brandon, looking uninterested and helpless, said, "Whatever."

With that, he went into the study, not even bothering to listen to my conversation with Kathy.

I had Holly cook a meal, and she proved to be an excellent nanny. The meal was delicious, nutritious, and even included baby food.

The more I looked at Holly, the more I liked her. She quietly did her work and only smiled when taking care of the children, seeming to genuinely like them.

I finally felt relieved. After all, if she didn't like children, I wouldn't feel comfortable using her.

Brandon seemed to want to find fault with Holly, but after eating her food, he had nothing to say.

Compared to her, the food Shirley made could only be called barely edible.

So Holly stayed, and I could finally trust her with the children.

But I didn't let my guard down. Just because Shirley wasn't watching me didn't mean Brandon had stopped, so I couldn't expose myself easily.

I still went out with Kathy and Joanna and the other wealthy ladies.

Over time, Brandon stopped asking, even pretending not to notice when I went out for a day.

But this worried me the most. Would he give up trying to harm me?

###chapter 60

But before I could think it through, an unexpected guest suddenly arrived at our home.

On a day off, I watched Brett and the boy-girl twins watching cartoons, and the living room was bustling with activity.

Brandon was in the upstairs lounge, which at this moment was equivalent to him not being home.

I hadn't been this relaxed in a long time, and I was in a very good mood.

But who knew that when I looked outside, I saw Karen walking in.

She rudely pushed open the door, crossed her arms, and surveyed the living room with a frown: "Why is this place such a mess?"

My good mood instantly vanished. I restrained my smile and pretended not to see her, focusing on the TV.

Holly looked at Karen in surprise and asked, puzzled, "Who are you, ma'am?"

Karen frowned, looked Holly up and down, and her eyebrows shot up in anger: "Who are you calling ma'am? You're so much older than me, and you call me ma'am? Do you deserve it?"

Karen was draped in a shawl, carrying a designer bag on her arm, her hair curled, and wearing sunglasses on her nose, looking every bit like a nouveau riche.

"You..."

Holly, after being snapped at, looked at me helplessly: "Mrs. Caroline Jordan, this..."

I pulled her to sit down: "Holly, continue playing with the kids. This is Brandon's mother, and also my elder."

Holly immediately nodded and apologized to Karen: "I'm sorry, Mrs. Karen Jordan, I didn't recognize you. I just started here and didn't know you, I'm really sorry."

But who knew what Holly said to offend Karen again, as she pointed her red-painted nails at Holly: "Who are you? Where did you come from?"

Holly quickly replied: "I'm Mrs. Caroline Jordan and Mr. Jordan's nanny, and I help take care of the kids. You can just call me Holly."

"Well, I'm telling you now, you're fired."

With that, she pointed to the door: "Get out now!"

Holly was stunned and looked at me: "Mrs. Caroline Jordan, this..."

I frowned tightly, unable to watch any longer, and looked at Karen: "Mom, why are you doing this? I hired Holly, how can you just fire her?"

Karen glared: "What's wrong with her as a nanny? She can't even recognize me?"

"Even if she doesn't know me, she should recognize my aura. If she's that blind, she shouldn't be a nanny!"

I rolled my eyes. What aura? Karen and aura don't even belong in the same sentence.

"Mom, Brandon said you used to be a nanny too. Why are you picking on Holly? Can't you empathize with her? She just made a mistake."

Karen's facade of a wealthy family was shattered by my words, and she became furious: "Who did you say was a nanny?"

I shrugged innocently: "Brandon told me. He also said you were fired for eating food from the employer's fridge."

Karen's face turned all sorts of colors, quite a spectacle.

Holly couldn't help but laugh.

Karen, unable to vent her anger at me, turned her fury on Holly: "What are you laughing at? Who told you to laugh?"

"How dare you, as a nanny, laugh at your employer? Get out of this house now. This is my son Brandon's home!"

I protected Holly: "Mom, stop being unreasonable. Why are you here?"

"Unreasonable?"

Karen pointed at herself, incredulous: "Caroline, how dare you speak to your elder like that? Who gave you the courage?"

I remained expressionless and said calmly: "Mom, I'm just stating the facts. Holly is doing a good job here. Why are you trying to fire her?"

"Why do you care what I do? Don't I have the right to fire someone?"

"Aren't you spending Brandon's money now, which is essentially my money? Get her out now!"

I sneered and didn't say anything, instead calling Brandon upstairs.

"Mom, you should talk to Brandon about this."

When the call connected, Brandon sounded surprised: "Caroline? Why are you calling me from such a short distance?"

Before I could finish speaking, Karen grabbed the phone: "Brandon, come down quickly. Caroline is bullying me!"

She then threw the phone back to me, looking smug as if Brandon would come down and deal with me.

I shrugged indifferently, not planning to say anything. After all, if Brandon still wanted to attend Joanna's dad's dinner, he wouldn't dare offend me.

I didn't say anything, just shrugged.

Sure enough, Brandon hurried down after hearing the news, and Karen frowned: "Mom, why didn't you call before coming over?"

Karen shook her head angrily: "Why would I call? This is your home, which means it's my home too. I'm being bullied in my own home!"

I sneered. In Karen's eyes, no matter how much money I spent or how many children I had for their family, I was just an outsider.

Karen was indeed a heartless mother, giving birth to a heartless Brandon.

"Who bullied you? Did you misunderstand Caroline?"

Brandon frowned. He was already troubled recently, and now Karen was causing trouble, so he naturally wasn't in a good mood.

"Caroline, what's going on?"

I pointed to the uneasy Holly standing aside: "Mom wants to fire Holly, but I don't agree."

Brandon clicked his tongue and looked at Karen: "Mom, why do you want to fire her? She's doing a good job here!"

"Good job? She's not as good as Shirley before. Holly called me ma'am. How can she be a nanny?"

I sneered: "Of course, Holly doesn't know as much about being a nanny as you do, Mom. But experience is gained over time. You have to let Holly learn, right?"

Karen's hand trembled with anger as she pointed at me: "You unfilial woman, what did the Jordan family do to deserve someone like you..."

Before she could finish, Brandon saw my expression and quickly pulled Karen upstairs.

"Mom, come upstairs and talk."

He then winked at me: "Caroline, don't be mad. My mom is old and doesn't know how to talk. I'll talk to her now."

He pulled Karen upstairs, and I followed.

Maybe Brandon was so angry that he forgot to close the door.

"Mom, what are you doing? You were fine at home, why come here to bother Caroline?"

"What do you mean bother? Can't I say anything? Why can't I say anything to her?"

"You don't understand. Just say what you need to and then leave."

"Fine, fine. I see you've forgotten about me since you married Caroline. How dare you talk to me like this."

"I'm here to ask for that one million dollars!"

###chapter 61

"What do you mean, a million dollars?"

Brandon looked confused, but I got it right away.

Leaning against the wall, I couldn't help but laugh.

Joanna had mentioned a project with a 200% return on investment to Karen, and it seemed she hadn't forgotten.

"It's that money-making project I told you about before. Ms. Thorne is helping me with it. Hurry up and get the money."

Brandon's voice was strained and skeptical. "How can that be real? Did Joanna trick you? There's no way a project can make that much money."

"You don't know what you're talking about!" Karen snapped, her eyes wide with urgency. "Ms. Thorne is helping me. It must be information from her dad's side. You just don't know."

Karen had done many jobs in her early years but had never started a business, so she didn't understand the ways of commerce or even what a return on investment meant.

She only knew that if the daughter of a wealthy family was helping her with a money-making project, it had to be real.

Brandon, naturally, didn't believe it. "If that's the case, wouldn't those in charge have already taken all the good deals? Why would there be anything left for you?"

"What do you mean by that? Ms. Thorne and I are close. Is it wrong for her to think of me?" Karen, agitated, slammed her hand on the table and stood up.

Brandon glanced at the door and lowered his voice. "Mom, keep it down. I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a project that makes that much money. Do you trust your son or Ms. Thorne?"

Karen actually took a moment to think. "Ms. Thorne has no reason to lie to me. How could it not be real?"

Brandon frowned impatiently. "What if this Ms. Thorne is a fraud?"

"Impossible!"

"Just give me the money. You have money to buy Elora a villa but not for me? Then I'll go downstairs and ask Caroline for it!"

I was taken aback, then let out a cold laugh.

Where did Karen get the nerve to ask me for money?

Brandon quickly grabbed Karen's arm. "Mom, can you stop causing trouble? Why would you go to Caroline? Do you want all our issues to be exposed?"

Karen had clearly lost her composure, breathing heavily. "So, are you giving me the money or not?"

Brandon sighed helplessly. "Fine, wait a few days, and I'll transfer it to you."

Hearing this, Karen finally calmed down. "That's more like it. Transfer the money quickly, or I'll come back and make a scene."

Brandon's voice was utterly exhausted as he nodded. "Got it, Mom."

Maybe he only showed such patience when dealing with his unreasonable family, while with us, he was a different person entirely.

"By the way, how's Elora doing now?"

Karen snorted. "What do you think? She's still in the hospital. Who knows if she'll ever be able to have kids."

"Check on her when you can, to keep her on our side. We don't want her spreading rumors and ruining things for me."

Karen replied irritably, "Got it, got it."

"And later, go downstairs and say something nice to Caroline. I have a big deal coming up, and I might need her help. If you offend her now, and she refuses to help, it'll be a disaster."

"She wouldn't dare," Karen scoffed. "You're her husband. She wouldn't help someone else over you."

"The situation here is complicated. Just do as I say."

Hearing them getting ready to come downstairs, I quickly returned to the living room.

Holly, the nanny, was entirely focused on the child, as if she hadn't noticed me going upstairs.

I was very pleased with her performance.

I went back to the room and handed Holly a gold necklace. "Holly, your neck looks a bit bare. This would suit you."

Holly looked up, her expression calm and respectful. "Thank you, Mrs. Jordan, but it's not necessary."

I took her hand and placed the necklace in it. "I said take it. You're doing a great job with the baby, and I'm happy."

Just then, Karen and Brandon came downstairs.

I didn't look at them, continuing to play with the baby.

Brandon cleared his throat behind me. "Caroline, Mom's leaving."

I finally looked up, addressing Karen. "Take care, Mom."

Karen seemed displeased with my attitude but remembered what Brandon had said and forced a smile. "Taking care of the baby alone must be hard. If you need any help, just ask me. I have more experience."

The insincere smile and superficial concern made me uncomfortable, so I just nodded casually.

Karen seemed equally uncomfortable and quickly left after saying that.

When Brandon returned, he sat beside me, asking me not to be mad at his mom.

I pretended to be magnanimous, patting his hand. "Don't worry, Brandon. I'm not mad anymore."

With Holly's help, taking care of the baby wasn't as chaotic as before.

Finally, I could get a good night's sleep.

But just before bed, I received a text from Paula: "Mrs. Jordan, Shirley is heading your way. I don't know what she's up to, but she seems to have a key to your house."

I was stunned, realizing I hadn't taken Shirley's key back when she left.

It was nearly midnight. What could she be up to, sneaking over alone?

Brandon was already in bed after his shower, while I pretended to sleep.

Once he was asleep, I moved to a shadowy spot on the second floor, standing where no one could see me.

Sure enough, within half an hour, Shirley arrived at the door and skillfully unlocked it.

I watched as she poured something into my cup and then started searching for something.

She kept looking around until she headed upstairs.

I turned on the light, startling Shirley, who screamed in surprise.

The noise woke Holly and Brandon, who came out of their rooms, looking confused.

Brandon's face darkened as he approached Shirley. "What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you we have nothing to do with you anymore?"

Shirley, terrified, crouched on the floor, trembling.

I took the key from her hand. "This is our house key. I almost forgot she still had one."

"Tell me! What are you doing here?"

It took Shirley a while to respond, her eyes sincere. "I was looking for something. I wasn't stealing. I just left a pair of earrings in the living room and wanted to get them back."

Earrings? But I had just seen her put something in my cup.

###chapter 62

Shirley's been our housekeeper for years. She definitely knows which one is my water cup.

She wants to kill me!

I glared at her, waiting to see what she'd say.

Shirley kept waving her hands, trying to explain why she was here.

"I swear, I just came to find something, Mr. Brandon Jordan, Mrs. Caroline Jordan. Please believe me, I have no other intentions."

I crossed my arms. "How do we know you're not here to steal something? Or maybe you're holding a grudge and trying to poison us. Shirley, you're not trustworthy at all."

Seeing I wasn't convinced, Shirley turned to Brandon, pleading.

"Mr. Jordan, I really have no other intentions. I just came to get something. Please, you have to believe me."

"I was wrong. I promise I won't come again!"

Shirley kept apologizing, and Brandon stared at her for a long time with a stern expression. "This better not happen again. Now get out!"

Just as she was about to go downstairs, I stopped her.

"Why? She broke into our house. Why should we just let her go? I'm calling the police and having her taken to the station."

At the mention of the police, both Brandon and Shirley looked a bit panicked.

After all, the dirty things they did in private would be exposed under the interrogation room lights.

"Mrs. Jordan, I was wrong. I didn't do anything. Please don't send me to the police!"

Brandon frowned and looked at me. "Caroline, maybe we should just let her go. We've known Shirley for so many years, we know her character. She probably isn't lying."

Here it comes, he's already starting to defend Shirley.

I stayed silent, listening.

"She probably just got confused and didn't dare to greet us, so she snuck in at night. Let's take her key and let her go."

"Yes, Mrs. Caroline Jordan, Mr. Brandon Jordan is right. I really had no ill intentions. I just wanted to find my earring. Can you forgive me?"

Seeing her start to plead again, my gaze fell on the cup she had touched downstairs. I didn't say anything.

Shirley looked guilty, not daring to meet my eyes, and kept begging weakly.

I stayed silent for a while, and both Brandon and Shirley watched me.

"Fine, but this better not happen again. I'm only letting this slide because you've worked for us for so many years."

Shirley thanked me repeatedly, then scrambled out of the house.

I watched her leave, noticing the malicious look she gave me before she left. She thought I would soon be affected by whatever powder she had put in my cup.

Brandon yawned and patted my shoulder. "Caroline, go back to sleep. It's late."

I nodded. "Okay, you go ahead. I'll go downstairs for a drink of water."

Brandon nodded and left, leaving me and the housekeeper Holly in the living room.

I went downstairs and looked at my cup, picking it up to inspect it.

There was a fine white powder on the rim, barely noticeable unless you looked closely.

Holly watched me for a while, and I pointed to the cup. "Holly, wrap this up for me. Make sure you don't touch it directly, use something to handle it."

She understood immediately and nodded, going to find the tools.

I went back upstairs to my room.

The reason I didn't expose Shirley was because Brandon had spoken up for her.

I knew how ruthless and heartless he could be, but he was willing to speak for Shirley. There had to be more to it.

Either Shirley had something on Brandon that scared him, or he still had use for her.

Either way, I needed to keep Shirley around.

The next day, I slept until noon.

Brandon had been staying home these days, seemingly trying to appease me.

What he didn't know was that just looking at him made me sick.

But today, someone unexpected came to the house.

When Holly brought the person in, I could hardly believe my eyes.

I saw a woman with silver hair but a spirited demeanor, and I whispered, "Mom?"

I was afraid it was just a dream.

Kelly came forward and grabbed my hand, looking me over carefully. "Caroline, why have you lost so much weight?"

In an instant, all my pretense, all the hard shell I had built around myself, shattered.

I felt like a lost child who had finally found her way home, and I threw myself into my mom's arms, crying out, "Mom!"

Kelly patted my shoulder. "Brandon said you were sick, that's why you didn't want to contact me. Caroline, you have no idea how much I've worried about you."

I cried in her arms for a long time, wanting to tell her everything I had been through, but I knew I couldn't.

My gaze fell on the man behind Kelly. He was a middle-aged man, thin and gaunt, with sunken cheeks. He looked particularly frail, but his eyes shone with a strange light, like a deep abyss.

This must be the housekeeper Brandon had found for my mom.

"Mom, why are you here?"

Brandon came down the stairs, his voice slightly surprised.

I looked at him, seeing that although his mouth was open in shock, there was no surprise in his eyes.

I was sure that Kelly's visit was arranged by Brandon.

He had always kept me from contacting my mom, so why the sudden change?

It had to be something he cared about deeply.

My eyes widened as I realized.

Urban renewal!

Sure enough, once Kelly knew I was feeling better, she pulled a document out of her bag.

An urban renewal notice.

"Caroline, our family home is up for urban renewal."

I glanced at Brandon, seeing his eyes glued to the document, his greed almost tangible.

Kelly held my hand and sighed. "Your dad always told me, no matter what happens to our company, we mustn't sell the house. He believed that the government would have policies for that area in the future, and it would become your capital. That money would ensure your happiness for life."

Listening to her, I couldn't help but cry. The love of my parents was so genuine, and compared to Brandon, they were like gods to me.

Brandon cleared his throat. "Mom, no matter what, stay for a meal. We can talk more after."

I glanced at him but didn't say anything. I agreed with the suggestion.

After all, it had been a long time since I had a meal with Kelly.

Once Holly had prepared the meal, Kelly looked at her with a strange expression. "I remember your housekeeper used to be a young girl, right?"

I nodded, keeping my expression neutral. "We changed. Mom, let's eat first. I'll tell you everything that happened after the meal."

###chapter 63

After dinner, I pulled Kelly into my room for a chat.

"So, who's that guy following you around?" I asked.

Kelly smiled, the gentle wrinkles at the corners of her eyes deepening. "Brandon hired a butler for me. He said it wasn't safe for me to live alone, so he got that man. His name is Eugene Bailey."

I nodded, making a mental note of the name. I'd have Simon look into it when he had the chance.

Hearing her say she lived alone made my heart ache.

I wished I could always be there for Kelly, even bring her to live with me, but I couldn't.

I was barely able to protect myself. What if I couldn't protect Kelly? Maybe staying at home was the best option for her right now.

While Kelly and I were chatting, Brandon kept coming in, bringing tea and trying to be helpful.

Kelly seemed pleased with Brandon's behavior, holding my hand and telling me to cherish our life together.

I wanted to tell Kelly that Brandon was just putting on an act, that he was a jerk at heart.

But I couldn't say it.

Brandon, hearing Kelly's words, immediately put on a show, kneeling on the floor and pledging his loyalty.

"Mom, don't worry. I'll treat Caroline well for the rest of my life. I'll always cherish her."

Kelly was moved to tears, while I could only roll my eyes.

In the afternoon, Brett came back from his tutoring session and saw Kelly sitting on the couch. He seemed a bit confused.

His small hands fidgeted, and his round eyes curiously observed the person on the couch.

The sight broke my heart.

If it weren't for Brandon, my child wouldn't be in a situation where he barely recognized Kelly.

I blinked back tears, nudging Brett forward. "Do you recognize her? Who is this?"

Brett looked for a long time before softly saying, "It's Grandma."

Kelly's eyes filled with tears, and she rushed to hug Brett, her face beaming with joy. "I knew Brett wouldn't forget me. I've been thinking about you every day this past year."

"Look at the toys I bought for you."

Brett, being a child, was quickly won over by the toys and happily started playing.

I stood by, watching this long-missed scene, feeling a deep sense of happiness.

It had been a long time since I felt this way.

The only thing that disgusted me was Brandon standing beside me, watching the scene.

I looked at his face, seeing the fake gentle mask he wore while watching them play, but his eyes were cold.

I didn't know what he was thinking. Was he moved by this scene?

That evening, after dinner, I wanted Kelly to stay the night. But Eugene, who had been silent, suddenly stepped forward and said something to Kelly.

Kelly's smile froze, and she sighed helplessly.

"Caroline, I can't stay. I have to go back tonight. I have things to do tomorrow."

I frowned at Eugene, who remained expressionless.

I worried that Eugene had threatened Kelly, but her expression didn't show any signs of being threatened.

At that moment, I saw Eugene and Brandon exchange a look, sharing some unspoken emotion.

I realized that Brandon didn't want Kelly to stay, so he found an excuse for her to leave.

I was filled with overwhelming hatred.

I had to make Brandon return everything he took from me and get him out of my life for good.

But for now, I had no choice but to painfully see Kelly off.

On the way to the car, Brandon accompanied me as I walked Kelly out. Before getting in the car, she said, "Brandon, wait here. I want to talk to Caroline alone."

It was a normal request, and Brandon had no right to refuse. He could only watch as I got into the car.

In the back seat, Kelly held my hand and glanced at Brandon outside.

"Caroline, I don't know how Brandon treats you. Only you know your marriage. But I advise you to be careful. Don't give everything away foolishly. The money from the urban renewal of this house is yours. Don't think about using it to support the family. Keep it for yourself."

I was stunned, looking at Kelly with confusion. "Mom, weren't you just..."

The contrast was too stark.

My mom shook her head. "This is a significant amount of money. It can make people lose their minds. Even if Brandon loved you before, can you be sure he's good to you now not because of this money?"

"So listen to me, be careful."

I nodded and said goodbye to Kelly.

As I got out of the car, Eugene got in and drove away without hesitation.

I watched Kelly's eyes looking back at me from the car, and I finally broke down, squatting on the ground and crying.

Brandon came over to help me up. "It's okay, Caroline. I know you miss Mom, but you can see her again after you get better."

He said, trying to pull me up. I angrily pushed his hand away. "Don't touch me!"

Brandon was stunned, standing there with a deep look in his eyes, not knowing what to think.

I quickly realized I had lost control of my emotions. I wiped my tears, holding back my pain, and apologized to Brandon.

"I'm sorry, Brandon. I just couldn't hold it in. I feel like it will be a long time before I see my mom again."

"So I lost control of my emotions."

Brandon nodded, understanding. "It's okay. I understand. It's not a big deal."

"We're husband and wife. There's no need to apologize. You can take out your frustrations on me."

He gently wiped my tears. "Caroline, once our overseas market stabilizes, we can bring Mom to live with us. Don't be sad now."

I nodded, not saying anything, and followed Brandon out of the garage.

Suddenly, he asked, "Caroline, what did you and Mom talk about in the car? I saw her looking at me."

I smiled. "Of course, she told me to cherish our life together, to control my temper, and not always make you give in to me."

Maybe living with Brandon for so long had made me a good liar.

Brandon nodded, clearly believing me.

He gently said, "It's okay, Caroline. I like your temper."

###chapter 64

When I got back to my room that night, a thought hit me out of nowhere.

With the house renovation and the dinner with Joanna's dad coming up, why not use this chance to get Brandon to transfer some of the money back to me?

In the days that followed, I started going out a lot. Each time before leaving, I'd make sure to mention I was going out with Joanna.

If Brandon wasn't home, I wouldn't come back all day. I'd have Holly tell him in the evening that I was out with Joanna and wouldn't be back for a while.

Brandon, of course, was thrilled that I was spending more time with Joanna, so he never complained.

Until he subtly asked me about the dinner Joanna's dad was organizing.

I pretended to be annoyed and replied, "Do you think it's that easy? If you want to go, don't you need to give Joanna and her dad some gifts? What do I have to give? Do we have any money?"

Brandon was taken aback by my words. I turned to him and said, "Also, you need to transfer all our money back to me, or I'll go to the company and check the accounts myself. I don't care about anything else, but touching that money is the bottom line."

Brandon's face stiffened, but he smiled and nodded. "Of course, Caroline. Would I lie to you?"

"How about I transfer you half a million dollars first? You can use it to build a good relationship with Joanna's family, and I'll follow up on the remaining payments."

I rolled my eyes. "Half a million dollars? You might as well not bother."

Brandon was puzzled. "Why?"

I sneered. "Half a million dollars is nothing. It won't even make an impression. We might end up giving the money and still not get a spot at the dinner. Isn't that a loss?"

Brandon was stunned by my words and nodded. "You're right. How much do you think we need?"

I made a rough estimate and said, "Transfer me a million dollars first. I'll see how it goes, but we might need more later."

Brandon was clearly shocked by the amount. No matter how much he earned, he still had a small-town mentality and thought giving away that much money was a waste.

He explained his situation to me, but I couldn't help but scoff. "What are you talking about? Gifts?"

"Do you think you're in a position to give gifts? This money is for me and Joanna to spend. If you want to impress Joanna, you need to think about that."

Seeing Brandon's pained expression, I couldn't help but sneer. "Are you having second thoughts? Do you think it's not worth it?"

"Do you know how much profit you can make from one collaboration with Joanna's dad? Can't you do the math?"

"The money you invest now will come back to you several times over. So what's the big deal?"

Sure enough, Brandon fell silent, thinking it over for a long time before nodding. "Caroline, you go ahead and spend time with Joanna. I'll transfer the money to your account. If it's not enough, let me know."

Although this money was far less than what Brandon had taken from me, I was satisfied. At least some money was starting to come back into my pocket.

This was a good sign!

The next day, before heading out, I made sure to tell Brandon, "Hey, I'm going to have afternoon tea with Ms. Thorne. If you need anything, just leave me a message. Don't call."

Brandon's eyes lit up, and he nodded eagerly. "Caroline, make sure to get on her good side. Maybe she can get us into her dad's dinner."

I sneered, my tone dripping with sarcasm. "Sure, as long as you don't embarrass me or mess up my plans."

I was referring to the recent incident with Shirley. Brandon had learned his lesson from that, so he quickly shook his head.

"Don't worry, nothing will go wrong."

I left the house and got into Kathy's car. As soon as I was in, I couldn't wait to tell her about the past few days.

Kathy was thrilled to hear that Brandon had started transferring money to me. She grabbed my hand and laughed. "That's fantastic news."

"With Brandon's greedy nature, he'll eventually have to give it all back!"

I nodded in agreement. "But I need your help with something. Do you have a friend who works at a bank?"

Kathy nodded without hesitation. "What do you need?"

"Can you ask your friend to open an account for me, one that's not in my name? I want to transfer the money there."

"This money is still considered marital property. Only by transferring it out will it truly be mine."

Kathy waved her hand dismissively. "No problem. Consider it done."

With Kathy's assurance, I felt much more at ease. This was a method I had thought of on the fly.

If Brandon could transfer assets, why couldn't I?

Using the same tactics against him, I'd make sure he tasted his own medicine.

Kathy drove us to a restaurant where Joanna was already waiting.

Over time, Joanna and I had become good friends.

I explained the current situation to her, and she nodded. "You already have the upper hand. With my support and the house renovation, Brandon won't dare mess with you. He'll have to treat you well."

Kathy agreed. "That's true, but Caroline, you still need to be careful. Brandon is cunning. You can't predict what he's thinking, so you need to be prepared."

I felt the same way. Although I had the advantage now, if Brandon tried any tricks, I wouldn't be able to resist.

In short, my ability to fight back was still too weak. I needed to grow stronger.

After lunch with Joanna and Kathy, Kathy had to leave for something urgent, leaving just Joanna and me.

Suddenly, a man in black appeared silently beside Joanna and whispered something in her ear.

After he finished, she turned to me and smiled. "Someone's been following us."

I was stunned, immediately realizing it was someone Brandon had sent. He still didn't trust me, or he wouldn't have had me followed.

"What do you think we should do?"

Joanna looked at me and asked, "Since he likes to watch, let's give him a show. He'll have to watch and still willingly give us money."

Joanna chuckled. "Exactly what I was thinking."

"By the way, Karen recently got some money and started asking about my project."

I remembered Karen causing trouble a while back, having gotten money from Brandon.

"Just refuse her. She'll think she missed an opportunity and feel miserable, but she won't dare ask you about it."

###chapter 65

After saying goodbye to Joanna, I headed home.

Brandon, always in the know about my whereabouts, kept sneaking glances at me, trying to figure out how my meeting with Joanna had gone.

I ate quietly, my face giving nothing away.

The more Brandon wanted to know, the more I shut him out.

Eventually, he couldn't hold back any longer and sat down beside me. "Caroline, how'd it go with Joanna today? What was her vibe?"

I was painting my nails, something I hadn't done since I got sick. Feeling relaxed today, I decided to bring out the nail polish and paint my toes.

"It went fine."

My vague response left Brandon even more confused. He wanted to ask directly but was afraid of making me angry, growing increasingly anxious.

"And about the dinner meeting..."

"Joanna said the guest list isn't finalized yet. We'll have to wait a bit longer."

Brandon finally couldn't contain himself and stood up. "What does she mean by that? The event's almost here, and she still hasn't decided on the attendees. Is she messing with me?"

I let out a cold laugh and gave Brandon a pointed look. "Why are you in such a hurry? Joanna's current attitude is because of what you did back then."

"The fact that Joanna hasn't outright rejected me means there's still hope. If you had really pissed her off that time, she wouldn't be in contact with me at all, understand?"

Brandon frowned, deep in thought. "So, the less news we have, the better the news?"

I nodded noncommittally. "Exactly."

"But..." Brandon still seemed hesitant.

I cut him off sharply. "No buts. Your most important task right now is to transfer the money back into the account. If even a cent is missing, you can forget about being the general manager."

At this, Brandon fell silent, knowing he was in the wrong.

"Alright, got it."

I lay back on the bed, and Brandon quickly sidled up to me, his hands roaming over my body.

I suppressed my disgust. "I'm really tired today."

Brandon chuckled. "I'll do the work. You just relax and enjoy."

I frowned, thinking of a way to reject him.

Just then, his leg brushed against me, and I felt the rough, bumpy texture of a scar.

I quickly got up and turned on the light, pulling down Brandon's pajama pants. His ankle was covered in noticeable red bumps, looking particularly nasty.

"What is this?" I asked, staring at the scars.

Brandon shrugged. "Probably an allergic reaction. It just appeared recently. I didn't think much of it. It'll go away in a few days."

"No way. What if it's an infection?"

I insisted on taking a photo of Brandon's leg. "I'll send this to the doctor to see if you need any medication. We can't delay treatment."

Seeing me busy, Brandon lost interest and soon fell asleep.

I took the opportunity to send the photo to Simon. "Can you check what kind of disease causes these symptoms?"

Simon quickly called me back. I glanced at the sleeping Brandon and went to the bathroom to answer.

His voice was serious. "Where did you take this photo?"

"On Brandon's leg. I suspect it's..."

Syphilis...

Sure enough, Simon confirmed my suspicion. "Yes, it's syphilis. Do not have sex with him. It's highly contagious!"

I took a deep breath. "Don't worry. Just the sight of him makes me sick..."

I never imagined Brandon would contract such a filthy disease.

I recalled the messages on his other WhatsApp account with various women. He must have caught it from one of them.

Luckily, it was a recent infection and had nothing to do with me.

For safety, I scheduled a full-body checkup for the next day.

In the morning, Brandon asked about his leg at the breakfast table.

I sipped my coffee, keeping a straight face. "The doctor said it looks like a severe allergic reaction from the photo."

Brandon was taken aback. "What should I do?"

"I'm taking Kathy to the hospital today. I'll pick up some medication for you."

Brandon nodded. "Thanks, honey. I'll drive you to the hospital later."

After breakfast, Brandon drove me and Brett separately.

At the hospital entrance, I watched Brandon's car drive away before Kathy emerged from behind a pillar.

"What's up? Why the sudden full-body checkup? Did Brandon drug you again?"

I shook my head. "I suspect Brandon has syphilis. Even though it's a recent infection, I want to be sure and get checked."

Kathy made a disgusted face. "That disgusting man. It's bad enough he sleeps around, but to drag you into it? Gross."

I felt nauseous too but kept my composure for the checkup.

While waiting for the results, Kathy looked at me worriedly. "You haven't slept with him recently, right?"

I shook my head. I hated him too much to even consider it.

Thankfully, the results showed I hadn't contracted any diseases. Brandon had caught it after I got sick.

Relieved, I went to the clinic to get some unrelated medication to give him.

Kathy also breathed a sigh of relief. "We should celebrate with a good meal."

I couldn't refuse her, so I messaged home, saying I'd eat out.

Kathy had reserved a table at a restaurant. We sat by the window and suddenly saw a familiar face outside.

Kathy nudged me. "Look who it is."

I looked and was surprised to see Elora.

I hadn't seen her since her miscarriage. Now, she looked lively and healthy.

"She recovered quickly from her miscarriage, didn't she?"

I shook my head, watching Elora.

"Is she waiting for someone? Could it be Brandon?"

"Probably not. If she were meeting Brandon, she'd go to her place. Why wait on the street?"

###chapter 66

Just as Kathy and I were speculating, we saw her suddenly light up and head towards someone, like she had found the person she was waiting for.

Kathy and I looked over and saw Elora, arm-in-arm with a tall, slender man, happily entering the hotel across the street.

Kathy and I exchanged a look, both of us in disbelief.

Elora had another man?

I suddenly remembered Simon telling me that Elora and Earl had been to a hotel before. Although he didn't catch them doing anything, it was now pretty obvious what was going on.

"Elora just can't stand being alone, always hooking up with someone. I wonder if Brandon knows."

Brandon probably didn't know. Otherwise, with his temper, Elora wouldn't be living so freely.

Kathy suddenly had a wild idea. "Do you think Brandon's illness could have been transmitted by Elora?"

I shook my head. "No way. From what I know, Brandon has a private WhatsApp account filled with chats with various women. I only glanced at it briefly and saw dozens of them. It's likely one of them."

Kathy grimaced in disgust. "Wow, what a piece of work."

We hadn't had time to record anything when we first saw Elora, and it was too late to do so now. So, I decided to wait for her to come out and record it then.

Kathy didn't have anything else to do today, so she decided to stay with me.

An hour later, Elora and the stranger emerged from the hotel. I quickly took out my phone and recorded a video of them leaving the hotel and flirting at the entrance.

Kathy frowned. "Didn't Elora just have a miscarriage? And she's already out looking for someone to hook up with?"

"I can't take it anymore, Caroline. Can we teach her a lesson? This is too frustrating."

I couldn't help but laugh at Kathy's words. "We can consider it."

Kathy immediately called Simon for advice.

Simon, quick-witted as always, soon came up with a plan. "The best way to get back at her is to expose her affairs. Elora seems to like wealthy men, so you can use that against her."

"Like getting caught by one of the men's wives and getting beaten up in public. Doesn't that sound satisfying?"

Kathy nodded enthusiastically. "Yes, I get it. I'll find someone right now."

She hung up and started searching through her WhatsApp contacts, too excited for me to stop her.

She called someone. "Hey, what's the name of that guy whose wife is super fierce? Kurt Lowe? Got it!"

Kathy quickly looked up his name and showed it to me.

"This guy is perfect."

I glanced at her phone screen and saw a picture of a thin, sinister-looking man.

"Kurt is a real estate developer, very wealthy."

"Usually, middle-aged businessmen like him have a few mistresses, but Kurt is different. He made his fortune by marrying his boss's daughter, so he never dared to leave his wife. But men can't always control themselves."

Kathy leaned in conspiratorially. "Apparently, once Kurt's wife caught him with a mistress and chased him around the neighborhood with a knife. Such a big shot, and he lost all his dignity."

"So if Elora hooks up with Kurt, his wife definitely won't let her off."

Seeing Kathy so excited and ready to execute her plan, I had no choice but to agree.

After parting ways with Kathy, I went home and tossed some random ointment to Brandon.

"The doctor said this should do the trick."

Brandon believed me and immediately applied a layer of the ointment.

He probably didn't know he had syphilis. If he did, there would be quite a show to watch.

And this show had to have everyone present-Karen, Elora, Shirley, Paula. The more people who knew, the better.

Meanwhile, I brought Brandon some news that thrilled him.

"Joanna agreed to let you attend her dad's dinner party. She'll send the invitation in a few days."

Brandon was stunned and stood up in disbelief. "She really agreed?"

I looked at him, annoyed. "Of course. Do you think I've been shopping and dining with Joanna for fun? Haven't I been persuading her?"

Brandon quickly hugged me. "Thank you, honey. What would I do without you? When our business expands overseas, I'll help you explore new markets abroad while you manage things here."

I couldn't help but smirk internally. Keep dreaming. Let's see if you even live to see that day.

For the upcoming dinner with Joanna's dad, Brandon went all out, even getting a new suit tailored.

But his leg injury wasn't healing and was starting to spread.

Brandon looked at me in panic. "Caroline, did the doctor say what to do about this?"

I shook my head. "The doctor said just keep applying the ointment."

Brandon had no other options. He hated going to the hospital and had to rely on me.

In Brandon's mind, every hospital visit meant spending money, so he completely trusted me on this. Whatever I said to take, he took.

After discovering Brandon wanted to kill me, I once thought of using this weakness to get rid of him. But then I realized that would make me no different from him, so I gave up.

Because of his discomfort, Brandon had been going to bed early, giving me more free time.

Today, I got a call from Simon, which I hadn't received in a while.

I went to the bathroom to answer and couldn't help but tease him.

"Did you take on another job? Why haven't you called me in so long?"

Simon chuckled. "I've been working on your task. How could I dare call you otherwise?"

"Task? What task?"

"You've been looking for Asher, right? I found him."

I was shocked. "Where?"

"Tomorrow at 2 PM, come to the abandoned factory. I'll introduce you to someone."

Receiving such good news, I was too excited to sleep that night, tossing and turning in bed, much to Brandon's annoyance.

###chapter 67

The next morning, after dropping Brett off at school, I decided to drive around town for a bit.

Sure enough, after taking a few side streets, I noticed a car tailing me.

This must be someone Brandon sent to follow me.

I drove in circles for a while, then suddenly pulled into an underground parking garage, turned off all the lights, and sat in the darkness.

It didn't take long for the car following me to arrive, but they seemed confused in the pitch-black garage.

They couldn't tell which car was mine and which belonged to someone else.

After waiting for a long time, I finally saw the car leave. I quickly drove out and headed to the address Simon had given me.

It was an abandoned factory, completely deserted, with signs of relocation everywhere. The ground was overgrown with weeds, adding to the desolate atmosphere.

Just then, Simon emerged from a dilapidated building. "No one followed you, right?"

I quickly explained what had happened, and Simon nodded, not wasting any time. "I have a surprise for you today. Look over there!"

Following Simon's direction, I saw a familiar figure step out of the shadows.

I rushed forward, grabbing the disheveled man's hand. "Asher, what happened to you?"

Asher took a moment to recognize me. "Caroline?"

Tears welled up in my eyes as I hugged his arm. "Asher, where have you been all these years?"

Asher and I had known each other since we were kids. Though we were childhood friends, we were more like siblings.

When my dad handed the company over to me, it was Asher's support that kept it afloat.

So, Asher held a special place in my heart.

Not finding him these past few days, I had prepared myself for the worst, but I still couldn't accept it.

I was ready to face reality, but Simon had actually found Asher.

He looked so worn out, a far cry from the confident man he used to be.

"Asher, what have you been through all these years?"

Asher sighed deeply and sat down on a bench.

Simon sat nearby. "You have no idea how hard it was to find Asher. I pride myself on finding anyone, but he was a challenge."

I quickly thanked Simon. Finding Asher was a huge help, and I planned to compensate Simon generously once everything was over.

Even if it meant paying a fortune in detective fees.

Asher nodded, looking at me. "Your friend is quite impressive."

I couldn't wait any longer and asked Asher what had happened.

Asher began to recount how Brandon had handled things after I left.

Elora had become Brandon's assistant, helping him a lot, and quickly secured her position in the company.

When I handed over all my responsibilities to Brandon, he used the opportunity to observe the preferences of the higher-ups.

He then exploited these preferences to get rid of them, claiming it was to bring in new blood.

But replacing old employees with new ones wasn't easy.

Everyone was smart and not easy to deal with.

Brandon set them up, getting them all sent to prison by reporting false accounts and calling in auditors.

The company's finances were in shambles, and Brandon fired everyone involved.

Asher was the only one I could find; the others had disappeared.

I quickly realized something. "But Asher, that doesn't explain why you're in this state."

He shook his head slowly. "I was furious and went to confront Brandon."

But Brandon didn't care. He had Asher's leg broken and sent him to court.

Asher was sentenced to a year in prison but was released early for good behavior.

However, no one would hire an ex-convict accountant, or anyone with a criminal record, for that matter.

Rejected everywhere, Asher didn't dare go home or face me, eventually ending up here with nothing.

I was furious hearing this.

I never imagined it would come to this, and Brandon's cruelty had ruined Asher's life, sending him to prison during the prime of his life.

All because of Brandon.

I wanted to go back and kill him right then, but Asher and Simon stopped me.

"Even if you want to punish him, now's not the time. What's the rush?"

I had to calm down and listen to their next steps.

Asher continued, "Before Simon found me, I had given up on revenge. My life felt meaningless. If someone as evil as Brandon could have a happy family while I lost everything, what's the point?"

I looked at Asher with sympathy. He had never suffered like this before, and it must have been unbearable for him to reach this point.

"I thought about finding you, but you were never home, or you were asleep."

I shook my head, explaining, "During that time, Brandon had drugged me. I was bedridden, unable to fight back."

"If I had known what you were going through, I would have fought Brandon to the end."

Asher shook his head gently, his eyes soft. "It's all in the past."

I glared with determination. "No, it's not over for me. Asher, I will get revenge for you. Brandon ruined the best years of your life. Are you willing to let that go?"

Asher lowered his head for a long time, then slowly shook it.

No, he wasn't willing. He had been a rising star, only to end up in prison. How ironic.

And that despicable Brandon kept climbing, reaching the same level as me.

"Alright, we'll get our revenge on Brandon and make him pay for everything."

I then looked at Asher. "Asher, come work at my company. Stop doing this. Look at you, you're covered in injuries. You'll wear yourself out."

Asher bit his lip but eventually accepted my suggestion.

Watching your enemy thrive is worse than killing them.

###chapter 68

I looked at Asher and couldn't help but cry for him.

Asher, however, tried to comfort me. "Hey, Caroline, don't cry. I'm back now, okay?"

"Caroline, there's something important I haven't told you. Do you know Brandon has a sister?"

I nodded. "Yeah, Renee. From what I know, Brandon doesn't really like her."

To my surprise, Asher shook his head. "Caroline, you're only seeing the surface. I think Brandon's position in the Jordan family is actually below Renee's."

I was shocked and quickly asked what he meant.

Asher explained, "One of the reasons I'm in such bad shape is that after I left the company, I found a job. But one day, I was drugged and taken into a car."

"I thought I was being kidnapped, but they drove me to the border, like they were planning to take me out of the country."

"Out of the country? Kidnapping?"

The connection of these words gave me a bad feeling.

He nodded. "Exactly what you're thinking. The key point is, I heard Renee's voice in the car."

"Renee?"

"Why was she in the car? Was she kidnapped too?"

Asher shook his head. "Quite the opposite. I think Renee was a ringleader because the driver seemed to respect her a lot."

"I was the only one in the car. They said they were going to sell my organs abroad. For her to be involved with such an organization, Renee must be something else."

I was stunned, recalling Renee's face-an extremely seductive face, always heavily made up, and she acted without any scruples.

"No wonder she does drugs. It's rampant over there."

Asher nodded. "That makes sense."

But I was more worried about what happened next. "Asher, how did you escape?"

Asher continued, "Maybe because I was the only one, the driver wasn't cautious. When we reached the border, the driver went to the restroom. I took the chance to crash out of the car and ran to a nearby house."

"The family there called the police. When I returned with the police, the driver and the car were gone, probably fled."

"I wanted to identify Renee, so I told the police everything. But they said there wasn't enough evidence to arrest her yet, so they're just keeping an eye on her."

I took a deep breath, tears streaming down my face.

I never imagined that my decision years ago would not only cause many people in the company to lose their jobs but also lead to Asher suffering like this.

"Later, I noticed people frequently watching me. I suspected they were Renee's people trying to kidnap me again, so I had to live on the run, not daring to go home."

I couldn't hold back anymore and hugged him, crying and apologizing.

Asher patted my shoulder. "It's okay. I'm back now. It's all in the past."

Simon then spoke up. "I suspect everything in the Jordan family is connected to Renee."

"If Renee is involved in human organ trafficking abroad, she must be into drugs too. It's all crime, so why not do the more profitable ones?"

"And her funds might be coming from Brandon."

Using my money to commit crimes!

I was furious and wanted to call the police immediately.

Simon stopped me. "Hold on, don't get angry yet. The priority is to transfer all the money Brandon moved overseas back. Otherwise, it might end up funding their crimes."

I nodded. "I know. I recently met Joanna, the daughter of Treasury Secretary Oscar Thorne. She said she's willing to help me set up Brandon."

Hearing this, Simon nodded. "That's perfect. With her help, dealing with Brandon will be much easier."

I thought the same. Brandon might not trust me, but he would definitely trust Joanna.

"Alright, we can't stay here. Brandon has people following me. If they can't find me, they'll get anxious."

After talking with Asher and Simon, Simon drove Asher to a safe place he found for him.

I trusted Simon, so I drove to Brett's school.

Brett was about to finish school, so I found a nearby café to wait.

Suddenly, I saw Earl.

He was standing by a car, smoking, and his young face quickly attracted a lot of attention.

Usually, the people picking up kids from this elite school were successful middle-aged men.

But young and charming guys like Earl were rare.

I was curious. Why was Earl here? Was he picking up Brett?

But that couldn't be. If Brandon had asked Earl to pick up Brett, he would have told me.

I decided to wait and see who Earl was waiting for.

Soon, I saw Jason running out, arms open towards Earl.

Earl opened his arms and hugged him tightly.

The two of them looked very much alike.

I was stunned, remembering what Simon had told me about Elora and Earl's close relationship.

I had suspected that Jason might be Earl's child.

Now it seemed very likely. Why else would Earl come to pick him up?

I quickly took some photos as evidence.

Earl soon drove off with Jason, and Brett came out of the school.

I walked out of the café to meet him, saying, "Sweetie, can you help Mommy find out Jason's dad's number at school?"

"Mommy wants to meet him."

Brett didn't know why I was asking but agreed without hesitation.

"Okay, Mommy."

When we got home, Joanna had sent me an invitation, and I received her call.

I held Brett's hand and went home, where Brandon was already waiting.

I threw the invitation at him, not in a good mood.

Thinking about what he did to Asher made my anger uncontrollable.

Brandon picked up the invitation, thinking I was still mad about before, and quickly smiled, trying to please me.

"Thank you, honey. I couldn't have managed Joanna without you."

I sneered, taking off Brett's backpack, not wanting to talk to him.

But he came closer, kissing my cheek and telling Brett, "Brett, go to your room."

I knew what he wanted to do and felt disgusted.

"Wait, what room? You haven't done your homework yet."

###chapter 69

Brandon grumbled, "Can't you do that in your room?"

"He always reminds me that today's homework needs to be done with the parents. We can't let the kid develop a habit of lying from a young age, right?"

I said seriously.

Brandon was left speechless by my words, but he didn't seem upset. Instead, he kept looking at the invitation over and over.

I glanced at him. "This time, they said you can bring two assistants. Who are you planning to take?"

"I told you there will be a segment where you can talk to Oscar alone, and there might be foreign guests. You need to bring someone good with languages."

Brandon nodded. "I've already prepared. I'm taking Earl and someone from his team, a guy who studied abroad. He's very capable."

I had a hunch that the person with Earl was someone Simon had arranged. So I asked, "What's his name?"

"Francis Vasquez," he replied. I nodded, noting the name down to ask Simon about it later.

That night, Brandon was so happy about the invitation that he had a few drinks and quickly fell asleep.

I remembered what Simon and Asher had told me earlier. I felt that if Brandon was involved, there would definitely be some trace on his phone.

So, I took Brandon's phone and opened the second system.

This system held all of Brandon's secret passwords.

If he had contacted any foreign organizations, it would be through this system.

I opened WhatsApp and searched through it but found nothing.

"Could it be disguised?" I muttered, clicking into a random group.

To my surprise, this group was different. It was called "Car Club," but the people in it were posting strange things.

And the key point was, only a few people were posting while the others seemed to be muted.

It was as if these few people were issuing tasks.

I quickly took a photo and sent it to Simon. "Do you know what this is?"

Simon replied quickly, "Where did you get this?"

I honestly replied, "From Brandon's phone."

"It could be something, but I need to check his phone to be sure. It might take some time, about half an hour."

"Okay, when do you need it?"

Simon said, "Wait a few days, until after he attends that gathering. I need to prepare as well."

After finishing the chat with Simon, I put Brandon's phone back in its place.

Unexpectedly, he suddenly spoke, "Caroline..."

I was startled, breaking out in a cold sweat.

I thought Brandon had caught me looking at his phone and was thinking of how to explain it.

He mumbled again, "Caroline's money, I want..."

The rest was just incoherent mumbling. It turned out he was talking in his sleep.

My face turned cold immediately. I couldn't believe Brandon was dreaming about my money. How despicable.

I lifted his pant leg and kicked hard at the spot where he had a growth on his leg.

Brandon grimaced in pain in his sleep.

"If you dare think about my money, I'll kick you to death."

The next morning, Brandon asked me, "Honey, do you know why my leg hurt so much last night?"

I pretended to be clueless. "Maybe I bumped into you last night? Sorry about that."

Brandon waved it off. "It's okay, just be careful next time and don't touch that leg."

I replied, "Got it."

After breakfast with Brett, I took him to school.

Jason happened to be there too, just entering the school gate.

And nearby, I saw Earl's car flash by, the same one I saw yesterday.

It seemed he was the one who dropped Jason off, and Jason looked visibly happy.

I pulled Brett aside and reminded him, "Don't forget what I told you."

He nodded seriously, "Don't worry, Mom. I'll get it done."

His earnest little face was so adorable.

After dropping Brett off, I went back home.

Since someone was following me, wandering around aimlessly would make Brandon suspicious.

At home, Holly immediately brought me some supplements.

She had been instructed by Kathy and knew a bit about my situation. She felt sorry for me and took extra care of my health.

Under her care, I felt like I had gained some weight. Although my body hadn't fully recovered, I felt more energetic.

A few uneventful days passed, and it was time for Brandon to attend the gathering.

As soon as he left, Paula messaged me, telling me who Brandon really took with him.

It was indeed Earl and Francis, but also someone unexpected-Elora.

I couldn't believe she was going too. It seemed Brandon had some other plans.

I messaged Paula, "Why don't you tell your sister about this? She'd be very interested."

Paula quickly replied, "Got it."

It seemed she understood my hint. A few minutes later, she video-called me.

I answered and saw Paula recording Shirley, who seemed oblivious.

"Sis, who are you waiting for? Mr. Jordan, perhaps?"

Shirley had changed a lot since she stopped being a nanny. She used to wear plain clothes, but now she was in high heels and a little camisole, with heavy makeup on.

I didn't say anything, just watched as Shirley glared at Paula. "What's it to you?"

Paula's voice was lazy, "How is it not my business? After all, I've slept with Mr. Jordan too, and I'm his secretary now. I know his whereabouts best."

Sure enough, Shirley got agitated and looked at Paula eagerly. "Where is he?"

"What's it to you?"

Paula shot back with the same words Shirley had used.

"You..."

Shirley looked furious. "I'm telling you, once you find a place, get out of my house. I don't need you here."

"What do you mean your house? This is the place Mr. Jordan rented for both of us. It's neither your house nor mine."

"Stop talking nonsense. Are you going to tell me or not?"

Paula picked up an apple from the table. "Fine, I'll tell you. Mr. Jordan isn't coming back today. He's gone to a gathering with some people."

"And it's a very important gathering, the one you almost messed up."

Shirley's face turned sour, glaring at Paula.

Paula shrugged innocently. "Glaring at me won't help. Mr. Jordan is indeed not here. He's attending a leader's gathering."

"And he took Elora with him. See how capable Elora is?"

"Why is it that as a mistress, your treatment is so poor?"

I had to admire Paula's sharp tongue. She would probably drive Shirley crazy sooner or later.

###chapter 70

Clearly, Shirley was really pissed off. "Shut up!"

Paula chuckled lightly. "Did I hit a nerve? No need to get all worked up. Sure, the money and the house are Elora's, but all the work falls on you. Shows Brandon still needs you."

Shirley glared at Paula. "Shut up! Just shut up!"

I was worried Paula might push too far. What if Shirley decided to hit her?

Paula seemed to read my mind and taunted, "You gonna hit me? Do you dare?"

Shirley, who had been holding a vase, put it down.

"What's so great about Elora? She just had a kid with Mr. Jordan, but I..."

Shirley stopped mid-sentence, and Paula got curious. "What?"

Shirley snapped back. "What's it to you?"

Paula sighed. "I'm just saying, you should have a kid like Elora. That way, you could be with Mr. Jordan forever."

I scoffed. Even I, who had three kids with him, got dumped. What chance does someone with no background have?

"If you have a kid, Mr. Jordan will buy you a big house like Elora's. Didn't you say this place is too small? Just do as I say."

Shirley rolled her eyes. She didn't want to admit it, but Paula had a point.

I sent Paula some photos I had taken earlier-evidence of Elora and another man entering a hotel.

Paula looked at the photos, paused for a moment, then excitedly spoke to Shirley.

"How about this, Shirley? I'll make you a deal.

"I'll give you some information, and you owe me a favor."

"What kind of favor?"

"I haven't decided yet, but these photos are pretty juicy."

Paula looked at Shirley. "Do you want to see them? They're about Elora."

After thinking it over, Shirley finally agreed and nodded.

Paula then handed over the photos I had taken, one by one.

Shirley was furious. "Elora is already spoiled by Brandon, and she's still doing this? Disgusting!"

Shirley's words echoed my own thoughts. I couldn't understand why Elora would do such a thing. Was she just seeking thrills?

This was definitely a way to attack Elora, and I wasn't going to let it go easily.

Paula didn't say anything, just put the photos away. "So, what do you think? Pretty good, right?"

Shirley nodded at the photos. "Where did you get these?"

"I have my ways. How about we work together? I'll give you the photos, and you can do whatever you want with them. But when you get money from Brandon, you give me half."

"I need to start thinking about my future too. If you don't agree, then forget it."

Shirley hesitated, but Paula's position in Brandon's company made it convenient for her to get insider information.

After a long pause, Shirley finally nodded.

"Send me the photos!"

Shirley stared at the photos for a long time. I knew she was fuming inside, but she didn't show it in front of Paula.

Knowing Shirley, she would definitely confront Elora and complain to Brandon. And it had nothing to do with me.

Paula hung up, and I mulled over what Shirley had said. Clearly, there were still secrets between her and Brandon. Otherwise, he wouldn't keep her around.

I texted Paula, "I think Shirley's hiding more. Keep an eye on her for me."

Paula quickly replied, "Got it."

I reminded her, "Delete our chat history and everything I sent you. No one can find out."

Paula sent back an OK emoji.

That night, Brandon called me, drunk, saying it was too late to come home.

I asked, "How did the negotiations go?"

Brandon's voice was slurred, "We'll talk when I get back. I need to sleep now."

The next morning, Earl brought Brandon home.

Probably because of the heavy drinking, Brandon slumped on the couch, complaining of a headache and asking me to rub his head.

I looked at him and asked, "Did it go well?"

Brandon nodded, his voice hoarse, "Yeah."

"Oscar is really pleased with me. I also connected with some overseas distributors. They all think our building materials are the best."

It seemed like it had gone well. Brandon wouldn't be this happy otherwise.

"Really? So we can start supplying overseas?"

Brandon nodded, "And two overseas investors want to partner with us!"

I acted very excited because this meant I could move on to the next step.

"Now we just have to wait for those foreigners to visit our company. If everything checks out, we can start our international business!"

I forced a smile, "Really? That soon?"

"Of course. They probably think other building materials are too expensive, so this is perfect for a partnership."

Brandon was so happy, he kept talking non-stop.

When he finally took a break, I said, "Honey, you must be exhausted. Get some sleep."

He nodded and went to bed.

The next morning, Brandon happily went back to the office to share the news with his team.

I returned to my usual routine, taking care of the kids and occasionally meeting up with Joanna and Kathy.

Until one day, I came home furious. Brandon was watching TV, and Holly was taking care of the kids.

Seeing Brandon, I held back my anger and told Holly, "Holly, take the kids to their room."

Holly understood immediately and took the kids away.

Brandon, still in high spirits from his big deal, looked confused, "Honey, what's wrong? Why are you so mad?"

I sneered at Brandon, "Did you know auditors came to the company today?"

Brandon froze for a moment, then tried to act normal, "So what? That's routine."

"Routine? You call it routine when the company doesn't have a single cent?"

Brandon's face changed, staring at me, "How do you know that?"

"How do I know? Those auditors were sent by Joanna to see if you have the capability to partner with overseas companies. And guess what? You don't!"

"What kind of company doesn't have a single cent?"

###chapter 71

Brandon's face shifted instantly. "So, what now?"

I shot him a cold look. "What now? I should be asking you that. Where did all the company's money go?"

"Didn't you boast about landing those big contracts after taking over? How come there's not a single cent left?"

"And you drained our personal accounts too. What did you do with it? If you can't explain yourself today, pack your stuff and get out of my company, and take those useless people you brought with you!"

My words were sharp, and Brandon's face darkened, but he couldn't argue back.

"Did you transfer all my money and plan to divorce me after I die?"

My words struck a nerve, and Brandon jumped up. "Honey, what are you thinking? I would never do that!"

"Let me be straight with you. I invested all the money in another project, including our personal funds. That's why the accounts are empty. But if this project succeeds, the return could be ten percent. That's why I..."

"Only ten percent?" I scoffed. "Do you know how much we could make if we secure the overseas supply route? We could see returns of fifty percent."

"How can you be so foolish? Always getting distracted by small things and messing up the important ones?"

"And those useless people from your family, like Irene. When someone came to check the accounts, she didn't even give them a decent attitude. Can she still do her job or not? If not, there are plenty of others who can!"

"Honey, she's your aunt..."

"Your aunt, not mine. I don't have such a foolish aunt!" I snapped.

Brandon knew he was in the wrong and didn't dare to argue back, but his eyes were filled with resentment.

"Do you know that when I had lunch with Joanna today, she told me about this? I didn't even want to stay there. If you didn't want to secure this deal, you should have told me in advance. I wouldn't have been so embarrassed!"

Hearing this, Brandon panicked. "I do want it, of course I do. I just didn't expect..."

"You didn't expect Joanna to check the accounts, right?"

"So what do we do now? Can we still..."

"What can we do? I said all the good things I could today, and Joanna reluctantly agreed to give us another chance. She'll come back in a few days."

Brandon's eyes lit up. "Really, honey?"

I nodded begrudgingly. "Do you think I'd lie about this? Within two days, no matter what other projects you're investing in, pay the penalty fees, transfer the money back, including the money from our personal accounts."

"If you can't do that, then don't bother working anymore."

I gave Brandon an ultimatum and then went back to my room without looking at him.

Brandon sat on the couch, conflicted for a long time, before finally taking out his phone to make a call.

I didn't care who he was calling. I just wanted my money back!

But I knew this was only a small part of the money.

The real issue was the shares Brandon took from me and the mortgaged properties.

But I couldn't bring that up now, as it would make Brandon suspicious. I had to take it step by step.

I went back to my room, and suddenly, Travis called me.

I was startled and glanced at the door to make sure no one was around. Then I locked it and went to the bathroom to answer Travis's call.

"Mr. Franklin, why are you calling me out of the blue?"

Travis cleared his throat. "I'm sorry. I know things are risky for you right now, but this is the only time I have. I apologize."

"It's okay, just unexpected. You must have something important to tell me, right?"

"Yes, regarding what you mentioned before, I've found a solution. I'll introduce you to an investor. You can discuss the rest with him."

"An investor?" I hesitated. In my experience, businessmen are all about profit. Would someone really help me with something so thankless?

"Yes, he'll be back in the country in a few days. I'll send you the address. You can meet him then."

"Okay."

Although I had my doubts, I had no other options at the moment.

After hanging up, Travis quickly sent me a message with the address. It was a hotel, indicating that the person didn't have a permanent residence here.

Just then, I heard a knock on the door.

"Honey, why did you lock the door?"

I was startled, quickly deleted the call record, and wet my hands at the sink.

Then, while drying my hands, I opened the door for Brandon, my tone still cold. "What do you want?"

Brandon smiled at me. "Honey, why did you lock the door? I thought something was wrong."

I remained expressionless. "You're overthinking. I just didn't want to see you. Anything else? If not, I'm closing the door."

"Wait, wait!" Brandon reached out and blocked the door.

"Honey, I know I messed up this time. I didn't do it on purpose."

"From now on, I'll discuss everything with you, okay?"

I finally opened the door and looked at him. "Really?"

Brandon nodded pitifully. "Honey, this project was actually recommended by Earl. I agreed without thinking. I've already told Earl to pay the penalty fees, cancel the cooperation, and transfer the money back."

After saying that, he glanced at me nervously. "Honey, please don't be mad."

I sneered. "We'll see how you do."

He squeezed in and said, "Honey, let me give you a back massage!"

He started massaging my shoulders, working up a sweat.

I didn't say anything, and when he was exhausted, he looked at me. "Is this okay, honey?"

I reluctantly nodded. "It's okay. Go to sleep. We'll talk when you transfer the money back."

Brandon nodded and lay down.

I got up to pour a glass of warm water and added some sleeping pills.

When I returned, Brandon was still awake. He looked at my water and asked, "Honey, what's that?"

I replied coldly, "Don't you recognize water?"

He shook his head. "I don't recognize my wife's water."

Then, he grabbed my glass and drank it all.

"So this is what my wife's water tastes like. Sweet. You'll have to get another glass."

I turned away without expression, but a smile tugged at my lips.

I knew Brandon too well. Whenever he made me angry and wanted to make up, he would act like this to make me laugh.

So that glass of water was prepared for him, to make sure he drank it openly.

After confirming he drank it, I messaged Simon: "He drank it. Come over in an hour."

###chapter 72

Brandon was soon out like a light, snoring softly beside me. I lay there, waiting, until I saw two quick flashes outside the window. That was Simon's signal.

I quietly slipped out of bed and grabbed Brandon's phone. To make sure he didn't wake up, I stepped on his leg. Normally, he'd wake up in pain, but this time he was out cold and didn't even flinch.

Satisfied, I headed downstairs, but not before leaving a strand of hair on Brandon's body to ensure everything was just as I left it.

Simon was waiting in his car outside. I handed him Brandon's phone.

"His phone's got two systems. He uses the first one for everyday stuff, but the second one is where he keeps the secrets."

I switched to the second system and showed it to Simon.

"Here, this is where he hides all his secrets."

Simon nodded and started searching through the phone.

"What was the name of that group you mentioned last time?"

"This one, the Car Enthusiasts Club."

Simon opened the group, but all the chat history had been wiped clean.

"He's really cautious. The more cautious he is, the more suspicious it gets."

I nodded, knowing all too well how careful Brandon could be.

"So, what now?"

Simon shook his head. "Don't worry. I'll install a monitoring app on his phone. That way, all the messages from this group will be saved on my end, even if he deletes them."

He opened his laptop and connected it to the phone, working quickly and efficiently. I couldn't even follow what he was doing.

In no time, he was done. He then checked the group members' profiles.

Everyone in the group was cautious, using black images and meaningless numbers as names. The only different one was the group admin, who had a picture of a red spider lily.

I was taken aback. "Is it her?"

Simon looked at me. "What do you mean?"

"I've seen this profile picture before when I checked Brandon's phone. Their conversations were... explicit, so it stuck with me."

I opened the chat with the admin. Thankfully, this time the messages hadn't been deleted.

Simon skimmed through them. "I see. We don't know their relationship yet, but I'll look into it."

I nodded. "Thanks for your help."

Suddenly, I remembered something. "Oh, and one more thing. I found out that Earl has been secretly picking up Elora's son, Jason."

I showed him the photos on my phone. "Do you think Jason might be Earl's son, not Brandon's?"

Simon examined the photos and shook his head. "It's hard to say. I'll need to investigate further."

"Thanks."

I said goodbye to Simon and returned to the bedroom with Brandon's phone. He was still asleep. The hair strand was undisturbed, indicating he hadn't moved.

I put his phone back and finally went to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up to see Brandon fiddling with his phone. I was worried he might notice something, but his expression seemed normal.

When he saw me awake, he quickly turned off the screen and came over to hug me. "Morning, babe."

The thought of him carrying an STD made me feel sick. I pushed him away and went straight to the bathroom without a word.

When I came out, Brandon tried to sweet-talk me, but I wasn't having any of it. He knew the only way to make things right was to return the money.

He left the house early that morning. Surprisingly, no one was following me today. I went about my usual routine, dropping off the kids and then returning home.

That evening, Brandon came home very late. I was already asleep by the time he arrived.

The next morning, he woke up early, looking exhausted. "Babe, the money's been transferred back. You can relax now."

"Really?"

I looked at him skeptically.

He nodded. "Yeah, I messed up big time, and I had to fix it myself."

I finally looked at him. "Let's have breakfast."

After breakfast, I took the kids to school. No one was following me again. Maybe Brandon was letting his guard down.

After dropping off the kids, I went to the bank to check our accounts. Sure enough, the money was back.

I immediately transferred it to my personal account.

That evening, Brandon asked me, "Babe, did you move the money?"

I nodded firmly. "Yes. You've proven to be unreliable. From now on, the money for the kids stays with me. If you need it, you can ask, and I'll decide."

Brandon looked conflicted but said nothing.

A few days later, it was the day of my meeting with Travis. I drove to the café near the hotel he had mentioned and met up with Kathy.

I filled her in on the situation and asked her to wait for me at the café while I went to the hotel.

At the hotel, I knocked on the door. A deep voice answered, "Just a moment."

The voice sounded familiar, but I couldn't place it.

The door opened, and the first thing I saw was a man's chiseled abs. I looked up to see him wrapped in a towel, fresh from the shower.

"Hello."

I looked up and was shocked to see a familiar face.

"Royce Castillo?"

Royce nodded. "Long time no see, Caroline."

Seeing his face brought back memories from high school. Royce had been my class president, and I had a huge crush on him. After a bold confession, we started dating, and my grades improved significantly. Even the teachers didn't mind our relationship.

We became the talk of the class. I thought we'd get married, but after graduation, he disappeared without a word. I even went to his house, but it was empty.

I was heartbroken for years until I met Brandon. He was kind and attentive, and I eventually married him.

###chapter 73

Royce's face had changed so much from what I remembered.

The once youthful and innocent face had matured, with deep-set eyes and an aura of a grown man.

As I looked at Royce, he was also sizing me up.

"You've lost weight."

That simple comment made my heart ache a little.

I forced a smile. "You look a lot more solid."

Royce smiled, not confirming or denying. "Come in. We have things to discuss, don't we?"

I nodded and entered his room.

The room was filled with Royce's scent, and I could smell the fresh scent of his body wash.

Since I needed his help, I couldn't just dive into the main topic. I had to make some small talk. "Travis mentioned you just got back from abroad?"

Royce nodded. "Landed this morning."

"That must have been exhausting."

Is there anything more awkward than asking your first love for help?

I fidgeted with my fingers, unsure of what to say next.

"Should I call Travis to explain everything to you?"

Royce crossed his legs and tilted his head slightly. "Why call him? Didn't he tell you to talk to me?"

I braced myself against Royce's intense gaze and spoke with difficulty. "You should know my situation by now."

Royce was succinct. "More or less."

I cleared my throat. "I want to ask for your help. All my shares are with my husband, Brandon. He tricked me out of them. Travis said you could help me..."

I couldn't continue and waited quietly for Royce's response.

He looked at me for a long time before nodding. "I can buy your shares and sell them back to you at the original price."

I looked up sharply. "Really?"

Royce nodded. "Yes."

But helping me like this wouldn't benefit him at all. The recent betrayals made me suspicious.

Did Royce have another motive?

"You..."

I decided to lay everything out in the open to avoid any surprises later.

"You must want something in return, right? Otherwise, you wouldn't make such a loss. Name your price, so I can be prepared."

Royce chuckled, picked up a cigarette from the coffee table, and then put it down again.

It seemed like a subconscious action, and he suddenly realized I was there.

"I do want something..."

I gritted my teeth. I knew it. A businessman wouldn't make a loss.

"I'm willing to give you all my savings as long as I can get the company back. It's very important to me!"

"I'll give you whatever you ask for."

Royce laughed softly and stood up, looking out the hotel window.

"Don't worry, you can definitely afford it, and it's very easy."

I felt relieved. Although I didn't know what he wanted, at least he wouldn't deceive me.

With the main issue settled, I looked at the cigarette in Royce's hand. "Maybe I should go, so you can smoke?"

Royce didn't respond, and I didn't want to leave without his reply, so I waited silently.

Suddenly, he asked, "Have you been doing poorly these years?"

"Well, my husband's entire family wants to kill me. It's no big deal."

I tried to lighten the mood with a bit of humor.

But Royce didn't laugh, and my smile froze awkwardly on my face.

"Um, I should go. Kathy is waiting for me downstairs. We'll talk again soon."

I grabbed my bag and hurried to the hotel door.

As I turned to close the door, Royce had already lit his cigarette.

His dark lashes fluttered in the light, and his fingers, as delicate as jade, held the cigarette, glowing with a faint red light.

Our eyes met, and he silently blew out a smoke ring.

I quickly closed the door, my heart racing uncontrollably.

Given my current health, a fast heartbeat wasn't good.

I leaned against the elevator wall as I went down.

Kathy had been waiting downstairs for a while, worried because I took so long.

Seeing my pale face, she rushed to support me.

"What happened? How did meeting your first love end up like this?"

I was stunned and didn't have time to explain. "Get me a nitroglycerin pill."

Kathy rummaged through my bag and gave me a pill.

It took a while for me to catch my breath.

Then I remembered what Kathy had said. "You knew it was Royce all along?"

Kathy nodded. "Of course. I was the one who recommended him to Travis."

Seeing my state, she muttered, "If I had known, I wouldn't have suggested him. Why are you so upset?"

I shook my head. "I'm not upset."

"Then what's wrong?"

I was silent for a moment before admitting, "I was a bit nervous, so..."

Before I could finish, Kathy burst out laughing.

"Why are you nervous? Wasn't he the one who left without a word? Now he's back to help you, settling an old score."

I pressed my lips together, not saying anything.

Actually, I felt calm when I saw Royce. The past was long behind me, and I had a family now. I believed he did too.

But when I saw Royce alone by the window, smoking, my heart raced uncontrollably.

It felt like I was back in high school, falling for Royce all over again.

But I didn't dare tell Kathy that. She would definitely laugh at me.

After I calmed down, Kathy and I left the hotel.

On the way back, Kathy suddenly said, "By the way, I heard Kurt has had dinner with Elora twice already."

I was surprised. "So soon?"

How long had it been? They'd already had dinner twice?

Kathy didn't seem surprised, as if it was normal.

"You've been at home too long. This is normal nowadays."

"Kurt's age, he probably hasn't had sex with his wife in a long time. He's afraid of getting diseases if he finds someone else, so he's been holding back. Elora is in her prime, a voluptuous and beautiful woman. Who wouldn't like that? One gives money, the other gives her body. It's a perfect match."

Her calm tone shocked me, making me wonder if I'd been out of touch with society for too long.

"What's Kurt's wife's name again?"

Kathy thought for a moment while driving. "I think her last name is Grace."

"I remember now. Beatrice Grace."

I nodded. "It's time to start our plan."

###chapter 74

Just then, Simon called me out of the blue.

"Hey Simon, what's going on?" I answered.

"Brandon's in trouble. My guys saw him surrounded by a bunch of people from the Jordan family and taken to the hospital," he said.

"The hospital?"

Kathy and I exchanged a worried look. Brandon was in the hospital, and no one had told me.

"Yeah, apparently he just collapsed during a meeting. Earl and Irene took him to the hospital, and Renee and Karen showed up soon after."

Collapsed?

I suddenly remembered researching the symptoms of syphilis when Brandon was diagnosed.

"Could it be stage two syphilis?"

"Very likely. I had bugged his phone earlier. I'll send you the recording in a bit."

Kathy couldn't hold back, "Serves him right. Sleeping around like that, he deserves whatever he gets."

Simon sounded surprised, "Is Kathy with you?"

"Yeah, we were out running some errands together," I replied.

After I told him about reclaiming the company shares, Simon said seriously, "Got it. I have some things to handle here. I'll send you the recording soon."

Not long after hanging up, Simon sent me the recording from Brandon's phone.

The recording started with chaos in the meeting room: "Mr. Jordan, what's wrong?"

Earl's voice came through, "He's got a fever. Get him to the hospital quickly."

There was a lot of shuffling and noise.

I manually skipped ahead, and soon it was inside the hospital.

Brandon seemed to have woken up, lying on the hospital bed, asking, "What happened to me?"

The room was eerily quiet until someone finally responded, "Brandon, you have syphilis. It's already in the second stage. How did you not notice earlier?"

Brandon was stunned and immediately broke down, "No way, no way. I always used protection. How could I still get infected?"

Irene's voice chimed in, "I hate to say it, but your private life is too messy. You can't just sleep around with anyone."

No one spoke after that, only the sound of Brandon throwing things could be heard.

Soon, Renee and Karen arrived. Karen started crying as soon as she saw Brandon lying on the bed.

"Brandon, how could you be so careless?"

Renee's voice was calm but firm, "It's not a big deal. Syphilis won't kill you and it can be treated. As long as you don't get a blood test, it won't be detected."

"The most important thing now is to keep this from Caroline. Get your treatment done quickly while you have the chance."

Renee seemed to have become the backbone of the Jordan family.

Hearing her words, Brandon stopped his tantrum, and Karen stopped crying.

The recording ended there. I looked at Kathy, "They don't want me to know. What if I go to the hospital anyway?"

Kathy couldn't help but grin, "Great idea. Scare the hell out of him."

We decided to act immediately. We drove to the company, pretending we had just learned about Brandon's collapse, and rushed to the hospital.

At the hospital, I headed straight to the emergency room, tears almost streaming down my face, "Where's my husband? What happened to him?"

"Take me to my husband!"

Kathy couldn't help but give me a thumbs up, "Nice performance."

Soon, Earl came out of the hospital lobby, and I grabbed him.

He looked at me, stunned, "Caroline? What are you doing here?"

I was on the verge of tears, "I went to the company, and they said Brandon collapsed. What's going on?"

Earl frowned. If it weren't for my presence, he might have cursed out loud.

"It's nothing serious, just a fever that wasn't taken care of, so he collapsed. He'll be fine after some treatment."

"Caroline, you should go home. Isn't the kid still at home?"

He tried to stop me, but I shook my head, tears streaming down, "I was so scared. Just let me see Brandon for a moment. It'll put my mind at ease."

Earl had no choice but to frown and lead me to Brandon's room.

Seeing me, the Jordan family members glared at Earl, as if asking who brought me here.

Earl sighed, "Caroline went to the company and found out about Brandon collapsing."

I ignored their conversation and pushed open the door to the hospital room.

Brandon was lying on the bed with an IV drip, and the room was a mess, with broken vases and cups everywhere.

Seeing me, Brandon looked like he had seen a ghost, "Honey, what are you doing here?"

I cried as I approached his bed, but I didn't touch him because I was disgusted by his illness.

"Honey, the people at the company said you collapsed. I was so scared. What happened to you?"

Brandon's face was pale. He looked at me for a long time before slowly saying, "I'm fine, just a bit of a fever."

I immediately stood up, "I'll go ask the doctor. How could you have a fever out of nowhere?"

Brandon was visibly frightened and quickly stopped me, "No, honey, it's really just a fever. I'm fine."

To prove it, he even stood up and walked around the bed, smiling at me.

"I've just been working too hard lately, so I got a fever. I'll be fine after a couple of days of rest."

I didn't know when Renee had slipped in, but she suddenly spoke from behind me like a ghost, "That's right, Caroline. Brandon is fine."

I glanced outside. Kathy was chatting idly with Earl and the others.

For some reason, Renee made me uneasy. I always felt something was off about her.

Thinking about what she had done to Asher before made me even more anxious.

"That's good. I was so worried, wondering how he could collapse out of nowhere."

"It's fine. We'll stay here with him. You should go home and take care of the kids. We'll bring him back after his treatment."

Since she said that, I couldn't argue. I continued my act.

"Honey, come home soon. Take a break for a few days. Don't overwork yourself."

Brandon nodded, pulling the blanket up, "Go on, or you'll be late picking up Brett."

After leaving the hospital, I signaled Kathy to follow me.

Outside, Kathy sighed, "I didn't expect their family to be so tight-lipped. I couldn't get anything out of them."

I nodded, not commenting further.

When it came to this, their family always stood united.

After parting ways with Kathy, I went to pick up Brett and headed home.

At that moment, Jason was standing alone at the gate, looking pitiful, probably waiting for his mom to pick him up.

But I only glanced at him. Kathy was right before. If I felt sorry for him, who would feel sorry for my child?

I took Brett home, where Holly had already prepared dinner.

###chapter 75

She saw Brett and me. "When's Mr. Jordan coming back?"

I shook my head and walked over to whisper, "From now on, only use a specific set of dishes and utensils for Brandon. Don't let him touch anything else."

Holly looked surprised but quickly nodded.

After Brett and I finished eating, Holly took him to play.

I got the latest audio file from Simon, probably recorded after I left.

I went to my room and played it. Renee's voice came through: "Think about who could have given you the poison and cut ties with her immediately."

Brandon sounded worn out. "There's no one. I've only been around familiar people lately."

Renee scoffed. "Then one of your familiar people is the problem. See if she's still useful to you, and then get rid of her..."

Her words, though ordinary, sounded eerie and sinister when spoken by Renee, sending a shiver down my spine even in the bathroom.

Simon called me shortly after. "Did you listen to it?"

I nodded. "Renee seems complicated. Even Brandon listens to her."

Simon agreed. "Exactly. I noticed that too."

"Ever since Renee showed up, everyone in the Jordan family has been following her lead. There's definitely more to uncover about her."

I nodded, feeling uneasy about confronting a crazy woman like Renee. She seemed capable of anything.

"By the way, there's something else I need to remind you about. The butler around your mom..."

I nodded. "Go on!"

"He's quite close to Elora. I've seen them having meals together several times, though nothing inappropriate. I suspect they might be related."

Hearing this made my hair stand on end. "Brandon planted Elora's person next to my mom?"

"Yes, but you'll need to check it out yourself for more details. I don't have all the specifics."

I nodded. For Kelly's safety, I had to investigate.

After hanging up, I recalled Elora's face. Since she dared to mess with Kelly, whether willingly or not, she had to be dealt with.

I called Kathy first. "Kathy, it's time to let Beatrice know about Elora. Our plan needs to start."

Kathy understood immediately and got to work.

Next, I called Paula. "Do you remember the photos I sent you of Elora with other men at the hotel?"

Paula responded quickly. "Yeah, I remember. What's up?"

"Use them to provoke Shirley, make her act irrationally. You know how to handle this better than I do."

Paula caught on quickly. "Got it."

Before hanging up, she added, "By the way, Mrs. Jordan, there's something else."

"Today, Brandon sent someone to our apartment to take a blood sample from both Shirley and me."

It seemed they were already searching for the source.

"Don't worry. Brandon has an STD and is looking for the source. It shouldn't concern you two. Just cooperate."

Paula sounded hesitant. "But I..."

"Relax. If something happens, the Jordan family will come for you first, not me."

"But I suggest you get checked at the hospital, just to be safe."

Paula hung up, and I took a deep breath. Everything was set in motion. Now, I just had to wait for things to unfold.

Soon, the first part of my plan took effect.

I woke up to several videos from Kathy, all centered around a confrontation.

In the videos, Beatrice blocked a luxury car at a restaurant entrance, shouting at the person inside.

"You shameless bitch! Who dares to seduce my husband behind my back? Get out here!"

The next video showed Beatrice dragging Elora out of the car and pinning her to the ground.

Beatrice, having lived a life of luxury, had a fuller figure compared to Elora, who maintained her physique to attract men.

Elora couldn't fight back for long and was soon overpowered by Beatrice.

"You bitch! How dare you seduce my husband!"

Elora wailed on the ground, crying for help.

Beatrice, unrelenting, yanked her hair and cursed. "Tell me, when did this start?"

"Confess, or I'll beat you to death."

Elora could only cry out in pain, unable to say anything.

I realized that while Elora wasn't innocent, the other culprit, Kurt, was nowhere to be seen.

I opened the next video and saw that Kurt's luxury car was already gone.

He ran away?

I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity. Kurt really couldn't control himself. Maybe he should just get it cut off.

Kathy called me, her face full of excitement. "Did you see it?"

I nodded. "Did you record the video yourself?"

Kathy shook her head, smiling. "I asked a friend to do it. I told them to capture everything. Wasn't it thrilling?"

I nodded, impressed. "Very professional. Well done."

Kathy grinned. "Keep watching. There's more to come."

Her words piqued my curiosity. I clicked on the next video and saw that Beatrice had stripped Elora's clothes at some point.

She slapped her, pulling her hair. "You seduce my husband, and now you'll be exposed for everyone to see!"

Elora covered her face, looking for a place to hide.

But Beatrice, stronger, quickly pulled her hands away.

"Don't cover your face. Let everyone see you."

Elora was completely exposed online.

Soon, the police arrived and stopped Beatrice.

Elora, covering her face, lay on the ground, not moving for a long time.

Only after a female officer gave her a coat did she slowly get up and get into the police car.

The video ended, and I forwarded it to Simon. "Have you seen this video?"

Simon quickly replied. "No, when did this happen?"

If even Simon, with his extensive network, hadn't seen it, it meant the video was still circulating in a limited circle. I needed to make it go viral!

###chapter 76

I shared my thoughts with Simon, and he got it right away.

"Got it. I'll handle it."

Sure enough, by the end of the afternoon, the video was all over the city.

Even our nanny, Holly, had heard about it.

But it wasn't enough for me. Most people didn't know who Elora was; they just knew she was some mistress who got beat up. That was too easy on her.

I told Simon to keep pushing the video, aiming to get it trending.

Just as I finished talking to Simon, Brandon walked in.

I was surprised but quickly hid my disgust and approached him. "Hey, how are you feeling?"

Brandon shook his head. "I'm okay, just a bit tired."

I made room for him on the couch, even though I was actually repulsed by him. "Then sit down and rest."

"What's wrong with you? You look so weak."

Brandon, of course, didn't dare to tell the truth and could only muster up a response. "Just a bit of a cold, it looks worse than it is."

"Let's sleep in separate rooms tonight. I don't want to risk getting you sick."

I had been thinking the same thing but didn't know how to bring it up. Luckily, Brandon suggested it first.

"By the way, with your health like this, can you still handle the overseas business? Maybe I can help..."

Before I could finish, Brandon firmly refused. "No way. You need to rest more. I'll handle it. I'll get some IV treatments and be fine in a few days."

I nodded. "Thanks for your hard work."

I called Holly. "Please prepare a separate room for my husband. We'll be sleeping apart for the next few days."

Holly nodded and quickly got to work.

I turned to Brandon. "The room is ready. You should go rest."

Brandon nodded and went upstairs.

I pointed to the spot where Brandon had been sitting. "Holly, please disinfect this area."

Holly understood and went to get the cleaning supplies.

I looked at her and said, "We'll need to do this every time. It's a bit more work for you, but I'll give you a raise."

Holly shook her head. "No need, Mrs. Jordan. You already pay me well, and this is part of my job. It's not a problem."

I felt a surge of gratitude towards Holly. How did I get so lucky to find such a great nanny?

When Brandon came back earlier, he didn't seem to know what had happened.

Probably because he spent all day at the hospital yesterday, worrying about his own health, with no time to think about anything else.

Simon was quick to act, and soon enough, the video of Elora was trending, thanks to some paid followers.

Once it was trending, more people started paying attention, and Elora's scandal blew up.

The next morning, when Brandon got up, I was already waiting for him on the couch.

"Did you sleep well last night?"

Brandon nodded wearily. "It was okay."

He still looked pale, but better than yesterday.

I showed him the trending video. "Check this out..."

Brandon was initially uninterested, but his eyes widened when he saw Elora.

"When did this happen?"

"Last night while you were at the hospital. I heard Elora tried to seduce Kurt and got beaten up by Beatrice. Lots of people filmed it."

Brandon stiffened and didn't speak for a long time. I continued, "I heard Elora is someone else's mistress. No wonder she didn't want me to meet her husband. Something's fishy!"

Brandon's eyes flickered with guilt. "There's nothing fishy. Don't jump to conclusions."

I didn't say anything, just kept showing him the video. "Beatrice said Elora's private life is a mess. Who knows if she has any diseases..."

My words seemed to hit a nerve. Brandon stood up, tense. "Honey, I need to go out."

I knew he was going to find Elora, probably suspecting she had given him his illness.

"Where are you going? Aren't you going to eat?"

Brandon grabbed his coat without looking back. "There's something at the office. I'll skip breakfast."

I didn't want to eat with someone who might have a disease anyway.

Holly and I quietly ate breakfast with the kids.

That evening, when I picked up Brett, Brandon still wasn't back.

I didn't care. After putting Brett to bed, I went to sleep.

The next morning, Elora's video was still trending. People love a good mistress-beating scandal.

Elora's attractive figure drew even more attention, blowing the situation out of proportion.

Elora was probably losing her mind, her affair now public knowledge. And who knows how Brandon would deal with her? Would he still trust her?

After dropping Brett off at school, I kept an eye on the trending topics.

Soon, netizens started digging into Elora's past, uncovering everything about her.

The internet is a powerful tool. Elora was exposed both in real life and online.

They even found her elementary school classmates, who quickly distanced themselves from her online.

The juiciest gossip was about who Elora's lover was.

Some speculated that Elora wouldn't settle for an ordinary man, so her lover must be a successful, high-profile individual she had access to.

The most notable part of her resume was her time as a marketing manager at my company.

Former colleagues revealed that Elora had once worked closely with Brandon, and their relationship had become very close.

With this lead, netizens discovered that Elora's son also had the last name Jordan, and she lived in a multi-million dollar mansion next to Brandon's mother's house.

By now, everyone was convinced that Brandon was Elora's lover.

Yet, Brandon hadn't responded to any of this, probably because it was true.

As the victim in this scandal, I received countless concerned calls.

I brushed them off, except for Kathy. When she called, I was excited. "It's finally starting!"

Until now, I had been playing nice with the Jordan family. But now, it was time to face the darkness head-on.

###chapter 77

Kathy was just as excited. "You ready for this?"

I nodded firmly. Today was the first step in tearing down the facade, and it had to be done right. This was crucial for the future.

Kathy asked, "Has Brandon come back yet?"

I shook my head. "I can't wait to hear what kind of lies he'll come up with this time."

After chatting with Kathy for a bit, I heard a car outside. Realizing he was back, I quickly hung up the phone and sat on the couch, pretending to be furious.

When Brandon walked in, he didn't say a word. I spoke first. "Let's get a divorce."

Brandon was stunned. He was betting that I hadn't seen the news online, thinking they could suppress the rumors. Too bad they were a step too late.

"Honey, did you see those lies online?"

I looked at Brandon with disappointment. "I can't believe that after all these years, you would do something so disgusting while I was sick!"

"I trusted you with Elora to help you at the company, and this is how you repay me?"

Brandon shook his head repeatedly. "Honey, those are all lies. They made it up. Elora and I have nothing going on. You have to believe me!"

"How can I believe you? Isn't Elora's child named Jordan? Doesn't she live next to your mom?"

"No wonder your mom always praises the neighbor's kid and treats our Brett like he's nothing. She's been fed up with us and wants a change, right?"

"Fine, I'll make it easy for you. I'll take the kids and leave. You can get out with nothing."

Brandon's face darkened. He couldn't let that happen. He had worked too hard for this. Giving it up would be worse than death.

He knelt in front of me. "Honey, I swear, I never touched Elora. That child isn't mine. You have to believe me."

I was shocked at how easily he could lie.

"Do you think I can still believe you?"

"If you say it's not you, then bring Elora's husband here. I want to see who he is!"

Brandon gritted his teeth and actually made a call.

"Honey, just wait. I'll call him right now!"

I watched as he called someone, telling them to come over. I was curious to see who he would bring.

Who else could fit the bill perfectly?

Earl!

I suddenly realized it. Sure enough, Earl arrived shortly after and quickly explained, "Caroline, I saw the rumors online. Brandon didn't do any of that. It was me."

I smirked. Brandon probably didn't know that Earl was also Elora's lover, so he spoke naturally without any flaws.

"You...?"

I looked at him skeptically. Earl nodded. "Yes, Jason is my child. Elora has been with me, but we never got married. I felt ashamed of having a child out of wedlock, so I didn't say anything."

Earl's words were half-truths, but Brandon didn't know that.

"Honey, you see? It wasn't me. I swear I never touched Elora."

Earl lowered his head, a dark look in his eyes.

With Earl saying this, I had no choice but to relax my tone. "Really?"

Brandon seized the opportunity to pledge his loyalty, kneeling beside me. "Of course, honey. Believe me, I have nothing to do with Elora!"

I wondered what Elora would think if she heard this.

Earl also urged, "Caroline, don't be mad. Brandon really didn't do anything."

With that, I glared at them. "Then why haven't you issued a public statement? Joanna called me earlier, saying if this gets worse, our overseas partners might cancel their contracts."

Neither of them wanted to lose this hard-earned opportunity, so they quickly agreed. "We'll issue a statement right away."

Earl went out to make a call, and soon the company's official Twitter account clarified the rumor.

"The man mentioned in the rumor is Mr. Brandon Jordan's brother, Mr. Earl Jordan, not Mr. Brandon Jordan. We reserve the right to pursue legal action against those who defamed Mr. Brandon Jordan."

The statement quieted things down online. Those who had been attacking us apologized, asking the company not to sue them.

Earl became the official father of Elora's child, Jason. But I suspected Jason really was Elora's child.

I needed Simon to investigate. I found the photos of Earl picking up Jason again.

"Use this opportunity to release these photos. I bet Brandon's suspicious nature won't let him ignore it."

"The Jordan family appears united and invincible on the surface. To take them down, we need to start from within."

Simon quickly understood and sent the photos to the media.

The Jordan family news was a hot topic, and everyone wanted a piece of it.

Simon gave the photos to all the media outlets, and soon it was trending again.

Brandon's expression grew darker as he saw the news.

He noticed the unusual look on Earl's face while holding Jason, something no uncle would have.

This was exactly what I wanted. My goal wasn't to have the public judge Brandon. That would be too messy.

I wanted to drive a wedge between Brandon and Earl, making them fight each other.

This way, I could gradually regain control of the company.

Of course, there were still obstacles like Irene and the mysterious Renee, but it was progress.

With the photos of Earl and Jason out, more pictures of Earl and Elora at a hotel soon followed.

Brandon's face grew darker as he saw the news, and he finally cursed, got up, and drove away.

I watched his car leave, smirking.

Your good days are just beginning.

###chapter 78

In the dead of night, Brandon stormed into the house, kicking the coffee table to pieces.

I pretended to be woken up by the noise and went downstairs, walking over to him.

"Babe, what's got you so worked up?"

Brandon was fuming about the fact that the kid was really Earl's, but he couldn't tell me directly, so he forced a smile. "Just some work stuff, really frustrating."

I sneered inwardly but kept a concerned look on my face. "Is it because of all the public backlash? Actually, I have an idea."

He nodded. "Let's hear it."

"Because of Elora, all of Earl's past actions have been dug up. His fights, paying for school, all of it is hurting the company's reputation."

"Why don't we hold a press conference to distance the company from Earl and Elora? This way, the public might focus on them instead."

I hesitated a bit. "It might be a bit underhanded, but it's better than the current mess, right?"

Brandon's eyes showed a cold glint as he thought it over. He had never agreed to use family as a shield before, but this time, it was Earl who had caused the trouble. So, Brandon nodded, a ruthless look in his eyes. "Alright, let's do it."

I smiled slightly. The rift between them was now irreparable.

We acted quickly. Brandon sent Earl to another city, and during that time, we held the press conference.

At the conference, Brandon portrayed Earl and Elora's relationship as a personal matter, completely unrelated to the company. He also announced that Earl would be demoted internally because of this issue.

When it was my turn, I recounted my experiences with Elora over the years, adding some embellishments about how she betrayed the company, making it clear we were cutting ties with her.

The cameras flashed incessantly, but I didn't blink, maintaining my smile.

It wasn't until I stepped off the stage that I finally breathed a sigh of relief.

I used to face such situations without any fear, but now, for some reason, I felt a bit nervous.

As soon as I reached the backstage area to rest, I saw Earl storming into Brandon's room, shouting.

"You sent me away just to do this? What the hell are you thinking?"

Brandon stood up, looking at him coldly. "You know what you did. But because you're my brother, I won't actually punish you. It's just for show. You should be grateful."

Earl scoffed. "Screw you."

Brandon's eyes blazed with anger. "Say that again, I dare you."

Earl retorted defiantly. "What if I do? Do you have the guts to tell Caroline what you did?"

"You slept with Elora too, didn't you? Stop pretending to be a saint."

Brandon slammed the table. "Shut up!"

I stood by the door, listening, a cold smile on my lips.

"Everyone knows I treated Elora as my future wife, even raised her child as my own. But the child turned out to be yours?"

Just then, someone tapped my shoulder. "Mrs. Jordan..."

I jumped and turned around, seeing a clean-cut young man standing behind me.

"Who are you?"

The man replied politely, "Hi, Mrs. Jordan. I'm Francis, Earl's personal assistant."

Before I could respond, he added, "I was also placed here by Mr. Lawson."

I relaxed and nodded.

He smiled at me, then knocked on the door of the room.

The argument inside stopped immediately, showing they hadn't lost their minds completely.

"Who is it?"

"It's Francis."

I quickly moved aside, pretending I had just arrived.

The door opened, and Francis walked in, with me following behind.

Seeing me, they didn't continue their previous argument, but the tension in the air was palpable.

Earl's face was grim. "Caroline, was this press conference your idea?"

I nodded calmly, sitting on the couch. "What's the problem?"

"It's not about whether there's a problem, Caroline. Don't you think what you did was wrong? How am I supposed to face the company now? And what about Jason?"

Mentioning Jason made Brandon's face even darker.

I sneered. "What should we do? Because of that troublemaker Elora, the public is attacking you too, saying two people can't share a bed without something happening. They've even dug up your past fights in school. Should we just watch the company collapse without doing anything?"

Earl gritted his teeth. "Those people don't matter. Who cares what they think? It'll blow over in a few days."

I rolled my eyes. "People who paid their way through school have such shallow views. With the current public opinion, they'll dig up everything about you. Don't you care because it's not your company?"

"You..."

Earl looked insulted. "What are you glaring at? Did I say anything about your education? Don't forget who paid for your schooling. Without our family's help, you wouldn't have even graduated."

"Caroline, you don't understand the company matters. Why are you meddling?"

"Meddling?" I pointed at myself, laughing in anger. "Ask Brandon. Without me, could you guys have secured the overseas sales channels?"

At that moment, the door to the room opened. "Caroline, that's a bit harsh. Aren't we family?"

Renee walked in, her tone sinister.

Since I had already said so much, I didn't mind being even harsher. "Isn't it true?"

"If it weren't for me, what would the Jordan family be doing now? You all know better than I do."

"The company is full of your family members, and orders have dropped significantly. Don't you know that?"

After my words, Earl fell silent, knowing I was right.

Renee, not involved in the company, showed no guilt, her eyes turning cold.

"And just because I don't say anything doesn't mean I don't know. Brandon and Elora went to a hotel together. I just thought men make mistakes and forgave him this once."

"If I catch you again, you're all out! Let's see what you are without the company."

I snorted, turned, and left, not caring how they looked at me.

###chapter 79

When I stepped outside, the tension in the air was thick, and I didn't notice someone following me.

I turned around to see Francis trailing behind. "Mr. Lawson's waiting for you outside," he said.

I nodded, and Francis quickly walked away. As the Earl's assistant, it wouldn't look good for him to be seen with me.

I left the venue and saw Simon's car discreetly parked in the shadows. I got in, and Simon immediately started the engine. We couldn't afford to be seen by the company people around here.

Once we reached a quiet spot, Simon turned to me. "I just saw your press conference. Elora's no longer trusted by the Jordan family. Now's the perfect time to get rid of the person close to your mom."

I nodded, having already considered this. "But I don't know what excuse to use."

"You mentioned in the lounge that Brandon and Elora were involved. Use that as your reason. Say you need to go back to your mom's place."

"What about the kids?"

Simon replied, "I've already thought of that. The kids are in another car. Someone will drive you all to your mom's place tonight, catching Brandon off guard."

I was impressed by Simon's foresight. He had planned everything, and with Brett on vacation, it was convenient to take the kids back.

I thanked him, and the car drove me to a secluded lakeside where an SUV was waiting. I got in, and Holly was in the back with the kids, while Brett sat in the second row, excited to see me.

"Mom, someone told me we're going to Grandma's house. Is that true?"

I nodded, ruffling Brett's hair. "Yep, we're spending the holiday at Grandma's."

I rolled down the window and saw Simon's car across from us. He flashed his hazards twice, signaling goodbye, and then drove off hurriedly.

I took a deep breath, knowing we had to leave quickly. This might be our only chance.

I told the driver, "Let's go."

He drove us to the airport, where I bought tickets for a flight a few hours later. We spent the night at the airport.

By the time we arrived in Suncrest City, it was noon. Unlike the city I lived in, Suncrest City was still developing, with a charming, old-world feel. The streets were paved with ancient stones, so cars weren't allowed. We had to walk.

My family's house was deep in the old street. Since my dad passed away, Kelly had lived there alone, saying she was used to the old neighbors.

Urban renewal was coming, and the bustling scenes of my childhood were fading away.

Holly and I carried the kids, while Brett held my hand, bouncing with excitement. He had only been here as a child, and after I got sick, he hadn't returned.

"Mom, Grandma's house is so pretty," Brett said, looking around excitedly.

I smiled. "Wait until you see inside. It's even prettier."

We reached the house, and the door was open. Kelly was sitting at a stone table in the yard, reading a newspaper with her glasses on. The sight brought tears to my eyes.

"Mom..." I called out.

Kelly looked up, dazed, as if she couldn't believe her eyes. "Caroline?"

I nodded, smiling through my tears. Kelly rushed over and hugged me tightly. "Caroline, I thought I was dreaming. You're really back?"

I nodded, not mentioning Brandon. "Yeah, the kids are on break, and I'm feeling better, so I came back."

Kelly took Brett's hand, and we all went inside. Eugene came out, looking surprised to see me.

I smiled. "Eugene, right? Could you help us with the luggage?"

Eugene nodded and took our things inside.

My room was just as it had been before I got married. My mom hadn't changed a thing, making it feel like I was back in my carefree youth.

Eugene brought in the luggage and said, "Even though you weren't here, Mrs. Sharp had me clean the room regularly."

Holly came in with the kids, and I said, "Eugene, could you arrange a room for them too? Holly will be taking care of my kids."

Eugene nodded, took the baby from me, and led Holly out.

Left alone with my mom, I had so much to say but didn't know where to start. Kelly's hair had streaks of white, and seeing them made it even harder to speak.

"Caroline, tell me the truth. Why did you come back so suddenly? Did you have a fight with Brandon?"

I shook my head. "Don't worry, Mom. No, I just missed you. And the kids hadn't been here, so I decided to come."

Kelly looked at me. "Then why didn't Brandon come?"

"He's busy with work. I'll have him call you later."

Kelly didn't press further. I didn't want to burden her with the ugly details of my life, so I lied.

After settling in, Eugene started preparing lunch. Holly wanted to help, but I stopped her.

"Holly, you didn't sleep much last night, taking care of the kids. You should rest. I'll call you when lunch is ready."

Holly hesitated. "What about the kids?"

I pointed to Kelly, who was happily playing with them. "My mom can handle three kids on her own. You can relax here."

With my encouragement, Holly reluctantly went to rest.

Soon, Brandon called. "Honey, where are you?"

I didn't know if Eugene had told him or if he had just come home to find me gone.

"I'm at my mom's."

"Why didn't you tell me?" Brandon sounded annoyed.

I laughed coldly. "You don't know why I left? I haven't even confronted you about Elora, and you're already questioning me?"

"Just because I'm not making a fuss doesn't mean I'm not angry."

Brandon fell silent, guilt evident in his voice.

###chapter 80

"When are you coming back, hon?"

"Don't worry about me. I'll be back once I've cooled off. Just make sure you handle the overseas stuff right, okay?"

"If anything comes up, call me first. No more making decisions on your own like before."

Brandon, feeling guilty, agreed to everything I said without hesitation.

Just then, Kelly asked who was on the phone. I showed her the screen. "It's Brandon. He noticed I hadn't called since I landed and wanted to check in."

Brandon heard this and I put him on speaker: "Talk to Mom."

He didn't dare mention why I was coming home, so he made small talk with Kelly. "Mom, how have you been?"

"I'm really busy right now. Just opened up the overseas market. I wanted to go with you, but I just don't have the time."

Kelly smiled. "It's okay. It's the thought that counts. Come see me next time."

"Alright, Mom. I have to go now. I'll call you later."

With that, Brandon hung up.

I looked at Kelly. "See? We're fine."

Kelly nodded, then suddenly looked outside. "Caroline, come in here. I need to talk to you."

We put the kids in the room, and she said, "Actually, I didn't explain the urban renewal thing clearly last time. Your dad didn't just buy one house here."

I was stunned and quickly asked, "What do you mean?"

Kelly continued, "Your dad always believed that Suncrest City, with its rich cultural heritage, would eventually be heavily developed for tourism. So, he bought several plots of land early on, including the hill behind our house. All of it is within the urban renewal area."

I was in disbelief. I couldn't even imagine the cost of one house, let alone all the land my dad had the foresight to buy.

Kelly added, "Don't tell anyone about this. I only mentioned the house last time because I was afraid. People can turn into beasts over money. I didn't want to gamble on what he might become."

I wanted to laugh coldly. Brandon was already a beast; money wouldn't change that.

I thought of my dad's smiling face and shook my head. "Dad had such great foresight. Who could have predicted this back then?"

My mom smiled too, her eyes filled with nostalgia. "Yes, he just wanted to make sure you had enough money so you wouldn't suffer."

"He always told me that daughters should be raised in wealth and should live in wealth their whole lives."

Kelly's words brought tears to my eyes. "I'll take the kids to see him in a few days."

Kelly nodded, wiping away a tear. "Go ahead. Your dad misses you too."

I couldn't look Kelly in the eye, afraid we'd both start crying.

So, I changed the subject. "Brett is messing with your plant!"

Kelly jumped up and ran over, not looking like someone nearing seventy.

"Brett, don't touch that!"

I laughed and said to Brett, "Brett, Grandma cares more about that plant than you."

Brett pouted. "No way!"

Kelly coaxed him. "Be a good boy and put it down, okay?"

Watching them bicker, I couldn't help but smile.

I probably smiled more today than I had in a month at home.

Eugene soon had dinner ready. I woke Holly up, and we all ate together.

After we sat down, Eugene stood by Kelly.

I invited him to join us, but he waved it off. "No, in case Mrs. Sharp needs anything, I can help right away."

Kelly looked at him. "Eugene, no need. My kids are here, and I'm happy. I don't need your help."

I agreed. "Yes, Eugene, sit down. I can help Kelly with whatever she needs."

Eugene finally sat down, eating in the corner.

I savored the familiar taste of home.

At home, I usually followed Brandon's heavy taste, but I preferred lighter flavors. Though I'd gotten used to it over the years, I still loved the taste of home.

I was incredibly satisfied with the meal. Afterward, I told Kelly I wanted to go for a walk.

Since college, I hadn't strolled around the neighborhood. I was eager to revisit old memories.

Kelly agreed and handed me a jacket.

I stepped out, feeling rare freedom.

No one was watching me here. I didn't have to worry about the food. Most importantly, I was with Kelly.

There was a long night market in front of the old street. I walked over, wanting to join the fun, and saw some shoes for kids at a stall. I bought three pairs for my kids.

Just then, I heard a familiar voice. "Buying for your kids?"

Startled, I turned and saw Royce standing next to me, looking at me.

I was surprised. "When did you get here?"

He chuckled, his eyes deep. "Just when you entered the night market."

I shook my head. "I meant, when did you come back to Suncrest City?"

"Just a few days ago. I finished my business and wanted to come back. Didn't expect to run into you."

What a coincidence.

I was amazed. "Alright, you go ahead. I'm going to check out that side."

I walked forward, but Royce followed. I thought I was mistaken and walked a few more steps, but he was still right behind me.

"Why are you following me?"

I turned to him.

Royce looked at me. "It's been a while. Can't we walk together?"

For some reason, I saw a hint of sadness in his eyes.

He asked again, "Can't we?"

I reluctantly nodded. "Okay."

Royce immediately walked beside me.

The night market on the old street had a unique charm, with each stall exuding an antique vibe.

I walked around, curiously looking at everything.

There were many snacks I hadn't had in a long time, so I eagerly bought a few to try.

After a few bites, I realized I had already eaten dinner. I was at a loss, looking at the food in my hands.

Maybe I could take it home for the kids as a late-night snack?

But they'd probably be asleep soon, and the food wouldn't be good tomorrow.

Just then, a pair of hands reached out and took the food from me.

"Perfect, I haven't eaten."

Relieved that I wouldn't waste food, I handed it to him. "You can have it all."

He started eating, and I suddenly remembered. "Wait, I used that skewer."

Royce just smiled. "No worries. I don't mind."

I watched him eat, feeling a strange mix of emotions. It was nice to have someone to share this moment with, even if it was unexpected.

We continued walking through the market, chatting about old times and catching up on each other's lives. The night was filled with laughter and nostalgia, and for the first time in a long while, I felt truly at ease.

As we reached the end of the market, Royce turned to me. "It was really good seeing you again. Let's not wait so long next time."

I nodded, smiling. "Yeah, let's not."

We said our goodbyes, and I headed back to Kelly's, my heart lighter than it had been in a long time.

###chapter 81

Royce blinked at me, using the same skewer I had used. "It's cool, I don't mind."

I was speechless.

I followed Royce from one end of the street to the other, and he finished all the food.

Watching him, I couldn't help but chuckle. I had bought quite a lot, and he seemed to struggle with it.

Ahead was an area where street vendors weren't allowed, but there were still plenty of people out for an evening stroll, so it was brightly lit.

Royce and I walked side by side in silence, each lost in our own thoughts.

He suddenly spoke up, "Don't you have anything you want to ask me?"

I nodded. Royce raised his chin, signaling me to go ahead.

I asked, "How did you make so much money?"

A few days ago, I had heard about Royce's recent experiences from Kathy, and I was utterly shocked.

Royce had always been a good student, but his family was quite ordinary, with both parents being teachers.

So when he suddenly disappeared, I couldn't accept it, but I thought maybe he got into a good college, and his parents didn't allow him to contact me, or he didn't want to.

But who would have thought he would turn into a famous investor?

He had invested in many startups that went public, and his personal wealth had grown significantly.

Royce choked, "That's what you want to ask me?"

I nodded. After my divorce from Brandon, I needed to start over, and running a company would require my attention. Learning from someone successful like him seemed like a good idea.

Royce's face darkened, and he didn't say anything. Somehow, I felt like he was a bit angry.

I knew what Royce wanted me to ask, but I didn't want to. I didn't know where this inexplicable emotion came from.

After a while, Royce spoke first, "Back then..."

I waved my hand, "You don't have to say it. It's your privacy."

Royce choked again, then smiled helplessly, "You really know how to get under someone's skin, you know that?"

"Whether you want to hear it or not, I'm going to say it."

"Back then, something happened to my family. My parents died in a car accident, and I became an orphan overnight."

I held my breath, looking at him in disbelief.

"I didn't tell you because I thought I might never recover, and I wasn't suitable for you at the time. You got into a good college, and your family was well-off, so your future was bound to be bright."

"But at that time, I was in a state of despair about my life..."

He spoke calmly about the past, but it sounded so sad to me.

I didn't know what to say, so I just looked at him.

"Later, I went abroad to find my uncle and stayed with him, doing business. That's my story."

I nodded, feeling a mix of emotions. "You should have told me back then."

Royce was silent for a moment, then said hoarsely, "I know, I realized later that I was wrong."

Suddenly, fireworks exploded behind us, startling me. I turned around to look.

Royce also turned slowly, the brilliant fireworks standing out against the night sky.

I sighed, "It's beautiful!"

Royce echoed, "It really is."

When the fireworks ended, I looked at Royce and found he was already looking at me.

"I have to head back now. Bye."

Royce nodded, standing still.

I walked a long way before turning back. I saw Royce still standing there, waving at me.

I felt a strange emotion but chose to ignore it and went home.

Kelly and the three kids were already asleep, all on one bed. Kelly had only a tiny space, but she was smiling in her sleep.

I covered them with a blanket and went to my room.

Holly brought me a glass of water. "Mrs. Jordan seems really happy."

I nodded, "Who wouldn't be happy to be home?"

After drinking the water, I told Holly, "Go to bed early. Tomorrow, come with me to the mountains. I want to visit my dad."

Holly nodded, and we went to our rooms.

The next morning, Kelly was already up making breakfast.

I was a bit exasperated, "Mom, why are you up so early?"

Kelly smiled, "You like my breakfast, so I got up to make it for you."

I jumped up and kissed Kelly on the cheek. Brett suddenly appeared, looking at me. "Mom, that's embarrassing."

I grinned, "To be honest, Grandma loves me the most, not you."

Kelly laughed and playfully hit me, while Brett pouted, tears welling up in his eyes.

"No, Grandma loves me the most."

Kelly quickly comforted him, "No, no, I love you the most."

After finally calming Brett down, I teased again, "Grandma loves me the most, you're second."

He started crying again.

Kelly glared at me, "Are you a child? Go away!"

I laughed and ran off, feeling like a kid again with Kelly.

I happily waited for breakfast, but then Eugene walked in, his eyes scanning between Kelly and me.

My smile faded. I had been so happy that I almost forgot I was still under someone's watch.

I grabbed an apple and thought about how to get rid of this person.

After breakfast, Kelly held Brett while we ate.

I looked at her doting manner and felt a bit dissatisfied. "Mom, let Brett eat by himself. You'll spoil him."

To my surprise, Brett looked at me smugly. "Grandma likes spoiling me! Mom, you're just jealous."

Kelly laughed, "Serves you right for teasing us. Brett got you back."

I snorted, quickly finished my meal, and prepared some things to visit Gerald. I had Holly carry one child while I carried another, and we held Brett's hand as we headed up the mountain.

Brett walked beside me, curiously asking, "Mom, where are we going?"

I patted his little head, "To see someone Grandma truly loves."

This time, Brett seemed to understand and didn't cry. He obediently followed me up the mountain.

Halfway up, I turned, and a tombstone appeared before us.

"Dad, I'm here to see you."

Brett blinked his little eyes, "Mom, is this Grandpa?"

I nodded, "Call him Grandpa."

"What's Grandpa doing in there?"

I smiled, "Grandpa is resting. He's been tired for a long time."

Brett nodded, somewhat understanding, and touched the tombstone. "Grandpa, you've worked hard."

Tears welled up in my eyes, and I struggled not to cry.

"Brett, go with Holly for a bit. I need to talk to Grandpa."

After Brett left, I knelt down.

"Dad, I'm sorry I'm late."

###chapter 82

The wind gently rustled the nearby tree, almost like Gerald was saying hello.

Through my tears, I said, "Dad, I really wish I'd listened to you back then. I totally misjudged Brandon; he's a terrible person."

"He drugged me and tried to steal the company. Luckily, I found out in time, or I might not be here visiting you today."

All the emotions I had been holding back came pouring out. "If only I had listened to you."

A sudden gust of wind blew through, making the leaves rustle loudly, as if Gerald was saying he heard me. He must be worried sick up there.

I wiped my tears. "But don't worry, Dad. I've grown up. I can handle these things on my own now."

"Even though my marriage didn't work out, I have three wonderful kids. I brought them all here today. My biggest regret is that you never got to meet them."

I motioned for Holly to bring the kids over, and Brett followed.

I patted Brett on the shoulder. "Say hello, Brett."

Brett looked nervously at the gravestone, his fingers clenched, his eyes full of unease. In a soft voice, he said, "Hi, Grandpa. I'm Brett. These are my brother and sister, Yves and Aria."

I was puzzled. "Brett, speak up. Grandpa can't hear you."

To my surprise, Brett looked at me seriously. "Mom, isn't Grandpa resting? I don't want to disturb him."

His innocent words made me smile despite myself.

I held his hand and said earnestly, "It's okay, Brett. Grandpa likes hearing you talk."

Only then did Brett raise his voice and greet his grandpa loudly.

"Grandpa, when can you come take me to school? I love Grandma so much, and I'm sure I'd love you too. If you could take me to school, I'd be so happy."

I stood by, listening quietly, my heart melting.

It was then that I realized I had never lacked love in my life. Gerald and Kelly had loved me wholeheartedly, and now I had three wonderful children. I just hadn't noticed it before.

Suddenly, I felt a surge of courage.

After saying goodbye to Gerald, I prepared to take the kids down the hill. But Brett suddenly ran back to Gerald's gravestone and said, "Grandpa, you rest well here. I'll take care of Mom."

I was deeply moved. My little Brett understood everything, even at his young age.

Back home, I felt more determined than ever. Just then, Joanna called.

While I was away, Brandon had been pushing the overseas business aggressively and had started working with Joanna.

"The plan can start now. Brandon is completely blinded by his own success."

I was immensely grateful. "Thank you, Ms. Thorne. I don't know what I would have done without you."

Joanna chuckled. "No need to thank me. You know my history. I despise people like him. Besides, you're quite interesting. I'm happy to help. But you won't forgive Brandon in the end, will you?"

"Don't worry, I won't."

After hanging up, I saw Eugene sweeping the yard. I pretended to continue my phone conversation. "Yes, our overseas business depends on you. Thank you, Ms. Thorne."

I pretended to hang up and turned to Eugene. "Eugene, I've been staying here for a couple of days and forgot to ask, where are you from?"

Eugene replied softly, "I'm from a village near Suncrest City. I let others farm my land and came out to work since I had nothing else to do."

"Luckily, Mr. Jordan gave me a job."

I scrutinized him. "Don't you have any kids? Don't they miss you when you're away for so long?"

Eugene smiled awkwardly. "My wife passed away early, so we didn't have any kids."

"Any other relatives?"

Eugene shook his head. "None at all."

I frowned, wondering who Eugene really was to Elora, for Brandon to trust him so much.

Eugene finished sweeping and went elsewhere.

I went to my room and found Kelly and Brett watching the kids on the bed.

I closed the door. "Mom, I haven't had a chance to ask you about Eugene."

Kelly shook her head slightly, signaling me to look outside.

Sure enough, there was a shadowy figure standing by the door, seemingly eavesdropping.

I was startled but stayed silent.

Eugene seemed unaware that he had been discovered and continued listening.

I cleared my throat. "Mom, Eugene is so pitiful. How much do you pay him? Make sure to give him enough so he has something to rely on in his old age."

Kelly nodded. "I know. Brandon usually pays him, but I give him bonuses occasionally."

Just then, Holly's voice came from outside. "Eugene, can you help me? I don't know how to use this kitchen appliance."

Eugene hesitated for a moment before walking over to help.

Once he was gone, I let out a sigh of relief. "That scared me."

I looked at Kelly. "Mom, did you know he's been watching you?"

Kelly nodded. "Brandon is probably interested in the urban renewal project here. That's why I kept it a secret."

"You and Brandon are married, but it's natural to have your own thoughts. As long as he treats you well, I can overlook these little things."

I was silent, feeling an urge to tell Kelly everything.

But I couldn't. I had grown up. I had to handle this myself.

I chose to marry Brandon, so I had to deal with it.

"I want to get rid of him. Do you think that's okay?"

I whispered. "He might not harm you, but I'm worried about you being alone..."

Kelly nodded. "Do as you see fit. I'll follow your lead."

Knowing Kelly was cautious, I felt relieved.

Brandon thought he could control Kelly with just anyone. How laughable.

Kelly was one of the first college graduates and had taught for years. She could see right through his schemes.

I opened the door, and Eugene was about to come over. Seeing me, he quickly turned and walked away.

I smirked and stepped outside.

Soon, Holly called us for dinner.

Just as we were about to start, there was a knock on the door.

Kelly and I exchanged glances, and she signaled Eugene to answer it.

"Mrs. Sharp, Caroline, I came to see you."

I was surprised to see Eugene leading Royce in, carrying a bunch of things.

###chapter 83

Kelly didn't seem to think anything was wrong; instead, she smiled.

"Royce, you're here?"

I looked at Kelly, puzzled. She didn't seem like she was meeting Royce for the first time. When did they know each other? How come I didn't know?

"Mom, you know him?"

Kelly smiled at me. "Why wouldn't I? Didn't you date him back in high school?"

I almost choked on my own saliva. That was ancient history, and Kelly was being way too blunt.

"Mom, what are you talking about?"

Looking at Royce, he seemed just as surprised by Kelly's words and stood there, frozen.

Kelly waved him over. "Royce, come on in. What happened between you and Caroline is in the past. You were both young then, so what's the big deal?"

Hearing Kelly say that, Royce finally changed his shoes and slowly walked in.

"Mrs. Sharp, I haven't been back in a while. I thought I'd come by and see how you're doing."

Royce sat next to Kelly, exuding a calm and steady demeanor that elders particularly liked.

Kelly patted his shoulder with a smile. "It's the thought that counts."

They chatted warmly, leaving me feeling a bit awkward, so I focused on eating my meal.

Just then, Brett, who was sitting next to me, looked at Royce with wide, curious eyes and scooted closer to him.

"Who are you?"

Royce, dressed in a long coat, tall and broad-shouldered, was quite striking even just sitting there.

Royce smiled gently at Brett. "I'm a friend of your mom's and a junior to your grandma."

Brett blinked his curious little eyes at him, seemingly trying to figure something out.

I cleared my throat and said, "Brett, come over here!"

"That's not polite."

Royce suddenly laughed. "It's okay. I like Brett."

With that, he took out a gift from the pile he brought. "This is for you and your siblings."

I saw it was a huge, intricately made toy gun that looked quite expensive.

Brett's eyes widened in shock as he stared at the gun.

Kelly laughed. "Royce, you didn't have to bring anything. Brett is at that age where he breaks toys within days."

Royce smiled, unfazed. "It's fine. If he breaks it, I'll get him another one."

I never noticed Royce smiling so much before. Back in high school, I was the one who pursued him.

The reason was simple: Royce was handsome, smart, and most importantly, kept his distance from all the girls.

I had a smooth-sailing life for over a decade and had never experienced rejection, so I became interested in Royce and was determined to win him over.

I chased him around campus for half a year, and he barely smiled at me.

Eventually, I got tired and thought about giving up.

But then Royce showed up, telling me not to give up halfway and to see things through to the end.

He said we couldn't be together then because it would interfere with our studies, but we could talk about it after graduation. He wouldn't reject me.

I didn't pay much attention to what he said at the time and just pulled his tie and kissed him.

Royce's words got stuck in his throat, and his clean face turned as red as the sunset behind him.

After that, we were together until graduation. Then he disappeared, and I moved to another city for college.

Thinking back, it was kind of funny, but not entirely bad.

I suddenly made eye contact with Royce, wondering if he was thinking about the past too. That look made me feel uneasy.

So I cleared my throat. "Brett, did you thank Mr. Castillo?"

Brett, holding the gun, quickly said thank you. "Mr. Castillo, I have a gift for you too."

Royce rested his hands on his knees, looking expectant. "What is it?"

Brett ran over to me and pointed. "Mom is my most precious person. I'm giving her to you as a gift."

Royce was taken aback, then turned and laughed.

I felt both annoyed and amused.

Annoyed that Brett would give me away for a toy gun, but amused that he thought I was the most important person to him.

But not more important than a gun.

I pretended to be angry and asked, "Brett, if I fell into the water with this gun, who would you save?"

Everyone's eyes were on Brett, waiting for his answer.

I looked at Brett, feeling a bit hopeful.

He scrunched up his little face in thought for a long time and said, "That's hard."

Kelly was amused, and the atmosphere at the table was warm and happy.

After thinking for a while, Brett said, "I would save the gun."

I wasn't disappointed, just curious. After all, kids change their minds a thousand times a day.

"Why?"

Brett pointed at Royce. "Because I think Mr. Castillo would save you, so I can save the gun!"

I was stunned and unintentionally made eye contact with Royce.

I quickly looked away and said sternly, "What are you talking about? I can get out of the water myself. I'm a superhero, you know?"

Brett pouted and said, "Okay."

I glanced at Eugene, who had just gone to get water for Kelly, thinking it was a good thing he didn't hear anything. Otherwise, I wouldn't know how to explain it to Brandon.

With the new toy, Brett didn't even want to eat and ran outside to play with it.

It was Independence Day, and many kids had returned home. Before long, Brett became the leader, running around with a group of kids outside.

Inside, we quietly continued our meal.

Kelly suddenly asked, "Royce, how long are you staying this time?"

Royce shook his head. "I'm not sure. Probably until I finish my business here."

"Where's your uncle now?"

Royce answered honestly, "He's still abroad. He plans to work a bit longer before coming back to retire."

"You should try to persuade him. He's not young anymore, almost sixty, right?"

Royce nodded. "I've tried, but he doesn't listen to me."

The familiarity between my mom and Royce made me feel like they had met more than once.

Seeing the look in my eyes, Royce said, "You've rarely come back over the years. I visit Mrs. Sharp every year."

I was surprised. Every year?

But I had never heard anything about him all these years.

Kelly sighed. "Since you got married, the house has been so empty during the holidays. It's a good thing we have someone like Royce visiting."

###chapter 84

I looked at Royce, completely baffled.

He and Kelly weren't that close before, so why was he suddenly visiting her?

I was confused and decided to ask him about it next time.

After finishing his meal, Royce stayed with Kelly for a while longer.

Standing behind the couch, I discreetly signaled to Royce, indicating that I wanted to talk to him alone outside.

Royce got up and followed me to the yard. "What's up?"

"Do you visit Kelly every year? Why?"

Royce tilted his head. "Don't use that tone. I just wanted to check on her..."

His words made me frown slightly. I couldn't understand what was so interesting about an old stranger.

I looked into his eyes with a hint of suspicion. "Did you know about the urban renewal plans for the old neighborhood and decided to get close to Kelly in advance?"

After everything I'd been through, I couldn't help but suspect the worst in people.

I stared at Royce and suddenly noticed a flicker of hurt in his eyes, which I hadn't expected.

He stared at me for a long moment, then abruptly turned to leave.

I was taken aback and instinctively grabbed his hand. "Where are you going?"

Royce turned back, looking at our intertwined hands. I realized my mistake and quickly let go.

His eyes, dark and brooding, fixed on me without a word.

Feeling guilty under his gaze, I slowly lowered my head.

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to doubt you, but you know how paranoid I've become. I couldn't help but think that way."

I apologized to Royce.

He suddenly sighed. "When I came back to the country, I tried to find you, but I didn't know where you were or which university you attended. So, I came to your house."

"But Mrs. Sharp said you were married and very happy."

I didn't say anything, nervously fidgeting with my fingers, unsure of what to say.

"So, I came every year during the holidays, hoping to see you, to see how happy you really were."

I never expected such an answer, which made my previous dark suspicions seem so petty.

"I'm sorry."

Royce sighed. "You don't need to apologize. It's not your fault."

"Excuse me, I should go."

Royce went inside, grabbed his coat, and said goodbye to Kelly before leaving without looking back.

Just as he stepped over the threshold of the yard, he paused for a moment but didn't turn around.

I sighed softly, feeling a mix of emotions.

The moon was exceptionally full tonight, bathing the entire yard in its glow.

Royce was a good person, but we had missed our chance.

I had married Brandon to move on from this relationship, only to find myself on the wrong path.

In the following days, Royce didn't come back. He was probably angry at my suspicions.

After all, he had sincerely wanted to help me, and I had doubted him. It was understandable that he would be upset.

Bored at home, I decided to sort through my old things.

Fortunately, my parents were sentimental, so all my childhood belongings were still in my room, untouched.

Holly helped me as we moved boxes of my old stuff.

A thin layer of dust had settled on top, making me sneeze.

I held my breath and cleaned the boxes. Thankfully, the contents were still clean.

In the corner, I suddenly found a doll and excitedly pulled it out. "I used to play with this when I was little. I can't believe it's still here."

Holly smiled. "Mrs. Kelly Sharp and Mr. Gerald Sharp really kept everything for you."

I nodded, eagerly sifting through my childhood memories.

There were also my old certificates, a thick stack neatly stored in a cloth bag.

Brett curiously came over to see what we were doing. I showed him the certificates. "These are the awards I won. Impressive, right?"

Brett nodded. "Mommy is the best!"

At the bottom, I found a photo album with a family picture from my elementary school graduation.

The photo had yellowed with age, showing the passage of time.

I wiped it clean with a tissue and placed it on my bedside table.

I had always regretted not having enough family photos, but this one made up for it.

After organizing everything, it was already dark.

Holly took Brett to bed, and I turned off the lights and lay down.

As I turned over, I accidentally knocked the photo frame off the bedside table.

Startled, I quickly got up to clean it up. When I turned on the light, I saw a letter among the broken glass.

The letter looked new, preserved by the frame.

Puzzled, I picked it up and opened it.

The old ink smell wafted up, and I recognized Gerald's handwriting.

"My dearest daughter Caroline, if you're reading this, I'm probably gone."

I stared in disbelief. Was this letter from Gerald to me?

"When I got sick, you smiled to cheer up your mom, but I knew you were hurting. You just put on a brave face. So, I was reluctant to leave because I worried about you."

Tears streamed down my face, falling onto the letter.

"I regret not spending more time with you. The only things I can leave you are the old houses I bought years ago and this letter."

"What I'm about to tell you, I hope you never need to know."

"Brandon is not trustworthy. I don't want you to marry him, but I can't stop you if you love him."

"But I hope you'll be cautious. I can see Brandon's ambition, and I'm afraid he'll deceive you."

I couldn't believe Gerald had seen the problem so early.

"If the company faces trouble or he takes control, don't confront him directly. He's cunning and might harm you."

"I have shares in a company in Suncrest City. Your mom knows about it. Use that money if you need to deal with him."

"The Jordan family is united, so if it comes to that, start by weakening them from within."

"Of course, I hope you'll never need this."

"Lastly, I want to say I love you and wish you a life of smooth sailing and happiness."

The letter ended there.

But I couldn't stop crying, feeling as if Gerald were right there comforting me.

###chapter 85

After I told Kelly about the letter, she looked a bit surprised.

"Your dad did write a letter when he was in the hospital, but he never told me where he put it. I didn't expect it to be behind that photo."

I nodded. "Maybe he wanted me to find it."

"By the way, Mom, Dad mentioned some company shares in the letter. Do you know what that's about?"

Kelly nodded. "Yeah, I do."

"Your dad had it all set up for you."

Kelly walked over to Gerald's old desk and pulled out a share transfer agreement, already signed by Gerald.

"This is the last thing your dad left for you. He told me to give it to you when you asked about it."

I was deeply moved, tears welling up in my eyes.

The person who loves a princess the most isn't always a prince, but it's always a king.

Kelly handed me the agreement and then went back to her room alone. She was probably feeling pretty emotional too.

I signed the agreement and let out a slow breath.

This was the greatest sense of security Gerald had left for me.

With this money, I would face Brandon and his crew with even more determination.

I hadn't heard from Royce in days, and I thought he might have gone back.

Until one day, while I was out for a walk, I unexpectedly ran into Royce.

He turned around when he heard me, his expression calm and distant, almost otherworldly.

"So, you didn't leave."

I laughed awkwardly, not knowing what to say.

Royce stared at me without speaking, making me feel inexplicably uneasy.

I cleared my throat. "You go ahead and take your time. I'm heading home."

The awkward atmosphere was too much for me, and I planned to make a quick exit.

But just as I turned around, Royce caught up to me and grabbed my hand. "Wait."

I froze, not daring to move.

After a moment, he said, "Asher is back too. Aren't you going to see him?"

I turned around, a bit excited. "Really?"

That's when I noticed the hint of anger in Royce's eyes. He let go of my hand and responded in a low voice.

I didn't pay attention to his mood and took a cab to Asher's hotel.

I knocked on the door, and Asher opened it.

He looked completely different, almost radiant. "Asher, why did you come back all of a sudden?"

Asher was happy to see me too. "Caroline, who told you? Royce?"

I nodded. Royce appeared at the door, his face still cold and silent.

He had been inexplicably angry since we got in the car, and I had no idea why.

I looked at Asher. "Asher, you look so much better than before."

Asher ran a hand through his hair. "Really? Come on in."

Royce walked in and sat in an executive chair in the room.

Asher and I sat down. "Asher, why didn't you go see your parents? Why are you staying at a hotel?"

Asher fell silent. "Caroline, I wanted to, but I'm afraid of putting them in danger. I don't even dare to go out and see people."

I fell silent too. When I first came back, I visited Asher's parents. They were still under the impression that Asher was abroad for work and couldn't call often.

Brandon must have sent someone to tell them that, which saved me from having to explain. So, I didn't contradict it.

Asher's parents were getting on in years, but they were in good spirits.

I told Asher about their situation, and he thanked me. "I just wanted to be closer to them. I don't have any other plans."

I nodded, fully understanding his feelings.

It was all Brandon's fault. That bastard had done so many terrible things. He deserved to pay!

After some small talk, we got down to business.

"I have a friend named Joanna. She's willing to help me."

"Brandon is eager to break into the overseas market. To achieve that, he's willing to do anything, so we can use this opportunity to make our move."

Asher nodded. "Brandon is the kind of person who only focuses on immediate gains and never considers the bigger picture."

"When I was still at the company, he got mad at me for not taking on a certain project, but he completely missed the fact that the partner company was about to go under. We need to use this to our advantage."

I nodded. "I've already asked Joanna to help me arrange for a foreign company to conduct a financial audit. That's when you'll need to step in."

I looked at Royce. That would be the moment I could finally take back the company.

Royce nodded. "It's a good plan, but we also need to be careful of the other people in their company. We don't want them to mess things up."

###chapter 86

"Earl and Brandon have already had their fallout at the company, so they're not much of a threat anymore."

"The only ones worth noting are Renee and Irene, but Renee doesn't care about the company's affairs, so that leaves just Irene."

"She's a tricky one. Easy to deal with in some ways, but difficult in others."

"What do you mean?"

I thought back to my impression of Irene. "Irene is all about the money. She only cares about her own interests and would throw the company's interests under the bus for her own gain."

She almost went to jail for embezzling company funds when she was an accountant. I had to pull some strings and pay back the money to get her out of that mess.

Royce nodded. "That's good for us. We should be glad our enemy has such a glaring weakness."

"And only Joanna can handle this. Irene won't trust anyone else."

Royce was echoing my thoughts, and I nodded in agreement.

With the audit coming up in a few days, I got up and called Joanna.

She picked up quickly. "What's up? Are you worried about Brandon?"

I chuckled. "I trust you to handle things. I just need a favor."

"Go ahead, don't be shy with me."

"I feel bad asking for so much, but since you insist... There's a high-ranking executive at Brandon's company named Irene. I need you to bribe her for me. She won't trust anyone else but you."

"Got it. No problem."

Joanna agreed without hesitation. I was about to say I'd pay her back once it was done, but she got a bit annoyed. "Why do you always bring that up? I help you because I like you. Talking about money ruins it."

I quickly apologized. "Sorry, I didn't mean to treat you like an outsider. I'll treat you to dinner once it's done."

"That's more like it."

I hung up, feeling relieved, and turned to Royce and Asher. "Joanna's on board."

With Joanna's help, the plan was almost 80% complete.

We all relaxed a bit, and Asher started chatting with me.

"You know, after you left to have the baby, I felt something was off at the company."

I glanced at Royce, who was making tea with the hotel's disposable cups as if they were fine china. He had an air of elegance that was hard to miss.

"What happened?"

Royce handed me a cup of tea, but before I could drink, he touched my wrist with two fingers. "It's hot!"

I obediently put the cup down.

Asher didn't notice our interaction and continued talking.

"After you left, Brandon brought Earl into the company, and soon after, Irene joined as the deputy CFO. It didn't sit right with me, but I thought it wasn't a big deal. Earl was useless, and I could keep Irene in check until you returned."

"But then Brandon started firing your old friends one by one, with Elora's help. She knew the company inside out and got close to Brandon. Their relationship was definitely more than professional."

"Elora studied us veterans and found reasons to fire each of us. It started to feel suspicious."

"I wanted to contact you to find out what was going on, but Brandon wouldn't let me see you, and you didn't answer my calls. We lost touch."

Asher looked at me, anger in his eyes. "I later found out what Brandon did to you. That bastard deserves the worst."

Royce had been listening quietly but spoke up now. "If Elora was so important, would Brandon really let her go so easily?"

I shook my head. "Brandon likes to mess around, but he doesn't tolerate it from his subordinates. He might have ditched Elora, just like he might ditch Earl to bring in new people."

Just then, my phone rang. Seeing Elora's name on the screen, I thought it was quite the coincidence.

I showed the screen to Royce and Asher before answering. "Hello?"

"Caroline, this is all your doing, isn't it?"

I put the call on speaker so they could hear her hysterical voice.

"You set Kurt up to get close to me, then had his wife catch us and record it. You spread the video and stirred up public opinion, exposing me and Brandon. Then you released photos of me and Earl, shifting the blame onto us. You helped Brandon get rid of me and pushed Earl out of the core business. You're so vicious!"

I couldn't believe she was playing the victim. "Vicious? You seduced Brandon while I was sick and pregnant. I promoted you from a regular employee to a manager, and now you call me vicious? Didn't you do all those things?"

"So what? Brandon never loved you. He was only with you for your money. Do you think he loves you? Don't kid yourself."

I laughed coldly. "Really? Do you have money? You might be beautiful, but Brandon still dumped you without a second thought."

"Ask Brandon if he dares to divorce me."

Elora knew the answer. Brandon wouldn't dare. If he had to choose between us, he'd pick me because of my money.

Elora gritted her teeth. "Caroline, don't get too comfortable. One day, you'll get what's coming to you, and I'll be there to laugh."

I smirked. "We'll see if you can still laugh when that day comes."

Elora's voice grew shrill. "You think getting rid of me will make Brandon faithful? He has other women, and one of them is someone you can't mess with!"

###chapter 87

I don't know why, but when I heard Elora's last words, I caught a hint of fear in her voice.

What kind of woman could make Elora so willing to endure and still feel afraid?

I thought about the women around Brandon and realized none of them seemed capable of instilling such fear in Elora.

Suddenly, I remembered the woman with the spider lily profile picture who had been flirting with Brandon. Their chat history suggested their relationship was quite unusual. Could it be her?

I decided to ask Simon to look into this woman more closely.

Just then, Simon sent me a video.

I played it in front of the two people with me. In the video, Earl stormed into Brandon's office, slamming his hand on the desk.

"Where's Jason?" Earl demanded angrily.

I was taken aback. What happened to Jason?

Brandon casually looked at his phone, not even raising an eyebrow. "How should I know?"

Earl was furious. "Don't forget, Jason is also your..."

"My what?" Brandon looked up, his gaze cold and piercing. "You want to say my child?"

"I really treated Jason as my heir, but it turns out he's your child with someone else. I've been raising someone else's son all this time, and you have the nerve to say that?"

Earl gritted his teeth. "Don't you have any feelings for him at all? How can you be so heartless?"

"Yes, I am that heartless. Now get out!"

Earl, in a fit of rage, grabbed Brandon by the collar. "Bring Jason out!"

The video cut off abruptly, but it was clear that Brandon probably called security to drag Earl out.

However, when Elora called me earlier, she didn't seem aware of this video. Otherwise, she would have been a wreck.

When did this happen? I couldn't figure it out.

I glanced at Royce and said, "Maybe I should go back. If something happens before the verification, all our plans will be for nothing."

Royce nodded. "I agree. At least if you go back, they won't dare to act too recklessly."

Just then, Brandon called me.

I quickly signaled Asher and Royce to be quiet and answered slowly. "Realized your mistake?"

"Yeah, I know I was wrong, babe. I shouldn't have had any contact with Elora. She's just a shameless tramp!"

I smirked. "Good that you know. Why are you calling?"

"Nothing much, just wanted to ask when you're coming back. I miss you, babe."

I glanced at Royce, who was looking down, hiding any sign of guilt.

I replied coldly, "Why do you care? I'll come back when I want to. You'll know when the time comes."

I knew that with Eugene at home, no one could stop me from returning whenever I decided to.

Brandon was at a loss for words and didn't ask further. He just spewed some nauseating sweet talk, which made me feel sick.

I quickly found an excuse to hang up and let out a long sigh of relief.

After leaving with the two of them, I took Royce's car home.

I stared at the night scenery outside, feeling a heavy weight in my chest.

The car stopped, and Royce patted my hand. "Don't worry, everything will pass."

For some reason, I felt touched at that moment.

Maybe Royce saw that I didn't want to talk, so he just offered a simple word of comfort, but it meant a lot to me.

When I got home, I told Kelly I needed to go back.

Kelly looked at me sharply. "What's going on with you and Brandon?"

"What do you mean? I know about the online rumors!"

I knew I couldn't hide it, so I smiled and explained, "It's nothing. Brandon cheated with a female employee, and I'm dealing with it."

Kelly was furious, slamming the table as she stood up. "He dared to cheat? You need to divorce him immediately!"

I quickly reassured her. "I know, Mom, but this can't be rushed. I plan to make sure Brandon leaves with nothing."

Hearing this, Kelly calmed down.

I didn't tell her about being poisoned. Otherwise, with her personality, she would drag me back to get a divorce right away.

"Mom, I think the three kids and Holly should stay with you. I don't know what will happen when I go back. Is that okay?"

Kelly was delighted. "Of course, they can stay. Having them here makes me happier than having you here."

I knew Kelly was just venting. She was still mad that I hadn't told her directly about coming back.

The next morning, I packed a few things and said goodbye to Holly before leaving.

On the first flight out, I was surprised to find Royce sitting next to me.

I was taken aback. "What are you doing here?"

Royce smiled, his sunglasses hiding his eyes. "Ms. Sharp, don't forget I need to go back too. It just so happens we booked the same flight. Is there a problem?"

His tone was odd, reminding me of his inexplicable anger yesterday.

"Can you tell me why you were angry yesterday?"

He stared at me, making me uncomfortable. "You really don't know?"

I shook my head honestly. Royce scoffed.

"You're really dense, you know that? A blockhead."

I was baffled by the new nickname. "Say it or don't, you petty man!"

I pulled down my sleep mask, not noticing Royce's long gaze after I did.

When the plane landed, I saw Kathy waiting for me outside the airport.

I hugged her, and she noticed Royce behind me, carrying my luggage.

Her eyes widened, and she pointed between us. "You two?"

I grabbed her hand. "Don't overthink it. We were on the same flight, and he was kind enough to help with my luggage."

Kathy pouted. "Why have I never been on the same flight as my ex?"

Royce put my luggage in Kathy's trunk.

Kathy smiled. "Want to join us for a meal?"

Royce shook his head. "No, I have some things to do. You two enjoy. It's on me."

###chapter 88

Kathy rubbed her hands together with a mischievous grin. "Oh, I feel so embarrassed."

Royce waved his hand dismissively, and soon a car arrived to whisk him away.

Once he was gone, I turned to Kathy and demanded, "Why did he suddenly go to Suncrest City? Was this your doing?"

Kathy initially avoided my gaze, but eventually, she nodded reluctantly.

"I was just thinking about your future. After your divorce from Brandon, don't you plan on finding someone new?"

"I noticed Royce hasn't married all these years. Maybe he's been waiting for you."

I was taken aback and quickly denied it. "Come on, that's impossible."

"Besides, I have three kids now. Why would anyone want to suddenly become a father to three children?"

Kathy sighed. "Why do you think like that?"

"So what if you have three kids? Your figure is still great, and you're beautiful. With a bit of self-care, you could look like a young woman again. Why wouldn't he like you?"

"Even if he doesn't, that's his loss!"

I knew Kathy was trying to cheer me up, but it still made me happy.

I playfully tapped her forehead with my finger. "Stop flattering me. I'm starving. Want to grab a bite with me?"

Kathy nodded, and we found a restaurant near the airport.

As we ate, I brought up the topic of Jason's disappearance.

"What do you think?"

Kathy snorted. "Jason's just unlucky. His mom did so many bad things, and now she's facing the consequences."

"But," she continued, "Jason is innocent. I hope they find him soon."

I shook my head. "I have a feeling there's something fishy going on."

She looked at me curiously. "What do you mean?"

"Think about it. Brandon is about to finalize an overseas deal, and now this happens. I checked my phone after landing, and all I saw were missing child alerts for Elora's son. Doesn't it seem like someone is behind this?"

"You have a point," Kathy mused. "I hadn't paid much attention, but because I'm in this city, I kept getting notifications about Jason's disappearance. It does seem unusual."

I nodded and continued, "I think Jason might not be missing at all. Someone could be trying to sabotage Brandon."

"Just wait and see. The rumors will probably say Jason is Brandon's son and Elora is his mistress."

Kathy frowned. "Who would do that? What would they gain?"

"Besides, the overseas deal was a setup by us and Joanna. No one else knows about it. So who could it be?"

I smiled mysteriously. "There might not be a direct beneficiary, but Brandon losing out is crucial for some people."

Kathy's eyes lit up. "You mean Earl!"

I nodded. "He was the first to tell Brandon about the missing child. Elora was threatening me on the phone just moments before, so she either doesn't know or is pretending not to."

"Once this blows up, everyone will think Brandon has a mistress and a possible illegitimate child. Do you think the overseas deal will still go through?"

Kathy nodded. "Caroline, you really see things clearly!"

I shook my head. "If you were in my shoes, you'd see it too. This environment forces me to think this way."

Kathy sighed and patted my shoulder. "Isn't it exhausting to live like this? It's all Brandon and his cronies' fault. They've pushed you to this point."

I smiled wryly. The people who hurt you never consider these things.

I've gotten used to it and have no choice but to adapt.

After finishing our meal, Kathy drove me home.

As soon as we arrived, I saw a crowd gathered at my doorstep.

The moment I approached, they swarmed around me.

"Excuse me, are you Brandon's wife, Caroline?"

I nodded. "Yes, what is it?"

"There's a rumor online that Ms. Kingsley, the mother of the missing child, is your husband's mistress. Do you know about this?"

I nodded. "I don't know, but even if he made a mistake, I can forgive him."

The reporter pressed on. "Do you know your husband might have an illegitimate child with Elora?"

I stopped in my tracks. "I said I don't know. What does this have to do with me? Isn't that child Brandon's brother's?"

The reporter continued, "Now that the child is missing, Ms. Kingsley suspects you might have kidnapped him out of anger over Mr. Jordan's affair."

I stood firm and looked directly into the camera. "I'm a mother of three. Even if I knew about this, I would never harm a child. Anyone who does is a monster."

I turned to the reporter. "Is that clear?"

The reporter nodded, stunned. "Yes, it's clear."

Kathy stepped in front of me, parting the crowd. "She's not feeling well. We need to go."

With that, I entered the house and shut the door.

Inside, I saw Brandon pacing anxiously.

When he saw me, he rushed over.

"Honey, do you have anything to do with the missing child?"

His eyes were bloodshot, clearly from a sleepless night.

I sneered. "First, tell me what your relationship with that child is."

"That's not important," Brandon said urgently. "Do you know this is affecting the overseas deal?"

"If that's not important, then what is?"

I glared at Brandon, my eyes filled with anger. "Are my kids and I not important to you?"

"I've already forgiven your affair, and you still can't tell me the truth?"

Brandon gritted his teeth. "I don't know."

I rolled my eyes and headed upstairs.

Brandon tried to follow, but Kathy blocked him. "What are you doing? Adding to Caroline's stress?"

"You..."

Brandon was furious, pointing at Kathy.

But because I was there, he couldn't curse her out.

He could only mutter, "This is our family matter. What does it have to do with you?"

Kathy snorted. "How does it not? Caroline's problems are my problems. You cheated, and you don't want people to talk about it? Despicable man!"

Brandon was so angry he couldn't speak and stormed downstairs.

I watched him from the second-floor railing, feeling nothing but cold amusement.

###chapter 89

A swarm of reporters crowded around my front door, causing the neighbors to call and complain.

Brandon was juggling calls from the media and the neighbors, and finally, he snapped.

"Those reporters showed up on their own! How is this my fault?"

"If you're annoyed, move to another neighborhood, or kick them out yourself. Don't come to me, damn it!"

He vented his frustration into the phone, then collapsed onto the couch, breathing heavily.

Kathy and I watched from the second floor. She smirked, "Brandon's about to lose it."

I chuckled, "Just wait, the real show is yet to come!"

Hearing this, Kathy's anticipation grew.

Soon, the door was flung open, and a few people barged in.

It was Earl and Karen, with Renee in tow!

"Brandon, where's that bitch Caroline?"

They stormed in, looking like they were ready to kill me.

Brandon, still on the couch, pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. "What now?"

"I asked you, where's that bitch Caroline? Tell her to bring Jason back!"

I leaned over the second-floor railing, looking down at them. "Who's looking for me?"

Karen looked up, her eyes narrowing with malice. "You bitch, get down here!"

She started to charge up the stairs, ready to hit me.

Brandon, exasperated, blocked her way. "Mom, can you stop? What do you want?"

Karen glared at him. "Brandon, you're siding with her? Caroline took your son!"

"He's not my son!"

Brandon finally exploded. "That kid is Elora's and Earl's! What does that have to do with me? Or you?"

Renee stepped forward, arms crossed. "Brandon, did you get a paternity test? How do you know he's not yours?"

Earl, also with arms crossed, sneered at Brandon. "Yeah, Brandon, how can you be so sure? What if he is yours? Aren't you worried about your kid?"

Seeing this family airing their dirty laundry, Kathy rolled her eyes.

"I've seen shameless people, but this is a new low. Caroline's right here, and you're already talking about illegitimate children? How can you be so shameless?"

Karen glared at Kathy. "Shut up! This is our family business. Say one more word, and I'll tear your mouth apart!"

Kathy rolled her eyes again. "Tear my mouth apart? Look at you, doing such despicable things at your age. Aren't you afraid of dropping dead?"

"You..."

Karen pointed at Kathy, her hand shaking with rage.

Brandon glanced at Kathy. "Enough, you should say less."

I rolled my eyes and led Kathy downstairs.

"Why should she say less? I think she's right!"

"Whose kid is it? I need an answer today. Brandon, if it's your illegitimate child, the Sharp family won't accept you as a son-in-law. You'll leave with nothing!"

"Why should Brandon leave with nothing? Look at you now, it's a miracle we haven't kicked you out."

"What do you mean?"

I sneered. "How much has Brandon benefited from marrying me?"

"If it weren't for me, would you be dressed so decently?"

"When I first visited your place, it was a dump. You and Renee were sleeping on a bed crawling with roaches, Brandon on the couch, and you didn't even have a dining table. You ate on the kitchen counter."

"If it weren't for me, would you be living in a mansion?"

Karen's face twisted with anger. She hated when people brought up the past.

Renee's expression was just as dark. "What's the point of saying all this? We're here to get the child back."

Karen snapped back to reality. "Exactly, you wretched woman, give us our child back!"

"I bring bad luck? If I brought bad luck, would Brandon be where he is now? Who's really bringing bad luck? Your husband died early, didn't he?"

I was referring to Karen's husband, the father of these kids. He had died of illness years ago, leaving Karen to raise the children alone, which is why they were in such a sorry state.

Brandon's face was grim. "Enough, Caroline, watch your mouth. No matter what, she's still my mom."

"Mom?" I laughed. "She says I bring bad luck, isn't she cursing you? I'm just standing up for you, honey."

Karen gritted her teeth. "Say one more word, and I'll tear your mouth apart!"

I crossed my arms, looking at her. "Try touching me."

We stared each other down, tension crackling in the air.

Finally, Earl spoke, pretending to be reasonable. "Caroline, no matter whose child it is, you shouldn't have taken him. He's a Jordan family child."

"And now, with all the rumors flying around, everyone thinks you kidnapped him. How will you handle that?"

Though Earl's words seemed to advise me, he was actually accusing me.

I sneered. "Handle it? There's nothing to handle. I didn't kidnap your child. We can call the police if you want."

"So what if there are rumors? You two sleeping with the same woman isn't embarrassing, but I should be?"

Earl frowned, falling silent.

Karen glared at me. "You little bitch, you dare talk back. If I call the police, you'll have no way out, understand?"

I rolled my eyes, about to speak, when the noise outside grew louder.

Elora had arrived, crying and demanding her child back, as if her tears could erase her recent infidelities.

Karen turned to me. "Do you hear that? Look what you've done to Elora. Hand over the child now!"

I shrugged innocently. "I didn't take the child. What am I supposed to hand over?"

"If you're so sure I kidnapped him, call the police!"

Karen and her crew were all talk, none of them actually calling the police, as if they could find the child by arguing.

Kathy and I exchanged a glance, and she instantly understood.

"None of you are calling? Fine, I'll call."

Kathy said, reaching for her phone.

Karen's face changed, and she lunged to grab the phone.

But Kathy dodged, standing on the stairs. "What are you doing? Aren't you anxious to find the child? Why don't you want me to call the police?"

"I get it." Kathy pretended to understand. "You hid the child yourselves to frame Caroline, didn't you?"

At this, they exchanged guilty looks, their eyes betraying their unease.

###chapter 90

Brandon started to have second thoughts.

"Mom, aren't you in a rush to find the kids? Why not let her call the cops?"

Karen's expression shifted. "If we call the police, Caroline might get arrested. What happens to the kids then?"

She shot me a threatening look. "Listen, child trafficking is a serious crime. Don't push us to the edge."

I rolled my eyes and turned to Kathy. "Call the police. I haven't trafficked any kids."

Kathy nodded and dialed without hesitation.

Karen instinctively tried to stop her, but seeing all of us watching, she pulled back and pointed at me menacingly. "Just you wait!"

Outside, Elora was still crying and pleading, strategically positioning herself right under the camera, bowing wherever it pointed.

The visual impact exploded online, trending with the headline: "Mother bows to human trafficker to find her child!"

The comments were brutal: "Who is this woman? How can she be so bold, snatching a child in broad daylight? Is there no law anymore?"

"I heard she has three kids of her own, yet she traffics others'. Disgusting!"

"Call the police, arrest her! Don't let human traffickers roam free!"

Some comments recalled past events.

"I remember this woman is a mistress, so her kids are...?"

This comment was quickly countered: "So what if she's a mistress? Right now, she's just a mother who lost her child!"

The private messages were even worse, cursing not only me but also Kelly and my kids.

I could handle the insults directed at me, but not at Kelly and my kids.

I blocked Karen and her group. "If you push me too far, I will fight back. If it's not me, I will find out who is spreading these rumors and make sure you go to jail."

Karen glanced at Earl behind her.

Earl avoided eye contact, pretending not to see.

Soon, the police arrived.

The reporters outside shouted, "The police are here! The police are here to take the human trafficker away!"

I stood inside as three officers came in and asked, "Who is Caroline?"

I raised my hand. "They say I'm a human trafficker and that I kidnapped that crazy woman's child outside, but I've been in Suncrest City these past few days. I have surveillance and flight tickets as proof. They're all slandering me. I request to preserve the evidence chain."

Hearing that I hadn't been home these past few days, Karen and her group's faces changed instantly.

In their minds, I had been home all along. They never expected I wouldn't be.

The police looked at Karen. "Then you come with us too."

Karen's legs went weak immediately. "Sir, even if she wasn't in Suncrest City, she could have instructed someone else to steal the child. You must not let her go!"

I rolled my eyes. This self-righteous fool still thought she could frame me at this point.

"We need evidence. You say she stole the child, where's your evidence?"

Karen was speechless, and Renee didn't dare step forward.

She was most afraid of encountering police who could smell drugs, so she stayed far away.

Earl, fearing being implicated, also didn't dare come over.

In the end, only Karen was taken away!

I followed the police, walking leisurely.

The reporters outside saw the door open, and as Karen and I walked out together, they pointed their cameras at us.

Elora saw me come out and rushed over like a madwoman, "Officer, it's her! She stole my child!"

"My child has been missing for a long time. I'm worried sick about her."

She spoke so movingly that many people cried on the spot.

The police said, "If you have evidence, please submit it to us. If not, please wait for the investigation results."

Elora fell silent, as she only had her words to accuse me.

Karen had never been in a police car before, and feeling guilty, she was terrified, crouching under the seat, wailing.

The police helped her up, but seeing the gun on the officer's waist, she fainted from fear.

So the police car changed course halfway and took Karen to the emergency room.

I contacted Brandon and Earl, asking them to take care of Karen while I went to the police station to give my statement.

At the station, I followed the officers, truthfully recounting my activities over the past few days. After that, they let me go home to wait for the investigation results.

When I got home, Kathy was still there, sitting on the couch.

The reporters outside had all left.

"You're back? I saw your family rush off after a phone call. What happened?"

I laughed, "Karen was so scared she almost wet herself in the police car, so she ended up in the emergency room."

Kathy was stunned, then burst into laughter.

"Serves her right. Karen has done too many bad things."

I smiled and said nothing.

That evening, Brandon came home, looking exhausted, loosening his tie.

I asked, "Is your mom okay?"

Brandon shook his head, "She's fine."

I snorted, "You shouldn't have gone."

Brandon suddenly opened his eyes, staring at me.

"Caroline, I think you're too hostile towards my mom. She's still our mom. Can't you calm down a bit?"

I rolled my eyes, "Haven't you figured it out yet?"

"I was speaking up for you today."

Brandon was taken aback, frowning at me, "What do you mean?"

I said, "Don't you find it strange? Why did Elora's child go missing just as you were about to open up the overseas market?"

Brandon still didn't understand, "It's not uncommon for a child to go missing, but what does that have to do with my overseas business?"

I shook my head helplessly, "It's not common for a child to go missing, but have you ever seen such a big fuss made, yet the person involved refuses to call the police?"

Brandon finally recalled the oddities of the day, slowly standing up, "What do you mean?"

"You're about to have your funds verified, right? This will determine whether you succeed. Now, there's a massive smear campaign against you and me online."

"You're caught in the mistress scandal, and I'm accused of child trafficking. Do you think Joanna will be happy about this?"

Brandon froze, "You mean to say?"

"Think about it. If your overseas business fails, who benefits the most?"

Brandon stared at me, "Earl!"

"Could this be their setup?"

###chapter 91

I nodded, giving him a look that said, "Finally, you get it."

"Let's start with Earl. You had a falling out with him at the company, so there's no way he wants to see you succeed, right? And Elora knows she can't be with you anymore, so she teamed up with Earl to stage this whole thing. I'm sure the kid is still with them."

Brandon seemed to understand, but also didn't: "But what about my mom? And Renee?"

I paused for a moment, looking at Brandon. "I don't know Renee well, but isn't she the one calling the shots in your family?"

Brandon fell silent, probably thinking about the situation in Southeast Asia. After all, he couldn't discuss that with me.

"If you close this overseas deal, do you think Renee can still control you? Her biggest fear is you slipping out of her grasp. Your mom probably thinks the same way."

"Brandon, you need to wake up. I'm the only one in this family who's on your side."

"If I hadn't acted the way I did earlier today, Joanna would have blown up your phone by now, telling you the deal was off!"

Brandon finally realized, his face turning pale.

He gritted his teeth. "I get it, honey. Thank you."

I believed he was sincere. After all, Brandon valued his interests above all else.

He lowered his head in silence for a moment, then suddenly looked up at me. "Honey, you've been back for a while now. Where's the kid?"

I was taken aback, not expecting him to change the subject so quickly.

"The kid is with my mom. I thought it would be easier for you to focus on the verification process if I came back alone. Once it's done, I'll go back. I haven't spent enough time with my mom this trip."

Brandon looked at me for a long time. "Next time you want to see our mom, let me know. I'll go with you."

I didn't know what he was thinking, so I just nodded. "Got it."

Brandon sat for a long time, then suddenly stood up. "Honey, I'm going out for a bit. You should get some rest."

I looked at him. "Tomorrow is the verification day. Make sure you're prepared."

Brandon's face was unreadable, but he nodded and left.

I had a feeling something was off with Brandon, but I couldn't pinpoint what.

I thought for a while, then called Kelly. After checking on the three kids, I felt a bit more at ease.

The day's events had drained me, and I was exhausted. I went to bed and fell asleep quickly.

When I woke up, it was already the next morning.

Today was the day the foreign company was coming to verify the funds. If Brandon wanted to secure this deal, he had to transfer the money back from overseas.

Just then, Paula unexpectedly asked to meet.

We arranged to meet at a secluded café. Paula was already there when I arrived.

She saw me and said, "Mrs. Jordan, I know where Jason is."

I was shocked. I never expected Paula to drop such a bombshell right away.

"Are you sure? The whole city is looking for Jason."

Paula nodded. "The kid was never lost. Shirley took him."

I was stunned. "Shirley? Why?"

Paula continued, "Why else? Brandon's orders. Shirley might be crazy, but she wouldn't dare touch the Jordan family's kid without Brandon's approval."

A chill ran down my spine.

I thought of Brandon's gloomy face last night. Was he acting the whole time?

But why would he act? Did he figure out my plan and want to sabotage the overseas deal?

But he seemed so dedicated to securing this deal. Why would he do this?

I couldn't make sense of it, so I looked at Paula.

"Are you sure?"

Paula nodded. "I'm sure. I recorded their conversation."

I was thrilled and asked Paula to play the recording.

She opened her phone's recording app, and I heard a commotion.

Then Brandon's voice: "I'm so pissed. Elora is such a bitch, cheating on me with Earl while being my lover!"

Then Shirley's voice: "Mr. Jordan, calm down. I suspect your illness came from Elora. I saw her go into a hotel with a man."

"Fuck, that bitch!"

Brandon seemed to throw something in anger.

Shirley seized the opportunity to drive a wedge between them.

"If Elora had your child, it would be one thing. But now the kid is Earl's. Why not just kick them out? They're just in the way."

"Bullshit, Jason is my kid!"

I was stunned and exchanged glances with Paula.

She nodded, signaling me to keep listening.

"What?"

Shirley was taken aback, her voice unsteady but trying to sound gentle. "But there are photos of Earl and that boy in the news."

"Earl must be mistaken, but I'm sure Jason is my kid."

"Now Caroline is mad at me because of this. She ran back to her hometown without a word. She never used to do that. She's been getting more defiant lately."

"She'll eventually demand a paternity test for Jason. What then? Am I supposed to give up my own kid?"

Shirley was silent for a while, then suddenly spoke. "Why don't you secretly hide the kid for now?"

"That way, when Caroline wants a paternity test, she won't find the kid. Later, you can bring him back and forge the test results."

Brandon was silent, seemingly considering the plan's feasibility.

"Alright, let's do that. Be discreet."

The recording ended, and Paula looked at me. "That's all I have. That's why I'm so sure."

I nodded, trying to hide my thoughts from Paula. "Got it. You can go now."

After Paula left, I returned to my car, feeling deflated.

Brandon had been acting the whole time. He knew where the kid was from the start.

But why did things escalate like this? If the recording was real, Brandon just wanted to deceive me, not cause a public uproar.

So where did things go wrong?

As I pondered, I suddenly thought of someone.

Earl.

He was the mastermind behind all this. Maybe he figured out Brandon had taken the kid and played along, staging this drama to prevent Brandon from closing the deal.

And the online rumors were all orchestrated by him.

It all made sense now.

###chapter 92

The Jordan family sure knows how to play the game.

Both sides are putting on quite the show.

But what I told Brandon yesterday wasn't off the mark. With his sharp mind, he probably figured out that the storm brewing in the city was stirred up by Earl behind the scenes.

This family is something else. I thought Earl was plotting against Brandon, but it turns out they're both scheming against each other.

I drove home, knowing today was the day to verify the funds. All my planning over the past few weeks would come to fruition today.

As soon as I got home, my phone rang. It was Kathy.

She sounded frantic. "Something terrible has happened!"

I was taken aback and quickly asked, "What's wrong?"

"Elora is dead."

My mind went blank, and I felt a ringing in my ears.

I could hardly believe what I was hearing. "Say that again? How could Elora be dead?"

Kathy was almost in tears. "I'll send you a video."

She quickly sent over a video, which seemed to be recorded by Simon.

In the video, Elora was standing on a rooftop, with a crowd below trying to talk her down.

Most of them were cursing at me.

"This is too much, driving someone to this point."

"That woman not only kidnapped children but is also a potential murderer. Look at what she's done to people!"

"Don't jump! If you're going to die, take that woman with you!"

Elora ignored the voices behind her, raised her arms, and jumped, falling straight to the ground.

The last scene of the video showed Elora lying in a pool of blood, the ground stained red.

I was so shocked that I threw my phone away.

Kathy called again, and I stared at the ringing phone, my heart pounding, before finally picking it up.

"Caroline, don't go out these days. The online backlash over Elora's death is unprecedented. You need to stay home."

"I'll find someone to protect you. Just wait."

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to stay calm. "Can you find out why Elora jumped?"

Kathy nodded. "Simon is investigating now. We don't know what happened yet."

I hung up, my mind filled with the image of Elora's death.

But I didn't think Elora was the type to commit suicide. What could have driven her to such despair?

Suddenly, I thought of Jason. Could something have happened to him?

Panicking, I called Simon. "Hey, listen to me."

Sensing my distress, Simon spoke softly. "Calm down and speak slowly."

I took a deep breath. "I heard from Paula that Shirley took Jason. Can you check if something happened to Jason that made Elora desperate enough to kill herself?"

"I feel like there's more to this. Elora must have been driven to despair."

Simon nodded, his voice serious. "I understand. Don't go out. The public opinion is very unfavorable to you right now."

I murmured a response and went back to my room, drawing the curtains to rest.

I had to force myself to rest because there was nothing else I could do.

I fell into a light sleep, dreaming of Elora's jump.

In the dream, she stared at me with dead eyes.

Then she crawled out of the blood and came straight at me.

I woke up with a start, hearing noises from the kitchen.

Covered in cold sweat, I grabbed a vase and crept out of the room.

The noises continued in the kitchen. I rushed in, shouting, "Who's there?"

Just as I was about to smash the vase, it was caught firmly.

"It's me."

Royce's deep voice sounded. He looked at me and said, "Kathy called me, saying you weren't doing well, so I rushed back. How are you?"

I was stunned to see Royce. Fear and a mix of emotions overwhelmed me, making it hard to think.

I threw myself into Royce's arms, sobbing uncontrollably.

Royce hesitated, then hugged me tightly, patting my shoulder.

"It's okay. I'm here with you. Don't worry."

His comforting words gradually calmed me down.

He said, "I made some porridge for you. Have some."

I nodded and sat at the table, eating two bowls.

Royce said, "I'll clean up. You should go outside and get some sun. You look pale."

I nodded and stepped outside, only to see the front of my house splattered with red paint, the word "Murderer" scrawled across it.

The color was eerily similar to Elora's blood.

I was stunned and fainted on the spot.

When I woke up, Kathy and Royce were standing by my hospital bed, looking concerned.

"Caroline, how are you feeling? Any better?" Kathy asked as she saw me wake up.

I looked around, confused. "What happened to me?"

Royce, standing behind her, frowned. "You were too shocked. You've been unconscious since yesterday."

I was stunned, looking at the sunlight outside. "What about Brandon?"

Kathy seemed to know what I was worried about. "Don't worry. The funds have been verified, and the partnership is basically confirmed."

"After you fainted, Brandon held a press conference, announcing that you had nothing to do with the previous incidents and that you had reported it to the police."

"Once public opinion shifted, Brandon attended the fund verification ceremony."

I breathed a sigh of relief. Our efforts over the past few weeks hadn't been in vain.

Kathy tucked me in. "You should rest. Your health wasn't great to begin with, and the recent shocks have taken a toll. You'll need a long time to recover."

I nodded. Just then, someone burst into the room. It was Brandon.

"Honey, how are you?"

He rushed in and hugged me tightly.

He seemed unusually cheerful, as if celebrating something.

Anyone who didn't know better might think I'd just had a baby.

I forced a smile, suppressing my disgust as he held me.

Royce frowned and left the room.

Brandon didn't seem to notice, holding my shoulders. "I was so worried. Are you okay?"

Kathy rolled her eyes. "If you were so worried, why didn't you come sooner? I've been here all night."

Brandon's smile faltered, but he quickly recovered. "I was really busy yesterday, entertaining some foreign executives. If I don't secure the overseas sales channel, my wife will be mad at me."

Kathy couldn't stand his act and left the room.

Now it was just me and Brandon.

I looked at his cheerful face and asked, "What happened with Elora?"

###chapter 93

Brandon's smile faltered for a second, but he quickly covered it up.

"Yeah, I heard about that. Scared you, huh, babe?"

He looked at me seriously. "How could that have anything to do with me? You know I always play by the rules, especially now. There's no way I'd pull something like that."

His expression seemed sincere, but Brandon was a pro at lying, so I stayed skeptical.

"Babe, I saw a guy in your hospital room earlier. Who was he?" Brandon asked cautiously.

I knew he meant Royce. The less I seemed to care, the better.

"Who are you talking about?" I pretended to think for a moment. "Oh, that guy? No idea. Kathy brought him."

Brandon looked at me and said, "But I heard he was the one who carried you out of the house."

I shrugged nonchalantly. "I was freaked out after watching Elora's jump video, so I asked Kathy to come over. I knew you were busy today, so I didn't want to bother you."

"Kathy couldn't make it, so she sent her friend to keep me company."

I then looked at Brandon, feigning realization. "Are you suspicious of me?"

Brandon shook his head quickly. "No, I was just worried that guy might be dangerous."

"If you put it that way, I should thank him properly."

"No need. I've already asked Kathy to thank him for us. Now, tell me about what happened yesterday."

I smoothly changed the subject.

Luckily, this topic grabbed Brandon's interest, and he started talking excitedly.

"Let me tell you, yesterday the foreign company saw our assets and their eyes lit up. They all agreed to the partnership. I was hoping Francis would help with the introductions, but he barely had to say a word."

I couldn't help but laugh at his boasting. "Stop bragging."

He looked at me with wide eyes. "I'm not, babe. I'm telling you, our good days are just starting. Once we break into the overseas market, I'll probably have to travel there a lot. You'll need to take good care of yourself."

I nodded. "I know, babe. I won't add to your stress."

Brandon smiled slightly and said, "I have some follow-up work to handle at the office. I'll be going now."

He leaned in and kissed my forehead before leaving.

Once he was gone, I grabbed a few tissues and vigorously wiped the spot he kissed.

I've got him figured out now. If Brandon wants to play games, I'll play along.

Let's see who gets fooled in the end.

After Brandon left, Kathy came in. I asked her, "Where's Royce?"

Kathy clicked her tongue. "Royce just left, and you already miss him?"

I shook my head. "I haven't even thanked him yet. He practically saved my life."

Kathy plopped down on my hospital bed and took a bite of the apple beside her.

"Royce had to leave for something. I already thanked him for you, but he didn't seem too happy."

She gave me a mischievous look. "Maybe Royce wants you to thank him personally."

I couldn't help but push her. "Stop talking nonsense!"

"You're awake?"

At that moment, a voice came from the doorway.

Kathy and I turned to see Simon standing there, looking at us.

I knew Simon wouldn't show up without a reason, so he must have some news.

"Come on, what do you have for us?" I urged.

Simon chuckled. "How'd you know?"

Kathy rolled her eyes. "You usually vanish without a trace. You must have something important."

Simon nodded. "I do. I might have found out why Elora jumped."

I was taken aback and quickly urged him to continue.

Simon sat down in the chair opposite my bed. In the small space, he glanced outside and spoke in a low voice.

"Elora's autopsy report is out. They found a large amount of hallucinogens in her system."

"Hallucinogens?"

I was stunned. "So it wasn't because something happened to her child?"

Simon shook his head. "We can't be sure yet, but the hallucinogens are likely the reason she jumped."

He took out his phone and showed me a video. "I managed to get the rooftop footage of Elora's jump. Take a look."

He played the video for us.

Elora, in a white dress, walked stiffly from the rooftop stairs to the edge, like a lifeless zombie.

She stood on the edge of the rooftop wall and slowly turned around.

It might have been my imagination, but it seemed like she glanced at the camera.

Elora's eyes were vacant and eerie.

Then she spread her arms and fell backward without hesitation.

Kathy gasped in shock.

"She just died like that?"

Kathy's voice was shaky, but I understood her. Just a few hours ago, Elora was fine. What happened to her?

I looked at Simon. "Do you know who drugged her?"

Simon shook his head. "No, we're still investigating. Our people staked out Elora's villa and saw that she didn't leave after returning home. The next time she was seen was on the rooftop."

"She went there alone?"

Simon nodded.

I sighed. This was too much to process. "Did you find out where Elora's child is? Paula said Shirley took the child."

Simon nodded. "That's the second thing I wanted to tell you. Be careful with Paula."

I was taken aback. "Why?"

"I suspect she's either lying to you or hiding something."

"Since you told me about it, my people have been watching Shirley. There's no sign of her being connected to Jason. But that doesn't mean much, as Shirley wasn't a primary target before."

"Since you mentioned it, we've been watching Shirley 24/7, but she's done nothing suspicious."

"So I think Paula is either lying or hiding something."

I sighed deeply. "Why would she lie to me?"

Simon shook his head. "I don't know. We can only take it one step at a time. We need to gather as much information as possible to avoid being caught off guard."

I nodded and thanked Simon.

"Thank you. Without you, I'd still be in the dark. I might have ended up dead without knowing why."

Kathy patted my shoulder. "Don't say that. You're blessed. You've been through so much and come out fine. This time will be no different."

I nodded, hoping Kathy was right.

###chapter 94

There was another knock at the hospital room door. We all turned to see Joanna leading an unfamiliar woman inside.

I glanced at the woman behind Joanna. She was crying and looked completely devastated.

Joanna sighed. "Caroline, I know you're super busy, but I need to ask Simon for a favor for my friend."

I pointed at Simon. "You'll have to let him decide that."

Joanna nodded and stepped aside. The woman behind her suddenly rushed forward and knelt in front of Simon.

"I heard you're a famous detective. I need you to find out what really happened to my sister. I think my brother-in-law had something to do with it!"

She was sobbing uncontrollably. Kathy, looking sympathetic, helped her up and sat her on the hospital bed.

The woman continued, "My name is Isadora Penrose. My sister was Celestia Penrose, and her husband is Alfonso Carr, a jeweler in our city."

My eyes widened. "Celestia was the one in that car accident?"

Isadora nodded through her tears.

Years ago, there was a car accident that shocked the nation. Alfonso's wife, Celestia, was driving home with their kids when they went off a cliff. Everyone in the car, including Celestia, the driver, the nanny, and the two kids, died.

A video of Alfonso crying at the scene went viral, and everyone said he was a loving husband and father.

Since then, Alfonso never remarried and held annual memorials for his wife and kids.

Simon nodded, clearly familiar with the case. "Wasn't it determined that the brakes failed because the brake pads were worn out?"

I was surprised Simon remembered such an old case.

Isadora shook her head, and Joanna handed her a handkerchief.

"At first, I thought the same. But recently, while sorting through Celestia's things, I found some photos in Alfonso's study."

"At the site where Celestia and the kids died, Alfonso built a well. I asked around and found out it's supposed to trap their souls."

"Also, I discovered Alfonso had a mistress, even while Celestia was alive."

"I don't know if Celestia found out something or if Alfonso thought she was in the way, but something is definitely wrong."

"I went to the police, but they said I had no evidence. Alfonso is meticulous, so he wouldn't leave any clues. I had no choice but to come to you."

As she spoke, Isadora tried to kneel again.

Kathy quickly helped her up. "Simon, Ms. Penrose is in a desperate situation. Please help her."

Simon crossed his legs and looked at Isadora for a moment. "I can help, but my fees aren't cheap..."

Before he could finish, Joanna interrupted. "I'll cover all her expenses."

Isadora thanked Joanna and said, "As long as the truth about Celestia's death comes out, I'm willing to spend everything I have."

Simon nodded. "Alright, but I'm currently tied up with other cases. You'll need to gather the evidence yourself and bring it to me. I'll do my best to find the truth."

Isadora, now in tears, thanked him profusely.

Joanna stood up and escorted Isadora out. When she came back, she sighed and said to me, "She's just as unlucky as you."

I nodded.

If Alfonso really did this, I can't believe there are men like him in the world.

Brandon never even got to see his child born, and yet this man was so ruthless. Truly despicable.

Kathy looked curiously at Simon. "Didn't you say you weren't taking on cases like this anymore? What changed?"

Simon shook his head. "I've been interested in this case for years. I always found it odd but couldn't find anything conclusive."

"How could a family car's brake pads wear out to such an extreme? And they had a driver who would regularly check the vehicle. This situation is almost impossible unless the driver had a death wish."

"But I found out the driver had a mother and a newborn child and sent money home every month. It's unlikely he would do something like that, so there's a bigger issue here."

"Are you Sherlock Holmes or something?"

Kathy was stunned by his analysis, but I was more intrigued by Simon.

He didn't seem like an ordinary private detective. The fact that he got Elora's autopsy results so quickly suggested he had some unusual connections.

Maybe...

I shook my head. Regardless of his background, he's helping me now, so I shouldn't doubt him.

Simon gave a mysterious smile. "You all stay here. I have some things to take care of."

After Simon left, Kathy suddenly remembered. "Caroline, this is the hospital where you had your last check-up. We've been so busy we forgot to follow up on your recovery. Let's go check it out."

I nodded. "Sure."

We went to the same examination room as last time.

The doctor remembered me and nodded approvingly. "You look much better than last time."

I nodded. "Thank you for the prescription. It was very effective."

Even though I hadn't taken the medicine for a while, it had played a crucial role in my recovery.

The doctor nodded and had me sit down for an examination.

He placed his fingers on my wrist, thought for a moment, and then nodded in satisfaction.

"You're doing much better, but you're still quite weak. You need to continue with the supplements."

I was already pleased with this result. The last time I was here, the doctor said my condition was dire, so this improvement was significant. Living in such a stressful environment had taken its toll on me.

Kathy spoke to the doctor. "Doctor, it's not convenient for her to take those liquid medicines. Can you prescribe something easier to take?"

The doctor frowned. "Easier medicines won't be as effective as the liquid ones. Don't you want her to get better quickly?"

Kathy and I exchanged a wry smile. Of course, we wanted my health to improve quickly, but my current situation didn't allow me to brew and drink those medicines daily.

If Brandon saw them, he would realize I knew about his poisoning.

After much pleading, the doctor finally prescribed some convenient supplements for me.

###chapter 95

We picked up the medication and headed back to the hospital room. After thinking it over, I decided it would be better to stay at home. It was inconvenient here, and I couldn't keep an eye on Brandon. I still believed Elora's death had a lot to do with him.

Kathy agreed and helped me pack up. We got in the car and drove home. Just as we were leaving the hospital, I suddenly saw a familiar face.

He walked up to me and said, "Caroline."

I was surprised. It was Renee's husband, Leo Schmidt.

I hadn't seen Leo in a long time. The last time was at the Jordan family's Thanksgiving dinner. After I got sick, I stopped going to their family gatherings.

I could never quite figure out the relationship between Leo and Renee. Renee had many lovers, but Leo never seemed to mind. Every time he saw Renee, he looked at her with such love.

I heard that they were once a loving couple, but something happened to Renee later on.

Over the years, Renee was always out and about, while Leo stayed home, taking care of the kids and doing housework. He had become a stay-at-home dad.

"Leo, what brings you here?" I asked.

Leo smiled gently, his face soft and kind. "The kid's sick. I'm here to get some fever medicine."

Leo and Renee's child, Briar Schmidt, was a sweet little girl.

"I haven't seen Briar in ages. What grade is she in now?" I asked.

"She's in ninth grade," Leo replied with a proud smile.

I didn't know what kind of marriage Leo and Renee had, but he always seemed to be content.

I had heard that Leo's parents didn't approve of Renee because they thought she was too wild and unreliable. But Leo was smitten with her and insisted on marrying her. His parents refused to hold a wedding, hoping to drive Renee away.

Of course, Renee didn't agree to marry Leo without a wedding. Eventually, Leo worked and saved up for a few years to hold a wedding and bring Renee home.

"Why don't you bring Brett over to play with Briar sometime?" Leo suggested.

I replied, "The kids are at my mom's place right now. I dropped them off there when I went home."

"Why don't you let Briar go there for a little vacation? She can play with my kids. The weather in Suncrest City is beautiful and warm right now. It's not cold at all. Plus, with my kids around, you can rest easy. It's getting chilly here, so it might be nice for her to have a change of scenery."

Leo seemed tempted by the idea. "I'll have to discuss it with Renee."

"Renee is always so busy. Why don't you just take her there? I'm sure Renee will agree."

Leo hesitated for a moment but then agreed. "Alright, give me your contact information. I'll get in touch after Briar finishes her classes."

I nodded and gave him my phone number.

I really liked Briar. She was a quiet, delicate girl.

I didn't want Briar to stay here. I had a feeling that things were about to change with the Jordan family, and I didn't want her to get caught up in it. It would be better for her to go to Suncrest City and spend time with Brett and the others.

Leo looked like a scholar. I wasn't sure if he knew what Renee was up to, but it wasn't my business.

After chatting with Leo, he said goodbye and went to get the medicine. I was about to leave when Kathy suddenly grabbed my arm and said, "Wait, let's see where he's going."

I decided to stay and see where Leo was headed.

Sure enough, he didn't go to the outpatient clinic but to the inpatient department.

Kathy gave me a knowing look. "See? I told you Leo was lying."

I was stunned for a moment but then explained, "Maybe Leo has his reasons for not telling me. Let's not pry into his privacy. Let's go."

Kathy drove me home.

When we arrived, I saw someone standing at the door.

It was a woman with short, neat hair, wearing a black outfit and pants that showed off her long legs. She looked very sharp.

Seeing me, she approached and said, "You must be Ms. Sharp?"

I was taken aback and asked, "Who are you?"

The woman smiled and said, "I'm Savannah Faith. Mr. Castillo sent me to look after you. He said it's dangerous for you here, and he's worried about you."

I was surprised. Kathy immediately gave me a teasing look and said, "Worried? Dangerous? I told you Royce likes you."

I rolled my eyes at her and told her to stop talking nonsense. Then I turned to Savannah and said, "Wait a moment. I'll call him."

Savannah smiled and nodded.

I stepped aside, avoiding Kathy's teasing gaze, and called Royce.

"Did you send Savannah?"

Royce's deep voice responded, "I was worried about you, so I asked a friend to find Savannah to look after you. Don't worry, she's a retired special forces soldier and now works as a bodyguard. She's very reliable."

"Thank you," I said softly.

Royce chuckled. "When will you stop thanking me so much?"

I didn't know what to say. I turned to look at Kathy, who was making faces at me. I quickly hung up the phone.

"I have some things to take care of. I'll treat you to dinner another day."

When I returned, Kathy asked with a smile, "Is she from Royce?"

I rolled my eyes at her.

Kathy didn't mind. "Alright, with her here, I can rest easy. I'll head home now. Call me if you need anything."

I nodded and told her to drive safely. Then I watched her leave.

Savannah and I went inside. For some reason, I had complete trust in anyone Royce sent, as if I knew he would never harm me.

I prepared the room Holly used to stay in for Savannah. "You can stay here. Thank you for your help."

Savannah wasn't fussy at all. She looked around and said with a smile, "This is much better than my old barracks. Thank you, Ms. Sharp."

###chapter 96

I nodded, "Alright, you get some rest here. I'm gonna head to my room and lie down for a bit. Feeling kinda tired."

Once I got back to my room, I lay down on the soft bed, closed my eyes, and surprisingly fell into a deep sleep.

Who would've thought I'd dream of Elora again? This time, it wasn't the scene of her jumping off the building, but right before she jumped. I saw her standing at the edge of the rooftop, turning back to give me a gentle smile.

The image sent chills down my spine, and I woke up with a scream.

Just then, Savannah came in, looking at me with concern. "Ms. Sharp, are you okay?"

I shook my head wearily, "Just had a nightmare."

Savannah stayed by my side, comforting me. Her presence did make me feel a lot better. Then I asked, "Could you make me some porridge?"

I hadn't eaten all day, and I was starting to feel a bit hungry.

Savannah agreed without hesitation and went downstairs to the kitchen to make the porridge.

As I sat on the bed trying to calm down, I suddenly heard a loud sound of glass shattering.

I jumped in fright and screamed. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the window next to me had been broken by someone.

My cat was startled too and quickly ran away.

On the floor of my room lay a large rock. It seemed someone had thrown it to break my window.

Who would do such a thing? Was someone trying to get back at me?

Savannah heard the noise and rushed upstairs, seeing the broken glass.

She comforted me first, then immediately jumped out of the second-floor window to catch whoever had thrown the rock.

I watched her jump down, unsure if the shock from the broken glass or her jumping out the window was greater.

A moment later, she hurried back and shook her head at me. "Sorry, Ms. Sharp, I couldn't catch the person who broke the glass."

I shook my head, "It's alright. With all the negative attention online, it might be someone trying to get back at me."

"And please, don't jump out of the second-floor window again. It's really dangerous, and it scares me."

Savannah paused, scratching her head with a sheepish smile. "Sorry, Ms. Sharp, I'm just used to it."

I wondered where Royce had found someone with such a quirky yet endearing personality.

After finishing the porridge Savannah made, I stopped her from cleaning up. "Leave it. Come with me to the property management office."

Savannah didn't quite understand but followed me anyway.

We went to the property management office in the neighborhood.

The people in the office had mixed expressions when they saw me, knowing the commotion I'd caused recently.

I stood in the middle of the office and demanded, "Where's the manager? Get the manager out here!" I said calmly.

No one responded for a while. Eventually, a woman glanced at me and asked, "What do you need the manager for?"

I didn't even look at her. "You're not qualified to talk to me. Get the manager."

"You..." The woman glared at me angrily.

"Think you're all that because you have money? Stealing someone's child and driving them to jump off a building. The law will catch up with people like you eventually," she muttered.

Hearing this, I walked up to her, looking down at her. "Say that again."

The woman looked up at me defiantly. "What if I do? Am I not telling the truth?"

I smirked and nodded, then turned to Savannah. "Hand me your phone."

Savannah handed me her phone, and I dialed the police right in front of the woman.

"Hello, police? Someone is slandering me to my face. I'd like to report it."

The woman's face changed, clearly not expecting me to actually call the police.

"Yes, please come over," I said, glancing at the woman's name tag, which read Emma Kate.

"Yes, the person slandering me is named Emma. There are cameras in the office. Alright, I'll wait for you."

Emma was now completely panicked. She didn't know if what she said was true, but seeing my serious attitude about calling the police, she was visibly scared.

The people around, seeing that I had really called the police, started to get uneasy. Some of Emma's male colleagues, who had a crush on her, couldn't sit still. "Come on, you don't have to do this. She just said something offhand. Do you really need to call the police?"

"Can't you take a joke? You're really no fun."

I sneered at the man who spoke first. "Alright, then I'll say you have erectile dysfunction."

The man froze, his face turning red as he tried to defend himself. I smiled brightly. "Sorry, just kidding."

He stared at me, dumbfounded, while I continued coldly, "Now you know how it feels to be slandered. Was my joke funny to you?"

"I'll ask one more time, where is the manager?"

Sensing that I wasn't easy to deal with, one of the men quietly went upstairs and brought the property manager down.

The property manager was a bald, overweight man in his late 30s, with a noticeable beer belly.

He looked at me with an arrogant tone, "What's the matter?"

"How does your property management work? Someone broke into my house and smashed my window, and you didn't even know? No solution, no one came to find me. Are you even doing your job? Is my annual property fee just for you to sit around and do nothing?"

I looked at the property manager, not holding back.

The manager frowned, glaring at me. "Miss, you can't talk like that. Considering the things you've done, it's already pretty good that we didn't stop you."

I sneered, "What have I done? Emma just slandered me, and I've already called the police. Do you want to slander me too? Perfect, the police can take both of you away when they get here."

The manager looked at Emma, who was now teary-eyed and looking at him pitifully. "Manager, she really called the police."

"Miss, can't we talk this out? Why call the police?"

"Besides, we didn't know. What's wrong with saying a few words?"

I sneered, "You didn't watch our company's press conference? Didn't see the clarification? Are your eyes just for blinking, not seeing?"

"Miss, please speak respectfully. We serve the residents here. You should show some respect."

"Fine, then give me an explanation. Why was my window smashed? Why did you let a stranger in?"

The manager scoffed, "So many people come and go every day. How can we keep track?"

I looked at him, "Is this how you ensure the safety of the neighborhood? Is this how you serve us? Fine, that's what you said."

###chapter 97

I turned to Savannah and asked, "Did you get it all on video?"

Savannah nodded, "Yep, got everything."

Before we came here, I had already asked Savannah to record everything on her phone. I wanted to make sure we had evidence in case the property management tried to dodge responsibility.

Seeing us recording, the property manager freaked out and pointed at Savannah, "Delete that video! Delete it now!"

He moved towards Savannah, thinking he could easily intimidate her.

Savannah didn't even flinch. She just slipped her phone into her pocket.

The property manager then tried to snatch the phone from Savannah's pocket.

Savannah blocked him with her hand, and when he tried to get physical, she didn't hesitate. She flipped him over her shoulder, and he landed on the ground with a thud.

Afterwards, she looked at everyone and said, "Sorry, but he made the first move. I was just defending myself."

The property manager lay on the ground, groaning in pain.

I crouched down beside him, smirking, "Do you know why I live in this neighborhood?"

"It's because the developer is a friend of mine."

"I recorded everything you all said earlier. I'll be sending it to your company's headquarters. Is this how you treat residents?"

My words sent everyone into a panic.

A few people even came up to apologize, saying they didn't mean it.

Of course, I ignored them. I found a chair and sat down, waiting for the police to arrive.

The police showed up in less than half an hour. I pointed at Emma, "She was the one spreading rumors about me. I have video evidence."

Emma sat there, too scared to move. She never imagined that her casual remark would become evidence against her.

"I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!" she repeated, then knelt in front of me, begging, "I'm sorry, Ms. Sharp. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me!"

I looked at her, "What were you thinking when you spread those rumors about me?"

I handed the video evidence to the police, and they took Emma away.

At the same time, I sent the video to the property management company.

As expected, the company took the matter seriously. They were known for their excellent service, and they couldn't believe something like this had happened.

They quickly sent someone to mediate, apologize, and promised to fire everyone involved.

I had a reason for targeting the property management company.

The large-scale journalist incident a few days ago was no coincidence.

I didn't believe that the property management would let a group of journalists in without someone pulling the strings.

Given that the residents here were all prominent figures, even offending one of them would be a big deal. So, I was sure someone was behind this.

Since that was the case, I might as well replace everyone to prevent future incidents.

I went home and received a call from Brandon.

He excitedly said, "Honey, I'm planning a celebration party at the company tomorrow night to celebrate securing the overseas project."

"Can you come? Let's celebrate together. After all, you played a big part in this."

I didn't respond right away. My gut told me Brandon had an ulterior motive. Otherwise, he wouldn't risk being seen as someone who relied on his wife to get ahead. I didn't believe he would want me to attend a public event.

Sure enough, Brandon continued, "Can you call Joanna and the others and invite them too?"

I smirked. So that was his real motive-he wanted some people to show up and make the event look good.

"Sure, I'll call her. After all, this is the first big project my husband has secured. I'm so happy for you. We'll all come to celebrate."

Brandon didn't catch the sarcasm in my voice. He was overjoyed and showered me with sweet words.

I knew he was just putting on an act.

I made a face of disgust and glanced at Savannah.

Savannah smiled but said nothing.

For now, things had settled down. Although Elora and Jason's issues weren't resolved, I felt more at ease with Simon's help.

That evening, I called Kelly.

She was in the kids' room, playing with the three children. Holly was there too. Watching the kids play filled my heart with warmth.

No matter what happened, seeing my three children always made me feel at peace and happy.

"Mom, things are almost resolved here. Once everything's settled, I'll come back to be with you."

Kelly smiled, clearly pleased, "Alright!"

I added, "By the way, I'll be bringing another child with me. It's Brandon's sister's kid, Briar. She's a sweet girl, and I feel bad for her being alone during the holidays. I thought she could come and play with Brett and the others."

Kelly didn't mind at all and nodded, "The more, the merrier. One more kid won't make a difference."

I laughed at her expression, "Mom, watch your words. You used to be a teacher, remember?"

Kelly laughed too, "Isn't it true, though?"

After chatting with Kelly, I felt much better.

Since the room was temporarily uninhabitable due to the broken window, I didn't want to move back to the master bedroom. So, I asked Savannah to set up a guest room for me.

After a night in the guest room, I woke up the next morning and asked Savannah to go shopping with me for a dress.

I used to have many dresses, but after my illness, they all fit loosely.

We went to the shopping district and passed by a gym. I pointed at it, "That's where I met Brandon."

Memories flooded my mind. Back then, Brandon was just an ordinary fitness trainer, and I was drawn to his kindness.

Looking back now, maybe he had ulterior motives all along. After all, kindness wasn't in his nature-only malice.

Savannah and I went to a nearby boutique and picked out a dress. Savannah noticed I chose a white gown and asked if it was too plain.

I shook my head. Brandon wasn't worth dressing up for.

I put on the dress and went to a nearby salon to get my makeup done, preparing to attend Brandon's celebration party.

As for inviting Joanna, I had called her the night before, and she gladly agreed.

Since our meeting with Isadora, Joanna and I had become good friends.

That evening, I arrived at the venue on time, with Savannah following behind me. She was still in her black outfit, looking out of place.

But she didn't seem to notice or care, enjoying the food and drinks without a second thought about the other guests' stares.

###chapter 98

I glanced at Savannah's outfit and chuckled, "You really don't sweat the small stuff, huh?"

Savannah was in the middle of stuffing a piece of caviar baguette into her mouth. She seemed to find it unappetizing and frowned. Hearing me speak, she looked at me, puzzled.

"I thought the stylist prepared some clothes for you? If you don't like dresses, there are pantsuits too. Why didn't you change?"

She gave a goofy smile, "I know my role. I'm here to protect you today. Why bother with all that?"

I nodded, "If she doesn't want to change, I won't force her."

I led Savannah to a quiet corner. From a distance, no one would guess I was the hostess of this celebration party.

A few guests were scattered around the banquet hall, all early arrivals hoping to curry favor with Brandon.

Within minutes, Brandon strode in from outside, arms wide open, greeting the guests in the hall.

"Welcome, everyone, to our celebration party. Enjoy the food and drinks."

I couldn't help but smirk. Brandon had never been to any grand events before, and all he could manage was a simple "enjoy the food and drinks."

Brandon scanned the room and spotted me. He quickly walked over, "Hey, babe, how are you feeling?"

I smiled at him, "I'm good. You've really gone all out with the decorations today!"

Brandon looked quite pleased with himself, his confidence clearly boosted by the success of the overseas project.

"Of course! The assistants told me that a few city officials heard about this and decided to join the fun."

"Well, this project is pretty significant, so it's no surprise it caught their attention."

I smiled slightly at Brandon, "Then you better do a good job, babe. Don't let these officials down."

Brandon nodded and smiled, "Don't worry, babe. I won't let this opportunity slip through our fingers."

He then noticed Savannah behind me and was momentarily taken aback. Pointing at her, he asked, "Who's she?"

Savannah glanced at me, and I explained, "This is the bodyguard Kathy arranged for me. Remember I was attacked at home recently? I got a bit scared, so I asked her to come."

Brandon didn't seem surprised. He nodded at Savannah, "Alright."

"I haven't asked you yet, how are you feeling after the scare at home? Are you better now?"

Just a moment ago, he was acting all concerned, but he had forgotten about the incident at home. He really didn't even want to pretend anymore.

I nodded, "I'm fine now. The property management has already apologized."

"I've replaced all the staff there. The new ones won't let anyone in again."

Brandon's face remained expressionless when I mentioned the property management. I was certain he had nothing to do with it.

He stepped forward, patted my shoulder, and kissed my forehead, "Alright, babe, make yourself comfortable. I need to greet the guests."

I nodded and watched Brandon, dressed in a tailored suit, stride away.

His suit was from a high-end custom brand overseas.

I remembered when I first brought Brandon into the company, he didn't know the difference between custom suits and off-the-rack ones. He showed up in a baggy suit and got laughed at.

Brandon was furious with me back then, saying I didn't give him a heads-up about the dress code.

Since then, his wardrobe was filled with custom suits worth thousands of dollars, as if he never wanted to be laughed at again.

But no matter how well he dressed, he couldn't hide his small-town mentality.

I turned and suddenly saw Kathy walking in. She spotted me and walked over briskly, "Caroline."

I was surprised, "Brandon invited you too? I thought he didn't have a good impression of you."

Kathy shrugged, "Who knows."

"He told me he was worried you'd be bored alone, so he asked me to keep you company. I thought, for once, Brandon did something decent."

I shook my head, doubting his intentions. I couldn't believe Brandon would do something decent.

Soon, more guests started arriving. Brandon stood outside, greeting them. The constant congratulations and flattery were getting on my nerves.

Just then, a sharp female voice rang out, "Thank you all for coming to support my son."

Kathy and I looked over. Sure enough, it was Karen, dressed in a gown and draped in an expensive shawl.

Karen was determined to present herself as a lady of high society, but she forgot she had the hands of a laborer.

She moved around the hall, greeting everyone, eager to make sure everyone knew of Brandon's achievements.

Karen made her way to me, looked me up and down, and rolled her eyes, "Isn't today a happy occasion for Brandon? Why are you dressed so plainly? People might think the Jordan family can't afford new clothes."

I smiled but said nothing.

Kathy, standing beside me, retorted, "Why dress so flashy for a celebration? Are you looking for a new husband? Or a stepfather for Brandon?"

"You!" Karen glared at Kathy.

"Today is a good day. I won't argue with an ill-mannered girl like you."

"You're lucky Brandon invited you to this celebration. You should be grateful!"

Kathy rolled her eyes, "You think I wanted to come? I'm only here for Caroline."

Karen turned her gaze to me, muttering, "Always looking sickly, such a downer."

With that, she turned and walked away, not wanting to look at us any longer.

Kathy was about to say something, but I pulled her back, "Let it go. There's more drama to come today."

Kathy's interest was piqued, and she looked at me excitedly, "What drama?"

I said, "Just wait and see. Brandon's gone all out today. Knowing him, he's bound to do something over the top."

"But today's guests aren't the usual sycophants. Someone will definitely call him out."

Kathy nodded, half-understanding, her eyes full of curiosity.

Karen was still mingling, and Kathy's gaze followed her. Suddenly, she said, "Anyone who didn't know better would think Karen was some hostess trying to attract customers. Look at her, smiling like a blooming flower."

I looked over and chuckled, "You have to understand, people like her, who can't truly fit in, rely on these external things to make themselves look knowledgeable and sophisticated. But deep down, they're still a mess."

###chapter 99

As we were chatting, a few more people walked into the room. I recognized them right away.

Leading the group was Isadora, arm-in-arm with a man, leaning on him with a sweet smile on her face.

Noticing my curiosity, Kathy explained, "That's Isadora's husband, Marshall Banks."

I glanced at Marshall. He had a straight-laced look, with sharp, well-defined features. He seemed like the kind of guy who always followed the rules.

Kathy continued, "Marshall works at the police department. I hear he's pretty high up."

I was surprised and remembered the favor Isadora had asked Simon. "Then why didn't she ask Marshall to look into Celestia's case?"

"Because of the conflict of interest rule. Marshall can't investigate Celestia's case. Others have tried but haven't gotten anywhere, so she had to ask Simon."

I nodded, getting the picture now.

Isadora noticed me and pulled Marshall over.

"Ms. Sharp, Ms. Patel, this is my husband, Marshall. Marshall, these are my friends."

Isadora smiled warmly as she introduced us, a stark contrast to how she looked in the hospital room that day.

I felt a pang of sympathy. If Isadora hadn't gone through all this, they would have been such a happy family. But now, they were stuck in this mess.

Maybe it was his professional habit, but Marshall scanned Kathy and me before extending his hand and saying in a deep voice, "Hi, I'm Marshall."

Kathy and I shook his hand.

Kathy smiled and said, "Mr. Banks, you're really lucky to have married someone like Isadora."

At this, a barely noticeable smile appeared on Marshall's usually stern face, and he put his arm around Isadora.

He didn't say anything, but his body language spoke volumes. Isadora smiled shyly.

It was clear they were very much in love. After all, you can't fake body language.

Just then, a few more people approached, holding glasses of wine, wanting to drink with me.

Isadora's face turned cold when she saw one of them. She grabbed Marshall's arm.

Marshall gently patted her hand without saying a word.

Sensing something was off, I looked at the newcomers. The woman leading the group had a seductive figure and a frivolous expression.

Though it's not good to judge by appearances, I couldn't help but feel she wasn't a decent person.

Sure enough, Kathy whispered to me, "That's Alfonso's alleged mistress, Aurelia Kingsley."

She continued in a low voice, "They've been spotted vacationing abroad multiple times, but Alfonso has never admitted it."

"Publicly, Aurelia is the owner of several bars. But for her to be at tonight's event, it's hard to believe Alfonso didn't arrange it."

I turned my gaze to Aurelia. She raised her glass to toast me. "Ms. Sharp."

"I've heard about your early years. You really found yourself a good husband."

Her contradictory words made me want to laugh. On one hand, she praised my husband, and on the other, she admired my past. If she really knew me, she wouldn't say such things.

Thinking she was being flattering, Aurelia continued, "Your husband founded this company, which has now expanded overseas. He's the pride of our city."

"You're really fortunate."

I let out a cold laugh and looked at Aurelia. "You probably don't know that I founded this company, do you?"

Aurelia was stunned, looking at me in disbelief.

I shook my head and waved dismissively. "It's okay. Maybe your understanding is limited. You think only a man could achieve this."

Kathy stifled a laugh and asked, "Ms. Kingsley, did you also rely on a man to open your bars?"

Aurelia didn't respond, her face turning a bit sour.

She gritted her teeth and said, "You two are really funny. But if it weren't for Mr. Jordan, this company wouldn't be what it is today, right?"

At that moment, Joanna walked over and said, "Let me tell you the truth. If it weren't for Caroline's involvement, I wouldn't have given this project to Brandon."

I looked at Joanna, pleasantly surprised. "Why are you here so early? With your status, you should be the last to arrive!"

Joanna smiled lightly, putting her arm around my shoulder, her gaze drifting over Aurelia.

"I came early to see if anyone dared to offend you."

Aurelia's face stiffened at Joanna's words. Seeing Joanna's arm around me, her expression turned even more unpleasant. "Ms. Thorne, hello."

She extended her hand to Joanna, who merely glanced at it before turning back to talk to me, completely ignoring her.

Aurelia's hand hung in the air for a moment before she awkwardly lowered it. "Well, Ms. Thorne, I'll leave you to your conversation."

Kathy rolled her eyes. "Who cares where you go? No one here does."

Isadora glared at the departing Aurelia. I noticed they hadn't exchanged a single word. It seemed Aurelia knew she had ruined Celestia's marriage and wisely kept her mouth shut.

"Shameless," Isadora muttered. "I'll expose your affair with Alfonso sooner or later."

I patted her shoulder. "Take your time. People like her will get what's coming to them."

Isadora nodded in agreement. "My husband's colleague just arrived. I'll go greet him and come back to you later."

As Joanna joined us, Brandon eagerly approached, trying to cozy up to her. "Ms. Thorne, welcome to our celebration. Your presence truly honors us."

Joanna waved him off impatiently. "No need for formalities. I'm here for Caroline. We're good friends now."

Brandon's smile froze, then he nodded and turned to me. "Honey, make sure to take good care of Ms. Thorne."

At that moment, Earl's assistant, Francis, hurried over to Brandon and whispered something in his ear.

Brandon's expression changed, then his smile grew wider. "Great, great, add a few more seats."

He turned to us. "Sorry, an important city official just arrived. I need to go greet them."

Brandon quickly headed to the entrance. Whoever it was must be significant for him to react this way. I looked over curiously.

But there were too many people at the door, and I couldn't see anything, so I gave up.

###chapter 100

The celebration banquet kicked off soon enough. I scanned the room and saw that the attendees were indeed big shots. It was clear Brandon had gone all out for this event.

Savannah, Kathy, and I stood in a corner, taking it all in.

Joanna had already been whisked away to mingle up front. We watched as Brandon worked the room, toasting left and right, his grin impossible to hide.

Kathy remarked, "Well, he's definitely made it."

Savannah glanced at Brandon and muttered, "Success built on others' efforts is ultimately hollow, isn't it?"

Her comment made Kathy and me burst into laughter. People who practice martial arts really do have a knack for cutting to the chase.

Meanwhile, Karen was busy schmoozing, seemingly bragging about Brandon's achievements. But everyone here was sharp; they all knew the real story behind their family.

Inwardly, they all looked down on Karen, thinking it was beneath them to even speak to her. But you couldn't deny that she had managed to climb the social ladder through marriage, and you had to respect that kind of luck.

Just then, a woman walked in through the door. She was elegant and poised, immediately drawing attention as if she were the hostess of the evening.

Brandon noticed her too and quickly went to greet her.

Kathy scoffed, "Brandon really has no shame, does he? He's not even trying to hide it anymore."

Curious, I asked, "Who is she?"

Kathy replied, "That's Maeve Harrington, a well-known mistress. She's been with quite a few wealthy men, all thanks to her looks and figure."

"She's also the lead dancer at the city's dance troupe, which is how she meets so many rich guys."

Kathy pointed around the room, "I bet a lot of her ex-lovers are here tonight."

I was taken aback, not really feeling anything but still puzzled about why Brandon invited her.

"Maybe he invited her to perform a dance later," Kathy guessed, seeing my confusion.

I nodded, still unsure, and continued to watch their interactions.

Brandon, clearly feeling triumphant, was now introducing Maeve to various bigwigs, his arm around her.

Kathy rolled her eyes, "Does Brandon not realize he might introduce her to one of her exes?"

Just then, Joanna came over and pulled me along, "You're the star of the show. What are you doing standing in the corner? Come with me, you should be at the center of the event."

I was reluctantly dragged to the middle, with Kathy and Savannah following behind.

Joanna pushed me next to Brandon and said coldly, "Mr. Jordan, why are you introducing a dancer instead of your wife at this banquet?"

The term "dancer" was highly derogatory, and Maeve's face immediately showed her discomfort. But given Joanna's status, she couldn't say anything and forced a smile.

Brandon was caught off guard but quickly recovered, saying, "My wife isn't feeling well, so I thought I'd introduce the performer for tonight, Maeve. She'll be dancing for us later."

Joanna, never one to hold back, shot back, "If it weren't for Caroline, my father wouldn't have agreed to give you the project. And yet, you don't even introduce her?"

Hearing this, the leaders around us turned to look at me.

Brandon gritted his teeth and forced a smile, "This is my wife, Caroline, the founder of this company."

Kathy chimed in, "Yeah, Caroline is the founder."

Brandon glared at Kathy but nodded reluctantly.

The leaders shook my hand, "We've heard a lot about your company's achievements in the building materials industry. It's impressive to meet the person behind it."

I smiled, "I had some help from my father, who was also in this industry."

The leaders nodded, understanding that few succeed without family support these days.

Joanna continued to praise me to the leaders, "Caroline's work is exceptional. She saved the company from the brink several times. It's only now that her husband is managing it. Back then, they were the industry leader."

The implication was clear: the company's decline was Brandon's fault, not mine.

Brandon's smile grew more strained as he understood Joanna's point.

I raised my glass and toasted the leaders, exchanging pleasantries.

Our group was lively and harmonious, while Brandon and Maeve were left out in the cold.

After a while, I suggested, "Let's not keep talking, the banquet is about to start."

Brandon seized the opportunity to step forward, "Alright, everyone, please take your seats. I'll say a few words and then join you."

He went on stage, pushing down his earlier feelings of being ignored, and put on a confident expression.

"Distinguished colleagues, leaders, and friends, welcome to our company's celebration banquet. We're here to celebrate securing an overseas project. Of course, my wife Caroline played a crucial role in this success."

Having learned his lesson, Brandon made sure to introduce me.

"Now, let's welcome Mr. Cox from our overseas partner to say a few words."

Louis came on stage with a translator and delivered his speech, followed by applause.

"Alright, I now declare the banquet officially started," Brandon announced.

Guests took their seats, and the stage transformed into a performance area where Maeve began her captivating dance, drawing many eyes.

I was seated at the main table, while Kathy and the others were nearby. I wanted to join them, but Kathy insisted, "You're the star tonight. You need to sit at the main table. We're fine where we are, and Isadora is with me."

Isadora nodded, "Yes, Ms. Sharp, you should be here."

Joanna also pulled me to sit at the main table.

Once the dishes were served, the banquet officially began.

###chapter 101

Brandon then invited one of the leaders to come up and say a few words. Judging by Brandon's overly eager expression, I could tell this was the top dog.

The leader didn't waste any time and stepped up to the stage. He started by talking about his hopes for the company's continued growth and success, and then he stressed the importance of supporting other businesses so everyone could move forward and profit together.

The room burst into applause. After all, what he said hit home for everyone-profit is the bottom line, and everything else is just noise.

But then, the leader pointed at me and said, "I just found out today that the founder of this company is a woman. I always thought it was Mr. Jordan. Since that's the case, why don't we have this lady come up and say a few words?"

"And in this overseas project collaboration, Ms. Sharp has been a crucial part. Without her, this collaboration wouldn't have happened. So let's hear what Ms. Sharp has to say!"

All eyes turned to me. I could confidently say that almost everyone in this city knew who I was after everything that had happened recently.

But now, I was about to step into the spotlight again.

Brandon's face darkened. This was supposed to be his moment, and if I went up, it would definitely steal his thunder.

Brandon looked at me with an unreadable expression.

He seemed to be hoping I would decline, showing weakness, and then he could smoothly take the stage himself. But he was wrong-I was not that kind of person.

I stood up and confidently walked to the stage.

Brandon's face turned completely grim.

I shared some stories about the company's journey over the years with the audience.

Soon, the room was filled with thunderous applause.

I had chosen to share some of the most interesting experiences I had gone through.

When I finished, I felt a bit dazed. I used to come up on this stage often, but I had never felt this way before. Now, I felt a long-lost excitement.

I was born for the business world.

Not for the small circle of a housewife.

I now realized how wrong my initial choice had been, but thankfully, there was still a chance to make things right.

I stepped down from the stage amidst the applause. Brandon gritted his teeth and said to me, "Honey, you did great up there."

I glanced to the side and saw Kathy, Joanna, and Isadora all giving me thumbs up, as if they were cheering me on.

I felt incredibly satisfied, like I had finally released all the pent-up frustration from these years in one go.

There were no more speeches after this, as the leader had already given the closing remarks. So, Brandon didn't get his moment in the spotlight after all.

Karen's face was equally displeased. This was supposed to be the Jordan family's moment to shine, but I had taken the stage instead.

She walked over to me, gritting her teeth. "What were you doing up there? This was Brandon's event. Don't you know to give him the opportunity? You don't understand anything."

I rolled my eyes. "The leader asked me to go up. Was I supposed to say no? If you have a problem, take it up with him."

Karen fell silent. She was the type to be tough at home but would never dare to offend anyone with power. She would only flatter others and belittle her own family.

I enjoyed the meal immensely, but the Jordan family was not happy, especially Brandon and Karen. They were in a foul mood, having missed their chance to shine.

After dinner, there were some performances to watch. The leader had left early, leaving just us businesspeople. That's when I unexpectedly saw Irene and Renee.

I was surprised because I hadn't seen them earlier. It was like they had just appeared out of nowhere.

I stood with Joanna, Isadora, and Kathy, looking at the two from a distance.

"Did you see them earlier?" Everyone shook their heads, indicating they hadn't.

I was puzzled. Where had they been hiding? How did they suddenly appear?

Just then, I saw Irene walking toward us. She didn't even glance at me but extended her hand to Joanna. "Ms. Thorne, I'm Irene."

Her eager expression made it clear she wanted to get to know Joanna.

Joanna and I exchanged a glance. She extended her hand and looked at Irene. "And you are?"

Irene's gaze fell on me. "Didn't Caroline introduce me? I'm her husband's aunt, Irene, and I'm also the company's CFO."

I patted Irene's shoulder. "Ms. Thorne, you should know that my aunt has been crucial to the company's success."

Since she wanted to play this game, I decided to flatter her a bit.

Sure enough, Irene was pleased with my words and nodded proudly.

She took out a business card and handed it to Joanna. "If you need anything, feel free to contact me."

It seemed she had gotten a taste of success and was now overconfident, thinking she had become Joanna's go-to person.

Joanna took the card with a smile.

After Irene left, I winked at Joanna. "That woman is so full of herself."

Joanna chuckled and casually tossed Irene's card into the trash.

After seeing Joanna and the others off, I finally noticed Paula.

I remembered that Paula was also an employee of the company and should have been at the celebration. I hadn't seen her earlier because she was probably handling some logistics. Now that the big shots had left, she had come out.

Paula didn't notice me and quietly walked away.

I had a gut feeling she was heading somewhere suspicious, so I followed her. To my surprise, Renee was following her too.

I was stunned. Something felt off. When did these two start hanging out together? I had to find out the truth, so I followed them without hesitation.

The event was held at a hotel, so after Paula left the venue, she entered the hotel lobby. I followed her, but she quickly disappeared.

I was startled and looked around, worried she had spotted me.

Thankfully, I soon realized I had just lost track of her. Ahead was the hotel's restaurant with private dining rooms. I decided to check each one, figuring she must be in one of them.

###chapter 102

I quietly moved forward, my feet sinking into the plush carpet.

Every room ahead had voices coming from it, so I had to listen at each door.

The first room had a woman's voice that I didn't recognize, so I moved on to the second room.

I continued this way until I reached the last room. Finally, I heard Renee's voice.

Her voice was distinctive, with a lazy rasp, so I recognized it immediately.

But the room was soundproofed too well; I couldn't make out what she was saying.

I could only vaguely sense that there were several people inside, and it sounded like they were arguing.

Gathering my courage, I tried to push the door open a crack to hear what they were saying.

Just then, a noise behind me startled me, and I bumped into the door heavily.

The people inside the room immediately became alert and looked outside warily, "Who's there?"

I was extremely nervous and had no idea what to do. There was nowhere to hide, and if they came out, they would definitely see me.

As I was thinking about what to do, a pair of hands suddenly reached out from the adjacent room and pulled me in. The person dragged me into another room and firmly shut the door.

The door to the adjacent room opened in response.

I heard Paula's voice loudly asking, "Who's there?"

It seemed I was right; Paula and Renee were together.

Above me, I heard Royce's voice. He said, "You have some nerve coming here alone. What if they did something to you?"

I could hear a hint of anger in Royce's voice. I looked up at him, slightly surprised, "What are you doing here?"

He replied irritably, "Your company invited me to this event, but I had other plans. I found out I was meeting someone at the same hotel."

"I just saw my guest off and was sitting here to rest when I saw you sneaking around."

Feeling a bit guilty since he had just saved me, I apologized softly, "I'm sorry."

Royce snorted, "Why are you apologizing to me? Can you be more careful next time? Do you even realize how dangerous your situation is? You're always so reckless."

His words made me feel a bit embarrassed.

Today, I had indeed been too impulsive. I was just curious why Paula and Renee were together.

Royce snorted again, "Couldn't you have brought someone with you? At least you could have had some cover. Or let someone they don't know check it out. Did you have to come yourself?"

I looked down, feeling like a student being scolded.

He looked down at me for a moment and snorted, "What would you have done if I hadn't been here today?"

I sincerely thanked him again.

"And you didn't even bring Savannah with you. If something happened, she could have helped you. You're too careless!"

I kicked the floor, knowing he was right, but still feeling defiant.

Finally, I couldn't hold back and retorted, "Am I a child? Can't I go anywhere?"

"Still talking back? Do you even know how dangerous it was just now?"

Of course, I knew, but I didn't want Royce to scold me.

Royce snorted and opened the door a crack, listening to the sounds outside.

It was quiet now; the people next door had gone back inside, seemingly unable to find anyone.

I followed Royce's gaze outside and asked, "Is anyone there?"

Royce shook his head, "Nope, no one."

I was itching to go back and listen again, but Royce saw right through me. "You still wanna go?"

He frowned and glared at me.

That rebellious streak in me surged up. "What's wrong with checking? What if they're discussing something important? It could be a crucial clue."

Ignoring him, I headed for the door, feeling a bit defiant. Ten years ago, you left without a word. What right do you have to control me now?

Just as I reached the door, he grabbed me and pulled me into his arms, holding me tight. I was stunned, my nose pressed against his chest, catching a faint scent of bamboo ink. He whispered, "There's movement outside. Don't make a sound."

Startled, I listened carefully. Sure enough, the door to the adjacent room seemed to open, and someone was walking out. They must have finished their discussion.

I glared at Royce's chin and said, "It's all your fault. Now I didn't hear anything."

He didn't seem to mind my little outburst and continued listening to the sounds outside.

All I could hear was the rustling of his clothes, unable to make out the sounds outside. I had to wait for Royce to give me feedback.

"Have they left?" I asked softly.

Royce, holding me, shook his head, "Not yet. Wait a bit longer."

I was puzzled. What were they doing outside? Had they discovered Royce and me in this room? I became very nervous and scared, not daring to move.

What I said earlier was just out of anger. I didn't really dare to go out and check. Renee seemed dangerous, and there were many men in that room. If they found me, I couldn't imagine what would happen.

I held my breath for a long time, finally unable to resist, "Have they left yet?"

Royce shook his head again. I was even more confused. Why hadn't they left? Were they just standing outside?

I gently pushed Royce away and walked to the door. There was a peephole, and I looked outside. The hallway was empty.

I realized Royce had been lying to me. I turned and glared at him, "Why did you lie to me?"

Royce couldn't help but chuckle, tilting his head to look at me, "What do you think?"

He was wearing a black suit today, which fit him perfectly, making him look both restrained and sexy.

I had to admit, Royce looked really good in a suit, much better than Brandon.

I cleared my throat, feeling a bit embarrassed.

"I'm leaving."

But Royce grabbed me again.

He said, "Call Savannah and have her pick you up. Don't go out alone."

Royce was thorough in his actions. I called Savannah, told her where I was, and then waited quietly. The room was now just me and Royce, and the atmosphere was a bit awkward.

Leaning against the door, I thought about the hug earlier, feeling confused about his intentions.

Unexpectedly, Royce suddenly stepped forward.

Startled, I shrank back, but he kept advancing, his tall frame standing in front of me, exuding a strong sense of pressure.

###chapter 103

I stood there, frozen, unsure of what to feel, staring blankly at Royce.

"What are you doing? Royce, what are you doing?"

My voice came out hoarse, but he stayed silent, his eyes locked on me as he moved closer.

Finally, he reached out a hand towards my face, and I instinctively closed my eyes.

I felt his cool fingers touch my forehead, gently brushing something aside. Then I heard his soft chuckle by my ear.

"What are you thinking? I was just moving your hair."

I opened my eyes to see Royce looking at me with a teasing expression, his eyes holding an emotion I couldn't decipher.

I quickly slapped his hand away. "I can do it myself."

I reached up to push back the strands of hair that had stuck to my forehead with sweat from my nervousness.

But just then, Royce moved in swiftly, startling me.

Before I could react, he leaned in and kissed the corner of my lips.

The cool, moist sensation left me stunned. I looked at Royce in disbelief.

He just smiled lightly and leaned in again.

His breath was warm on my face, making my heart race.

"I-I-I... you-you-you..." I stammered, unable to form a sentence.

His voice was hoarse too. "What?"

Just as he was about to kiss me again, there was a noise from the door behind us.

"Ms. Sharp, I'm here to pick you up. Are you inside?" Savannah called from outside.

The intimate atmosphere shattered instantly. I saw a flicker of frustration and annoyance in Royce's eyes.

He was about to say something, but I cut him off, shouting, "Yes, yes, I'm coming out right now."

Afraid that Royce might continue his actions, I quickly opened the door and rushed out, not even glancing back at his reaction or expression.

Savannah looked at me curiously. "Ms. Sharp, who were you with? Why is your face so red?"

Feeling guilty, I shook my head. "No one, no one."

I told Savannah about the close call.

She frowned. "Ms. Sharp, if something like this happens again, you must call me. It's too dangerous. What if they had found you and I wasn't there?"

I nodded, thinking how similar Savannah and Royce were in their scolding.

"I know I was wrong. Luckily, no one was around, so I hid inside for a bit and wasn't discovered. Don't worry."

Savannah nodded. "Let's go back quickly before they come back and find us."

We returned to the hotel lobby, where the last few guests from the banquet were slowly leaving, chatting in the lobby.

Kathy was still there, waiting for me.

Joanna and Isadora had already left due to other commitments. Kathy stood by the front desk, watching the scene unfold.

I walked over and followed her gaze. "What are you looking at?"

Kathy pointed ahead. "Watching the mistress."

I then noticed Maeve, chatting animatedly with a few businessmen, laughing flirtatiously.

Kathy sneered. "Her reputation here is already ruined. Those men are probably just toying with her because she's still attractive."

Curious, I asked, "What did Maeve do to become so well-known?"

Kathy recounted the story in detail.

"Maeve was a small-time dancer who slept with the troupe leader to become the lead. After achieving her goal, she dumped him to meet more wealthy men."

Kathy continued with a mysterious smile. "She then hooked up with a rich old man, but his money was actually his wife's."

"The old man had lived quietly by his wife's side all his life, but he ruined it by getting involved with Maeve. His wife found out and publicly humiliated him."

"She then divorced him, and he lived miserably afterward, unable to adjust to a life without wealth, crying at his ex-wife's door every day."

I nodded in surprise, glancing at Maeve, who was still laughing and chatting.

"Honestly, if that happened to me, I'd never show my face in public again. It's too humiliating," I said, feeling a bit sorry for her.

Kathy scoffed. "That's because you have morals. Maeve doesn't."

Just then, Brandon emerged from inside, followed by a man in a suit, likely the hotel manager.

He didn't see me and walked towards Maeve.

Maeve stood beside Brandon, chatting openly, occasionally touching his shoulder.

Kathy crossed her arms. "He really isn't picky, is he? Any woman will do."

"Who knows? Maybe he's decided to take revenge on society after catching something nasty."

Kathy and I exchanged a knowing look and laughed.

Brandon didn't talk to Maeve for long before he had to leave.

Maeve noticed us and, to my surprise, walked over, lifting her dress slightly.

She wore a silver sequined mermaid gown, looking quite glamorous.

Compared to my simple white dress, she seemed more like the hostess of the evening.

###chapter 104

"Hey, Mrs. Jordan, where'd you disappear to just now?"

Maeve strolled over with a smile. "I've been wanting to chat with you. Your speech was amazing."

I glanced at her briefly. "Thanks. Your dance was pretty good too."

Kathy, standing nearby, could barely hide her disdain and rolled her eyes.

I signaled her to be more discreet.

Maeve seemed to catch Kathy's hostility and turned to her. "Did I do something to offend you, Ms. Patel? Why the attitude?"

Kathy sneered. "I just have a thing about moral cleanliness."

Maeve instantly got the hint, her face darkening slightly, but she didn't let it show. She turned to me. "Caroline, you're so lucky to have a husband like Brandon."

Her tone was overly familiar, and I couldn't help but let out a cold laugh.

Was she here to stake her claim or to provoke me?

I raised my voice. "Brandon, come over here."

In the next second, Brandon walked over and gently put his arm around my shoulder. "What's up, babe?"

I leaned my head against his arm, suppressing my disgust to play along. "Nothing, just that Ms. Harrington said I'm lucky to have a husband like you. I agree, so I called you over."

Brandon smiled knowingly and pinched my nose. "I'm the lucky one to have a wife like you."

Seeing our close relationship, Maeve's expression turned a bit sour. She walked over to Brandon and patted his shoulder. "Brandon was just saying how amazing you are, Caroline, and how proud he is of you."

I crossed my arms and looked at Maeve. "Ms. Harrington, respect is earned by oneself, not by their spouse."

Brandon didn't catch the underlying tension between us. He ruffled my hair and said, "There are a few more guests I need to see off. I'll be back soon."

I nodded and let him go.

As Brandon walked away, Maeve's gaze followed him, only to be blocked by Kathy.

"Ms. Harrington, you must rely on men a lot, don't you? Caroline is an outstanding person, not just an accessory to a man."

Maeve's expression didn't change, and she smiled. "But as far as I know, Brandon has been running the company these past few years."

Her words made it sound like she owned the company. I smiled slightly. "Ms. Harrington, you seem to know a lot about our company?"

Maeve waved her hand dismissively. "Not really, but Brandon has invited me over a few times. The company is doing so well, thanks to him."

"Is that so?"

My expression remained unchanged. "I didn't realize you were so interested in our family business. If you'd like, I can arrange a position for you at our company."

Maeve waved her hand again. "I wouldn't know what to do. I'd just mess things up."

Kathy crossed her arms and sneered. "At least you know you'd be a mess. So why are you meddling? Do you even know any inside information, or are you just talking nonsense?"

"Did you just take one look and decide the company is doing well?"

After Brandon saw off the guests, he came back to us and noticed the tense atmosphere. "Hey, what's going on here?"

I pointed at Maeve. "Ms. Harrington seems to have some thoughts about the company's operations. We were just discussing them."

Brandon looked at Maeve, puzzled. "What ideas could she have? She's just a dancer."

His dismissive tone made Maeve's face change.

Kathy covered her mouth and laughed. "Mr. Jordan, you're making Ms. Harrington uncomfortable. She was just talking so confidently."

"Talking about these things in front of the company's founder, Caroline, isn't that just embarrassing herself?" Kathy glanced at Maeve.

Maeve's polite smile was slipping. She nodded slightly. "Excuse me, I need to step away for a moment."

Kathy rolled her eyes. "She dares to provoke but has such poor mental resilience."

I smiled and pointed in Maeve's direction. "Her mental resilience isn't poor. She has other plans."

Kathy followed my gaze and saw Maeve sitting alone on a sofa with a drink.

Brandon noticed and frowned as he walked over to her.

Kathy looked at me in disbelief. "What's she trying to do?"

I said, "Just watch."

We saw Brandon try to take the drink from Maeve, but she dodged.

We couldn't hear their conversation, but their body language was clear.

Kathy laughed. "I'll do the voiceover."

She mimicked a male voice. "Maeve, what are you doing? Don't you know my wife is here?"

Savannah and I laughed at her spot-on impression.

Brandon reached out to take the drink from Maeve again.

Maeve said something to Brandon.

Kathy continued. "Why do you care? Just worry about your wife."

"I'll just drink myself to death here, and no one will care."

Brandon finally grabbed the drink from Maeve. "Can you stop this? I invited you here, not to cause a scene."

Maeve looked up at Brandon with teary eyes. "Are you rejecting me? Why don't you reject your dying wife?"

Kathy paused and looked at me. "Caroline, I didn't mean it. That's what Maeve said, not me."

I patted her shoulder, indicating I didn't mind.

I had to admit, Kathy's voiceover was spot on. It really seemed like their conversation.

Kathy continued. "What does Caroline have to do with this? I invited you here to dance, didn't I?"

"But your wife stole the spotlight. No one noticed me."

Brandon grew more impatient. "Maeve, you're drunk. Go home."

Maeve looked at Brandon. "Are you kicking me out? I came here just for you."

It seemed something had happened between them before. Otherwise, Maeve wouldn't talk like this.

Maybe Brandon had a soft spot for this. Seeing Maeve's words, his tone softened. "Go home first. I'll come find you later."

But Maeve wouldn't let it go and tried to hug Brandon.

Kathy commented. "This woman is desperate for a man."

###chapter 105

Brandon shot a wary glance our way. Once he saw I wasn't paying attention, he shoved Maeve onto the couch.

Kathy and I quickly turned our gazes back, having looked away earlier to avoid being noticed.

"Go home now. This is your last warning!" Brandon said coldly.

Maeve snatched her drink back and took a few more sips.

Kathy then turned to Savannah and said, "Find an excuse to get close to Maeve and slip this into her drink."

Savannah nodded, took the item from Kathy, and quietly approached Maeve.

She positioned herself in front of Maeve and said something to Brandon.

Brandon glanced at me and gave a small smile.

Maeve, not wanting to see this, turned her head away. At that moment, we saw Savannah discreetly drop the substance into Maeve's drink.

The whole maneuver was smooth and seamless, impossible for anyone to notice.

Savannah returned, and Kathy looked at her curiously. "What did you say to him?"

Savannah replied, "I asked Brandon when he was going home, on behalf of Ms. Sharp."

Kathy gave her a thumbs up. "Smart and brave. Well done."

She then smiled and said, "Now, let's sit back and watch the show."

I was curious too. "What did you give Maeve?"

Kathy winked. "You'll find out soon enough."

Brandon seemed to be giving up on convincing Maeve. He was always impatient with women.

Maeve, not wanting him to leave, grabbed Brandon's arm. They started to pull and tug at each other in the corner.

Brandon, always cautious, kept looking around, not wanting to make a scene.

Maeve kept talking to him, and despite his irritation, there was a hint of enjoyment in his eyes.

Kathy checked her watch. "The drug should kick in soon."

I was even more curious now, wondering what Kathy had given Maeve.

Suddenly, Maeve started undressing herself, her face flushed and looking overheated.

I realized what was happening and stared at Kathy in disbelief.

She nodded and smiled. "Yep, it's an aphrodisiac."

"Someone like her deserves this. Nothing else would suit her better!"

I asked, "Why do you carry something like that with you?"

Kathy gave a mysterious smile. "I had a feeling something might happen tonight, so I came prepared."

I couldn't help but give her a thumbs up. It was satisfying, in a way.

Brandon was stunned by Maeve's behavior. "What are you doing?"

Kathy pulled me and Savannah closer to watch the scene unfold.

As we approached, Brandon quickly distanced himself from Maeve. "Honey, I don't know what's wrong with her. She just started undressing herself. I didn't touch her."

I knew the truth but pretended to be confused. "She looks really uncomfortable. Maybe we should take her back to the hotel to rest."

Brandon, relieved that I wasn't suspicious, nodded quickly and called over a security guard. "Take her upstairs."

Maeve was almost down to her underwear, still calling out for Brandon.

A man came to help her, and she clung to him, feeling the coolness and comfort.

From our perspective, it looked like Maeve was all over the security guard.

The middle-aged man seemed thrilled by the unexpected encounter.

But Maeve wasn't satisfied with just clinging. She started kissing the guard, making the scene even more shocking.

Brandon's face twisted in disgust. He hated women who had been with other men, so I knew he would never touch Maeve again after this.

He called out to the guard, "Get this disgusting woman upstairs."

Maeve continued to cling to the guard, mumbling incoherently.

The hall was still full of people, all witnessing the scene, confused by Maeve's sudden behavior.

Kathy smiled at me. "By tomorrow, Maeve's reputation will be even worse."

"She won't be able to attract any wealthy men after this."

Maeve had only been able to find men because she slept with rich ones, moving down the ladder. But after tonight, no wealthy man would be interested in her.

It was getting late, and Brandon arranged for a car to take Kathy home.

He looked at me. "Honey, I have a bit more to do. Want to wait and go home with me?"

I shook my head and pointed to Savannah. "No, I'll go with Savannah. She hasn't been drinking."

Brandon nodded and left.

Savannah and I headed to the hotel entrance. She told me to wait while she got the car from the garage.

I nodded, not in a hurry, and watched the night scene outside.

The weather was nice, with a cool breeze and a hint of floral scent in the air.

Suddenly, a van pulled up, and several men got out.

Sensing something was wrong, I instinctively stepped back, but the men moved quickly, grabbing me.

A black bag was thrown over my head, and I was shoved into the van.

I realized I was being kidnapped.

I didn't struggle or scream, seeing the bulges at their waists, likely guns.

To stay safe, I let them push me into the van, which drove off to an unknown destination.

After a long, bumpy ride, they finally pulled me out, dragging me to the ground.

###chapter 106

The air was thick with dust, and it was clear this place had been abandoned for a long time.

I could hear water dripping nearby, hinting at some kind of flowing water close by.

Then, I heard the heavy clang of a large iron door slamming shut.

Suddenly, the black hood over my head was yanked off, and I found myself staring at a stranger.

A scar ran across his face, giving him a particularly menacing look. His triangular eyes glared at me. "You better behave. Tell your husband to bring the money. Without $10 million, there's no way I'm letting you go."

His glare made me think he was kidnapping me for money, but my gut told me otherwise.

For some reason, I felt this group had a different motive for kidnapping me.

I nodded, trying to stay calm, and looked at the scar-faced man. "Can you let me call my husband? I'll ask him for the money."

He snorted. "What if you call the cops? What if your husband calls the cops? We'll contact you when we're ready."

With that, he left, leaving me alone in what looked like an abandoned factory.

I calmly observed my surroundings, looking for any possible escape routes.

Unfortunately, all the windows were boarded up, letting in very little light.

There were quite a few of them, and I wasn't sure if anyone was guarding the outside. If I tried to escape and they shot me, I wouldn't stand a chance.

My top priority was to stay safe and not act impulsively.

They definitely had another reason for holding me, so I waited to see what their real motive was.

My hands and feet were tied by the man before he left, so I could only sit on the ground.

My phone was still in my pocket, so he clearly wasn't just kidnapping me for money, or he would have taken it. But I couldn't reach it.

I could only hope Savannah would notice I was missing soon and call the police to rescue me.

Leaning against the cold wall, I inhaled the dusty air and slowly drifted off to sleep. It was a restless sleep, filled with chaotic dreams.

When I opened my eyes, I was still in the abandoned factory.

I had hoped it was all a dream, but reality hit me hard-I had really been kidnapped.

I didn't know how much time had passed, but it seemed like daylight was breaking, with light seeping through the boarded windows.

Just then, the iron door opened again, and the man from last night walked in, carrying something.

He tossed a sandwich and a bottle of water at me. "Eat!"

I didn't hesitate and started eating. I hadn't had a proper meal last night and was starving.

So, I didn't care what it was; I needed to keep my strength up.

The man watched me eat and laughed. "I thought you were tough. Turns out you're just like anyone else, eating whatever you're given after being kidnapped."

I didn't respond and quickly devoured the sandwich.

I drank some water to wash it down.

The man left without saying anything else.

I took a deep breath, trying to figure out who he was.

I suddenly remembered something Asher had told me about what happened after he was kicked out of the company. Could these people be working for Renee, planning to sell my organs in Southeast Asia?

Or were they someone else entirely? I had no idea what their real motive was.

Another day passed, and no one came to find me.

I knew Savannah had probably realized I was missing and reported it to the police, but finding me here would be difficult.

I found a brick nearby and used it to wear down the rope around my wrists, eventually freeing my hands.

I took out my phone, hoping to call Savannah, but there was no signal.

They must have used some kind of signal jammer around here.

I hid my phone again and loosely tied the rope around my hands, so they wouldn't notice when they brought me food.

Just as I finished, the man came in again.

He only showed up twice a day to bring me food, so why was he here now? I had a bad feeling.

I backed away cautiously. "What do you want?"

He came forward and put the black hood over my head again, trying to drag me away.

I panicked, sensing something was wrong, and tried to pull back, but he grabbed my hand.

The rope fell to the ground due to my sudden movement.

Seeing this, the man realized what I had been doing and his tone turned sinister. "You were trying to escape, weren't you? Didn't I tell you not to move?"

I couldn't explain. He hit me on the head, making me dizzy.

He violently grabbed my hand and dragged me out.

I had no strength to resist and was pulled out of the factory.

As soon as we stepped outside, I heard police sirens. I realized he had noticed the police coming and was trying to move me.

I struggled desperately, trying to buy time.

The man noticed my intention and threatened, "If you keep struggling, I'll kill you right here."

I stopped moving, but my mind was racing, trying to think of a way to delay him. Fortunately, the police arrived quickly. Before I could come up with a plan, they were already there, telling the man, "Let her go."

The hood was removed from my head, and the man used me as a shield against the police.

He laughed. "You want me to let her go? No way. She's coming with me to the grave."

I had no way to fight back.

Then I saw Simon and Royce getting out of the police car, with Savannah following them.

I didn't have time to be surprised that they knew each other. I stood still because I felt a gun pressed against my waist.

I trembled and said, "Let me go, and I'll give you all my money!"

"Who wants your money? I want your life!"

I realized then that this wasn't just a simple kidnapping. Someone was behind this.

###chapter 107

Royce looked at me, worry etched on his face. "Caroline, you alright?"

I gave a slight shake of my head.

Behind him, Savannah pointed at the guy next to me. "Let Ms. Sharp go, or you'll regret it."

In front of them, a bunch of cops stood ready, guns drawn, looking like they were ready to take down the guy holding me hostage any second now.

The guy, though, didn't seem bothered. He had one arm wrapped around me tight and a gun pressed to my waist with the other. "Anyone gets closer, and I'll shoot her."

The situation was tense, and no one dared to move.

I took a deep breath.

I wasn't ready to die like this. I had too much left to do. I hadn't avenged Brandon and the Jordan family yet, and I had three kids to think about.

"Who sent you? Whatever they're paying you, I'll double it. I'll make sure your family is taken care of for life."

Given the circumstances, the guy would end up in prison even if he survived, so I chose my words carefully, aiming for his weak spot.

But I underestimated how ruthless these guys could be. He sneered, "My family's dead!"

My heart sank. "Isn't there anyone you care about? I can help you, just let me go!"

"If you die today, what happens to the people you care about? Don't you have a wife and kids?"

Sure enough, his grip loosened a bit at my words. I must've hit a nerve.

I kept going, "If you go to prison today but let me go, I'll make sure your kid goes to the best schools. I'll cover all the expenses."

"I won't let him know he had a father like you. I'll make sure he lives a happy and fulfilling life."

This clearly got to him. The gun in his hand lowered a bit.

He must've thought of his kid, feeling a pang of emotion.

Seeing that this was working, I pressed on. "Whoever sent you here has already abandoned you. There's no one here to back you up. Are you really gonna keep risking your life for them?"

"When you get out, you can reunite with your family. By then, your kid will have graduated from college. Don't you want to live a normal life?"

The gun in his hand wavered again, but he said, "I've already gone too far down this path. There's no turning back for me."

"No, if you let me go now, there's still hope. You can still turn things around. If you reveal who sent you, I promise I'll plead for leniency on your behalf."

Just then, a gunshot rang out from behind.

I felt the guy behind me go limp and heard a heavy thud as he hit the ground, his gun dropping beside him.

Startled, I turned to see the guy had been shot by someone and was now dead on the ground.

At that moment, Royce shouted, "Get down!"

Before I could react, he tackled me to the ground, and a bullet whizzed past us, slicing through the air.

I hadn't fully processed what was happening, but Royce, who was now on top of me, was already sweating and breathing heavily.

"What just happened?"

Royce held me tightly. "His accomplice took him out."

I was in shock, realizing that Royce had tackled me because the other person intended to kill me too.

The police quickly sprang into action, rushing to search the hillside for the shooter. This had escalated into a major criminal case, with armed suspects killing right in front of the police.

I stood up and looked at the man behind me. "He was starting to have second thoughts, but he still got..."

Royce pulled me away and glanced at the man on the ground. "He doesn't deserve any sympathy."

I understood what Royce meant, but I continued, "I just feel sorry for his family, having a father and husband like that."

"I want to help his kid with school expenses. Can you help me find his child?"

Royce hesitated for a moment before nodding.

He led me to a nearby police car. Savannah, seeing that I was safe, breathed a sigh of relief. "I'm sorry, Ms. Sharp. I failed to protect you."

I shook my head. "It's not your fault. Even if it wasn't here, they would have found another way to kidnap me. That was their goal."

Despite my words, Savannah still frowned, looking deeply guilty.

I knew this wasn't the place to talk, so I got into the police car.

Inside, Simon was sitting in the front passenger seat, chatting with a police officer. He turned and grinned at me. "How does it feel to be kidnapped?"

Royce, sitting next to me, glared at him. "Can you shut up for once?"

I could feel Royce's tension. His hand gripped my shoulder tightly, making me wince. "It hurts a bit. Can you loosen your grip?"

He immediately let go. "Sorry, are you hurt anywhere?"

I shook my head. "The man didn't do anything to me. He even made sure I had meals on time."

Royce relaxed a bit at that. Simon laughed. "You have no idea how much he worried about you these past few days. None of us got any sleep."

I was taken aback. He had just casually revealed his identity.

"You..."

He smiled at me. "You already knew, didn't you?"

I nodded. I had suspected his identity for a while, but now it was confirmed.

Simon continued, "We suspected the Jordan family was connected to a major drug cartel. Then Royce asked me to help you. I thought it was a good opportunity to investigate the Jordan family and see if you were involved."

I looked at Royce. "How did you know about my situation?"

Royce hesitated before speaking. "I didn't know at first. Kathy noticed something and told me."

"I was abroad at the time and couldn't come back, so I asked Simon to help."

Seeing how familiar they were with each other, I couldn't help but ask, "What's your relationship? How do you know each other?"

They seemed like two completely unrelated people, yet here they were, working together.

Simon gave a mysterious smile. "Guess."

Royce shot him a look, and Simon's expression turned serious. "In short, his uncle is my dad. We're related by blood."

I was stunned, looking at the two of them in disbelief.

Now that I looked closely, I could see the resemblance in their features, though I had never noticed it before.

###chapter 108

I glanced at Simon and Royce and said, "No wonder you two look kinda alike."

Right after I said that, everything started to get fuzzy. I saw Simon's mouth moving, but I couldn't hear a thing.

A bit dazed, I asked, "What did you say?"

Simon seemed to repeat himself, but a shadow passed before my eyes, and my consciousness slowly faded until I collapsed into a warm embrace.

When I opened my eyes again, I was in a hospital room, the smell of disinfectant filling my nose.

I looked around and saw Royce leaning on the side of my bed, seemingly asleep.

I tried to move my hand but found it was held tightly in Royce's grip.

As soon as I moved slightly, Royce woke up immediately. He looked at me with a gentle tone, "You're awake?"

I nodded and asked, "What happened to me?"

Royce's eyes showed a hint of surprise, then he understood what I meant.

"You've been out for more than a day."

I stared in shock. I had slept for that long? When I was rescued, I felt like I could hold on, but I didn't know why I passed out in the car.

Royce seemed to read my mind and patiently explained, "When you were kidnapped, you were super stressed, and your body isn't in great shape. So, even though you didn't faint at the time, once we got you into the police car and you relaxed, you passed out."

"And your body hasn't fully recovered. Plus, you've only been eating sandwiches these past few days, so you haven't been getting enough nutrition."

I nodded. No wonder I felt so alert at the time; I thought it was because I was getting better. Turns out it was just fear keeping me focused.

I suddenly remembered the time Royce mentioned and was startled. I quickly asked, "Won't Brandon notice you're here?"

A strange emotion flashed in Royce's eyes. "You don't want me here?"

I shook my head. "It's just that your current situation isn't suitable for appearing in front of Brandon."

This explanation seemed to satisfy Royce. He snorted lightly.

"Brandon came by for a bit this morning. He cried his eyes out next to you, then went to work, leaving me here to watch over you."

As he spoke, his tone turned a bit aggrieved. "You don't even ask if I've eaten, just worry about Brandon."

He was throwing a tantrum. But Brandon is my husband; who else should I be concerned about?

Should I worry about Royce, who seems to have nothing to do with me?

Of course, I didn't dare say that out loud because I knew if I did, Royce would throw an even bigger fit.

I cleared my throat. "Have you eaten?"

Royce turned his face away, looking at the sunlight outside the window.

His profile was as finely chiseled as a sculpture.

"No!"

I looked at his sulking face and couldn't help but smile. He suddenly reminded me of Brett.

Royce turned back, looking at me strangely. "What are you smiling at?"

I pressed my lips together. "You look just like my son, Brett, when you act like this."

Royce squinted his eyes, his tone turning dangerous. "Say that again."

Seeing his expression, I knew better than to repeat myself.

I turned my head. "I'm hungry."

Royce continued, "Say it again. Who do I look like?"

I never expected him to be so childish.

I looked at him. "Don't you think so?"

"Only my son would care about such trivial things."

Royce gritted his teeth, looking at me. "Caroline, you're just trying to annoy me."

I stuck out my tongue, feeling a sense of relief after the ordeal. "I'm hungry."

Royce reached for an apple. "Have an apple first. Simon and Kathy are outside. I'll ask them to bring you something to eat."

It was then that I realized I hadn't seen Savannah.

"Where's Savannah?"

Royce snorted, a hint of coldness in his eyes. "She failed to protect you this time. I'm planning to replace her."

I was stunned and immediately widened my eyes. "No, no, I really like Savannah. Don't replace her."

Royce looked at me. "But I assigned her to protect you, and this happened right under her nose!"

He didn't seem to be joking, so I quickly said, "Even if you had a special forces team protecting me, I would still have been kidnapped in that situation. She was alone. Why blame her?"

"If you want to blame someone, blame the kidnappers. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't be in this situation. It has nothing to do with Savannah."

Seeing Royce unmoved, I continued, "If you have to blame someone, blame me. I insisted Savannah go get the car alone. It's all my fault!"

Royce silently handed me the apple, not saying a word.

I frowned. "If you don't let Savannah come back, I won't eat this apple!"

Royce sighed helplessly. "Fine."

His tone was heavy. I asked him what he meant.

Royce looked at me, his eyes filled with helplessness. "I'll let Savannah come back, but she has to face some consequences first."

I finally breathed a sigh of relief. At least Savannah could come back. As for the consequences, I could talk to Royce about that later.

I took the apple from Royce. He pulled out his phone and called Simon and Kathy, asking them to bring some food.

Soon, Simon and Kathy returned to the room. Kathy rushed over and hugged me as soon as she saw I was awake.

"You scared me to death these past few days. Do you know that?"

I patted Kathy's shoulder. "It's okay. I'm fine, aren't I?"

I felt her body trembling slightly. I realized Kathy was crying.

I patiently comforted her. "It's okay, really. I'm fine. Don't cry. I'm in one piece. You're making it seem like I was seriously injured."

Simon placed a bag of food on the table and laughed as he watched us. "I can't tell who was kidnapped. Why is Caroline comforting Kathy?"

###chapter 109

Kathy wiped her tears and glared at Simon.

Then she turned to me and said, "Good thing you're okay. With your health, even a small injury could take forever to heal."

I couldn't help but laugh. "It's not that bad. See? I'm fine."

Royce frowned at me. "Is Kathy wrong? You're an adult. Don't you know how to take care of yourself?"

I pouted at Kathy.

Kathy chuckled at my expression. "You have no idea how worried Royce has been about you these past few days. He stayed by your bedside the whole time, didn't go anywhere. You didn't eat for days, and neither did he."

I glanced at Royce, who avoided my gaze and stood by the window, silent.

I didn't know what to feel, so I asked Simon to set the table and invited Royce to join us for dinner.

At the table, we talked about my kidnapping.

I asked, "Did you catch anyone else besides the guy who grabbed me?"

"There were more than one person involved. I remember at least four or five people around me when I was shoved into that van."

Simon shook his head, looking serious. "No, the suspects were very cunning. They seemed to have gotten wind of our plans and escaped early, leaving that one guy to take the fall."

"We're trying to find traces in the area, but it rained heavily a couple of days ago, so it's going to be tough."

I nodded and voiced my suspicion. "I think my kidnapping might have something to do with Renee."

Everyone looked at me, and Simon asked, "What makes you say that?"

I replied, "The guy kept saying he kidnapped me for ransom, demanding Brandon pay up. But does Brandon even know about this? If he did, with his dramatic personality, he would have been right there with the police to rescue me."

"So, the ransom story is probably a lie. If they didn't kidnap me for money, what was their motive? Remember when Asher was kidnapped?"

"Asher said he was taken by a group planning to sell his organs at the border. I suspect they had the same plan for me. But I don't know why they kept me in that abandoned factory for two days."

My theory left everyone in silence.

Without evidence, it was just a theory. The key was to find the kidnappers and get them to talk.

But that was easier said than done.

I felt like we were fighting an invisible hand, always one step ahead, controlling everything from the shadows. The sense of powerlessness was overwhelming.

We had to take it one step at a time. Overthinking wouldn't get us anywhere.

I suddenly remembered Jason and looked at Simon. "Any news about Jason?"

Simon shook his head. "No, we still don't know where they're hiding him. We've ramped up surveillance on Shirley, but she hasn't made any moves."

I sighed, recalling a dream I had while I was unconscious.

In the dream, Jason was calling out to me. We were in a thick fog, and I could only hear his voice, guiding me. But the fog never cleared, and I couldn't see him.

I felt like he was waiting for me to save him.

"Shirley and Paula must know something. We need to find a way to get them to talk."

Simon and the others nodded in agreement. "You're right."

After dinner, Kathy suddenly pulled Simon to leave. Before they left, she winked and said, "Royce has been really worried about you. We'll give you two some alone time. Brandon will be back from work soon, and you won't have any time then."

I reached out to stop them, but Simon and Kathy were already out the door, leaving me alone with Royce.

I gave Royce an awkward smile. Why did it always end up like this? Just the two of us alone. It made me anxious.

I forced a smile. "Did you get enough to eat?"

Royce looked at me with deep eyes and nodded. "Did you?"

"Yeah, I'm full."

The room fell into silence. Neither of us knew what to say.

After all, we had a ten-year gap between us. No amount of talking could bridge that gap.

"Um," I finally broke the silence, feeling conflicted. "Thank you for everything."

Royce leaned against the window, chuckling softly. "When will you stop thanking me?"

I held my breath, my heart racing, making me restless.

"Thanks are in order when they're due."

He laughed and walked closer.

I felt a sudden tension, gripping the blanket. "What are you doing?"

Royce smiled. "Why are you so nervous?"

I clutched the blanket tighter, retreating a bit.

But Royce kept advancing.

Until he was right in front of me, like that time in the private room. I closed my eyes, tense.

The touch I expected didn't come.

I opened my eyes to see Royce smiling at me.

He asked softly, "Why did you close your eyes?"

I felt embarrassed. I was a mother of three, yet I still made such a blunder.

I couldn't help but feel annoyed. "Royce, can you stop teasing me?"

Royce laughed but said nothing.

I glared at him, but he suddenly leaned in.

Before I could react, he kissed me.

In that moment, I could hear my own breathing and heartbeat.

Thankfully, Royce didn't do anything more, just a brief kiss.

But my heart was already in chaos. "What are you doing? Why did you do that?"

Royce chuckled. "You closed your eyes. If I didn't meet your expectations, wouldn't you be disappointed?"

"So, I was just fulfilling your wish."

###chapter 110

Royce's ridiculous argument made me laugh out of sheer frustration.

"I didn't ask you to kiss me!"

Royce chuckled. "Oh really? Then why'd you close your eyes?"

I was momentarily speechless and glared at him.

Before I knew it, he was leaning in again. I tried to push him away with all my might, but he grabbed my wrists.

Just then, there was a knock on the door. "Ms. Sharp, are you okay?"

It was Savannah's voice. I breathed a sigh of relief and called out, "Savannah, come in!"

Royce straightened up, looking a bit annoyed.

Savannah walked in, oblivious to the tension, and came to my bedside. "I'm so sorry, Ms. Sharp. This is all my fault. You shouldn't have had to go through this."

I quickly patted her hand. "It's not your fault, Savannah. This has nothing to do with you."

"No matter who was protecting me that day, I would have been taken. They were prepared, and we couldn't have stopped them. So don't blame yourself!"

Seeing the guilt still lingering in Savannah's eyes, I spread my arms to show her I was fine. "Look, I'm okay!"

Savannah nodded, then turned to Royce, her voice low. "Mr. Castillo, it was my failure."

Judging by her demeanor, she must have gotten quite the scolding from him. Royce gave a barely perceptible nod and said coldly, "There won't be a next time."

Savannah quickly nodded.

The awkward atmosphere was broken, and I felt a bit more at ease, though Royce didn't seem pleased.

He stayed for a moment longer before saying, "I'll be going now. Call me if you need anything."

After Royce left, I let out a long breath and grabbed Savannah's hand. "Thank goodness you saved me."

Savannah looked puzzled. "Saved you from what, Ms. Sharp?"

I waved it off. "Never mind."

"By the way, where were you just now?"

Savannah scratched her head, looking a bit embarrassed. "I felt so guilty about you getting kidnapped that I went to accept my punishment."

Seeing her guilt, I comforted her for a while longer.

Finding someone who fits my needs and whom I like is rare, and Savannah is just that person. I really don't want to lose her.

Just then, Simon and Kathy walked in.

Kathy looked around the room. "Brandon's not here? I thought he would be. Royce messaged us saying he was leaving and asked us to come keep you company."

I felt a warmth in my heart. Royce really was considerate. "He probably had something urgent to attend to."

Simon sat in the chair next to me, Kathy sat on my bed, and Savannah stood nearby.

This scene made me feel incredibly at ease.

We chatted for a while, but soon, our peace was interrupted by an unexpected visitor.

Brandon burst into the room, looking frantic. "Honey, are you okay?"

His tone was so anxious that if I didn't know better, I might have thought he really cared.

Kathy rolled her eyes.

Simon gave me a look and quietly slipped out of the room.

Brandon sat on my bed, holding my hands. "Honey, you have no idea how worried I was. Are you okay?"

I shook my head. "I'm fine now."

"That's good, that's good."

Then he stood up and pointed at Savannah. "How could you let this happen? How could you not protect my wife and let her get kidnapped by those thugs?"

"If you can't do your job, then get out. I don't need you around my wife!"

How ridiculous, blaming the person who tried to protect me.

Savannah frowned, feeling guilty and unable to argue with Brandon.

But Kathy wasn't having it. "You're blaming Savannah? What were you doing as my husband? What right do you have to criticize Savannah?"

Brandon was taken aback. "I was attending to guests! I have my own responsibilities, don't I? Isn't she the bodyguard?"

Kathy snorted. "Well, Savannah was driving at the time."

Seeing Brandon about to retort, I cleared my throat. "Enough. This isn't Savannah's fault. Blame the kidnappers."

"I've already given the police detailed information. Now it's up to them to catch those who took me."

I looked at Brandon. "And Savannah did a great job. Don't say anything against her."

Brandon, seeing I had spoken, reluctantly nodded.

"Let this be the last time!" It was funny how both Brandon and Royce said the same thing, but Royce out of concern for me, and Brandon to make things difficult for Savannah and try to get her away from me.

Brandon stayed for barely two minutes before standing up. "Rest well, honey. I'll be going now."

After Brandon left, Kathy rolled her eyes. "He was here for all of two minutes, acting all concerned. What a joke."

I couldn't help but laugh.

When it comes to putting on a show, no one does it better than Brandon.

Kathy stayed for a while longer before I sent her off. "If you have things to do, go ahead. Savannah can stay with me. Nothing will happen."

Kathy had something urgent, so she nodded. "Call me if you need anything. I'll come right over."

After Kathy left, Savannah and I had dinner together.

I was planning to go to bed early, but just before I did, I got a call from someone unexpected.

It was Paula.

I stared at the phone, a bit surprised.

After a few seconds, I answered.

Paula's voice was small. "Mrs. Jordan, do you have a moment?"

I frowned. "What is it?"

Paula took a deep breath. "Mrs. Jordan, I need to tell you something very important. It's best if we talk in person."

I exchanged a glance with Savannah and replied coldly, "If you have something to say, say it over the phone. I don't have time to meet you."

After that party, I saw her leave with Renee.

So I don't trust Paula at all. What if she tries to kidnap me again?

Sensing my hostility, Paula quickly said, "Mrs. Jordan, you've got it wrong. I don't mean you any harm. I know you just got back, but this is really important. It's about Jason."

###chapter 111

"Jason?"

I was a bit taken aback. "Do you know where Shirley is hiding Jason?"

Paula kept pleading with me. "Mrs. Jordan, we really need to talk about this in person."

Seeing her so desperate, I had no choice but to nod in agreement and set a time to meet.

Finding Jason was just as important now. The dream I had that day left me uneasy, making me feel that if I didn't find Jason soon, something bad might happen.

So I had to find him as quickly as possible. Any clue, no matter how small, I had to investigate.

After hanging up the phone, Savannah looked at me. "Mrs. Jordan, do you think she might be up to no good?"

I shook my head. "I don't know."

So far, I couldn't see through Paula. I didn't know what she was really thinking.

So I didn't dare trust her or believe what she said.

As for what she said about Jason, I had to meet her in person to find out if it was true.

Savannah nodded. "Don't worry, Ms. Sharp. I'll go with you. This time, I won't let you get hurt again."

I smiled at Savannah. "I feel much safer with you around."

After staying in the hospital for two days, Savannah and I went to the café where I had arranged to meet Paula.

To be safe, I didn't let Savannah show up first. Instead, she sat in a booth behind us, ready to step in if there was any danger.

So from Paula's perspective, it looked like I was sitting alone.

She walked over and said, "Mrs. Jordan, you're here."

I nodded and took off my sunglasses. "Say what you need to say quickly. I need to know if it's worth my time to stay and listen."

Paula glanced at me and said, "Mrs. Jordan, Jason is missing..."

I slammed the table and stood up, glaring at Paula. "What do you mean by missing? Didn't you say he was with Shirley?"

Paula's expression became evasive. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Jordan. This is all my fault. It's all my fault."

She didn't explain the situation but started apologizing, which made me even more anxious.

I noticed people around us were starting to look our way. This wasn't the place to talk.

I lowered my voice. "Come with me."

I led Paula out the back door of the café and into a dead-end alley. Savannah followed us.

Here, no one could hear us, so I felt more at ease and raised my voice. "What do you mean it's your fault? Is Jason's disappearance related to you?"

"Explain everything to me now!"

Paula's expression became even more panicked. She said, "Mrs. Jordan, please forgive me. I really meant well. I didn't expect things to turn out like this. I didn't mean to mess things up."

I suppressed my anger and said in a low voice, "Explain."

Paula then carefully recounted the whole story.

It turned out that after Paula recorded Shirley and Brandon's conversation for me, Brandon came back a few days later.

This time, Paula overheard the address where Shirley was hiding Jason.

But instead of telling me immediately, she secretly contacted James.

Because Shirley and James were hiding Jason together.

Paula threatened James to hand over the child, but James refused.

However, Paula had kept all the evidence from when James raped her, including the stains on her clothes.

So she used this to threaten him, and James quickly gave in.

Paula told him to take Jason and hide him somewhere else.

But when James returned to where he was hiding the child, he found that Jason was already missing.

Afraid of being exposed, he told Paula that Jason had been taken to a safe place. But no matter how much Paula pressed him, James wouldn't reveal Jason's whereabouts.

Eventually, Paula went to James's house and pressured him again. He finally admitted that Jason was missing.

The place where James hid Jason was known only to him and Shirley. If it wasn't him, then Shirley must have taken the child.

After Paula finished, she looked at me cautiously. "Mrs. Jordan, I really meant well. I didn't expect things to turn out like this."

I frowned at her. "Then why didn't you tell me immediately? If you had told me right away, would we be in this situation now?"

Paula knew she was wrong and trembled. "Mrs. Jordan, I just wanted to handle it first and then tell you. I didn't expect things to turn out like this. I really didn't. I didn't mean to, Mrs. Jordan."

I snorted coldly. "I'm telling you, if anything happens to Jason, I won't let you off."

"Since you say James took Jason, take me to him now. I need to ask him myself!"

But Paula's face became even more hesitant. She looked at me and said, "I think this might not be related to James."

"Because I made another mistake."

I frowned at Paula. "Spit it out!"

Paula said, "Back when there was a heated debate online about whether Jason was Earl's or Brandon's child, Shirley secretly took a strand of Jason's hair and Brandon's hair for a paternity test."

I frowned at her. "And then?"

"Later, I received the paternity test results. It said Jason was Brandon's biological child, so I took it upon myself to change the report to say he wasn't and gave it to Shirley."

I frowned, feeling a sense of foreboding.

"Shirley initially thought Jason wasn't Brandon's child, so when she took him, she didn't plan to harm him. After all, it had nothing to do with Brandon."

"But recently, she found the real paternity report in my room."

"When I got home from work, I found the real paternity report missing, and Shirley started acting very strange. A few days later, Jason went missing, so I suspect..."

I glared at her, furious. "Paula, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to get that child killed?"

Paula, terrified, quickly knelt down. "No, no, Mrs. Jordan. I've always been on your side. I never wanted to harm anyone. I just wanted to get back at Shirley."

I looked at her, breathing heavily. "Then tell me, what's your relationship with Renee? Why did I see you following her at that party?"

###chapter 112

"Renee?"

Paula's face showed a flicker of confusion, and it didn't seem fake.

I scoffed. "Don't play dumb. At the party that night, you followed Renee into the private room with something. What were you up to?"

Paula thought for a moment before responding. "You mean that night?"

"Yeah, that night. Ms. Jordan asked me to bring some stuff to their room and told me to wait at the door without leaving."

I studied her face. I didn't buy a word Paula was saying.

"So, what were you really doing that night?"

Paula hesitated, glanced at Savannah, and finally said, "Ms. Jordan asked me to bring drugs to him, so I didn't dare tell anyone."

I was taken aback and frowned at Paula. "Keep going."

She explained the events of that night in detail.

Turns out, the reason Renee hadn't shown up was because she was in the private room with her friends doing drugs.

They were using drugs in the room, and when they ran out, Renee came out to find Paula and asked her to get more.

I interrupted her. "Who did you get the drugs from?"

Paula, looking down, said, "Earl."

Earl?

I recalled his clean-cut face. He didn't seem like the type to do drugs.

I asked her, "Do you often see Earl doing drugs at the company?"

Paula shook her head. "Mr. Jordan never does drugs. In fact, he seems to hate them. Whenever Renee asks him to get drugs, he always looks disgusted but still does it."

I didn't expect there to be a story between them. I kept my expression neutral and let Paula continue.

"I know it's illegal, but Renee threatened me. I didn't dare refuse, or she said she'd fire me. So, I had no choice but to follow her with the tray."

"In the private room, they were all sitting on the couch, and I was stationed at the door. They didn't care about me because they knew I wouldn't dare say anything."

I looked at Paula's expression and asked, "Did you hear anything else outside the room?"

I asked this to see if Paula was lying. If she said she didn't hear anything, she was definitely lying because I had clearly heard her ask someone a question when I entered the adjacent room.

Paula thought for a moment and then nodded. "Yes, there was a knock at the door or something. Renee asked me to check, but when I looked, no one was there."

She looked at me cautiously. "Mrs. Jordan, was that you that night?"

I scoffed. "Don't ask questions you shouldn't. How many people were in Renee's room? Did you recognize any of them?"

Paula shook her head honestly. "They were all foreigners."

"Did they talk about anything else?"

Paula shook her head. "No."

Foreigners. They must be from her international group. Why did she bring them here? Or have they been staying here all along?

I turned to look at Savannah. The red light on the recorder in her pocket was still flashing.

I took out the recorder and said to Paula, "Are you sure you're not lying? I'll be handing this evidence to the police."

Paula immediately dropped to her knees. "Please don't! I'm not lying. If you give this to the police, I'm done for. They'll know I was involved in drug trafficking!"

Paula kept bowing her head, tears streaming down her face.

Seeing her like this, I wasn't sure whether to believe her. Paula was hard to read.

"Don't worry. Even if I hand over the evidence, I'll mask your voice. They won't know it's you."

"But you have to tell me the truth. Otherwise, I'll release this recording to the police."

Paula nodded repeatedly. "Thank you, Mrs. Jordan. Thank you. I've told you everything I know. I haven't hidden anything!"

Under threat, Paula probably wouldn't lie. So, it's likely that Jason was taken by Shirley after discovering the truth.

I needed to find Shirley quickly and ask about Jason's whereabouts. The longer it took, the more danger Jason could be in.

After a moment of thought, I said, "Take me to your place."

Paula, eager to show her loyalty, agreed without hesitation and led us to a high-end apartment complex.

I knew Brandon had bought this place for Shirley and Paula, but I didn't expect it to be in such a prime location.

It seemed Shirley was important to Brandon. Otherwise, with his personality, he would have discarded her once she was exposed.

But regardless of who bought the house, Brandon used our marital assets, so half of it was mine. I knocked on the door confidently.

No one answered, so Savannah pounded on the door. Soon, there was movement inside. "Who's there?"

When Shirley opened the door, Savannah kicked it open, and we walked in boldly.

I didn't let Paula show herself. I still needed her, and this wasn't the right time for her to appear.

Shirley was stunned to see me. "What are you doing here? Why are you in my house?"

I rolled my eyes. "Your house?"

"Do you deserve to live in such a nice place?"

Shirley's face darkened. "So what? Brandon bought this house for me. What does it have to do with you?"

I sneered. "Don't forget, Brandon used our marital assets. So, half of this house is mine. You're living in my house, and I can kick you out anytime!"

Shirley's face twisted with anger. "Don't try to scare me. Brandon said this house was a gift to me!"

Savannah brought me a chair, and I sat down, looking at Shirley's furious face. "What right does he have to give you a house? You're just a maid."

Shirley laughed coldly. "You're still in the dark, aren't you? Brandon and I have been together for a long time. He even promised to make me his wife!"

Maybe she was provoked, but she started spilling all the dirty details about her and Brandon.

Shirley spoke with a dreamy expression. "When you were half-dead, Brandon and I made love in your room, right next to your bed. You didn't know that, did you?"

Hearing this, I felt nauseous.

"Brandon and I are one in body and soul. What right do you, a dying woman, have to interfere in our affairs?"

###chapter 113
I clenched my fists in anger, never expecting them to do something so disgusting right next to me.

"Go on, what else do you have to say?"

I took a deep breath, struggling to keep my anger in check.

Shirley looked at me smugly. "We did it all over that house. While you were sleeping."

"Brandon even told me herself that she doesn't like you. She hates your arrogant attitude."

"Is that so?"

I let out a sudden laugh.

Shirley frowned. "Are you out of your mind? If I were you, I'd leave Brandon and set her free. What happiness can you give her?"

I rolled my eyes. "I can't, but you can, right?"

"Of course. I understand Brandon better than anyone. I know exactly what she wants."

I looked at Shirley's smug face and smirked inwardly. Let's see how smug you are in a minute.

"Where's Jason?"

I couldn't be bothered to argue with them anymore and got straight to the point.

Shirley's face showed a flicker of guilt, but she stubbornly replied, "Who's Jason? I don't know any Jason."

I rolled my eyes again. "Stop pretending. Didn't you take Jason? Where is he? Hand him over!"

Shirley put on a defiant look. "I don't know where Jason is. It's got nothing to do with me. Get out of here, or I'll call the cops!"

I sneered. "Call the cops? Do you dare?"

I pulled out a test report from my phone and threw it in Shirley's face. "Remember the night you came to our house and took something? You put something in my water, didn't you? I knew it all along. As soon as it was morning, I had the contents of that cup tested. It was poison."

Shirley's face changed, but she still argued, "You can accuse me with anything these days. It wasn't me. I don't know what you're talking about."

I rolled my eyes again. "We can check the fingerprints to see if it was you. I still have the cup."

Shirley clearly didn't expect me to keep the cup, and she was momentarily stunned.

"You..."

"Where is Jason? I'm asking you one last time."

Shirley looked at me and sneered. "You're still worried about Jason? Do you even know that Jason is your hus

###chapter 114

Brandon glanced at Shirley, guilt written all over his face.

"Sweetheart, I swear, I didn't mean to keep this from you."

"The company was in the middle of a crucial partnership negotiation, and I couldn't risk any bad news leaking out. I had to handle it this way."

I crossed my arms and let out a bitter laugh. "And how does that justify hiding Jason? Are you saying he's your kid?"

Brandon looked down, hesitating. "I honestly don't know, babe. There was just that one time with Elora. She came on to me, and I got played."

I couldn't help but laugh at his excuse. Shirley had just been tricked by her, and now Elora was the same. Brandon, are you a child, always getting tricked?

I don't buy it. If he didn't have any intentions, would they really strip in front of him?

"Back then, when you went home to have the baby, you had Elora stay by my side to guide me. For you and the baby, I wanted to run the company well. Who knew Elora would start making moves on me?"

"Of course, I didn't accept it. I had already clearly rejected her, saying I loved you and wanted to spend my life with you, so she shouldn't waste her time. But Elora just wouldn't give up."

"I thought about firing her, but then at another party, I got drunk, and Elora took me to a hotel. And then... it happened."

Brandon didn't finish, but his head hung low, looking regretful, like an innocent boy who had been deceived.

If I didn't know his true nature, I might have been fooled by his act.

"Because you were pregnant at the time, I thought I couldn't tell you. I was afraid you'd get so upset that it would harm the baby. So, I fired Elora and cut off contact with her. But then she suddenly came back, saying she was pregnant."

"I was terrified. I thought I'd settle her down first, then find a way to convince her to get an abortion and then get rid of her."

"But she secretly went abroad to have the baby. I had no idea. When she came back, she already had a child with her!"

A strange anger flared in Brandon's eyes. "Later, I found out Elora had also slept with Earl. This kid might be Earl's. Sweetheart, I was tricked by them. I'm a victim too."

"Really?"

Brandon nodded. "Yes, sweetheart. You don't know, Earl and Renee are in cahoots. They teamed up to take over our company."

"If I hadn't been holding the fort all these years, the company would have been swallowed up and taken abroad by them..."

I caught the unfinished part of his sentence. "What about abroad?"

Brandon realized he had slipped and quickly shook his head. "I don't know. I just know Earl and Renee seem to be doing some business abroad and need money. They keep asking me for money."

I stared at Brandon. "So, the money that disappeared from our accounts recently, did you transfer it abroad to them?"

Brandon hesitated for a long time before nodding. "Yeah, babe. But I didn't touch anything else. Renee said she needed the money, and if I didn't give it to her, she'd use her status as your sister to pressure me. I had no choice. The company didn't have any cash at the time, so I used the money we saved for the kids."

"Do you know what kind of business they're doing abroad?" I asked, eyeing him closely.

His eyes flickered with evasion, then he shook his head. "I don't know."

I suddenly laughed. I knew Brandon too well. This was exactly how he acted when he was hiding something. He definitely knew what Renee and Earl were up to abroad. He might even be involved.

But right now, he was pushing all the blame onto those two.

I smirked. "Brandon, that's my company. Why didn't you tell me?"

Brandon looked at me cautiously. "I was scared, babe. Because I'm part of the Jordan family, I thought you wouldn't trust me. I didn't dare tell you. I thought I could handle it myself. Who knew Earl and Renee would get worse over the years? I really can't hold on anymore."

I crossed my legs and sneered. "Brandon, you're just useless."

"Let me be honest with you. I don't need this company. After the urban renewal, I'm still wealthy. This company was just to help you develop your skills, and look what you've done."

A dark look flashed in Brandon's eyes. He gritted his teeth but still nodded. "I know I was wrong, babe. I shouldn't have kept it from you."

"Babe, if you can forgive me, I'll listen to you from now on."

I didn't say anything and looked at Shirley.

She was staring at us with a jealous expression.

"But Shirley said you don't love me. You're just with me for my money," I said, pretending to be innocent.

Brandon gritted his teeth and kicked Shirley again. "If you keep talking nonsense, I'll beat you."

He turned to me, his eyes sincere, his attitude earnest. "Babe, believe me. I really love you. I have no other intentions."

"I just want to spend my life with you and the kids. I was wrong, babe. Don't believe those bitches' lies."

It seemed he had heard me say on the phone earlier that I wouldn't divorce him, so he was feeling confident.

"Babe, think about it. If you divorce me, what about the kids?"

"Don't you want our three kids to grow up in a complete family?"

He was actually using the kids to threaten me. I felt nothing but disdain.

In my view, an unfaithful husband is the most unqualified father, so I didn't mind replacing him.

Of course, replacing him wasn't for now. I needed to wait for a better, more suitable time.

Right now, Brandon was more useful as a tool for me to manipulate.

"Will you do these things again?"

Seeing me relent, Brandon's eyes lit up. He quickly shook his head. "No, definitely not. Babe, I was really wrong."

"I won't get involved with other women anymore. I won't even look at anyone else. I'll only look at you."

"You're the most beautiful in my heart!"

After his flattery, Shirley snorted disdainfully, glaring at us with jealousy.

###chapter 115

I shot a look at Shirley and said, "But Shirley, that's not what you said earlier."

Brandon glared at Shirley. "My wife's just talking nonsense. Don't believe a word she says."

"Is that so?" I smirked at Shirley. "Then go ahead and slap her."

Shirley lifted her head and glared at me before turning to Brandon with a look of deep affection. "Brandon, I know she's rich, but I'm willing to live a poor life with you. We don't need her dirty money. Let's leave together, okay?"

I couldn't help but laugh at Shirley's words.

Brandon's expression changed instantly. He stepped forward and slapped Shirley hard across the face. "Who wants to leave with you? What do you think you are?"

Brandon sneered at Shirley. "If it weren't for you drugging me back then, I would never have looked at a maid like you in my entire life."

"You're not even worthy to shine my shoes!"

Brandon's words were so harsh that Shirley was stunned, tears slowly streaming down her face.

I thought to myself, it's pathetic that Shirley has been with Brandon for so long and is only now seeing his true colors.

After hitting Shirley, Brandon returned to my side and knelt down again. "Honey, do you have anything else to say?"

I looked down at him. "Are you sure you only have these two women? If I hear any more rumors about you and other women, I won't forgive you."

Brandon nodded quickly. "Don't worry, honey. There won't be any other women." Just then, Shirley let out a cold laugh. "You're really stupid to believe anything he says."

Brandon turned and glared at Shirley. "Shut up."

But Shirley ignored him and continued, "You probably met Maeve at the party, right? She's one of Brandon's women. And there are many more you haven't discovered. Want me to list their names for you?"

"Caroline, stop acting like you know everything. You have no idea how many women Brandon has."

It seemed that after being slapped, Shirley had seen the reality and was determined to reveal the truth.

I looked at Brandon. "Is what Shirley said true?"

Brandon shook his head repeatedly. "Of course not, honey. You have to believe me. How could I be involved with so many women?"

Shirley laughed again. "If you don't believe me, you can go to my room. I have photos of him with many women. You'll see I'm telling the truth."

Brandon looked like he wanted to kill Shirley. He never expected her to expose all his secrets.

"And the most important thing is he also..."

Before she could finish, Brandon lunged forward and grabbed Shirley by the throat, stopping her from speaking further.

"Shut up!" Brandon growled through gritted teeth.

I had a feeling that what Shirley was about to say was crucial, but Brandon didn't let her finish.

I glanced at Savannah, signaling her to go to Shirley's room and find the photos she mentioned.

Brandon wanted to stop her but realized that doing so would only make him look more suspicious, so he backed off.

Savannah quickly returned with a stack of photos from Shirley's nightstand and handed them to me. "Ms. Sharp, these are all of them."

Brandon fell to his knees in front of me. "Honey, I was wrong. I was out of my mind back then. I thought I was something because I had a company. I was wrong, terribly wrong. Please forgive me."

"I swear, from now on, I won't have anything to do with other women. Please forgive me, honey."

I looked at the photos of women I had never even seen before, all intimately close with Brandon. I looked at Brandon and said slowly, "So, while I was sick these past few years, you were out there with other women?"

Brandon hung his head in silence.

I raised my hand and slapped Brandon hard across the face, the sound echoing in the room.

Brandon didn't make a sound, kneeling there motionless.

"Brandon, you're a bastard!"

"I used to think you loved me so much!"

"Let me tell you, I don't want my three kids to grow up without a father, but if you really did all these things, I can still kick you out."

Hearing my words, Brandon finally panicked and started kowtowing, apologizing. "I'm sorry, honey. I don't want to lose you. I was wrong. Please forgive me this once. I won't have any more affairs."

Shirley, watching from behind, suddenly burst into laughter, blood dripping from her mouth from Brandon's slap.

"Brandon, I never thought you'd end up like this. You deserve it!"

"People like you should be cut into pieces and sent to hell. You deserve it!"

Brandon's eyes were filled with rage. He turned and punched Shirley hard in the face.

Shirley fell to the ground, clutching her face and crying out in pain.

"You damn woman, you dare to spy on me? I'll kill you!"

Shirley was lying on the ground, barely conscious.

Seeing that he was about to beat Shirley to death, I shouted, "Stop it!"

Brandon immediately stopped and came over. "Honey, are you willing to forgive me? I didn't mean it."

Of course, I couldn't forgive him. Shirley still had secrets I wanted to know, including Jason's whereabouts, so I couldn't let him kill her.

Shirley was lying on the ground, barely alive. I gave Savannah a look, signaling her to take Shirley to the hospital.

Brandon wanted to stop Savannah but didn't dare move when he saw my expression.

I looked down at him. "Brandon, this is your last chance. Will you ever do this again?"

Brandon shook his head decisively. "Absolutely not. You have to believe me, honey."

I knew that promises from Brandon were worthless, so I didn't care. Instead, I continued, "Where is Jason? Why is he missing?"

Brandon hesitated. "I asked Shirley to handle that. If she doesn't say, I don't know either."

Now I was truly angry. "Brandon, no matter what, Jason is innocent. How could you plot against a child? Are you planning to harm my children next?"

###chapter 116

Brandon quickly shook his head. "How could I, babe? I'd never hurt our kid. That boy isn't mine; he's Earl's."

"So that makes it okay to ignore him?"

I glared at him, my anger simmering. "Is that why you don't care about him?"

Brandon, clueless about the source of my anger, could only apologize.

What he didn't know was that Jason reminded me of my own children.

If I hadn't caught Brandon drugging me back then, my three kids might have ended up like Jason.

Even though Elora is a terrible person, I can't help but feel sorry for Jason. He's just an innocent child.

"Don't worry, babe. I'll send someone to find him right away, okay? I'll definitely bring Jason back."

He seemed sincere, so I nodded.

He helped me up. "Babe, please don't be mad at me. Let me take you home. You need to take care of yourself."

I shot him a cold look. "If I die of anger, wouldn't that be just what you want? Then you can bring your mistresses home."

Brandon waved his hands frantically. "No way! Babe, you're the love of my life."

I went home with Brandon, who kept trying to please me the whole way, massaging my legs and shoulders.

But I found him repulsive and avoided his touch.

Once home, Brandon wanted to stay by my side, but I shooed him away. "Aren't you worried about being ousted from your company? Go back to work."

Brandon nodded quickly, grabbed his briefcase, and rushed out.

I called Savannah to check if she had settled Shirley in.

Savannah confirmed, "She's settled."

I felt relieved and warned her not to let anyone know which hospital Shirley was in. I feared Brandon might try to kill her.

After all, if he could scheme against a child like Jason, who knows what else he's capable of.

Savannah, efficient as always, soon returned from the hospital.

That night, Brandon wanted to come home, but I told him to stay at the office. I didn't want to see him.

Leaning on the balcony, I felt a rare sense of relief, as if some of my pent-up anger had been released by Brandon's behavior today.

Feeling unusually cheerful, I asked Savannah to bring some wine.

Savannah hesitated. "Miss, you're still recovering. Drinking might not be a good idea..."

I waved her off. "It's fine. I'm happy today. Just a little won't hurt."

Savannah went to the kitchen, and soon after, Royce called.

His voice was deep and soothing. "In a good mood today?"

I knew Savannah would inform Royce, but I didn't mind since it was her job.

I gave a low hum and recounted the day's events to Royce.

"I finally got some satisfaction today and want to celebrate with a drink."

To my surprise, Royce agreed quickly. "Go ahead, but don't overdo it."

I nodded, then realized, "Why do I need your permission to drink? I'll drink if I want to."

Royce chuckled but didn't say anything.

Standing on the balcony, feeling the cool night breeze and listening to our breaths over the phone, I felt an immense sense of peace.

Royce said, "I'm not there right now, but when you succeed in your revenge, I'll drink with you."

I nodded, and after hanging up, Savannah soon brought the wine.

I grabbed two glasses from the nearby cabinet and placed them in front of her. "Can you drink?"

Savannah nodded. "I can."

That's what I wanted to hear. I poured the wine into her glass. "Then drink with me tonight."

Savannah hesitated but quickly agreed.

We sat across from each other on the balcony, sipping our wine.

I never expected Savannah to have such a low tolerance. After just two glasses, her face turned red, and she slumped over the table, drunk.

I couldn't help but laugh and nudged her. "You can't hold your liquor, can you? No wonder you don't drink."

Savannah groggily lifted her head. "Did I drink too much? No, I didn't."

"Yes, you did. You're about to fall asleep."

Savannah shook her head. "Ms. Sharp, you told me so much about your past. Let me tell you my story."

I nodded, agreeing.

"I used to be a special forces soldier. I loved it. Whenever there was a peacekeeping mission abroad, I always volunteered because I had no family or responsibilities."

"Then, on one mission, I got injured. Stepped on a landmine."

She pointed to her ear. "My left ear is deaf now."

I was stunned. I never imagined Savannah had been through something like that.

"After that, I couldn't go on missions anymore. They put me in logistics, filling out forms and writing reports. I hated it. I wanted to be on the front lines, but my superiors wouldn't allow it."

Savannah, drunk, continued, "So I quit in a fit of anger. Later, I met Mr. Castillo."

"I was drinking heavily at a bar when a thug tried to hit on me. I broke his arm and kicked him aside. Mr. Castillo saw it and asked if I had combat training."

"I needed someone to talk to, so I told him my story. Even though my ear was damaged, my skills were intact."

"Mr. Castillo then told me about you and asked if I wanted to protect you."

"Being a bodyguard was something I would have never considered. I even looked down on it. But after hearing your story, he said something that made me agree immediately."

I was slightly tipsy, leaning back in my chair. "What did he say?"

"Mr. Castillo said that being on the front lines was about protecting the country, but being your bodyguard was about protecting the people of the country. It's all the same, no better or worse."

###chapter 117

"I came to find you right away because of what Mr. Castillo said."

"When I met you, I realized my past negativity was nothing. I only lost hearing in one ear, but you were in such a dangerous situation and still managed to escape."

She raised a glass of wine to me and said, "I must toast to you."

I chuckled softly and clinked my glass with hers.

After finishing her drink, Savannah collapsed onto the table, falling asleep in a drunken stupor.

Listening to her story made me suddenly miss Royce. I don't know why, but I just wanted to hear his voice, so I called him.

On the other end, Royce's voice was as gentle as ever. He asked, "Did you finish drinking?"

I responded quietly, "Savannah just told me her story and how you found her at the bar."

Royce didn't say anything, his breathing steady.

I took a deep breath. "Thank you."

He laughed softly. "I told you, you don't need to thank me."

"But I still want to say thank you!"

We both fell silent. I knew calling him tonight was a spur-of-the-moment decision fueled by alcohol.

A gust of night wind cleared my head a bit.

"I should go."

I broke the silence, and without waiting for Royce's response, I hung up.

My heart was pounding. I sighed softly, realizing I had been too impulsive tonight. Drinking really does cause trouble.

I woke Savannah and sent her to her room to sleep, then I went to my room and had a solid night's sleep. The next morning, I felt refreshed.

I hadn't slept so soundly in a long time. It felt great.

After getting up, I asked Savannah to take me to the hospital she had found to check on Shirley.

I didn't know how badly Brandon had hurt her, but Shirley was now in the ICU, covered in tubes.

The doctor told me Shirley's condition was very serious last night, so they had to transfer her to the ICU urgently.

I nodded, feeling helpless. All I could do was ask the doctor to do everything possible to save Shirley. After all, she was still useful to me.

I went downstairs to pay for Shirley's treatment. From now on, her fate was in the hands of the doctors.

Of course, I didn't tell Paula about Shirley. Paula hated Shirley, and if she acted impulsively and did something uncontrollable, I couldn't bear the consequences. So, I chose not to tell her.

Paula asked me where Shirley had gone. I just told her Shirley was away for a while and would be back soon.

Even if Paula had doubts, she didn't dare to question me.

Savannah and I left the hospital and decided to stroll around the nearby pedestrian street. Unexpectedly, we saw Isadora standing in front of a man, yelling at him.

When I got closer, I realized she was yelling at Celestia's ex-husband, Alfonso.

"You bastard! You were with this woman while you were still married to Celestia. Why didn't you divorce her sooner?"

I looked closely and saw the woman next to Alfonso was Aurelia, whom I had seen at the celebration party.

Aurelia crossed her arms and looked at Isadora coldly. "Do you have any proof? Celestia was just unlucky to have such a husband and ended up dying in a car accident."

Isadora, furious, stepped forward and slapped Aurelia hard. "Say that again!"

Aurelia, shocked and angry, looked at Alfonso with teary eyes. "She hit me."

Alfonso glared at Isadora coldly. "Celestia has been dead for years. Aren't you going too far? Do I need your permission to date someone?"

I motioned for Savannah to follow me and walked up to Isadora. "Isadora, long time no see. What are you doing here?"

Seeing me, Isadora calmed down and glared at Aurelia and Alfonso before saying to me, "Nothing, just ran into some dogs while shopping."

Aurelia snapped, "You..."

Alfonso's face darkened, but seeing me, he didn't dare to get angry. Instead, he extended his hand to me. "Mrs. Jordan, it's been a while since the celebration party. I heard you had some trouble?"

I nonchalantly flipped my hair. "Yeah, I was kidnapped."

Seeing me speak so casually about it, Alfonso and Aurelia's expressions changed.

"Are you okay? Mr. Jordan must have been worried sick," Alfonso said hypocritically.

"Of course, I'm fine. Not only am I in great health, but I also managed to beat up a mistress."

As I mentioned the mistress, I looked directly at Aurelia.

"Brandon's mistress got caught by me. Mistresses are so shameless, always ruining families. Don't they have any morals?"

My words were pointed, and Aurelia's face turned dark. She glared at me but didn't dare to retaliate.

Alfonso, knowing I was referring to Aurelia, forced a smile. "Mrs. Jordan, enjoy your shopping. We have to go."

With that, he took Aurelia and left. Isadora watched them leave, gritting her teeth. "Just wait. I'll find out what you did back then!"

I patted her shoulder. "Calm down. Are you pregnant?"

Isadora looked at me in surprise. "How did you know? I just found out less than a month ago."

I smiled. "I have experience. I could tell by looking at your face."

Talking about the baby softened Isadora's expression. She gently touched her belly. "Yes, I haven't told the baby's father yet. I want to surprise him on his birthday in a few days."

I nodded, unable to help but laugh. "Mr. Banks will have a very memorable birthday."

Isadora, imagining the scene, covered her mouth and laughed too.

We strolled around for a while before I urged her to go home and rest. Early pregnancy can be tough, and I didn't want her to overexert herself.

Isadora agreed and called Marshall to pick her up.

As Savannah and I were about to head home, I suddenly received a call from Leo.

He asked when I would return to Suncrest City so he could arrange for Briar to accompany me.

I had completely forgotten about this and quickly promised to return soon.

I then remembered to call Kelly.

I hadn't called her in a few days, and she sounded a bit annoyed. "What have you been up to? Why haven't you called me?"

I couldn't tell Kelly the truth, so I made an excuse.

"I've been swamped with work. Now that things have settled down, I plan to come back in a few days. How does that sound?"

Kelly snorted. "I think you don't care about your mom. Don't bother coming back."

###chapter 118

I hung up Kelly's call and let out a long sigh of relief.

Thank goodness she doesn't know what I've been through these past few days. If she did, she'd be worried sick and probably wouldn't sleep for days.

Savannah and I got back home, but Brandon wasn't there yet.

Maybe he's avoiding me because he knows I'll yell at him, so he's just trying to see me less.

Honestly, I'm fine with that.

Just as we got home, Simon called me.

I answered, and he immediately said, "Our people have tracked Brandon to Renee's house."

I was stunned, unable to believe it.

After everything I said a few days ago, did Renee and Brandon not have a falling out?

What does it mean that he went to her house, knowing full well that Renee isn't on his side? Was everything he showed me before just a lie?

I couldn't help but shiver.

"Does Brandon know something? Why would he go to Renee?" I asked, feeling uneasy.

Simon sounded puzzled too. "We don't know what he's up to yet. We'll just have to take it one step at a time."

My unease grew. I couldn't stand the thought of all my efforts going to waste.

"What if they find out about our plans..."

Sensing my anxiety, Simon reassured me, "Don't worry, we're all here for you. There's no way we'll let them get away with this."

"Trust the law and trust us. We'll be the ones who win in the end."

Hearing his words, I nodded. "Okay."

After hanging up, I sat on the couch, deep in thought.

I was strategizing for the future. My revenge against the Jordan family was at a critical stage.

I couldn't afford to give up now, nor could I let my plan fail.

I thought for a long time, sitting on the couch, and finally realized that thinking alone wouldn't help. I needed to move forward.

After all, not seeking revenge was a dead end. I might as well go all out. If it came to it, I'd file for divorce from Brandon. Even if it took years, I could handle it.

With that thought, I felt a sense of clarity. The frustration I had been feeling dissipated.

Savannah looked at me with concern. "Ms. Sharp, Brandon..."

I waved her off, unconcerned. "He can do whatever he wants. From now on, we'll take it one step at a time. Like Simon said, we'll deal with things as they come. I refuse to believe that Brandon, a high school dropout, can outsmart me."

Seeing my renewed determination, Savannah finally relaxed and nodded.

That evening, Brandon came home with a bouquet of roses.

I knew he was trying to win me over. I took the roses and looked at them.

"You still know how to come home. What were you doing today? Why are you back so late?"

I pretended to question him, trying to find out where he'd been.

Of course, Brandon wouldn't tell me the truth. He just said, "I was meeting a client today, so I got back late."

"And I didn't want to make you mad. I know you can't stand me right now, so I thought I'd give you some space."

He sounded a bit aggrieved, and I couldn't help but scoff.

"If you really don't want to make me mad, then cut ties with all your mistresses. I won't be angry at all."

Brandon hugged me, swearing, "Honey, believe me, I'll never do anything so foolish again. I was immature before, but now I see how good you are. I'll never look for another woman again. You'll be the only one for me."

I rolled my eyes and pushed him away. "Alright, go take a shower. You reek of alcohol."

Hearing my softened tone, Brandon chuckled and went upstairs to shower.

Savannah had been listening to our conversation and sneered at Brandon's words.

"He won't have any other women in his life..."

I caught the implication in Savannah's words and asked, "What do you mean?"

Savannah gave me a mysterious smile. "Ms. Sharp, do you know where he was so late?"

I shook my head. I had no idea if his client story was true.

"Don't forget he has that nasty disease. He went to get treatment."

"But the doctor treating him is one of Mr. Castillo's people. Mr. Castillo specifically instructed the doctor to add something to his medication."

"What kind of something?"

I was puzzled, not quite understanding.

"Something to make him impotent."

I finally got what Savannah meant and couldn't help but laugh. "Royce really knows how to play dirty."

Ever since I found out Brandon might have that disease, I've tried to keep my distance from him.

But sometimes, he still did things that disgusted me, and I had to find excuses to avoid him.

Royce's move was perfect. It solved the problem once and for all.

I bet even after Brandon's disease is cured, he'll be pretty upset when he finds out he's impotent.

Feeling much better, I said, "Thank Mr. Castillo for me."

Savannah winked at me. "Thank him for what? Mr. Castillo did it all for you."

"Look at Mr. Castillo-handsome, rich, and kind. After you get divorced, you should consider him."

Another one of Royce's advocates. I gave her a helpless look. "How much did Royce pay you to say this?"

Savannah quickly waved her hands. "Not a penny. I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart. Ms. Sharp, you should really consider Mr. Castillo."

I sighed. "The gap between Royce and me is too wide. We're not high school kids anymore. It's impossible."

Seeing that Savannah wanted to say more, I quickly gestured for her to stop. "Alright, enough. I'm going upstairs to shower and rest. It's been a busy few days."

Savannah nodded and said, "I'll go run your bath."

As I soaked in the tub, I thought about what Savannah had said.

I knew what Royce wanted and the looks he sometimes gave me.

But as I said, we're not high school kids anymore. The nearly ten years that have passed are a gap we can't bridge.

My marriage to Brandon has left me scarred. I don't want to step into another one.

###chapter 119

When I got up in the morning, Brandon was already at the dining table, munching on the breakfast Savannah had made.

He looked up at me and said, "Savannah's cooking isn't as good as Holly's. How about we take a trip back to Suncrest City sometime? We could bring the kids and Holly back."

Did he just say "we"?

I replied casually, "Let's talk about it after you're done with this busy period. Do you even have time to go to another city right now?"

Brandon shook his head. "No, things have been crazy with the overseas partners."

I gave him a pointed look. "This opportunity is huge for our company. You need to make the most of it, got it? This is your last chance to prove yourself."

Brandon nodded, understanding the gravity. "Don't worry, babe. I won't mess it up."

Just then, his phone rang. When he saw the caller ID, Brandon glanced at me nervously before stepping away to take the call.

Usually, Brandon didn't hide from me when taking calls from suppliers or partners, but this time he was being so secretive. Something was definitely up.

I pretended not to care and continued eating breakfast, but I kept an eye on Brandon out of the corner of my eye.

I could vaguely hear bits of his conversation. It was about some kind of stock partnership. If it was just that, there was no need for secrecy-unless he was up to something shady again.

When he finished the call and came back, I asked nonchalantly, "Who was that?"

Brandon hesitated for a moment before saying, "Just some company stuff. They need me to go in and handle it. I'll leave after breakfast."

I impatiently urged him, "If it's company business, you should go now. Why are you waiting around? Do you think I can't eat without you here?"

Brandon was taken aback by my tone, then quickly nodded and grabbed his bag to leave.

I turned to Savannah and said, "Get in touch with Simon and the others. Have them keep an eye on Brandon. That call just now seemed off."

Savannah nodded seriously, her military training evident in her swift actions. She rushed into another room and made the necessary arrangements within minutes.

Once I was sure she had arranged for Brandon to be followed, I felt a bit more at ease.

Knowing your enemy is key to winning any battle, so I needed to keep tabs on Brandon.

Just then, I received a call from an unknown number.

Savannah and I exchanged glances.

I answered the call.

A man's voice on the other end asked, "Is this Caroline?"

I was surprised but replied, "Yes, this is Caroline. How can I help you?"

"This is the police. We've found some evidence related to Jason. We need you to come in and identify it."

I exchanged another look with Savannah and immediately headed to the police station.

When Jason first went missing, we reported it to the police. I never thought they'd find evidence now. Maybe this could lead us to Jason.

At the station, a female officer led us to a meeting room.

A male officer, presumably the one who called, joined us.

He handed me a bag containing some items. "Can you identify if these belong to Jason?"

"We haven't been able to reach any of Jason's immediate family. Since you reported the case, we contacted you."

I was taken aback. "What about Earl? He's Jason's father."

The officer shook his head. "We haven't been able to reach Earl."

Something flickered in my mind, but I couldn't grasp it.

I looked at the evidence bag. "Honestly, I don't know Jason that well. You know Elora was suspected of being my husband's mistress. I've only seen Jason a few times from a distance."

"So I might not recognize these items."

The officer nodded. "We understand, but we have no one else to ask. Please take a close look. This is about a child's safety."

I nodded solemnly and took the evidence bag.

Inside was a small bracelet with some engraved patterns.

It was clearly a child's bracelet, too small for an adult.

There was also a piece of fabric with dirt on it, its original color unrecognizable.

I examined them carefully, trying to recall any connection to Jason, but nothing came to mind.

After all, my interactions with him were limited. My only impression was that Jason was a very cute boy. If not for his parents' issues, he might have grown up in a healthy environment.

"I'm sorry, I don't recognize these."

The female officer looked anxious. "Please take another look. These were found on a beach. We need to confirm if they belong to Jason. If they do, it means he might be..."

I was stunned, understanding the implication.

"Are you saying Jason might already be..." dead?

I couldn't bring myself to say the word. I stared at the officer, who looked troubled and sad.

"That can't be. Why would anyone harm a child? Are you sure there's no mistake?"

The officer shook her head, remaining silent. The male officer spoke up. "We received a report from a villager near the beach. They saw a man with a child one night. The man left, but the child was gone."

"We investigated and found these items on the ground."

"We're trying to see if we can connect this to Jason's case."

My mind was reeling, barely able to hear the officer.

I couldn't believe such a sweet child could be harmed, especially in such a cruel way.

Sensing my distress, Savannah placed a hand on my shoulder. "Ms. Sharp, the villager might have been mistaken. There's no conclusion yet. Anything is possible. Please don't be upset."

I nodded, taking a deep breath. "I have to hold onto that hope. There's nothing else we can do."

###chapter 120

My eyes were glued to the two items inside the evidence bag.

I racked my brain for any relevant clues, but came up empty.

The conference room was dead silent; everyone was waiting for me to say something.

I stared at the items, hoping they were just some kid's forgotten toys.

The bracelet's pattern sparkled, almost blinding me.

As I focused on the pattern, it hit me-Jason was two years younger than Brett.

Realizing this, I dropped the items, and they clattered to the floor.

The officers looked at me. "Did you remember something?"

I couldn't believe my own thoughts, but I had to say it, my voice shaking.

When I mentioned that Jason was two years younger than Brett, the two officers in front of me tensed up, nodding seriously. "That's a good lead, but don't lose hope. Maybe a nearby villager rescued the kid, or the guy just took him to a nearby fishing village and didn't throw him into the sea."

"Until we find Jason, nothing's certain. No news is good news."

I nodded at the officer's words. "Thanks, I really appreciate it. Jason's been through so much."

The officers nodded back. "Don't worry, we'll do everything we can to find him."

I thanked the officers and Savannah helped me home.

Savannah was really worried about me. "Ms. Sharp, try not to think too much. Maybe Jason's really okay."

"We just need to wait for the police to bring good news."

"Why don't you try to get some sleep?"

I nodded and went upstairs in a daze.

But as soon as I closed my eyes, all I could see was Jason's face, drenched and looking at me with those sad eyes.

He kept saying, "Come save me, come save me."

I couldn't help but walk towards him, wanting to pick him up.

But Jason seemed miles away, no matter how much I walked, I couldn't reach him.

I started to panic and ran.

But the more I ran, the farther he got.

Jason's cries grew louder, heart-wrenching, calling out to me.

I kept trying to comfort him, "Don't be scared, I'm here, don't be scared, I'll find you soon, I'll find you soon."

Until he ran so far that I couldn't see him anymore.

I woke up with a start, standing up and gasping for air.

Savannah looked at me worriedly. "Ms. Sharp, what happened?"

I looked at Savannah, still in shock, covered in sweat, breathing heavily like a stranded fish.

"I, I just dreamed of Jason."

Savannah sat down and patted my back. "Ms. Sharp, try not to think about it. You have to believe the police will find him."

I nodded, the fear still lingering in my heart, and I couldn't help but let out a long sigh.

After Savannah left, I tried to sleep again, but I just tossed and turned, my mind replaying the dream over and over.

I kept telling myself, it's okay, it's okay, dreams are the opposite of reality. Jason will come back safe and sound.

I waited at home for two days, with no word from the police.

But I tried to stay positive, thinking that no news was the best news in this situation.

Until that night, when the police called, asking me to come over immediately.

A bad feeling surged through me, and I rushed to the police station.

The same two officers from before greeted me, their faces heavy with concern.

My sense of dread grew stronger, and I spoke first, "You don't have any news, right? It's okay, I can wait, I'm not in a hurry."

The female officer shook her head slowly.

The male officer sighed deeply and said, "We found a surveillance camera at a nearby fisherman's warehouse. It happened to capture the scene on the beach that day."

I was stunned. "And then?"

My voice was already trembling.

The male officer said, "You should see for yourself."

I walked to the computer and looked at the screen.

The screen showed dark waves, the pixelation indicating it was zoomed in.

The sound of the waves was relentless, like a monster in the night, evoking deep-seated fears.

I clenched my fingers, staring at the screen, afraid to miss any clues.

Then, a figure flashed by, a man carrying a child towards the sea.

I stared at the screen, seeing the man holding Jason, and Jason seemed to like or at least be familiar with the man, not resisting at all.

In the darkness, the bracelet on the man's hand sparkled.

I didn't know what the man said to Jason, but Jason clung to him, unmoving.

Then the man put Jason down, the sea water covering Jason's feet.

The man said something else to Jason, who nodded and stayed still.

The man turned and walked away, not looking back, without a trace of reluctance.

Jason stood in the waves like an obedient child, soon engulfed by a large wave.

The dark wave, like a monster's mouth, swallowed Jason's small figure, pulling him into the vast ocean.

I took a deep breath, feeling like I couldn't breathe.

Who was it? Who was so cruel to want to kill Jason, an innocent child?

He deliberately left Jason by the sea to be swept away by the waves, such a vicious method.

And Jason seemed to trust this man so much, but all that awaited him was the deadly waves.

The police said to me, "We asked you to come to identify the man next to him."

"The child didn't resist, which means he trusted this man, maybe someone close to him."

My heart skipped a beat, and I nodded.

At that moment, I felt like I was fighting a demon, one that was ruthless and unscrupulous.

But I was powerless.

###chapter 121

I stared at the screen, watching the footage over and over again.

Savannah was worried about me and suggested I go home and rest.

I waved her off. "No, I feel like I know this guy. Maybe I can figure out who he is."

I kept scrutinizing the footage, frame by frame, trying to find something familiar about the man.

He was very cautious, completely covered in black, making it impossible to see who he was.

I could only rely on his build, walking style, and other subtle details to identify him.

His walk was distinctive-short, but with a swagger that made him sway side to side.

After a long while, a name suddenly popped into my head: Earl.

Yeah, Earl wasn't very tall, but he had a walk that made him seem taller. Karen had mentioned it before-how he always swayed like a tall person, even though he was quite short.

This trait matched Earl perfectly.

I jumped up excitedly. The police saw me and immediately asked, "Do you know who it is?"

I nodded firmly. "He looks a lot like Earl."

The police were stunned and skeptical. "You mean Jason's father, Earl?"

No one could believe someone could be so cruel as to harm their own child.

But I shook my head. The missing pieces in my mind finally connected.

Earl wasn't Jason's biological father. His real father was Brandon.

It was a long-standing misunderstanding.

Initially, Earl thought Jason was his son and doted on him, as did Brandon.

But when Earl's affair with Elora was exposed, Brandon began to have doubts.

Coincidentally, Shirley had done a paternity test for Earl and Jason, while Paula had made a fake one.

Somehow, the real test ended up with Earl, and the fake one with Brandon.

Brandon misunderstood, thinking Jason wasn't his son, while Earl discovered Jason was actually Brandon's son.

Earl grew resentful and took it out on Jason.

But the key question was, how did Earl get Shirley's paternity test?

Did she give it to him on purpose?

I couldn't figure it out. Clearly, Shirley had more secrets to reveal.

I told the police that Earl wasn't Jason's biological father, and that Brandon was.

The police exchanged glances. "Thanks for the info. It's really important. We'll start monitoring Earl right away, and if the evidence checks out, we'll arrest him."

I nodded, feeling a heavy weight in my chest. The dream I had a few days ago had come true.

I never imagined someone could be so evil as to harm a child.

But without evidence, we couldn't arrest Earl yet, which was frustrating.

Savannah helped me home. Brandon was sitting on the couch, watching TV, happily drinking beer and eating barbecue.

When he saw me, he looked pleased. "Hey, you're back! You won't believe how well my meeting with the partners went today. I'm so happy, I started celebrating early. How about we go out for a fancy dinner?"

Savannah helped me to the couch. He looked puzzled. "Are you feeling unwell again?"

I looked at Brandon and couldn't help but sneer. "Jason is dead."

Brandon froze, staring at me in disbelief, but there was no sadness in his eyes.

"Really?"

He acted like he was hearing about a stranger, not caring at all.

I couldn't help but sneer. "Yes, really. I just came from the police station. They're going to search the area for Jason's body in the next few days."

Brandon showed no emotion, just nodded and reached for his beer.

I couldn't control my anger anymore. I slapped the beer out of his hand and flipped the coffee table.

Brandon looked at me, confused and frowning. "What are you doing?"

"What do you think I'm doing? I can't stand you feasting like this."

Brandon's eyes filled with anger. He had been putting up with a lot to appease me, but now he couldn't hold back.

"That was Earl's kid. What does his death have to do with me? Why are you taking it out on me?"

"And for a kid you barely knew, you're really going this far?"

I sneered. "Brandon, are you really that clueless?"

"Jason is your son."

Brandon was stunned, looking at me in disbelief. "What are you talking about? How is that possible?"

"When Elora had the baby, there was a paternity test, but Shirley later told me that woman tricked me. She had bribed the person doing the test."

"Shirley told me she did a paternity test for me and the baby, and it showed the baby was Earl's, not mine."

I couldn't help but laugh bitterly. "The child is yours. The paternity test was switched by Paula."

Brandon was finally shocked. He grabbed my shoulders, urgently asking, "What do you mean?"

I told him the truth, leaving out the crucial parts.

Seeing his disbelief, I sneered. "Jason is your biological son, but when Earl found out, he chose to kill him without hesitation. Are you really family?"

"And don't you wonder how Shirley's fake paternity test ended up with Earl? Maybe someone close to you has already betrayed you."

Brandon was in complete disbelief. His worldview was crumbling.

"And do you think Earl acted alone? Wouldn't Renee support him?"

"Think about it, Brandon. You've been fooled by them all along. They killed your son, and you didn't even know, helping them launder money. You're a fool."

I watched Brandon's darkening expression, then went upstairs, not caring what he thought.

I couldn't believe that after this, Brandon would still trust Earl and Renee like before.

###chapter 122

Brandon took off in a hurry, but how he planned to handle Earl and Renee was their problem.

Just then, I got a call from the police. They told me Earl was missing from his house.

I was shocked and quickly asked, "How could he be missing? Weren't you guys keeping an eye on him?"

The officer replied, "After you tipped us off, we rushed to his place right away. But it was already empty. Looks like Earl knew we were closing in and took off early. We're checking nearby surveillance to see if we can figure out where he went."

I nodded, "Alright, if you need anything, just let me know. I'm here to help."

The officer thanked me and hung up.

That night, Brandon stumbled back home, drunk, and collapsed onto the couch like a sack of potatoes.

I looked at his drunken state and asked, "Did you find Earl?"

Brandon shook his head and rolled over on the couch. I didn't buy it for a second.

I called his name a couple more times and reached for his phone.

Brandon didn't react at all, clearly too drunk to notice.

He was already out cold, snoring softly.

If even Brandon couldn't find Earl, it meant Earl had slipped away without Brandon knowing.

I thought for a while and suddenly realized that Renee might know where Earl went.

It seemed like a good idea to visit her house tomorrow. Maybe I could find some other clues.

But right now, I had a golden opportunity to check Brandon's phone. He had been keeping a lot of secrets lately, often leaving early and coming back late.

I unlocked his phone and tried to access his second system, only to find that he had changed the password.

I glanced at him, realizing that Brandon was being cautious.

I had five attempts to guess the password. Knowing Brandon, he liked to use significant dates as passwords, often celebrating them with a drink.

I thought for a while and had a sudden inspiration. Maybe it was the day he sealed his overseas deal.

I entered the date, and sure enough, the password was correct. I accessed his second system.

It seemed he had cleaned it out, leaving almost no traces.

His WhatsApp chats were mostly deleted, with only a few unimportant ones left.

Brandon was indeed very careful.

There was only one contact pinned at the top, someone with a red spider lily avatar, but the chat history was cleared. They must have been in touch recently.

His suspicious car club group chat had nothing new, and Simon was keeping an eye on it. If there was any news, he would have told me.

But the person with the red spider lily avatar seemed suspicious. I decided to take a screenshot of the WhatsApp contact and send it to Simon for investigation.

Simon quickly replied, asking what I meant.

I explained the situation, and he understood immediately. "Got it. I'll handle it."

With his assurance, I felt relieved.

At dawn, I told Savannah that we needed to visit Renee's house.

Just as I finished speaking, Brandon came downstairs, holding his hungover head, looking dazed. "Morning, babe!"

I glanced at his disheveled appearance and nodded absentmindedly.

"I need to go to the hospital with Savannah later. We didn't get our discharge papers last time, so we need to sort that out."

Brandon nodded and asked, "Do you need me to come with you, babe?"

I shook my head. "No, Savannah will be with me. You should head to the office after breakfast. It's crucial to keep an eye on things during the early stages of the partnership. We can't afford any slip-ups."

Brandon didn't suspect anything, as I was telling the truth.

He nodded and agreed.

After Brandon left for work, Savannah and I headed out.

We went straight to Renee and Leo's villa.

I rang the doorbell, and Leo answered, looking surprised to see me. "Caroline, what brings you here? Are you leaving already?"

I quickly waved my hand. "No, I'm here to see Renee. Is she home?"

Behind Leo, Briar peeked out, and I greeted her.

Leo shook his head. "She's not home. She left in a hurry a few days ago, said she had to go on a business trip. I don't know what it's about."

"A business trip?"

I was taken aback.

How could it be such a coincidence? Earl had just gone missing, and now Renee was on a business trip. It was hard to believe they weren't connected.

But without evidence, even the police couldn't do anything.

I stood at the door, my expression growing serious.

Leo stepped aside and asked, "Caroline, why don't you come in and sit for a while?"

I hesitated for a moment but agreed.

As soon as I entered, I felt a blast of cold air.

It was already fall, yet they still had the air conditioning on.

I had heard that Renee often felt hot, a common issue for drug users, so she insisted on keeping the air conditioning on 24/7.

It was convenient for her, but poor Leo and little Briar had to suffer.

Briar often caught colds because of it.

I hadn't realized how much Renee's habits affected Leo and Briar. Even with Renee gone, they didn't dare turn off the air conditioning.

I asked, "Isn't it too cold for you and the kid with the air conditioning on so high?"

Leo was taken aback, then smiled. "We just wear more layers. Renee doesn't like it hot."

I shook my head helplessly and didn't press further, letting them be.

I sat on the couch, and Briar brought me a cup of hot water.

Looking at Briar's innocent and sweet face, I couldn't help but sigh. She was a good kid, just born into the wrong family.

Briar looked at me curiously, so I smiled and said, "In a few days, I'll take you to Suncrest City. Did you know that?"

"Let me tell you, it's a lot of fun there. You can swim in the river and catch little fish and shrimp with Brett and the others."

Kids naturally love to play, and sure enough, Briar's eyes lit up at my words.

Thinking of Jason, my heart ached.

They were all unfortunate children, caught up with the Jordan family's mess.

So I could only do my best to help them whenever I could.

###chapter 123

I asked Savannah to take Briar out to play while Leo and I settled on the couch, ready for a chat.

I shot Savannah a quick look, signaling her to keep an eye on things around us.

Savannah caught on immediately and reached out to Briar, saying, "Hey Briar, wanna come play with me?"

Briar nodded shyly and took Savannah's hand, heading off to play.

I had noticed that Leo seemed to have something on his mind, but with Briar around, he hadn't said anything.

I turned to Leo and asked, "Leo, does Renee not come home much?"

Leo's face froze for a moment before he regained his composure. "She's just really busy with work, you know? So I'm the one handling things at home. It's understandable."

It seemed like it wasn't just about being busy with work; there might be more to the story.

I decided to dig a little deeper. "Do you take care of Briar all by yourself? Does Renee help out at all?"

Mentioning the child brought a hint of bitterness to Leo's face, and he shook his head. "No, you know how busy she is."

"But now that Briar is growing up, there are things I can't teach her as a man. I want Renee to come back and help, but every time I ask..."

He trailed off, but I understood what he meant.

Leo looked at me with envy. "I really admire your family. Your kids have both parents around, and at least they get complete love."

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh. Every family has its own struggles. Mine isn't any easier than Leo's.

"Actually, my family has its own challenges. Brandon is busy with work and rarely comes home. I was sick recently, and when Brett was little, it was the nanny who took care of him."

"I totally get how you feel because I also think Brett missed out on our presence."

Leo nodded. "But now you're better, and I heard Brandon's career is back on track?"

I nodded. "Yes, he recently closed a deal with an overseas company. It's a busy time, so he can't be home much."

"But it's good that Brandon cares. Renee doesn't even have that. She doesn't even call."

I sighed. "It's tough. I went back home recently because of some issues he had. Sometimes I think about divorce, but for the sake of the kids, I try to make it work."

Leo was taken aback, his eyes widening. "Brandon? What issues? He seems like a good guy."

I looked at him, surprised he didn't know about Brandon's recent scandal.

"He just had some issues, you know how it is when men get money... But I'm not talking about you, Leo. You're a good man."

He nodded. "I'll talk to Brandon. How could he mess around when you were sick at home?"

I waved it off. "It's in the past. He promised it wouldn't happen again, so I'm giving him another chance."

Leo nodded. "Marriage is about making it work. As long as he changes, it's fine."

I didn't respond. If Brandon could change, pigs would fly.

I looked around. The house was spotless, thanks to Leo.

"Leo, do you clean the house yourself?"

Leo nodded. "I don't have much to do, so I clean up after work and help Briar with her homework."

"After work?"

I caught that Leo was still working. "You still work? Renee makes good money."

"I remember when we weren't sick, you lived in a big house. Now it's a villa."

Leo smiled wryly. "Renee doesn't leave us money. We moved, but we still need money for daily expenses. She doesn't think about these things, so I have to work to support Briar and myself."

I nodded, unsure what to say. This was the life Leo chose. I wondered if he regretted it.

"By the way, Leo, where do you work now? Maybe Brandon can help you get a job at his company. You were good at your job."

Leo waved it off. "No need. I work as an accountant at a small company. It's easy, and I can pick up and drop off Briar."

Since he said that, I didn't push. "That's good."

"Leo, I wanted to tell you, we're planning to take Briar to Suncrest City soon. I'll get her passport and buy her a ticket."

Leo's eyes lit up. "Thank you so much."

I couldn't fully trust Leo, but I knew he loved his child.

"No problem. We're family. Briar is like my own child."

Leo thanked me, and just then, Savannah came back with Briar.

Briar was giggling on Savannah's back. They seemed to have bonded.

Leo quickly stepped forward. "Briar, you shouldn't be on her back. Get down!"

Savannah laughed. "It's fine. I used to carry weights twice Briar's size. This is nothing."

Briar clearly enjoyed being on Savannah's back and didn't want to get down.

I said, "Leo, let them play. Savannah loves playing with kids. Briar's been cooped up and needs to have fun today."

###chapter 124

Seeing the situation, Leo could only nod helplessly and tapped Briar on the forehead. "We'll talk about this later when our guests leave. That was really rude."

Briar stuck out her tongue playfully, clearly not taking his words seriously.

It seemed Leo usually treated Briar very well. Otherwise, if he were truly going to scold her, she wouldn't be acting so carefree; she'd be scared.

Savannah and I exchanged a glance, and she gave me a barely noticeable nod, indicating she had thoroughly checked out the house.

I felt more confident.

The tea on the table had gone cold. Leo stood up to pour me another cup, but I quickly stopped him. "No need, Leo. I should get going. I have some things to take care of."

Leo paused, then stood up to see me off.

Briar, who had taken a liking to Savannah, insisted on coming along. She clung to Savannah's wrist, reluctant to let go.

Savannah patted Briar's head. "I'll come play with you next time."

Seeing Briar about to follow us out, I quickly intervened. "No, you should stay home. You haven't been well lately, remember? You had a fever not long ago. Stay here and rest. We'll take you to Suncrest City to play soon, and then you can have all the fun you want."

Briar looked at me, puzzled. "Fever? I didn't have a fever. Dad said I'm very healthy."

I was taken aback and looked up at Leo, who had a strange expression on his face before quickly returning to normal.

"Briar, you must have forgotten. You did have a fever recently."

It seemed that the last time I ran into Leo at the hospital, he had lied to me. He wasn't there to get fever medicine for Briar.

As for why he was at the hospital, I had a hunch it had something to do with Renee, but I couldn't be sure.

Briar still looked confused. I waved it off. "Kids are like that. They feel terrible when they're sick but forget all about it afterward."

Leo smiled and nodded. "Alright, we won't see you out then. Drive safely."

After Savannah and I got in the car and started driving out of the neighborhood, she began to tell me about the details she had noticed.

"It looks like Renee hasn't been home for a long time. In their bedroom, there's only one pillow, and the bathroom only has one set of toiletries. Even if she didn't come back often, those things wouldn't be put away. This means she hasn't been back for a while."

I nodded. "Yes, Leo told me the same thing. It seems he wasn't lying about that."

"But Brandon came looking for Renee recently, and she was here. Plus, Leo initially told me Renee was on a business trip and wouldn't be back for a few days. There's a contradiction here."

I voiced my doubts, and Savannah shook her head, equally puzzled. "I don't know. It seems everyone in the Jordan family has their secrets."

I nodded in agreement, and we drove home together.

As we got out of the car, Savannah received a phone call, and her expression changed suddenly.

"Ms. Sharp, Shirley has escaped."

I was stunned. "What happened?"

"Shirley was in the ICU for a day and then transferred to a regular room. She woke up quickly, and I had people watching her, so she didn't move much and continued her treatment. But today, when the nurse came to check on her, she was gone."

I felt a sense of foreboding.

I quickly called Simon. "Hey, is there another problem?"

Simon's voice was as nonchalant as ever. "Shirley is missing from the room we arranged. Can you track her?"

Simon sounded unconcerned. "No problem. I secretly put a tracker on her phone. I'll check it out."

I was relieved to find Simon more reliable than I had thought.

He didn't hang up, and we waited in the car. Simon quickly came back with the information. "You won't believe where she went."

I frowned slightly. "Where?"

Simon chuckled. "Shirley went home, back to the house Brandon bought. I have no idea what she's thinking."

"I'll head over there and check it out. Wait for my video."

I nodded, feeling reassured. Honestly, I hadn't expected this. Shirley had managed to escape from the hospital, only to go back home?

Savannah and I exchanged a glance, ready to see what was happening once Simon sent the video.

We got out of the car and went inside. Brandon was lying on the couch, looking miserable, clearly hungover from the night before.

Seeing Savannah, he immediately ordered, "You're finally back. Get me a glass of milk."

Savannah looked at me, and I nodded for her to go ahead.

I sat down on the couch. "Who told you to drink so much last night? Feeling awful now, aren't you?"

Brandon sighed deeply. "Yeah, it's terrible. Drinking is a mistake."

"By the way, why are you back so late?"

I kept a straight face. "We got held up by something on the way. Have you eaten?"

Brandon rubbed his face and shook his head. "No, I have a headache. I'll drink the milk and then take a nap."

I nodded without saying anything. Soon, Savannah brought the milk and handed it to Brandon.

He drank it with a frown and was about to go upstairs when I received Simon's video.

I opened it and saw Shirley standing at the door, facing four or five real estate agents.

"Who gave you permission to sell my house? Brandon bought this house for me. I don't agree to sell it, so no one can buy it!"

The voice in the video made Brandon stop in his tracks. He turned to look at me. "What's going on?"

I gave him a mysterious smile. "Looks like you won't be getting that nap. Come with me to check this out."

"Let's see what Shirley is up to."

Brandon looked annoyed. He didn't want to go, but he was afraid Shirley might reveal some secrets if left alone with me, so he had no choice but to come along.

He sat in the car with a sullen face, clearly on the verge of losing his temper.

###chapter 125

When we got to Shirley's house, she was alone, waving a mop handle at a few real estate agents.

Shirley was still in her hospital gown, with bandages on her hands from the IVs, and her face was bruised from where Brandon had hit her.

When she saw us, she looked relieved and turned to Brandon. "Brandon, isn't this the house you bought for me? They're trying to sell it!"

"Everyone out! This is my house, and the owner is here. Get out!"

The real estate agents turned to us. "Who's the owner here? You said you wanted to sell this place, and now this woman says we can't. Are you selling or not?"

"Yes, yes, we're selling. This is the owner, and I'm his wife. I decided to sell the house."

Shirley glared at me. "Who gave you the right to sell my house? Brandon bought this house for me. Tell them to leave!"

Shirley looked worn out from her time in the hospital. Her cheekbones were sunken, and she looked gaunt and pale, a far cry from her previously clean and delicate appearance.

"Brandon, didn't you buy this house for me? Tell them."

Brandon gritted his teeth, veins bulging on his forehead. "When did I ever say I bought it for you? Do you think you deserve it?"

He was clearly at his limit, probably suffering from a hangover after drinking last night, and now this commotion was making it worse.

"Shirley, get out of here now. This house isn't for you!"

Shirley was stunned, not expecting Brandon to say that. "How can that be? Didn't you say..."

Brandon cut her off. "What did I say? When did I say I was giving you this house?"

"Shirley, you're just a maid. Do you think you deserve it?"

The crowd started murmuring.

"I thought she was his mistress. Turns out she's just a maid. She's got some nerve, thinking she can stay here."

The murmurs made Shirley break down. She looked at Brandon with a pained expression.

"Didn't you say you were giving me this house? Now you're changing your mind? Didn't you say..."

Brandon interrupted her again, glancing at me before glaring at her. "What did I say? I never said I was giving you this house. I just let you stay here for a while, and now you won't leave."

"And you drugged my wife. I haven't even dealt with that yet. My wife forgave you, but I haven't. Do you want me to call the police?"

I knew there was more to this, but Brandon didn't want her to say it.

Shirley glared at us. "Fine, you want me to leave? You'll regret this."

She went back inside and quickly packed two suitcases, dragging them out.

As she passed the real estate agents, they looked at her with disdain. "A maid acting all high and mighty. I thought she was a mistress, but she's not even that. What a joke."

Shirley's face was pale with anger. Before leaving, she shot me and Brandon a venomous look and gave a sinister smile.

"This isn't over."

She mouthed something to me and then left without looking back.

I exchanged a glance with Savannah, signaling her to follow Shirley and see where she was going.

Savannah got the message and slipped away while Brandon wasn't paying attention.

Brandon's eyes were bloodshot, and he gritted his teeth. "That damn woman should never have come to our house."

I looked at him and sneered. "Weren't you the one who gave her false hope, making her think she could be your wife?"

Brandon fell silent, forcing a smile. "Honey, what are you talking about? You'll always be my wife, no one else."

I didn't respond, just rolled my eyes at him.

After Shirley left, the real estate agents quickly brought in potential buyers, and Brandon and I got in the car to go home.

I told him, "By the way, I'm planning to go back to Suncrest City in a few days. Are you coming with me?"

Brandon was taken aback but quickly nodded. "Of course, honey. I'll go with you."

"I haven't seen Mom in a while. I'll go back and spend some time with her."

I nodded. "Alright, I'll book your ticket. Briar is coming with us too."

Brandon frowned, clearly unhappy. "Why is she coming?"

It seemed Brandon still held a grudge against Renee, and by extension, her daughter Briar.

"Briar is bored at home. I want her to come with me to play with Brett. Do you have a problem with that?"

Brandon didn't dare oppose me, quickly shaking his head. "No, no problem. She can come if she wants."

"Honey, I'll wrap up things at the company, and then we can go and relax. You need to take care of yourself at Mom's place."

When we got home, Savannah was already there. We exchanged a look, and she nodded, indicating she hadn't lost track of Shirley.

Paula was nowhere to be seen, probably having moved out after Shirley was hospitalized. There were no signs of his belongings in the room.

Finally home, Brandon relaxed a bit. "Honey, I'm going to take a nap. Don't wait for me for dinner."

After he went upstairs, I asked Savannah, "Did you find out where Shirley went?"

Savannah nodded. "Shirley went to see James. I didn't want to be gone too long and make Brandon suspicious, so I came back. I left someone else to keep an eye on them. If Shirley and James make any moves, we'll know right away."

She had handled it perfectly, and I nodded in satisfaction. "Good thing I have you. I wouldn't know what to do otherwise."

Savannah scratched her head and smiled shyly. "It's my job to serve you, isn't it?"

###chapter 126

That night, I didn't want Savannah to overwork herself, so we decided to order takeout instead of cooking.

After dinner, we fell asleep and didn't wake up until the next morning when I got a phone call.

It was the male officer from the police department who had been in touch with me before.

In a somber tone, he said, "We've found Jason. Do you want to come see him?"

My heart sank. I knew what he meant-Jason's body had been found.

I gripped my phone tightly, feeling a lump in my throat. "I'll be there."

After I told Savannah about it, she looked equally somber.

As long as the body wasn't found, there was still a glimmer of hope that he might be alive. But now that he was found, it meant everything was over. That vibrant little life was truly gone.

Just then, Brandon woke up. Seeing us standing together in silence, he asked, "What's going on? Savannah, make me some breakfast."

He was used to ordering Savannah around.

I looked at him. "How can you think about breakfast right now?"

Brandon seemed confused. "What's wrong, honey?"

I said in a low voice, "Jason's body has been found. He's your child too. You should come with me to the police station."

I expected to see at least a hint of pain in Brandon's eyes, but there was nothing-just avoidance.

"I think I'll pass. You know how busy I am with work."

He was pushing my limits again. I couldn't help but sneer. "You're going, whether you like it or not. That's your child! How can you be so heartless?"

Brandon wanted to argue but couldn't find the words. He knew I was right. He just nodded. "Fine, let's go quickly and get it over with."

I rolled my eyes.

How could someone be so despicable? What kind of upbringing did the Jordan family give him?

Savannah drove us to the police station. The male officer who had been helping us was waiting at the entrance.

Brandon hesitated, looking reluctant.

The officer noticed his behavior. He knew about the recent media coverage and what I had told him, so he knew Brandon was Jason's biological father.

Seeing Brandon's reaction, the officer frowned. "Are you Brandon?"

Brandon nodded, impatiently urging, "Let's get this over with."

His tone was devoid of any sadness, just irritation.

The officer frowned. "We have procedures to follow. Rushing won't help. Aren't you the child's father? Don't you want to see him one last time?"

Brandon had no response and just kept quiet.

I ignored him and turned to the officer. "Let's go. I want to see him as soon as possible."

The officer's expression softened. "Follow me."

We signed several documents before we were allowed into the morgue to see Jason.

At the morgue's entrance, Brandon hesitated again. "Honey, maybe I shouldn't go in..."

I finally lost my patience. "Brandon, that's your son in there, not mine. As his father, don't you think you should see him one last time?"

"I could tell he liked you a lot. If his spirit knows you came all the way here but didn't dare to see him, how do you think he'd feel?"

Brandon had no choice but to follow me inside.

As soon as we entered the morgue, a cold, eerie air hit us. Brandon shivered and instinctively hid behind Savannah.

We all looked at him like he was a clown but said nothing.

The officer pulled out a metal drawer from a cold storage unit, revealing a small figure covered with a white sheet.

The officer said, "The child was in the water for a long time. When we retrieved him, his body was already in bad shape. This is after our forensic team worked on him. Don't be scared."

I nodded, feeling a pang of sorrow as I thought of Jason's sweet face.

What had he gone through? Such a small child, alone in the water for so long.

He must have been so cold.

I said, "Sir, please open it. I'm prepared."

The officer slowly pulled back the sheet from the feet up.

Jason's small feet were now blue and purple, the skin peeling away to reveal the flesh beneath.

Brandon screamed, drawing everyone's attention.

I frowned and focused back on Jason.

He wasn't wearing any clothes, so I could see all the injuries on his body, the skin covered in sores.

Finally, the sheet was pulled up to his neck.

The officer was giving me time to prepare, so I said, "I'm ready."

The officer nodded and pulled the sheet back completely, revealing Jason's face.

His once lively, cheerful face was now covered in scars.

Brandon screamed again and ran out of the morgue.

Savannah cursed under her breath, "What a coward."

I didn't respond, just looked sadly at Jason's face.

He used to be so adorable, with big, round eyes. Now, they were closed, his face showing a frightened expression, his brows furrowed.

He must have been scared for a long time before he died.

I gently smoothed Jason's brow. "Jason, promise me you'll be happy in your next life. Don't come back to a family like this."

I asked the officer, "Can I dress him? I don't want Jason to leave like this."

The officer nodded. "Go ahead."

I reached out to Savannah, who handed me a set of clothes we had prepared. We dressed Jason from head to toe.

His small limbs were stiff, but it was easy to dress him, just like when he was alive-a well-behaved child.

I put on his socks and shoes, squeezing his hand. "Sweet boy, now you won't be cold."

###chapter 127

After getting Jason dressed, I turned to the police officer.

"Can we take him with us now?"

The officer shook his head, looking sorry. "I'm afraid not. The case is still open, so he has to stay here for now."

I nodded, trying to stay calm.

"Any updates on Earl?"

"I've got another lead. The day Earl disappeared, his sister Renee, who's also Brandon's sister, was on a business trip. Seems too coincidental, don't you think? You might want to check it out."

The officer nodded seriously. "Thanks. That's helpful. We'll start looking into it right away."

As we left the morgue and walked into the police station courtyard, we saw Brandon leaning against a wall, looking like he was about to puke his guts out.

When he saw us, he rinsed his mouth and walked over. "When are we heading back?"

I couldn't hold back anymore. "Brandon! How can you be so heartless towards your own kid? Is this how you treat our children too?"

"That's your kid. Why do you always look so impatient?"

Seeing my anger, Brandon quickly tried to calm me down. "Babe, in my heart, I never saw Brandon as my son. I only care about you and our kids. Believe me, I don't like Jason at all."

His words only made me angrier. I glared at him. "Then why did you let him be born? Why let him suffer like this?"

"Brandon, if I hadn't survived my illness recently and had died, would you treat my child the same way?"

Brandon quickly waved his hands. "No way, babe. I only care about our three kids."

I sneered. "Then why didn't you think about using protection with Elora? You should face the consequences of your actions. Now you won't even look at him, and you refuse to be a father. Are you even human?"

Brandon's face turned pale from my scolding. A crowd had gathered in the courtyard, watching our argument.

He took a deep breath and tried to calm down. "Babe, let's talk about this at home. Not here."

"So you know not to air dirty laundry in public? Why didn't you think of that when you were with another woman?"

I turned and walked away without looking back. Brandon hurried to catch up.

We got into the car, with Brandon sitting beside me, trying to soothe me. We were about to head back to Suncrest City, and he didn't want Kelly to notice anything was wrong between us.

"Babe, I'll pay for the best burial plot for Jason. It's the least I can do."

"I didn't know Jason was my child before, so I neglected him. But I swear, there will never be any other children. I'll only have kids with you."

He kept trying to comfort me all the way home, and I finally softened a bit.

Brandon had to rush off to handle some final business at the company.

Savannah watched him leave and muttered, "What a jerk."

I couldn't help but smirk. "Not just Brandon. Earl, Renee, the whole Jordan family-they're all jerks who deserve to go to hell."

Savannah looked worried. "What about Earl? Are we just going to let him get away with hurting Jason?"

I frowned. I'd been thinking about this for a while. We might not be able to catch Earl, but how could we make him regret what he did?

Savannah muttered, "I thought Earl liked Jason from the photos. How could he do this? Is he even human?"

A thought struck me. "You're right. Earl liked Jason when he thought Jason was his own child. He only hurt Jason because he thought Jason was Brandon's."

"And why did he think that? Because of the paternity test report showing Jason was Brandon's son."

"We have two paternity test reports-one real, one fake. If we show Earl the fake one, making him think Jason was his own child and Brandon's report was fake, what do you think he'd do?"

Savannah raised an eyebrow, looking excited in the rearview mirror. "He'd probably lose it."

I nodded, smiling. "That's exactly what I want."

Savannah and I exchanged a knowing look, both of us plotting.

Back home, I called Simon to discuss the plan. Simon was smart and could give us good advice.

"We can't get to Earl, let alone give him the fake report."

Simon was silent for a moment, then said, "You can't reach Earl, but can Karen?"

I was stunned, then my eyes lit up.

Karen treated Earl like her own child because he was her sister's son. She always shared the Jordan family's wealth with her sister, and Brandon had always resented her blatant favoritism. But Karen was old and stubborn, so Brandon couldn't do much about it.

"Are you saying we should talk to Karen?"

"Yes," Simon replied.

I couldn't help but admire his idea. "You always have the best ideas."

Simon chuckled. "I'll take that as a compliment."

After hanging up, Savannah and I planned to visit Karen immediately. I wasn't sure if she knew about Jason's death yet.

Just as we finished planning, my phone rang. It was Royce.

"Heading to the Jordan Villa?"

I was surprised. Simon must have told Royce everything. "You sure are well-informed. How did you know so quickly?"

Royce chuckled. "I keep a close eye on your matters. Nothing slips by me."

I pursed my lips, unsure what to say.

"Do you think the plan will work? That child in the morgue today was so pitiful. I have to get revenge for him."

Royce paused. "I know how you feel. I don't want you to seek revenge, but if you can't let it go, I support you."

Hearing his support, I felt satisfied.

For some reason, Royce's support seemed especially important to me. I couldn't explain why.

###chapter 128

The next morning, Savannah and I got ready to head over to Karen's house.

I wasn't sure if Karen knew about Jason's murder yet.

I drove up to Karen's mansion and knocked on the door.

Karen answered quickly, her face immediately scrunching up in displeasure when she saw us. "What are you doing here?"

Her tone was harsh, as if we were unwelcome intruders.

I smiled, the more she disliked me, the more I wanted to be around to annoy her. "Mom, I haven't visited you in a while. Have you found Jason yet?"

A strange look flashed across Karen's face. "What do you want?"

I was certain now-Karen didn't know about Jason's death.

"Nothing much, just asking. I liked Jason too, you know."

Karen scoffed. Ever since the last time she caused a scene at my house, she had been blunt with me. "Jason is Brandon's legitimate son. Our family's future rests on him."

"Your kids, on the other hand, are all useless. They'll never amount to anything."

I wasn't angry at first, but hearing her say that, I couldn't hold back anymore.

Thinking about how Brett must have suffered every time he came to Karen's house while I was sick made my blood boil.

"Mom, that's not fair. No matter how much you dislike Brett, he's still a legitimate child. But Jason, he's just an illegitimate child."

Karen's eyes widened. "Who are you calling an illegitimate child? Jason is a Jordan!"

I actually liked Jason and felt sorry for him, but I couldn't stand the adults around him.

"A legitimate grandson? Are you sure he's Brandon's child?"

Karen's face changed. "What do you mean? Are you saying he's not Brandon's? Whose child is he then, yours?"

I quickly waved my hand. "Mom, that's not what I meant. I came to tell you the truth."

I gestured for Savannah to hand over the paternity test report I had prepared. "As far as I know, Jason is Earl's child."

Karen's face turned pale as she took the report, scanning it until her eyes landed on the 99.9% probability of paternity.

"Impossible. This must be fake. It can't be true."

"Mom, haven't you been following the news? Earl and Jason were trending recently. Their photos are all over the internet."

"Don't you know Elora had an affair with Earl? She was involved with both men in your family."

Karen's face twisted in anger. "Stop slandering us. Jason is Brandon's son."

I handed her the report. "If you don't believe me, we can get another test done. Brandon himself did this test. If Jason were really his, I would have divorced him already."

Mentioning Brandon made Karen believe me. She looked at the report in disbelief, gritting her teeth.

"That bitch Elora dared to deceive me. She deserved to die."

She stared at the report for a long time. "Even if Jason is Earl's, I've always treated Earl like my own son. His child is still my grandson."

Karen's eyes were cold as she glared at me. "You think you can drive a wedge between us? Dream on!"

"The Jordan family's future will still be Jason's."

"The Jordan family's future?" I scoffed. "Have you forgotten? Your company only exists because I handed it to Brandon. Without me, where would you be?"

"Mom, have you forgotten the days when you washed clothes in cold water in winter, your hands covered in chilblains?"

Karen's face darkened at the mention of her past. She prided herself on being wealthy now and couldn't stand having her past brought up.

"Shut up, you little bitch. Do you want me to kill you?"

She raised her hand to slap me, but Savannah, standing behind me, quickly grabbed Karen's wrist and gently pushed her back.

Karen stumbled, barely catching herself on the table.

"What do you think you're doing? How dare you hit me?"

Karen was furious, glaring at us.

"I'm going to tell Brandon."

I sat down on the couch, unbothered. "Do you need me to call him for you?"

"Let me tell you, Brandon doesn't dare argue with me now. I have evidence of his affair. I could divorce him and take everything, but I haven't because of the kids."

"If you push me, I'll file for divorce, and your whole family will end up back in the slums with no way out."

Karen gritted her teeth, knowing I was right.

"Get out of my house!"

I chuckled, settling into the couch. "Don't be in such a hurry. I have more news for you."

"I came to make sure you're informed, since you seem to be out of the loop."

"Spit it out and get out!"

I smiled. "Brandon has been found."

Karen froze, a mix of emotions in her eyes. I was sure she knew who had hidden Jason initially.

"Jason is in the morgue at the police station. You should go see him."

Karen exploded, slamming her hand on the table. "Caroline, how dare you curse my grandson. Do you think your words mean anything?"

"Get out!"

I shrugged, a bit helpless.

"How long has it been since you watched the news? Let me catch you up."

I nodded to Savannah, who pulled up the recent police report.

It stated that the missing child, Jason, had been found in the ocean.

###chapter 129

Karen's face went pale, and she dropped to the floor, completely stunned.

"This can't be real! No way, I don't believe it! This has to be a lie!"

I couldn't help but smirk at her reaction.

"Why would I lie about this? The body's at the police station morgue right now. I saw it yesterday. Wanna go see for yourself?"

"How did he die?"

Karen's eyes locked onto mine, filled with rage. "Did you kill Jason? You little witch!"

She lunged at me, looking like she wanted to strangle me.

"You owe me my grandson, you owe me my grandson."

Savannah grabbed Karen's wrist. "Where'd this crazy lady come from, attacking everyone?"

"Jason's death has nothing to do with Ms. Sharp."

Karen was shoved to the ground but still glared at me with pure hatred. "I don't believe it has nothing to do with you, you little witch. You killed Jason, and I'm gonna make sure the police lock you up."

I let out a cold laugh. "Too bad for you, that's not gonna happen. The police already found key evidence. Someone left Jason by the sea on purpose, and he got swallowed by the waves."

"You'll find out who it was soon enough."

Karen was stunned, clearly not expecting there to be evidence. Her expression hardened. "Who? Tell me, and I'll kill him!"

It was your dear nephew Earl!

Of course, I didn't say that out loud. It would be much more satisfying for Earl to realize he killed his own son.

"You'll find out soon enough, once the police uncover the truth."

Karen finally accepted the reality, her eyes filled with defeat.

She sat on the ground, her hair a mess, looking utterly broken.

But seeing her like this, I felt no sympathy, only scorn.

The way she treated Brett compared to Jason was night and day.

I couldn't muster any sympathy, only more heartache for the injustices Brett had suffered.

I stood up and looked down at Karen. "Tell me, who was behind Jason's disappearance?"

Karen sat there in a daze, not responding.

"If I'm not mistaken, it was you and Renee who conspired to frame me, making others think I kidnapped Jason."

"You thought they would take good care of Jason, but in reality, you were the one who caused his death."

Karen looked like she had aged ten years, unable to say a word.

Before leaving, I kindly told her the location of the police station where Jason's body was.

"Make sure to tell Earl to go too. After all, he is the child's real father."

After emphasizing this, I turned and left. Before stepping out, I saw Karen bowing her head deeply, lost in thought.

This is karma. He committed too many sins, and now they all fall upon the younger generation.

In this whole mess, the only innocent one was Jason. He was so young, yet burdened with the Jordan family's schemes.

In the end, he had no choice but to die in the turbulent sea, never finding peace.

Leaving Karen's house, I let out a deep breath.

I felt like a weight had been lifted off my chest, but it wasn't enough for me.

I needed to make the entire Jordan family pay for their sins.

In the car, Savannah turned to me. "Ms. Sharp, remember how Brandon mentioned handling the discharge paperwork last time? We haven't done it yet. How about we go to the hospital today?"

I nodded. Recent events had been overwhelming, sometimes making it hard for me to keep up, and I had forgotten many things.

"Good thing you reminded me, or I would have completely forgotten."

Savannah shook her head. "I can't compare to you and Mr. Castillo in strategy, so I can only help out with these little things!"

I knew she was trying to cheer me up, so I smiled.

"By the way, I don't know how much Royce is paying you. How about I double it?"

Savannah's eyes widened, and she quickly waved her hands. "No, no, Ms. Sharp. I'm already earning the highest salary in our industry. If I earn any more, I'd feel guilty."

"Besides, I haven't really done anything significant for you, and I even got you kidnapped before. Even if you docked my pay, I wouldn't complain."

Seeing her insistence, I had to give up, thinking I'd give her a bonus for Christmas instead.

Savannah drove us to the hospital. In the lobby, we unexpectedly ran into someone.

"Isadora?"

From a distance, I saw a pregnant woman sneaking a snack, and she looked a lot like Isadora, so I called out to her.

To my surprise, she turned around, her eyes lighting up when she saw me. "Caroline, what are you doing here?"

Savannah and I walked over to her. "What brings you to the hospital? We're here to handle the discharge paperwork from last time."

Isadora smiled sheepishly. "I'm here for a prenatal checkup."

I was taken aback and instinctively looked around, but didn't see Marshall.

The last time I saw them, they seemed so in love. Why wasn't he here with her for the checkup?

Seeing me looking around, Isadora seemed to understand. "Don't bother looking. Marshall isn't here."

I quickly asked, "Why not?"

Isadora stuck out her tongue, her face showing a playful and girlish charm. "He has a meeting at work this morning and can only come in the afternoon. But I wanted to sneak out and buy some snacks, so I came by myself. If he were here, he'd be watching me like a hawk, and I wouldn't be able to eat anything."

Her words made Savannah and me laugh. So Isadora was here to sneak some snacks.

Savannah and I teased her, "Aren't you afraid we'll tell Marshall? Isn't he a cop? Aren't you afraid he'll catch you?"

"Let him catch me. I've already finished eating, so I'm not worried."

Seeing her alone for a prenatal checkup, we felt uneasy. Since we weren't in a hurry, we decided to stay with her.

Just then, it was Isadora's turn for the ultrasound. We accompanied her to the ultrasound room, watching as the doctor applied gel to her belly and placed the instrument on it.

Soon, a faint image of a child appeared on the screen.

Isadora looked at it with joy. "Do you see that? That's my baby."

###chapter 130

Savannah and I nodded, both of us smiling.

"Yeah, we saw it."

This process always brings joy. After all, who wouldn't be happy to welcome a new life?

After the ultrasound, Isadora wiped the gel off her belly and asked the doctor, "Doctor, is my baby okay?"

The doctor smiled and nodded, "Everything looks great. The baby is developing well, with a strong heartbeat. It's a healthy baby."

Hearing this, Isadora was immediately relieved.

On the way out, Isadora couldn't stop sharing her happiness with us.

Her joy was contagious, and we both felt it too.

Until we saw Isadora's husband, Marshall, at the hospital entrance.

Isadora immediately became nervous, hiding behind Savannah and me.

The next second, Marshall strode over, still in his police uniform.

He grabbed Isadora's wrist and pulled her aside, "Didn't I tell you to wait for me to come with you for the check-up? What if something happened to you alone?"

Isadora glanced at Marshall guiltily, "How could anything happen? Caroline and Savannah were with me."

Marshall's gaze finally landed on Savannah and me. He nodded slightly and thanked us.

Then he turned back to Isadora, "Next time, don't come alone. You have to tell me first, got it?"

Isadora nodded obediently, "I'm sorry, I was wrong. I'll tell you next time and won't come alone."

Satisfied, Marshall nodded, said goodbye to us, and left with Isadora.

Isadora turned back and stuck her tongue out at us, seemingly happy that Marshall didn't find out she had snuck some snacks.

Savannah and I exchanged a helpless smile.

After seeing Isadora off, Savannah went to handle my discharge paperwork. She was quick, finishing everything in about ten minutes.

When I got home, Brandon wasn't there.

Lately, he's been leaving early and coming home late. I've gotten used to it, and I feel more relaxed when he's not around.

Just then, Simon called me, sounding mysterious, "Want to know where Brandon is?"

I was taken aback, "Is he up to no good?"

Because I knew if Brandon was just at the office, Simon wouldn't call me.

Simon chuckled mysteriously, "I'll send you a video."

Soon, he sent me a video call link. When I answered, the screen was pitch black.

"Where are you?"

Simon immediately put a finger to his lips, signaling me to be quiet.

I shut up and watched Simon's video feed quietly.

In the dark night, I suddenly heard a few voices.

"Mom, did you hear something just now?"

I was stunned. That voice was Brandon's. After ten years of marriage, I knew his voice well.

But what was Brandon doing out in the dark with his mom, and why was Simon following them?

I watched curiously.

Karen's voice sounded impatient, "What sound? You must have heard wrong. Hurry up and follow me."

Then I faintly heard the sound of waves.

Soon, the video lit up with a flash of firelight.

I finally saw what they were doing.

They were at the beach where Jason had died, praying on the sand.

The firelight illuminated Brandon's face, showing his uneasy and fearful expression.

Karen, on the other hand, seemed unfazed.

She knelt on the ground, placing Jason's photo in front of her.

Jason's smile in the black-and-white photo was adorable, but devoid of any color.

Karen stared intently at the fire, praying sincerely.

"Jason, I will find out who did this to you. I won't let them get away with it!"

Brandon shivered, looking around warily.

Then he seemed to glance in the direction of the camera, and for a moment, I felt like he was looking right at me.

Simon quickly lowered the camera, hiding it from Brandon.

Brandon turned back and urged, "Mom, hurry up. This place is creepy."

Karen glared at him, "What's creepy? Jason is here."

It seemed Karen's feelings for Jason were genuine. Otherwise, she wouldn't be praying for him.

Brandon grumbled, "If you hadn't insisted on hiding Jason, things wouldn't be like this now."

Karen glared at him, "Who was I doing it for? Wasn't it to get rid of Caroline and free our family from her control?"

"And now none of you appreciate it. You all blame me. Do you want me to die for Jason?"

Brandon looked at Karen helplessly, "Mom, when did I ever blame you? But you should have discussed it with me back then. You can't just make decisions on your own."

"And Caroline is useful to us now. From what I know, their old house can bring in billions from urban renewal. Do you know how much that is? It's more than Caroline's company can make in years."

"If Caroline finds out what you're doing, she might run, and we won't get any money."

After Brandon finished speaking, Karen fell silent.

Savannah clenched her fists in anger, "These bastards, aren't they afraid of karma?"

I chuckled, "Bastards don't fear karma. They just take others' wealth without guilt."

"Let's see who wins next."

"I won't just ruin Brandon's plan. I'll make him lose everything and turn him back into a pauper."

Savannah nodded, "I'm with you, Ms. Sharp. Let's take down the Jordan family together."

In the video, Brandon and Karen finished burning the paper.

Karen muttered something under her breath.

Suddenly, the flames on the ground flickered.

###chapter 131

Brandon was already a bit of a scaredy-cat, and seeing this scene made him even more terrified.

He screamed, "It's haunted! It's haunted!"

Karen's face was pale, her expression tense as she stared at Jason's photo.

"Jason, is that you? Have you come back?"

The photo of Jason, illuminated by the flickering firelight, seemed to sway back and forth, almost as if it were responding to Karen.

Seeing this, Brandon became even more frightened. He let out a shriek and hid behind Karen.

Karen, looking at Jason's photo, said, "Jason, if you have a grudge, go after the person who wronged you."

"Tell me, was it Caroline who hurt you?"

The photo, which had been swaying moments before, suddenly went still, as if the wind had died down.

Karen whispered, "So it wasn't Caroline. Then who was it that hurt you?"

"Tell me, and I'll avenge you!"

But the photo remained silent, standing there as if the earlier movement had been a coincidence.

After Karen finished her prayer, the photo didn't move again.

The two of them cleaned up the scene and left with the photo.

It was only then that Simon spoke up, "What just happened?"

I paused for a moment before saying, "Maybe Jason came back for a look."

After hanging up with Simon, it wasn't long before Brandon returned.

He looked shaken, still carrying the fright from earlier.

I glanced at him and smirked inwardly, "Where did you go? Why do you look so scared?"

Brandon shook his head, "It's nothing, just got spooked by a stray dog on the way."

"Really?"

I kept my face neutral and continued, "I had a dream earlier. Want to hear about it?"

Brandon, still rattled, replied absentmindedly, "What dream?"

I stared into his eyes and said, "I dreamt of Jason, at the beach where he died. His soul was crying in the water."

As I spoke, Brandon's face turned even paler.

"Really? Honey, don't scare me."

I smiled at him, "Of course it's true. Maybe Jason wants me to hurry up and find his killer."

Brandon nodded nervously and hurried upstairs.

Watching Brandon's terrified state, Savannah couldn't help but laugh.

"Ms. Sharp, look at him. If he hadn't done anything wrong, he wouldn't be so scared. He must have a guilty conscience."

I nodded, laughing along.

"Serves him right. He's so afraid of karma, yet he did such disgusting things. People like him are shameless."

Savannah nodded, "Exactly. He even tried to take your money. He should know his place."

Then Savannah's expression turned worried, "Ms. Sharp, now that Brandon knows about your urban renewal project in Suncrest City, do you think he might do something extreme? Money can turn people into beasts."

I shook my head, "It's fine. Brandon doesn't know the full extent of my assets, and my dad already gave me advice. I'm not afraid of him."

"Honestly, if Brandon hadn't hurt me and my child, I might have shared this wealth with him."

Savannah pursed her lips, "He'll regret it once he finds out. It just shows that even God doesn't want him to be rich."

We exchanged a look, and just then, my phone rang. It was Kelly.

She asked, "When are you coming back?"

I checked my flight details and said, "The flight is the night after tomorrow. I should land in Suncrest City the next morning."

I suddenly remembered something and added, "By the way, Mom, I'll be coming back with Brandon this time, so don't make it too obvious."

I glanced up the stairs. Brandon seemed to be in his room, not coming down, so I whispered, "Don't worry, I will definitely divorce Brandon, but he still controls a lot of my assets. I need to get those back first."

Kelly nodded, "Alright, I understand. Brett said he misses you today."

I smiled, thinking about my kids. I missed them too and wondered how many words they could say now.

"What are they up to?" I asked.

"They're all asleep. They were exhausted from playing all day," Kelly said with a laugh.

Imagining the scene made me feel incredibly happy.

"Mom, once everything here is settled, I'll come back and stay with you and the kids. We won't be apart anymore."

After hanging up, I couldn't help but smile.

Savannah looked at me and said, "It seems like Ms. Sharp only truly smiles when talking about her family."

I nodded, "Of course. Only with my mom do I feel at peace. After everything with Brandon, I trust no one else."

After saying goodnight to Savannah, we each went to our rooms.

Before bed, I decided to message Royce, just sending him my flight details.

Royce replied quickly, "Got it."

I felt a bit disappointed. I had hoped for more than just a curt response, but I reminded myself that Royce and I had no real relationship. He had no reason to care.

Putting my phone down, I prepared to sleep.

The next morning, I went downstairs to the living room.

Brandon was there, looking exhausted with dark circles under his eyes.

He looked at me and said, "Honey, how about we sleep together tonight?"

Since Brandon contracted syphilis, we had been sleeping in separate rooms.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

Brandon said, "I had nightmares all night and couldn't sleep. I tried to come to your room, but the door was locked."

Ever since I found out Brandon had poisoned me, I had made it a habit to lock my door.

I replied calmly, "I must have locked it by accident. Why didn't you knock?"

"I didn't want to disturb your sleep. You're not in the best health."

"We're leaving for Suncrest City tomorrow. Let's just get through tonight without any fuss."

###chapter 132

When I said that, Brandon, though reluctant, could only nod.

Around noon, Kathy suddenly called me and asked, "Hey, are you heading back to Suncrest City tomorrow?"

I thought to myself, Kathy's got some serious connections. Must've been Royce who spilled the beans.

"Yeah, I was gonna tell you before I got on the plane. What's up?"

Kathy replied, "Not much. I haven't seen Mrs. Sharp in a while, so I'll tag along this time."

I was surprised. Kathy had been swamped with a big project lately and hadn't been out with me for a while.

Every time she wanted to visit, I'd tell her to focus on her work. After all, this project could make or break her career as a top designer.

"Aren't you busy with work?"

"Don't worry, I'll be fine going back on my own. Savannah's with me, and my mom's at home. They won't dare cause any trouble."

"I've wrapped up my work. This project really fried my brain. I need a break, and it's a good chance to visit Suncrest City."

Seeing her insist, I nodded. "Alright, I'll see you in Suncrest City tomorrow."

"Cool, our flights will probably land around the same time. Oh, and Simon insists on coming too. It's so annoying."

I couldn't help but laugh. "Maybe he's coming for you."

Kathy scoffed, "Yeah, right. He's just looking for some fun."

After hanging up, I thought about this trip to Suncrest City. It was going to be quite the event, considering how many people were going. It was bound to be lively.

Savannah and I packed our things for the trip to Suncrest City. Without the kids' stuff, our luggage was much lighter.

Brandon, on the other hand, seemed terrified. He was still sitting on the couch, staring blankly ahead.

I walked over and urged him to pack his bags. "Aren't you going back to Suncrest City tomorrow?"

Brandon snapped out of his daze. "Yeah, yeah, I'm packing now."

But he kept getting distracted while packing, forgetting this and that, taking forever to finish.

I finally couldn't help but look over. He was holding a water cup, staring blankly at something. I called out, "Brandon!"

He jolted, dropping the cup, which shattered on the floor.

"What are you doing?"

Brandon forced a smile, looking quite pale. "I'm packing, honey. What's wrong?"

I sneered, knowing exactly why he was acting this way, but I didn't show it. "Where were you the past few days? Why have you been so out of it since you got back? Did some woman catch your eye again?"

Brandon finally realized what I was getting at. "Honey, you're overthinking. There's no other woman. I've just been preoccupied with work."

I kept staring at him. "What work?"

"Since I'm going to Suncrest City with you, there are some loose ends at the office. Honey, I know you're worried, but I'll handle it."

Worried about him? I scoffed internally. Who would worry about him?

"Fine, just hurry up and finish. If you can't, go a few days later."

Brandon shook his head. "It's fine. The tickets are already booked. I'll go with you. There's just a bit left to handle. I'll head to the office now, honey."

I nodded and didn't say more. After packing, Brandon went to the office and didn't come back until late.

The next morning, Brandon walked out of the room looking much better, as if he had shaken off the fear.

Soon, Leo rang the doorbell and brought Briar over.

Leo and Brandon exchanged polite greetings.

Briar was delighted to see Savannah and grabbed her hand.

Leo said to me, "Thanks, Caroline. If she misbehaves, just call me, and I'll scold her."

I nodded. "Don't worry. Briar doesn't seem like a troublemaker."

After Leo left, we had breakfast and headed to the airport.

When the plane landed, I saw Holly and Kelly in the distance, with a small figure beside them.

I couldn't help but quicken my pace. Brett saw me and ran over, jumping into my arms.

I almost didn't catch him. I patted his head. "Did you miss me, Brett?"

Brett nodded eagerly. "I missed you so much, Mom."

Brandon forced a smile and asked, "Did you miss Dad, Brett?"

Brett glanced at him, nodded, then buried his head deeper into my arms, clearly not very close to Brandon.

I comforted him for a while. He looked curiously at Savannah and Briar.

He hadn't seen much of Briar growing up and didn't know Savannah at all.

"This is Savannah, my friend. And this is Briar, your cousin. She'll be playing with you for a while, okay?"

Brett looked at Briar curiously, then reached out to hold her hand.

Kids make friends quickly, and soon they were playing together, running around the adults.

We walked over to Kelly. My mom was holding Aria, and Holly was holding Yves.

I felt a sense of peace. No matter what, I always wanted to be with my mom.

"Mom," Brandon called softly.

My mom responded well, nodding. "You're back. Let's go. I've prepared food at home."

I took Aria from my mom, and we all got in the car.

Just as we got home, Kathy called. Her voice was loud. "Caroline, I'm here. Where are you?"

I pointed the camera at the table full of food and laughed. "We're about to eat. Why are you so late?"

"Wait for me. I'm almost there. I just got off the plane. Save me some food."

I laughed. "Alright, alright. We'll save some for you."

Brandon frowned when he saw Kathy's video call. "Why is she coming too?"

I tilted my head slightly. "Why not? Kathy knew my mom before you did."

Brandon had nothing to say. "I'm just curious."

At the table, Eugene stood next to my mom, exchanging a glance with Brandon.

I didn't miss their exchange and sneered inwardly. I'll replace Eugene sooner or later.

###chapter 133

Brandon and Eugene exchanged a quick glance before looking away, like they were scared someone might catch on that they knew each other.

I watched their little act and couldn't help but smirk.

"So, Eugene, how do you know Brandon?" I asked, feigning curiosity.

The two, who had just been pretending not to know each other, froze. Eugene was the first to recover. "Mr. Jordan found me through a friend. He offered a good deal, so I came. Otherwise, I'd just be at home farming."

I nodded and looked at Brandon. "Gotta hand it to you. You did a good job. Eugene takes great care of my mom."

Kelly and I exchanged a knowing look.

Brandon cleared his throat nervously and smiled. "Of course. Your mom is like my mom. I had to find the best for her. I trust Eugene; otherwise, I wouldn't have let him take care of her."

Eugene nodded and smiled.

I pointed to an empty seat at the table. "Eugene, join us for dinner. It's rare for us all to be together like this."

Eugene quickly waved his hands. "No, no, I need to take care of Mrs. Sharp. You all eat; I'll eat later."

"That's not right," I insisted. "Eugene, you work so hard taking care of my mom. You should sit and eat with us."

Eugene hesitated, glancing at Brandon. When Brandon gave a barely noticeable nod, Eugene finally agreed and sat at the corner of the table.

I watched their interaction closely, smirking again.

Kelly looked at Briar with affection. "You must be Briar."

Briar, still a bit shy in our home, hid behind Savannah and nodded. "Hello, Grandma."

Kelly's face lit up as she reached out to ruffle Briar's hair. "This child is so different from Caroline when she was young. Caroline was always outgoing, but this quiet little girl is just as lovable."

I was taken aback and looked at my mom. "I wasn't like that. I was quiet too."

My mom laughed. "Sure, sure. You were so quiet, always climbing trees with the boys to steal bird eggs. Very quiet indeed."

Embarrassed by the old stories, I laughed awkwardly.

Savannah chuckled. "Ms. Sharp had a wild side as a kid?"

I waved my hand, not wanting to dwell on the past.

Halfway through our meal, we heard a knock at the door.

"Caroline, Mrs. Sharp, I'm here!"

I stood up, smiling. "That must be Kathy. Only she has such a loud voice."

Savannah and I went to open the door and took Kathy's luggage.

"You're late. We were about to finish eating."

Kathy rolled her eyes. "What? I told the driver to speed up so I wouldn't miss dinner. I haven't had Mrs. Sharp's cooking in years. I'm starving."

She hugged me and hurried into the living room.

"Mrs. Sharp!"

She was already shouting before she even got inside.

Kelly smiled helplessly. "Kathy, you're still as impulsive as ever."

Kathy laughed sheepishly and sat down next to Kelly without hesitation. "I've been craving Mrs. Sharp's cooking for so long. Finally, I get to eat it again."

My mom looked at Kathy lovingly. "Eat as much as you want. Eugene, get her some utensils."

Eugene got up to fetch them.

Brandon's expression soured at the sight of Kathy. They never got along.

After dinner, my mom had Eugene show us to our rooms.

She opened a pink-decorated room. "This is for Briar. I prepared it especially for her."

Briar's eyes lit up, clearly pleased.

Brett, not wasting any time, invited Briar to play hide-and-seek. We let the kids play and moved on to the next room, which was for Savannah.

"You'll stay next to Caroline. You two know each other well and can look out for each other."

Kathy followed us, eager. "What about me? Where do I stay?"

I looked at her. "Don't you have your own place in Suncrest City? Why stay here?"

Kathy rolled her eyes. "It's not the same. It's more fun here with everyone."

My mom smiled helplessly. "Kathy has always loved staying with us. Eugene, prepare a room for her."

Finally, we reached the room for Brandon and me.

My mom cleared her throat. "Brandon, you'll stay here."

Brandon, who had been silent, hesitated. "No, Mom. I'll stay with my wife."

"You should stay here. I want to sleep with the kids. I haven't seen them in so long. Just for a few days, okay?"

Seeing my determination, Brandon reluctantly agreed. "Alright, fine."

That night, we all went to our rooms. Kathy came to mine to chat.

Just then, Savannah entered with her phone, carefully closing the door behind her.

I knew she had news. She wouldn't close the door otherwise.

The kids were with Kelly and Holly, and Brandon was busy with work, so our room was safe for now.

Savannah showed us a video on her phone.

In the video, Karen was tied to a bed, screaming with her eyes closed, as if cursed. Several people were in the room, including Irene, a doctor, and Francis, who was filming.

Irene, looking annoyed, spoke to the doctor. "What's wrong with Karen? Why won't she stop? Her kids aren't here, and she's driving me crazy. Why can't she just die already?"

###chapter 134

The doctor looked at Karen with a serious expression and shook his head. "We've done a full body check-up on her. There's nothing wrong with her. In fact, her health is better than most people her age. But we can't figure out why she's suddenly running such a high fever."

"Has she been anywhere recently?" Irene asked impatiently, shaking her head. "How would I know? She's not my mom. She usually lives alone in that mansion. Brandon and Renee visit her occasionally, and then there's Earl. Who knows where he is now?"

I was taken aback. It seemed Irene didn't know where Earl was either, or that he was responsible for Jason's death.

As for why Karen was cursed this time, I wasn't sure. Could it be that she was scared when she went to the beach last time?

Karen lay on the bed, suddenly breaking free from the restraints and waving her hands as if trying to hit something.

"Earl, Earl," she mumbled, her consciousness fading.

Irene's face twisted with disgust. "Hurry up and do something! What's the point of you being here?"

A few nurses stepped forward to re-tie the restraints on Karen. Following the doctor's instructions, they administered a sedative, and Karen finally calmed down and fell asleep.

The room fell silent. After a moment, the doctor spoke. "What I'm about to say might go against my professional ethics, but Karen's symptoms don't seem like a regular illness. Maybe you should consider getting someone to perform an exorcism."

"An exorcism?" Irene frowned impatiently. "What a hassle."

With that, she stormed out of the room. Francis aimed the camera at Karen for a moment before turning it off.

Watching the video, Kathy couldn't help but exclaim, "Karen's cursed? I thought she was worse than a ghost. I didn't expect her to get cursed."

I sneered. "That's what happens when you do too many bad things. I'm surprised she only got cursed now. With all the terrible things she's done, she should've been dead 20 years ago."

Savannah and Kathy nodded in agreement.

"It seems Karen really likes Earl. Even when she's out of it, she's calling his name."

"No wonder Earl got promoted so quickly at the company. Karen's backing him. Brandon can't do anything about it, no matter how much he dislikes him."

"But Irene is just as two-faced. She acts all respectful to Karen but is abusive behind her back."

"That whole family is ungrateful."

"Irene was just a small-time accountant. If Karen hadn't insisted on giving her a job and bringing her into the company, she wouldn't be the CFO now."

"And when she almost got in trouble for embezzling company funds, I was the one who paid to settle it."

"Now she's complaining because Karen's cursed. She must've forgotten what her life was like before."

Kathy scoffed. "That family is full of bad people. Not a single good one among them."

I nodded in agreement.

Thinking back to Karen's condition, I suddenly had an idea. "Karen and Earl are so close. If he finds out she's in the hospital, do you think Earl will come to see her?"

Savannah's eyes lit up. "It's possible. Maybe we can use Karen to catch Earl."

I nodded and quickly called the police. "Hello, Officer. Sorry to bother you so late."

The male officer's voice was clear on the other end. "No problem. I'm on the night shift. What's going on?"

I explained, "Karen is in the hospital now. She and Earl are very close, so I think there's a chance Earl might come to see her. I suggest you have someone keep an eye on her room. You might find some clues."

The officer thanked me. "That's very helpful. I'll discuss it with my captain and have someone there first thing tomorrow."

I nodded. "Okay. I have someone watching Karen tonight. If Earl shows up, I'll make sure to stall him and call the police."

The officer thanked me again. "We appreciate it."

Kathy watched me finish the call and sighed. "Every day feels like a battlefield. It's chaos."

I couldn't help but laugh at her description. It was true.

Ever since I found out Brandon was drugging me, our family hadn't had a moment of peace.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. The three of us exchanged glances and fell silent.

I cleared my throat and asked, "Who is it?"

Brandon's voice came from outside. "It's me, honey."

I exchanged a look with Savannah and nodded for her to open the door.

Brandon walked in and was surprised to see the other two in my room. "Quite the gathering in here," he half-joked.

Kathy chuckled. "What, you want to join our girl talk?"

Brandon waved his hand. "No, I just wanted to chat with my wife. But since you're all here, I'll leave."

He turned and left without hesitation.

After he closed the door, I signaled to Savannah. She quietly opened the door a crack and watched Brandon's retreating figure.

Once she confirmed he had gone back to his room, she returned. "Do you think he heard anything?"

I shook my head confidently. "No, the house is pretty soundproof. Even if he heard something, it would just be muffled sounds. He wouldn't have made out any details."

"Since he came by, let's call it a night. I have things to do tomorrow morning. We'll talk about the rest later."

We all went our separate ways, and I lay down to sleep.

Back home, I felt much more at ease. I quickly fell asleep.

When I woke up in the morning, I felt refreshed and in good spirits.

I really should consider divorcing Brandon and moving back to Suncrest City. Since coming back, my sleep and overall health had improved significantly.

At breakfast, my mom mentioned taking the kids to the amusement park.

I nodded and asked Savannah to go with them. Kelly and Holly wouldn't be able to handle all four kids on their own.

###chapter 135

"Perfect timing, I've got some errands to run this morning too, so I won't be joining you guys."

Brandon looked at me, "Where you headed, babe?"

I tried to keep my face neutral, "Meeting an old friend. It's been a while, and I miss him."

Brandon stared at me, "Then I'll come with you."

I gave him a cold smile, "You're gonna meet my middle school friend with me? Don't you think it'll be awkward?"

"Come on, if you want to go, just take the kids to the amusement park with Mom. You're always busy with work, so take this chance to relax at home. I'm just grabbing a meal, I'll be back soon."

"Besides, our conversation would be awkward with you there. It's better if you don't come."

Hearing this, Brandon had no choice but to give up, "Alright, babe, come back early."

I nodded, and after finishing breakfast, I left the house once Kelly and the others had departed.

I drove Gerald's old car, so I wasn't worried about any tracking devices. I kept an eye on the rearview mirror, and sure enough, Eugene followed me in another car.

It seemed Brandon had sent him to tail me.

I smirked. I knew Suncrest City like the back of my hand. I could navigate its streets with my eyes closed. Eugene would have a hard time keeping up with me.

I deliberately took a series of winding, narrow roads, making sharp turns until I lost Eugene's car.

Seeing no sign of the tailing car, I chuckled, "You need a few more years of practice to follow me."

I drove straight to Asher's place.

I mainly came back to see him again.

I knocked on his door, and he quickly opened it, looking surprised, "What a coincidence! Did you two plan this?"

I was puzzled, "What do you mean?"

Asher stepped aside, revealing Royce sitting in the living room.

I stared at him in disbelief, "What are you doing here?"

Royce's voice was smooth and magnetic, "Can't I be here?"

I remembered how coldly he had responded to my message about my flight yesterday, yet here he was today.

I felt a mix of emotions and awkwardly nodded, "Sure, why not."

Avoiding Royce's intense gaze, I sat down on Asher's couch.

"How are you doing, Asher? I've been so busy lately, I haven't had a chance to visit. I just got back to Suncrest City and wanted to check on you."

Asher looked healthier, with a bit more weight on his face.

"I'm fine. All I do is eat and drink every day. It's boring."

"My health is back to normal, maybe even better. I spend my free time working out."

Hearing this, I felt relieved, "That's good. I was worried about you."

"By the way, Caroline, how are things on your end? Royce keeps me updated. How's the company situation?"

My expression grew serious, "We're at a critical point. Whether we can take Brandon down depends on these next few days."

Asher nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation, "Caroline, if you need anything, just let me know. I'm here for you."

I was touched and nodded. It was because of the support from people like Asher that I could keep fighting against Brandon. Otherwise, given my mental and physical state a while ago, I wouldn't have made it this far.

But we didn't need to say thank you. It would feel too formal.

"Asher, have you been in touch with your parents? Renee and Earl are missing now, so they probably won't be watching you like before. You can relax a bit."

Asher smiled, "I know. Royce told me. I secretly visited my parents recently. They're doing well. I told them I failed an investment and felt embarrassed to come back. They didn't say much, just that they're glad I'm home."

Hearing this, I felt relieved. Asher couldn't visit his parents because of me, and I had always felt guilty about it.

Asher seemed to sense my emotions and reassured me, "Don't worry, it's not your fault. Blame Brandon for being such a jerk."

"I know you're a victim too. Let's work together to take back the company."

I nodded.

Royce, who had been silent, finally spoke, "I've arranged everything at the company. Once Brandon takes the bait, taking over will be quick."

"Don't worry, with us, nothing will go wrong."

I nodded, "Of course, I trust you. Without you, I wouldn't have made it this far. I would have died in bed."

Royce and Asher fell silent at my words.

Seeing their expressions, I quickly smiled, "What are you doing? I'm fine now. We've all come a long way."

"Remember, I used to be confined by Brandon, unable to leave the house. Now I can come back home. Isn't that progress?"

Seeing their expressions soften, I smiled too.

We then discussed our plans against Brandon in detail.

After confirming our actions, I noticed it was getting late and said goodbye to Asher.

Just then, Royce followed me. I was surprised, "What are you doing?"

Royce raised an eyebrow, "I'm leaving too. Or are you stopping me?"

I was taken aback and stepped aside, "Go ahead."

But Royce stopped and looked at me, "I didn't drive. You give me a ride."

"You didn't drive?"

I was skeptical, "Then whose Cullinan is that downstairs? Don't tell me it's not yours."

Royce chuckled, his expression unchanged, "It's mine, but it broke down."

I tried to avoid being alone with Royce, "Call the insurance company. We're not going the same way."

I stepped into the elevator, intending to close the door quickly, but Royce slipped in.

"What's the big deal? Just give me a ride."

###chapter 136

I couldn't help but look at him helplessly. "Royce, how come I never noticed how shameless you are before?"

His eyes sparkled. "Guess you just haven't spent enough time with me. Stick around, you'll see."

I shut my mouth, realizing that no matter what I said, I couldn't win against him. I decided to drop the matter altogether.

When we got to the underground parking garage, I opened the car door and got in. The next second, Royce opened the passenger door and plopped down.

He gave me an address, indicating that he wanted me to drop him off there. "Thanks!"

With that, he waved at me lightly.

I rolled my eyes at him and stepped on the gas.

When we arrived at Royce's place, he didn't get out of the car but instead looked at me. "Want to come in for a bit?"

I hesitated. "Nah, I was planning to head home."

To my surprise, he said, "It won't take long. I have tea and coffee at home. I can offer you a drink."

His deep eyes stared straight at me, and somehow, I was bewitched by them. I nodded lightly. "Alright."

After getting out of the car, we left the underground parking and took the elevator up.

The narrow space with just the two of us made me a bit nervous, and I took a deep breath.

Unfortunately, the elevator was made of metal on all sides, so no matter where I turned, I could see Royce's face.

I suddenly felt that coming to his place was a bad decision.

But since I was already here, it didn't matter anymore.

As the elevator ascended slowly, my nerves gradually tightened, perhaps because we were getting higher.

Royce looked at me and chuckled. "Why are you nervous?"

I was taken aback and stubbornly said, "I'm not nervous. Why would I be?"

He laughed. "Your eyes say otherwise. What's there to be nervous about coming to my place?"

"Yeah, what's there to be nervous about? I'm just having a cup of coffee," I said, as if trying to reassure myself.

When the elevator stopped, Royce and I walked out and arrived at his apartment door.

The mailbox at the door was covered in dust, which made me curious. "You don't come back here often?"

Royce nodded lightly. "I only stay here when I'm in Suncrest City."

"But don't worry, I've had the place cleaned. It's not dirty inside."

Royce entered the code and opened the door. As I walked in, I noticed the entire apartment was decorated in black, white, and gray.

It suited Royce's personality perfectly. This was exactly how I imagined his place would look.

Royce reached out to touch me, and I instinctively dodged, asking in alarm, "What are you doing?"

Royce laughed. "Why are you so jumpy? I just wanted to help you take off your coat."

"Aren't you hot?"

I swallowed, thinking my reaction was over the top. "No, no, it's fine. I'll do it myself."

I put down my bag and hung my coat on the rack by the door.

Royce had me sit at the bar while he went to make coffee.

I had to admit, Royce looked particularly attractive in his casual clothes, with his sleeves rolled up to reveal his strong forearms.

He made coffee with smooth, practiced movements, clearly accustomed to doing this.

In no time, he brought a cup of coffee and placed it in front of me. "Give it a try."

I picked up the cup and took a sip. The bitterness and acidity hit my taste buds, followed by a rich aroma. Upon closer inspection, there was even a hint of fruity flavor, which was a pleasant surprise, like receiving an unexpected gift.

"These are the best coffee beans of the year. I bought them especially."

I nodded. "It's really good. You seem to know your way around making coffee."

Royce smiled. "Not just coffee. There are other things too."

I was puzzled and looked at him, not understanding what he meant.

He didn't elaborate, instead turning to make himself a cup and sitting across from me.

We drank our coffee in silence, but it wasn't awkward. In fact, I found the quiet atmosphere quite peaceful. I felt a sense of tranquility, making me want to abandon everything and hide in this environment.

I must be crazy.

After finishing my coffee, I checked the time. "I've finished my coffee. I should go."

Royce nodded and didn't try to stop me. Instead, he suddenly stepped forward.

Remembering the kiss in the hotel suite last time, I instinctively stepped back, watching him warily. "What are you doing?"

To my surprise, Royce just reached out and gently wiped my upper lip with his warm thumb.

"How did you manage to get coffee on your lips?"

My face turned red instantly, and I stepped back, wiping my lips myself. "Thanks, I'll be going now."

Royce offered to walk me out, but I declined, feeling that the atmosphere might become dangerous if we continued.

Fortunately, Royce didn't insist and watched me leave from inside.

Back in my car, I let out a deep breath. I didn't know what I was feeling, but there was a strange sense of loss. Maybe deep down, I didn't want to escape this feeling. I didn't want to go back to the scheming and deceit with Brandon, which made me feel lost. Or maybe it was something else. I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

After leaving Royce's place, I drove around Suncrest City for a while. I hadn't been back in years and hadn't seen the city's scenery in a long time. Suncrest City, known for its rich culture, had done a great job in tourism over the years. There were many tourists, and the old city had become quite commercialized.

I bought some snacks I loved as a kid and headed home.

Brett and the others hadn't returned yet, probably still at the amusement park.

Kathy had just woken up, looking sleepy. "You're back?"

I nodded. The next second, I saw Eugene come out of the kitchen. He glanced at me and then looked away. I figured he must have tried to follow me but lost track, so he came back home.

I smiled faintly and asked Eugene, "Where's Brandon?"

"Mr. Jordan is busy. He should be back soon. Do you need anything?"

I shook my head. "No, I was just wondering when dinner will be ready. I'm a bit hungry."

Eugene nodded. "Mrs. Sharp called and said they'll be back soon. I'll call Mr. Jordan, and we can start dinner."

I nodded and went to my room, shedding some of the heavy burdens, and lay on the bed, taking a deep breath.

###chapter 137

Before long, Kelly came back with the kids, and Brandon showed up too.

He didn't seem to notice anything different about me, probably clueless about where I'd been today.

Brett had a blast at the amusement park, and both he and Briar were sporting headbands from the park.

Excitedly, he showed me, "Mom, check out my headband! Isn't it cool?"

I nodded and smiled, "It looks awesome. Both yours and Briar's look great."

Brett hugged me, pouting playfully. "I had so much fun today. It's been forever since I had this much fun. You and Dad never had time to take me to the amusement park before."

"The only thing missing today was you, Mom. Can we go again when you and Dad aren't busy?"

Brett looked at me with hopeful eyes.

I glanced at Brandon, my tone hinting at something more, "Well, that depends on your dad. He's the busy one in the family now."

Brandon picked up Brett and chuckled, "No matter how busy I am, I'll always make time to take my kids out. That's a promise."

Though Brandon wasn't great at many things, he sure knew how to play the role of a good dad and husband. That's why I trusted him for so many years.

With everyone gathered, Eugene started bringing out the food, filling the table to the brim.

We sat down to eat. After a long day, I was pretty hungry.

After dinner, I felt like taking a walk to digest, so I asked Savannah to join me.

I wanted to bring Kathy along, but she said she needed to catch up on sleep after gaming all night.

Savannah and I teased her, saying only kids play games all night, and she was already in her thirties.

As Savannah and I headed out, we didn't notice Brandon and Eugene leaving too.

We strolled around Suncrest City, which looked stunning at night with its colorful lights making the old city feel vibrant and alive.

Savannah sighed, "I wonder what it's like growing up here. It must be wonderful."

I nodded. "Life here is slow-paced, with plenty of resources and a great climate. Most people choose to stay. It's rare for someone like me to move to another city."

"I must have been crazy back then."

I couldn't help but laugh at myself.

Savannah shook her head, "It wasn't your fault. Brandon tricked you. You were just too young to see through him."

Her serious expression made me laugh. "Alright, you're right."

We wandered around until it got late.

As we headed back, we passed by a yard next to my house and heard voices.

I knew the nearby yards belonged to my family and had been empty for a while, except for a few tenants and old neighbors. The voices were strange.

Savannah and I exchanged glances and moved closer to listen.

After a while, I recognized Brandon and Eugene talking.

"Has Mrs. Sharp shown any signs of anything unusual?" Brandon's deep voice asked.

Eugene shook his head. "No, she's been busy with the kids. But I do suspect something."

I leaned in, listening intently.

"What is it? Spill it!" Brandon urged.

"I think Mr. Sharp left more than one property. There might be other assets for Caroline."

Brandon's eyes lit up, and I could imagine his greedy expression.

"What do you mean?" he asked excitedly.

Eugene continued, "I saw some documents in Mrs. Kelly Sharp's room, including an urban renewal agreement for another property nearby. It seems Mr. Gerald Sharp bought another house. Combined, these properties could be worth a lot more now."

"I'm not sure if Mrs. Sharp told Caroline about this."

Brandon, thrilled by the news, quickly calmed down. "Mrs. Sharp probably didn't tell Caroline. If she knew, she would've told me right away."

Hearing his low opinion of me, I couldn't help but chuckle. Brandon was stuck in the past.

Just wait and see how I outsmart you.

I was also relieved that Brandon didn't know the full extent of my dad's assets.

"I've been a dutiful son-in-law for years, doing so much for them. And they didn't tell me about this? Caroline's family is truly ungrateful."

I laughed quietly. Brandon's words were both absurd and infuriating.

Who's really ungrateful here?

"Keep an eye on Mrs. Sharp. Inform me immediately if anything changes. I need to control that urban renewal money."

Hearing his determined tone, I couldn't help but sneer.

"By the way, I heard about someone named Castillo in a recording. Does he visit often?"

I was surprised. Despite not being around, Brandon knew everything happening here, even Royce's visit to see Kelly.

"Not often. I've only seen him twice. He's Caroline's classmate and has some connection with Mrs. Sharp. He visits once a year, stays briefly, and leaves."

Brandon nodded suspiciously. "He seems important. Keep a close watch on him."

"Do you think he has a relationship with Caroline?"

Brandon shook his head. "Caroline's always at home. They can't be close. I'm more concerned about any business he might have with Mrs. Sharp. Keep a tight watch on him."

I breathed a sigh of relief. Brandon didn't suspect Royce's identity or our relationship.

Though he had surveillance here, he couldn't monitor us all the time.

###chapter 138

The conversation in the yard continued as Brandon handed something to Eugene. "Here, take this."

Peeking through the crack in the door, I saw it was a bank card.

Eugene, usually so stoic, suddenly looked greedy. "Thanks, Mr. Jordan. Is this all for me?"

Brandon replied, "You've done a decent job so far. There's $200,000 on this card. Use it however you need."

It seemed Brandon was quite generous with Eugene, considering this spy lived in the house 24/7 without having to do much else.

Eugene thanked him profusely, "Thank you, Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Jordan. You're very generous."

"Do your job well, and there will be more money in the future," Brandon said, preparing to leave. Savannah and I were startled and about to run when Eugene suddenly asked, "By the way, Mr. Jordan, how's my niece Elora doing?"

"That kid lost her parents young, and I've been raising her. I've spoiled her a bit, so if she ever offended you, please forgive her. She never means any harm."

I was taken aback, not realizing Elora and Eugene had such a relationship.

It seemed Eugene considered Elora his own daughter, and he didn't even know she had jumped to her death.

If he found out, he would probably be devastated. But I could use this to my advantage.

Brandon snorted, "She's with me. What are you worried about?"

"Do you think I'd mistreat her?"

Eugene nodded repeatedly, "Of course, I'm not worried. It's just that I haven't been able to reach her for a few days, and I'm concerned about what she's doing for you."

"I don't mean anything by it. Just have her call me back. I'm worried about her."

"What's there to worry about?" Brandon said impatiently. "I sent her abroad on a job. The signal there is bad, so she can't call you."

"I'll have her call you as soon as she gets back."

Eugene nodded again, "I see, I see. Thank you for taking care of her."

"Since she started working for you, she's been doing better and better. We owe you a great debt."

I couldn't help but smirk. Why was Brandon hiding Elora's death? Was he involved? These questions remained unanswered.

Regardless of whether he caused her death, he was definitely connected to it. Eugene thanking him like a benefactor was painfully ironic.

And Elora's child, Jason, had also been harmed by the Jordan family. I wondered how Eugene would react if he knew everything.

And what would Elora, now in heaven, think if she saw this? Would she desperately want to come down and warn Eugene?

I didn't know. When Elora worked at my company, I had high hopes for her, grooming her as my successor.

If she had followed the right path and completed the tasks I gave her, her fate wouldn't have turned out like this.

But everything is a result of personal choices, and no one else can interfere.

Brandon, tired of Eugene's flattery, said, "Alright, I'm heading back. If Caroline comes home and sees I'm not there, it'll be trouble. Stay here for half an hour before you go back, so we don't run into each other."

Eugene nodded.

Then I heard footsteps in the yard, indicating Brandon was leaving. Savannah and I panicked, looking around for a hiding spot in the alley.

I was frantic, but Savannah quickly pulled me behind a trash can, shielding me there.

Brandon soon came out, looking around cautiously.

We were only a few feet away from him, and my heart was pounding.

I could feel Savannah's fingers gripping my shoulder tightly, her whole body tense, ready to spring into action if Brandon came closer.

Like a protective lioness, she crouched beside me.

We stared intently at Brandon, unsure if he sensed us, as he turned to look around.

But we were hidden in the shadows, and he couldn't see us.

Still, Brandon was very cautious. Even though he didn't see us, he decided to check behind the trash can.

We panicked, unsure what to do, hoping he wouldn't come closer. Any movement would give us away.

Just as he was about three feet away, the door to my yard opened, and Kathy came out. "Brandon, is Caroline back?"

Brandon turned back, momentarily distracted from our hiding spot.

"No, I'll call her in a bit."

"Okay, go ahead."

Brandon walked back, dialing my number.

I quickly put my phone on silent, knowing if it rang in the alley, we'd be exposed.

Thankfully, I silenced it just in time.

I exhaled deeply, drenched in cold sweat, and Savannah was equally tense, her forehead glistening.

We exchanged relieved glances.

Eugene was still in the yard, so we took the opportunity to knock on the door.

Brandon, still on the phone with me, looked surprised. "You're back? I was just about to call you."

He noticed my phone. "Why didn't you answer? It didn't ring."

I showed him my phone, the screen off. "It was off. Savannah and I saw it was getting late and decided to come back. We didn't want to be out too late and miss the streetlights. We were planning to grab a drink."

Kathy, standing behind Brandon, looked at us. "You two went out for drinks and didn't invite me?"

I looked at Kathy, smiling helplessly. "You said you wanted to catch up on sleep. How could I invite you?"

###chapter 139

Kathy stood with her hands on her hips, looking all smug. "Not inviting me and me not wanting to go are two different things. Even if I don't want to go, you still gotta invite me."

I couldn't help but laugh at her attitude and said, "Alright, alright, we didn't go this time. Next time, we'll definitely invite you."

As we talked, Brandon kept giving Savannah and me these suspicious looks. The timing of our return was a bit too perfect, and he seemed to be trying to figure out if we had overheard anything.

I took the initiative to wrap my arm around Brandon's and said sweetly, "Honey, I've been out all day and I'm exhausted. Can you give me a shoulder massage tonight?"

He looked down at me for a long moment before nodding. "Sure. You've had a hard day, babe. I'll go get some water ready for you to soak your feet."

Once I was sure he wasn't suspicious of me anymore, I finally felt relieved.

Savannah and I walked over to Kathy and said, "Thank goodness you saved us earlier. We were eavesdropping on Brandon and Eugene, and when he came out, we planned to hide behind the trash cans. But that jerk was too cautious and came over to check. If you hadn't called him, he would have found us."

Savannah, still shaken, patted her chest. "It was so close. Thank you, Ms. Patel. We were only a few feet away."

Kathy smiled. "I just had a feeling you two should be back by now. It was taking too long, and with Brandon and Eugene both out, I got worried and went out to check."

I grabbed her hand. "I'll definitely treat you to dinner. Whatever you want, it's on me."

Kathy's eyes sparkled. "In that case, I won't hold back. I want to eat at Elysian Table."

I laughed. "That's not holding back? That's being very polite! Alright, I'll treat you for a whole month."

The three of us laughed, feeling a weight lift off our shoulders.

Just then, the door opened again, and Eugene walked in.

We exchanged glances, and I asked Eugene, "What were you doing out so late? Why are you just getting back? My mom's already asleep."

Eugene had reverted to his usual calm demeanor. If I hadn't seen him taking money earlier, I might have believed him.

"I ate too much at dinner, so I went for a walk. But I didn't see Ms. Sharp or Ms. Faith."

He was trying to probe me. I chuckled. "Which street did you go to? We were just walking on Main Street and didn't see you."

Eugene didn't flinch. "I went to a side alley. It's normal not to see anyone there."

"Ms. Sharp, if you need anything else, let me know. I'm going to my room now. I'm getting old and a bit tired."

I nodded and watched Eugene head to his room.

It seemed Eugene was quite diligent, reporting everything to Brandon. I'd have to be more cautious around him.

But there was no way around it. Maybe I could consider turning him to my side.

Soon, Brandon brought me a basin of water for my feet. I sat on the couch.

He knelt on one knee, ready to wash my feet, but I refused.

Just being touched by him made me uncomfortable. Every time we had to act affectionate, I had to mentally prepare myself.

But Brandon seemed to enjoy putting on a show in front of others.

He knelt down, took my hand, and placed it in the water.

As he washed my feet, he said to Kathy and Savannah, "I used to wash my wife's feet all the time at home. She gets cold easily, and soaking her feet helps."

He effortlessly painted himself as a good husband.

But everyone present knew the truth about Brandon.

Kathy and the fake Savannah exchanged a glance and said, "You really are a good husband."

The sarcasm was thick, but Brandon didn't seem to catch it. He continued his task with even more enthusiasm.

I couldn't refuse, so I let him continue, treating him like an ordinary foot masseur.

I had to admit, Brandon's technique was decent. As he said, when we were dating, he often did these things for me, claiming he learned them willingly for his wife.

So he did have some skills.

Kathy and Savannah soon couldn't stand it anymore and said they were going to their rooms.

After saying goodnight, Brandon finished washing my feet.

He went to dump the water, and I prepared to go upstairs. But as soon as I started up, Brandon followed, clearly intending to enter my room.

His intentions were obvious, even a fool could see what he wanted.

Just as I was about to close the door, he slipped in. "Honey, it's been a while since we..."

He didn't finish, but I knew what he meant.

I pushed him out. "No, I'm too tired today."

But Brandon was persistent. "Just once, okay? A healthy sex life is important for our relationship."

I couldn't help but laugh coldly. He was worried about our relationship now? What about all the things he did to me before? Those were relationship killers.

I remembered what Savannah had told me recently. Brandon probably couldn't even get it up anymore.

So I smiled and invited him in. "Alright, come in then."

Once in my room, Brandon barely touched my shoulder before I recoiled in disgust. "You get ready on the bed. I'll take a shower."

He nodded, and I took my time in the bathroom. When I finally came out, Brandon was lying on the bed, looking defeated.

He looked at me and said, "Honey, wait a moment."

I nodded and watched him struggle for a while before he lay back, looking miserable.

He probably couldn't believe he couldn't get it up.

I looked at him sympathetically. "Are you too tired lately, honey?"

Brandon quickly nodded. "Yes, yes, I'm just too tired. That's it. We'll try again another time, okay, honey?"

I nodded, watching him hurriedly leave my room, clearly devastated.

I was curious. He just realized this problem now? It seemed he hadn't been with any women recently. With his untreated condition and all the chaos with Jason and Earl, he probably hadn't had the time.

From now on, he wouldn't be able to. The best way to deal with someone like him was to use this method.

###chapter 140

I couldn't help but marvel once again at how effective Royce's method was. It really hit Brandon's confidence as a man.

Before I lay down on the bed, I changed the sheets and duvet cover. Brandon had been lying on them earlier, and I just couldn't bring myself to use them again. I tossed them into the laundry basket outside and went back to sleep deeply.

After all, I was truly exhausted from running around all day. My body hadn't fully recovered yet, and although I felt more energetic, it was mainly because I was happy being at Kelly's place.

The next morning, when I went downstairs, no one was there.

Holly brought my breakfast to the table and told me, "Your mom took the kids to have lunch with her friend. Savannah went along to help Kelly, but they'll be back soon."

I nodded. I had slept way too long last night, and it was already close to 11 AM.

I finished my breakfast just as Brandon returned, carrying a hospital bag. I couldn't help but smirk, thinking about last night. It seemed Brandon was worried he might never be able to perform again, so he went to see a doctor. But no amount of medication would help him now.

Shortly after I finished eating, Savannah came back. She said, "Ms. Caroline Sharp, Mrs. Kelly Sharp said she's taking the kids for a nap and catching up with her friend over coffee and books. She'll be back in the afternoon, and I'll go pick them up then."

I nodded, "Thank you."

Savannah waved it off, "It's no trouble at all."

I stayed at home for a while and suddenly remembered the share agreement Gerald had left me. I hadn't visited that company yet.

Just then, Brandon got a call and rushed out, saying he wouldn't be back for dinner. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to check out the company, so I signaled Savannah to come with me.

"You don't need to pick up my mom this afternoon. Let Holly do it. You come with me."

We headed out together.

We arrived at the company, which was also in Suncrest City and dealt in building materials. It was quite large, about twice the size of my own company. Gerald had invested in it before it took off, so his share was significant.

I called the company's general manager, and he quickly came down to greet me. As I sat in the lobby drinking coffee, I suddenly heard a familiar voice.

"Get your manager down here now! Do you know who I am?"

"I'm here to discuss a partnership. If you don't get him, he'll regret it!"

I raised an eyebrow and saw that it was indeed Brandon. Savannah looked worried and asked, "Ms. Sharp, what should we do now?"

I shook my head slowly, "Let's wait."

Even if we left now, Brandon would still see us. Running away would only make us look suspicious. It was better to stay put. If he saw us, so be it. If not, no harm done.

Soon, the general manager came down and saw Brandon causing a scene. He asked the security guard, "What's going on?"

The receptionist explained, "This gentleman claims to be from a building materials company in Skyview City and insists on meeting you without an appointment. We couldn't let him in, and security couldn't stop him."

The manager glanced at Brandon and said, "I'm sorry, sir. If you want to discuss a partnership, please make an appointment. I have an important guest to meet now. Could you please leave?"

Brandon, perhaps still upset from last night, was furious. "Do you know who I am? How dare you ask me to leave? You'll regret missing this deal!"

The manager, now irritated, pointed at Brandon and said, "I don't care who you are. We only welcome polite and respectful partners here."

He then instructed security to escort Brandon out.

Brandon refused and caused a commotion at the door. At that moment, the manager noticed me and Savannah sitting on the couch and hurried over, "Ms. Sharp?"

I nodded and extended my hand, "Mr. Ward, nice to meet you. My father spoke highly of you."

To be polite, I stood up, and sure enough, Brandon noticed me and exclaimed, "Caroline? What are you doing here?"

This was the last thing I wanted, but there was no avoiding it now. I looked at Brandon and said, "That gentleman is my husband. Let him in."

Mr. Ward instructed security to release Brandon, who stormed over and demanded, "What are you doing here?"

I remained calm and replied, "My father left me shares in this company. I arranged to meet Mr. Ward to discuss them."

"Shares?" Brandon asked, stunned. "Why didn't you tell me?"

I glanced at him, "You didn't tell me you were coming here either. What right do you have to question me?"

Brandon stammered, "I was trying to secure a deal for our company in Suncrest City. I heard Mr. Ward is usually very busy, so I came without an appointment."

I looked at him indifferently, "Mr. Ward, shall we go for lunch? This little incident was unexpected."

Mr. Ward nodded, "No problem, I understand."

As we walked out, I glanced at Brandon, "Stop embarrassing yourself and go home."

But Brandon insisted on tagging along, "Honey, I'll join you for lunch."

I couldn't argue with him in front of everyone, so I let him follow. It was purely by chance that he discovered I had shares in the company. But there was nothing he could do about it. He couldn't just take the shares from me. I wasn't the same person he used to drug and keep in a stupor.

###chapter 141

Carl drove his own car, while Brandon insisted on riding with me. We were heading to the restaurant together.

In the car, Brandon stared at me intently. "How much did Dad leave you? Why didn't I know about the shares in this building materials company?"

He was aggressive. "Do you still consider me your husband? Why didn't you tell me about this?"

I glanced at him calmly. "Why are you in such a rush?"

"I only found out recently. I wanted to check out the company's progress first. If it wasn't doing well, I planned to sell the shares and reinvest the cash into our company."

"I didn't expect to see you here."

Hearing this, Brandon's expression softened a bit. "You should have discussed it with me. If I had known you were a shareholder, I wouldn't have been looked down upon today."

I scoffed. "Who told you to be so reckless? If you had talked to me beforehand, this wouldn't have happened."

Brandon felt guilty. He had come here behind my back, so naturally, he didn't dare to tell me.

Similarly, I hadn't told him about my shares either.

The car was silent for a while. Suddenly, Brandon leaned in and asked, "How many shares do you have in this company?"

I knew there was no point in hiding it; Brandon would find out anyway. So, I decided to be honest. "Not much. My dad left me about 30%."

Brandon's eyes widened with excitement. "Honey, do you know how much 30% is worth? This company went public a couple of years ago. Do you know its market value?"

"If you sell all of it and invest in our company, we could expand production."

I looked at him. "I haven't decided whether to sell or not, and you're already spending the money?"

"Besides, my dad's letter said this money was for me personally. Even if I sell it, it's my decision whether to invest it in the company. Can you stop being so possessive about my money?"

Brandon gave a sheepish smile. "I'm just trying to give you some advice, honey. I didn't mean anything by it. Whatever you decide, I'll support you."

I glanced at him without saying a word.

His intentions were clear as day.

The car soon arrived at a restaurant. Carl had reserved the entire place, and a waiter led us into the empty restaurant.

As we opened a private room door, I saw a familiar figure inside.

Royce was sitting there, wearing a black coat, looking intently at his phone.

His silver watch added to his sophisticated look.

Brandon paused, likely recognizing Royce. After all, if he had investigated Royce, he would know what he looked like.

Carl greeted us warmly. "Let me introduce you. This is our CEO, Mr. Castillo. He insisted on joining us for dinner when he heard I was meeting with Ms. Sharp."

"By the way, Mr. Castillo is also from Suncrest City, so he and Ms. Sharp should have a lot in common."

I nodded. "Yeah, Royce and I go way back. He was close with my parents."

I extended my hand to Royce. "Long time no see. Last time I was in Suncrest City, you came over for dinner."

Brandon already knew about my history with Royce, so there was no point in hiding it. I decided to be upfront.

Royce chuckled and adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Long time no see, Ms. Sharp."

He glanced behind me at Brandon. "And this is?"

"My husband, Brandon."

Brandon immediately stepped forward and extended his hand to Royce. Although he didn't know Royce's full background, he had heard of him and knew he was a significant investor.

"Mr. Castillo, nice to meet you. I'm Brandon, the current general manager of BlueSky Building Supplies."

Royce looked at Brandon's hand for a moment before lightly shaking it and quickly letting go.

Brandon noticed the slight and his face darkened, but he held back, aware of Royce's influence.

After we all sat down, Brandon didn't give up and tried to engage Royce. "Mr. Castillo, what made you want to invest in this company?"

Royce glanced at me. "It was actually because of Mr. Sharp. When I returned to Suncrest City, I wanted to invest in local businesses. Mr. Sharp told me the building materials industry was a rising star and would have great potential. So, I invested in this company without hesitation."

"Mr. Sharp invested alongside me. Looking back, he was right. His foresight was impressive."

Royce's words brought back memories.

Gerald was a shrewd businessman who always told me to make money ethically and not to profit at the expense of others.

I learned a lot from him.

Even though he's gone now, his influence on me remains strong.

Brandon smiled. "It seems Mr. Castillo and my dad had the same vision. Otherwise, you wouldn't have invested in the same company."

Royce nodded, not committing to anything.

This was Brandon and Royce's first meeting.

I believed they would meet more frequently in the future.

Until I finally took back my company and made Brandon pay the price.

As we started eating, none of us touched our utensils much, except for Brandon, who ate happily while discussing the future of the building materials industry.

Carl frowned slightly but said nothing, clearly displeased with Brandon's boasting.

Brandon was in the middle of his enthusiastic speech when Royce suddenly stood up. "Excuse me, I need to use the restroom."

With Royce gone, Brandon had no one to talk to and fell silent.

At that moment, I received a WhatsApp message from Royce: "Come out."

I glanced at Brandon, who was too busy chatting with Carl to notice my phone.

I patted Brandon's shoulder. "I need to use the restroom too."

Brandon immediately looked at me. "Do you want me to go with you?"

I shook my head, smiling. "No, I'll be fine. Just keep Carl company."

He nodded, albeit reluctantly, and I slipped out of the room. I found Royce waiting for me in the hallway, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.

"What's up?" I asked, trying to keep my voice casual.

Royce straightened up and looked at me seriously. "We need to talk. There's something you should know about Brandon and his plans for the company."

I raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"

Royce sighed. "Let's just say, he's not as loyal to you as you think. He's been making some moves behind your back."

My heart sank, but I kept my expression neutral. "Tell me everything."

Royce nodded. "Let's find somewhere more private to talk."

We walked down the hallway to a quieter corner of the restaurant, where Royce began to explain everything he knew about Brandon's underhanded dealings. As he spoke, I felt a mix of anger and determination building inside me.

It was time to take control and make sure Brandon faced the consequences of his actions.

###chapter 142

I shook my head and said, "No need."

I gave Savannah a look, then glanced at Brandon, signaling her to keep him occupied.

Savannah immediately got the hint, nodding slightly at me. Only then did I feel comfortable enough to leave.

I didn't see Royce in the restroom, but then he texted me: "Outside."

I pushed open the restaurant door and stepped out. Royce was standing under a tree, smoking and looking at the street.

"Why'd you call me out here?"

Royce looked at me and chuckled, "Aren't you tired of listening to him brag about you?"

I nodded, "Yeah, but isn't it rude to leave Carl and Savannah behind?"

"What's the big deal? They can come out too."

I couldn't help but laugh at his logic.

"Do you actually have something to say, or can I go back now?"

I turned to leave, but he grabbed my wrist. "Wait, keep me company for a bit."

I turned back and saw the streetlights reflected in Royce's eyes, looking at me intently. It was hard to refuse.

After thinking for a moment, I nodded, "Alright, but only for half an hour."

After all, being in the restroom for more than half an hour would be suspicious.

I glanced at my wrist and then looked up at Royce's face. He seemed completely at ease, not finding anything wrong with holding my hand.

I finally reminded him, "Aren't you forgetting something?"

I gave him a hint with my eyes, but Royce just said, "Nope, I did it on purpose."

I was speechless. I tried to gently pull my wrist away, but he held on tight.

After a moment, I decided to let him hold my hand.

He led me across the street. The scenery felt oddly familiar, but I couldn't place it.

"Where are we?"

I asked, curious.

Royce glanced back at me, "You don't recognize it?"

I shook my head honestly. Royce seemed a bit annoyed and let go of my hand.

I didn't understand why he was suddenly upset. Suncrest City is huge; it's normal not to know every place. Why was he overreacting?

I decided not to cater to his mood and continued following him silently.

We turned into a familiar alley, and I saw a few small shops. Suddenly, it hit me.

This was near my high school.

But it had changed so much that I didn't recognize it.

As we walked out of the alley, I saw my high school campus. I got excited and asked, "This area has changed so much. There weren't this many tall buildings before."

Royce glanced at me, "Carl booked the restaurant. As soon as I arrived, I knew where we were."

"Unlike you, forgetting things so easily."

His tone was sarcastic. "Royce, seriously? Why are you so petty?"

"I just didn't recognize the high school. You're not my teacher, why do you care so much?"

He looked a bit hurt and fell silent.

I walked into a familiar shop, but most were closed for the holidays.

A few food stalls were open, and I excitedly bought a few things.

But they didn't taste the same as when I was younger, just like how the area looked different from my memories.

We walked out of the alley and reached the high school gate. I looked at the new buildings and felt nostalgic. "It's really different now."

Back then, Royce and I dated in this school. After school, my parents would pick me up, and we'd let go of each other's hands at the gate.

If my parents didn't come, he'd hold my hand and walk me home. Those walks were the happiest times.

But it had been a long time since I felt that way.

Royce stared at the school for a while, probably remembering those days too.

He reached out and grabbed my hand.

I was startled, "What are you doing?"

Royce said, "Didn't you say things are different now? Let me show you that some things are still the same."

He held my hand and walked down the path we used to take home.

I wasn't sure what he meant-if he was the same or something else...

I let him hold my hand for a long time before realizing, "Shouldn't we head back?"

Royce looked at me, "I just wanted to show you that nothing has really changed."

My cheeks turned red, and my heart pounded, ready to burst from my chest.

I didn't know how to respond, so I just nodded.

He smiled and held my hand tightly as we walked back.

Halfway, Brandon called me, "Honey, where did you go? You've been gone a while. Weren't you just going to the restroom?"

He heard the traffic noise and asked, "Did you go outside?"

I glanced at Royce, his eyes focused ahead.

"Yeah, this is near my old high school, so I came to see if I could find some of my favorite snacks."

"By the way, have you seen Mr. Castillo? He hasn't come back."

I looked at our clasped hands and thought, "He's right here." "Mr. Castillo is with me. Did you forget? We were high school classmates."

"Mr. Castillo reminded me this was our high school area, so I came to check it out. I'll be back at the restaurant soon."

Brandon finally hung up.

In front of the restaurant, I gently wiggled my fingers, and Royce understood, letting go of my hand.

I avoided his gaze and hurried inside.

Back in the private room, the warmth made my blush even more noticeable. I took a deep breath.

Brandon stared at me, "Honey, why is your face so red?"

I instinctively touched my face, "It's cold outside. The temperature's pretty low."

I handed him some snacks I bought, "Here, try some of our high school flavors."

Brandon took them, and just then, Royce walked in.

"I have to go. This meal's on me. Sorry to leave early."

###chapter 143

After Royce left, the dinner party quickly broke up. I said goodbye to Carl and headed home with Savannah and Brandon.

Once we got home, Brandon went straight to the study to take a call, while Savannah pulled me aside.

After making sure Eugene hadn't followed us, she whispered, "Ms. Sharp, something's happened to Karen."

I was shocked and looked at her in disbelief. "Karen? What happened to her?"

Savannah took out her phone and showed me a video of Karen being wheeled into the ICU.

Irene was standing behind, watching Karen without offering any help, her disdain clear.

I was stunned and asked, "What happened? How did she end up in the ICU in just one day?"

Savannah explained, "After that scare the other night, she's been having nightmares every day. Her mental state deteriorated, leading to a brain hemorrhage. Now she's in the ICU for treatment."

"I think Brandon's call was about this. Our people informed me around the same time Brandon got the news."

"I suspect Brandon will need to return to Skyview City soon to see his mom."

I nodded solemnly. "We planned to execute our plan after this vacation, but it looks like we'll need to move it up."

Savannah agreed. "Yes, we'll need to move it up. But don't worry, once we're in Skyview City, Brandon will be too preoccupied with his mom and our plan to keep up. It'll be easier for us to succeed."

I nodded, feeling reassured. "With you all, I have absolute confidence."

Sure enough, Brandon came out of the study looking very upset after his call.

I watched him sit on the couch and smoke, not approaching him.

Just then, Savannah told me someone was looking for me.

I glanced at Brandon, who didn't notice us, and followed Savannah outside.

To my surprise, Simon was waiting in the alley.

Kathy had mentioned Simon would come, but I hadn't seen him and thought she was mistaken. Turns out, she was right.

I asked him, "Where have you been these past few days?"

Simon hushed me and led us to a nearby hotel.

"This isn't the place to talk. Let's go."

He took us to a room upstairs, where Asher and Royce were chatting.

Simon brought us in.

Another person was there, focused on a computer, wearing thick glasses-clearly a tech expert.

Royce had mentioned something about coming here. I looked at them. "What are you doing?"

Simon said, "Remember the video I recorded of Karen and Brandon praying? I decided to post it online to pressure Brandon."

I nodded. I had thought of this before, but the timing hadn't been right, so the video was shelved.

"Now's the perfect time. Go ahead."

Royce asked, "Did you hear about Karen?"

I nodded. "Yeah, Savannah showed me the video. It looks serious."

Royce nodded. "Yeah, so Brandon will likely head back to Skyview City."

I nodded again.

Meanwhile, Simon and the tech guy started uploading the video.

The tech guy boosted the video's visibility, adding more clips of Karen's frightened, delirious state in bed. It quickly went viral.

The official report said Jason drowned, but Karen and Brandon's late-night visit to the beach, coupled with Karen's current state, sparked massive interest.

People love real-life horror stories.

The video exploded online, igniting widespread discussion. Everyone speculated about Jason's death and Karen's fear.

Reporters soon swarmed the hospital where Karen was admitted, trying to get interviews.

The hospital had to issue a statement saying Karen was in the ICU and not to disturb her.

This only fueled the public's excitement. If Karen was in the ICU, Jason's death must have been unjust, and he returned as a vengeful spirit.

Conspiracy theories flooded the internet, claiming Jason was murdered and returned to haunt Karen.

I found the idea laughable, but it was an effective way to spread rumors quickly.

Royce and Asher discussed their plans to return to Skyview City, while Simon and the tech guy managed the online narrative.

I ordered some fruit and food for them. "Take your time. Savannah and I need to go before Brandon gets suspicious."

They thanked me, and Savannah and I returned home. Fortunately, Brandon didn't ask where we had been; he was too overwhelmed by the online frenzy.

But Eugene did ask what we had been up to. I almost forgot we had a live-in spy.

I brushed him off and went to find Kathy.

Since coming to my house, Kathy had been relaxing, only coming out for meals and occasional chats.

I told her what I had been doing and Eugene's suspicious questioning.

Kathy nodded seriously. "We can't keep him around for long."

I agreed and shared my plan. "I intend to turn him. I have leverage over Eugene-he cares about Elora. If I use that, it shouldn't be too hard."

Kathy nodded. "But he's unreliable. Even if you turn him, he might betray us later."

"I know."

"If necessary, I'll personally send him to prison."

###chapter 144

Kelly was putting the three kids down for a nap.

I quietly slipped into the room to check on Brett, who woke up instantly and reached out to me. "Mommy, hug."

My heart melted immediately. I went over and scooped Brett up. "Did you have fun with Grandma these past few days?"

Brett, still sleepy, rubbed his eyes with his little fists but managed a smile. "Yeah, I had so much fun. I love playing with Grandma."

Seeing him like this filled a part of my heart. "So, did you have more fun with Grandma or with me?"

Brett's tiny face scrunched up as he pondered the question, clearly finding it difficult. After a while, he said, "I have fun with both Grandma and you!"

I chuckled and ruffled his hair. "You're already smart enough to keep everyone happy, huh?"

Brett understood what I meant and giggled.

"Mom, are you going out again later?" he asked.

I shook my head. "No, why?"

"I want you to play a game with me. Grandma bought me lots of toys, but no one plays with me except her. Ms. Patel sometimes plays with me, but she's usually asleep during the day."

I glanced at Briar, who was still asleep. "What about Briar? Why don't you play with her?"

"Briar's games are boring," Brett pouted.

I gently tapped his pouty lips. "That's because the games you want to play are too rough."

"Briar sits quietly and plays with her dolls, but you run around with a toy gun looking for someone to play fight with. Who wants to play like that?"

Brett pouted even more. "Then can you watch cartoons with me, Mom? I won't play games."

I nodded. "Sure, let's watch cartoons."

I carried Brett to the couch and turned on the TV. Just then, Holly brought us a plate of fruit and a glass of milk.

I quickly apologized. "Holly, I'm sorry to trouble you with this."

Holly smiled. "It's no trouble at all. You all treat me well, so I want to do the same. It's mutual."

"And besides, I've gained some weight staying with Mrs. Sharp. I need the exercise to lose some of it."

I accepted her kindness and patted Brett's head. "Brett, thank Mrs. Waverly."

Brett took a piece of fruit and smiled sweetly. "Thank you, Mrs. Waverly."

Holly was clearly charmed by Brett. "Ms. Sharp, you're so lucky to have such a sweet child."

I nodded sincerely. Since having Brett, I've been grateful every day. Thankful that I have such a well-behaved and understanding child.

But I couldn't help feeling a pang of guilt for not giving him a good father and bringing him into a broken family.

Holly seemed to understand my thoughts. "Ms. Sharp, don't overthink it. For Brett, having you might be enough. You don't need to feel guilty."

"And he has Grandma's love, and the love of all of us around him."

Her words reassured me, and I nodded, thanking her earnestly. "Thanks, Holly."

After dinner, Briar and Brett couldn't sit still and ran up and down the street, while Kelly and Holly took the other two kids for a walk.

I've noticed that Kelly's spirits have lifted a lot recently. Before I brought the kids back, he only had Eugene for company, and they barely spoke a word all day.

The house felt cold and empty.

But now, with all the kids back, and me, Savannah, and Kathy living here, mealtimes have become lively.

And my mom's smiles have noticeably increased.

I've decided to handle things with Brandon, get the divorce, and move back to Suncrest City to be with Kelly every day.

That evening, Kathy woke up and came to my room to play poker.

I pointed to Savannah and myself. "We need one more player."

"Isn't Mrs. Sharp around? Or Holly?"

"They're out with the kids. It's just us two."

We pointed upstairs to the study.

That person was Brandon.

Kathy immediately made a face. "No way, I'd rather play solitaire. Come on, let's play."

As we sat down, our conversation drifted.

Kathy and I started gossiping about Savannah's love life. "There must have been some handsome guys in the army. Didn't you like any of them?"

Savannah's face turned a bit red, which was a clear sign. Kathy and I exchanged glances, intrigued. "Come on, spill. Who did you like?"

Savannah hesitated but finally said, "There was one, our training team leader."

"He trained our female squad when I first joined. I had a bit of a crush on him. After training, we still saw each other around the base, but never had a chance to talk."

I shook my head, seeing how deep she was in. "No way, you must have seen him again. Otherwise, you wouldn't look like this."

Savannah blushed even more. "We met on the day I left the army. He gave me his contact info and said he'd like to meet up for dinner when he's on leave."

Kathy and I exchanged looks and squealed. "That's definitely a sign he likes you!"

"Why else would he ask you out for dinner? He didn't ask us."

"Really? I thought he was just bored and wanted company. Do you think he likes me?"

Savannah looked a bit troubled.

"But now that I'm out of the army, we can't see each other often. Even if he likes me, he might find someone else. And if we date, it'll be long-distance. How will that work?"

Kathy and I exchanged glances and chuckled. "Savannah, aren't you overthinking? You haven't even held hands yet!"

###chapter 145

"You haven't even held hands yet, and you're already thinking about the next step. Have you planned out your future kids too?"

Kathy and I burst into laughter.

Savannah looked a bit embarrassed. "Stop making fun of me. I've never been in a relationship before, and now I've met someone I really like, so of course, I'm thinking a lot."

I pointed at Kathy. "Well, you should ask Kathy then. She's got absolute confidence when it comes to catching a guy."

Savannah turned to Kathy, who immediately flipped her hair with a smug look. "Let me tell you, you have to keep a guy on his toes. Be sweet and caring, then pull back a bit. When he starts wondering why you're distant, he'll get more interested. Keep him guessing, and soon enough, you two will be together."

Seeing Savannah's attentive expression, I couldn't help but stifle a laugh. "That's the wrong way to do it."

Savannah was taken aback. "Huh?"

Kathy lightly slapped my arm. "What are you talking about? That's the right way. I've used this method to catch plenty of guys."

"Listen to me. Text him now and see if he replies."

Savannah checked the time. "It is their break time, so he might have his phone."

Kathy got excited. "Quick, quick, text him."

"Just ask, 'What are you up to?'"

Savannah hesitated and looked at me. I nodded. "Give it a try. Otherwise, with your slow pace, who knows when you'll move to the next step. Don't you want to be with your instructor?"

Savannah nodded firmly. "Of course I do. I'll text him now."

She took out her phone and typed a few words in her instructor's message box, then sent it.

He replied almost instantly: "Just finished training, waiting in line to shower and rest."

Kathy immediately patted Savannah's shoulder excitedly. "See? He definitely likes you. Otherwise, he wouldn't reply so fast. It's late, and he's a soldier with limited phone time. If he replies to you instead of relaxing, it means he likes you!"

Savannah panicked and handed her phone to Kathy. "What should I reply?"

Kathy waved her hand. "Don't reply yet. Let him start the conversation."

Kathy's method was indeed experienced. Soon, the guy texted back: "What about you?"

Kathy instructed Savannah. "Now you reply, 'Thinking about you.'"

Savannah hesitated. "Isn't that too obvious? What if he rejects me? Maybe I shouldn't."

Kathy looked exasperated. "Do you know better, or do I? Trust me, I won't let you embarrass yourself."

After some hesitation, Savannah sent the message.

Sure enough, the message box showed he was typing, but no message came through for a while.

Savannah stared at Kathy. "What now? I told you he doesn't like me."

Kathy rolled her eyes. "You're overthinking. He's probably too excited to type properly."

"Listen to me. Now text him, 'I miss you guys. Life outside isn't as good as in the unit.'"

I couldn't help but laugh and gave Kathy a thumbs up. "Your tactics are both offensive and defensive."

Kathy raised an eyebrow proudly. "Watch and learn."

Savannah followed Kathy's advice and sent the message.

This time, there was no typing indicator for a long time. Finally, he replied: "Okay."

Savannah looked at us in a panic. "Is he mad? Why did he just say 'okay'?"

I chuckled. "Even I can see what he means. How can you not?"

"He probably thought he misunderstood you and is now a bit disappointed."

Savannah was stunned for a moment. "What should I reply?"

Kathy said, "Don't reply anything else. Just say goodnight and talk tomorrow. If I'm right, he'll text you first tomorrow."

Savannah hesitated but followed Kathy's advice, saying goodnight. There was no further reply from him.

Kathy raised her eyebrows proudly. "After today, he's definitely hooked. This guy likes you, or he wouldn't reply like that. With my experience, you'll have him in a few months."

Savannah blushed. "I wasn't really thinking..."

"Come on, your face is so red. If you didn't want to be with him, why are you blushing? Do you want to see him marry someone else?"

Savannah shook her head. "Of course not."

"Then work hard to win him over. That way, no one else can take him."

I watched Savannah's earnest expression and sighed inwardly. Another innocent girl led astray by Kathy.

After we finished our card game, we all went to bed.

The next morning, Brandon knocked on my door early.

"Honey, Mom's in trouble. I need to go back to Skyview City."

Seeing Brandon's anxious face, I pretended to be worried. "What happened? Do you need my help? I know some good doctors. What's wrong with her?"

Brandon shook his head. "Not sure yet. Don't worry, honey. Just wait for me here."

"Irene called and said it's urgent, so I have to go back now. I'll come back to you as soon as I can."

I nodded. "Alright, I'll book your ticket. Go tell Kelly and the others."

Brandon turned and left. I watched his back and smirked.

Brandon, welcome to the trap I've set for you. From now on, you'll be walking into a never-ending nightmare.

This is the first day of our battle, and the countdown to your defeat.

I booked his flight for that afternoon.

Brandon told my mom and said goodbye, then packed his things and left in a hurry.

Meanwhile, Savannah's contact at the hospital reported, "Karen is in the ICU and not doing well. No one knows what's wrong."

"It seems she's having nightmares again, and the sedatives aren't working. So Irene had to call Brandon back."

###chapter 146

After seeing Brandon off, Carl told me I needed to attend the shareholders' meeting at his company.

Since I now own 30% of the company, making me the largest shareholder, I naturally have the right to attend.

I changed into appropriate attire and headed over. Carl's people led me to the door of a conference room, and I could hear the commotion inside even from the hallway.

One voice stood out, saying, "What makes Caroline qualified to be the major shareholder? Isn't it just because of what her dad left her?"

Another chimed in, "How embarrassing is it for us to be under her? We should band together and get rid of Caroline. What experience does she have to hold such a position?"

Carl's voice cut in, "That's not right. If it weren't for Mr. Sharp's investment, we wouldn't be where we are today. Isn't it only fair that he left assets to his daughter?"

"You're all not young anymore. Why are you picking on a young woman?"

"Now that he's dead, should his shares still hold sway over our company? Besides, Mr. Castillo is here, and he has also significantly helped us. I disagree with ousting her. Let's see what Mr. Castillo has to say."

I raised an eyebrow. Mr. Castillo must be Royce.

It made sense; today was the shareholders' meeting, so he should be here.

Royce calmly said, "You don't need to consider my opinion. Feel free to express your thoughts."

With Royce's apparent neutrality, some felt emboldened to speak more freely.

"I say we take this opportunity to swallow up Caroline's shares. What does a young girl know about business?"

"We've all been in the business world for years. How can we be content being under a young girl?"

Of course, there were also those who spoke up for Gerald: "That's not fair. If it weren't for Mr. Sharp, would this company be where it is today?"

"If it weren't for Mr. Sharp and Mr. Castillo's investments, our company would have collapsed long ago. You've all received substantial dividends over the years. Now that Mr. Sharp is dead, you turn your backs on him?"

"You're just grateful for a bit of money."

"Do you think Gerald invested in this company out of pure intentions? Look at the urban renewal in Old Town. He bought up so many properties, all left to his daughter. He even left her a construction company in Skyview City."

"Gerald just wanted to save more money for his daughter. Who knows what else is behind this? You're the only one foolish enough to speak up for him."

I chuckled softly, listening to the heated discussion without entering the room.

I wanted to hear what else they had to say.

"Everyone's getting off track. We're here for a shareholders' meeting, not to bash the Sharp family."

"I've been dissatisfied with the Sharp family for a long time. I support impeaching them."

"I disagree. The Sharp family has done a lot for us."

As the discussion grew more intense, I suddenly pushed the door open and walked in.

Seeing me, the faces in the room changed, most looking uncomfortable.

After all, they had just been badmouthing me, and now I had walked in on them.

As the largest shareholder, I naturally took the main seat and looked at everyone. "You all have quite the reputation in Suncrest City, but I didn't expect you to enjoy gossiping behind people's backs."

This made their faces even more uncomfortable, knowing I was referring to their earlier comments about me and Gerald.

The loudest one slammed the table and stood up. "Say what you mean. Stop being so passive-aggressive. We don't accept a young girl holding the most shares. So what if Mr. Castillo holds them? What qualifications do you have?"

"And Gerald's intentions were never pure. He probably used those shares to enrich himself. How else could he have bought those properties in the urban renewal area?"

Listening for a while, I finally understood. This person was jealous of the properties Gerald left me that could be part of the urban renewal. No wonder he was acting this way.

I chuckled. "Do you have any evidence?"

"Of course, I do! The money Gerald used to buy those properties is evidence. It's not a small amount!"

I chuckled again. "Just because you can't come up with the money, you think my dad couldn't either?"

"You're just jealous of my dad and resentful of the wealthy."

The man glared at me. "How dare you talk to me like that? I'm your elder. Didn't Gerald teach you any manners?"

I could tolerate his words about me, but when he started on Gerald, I slammed the table, and the room fell silent.

"My dad had plenty of manners. His biggest mistake was bringing a jerk like you into the company after investing. You've enjoyed the benefits and dividends he left, only to turn around and slander him."

The man glared. "Say that again, and see if I don't-"

Before he could finish, Royce calmly interjected, "See if you don't what? Are you threatening Ms. Sharp?"

"Don't forget, I'm still here. Do you think you can act out of line?"

"I'm here not because I care about the company's shares. You all know I have many companies. This is just one of them. But because of my close relationship with Mr. Gerald Sharp and Ms. Caroline Sharp, I was entrusted with something."

"He foresaw that some of you might bully his daughter, so he gave me a document."

He pulled out a stack of papers and had his assistant distribute them.

"Read this, and you'll understand."

I was surprised. I thought today was just a regular shareholders' meeting, so I came unprepared. It wasn't until I got here that I realized it was about my impeachment.

Who knew Royce had prepared for this long ago, with documents Gerald had given him.

###chapter 147

I grabbed one of the documents from Royce's hand, and it clearly laid out Gerald's assets from back in the day.

Turns out, the money he invested in the company came from selling Kelly's family home and our own house. He then funneled all that cash into this construction materials company.

Later, the money he made from buying properties on Main Street was all legit earnings from this company.

Everything was written down clearly, with no issues or falsehoods.

The folks who had just been grilling Gerald were stunned. One of them, in disbelief, said, "No way, no way, I don't buy it!"

"Gerald must have abused his power. How else would he have known about the urban renewal plans for Main Street and bought up so much property just before it happened?" another person accused.

Carl cleared his throat. "Mr. Sharp's earnings over the years aren't just from his 30% share."

"I also hold 10% on behalf of Mr. Sharp. Plus, Mr. Sharp has made several other long-term investments. Is it really that surprising he has this much money?"

"Mr. Cook, just because you lack vision doesn't mean everyone else does."

The person who had defended my dad earlier now had a smirk on his face. "Serves you right."

Ralph Cook, the guy who had been accusing Gerald, suddenly stood up and glared at me and Carl. "You just wait. You'll get what's coming to you."

"Sooner or later, you'll realize Gerald had bad intentions all along, and you'll regret it!"

He turned to leave, and the others who had been badmouthing Gerald also got up to follow him.

Just then, Royce called out a few names, including Ralph and the others who had been slandering Gerald.

"Did I say you could leave?"

"What else do you want?"

"I have another set of documents for you to look at."

Royce pulled out another stack of papers and had them passed around. He seemed like a magician with an endless supply of tricks.

Royce really had thought of everything.

As everyone read the new documents, the room fell silent.

The people whose names had been called looked especially pale and incredulous.

"How did you get this?" one of them stammered.

Royce chuckled. "Mr. Cook, you've been taking kickbacks from our company for years, making your relatives or people who paid you suppliers. You've probably pocketed over ten million dollars by now."

"You've seriously violated our company's policies, and your actions are illegal. I've already called the police. They'll be here soon to take you in for questioning."

"And the rest of you involved won't escape either."

The group was stunned, collapsing into their chairs.

"How did you find out? How did you investigate this?" one of them asked.

Royce chuckled again. "If you don't want to be caught, don't do it in the first place."

"You should start thinking about how you'll handle life in prison."

Not long after, the police arrived, led by Simon.

He pointed out a few people. "Take these individuals into custody."

The shareholders' meeting ended in chaos.

Those who had been too close to Mr. Zhang were now on edge, worried that Royce might turn his attention to them next. After all, who in business doesn't have a few secrets?

As soon as the meeting ended, everyone rushed to cozy up to Royce.

But Royce waved them off.

I couldn't help but admire him. "I had no idea they were pulling these stunts. How did you figure it out?"

Royce chuckled, shedding his commanding presence from the meeting room and looking more like a smug kid. "Because I'm smart, obviously."

I rolled my eyes. "A few compliments and you're already full of yourself."

He asked, "Has Brandon left?"

I nodded. "Yeah, he took today's flight. He should be arriving in Skyview City soon."

Royce chuckled. "He's in for a rough time when he gets back."

Thinking about the current situation in Skyview City and Brandon's predicament, I couldn't help but laugh.

He was right; Brandon was in for it.

As we walked out, Carl came over to invite us to dinner.

I was about to accept when Royce declined. "No need. Ms. Sharp said she wanted to treat me to dinner alone."

Carl gave a knowing smile. "Alright, you two go ahead. I'll sit this one out."

I was taken aback, staring at Royce. "When did I say I was treating you?"

Royce chuckled. "After all the help I gave you today, you're not going to treat me to dinner?"

I had no choice but to nod. Royce was right; I owed him a meal.

If it weren't for him, I would have had a hard time handling today's situation.

And I didn't know these shareholders well enough to know where to start. It would have been tough to get out of this mess.

"Fine, where do you want to eat?"

Royce paused for a moment, then asked, "Can you cook?"

I was surprised but nodded. "I can, but I haven't cooked in a long time."

For one, we always had a housekeeper, and Brandon didn't let me cook to maintain his good husband image. And lately, I've been too focused on revenge to think about cooking.

I used to love cooking, experimenting with recipes in the kitchen. Seeing my family enjoy the food and compliment it always made me happy.

Royce nodded. "Then it's settled. You'll come to my place and cook for me."

I was so stunned that I let Royce lead me to his car and drive to his place.

This was my second time at his house, and remembering the last visit made me feel a bit awkward.

I went to his kitchen and opened the fridge, only to find it nearly empty, with just a few cans of beer and soda.

"Mr. Castillo, your fridge is pathetic. There's nothing to cook with."

Royce chuckled. "I can go shopping with you. I didn't know what you'd want to cook, so I didn't buy anything."

I nodded. That made sense. After all, you can't cook with just a few cans of beer and soda.

We went downstairs and headed to a nearby grocery store.

He pushed the cart as we went to the produce section.

For a moment, I had the illusion that we were a couple who had been together for ten years, just going about our daily routine.

Royce picked up a tomato and asked, "Can you make beef stew with tomatoes?"

I nodded, watching him put it in the cart.

He led me through the store until I bumped into someone. Royce looked back at me. "How can you be so distracted while walking?"

I snapped back to reality, realizing that this moment of relaxation wasn't my everyday life but a rare break.

After today, I'd be back to my battle with Brandon.

###chapter 148

Royce and I were wandering through the supermarket. The bustling noise of the crowd around us gave me a surreal feeling, like this was the life I was meant to live.

I slowed my pace, and Royce stopped the shopping cart to wait for me.

He finally couldn't hold back and grabbed my hand, pulling me forward. "What are you always thinking about? How can you get so distracted just walking?"

I was taken aback and awkwardly moved my hand. "Why do you care what I'm thinking? Let go of me."

He turned back and gave me a bright smile. "No way, come on, let's hurry up. We need to get some meat."

He held my hand as we strolled through the supermarket.

When we reached the meat counter, the butcher smiled at us and asked, "What kind of meat are you looking for?"

Royce looked at me. "What do you want to cook?"

I cleared my throat, trying to suppress the strange feeling inside me. "I'll take some pork belly and a bit of tenderloin."

The butcher cheerfully cut the meat for us and then looked at us with a smile. "You two make such a good-looking couple. I bet your kids will be adorable."

"Seeing you two makes me happy. I'll just round down the price for you."

I was stunned and exchanged a glance with Royce. I was about to refuse.

But Royce suddenly grabbed my hand and smiled, nodding. "Yes, we're a couple. You have a good eye, sir. Don't we look perfect together?"

The butcher nodded enthusiastically. "Absolutely, you do."

After leaving the meat counter, I glared at Royce. "We're not a couple. Why did you say that?"

Royce looked innocent. "He was going to give us a discount. Should I have denied it and made him add the extra cents back? Why not save money when we can?"

I couldn't help but scoff. "The famous Mr. Castillo cares about saving eight cents?"

"Of course, I do. Money is saved, not wasted. I work hard for my money, so why shouldn't I save it?"

His eyes sparkled with mischief as he said this.

I rolled my eyes at him. "Don't say things like that again. What if someone hears and misunderstands?"

Royce shrugged nonchalantly. "Let them. I don't care."

I was so annoyed that I slapped his broad shoulder. "I care, I care, I care."

He laughed and let me hit him, then suddenly grabbed my wrist and looked down at me.

His deep gaze made me inexplicably nervous. "What are you doing?"

Royce chuckled and let go of my hand. "Nothing. I just noticed that you always get nervous when I tease you. It makes me want to keep teasing you."

I glared at him. "Stop teasing me. We still have other things to buy. Don't you want to eat?"

Royce nodded and followed me.

We continued pushing the cart to the next section. After we had gathered all the ingredients and seasonings we needed, he suddenly suggested we check out the household goods section, saying we needed to restock.

Since I was with him, I couldn't leave early, so I followed him.

In the household goods section, he kept asking for my opinion.

At first, I gave him serious answers, but then I realized he didn't seem to know what to buy and was just asking me.

I finally lost my patience and glared at him. "Are you messing with me?"

Royce shook his head, looking innocent. "No, I really want to buy things."

I scoffed and looked at the empty cart. "What have you bought? There's nothing in the cart. What are you trying to buy?"

"If you keep this up, I'm leaving."

Royce shook his head. "Let's go somewhere else. I really need to buy something."

He led me through several sections of the supermarket. Watching him look cluelessly at laundry detergent, toilet paper, and other household items, I realized he probably never bought these things himself. He must have had someone else take care of it. This trip was just an excuse.

The worst part was he kept holding my hand, making me follow him.

I had enough of being dragged around like an idiot and shook off his hand.

"Are you done yet? I haven't seen you buy anything. Let's go back."

Royce suddenly stopped and looked at me silently.

His dark eyes showed a hint of hurt.

His expression made me feel uneasy.

I took a few steps back. "What are you doing?"

I thought Royce wouldn't answer, but he suddenly said, "Do you remember when we used to go to the supermarket in high school?"

"We bought a bunch of snacks, and you told me that when we got married, we could shop for household items together, picking out the best things for our home."

"But reality isn't like that. I only took you around twice, and you're already impatient."

Memories flashed through my mind.

Royce and I had gone to the supermarket many times, but only for snacks.

We would see couples pushing carts together, discussing what to buy in the household section.

I excitedly told Royce, "We should do that in the future, you know?"

"After we get to the supermarket, we can talk about what we want to buy and fill our cart together, bringing everything home."

Royce looked at the couple and smiled. "Are you sure you can do that with me? I bet I'll be the one deciding what to buy while you just joke around."

I laughed and cupped my face. "I'll be the one making you laugh, and you'll be the one managing our home. Isn't that perfect?"

Royce smiled helplessly and suddenly kissed my cheek.

"Alright, I agree."

"This face is indeed beautiful. Having you by my side will definitely make me proud."

Being kissed in such a public place made my face turn red. I slapped him several times. "Who told you to kiss me? Who told you to kiss me? If you do this in public again, I won't go out with you anymore."

###chapter 149

As the memories faded, I found myself staring blankly at Royce in front of me. I sighed and looked down.

"Sorry, I forgot."

"Have you ever thought that we can't be as naive as we used to be? Our identities and everything we've been through over the years make it hard for us to go back to the way things were or interact like we used to."

"So..."

I didn't finish my sentence, but Royce seemed to understand. He nodded slightly, his eyes darkening.

"I get it."

He then turned around, pushing the shopping cart as we left the supermarket. This time, he didn't hold my hand. I looked at my empty palm, feeling an inexplicable sense of loss.

We carried our groceries upstairs, and I headed into the kitchen to start cooking. Royce stood at the doorway, watching me silently for a moment before asking, "Need any help?"

I shook my head without saying a word.

After a while, I felt his gaze leave me. I turned around to see that he was no longer at the door. I sighed softly and began washing the ingredients.

There was a sadness I couldn't quite describe, and only by keeping busy could I forget it. Although I hadn't cooked in a long time, my hands moved skillfully, almost effortlessly.

After preparing several dishes, I called Royce to help me bring them to the table. He appeared quickly, looking at the food and genuinely complimenting, "Not bad, looks and smells great."

I chuckled lightly and glanced at him. "Finally, a good word from you."

After we set the table, he went to the wine cabinet and opened a bottle of red wine, pouring it into a decanter.

I was surprised. "Are you going to drink? I can't handle alcohol."

Royce shook his head. "It's fine, I'll drink. You can have a soft drink."

I had to admit, Royce exuded an air of elegance and nobility. Even the way he handled the food, with his long, graceful fingers, was refined. Watching him, I couldn't help but ask, "Is it good? I haven't cooked in years."

Royce thought for a moment and nodded seriously. "It's good, just as good as any restaurant."

Over the years, many people had praised my cooking, including Brandon. Even after I found out he had poisoned me, he subtly hinted that he wanted me to cook for him again. But I never did. Yet, Royce's compliment made me genuinely happy.

I didn't know why I felt this way.

"Then eat more."

I avoided his gaze and focused on eating, while Royce started drinking. He drank glass after glass, and before I knew it, the decanter was more than half empty.

I was startled and tried to stop him, but he shook his head.

"Why are you drinking so much?"

Royce calmly replied, "I just want to."

By the time we finished dinner, Royce had drunk quite a bit. His face was flushed, and his eyes were hazy with intoxication. He slumped on the couch, unmoving. After cleaning up the kitchen, I was about to leave when I saw him still sitting there.

I couldn't help but go over and gently pat his face. "Hey, you okay?"

Royce didn't move, clearly drunk. I thought about leaving him there, but then I worried he might catch a cold if he slept on the couch all night.

I decided to carry him to the bedroom, but Royce was a six-foot-tall man, lean but muscular. I couldn't lift him. I tried to wrap my arms around his waist and stand up, but he was dead weight, and I ended up falling into his arms, looking like I was hugging him.

I quickly got up, frustrated. "Why'd you drink so much? Now you're just causing trouble."

I draped his arm over my shoulder, trying to help him stand. But he was too heavy, and I had to wake him up. "Royce, wake up."

He opened his bleary eyes, his voice hoarse from the alcohol. "What is it?"

"You drank too much. Let's get you to bed."

Royce struggled to his feet, and I took the opportunity to support him, one arm around his waist and the other over my shoulder, slowly guiding him to the bedroom.

Just as I was about to drop him onto the bed, our clothes somehow got tangled, and I ended up falling on top of him.

Royce let out a muffled groan, clearly in pain. I scrambled to get up, but our clothes were still connected, making it look like I was flailing in his arms.

Royce finally couldn't take it anymore. He wrapped his arms around me, pressing me against his chest.

"Can you stop moving?"

I froze and quickly explained, "Our clothes are stuck. Help me untangle them."

But Royce fell asleep again, his breathing heavy, eyes closed. His long lashes fluttered slightly, as if he was sleeping uneasily.

I tried to untangle our clothes myself, but I couldn't reach the spot where they were connected. I had no choice but to give up.

At that moment, Royce turned on his side, pulling me into his arms. Our clothes came loose, but his arm was still heavy on me, holding me tightly.

After all the commotion, I was sweating and exhausted. My body hadn't fully recovered, and I had no strength left. I resigned myself to lying there, staring at the sleeping Royce.

"Are you doing this on purpose?"

Royce didn't respond. His other hand unconsciously reached out, pulling the blanket over both of us.

I was increasingly convinced he was doing this on purpose, but there was nothing I could do. The warmth made my eyelids grow heavy.

I thought that if I woke up early, Royce wouldn't be holding me anymore, and I could slip away quietly.

So I closed my eyes and fell asleep.

What I didn't notice was that after I closed my eyes, Royce opened his slightly, glanced at me, and held me even tighter.

###chapter 150

I don't know if it was because I was next to Royce, but I felt incredibly at ease. Maybe it was the post-dinner drowsiness, but I ended up sleeping until the middle of the night.

When I opened my eyes, I saw Royce.

Our positions had changed; I was clinging to him tightly, while Royce was lying on the edge of the bed.

He was looking at me with a helpless expression. "You're finally awake."

Startled, I quickly sat up. Thankfully, our clothes were still intact.

Royce sat up too, rubbing his head with a pained expression. "How did you end up in my bed last night? Why didn't you leave?"

I rolled my eyes at him. "It's all your fault! You were drunk, and I was trying to be nice by getting you to bed. But somehow, our clothes got tangled, and I ended up falling onto your bed."

"And then you unconsciously used me as a body pillow. I couldn't get away."

Royce rubbed his head, then suddenly looked at me with wide eyes. "You didn't do anything to me, did you?"

I glared at him. "Shouldn't I be asking you that?"

"But you were the one who got into my bed. I didn't ask you to stay, so of course, I should be asking you."

Unable to argue with Royce, I decided to get up and leave.

My phone showed numerous missed calls from Savannah, Kathy, and Kelly. Seeing all those missed calls, I knew I was in for a lot of gossip when I got back.

I got out of bed and started putting on my shoes, but Royce grabbed my arm.

"Where are you going?"

"Home, of course. If I don't get back soon, they'll blow up my phone, and they might even call the police."

Royce pointed to the dark sky outside. "It's 2 AM. Did you drive here?"

I shook my head. I had come with Royce in his car, so there was no way I could have driven.

"You won't be able to get a cab now. And even if you could, it's too dangerous for a girl to be out alone at this hour. I can't let you go back by yourself."

I was about to argue, but Royce continued, "And I can't drive you back either. My car is out of gas. I only have one car here, and it ran out when I drove you home."

Great, he had blocked all my options.

"So what am I supposed to do?"

He suggested, "I think you should stay here tonight and leave in the morning when it's light out."

Though it was the last thing I wanted, it seemed like the only viable option.

I sighed and thought about how I had ended up in this situation, then took out my phone to reply to my friends. Savannah and Kathy were still awake, waiting for my message. As soon as they saw it, they called me on video.

Startled, I looked at Royce and warned him, "I'm about to take a video call. Don't come over, or they'll see you."

Royce nodded obediently, but I could see a hint of amusement in his eyes.

I answered the call, and Savannah and Kathy's faces appeared on the screen, immediately bombarding me with questions. "Caroline, where have you been all night?"

Kathy asked, "Where did you go last night? Why didn't you answer our calls? And where did you sleep?"

Feeling guilty, I glanced at Royce, who was sitting and looking at his phone. The screen's light highlighted his features, making him look even more handsome.

I cleared my throat and said, "After the shareholders' meeting, I ran into an old friend from school. We decided to grab dinner, and we ended up having such a good time that we went to her place for a few drinks. I fell asleep and didn't check my phone."

Savannah and Kathy looked skeptical. "Which friend? Do we know her?"

I shook my head. "You don't know her. She's a friend from middle school."

Kathy pressed on, "Is it a guy or a girl?"

I cleared my throat again. "A girl, of course. Do you think I'd stay over at a guy's place?"

Royce glanced at me and chuckled softly.

Savannah and Kathy immediately perked up. "Who was that? We heard someone laugh."

"That was my friend. She has a deep voice, like a guy's. Don't worry, I didn't stay at a guy's place. I just had a bit too much to drink and crashed at her place. I'll head back first thing in the morning."

Their expressions softened, and they seemed to believe me. I was relieved they didn't ask more questions, as I was running out of excuses.

"Caroline, you should have called home too. Mrs. Kelly was worried sick."

I nodded. "I didn't think it through. What did you tell her?"

"Ms. Patel said you messaged her that your phone died and you wouldn't be back. Mrs. Kelly finally went to bed, but she was ready to stay up all night waiting for you."

"I thought Brandon had kidnapped you or something. I was ready to call the police at dawn."

I apologized repeatedly. "I didn't think it through. It won't happen again."

I glared at Royce, the cause of all this. "I'm never coming to his place again. Drinking causes too much trouble."

Royce just smiled.

After hanging up, I let out a deep breath and glared at Royce. "This is all your fault."

He shook his head, not denying it.

I turned off my phone and asked, "Where's the bathroom? I need a shower."

He pointed to a door next to the room.

I hesitated. Showering with Royce nearby, even with a door between us, was something I couldn't accept. "Isn't there another bathroom in this big house?"

Royce said, "There's another one outside, but it hasn't been used in a while."

I grabbed my clothes and headed to the other bathroom. But once inside, I realized I didn't have any clean clothes. Was I supposed to put on dirty clothes after my shower?

After thinking it over, I decided to ask Royce if I could borrow something to wear.

###chapter 151

I turned to Royce and asked, "Hey, you got a clean T-shirt I can borrow? I don't have any clothes to change into. I can deal with the rest, but this one's covered in grease and reeks of your booze. It's unbearable."

Royce opened his closet, revealing a collection of black, white, and gray clothes that perfectly matched his usual style. There were also a few suits that looked custom-made, pretty sophisticated.

I couldn't help but remember how good Royce looked in a suit. It definitely suited him better than his casual wear. The suit hugged his muscular upper body, and his long legs were perfectly covered by the suit pants, giving him an air of aloofness and restraint. His noble demeanor made him even more captivating.

Thinking about him in a suit made me blush, and I didn't even notice when Royce handed me a shirt.

"What's on your mind? Your face is all red," he asked.

Startled, I quickly coughed and took the shirt from his hand, almost running away. "Nothing at all."

I rushed to the bathroom, debating whether to lock the door. Locking it might seem like I didn't trust Royce, especially since this was his place. But not locking it made me feel uneasy. After some thought, I decided not to lock it. I chose to trust Royce; he wouldn't just barge in.

I adjusted the water to the right temperature and started showering. When I finished, I realized there were no towels in the bathroom, and Royce hadn't mentioned it either. I had no choice but to shout his name.

He came over quickly, his tall figure casting a shadow on the bathroom door. "What's up?"

"There are no towels in here. Why didn't you tell me?"

"I forgot," he said confidently. "I usually use the other bathroom, so I didn't think about it. Hold on, I'll get you one."

I sighed and nodded. There wasn't much else I could do. He left and returned shortly with a towel, asking from the door, "How should I give this to you?"

I hesitated, staring at his shadow outside the door, and finally sighed. I stood behind the door and opened it just a crack. "Just pass it through here."

He handed the towel through the gap, his long, elegant fingers gripping it. I quickly grabbed the towel and shut the door, muttering a thank you.

From outside, he asked, "Want something to eat? I can order takeout."

The atmosphere was a bit awkward, so I nodded in agreement, even though I wasn't hungry. He said okay and left, and I felt relieved. Good thing I hadn't locked the door; otherwise, the sound of unlocking it would have made things even more awkward.

After my shower, I walked out to find Royce lounging on the couch, scrolling through his phone. He seemed so engrossed in whatever he was reading that he didn't notice me until I softly called out.

My hair was wrapped in a towel, and I was wearing Royce's oversized shirt, which barely covered my lower half. I had also put on a pair of his shorts since my own clothes were a mess.

Royce's gaze lingered on me for a moment, making me squirm until I fidgeted with the shirt's hem. He finally looked away. "That shirt looks good on you."

I glanced down at the shirt, feeling like a kid playing dress-up in adult clothes. "Yeah, right."

I plopped down on the couch and started drying my hair. Remembering the talk about a late-night snack, I said, "I think I'll skip the snack. I'm planning to head home and sleep."

He suddenly grabbed my hand. "You're going to sleep like that?"

I was puzzled. "What's wrong with it?"

"Your hair's still wet. You'll get a headache tomorrow. Come here, I'll dry it for you."

I couldn't help but grumble, "Why don't you have a hairdryer? You're rich enough to buy one."

He chuckled as he dried my hair with the towel. "Alright, I'll get one tomorrow."

My face reddened. "I don't care if you buy one or not. I'm not coming back anyway."

He didn't respond, just continued drying my hair gently. It felt surprisingly nice.

"You're pretty good at this. Have you done it for your ex-girlfriends?" I teased.

He paused before answering, "You're the only one."

"Really? You never dried your ex's hair? Were you even serious about those relationships?" I joked.

He replied, "I've only ever had one girlfriend."

I turned around, shocked. "Really?"

He looked calm. "What's the big deal?"

I shook my head, trying to suppress my surprise. I didn't want to assume he had waited for me all this time. He was probably just too busy with work to date. For some people, success is more important than relationships. For someone like Royce, success was essential; everything else was secondary.

After he dried my hair, he said, "Don't go to bed yet. Sit with me and have a snack. By the time we're done, your hair will be dry."

I agreed, realizing that was his plan all along. A few minutes later, the food arrived. Royce got up to get it and set it on the table.

Looking at the spread, I noticed it was all food I liked, mostly sweet dishes. I felt touched. "Do you like sweet food?"

Royce sat down, looking confident. "If you like it, why wouldn't I?"

"Eat up before it gets cold. You don't want a stomachache."

I nodded. I wasn't hungry, but I planned to take a few bites. To my surprise, the food was delicious, exactly to my taste.

###chapter 152

I looked at Royce in surprise. "Where'd you order this from? I gotta get food from there too, it's amazing."

Royce was still unpacking the bags and said, "I'll tell you later. Even if I told you now, you wouldn't remember. Just eat first. When you want it again, let me know and I'll order it for you."

I figured he wouldn't tell me tonight, so I just nodded. No way was I relying on him next time. I'd find out the restaurant's name myself and order it.

Over the years, Suncrest City's cuisine had spread across the country, but only the dishes I had as a kid felt truly authentic. The versions I had in Skyview City never quite hit the mark.

I thought only Kelly could recreate that taste, but who knew Royce could randomly pick a place that nailed it too.

Even though I wasn't hungry, I ended up eating a lot because the food was just that good.

After finishing, I slumped back in my chair, satisfied, and let out a deep breath.

"Looks like I can't come to your place anymore. I'll probably gain a couple of pounds from this visit."

Royce glanced at me and chuckled. "You're so skinny right now, you should eat more and put on some weight. Otherwise, it hurts when you poke me."

At first, I didn't get what he meant. Then I suddenly looked up. "What do you mean, it hurts when I poke you?"

I remembered when I accidentally bumped into him while helping him to bed earlier. "You mean back then? You were still conscious?"

Royce realized he had slipped up and quickly avoided my gaze. "I didn't say anything. You're overthinking it."

I stared at him, questioning. "Were you not actually drunk? I was wondering how you could get that drunk on red wine."

"This isn't hard liquor, the alcohol content isn't that high. So, were you pretending the whole time?"

Royce coughed a couple of times, avoiding my eyes. "It's late, your hair is dry now. Go to bed."

I wasn't about to let it go. I stepped closer, staring him down. "Tell me the truth. I hate being lied to."

Royce sighed helplessly and nodded. "I wasn't drunk, but I was really tired."

"I thought you'd just leave me there and go, but you insisted on helping me to bed. Everything else was an accident."

I glared at him, gritting my teeth. "So, you knew I was sleeping in your bed?"

Royce nodded slowly, as if afraid I'd get mad. "Yes."

I was furious. I grabbed a pillow from the couch and threw it at him. "You knew and didn't send me home? You weren't even drunk! Why did you keep me here?"

Royce suddenly grabbed my wrists, holding them tightly. He looked at me earnestly. "Do you really not know why I wanted you to stay?"

I panicked, my earlier bravado gone. Now it was my turn to feel guilty. "I don't care why you wanted me to stay. I'm going to bed, and I'm leaving first thing in the morning."

But Royce didn't let go of my hands.

I could feel the atmosphere getting tense and tried to pull away, but I couldn't.

"Let go of me."

My voice softened involuntarily, sounding almost like a plea.

I was surprised at how soft my voice had become and quickly shut my mouth.

But Royce's deep eyes were still fixed on me. He said, "I know what you meant when you talked to me at the supermarket."

"I've been waiting for you all these years."

When he said that, it felt like fireworks exploded in my mind, leaving me at a loss for how to react.

He had been waiting for me? Really?

I, a woman who had a child and was married for so long, was worth waiting for? I thought self-deprecatingly.

But Royce seemed to understand what I was thinking and hugged me tightly.

His arms held my shoulders firmly, making it impossible for me to move.

"I know what you're thinking, but don't think that way."

"To me, you'll always be the best. No matter what you've been through, it only adds to your charm. It just makes me love you more."

My heart was pounding. His chest was pressed against mine, and I could feel his heart beating just as fast. He was as nervous as I was.

"Royce..."

I didn't know what to say.

"I haven't moved on from my last marriage, and I don't want to jump into another relationship anytime soon."

"You understand what I mean, right? So..."

Before I could finish, he placed a finger on my lips. "I know what you mean, but I'm willing to wait. I don't mind."

He lifted his head and leaned in.

I panicked and closed my eyes, feeling the warmth of his face getting closer.

Finally, his lips brushed against mine, sending a shiver through my body.

It felt like electricity, and my mind exploded with fireworks.

Thankfully, Royce's kiss was brief. He pulled back and said, "It's late. You should go to bed."

I nodded frantically, pulling away from his warm hand and rushing to one of the rooms.

Once inside, I realized it was Royce's master bedroom.

I had to go back out and tell him, "This seems to be your room. Where's the guest room? I'll sleep there."

Royce lit a cigarette and waved me off. "I'll sleep in the guest room. You take the master bedroom."

I couldn't handle his intense gaze and quickly ran inside, closing the door behind me.

Lying in bed, surrounded by Royce's scent, I found it hard to sleep.

My mind was filled with thoughts of Royce's kiss.

It made my heart race more than it did in high school.

Back then, it took him a month after we started dating to hold my hand. I thought he didn't like me.

But later, I heard from Royce's friends that he was just too nervous to touch me.

When I found out, I teased him about it for a long time.

Royce, always so cool and aloof, had a weakness. I couldn't resist making fun of him.

But then Royce got angry and suddenly kissed me hard on the lips, then asked me in a low voice, "Do you think I'm afraid now?"

I was so shocked that I ran home.

When I got home, I flopped onto my bed, kicking and flailing, making my parents come in to ask what was wrong.

###chapter 153

I snapped out of my memories, feeling more embarrassed by the second.

After tossing and turning for what felt like forever, I finally fell into a deep sleep.

When I woke up the next morning, Royce was already up, sitting on the couch.

He acted like nothing had happened and asked, "Want some breakfast?"

I shook my head, staring at the ashtray on the coffee table, filled with cigarette butts, feeling a bit stunned.

"Did you stay up all night?"

Royce nodded, then stood up and grabbed his car keys from the table. "Come on, I'll drive you home."

I suddenly remembered him saying his car was out of gas.

But then he looked at me and smiled. "I lied. I just wanted you to stay here last night."

His honesty left me speechless, so I just nodded dumbly. "No need, you should rest. I'll just call a cab. It's already daytime anyway."

Royce insisted on driving me, and I couldn't argue with him, so I finally agreed.

He drove me to the entrance of my street and didn't move from the car.

The atmosphere felt awkward, and just as I was about to unbuckle my seatbelt and get out, I realized the door was locked. I couldn't move.

I looked at him and whispered, "Open the door."

He looked at me and said, "Everything I said last night was true. I'll wait for you after you get divorced."

With that, I heard a click, and the door unlocked. I didn't know how to react, so I just pushed the door open and hurried out.

When I got home, Kathy was standing at the door, looking at me teasingly.

"I saw you getting out of Royce's car. Did you sleep at his place last night?"

I shook my head. "No, I ran into him this morning, so he gave me a ride back."

"I really didn't sleep at his place, honestly."

Savannah joined in, staring at me for a long time. "Ms. Sharp, your eyebrows always twitch when you lie. They twitched this time too. You did sleep at Royce's place, didn't you?"

Kathy nodded, looking at me with a questioning gaze. "Yeah, how come I never run into such coincidences?"

I sighed helplessly. One was a gossip expert, and the other was an interrogation pro. How could I possibly escape their scrutiny?

"Fine, I'll tell you. I did sleep at Royce's place."

They both got excited and jumped up, asking, "Tell us the details! What happened between you two?"

I briefly explained the shareholders' meeting from yesterday, but I didn't mention the kiss or his confession. I just said he got drunk, and due to a misunderstanding, I had to stay at his place, and when I woke up in the middle of the night, there was no car.

Kathy looked disappointed. "I thought there'd be more sparks flying. Turns out it was so boring."

I rolled my eyes at her. "Do you think my life is a soap opera? It was just a coincidence. I knew you'd gossip like this, which is why I didn't want to tell you."

Kathy rolled her eyes. "Who knew Royce would blow such a golden opportunity."

She tugged Savannah away. "Come on, this is a snooze fest. Not worth our time."

I watched them leave, feeling a bit helpless, then headed into Kelly's room. She was helping Brett and Briar with their studies.

The other two kids were still sound asleep.

Kelly saw me come in and gave me a reproachful look. "You're an adult now. If you're not coming home at night, at least let me know. I was worried sick."

"And Kathy and Savannah were waiting for you. How could you be so clueless?"

I humbly accepted Kelly's criticism, nodding repeatedly.

"I'm sorry, Mom. Last night was really unexpected. It was all a misunderstanding. I won't do it again."

Seeing my sincere apology, Kelly finally huffed and handed me a test paper.

"Take a look."

I saw it was Brett's test paper. Brett was peeking at me while doing his homework.

It was his winter break math assignment, and it was a perfect score.

I looked at it in disbelief. Since he started school, I always thought he wasn't good at math. His scores were always around 20 or 30. I talked to his teachers and to Brett, and he said he just didn't like math.

Eventually, I stopped pushing him.

Luckily, Brett was great at sports, picking up anything quickly. So I thought, if he can't be a mathematician, he could be an athlete.

But in less than a month with Kelly, his math had improved dramatically to a perfect score.

Although Kelly was a retired math professor, I never expected such progress.

"Is this your test, Brett?"

I looked at him in disbelief. Brett immediately showed a proud expression. "Aren't you going to praise me?"

No parent doesn't want their child to excel. I didn't push him because I wanted him to have a happy childhood.

But the joy of seeing a perfect score was incomparable. I grabbed Brett's face and kissed him twice.

"My darling, you made me so happy. How did you do it?"

Brett cheerfully pointed at Kelly. "I like the way Grandma teaches. Math is easy to understand. I can't understand the school teacher."

Kelly proudly waved her fan. "In all my years of teaching, I've never met a dumb student. Kids this age aren't dumb; you just need to explain things in a way they understand."

I was overjoyed. "Grandma's the best. You're amazing."

"Why don't you leave the kids with me? I'll tutor him. Otherwise, he'll fall back to his old ways once he goes back."

Honestly, I had already considered it. I planned to return to Suncrest City once everything settled, so transferring Brett to a school here made sense.

I looked at Brett. Ultimately, it was his decision.

"Brett, do you want to stay with Grandma?"

Brett nodded eagerly. "Yes, I want to stay with Grandma. She's so kind. I love her."

Seeing Brett's happy face and Kelly's loving gaze, I finally made up my mind.

###chapter 154

I couldn't help but smile as I looked at Brett's test paper, feeling a surge of joy.

As I stepped out of the room, I saw Holly cooking in the kitchen while Savannah was discussing the dinner menu with her. They both noticed my excitement and immediately asked what had happened.

I proudly held up the test paper for them to see. "Brett scored a perfect 100 on his math test today! Isn't that worth celebrating?"

Holly clapped her hands. "Absolutely! I'll go out and get some delicious food right now. Let's have a proper celebration tonight."

Savannah joined in with a smile. "That's fantastic! Thanks to Mr. Jordan, we're in for a treat tonight."

"Ms. Sharp, what would you like for lunch? Holly and I can pick something up while we're out."

I shook my head. "I won't be home for lunch. I'm planning to meet up with Asher."

"It's been a while since I last saw him."

"Alright, then we'll handle lunch ourselves. Come back for dinner, Ms. Sharp, and we'll all eat together."

I nodded, took a short rest at home, and then drove over to Asher's place.

Lately, good news has been coming one after another. Not only Brett's grades but also Brandon's plans are about to kick off, and the shareholders' meeting issues have been resolved smoothly.

It feels like all the good days are arriving at once, making me feel a bit dizzy and unreal.

It hasn't even been a year since I was lying in a hospital bed, sleeping away the days.

But now, I feel like a completely different person. Sometimes I wonder if those hazy days really happened or if they were just a long dream.

When I arrived at Asher's place, he was working out on the balcony, lifting weights in the sunlight.

I knocked on the door, and he answered, sweating and wearing just a tank top. He smiled as soon as he saw me. "Caroline, what brings you here?"

I held up the food I bought from a nearby restaurant. "I came to have lunch with you. Not happy to see me?"

"Of course, I'm happy! I was just wondering what to do for lunch. You know, living alone, it's hard to get the portions right when cooking, and I never finish takeout. I'm so glad you're here to share."

We went inside and set the takeout boxes on the coffee table in the living room.

Looking at his tidy apartment and the spotless floor, I couldn't help but tease him. "Asher, haven't you thought about finding a wife? You're so great at housekeeping and love working out. It'd be a waste not to."

"I just haven't met the right person yet. If I did, I'd definitely get married. But right now, I'm not in a hurry. I'll think about it after we finish our business here."

A wave of sadness washed over me. Asher is at an age where he should be settling down, but instead, he's waiting for me to reclaim the company.

"Asher, once everything is settled, I want you to take over the company in Skyview City. I want to stay in Suncrest City to be with my mom and handle the urban renewal project. So, I want you to manage things in Skyview City."

I have complete faith in Asher's abilities. He shouldn't be held back here.

With his skills, he could manage even better than Brandon.

When I decided to return to Suncrest City, I thought long and hard about who should take over there. In the end, Asher was the only suitable choice. He has the capability and the right temperament.

Asher looked surprised. "Caroline, are you sure you don't want to go there?"

I shook my head. "My mom is getting older, and she's really lonely here. Besides, there's nothing in Skyview City that I care about anymore. Even though I lived there for over a decade, it all feels like a lie now. I'd rather leave that place behind and not be reminded of the past."

Asher sighed. "If that's how you feel, I won't stop you."

I nodded, and we sat down to eat.

I've had so much good news lately that I couldn't help but want to share it with someone.

I didn't want to see Royce right now because things are still awkward between us, so Asher was the only one I could turn to.

Kathy and Savannah wouldn't understand, and I didn't want to worry my mom, so Asher was my only option.

We chatted about all the recent good news while we ate.

For a moment, it felt like I was back in high school, when Wu Yao and I would always eat together.

Later, Royce joined us.

Maybe that was the most relaxed time of my life.

After lunch with Asher, I got up to head back home.

Since I decided to keep Brett here, I needed to start looking for a school.

Brett is still young, so the school needs to be close to home.

I planned to find a school within a mile of our house so it would be easier for my mom to pick him up.

After visiting a few schools, I found that each had its pros and cons. None of them were perfect.

So, I decided to take notes and let Brett choose. After all, it's his school, and his happiness is what matters most.

When I got home, Brett had finished his homework and was watching TV. I showed him pictures of the schools.

"Which one do you want to go to?" I asked.

To my surprise, Brett frowned and looked at me with a sad expression. "I don't want to go to any of them."

I was taken aback and quickly asked why.

Brett's answer left me stunned.

"The kids at those fancy schools always make fun of me. They say I don't have a mom to pick me up. Even though you were sick, they kept cursing you. I got so mad I wanted to fight them, but the teacher said I was rude and had no manners."

"So, I don't want to go to those schools."

I was shocked and regretful. I had overlooked this aspect. Brett had been bullied at his previous private school, leaving him with a shadow.

Maybe this was one of the reasons Brett didn't want to study, and it was my fault.

Feeling guilty, I hugged him and patted his small shoulder. "I'm sorry. This time, it's my fault. You can choose whichever school you want, and I'll listen to you."

###chapter 155

In the end, Brett picked a school that, while lacking in extracurricular activities and being pretty affordable, had a strong faculty and a less competitive vibe.

I asked Brett why he chose that school. He pulled out his phone and showed me what he had just looked up. "I found out this school has a lot of kids from single-parent families. So even if only Grandma comes to pick me up, I won't get teased."

My heart sank. I comforted him, apologizing and admitting my mistakes.

Kelly cut in, "Alright, alright, are you two done yet?"

"Let the kid watch some cartoons. He finally gets a break."

I smiled, patted Brett on the head, and let him sit on the couch to watch TV.

Just then, I noticed my mom and Holly with the other two kids. I was surprised. "What about them? They can talk and walk now. They're almost ready for preschool. Should they come with me?"

Honestly, I wanted to leave them in Suncrest City. They could keep Brett company, and it would be easier for them to adjust to preschool without frequent moves like Brett had.

I shared this with Kelly, and she nodded. "I was thinking the same. No matter what you do over there, leave the kids with me. I'll take good care of them."

I hesitated. "Won't it be too much for you?"

Holly chimed in, "Ms. Caroline Sharp, I can stay and help Mrs. Kelly Sharp. I love Suncrest City, the climate is great, and I've grown attached to the kids. I'd be sad to leave them."

Kelly agreed, "Yes, let Holly stay and help me with the kids."

I nodded. It was a good idea. I wasn't comfortable taking the kids back to Skyview City, especially with the upcoming confrontation with the Jordan family. Who knows what could happen?

So, I agreed.

The two kids, with their few new teeth, were smiling, unaware of what was happening.

I knelt down and ruffled their hair. "We'll be apart for a while, but I'll be back soon."

Talking about it made me emotional. I really didn't want to leave my three kids.

Kelly sighed, "You're not even gone yet. Save the drama for when you leave."

She was right. I wasn't leaving for Skyview City just yet. I needed to cherish the time with my kids.

I saw Briar sitting nearby and called her over, hugging her.

Briar looked a bit sad. I realized I had been neglecting her and quickly made it up to her.

She was young and easily cheered up.

I asked, "Have you called your dad?"

Briar shook her head. "Not yet."

Kelly added, "Even if they don't call, you should update them on Briar. It puts their minds at ease."

I nodded. I had overlooked this. So, I called Leo.

He didn't answer, probably busy at work.

I showed Briar the missed call screen. She looked a bit disappointed.

But kids are resilient. She quickly joined Brett in watching TV.

I went back to my room and soon got a call from Leo.

"Caroline, did you call me?"

I nodded. "I've been so comfortable here, I forgot to call. Briar's having a great time, playing with Brett every day."

Leo chuckled. "Seems like she's showing her true colors. She hasn't caused any trouble, has she?"

I shook my head. "Not at all. Briar's been great. She's a bit more active here, but still much better behaved than Brett. You wouldn't believe how much energy he has."

"Briar is so sweet. She sits and draws quietly. She's adorable."

Leo laughed. "Your kids will probably be the same. What are you worried about?"

I sighed, pretending to be troubled. "I'm just afraid Brett will be a bad influence."

We chatted a bit more, and I casually mentioned, "By the way, can you have Renee call Briar? She's been asking about her."

Leo paused. "Renee called me today, asking where Briar was. I told her she was with you. She didn't say much and hung up."

I listened carefully, becoming alert.

"Did Renee say when she'd be back?"

"No, she seemed in a hurry."

I made a mental note to have Simon look into it.

"Alright, just have Renee call Briar. She misses her mom."

Leo agreed. "If Briar needs anything, let me know. I'll send money."

I smiled. "Leo, don't worry. We can take care of Briar. Besides, I enjoy spending on her. If she were disrespectful, I wouldn't spend a dime. But Briar's not like that."

###chapter 156

I took my phone downstairs to find Briar. She was watching TV with Brett. I handed her the phone and said, "Briar, it's your dad."

Briar's face lit up as she eagerly took the phone. "Dad, why'd it take you so long to call? I missed you so much!"

She moved to a corner to talk privately. I watched her reaction closely. Since the call wasn't on speaker, Leo might say something about Renee that I wouldn't hear.

Unable to eavesdrop, I grew anxious. Suddenly, Briar glanced at me cautiously and said, "No."

I realized Leo might be about to share a secret. I looked at Brett and whispered for him to sit next to Briar and listen in, then tell me what Leo said.

Brett's eyes widened in confusion. I whispered, "Just listen and tell me later. I'll explain everything then."

"This is a secret mission. You have to keep it confidential, okay?"

Brett's eyes sparkled with excitement. He nodded and scooted over to Briar. Briar glanced at him but didn't say anything.

Whatever Leo said next made Briar look dejected. She mumbled, "Got it," and her mood didn't improve for the rest of the call.

When she handed the phone back to me, the call had already ended. I asked, "Why are you so upset? Do you want to talk about it?"

Briar shook her head, looking miserable. "Dad told me not to tell you."

I was taken aback. Clearly, there was a secret involved. Forcing a smile, I patted her head. "It's okay if you don't want to talk. Why don't you watch some TV? Dinner will be ready soon."

Briar nodded and sat on the couch. I quickly pulled Brett into another room. "Did you hear anything? What did her dad say?"

Brett looked puzzled. "It was a woman, not her dad. She asked a lot of questions about you, like if you were treating Briar well or if you ever hit her. I don't know who she was."

"A woman?" I immediately thought of Renee. Was she planning to take Briar?

If Renee was back, did that mean Earl was back too? Or was there another reason? And why did Leo lie to me about Renee not being home?

Was Leo helping Renee hide something? Did Renee know we were investigating her and Earl's disappearance?

I was baffled. I patted Brett's head and told him to go play with Briar.

Then I called Simon. He answered quickly, sounding tired. "Caroline? What's up?"

"I think Renee is back."

I explained what happened. Simon's tone turned serious. "That's odd. We've had people watching Leo's house, but he has such a routine life that we pulled them off. Now you say Renee's back? Could someone on our team be tipping her off?"

I nodded. "It's possible. Otherwise, the timing wouldn't be so perfect. According to Brett, Renee was definitely at home talking to Briar. Briar always looks upset when she talks to Renee. She seems scared of her."

"And I suspect Earl might be back too. His disappearance is connected to Renee. If she's back, he might be too."

Simon agreed. "I'll send someone to watch their house, but I'll choose people I trust. We can't risk being discovered again."

After hanging up, I took a deep breath. My mind was a mess, and my good mood was gone.

Just then, Savannah walked in with a video. "Ms. Sharp, I had someone follow Brandon after he arrived. We found something interesting."

"What did you find?"

She showed me the video. Brandon's car was parked outside a hotel, and he was walking in hand-in-hand with a woman. I recognized her as Maeve, someone we knew from before.

I frowned. "Why are they together again? And why did Brandon go straight to her after landing?"

"We're not sure yet. We're still following him. But instead of visiting his critically ill mother, he went to a hotel with this woman. It's despicable."

I chuckled. "Are you still surprised? I've gotten used to Brandon's behavior."

"The worse he acts, the better it is for us, right?"

Savannah thought for a moment and nodded. "True. The more he messes up, the quicker we can take him down. But it's tough on you, having to put up with him."

I smiled. "This marriage is just a formality now. I can endure it."

"In my eyes, Brandon is already a useless man."

Savannah nodded. Just then, Kathy walked in. "What are you two doing in here? Playing cards again?"

I rolled my eyes. "Don't you have anything better to do? All you do is play, sleep, and play cards."

"Actually, I'm here to say goodbye. I'm flying out tomorrow morning. The studio got a big order to make a custom dress for a wealthy family's daughter. I wanted to enjoy my break, but the price was too tempting to pass up."

###chapter 157

I couldn't help but laugh at her ambitious demeanor. "Weren't you just saying this was supposed to be a vacation, and you were gonna leave all work behind?"

Kathy shook her head, looking a bit helpless. "But it's so much money. How could I possibly turn it down?"

"Alright, if you need to go back, then go. Should I have Simon go with you?"

Kathy shot me a look. "Do I look like a three-year-old? I don't need anyone to take me home. I've already bought my ticket. I'm leaving tomorrow morning, no need to see me off."

Since she was so insistent, there was nothing I could do. I just reminded her to be safe on her way back.

After dinner, I went to bed early. The events of the afternoon had left my mind in a bit of a fog, and I needed some rest to process everything.

In the middle of the night, I woke up thirsty. My throat was dry, and when I reached for the water glass on my nightstand, it was empty. I had no choice but to get up and go to the kitchen for some water.

As soon as I opened the door, I noticed a light coming from the living room.

There was a figure moving quietly in the glow, doing something I couldn't quite make out.

I froze and crept closer.

The person didn't notice me and continued with their task. As I got nearer, I realized they were taking photos of a document I had left on the couch earlier-a stock agreement.

I walked up and saw Eugene, focused on his task, snapping away. He had already taken several photos.

I asked softly, "What are you doing?"

Startled, Eugene dropped the papers he was holding. He turned to me, eyes wide with fear. "Ms. Sharp, why are you up?"

I gave a cold laugh. "If I hadn't come out, I wouldn't have known you were taking pictures of my things. Why are you doing this? Who are you taking these for?"

Eugene waved his hands frantically. "No, no, it's not like that. I was just curious and wanted to look into it."

His flimsy excuse didn't convince me. I scoffed. "Not telling the truth, huh? Fine, I'll call the police right now. Let's see what they have to say."

Eugene panicked. "No, please don't call the police, Ms. Sharp. I swear, I was just curious. I didn't mean any harm. Please don't be angry."

I picked up my phone, pretending to dial. He rushed forward to stop me. I glared at him. "Are you going to get physical with me now?"

Eugene quickly backed off. "No, no, I would never."

I went to the next room and knocked on Savannah's door. She woke up quickly and opened the door. "What's wrong, Ms. Sharp?"

I pointed at Eugene. "I caught him taking pictures of my stuff."

Savannah immediately grabbed Eugene and pinned him down. "Why were you taking those pictures? What's your motive?"

Eugene was terrified, dropping his phone. I picked it up and opened the photo gallery.

It was filled with countless pictures of me, documenting everything I did, even meetings my mom had. The realization of how closely Eugene had been monitoring my life was chilling.

I glared at him. "Who are you sending these to? Why so many pictures of me?"

Eugene tried to deny it at first, but with the evidence laid out, he had no choice but to admit his wrongdoing, though he still wouldn't reveal who was behind it.

I sneered at his silence. "Not talking, huh? Fine, I'll go to the police first thing in the morning. Let's see if you keep quiet then. Once they check your bank records, they'll find out who you're working for."

Eugene's face went pale. "No, no, Ms. Sharp, I'll tell you. It was Mr. Jordan who asked me to take the pictures."

I crossed my arms. "What did he want you to photograph?"

"Everything related to you, especially the urban renewal project."

He spoke cautiously, then fell to his knees. "Please, Ms. Sharp, don't call the police. If I get arrested, I'm done for. I have a niece and her child to take care of. I don't want to drag them into this. I was wrong, I really was."

A niece? I almost laughed. "Your niece's name is Elora, and her child is Jason, right?"

Eugene nodded, looking confused. "Ms. Sharp, how do you know that? Did you know I was spying on you all along?"

I looked at him and said, "Because when Elora died, the police investigated her social connections. That's how I found out about you."

Eugene was stunned. "Elora is dead? Ms. Sharp, please don't joke about this. She's my only family. You can punish me however you want, but..."

I turned to Savannah. "Show him the video."

Savannah nodded, took out her phone, and played the video of Elora jumping off a building, handing it to Eugene.

Eugene's hands trembled as he took the phone. He watched in disbelief until the moment of impact, when Elora hit the ground. The phone slipped from his hands, and he collapsed to the floor, his face ashen.

"Elora! Elora!"

Eugene began to wail. "Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought..."

"Do you know why no one told you? Because Brandon intercepted everything. He's involved in this, otherwise why would he keep it from you?"

"And Jason..."

Eugene snapped back to reality. "What about Jason?"

"He's gone too. Someone left him by the shore, and he was swept away by the waves. I handled it personally. We haven't found the culprit yet, so both his and Elora's bodies are still in the police morgue, waiting for justice before they can be buried."

I couldn't describe Eugene's expression. It was as if his world had collapsed.

His eyes were empty, devoid of any emotion.

"If I told you both incidents might be connected to the Jordan family, would you still work for Brandon?"

"By spying for him, you've become his accomplice. If it weren't for you, Elora might still be alive."

"Think carefully. Do you still want to work for Brandon?"

They say extreme grief leaves a person expressionless.

I signaled Savannah to help Eugene up.

Savannah grabbed his arm, and he moved like a ghost, completely at her mercy.

"Lock him in his room. Let him think it over."

Savannah nodded, pushing Eugene into his room and locking the door from the outside.

She returned, looking hesitant. "Ms. Sharp, do you think Eugene will change?"

I sighed, rubbing my temples. "I don't know, Savannah. But he needs to understand the consequences of his actions. Maybe this will make him see the truth."

Savannah nodded, though her expression remained uncertain. "I hope so. For everyone's sake."

###chapter 158

I smirked, "Let's see how Eugene acts tomorrow. If he doesn't play ball, we'll just send him to jail. We don't need him in our family."

Savannah agreed, "Yeah, I think we should. Keeping someone like him around isn't safe."

I nodded, "You're right. I'll think about it. For now, let's keep him locked up. I'll let Mom know about this tomorrow."

After that, we each went to our rooms to sleep. At dawn, I went to find my mom.

I told Kelly everything that happened last night. She was furious, "I've always known Eugene was trouble, but I thought as long as he didn't do anything, it would be fine. But now he's crossed the line. We can't keep him around. Call the police and send him to jail."

I was a bit surprised. Kelly usually seemed kind and gentle, but she could be quite decisive when needed.

"Alright, Mom. I'll do as you say. I'll call the police and have Eugene taken to the station."

I left Kelly's room and went straight to Eugene's room, unlocking the door and stepping inside.

Eugene was in almost the same position as last night, squatting on the floor, eyes bloodshot, and looking extremely pained.

"Have you thought it over?"

Eugene suddenly looked up, glaring at me viciously, "Did you kill Elora?"

"Did you push her off the building because you were jealous she was with Brandon? And her child, you knew it was Brandon's, so you left him by the sea on purpose. You killed them both, didn't you?"

I sneered. Good thing I never planned to keep Eugene around. Even now, he was still so delusional.

"You're overthinking it. I didn't have time to touch Elora or Jason. Everything was done by the Jordan family. If you don't believe me, you can call the police and have them investigate. The truth will come out eventually."

"Elora was just a mistress. I wouldn't dirty my hands by pushing her. Why would I take such a risk and create unnecessary trouble for myself?"

Eugene gritted his teeth, glaring at me, "Elora wasn't a mistress. Shut up!"

I sneered again, "If she wasn't a mistress, what was she? Didn't she seduce Brandon? She even maliciously transferred our company's assets. Did you think I didn't know? Even if she were alive, I'd have sent her to jail. She deserved a long sentence. She only escaped punishment by dying."

"I'll tell you this, I'll make sure you end up in jail too. Reflect on the disaster your family brought upon themselves by getting involved with Brandon's family."

Eugene's vicious expression turned to one of pain. He clutched his hair and screamed, "I didn't want this either. I told her to stay away from Brandon, but she wouldn't listen."

"What could I do? I had to work for Brandon to make him treat Elora better. What else could I do?"

He was almost shouting at me. Savannah rushed into the room, looking worried, "Ms. Sharp, did he do anything to you?"

I shook my head, "No, he didn't. Call the cops now. I think he's already spilled the beans. Let's not waste any more time and just get him out of here."

Savannah nodded and went to make the call.

It wasn't long before the police showed up.

I handed over all the evidence I had collected. They didn't hesitate to arrest Eugene and take him to the station. I went with them to give my statement.

In the interrogation room, Eugene confessed, and I detailed all the evidence he had gathered against our family.

Afterward, the officer told me, "We still need to go through some procedures. We'll notify you when it's done. You can go home for now."

"Oh, and about Brandon..."

If the evidence was solid, Brandon would also be summoned, which could alert him. I wondered if we could avoid summoning Brandon for now.

The officer nodded, "Don't worry. The Skyview City police have already informed us that the Jordan family is connected to an international organ trafficking and drug smuggling ring. We're not to move against them yet. We'll only detain Eugene for now and won't summon Brandon. Rest assured."

I felt relieved and nodded. I left the police station.

As I drove home, I remembered Kathy was leaving today. I hurried back and found her already packed and saying goodbye to my mom and the others.

Brett had his arm around Kathy's waist, looking reluctant, "Ms. Patel, even though you sleep all the time, I'll still miss you."

Kathy looked exasperated, "What are you talking about? I don't sleep all the time."

"But since you said you'll miss me, I'll forgive you. Give me a kiss."

Brett jumped up and kissed her on the right cheek, then the left.

Seeing me return, Kathy couldn't help but complain, "What took you so long? I've been waiting for you. I could have been at the airport by now."

I apologized and hugged her, "I had some things to take care of. Be safe, and call me when you land, okay?"

Kathy nodded, "Don't worry. I know Skyview City like the back of my hand. I won't get lost."

"Alright, I'm off. Take care and rest well. See you in Skyview City."

I nodded and said goodbye. I had Savannah drive Kathy to the airport.

When she returned, I asked, "Did Kathy leave?"

Savannah nodded, "Yes, she said you should take your time and not rush back. She's keeping an eye on things in Skyview City and watching Brandon."

I smiled wryly, "Kathy worries too much. I wouldn't use her to monitor Brandon. Besides, you have people helping me, right? She could put herself in danger."

Savannah laughed, "I told Ms. Patel the same thing, but she seems determined to help you."

I shook my head, "Alright, I'll talk to her when she calls to let me know she arrived safely. I won't let her get involved in this. It's too dangerous."

###chapter 159

That night, after dinner, I played with the kids until it was time for bed.

Kathy's flight was supposed to arrive that evening, but by bedtime, I still hadn't heard from her, and I started to worry.

I quickly called her, and after a long wait, she finally picked up. "Why didn't you answer earlier? It's so late, your flight should have landed ages ago."

Kathy's voice sounded exhausted. "Don't even get me started. The flight was delayed by over an hour."

"Alright, I won't keep you. I need to get home and sleep. I'm exhausted."

I nodded and hung up. Even though I had heard from Kathy, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, like something unexpected was going to happen that night.

This uneasy feeling persisted until the next morning. I had a restless night filled with nightmares, and I woke up yawning repeatedly.

But I had no idea where this anxiety was coming from.

I decided to talk to Savannah about everything that had happened since last night.

"Don't worry, Ms. Sharp. You probably just didn't sleep well and are overthinking things. It's nothing."

"The weather's getting colder. I'll add another blanket to your bed to help you sleep better."

I could only nod, as I had no other solutions.

Because I hadn't slept well the night before, I was extremely tired by noon. I decided to take a nap and called Kathy before lying down, but she didn't answer.

I figured I could call her again after my nap. But then I had a dream about Kathy.

I didn't know where she was, but I could hear her calling my name, her voice growing more urgent, as if she wanted me to find her.

I was terrified and kept calling out, "Kathy, Kathy!"

Savannah woke me up, asking, "Ms. Sharp, are you okay?"

Drenched in cold sweat, I told Savannah about my dream. She said, "It was probably just a nightmare, Ms. Sharp. Don't worry. Besides, Ms. Patel is back at work. What could possibly happen to her?"

I nodded reluctantly and checked my phone, but there was no call from Kathy. She was probably busy. Sometimes she would be unreachable for hours when she was working, only calling back once she was done.

I called her again, but there was still no answer, and her phone was now off. This made me even more anxious.

Could her phone have died? If Kathy noticed, she would have charged it as soon as she got home.

By midnight, I had called her dozens of times with no response. I was now certain something had happened to Kathy. She always checked her phone before bed and would never ignore my calls.

I couldn't wait any longer and called Royce. "Royce, do you know where Simon is staying?"

Royce was taken aback and quickly asked, "What's going on?"

"Kathy's in trouble."

After explaining the situation, Royce told me that Simon was staying at the same hotel I had visited last time.

I hurriedly took Savannah with me to the hotel and knocked on Simon's door.

The lights were on inside, and it was clear they hadn't gone to bed yet. There were a few people I didn't recognize, one of whom was working on a laptop.

I knew they were working, so I didn't pay much attention. Simon looked at me curiously. "Caroline, what brings you here in the middle of the night? Miss me?"

Ignoring his flippant tone, I quickly said, "Kathy's in trouble."

Simon's expression turned serious. "Are you sure? She went back to Skyview City, didn't she?"

I nodded. "Yes, she did. She called me after her flight landed, but I haven't been able to reach her since. She didn't even return my call before bed, which she always does. Something must have happened to her."

After hearing my explanation, Simon's face grew stern. "Got it. I'll track Kathy's location right away. I installed a tracker on your phones, so it should be easy to find her."

He spoke to one of the people at the computer, who immediately started working on it.

Simon stood by, watching. Just then, there was a knock on the door. I glanced over cautiously and saw Royce outside. I quickly let him in.

He said, "I couldn't get the full story over the phone. What exactly happened?"

I repeated everything I had told Simon, and Royce's expression turned serious. He walked over to Simon and asked, "Any luck?"

Simon nodded gravely. "We're tracking her location."

A moment later, Simon's face grew even more serious. "Kathy isn't at home, and her location signal has disappeared. This means she's in a place where the signal is being blocked. Otherwise, we would have found her."

I was frantic and immediately thought of Renee.

Renee was in Skyview City. Could Kathy's disappearance be related to her?

"I'm going back to Skyview City to find her. I'll book the next flight. Renee is in Skyview City, and Kathy is in danger."

I stood up to leave, but Royce and Savannah stopped me. "Wait. You can't find Kathy alone. We need more information."

But I couldn't wait. Every second Kathy was with Renee, she was in more danger. I knew how ruthless Renee could be.

Simon's face was grim. "Caroline, don't worry. I'll find Kathy."

I was restless, Kathy's voice from my dream echoing in my mind. She had been trying to warn me, but I hadn't realized it.

I felt overwhelming guilt. It was my fault Kathy was in this dangerous situation. If it weren't for me, she wouldn't be involved with the Jordan family.

I sat in the chair, clutching my head. "It's all my fault. If it weren't for me, Kathy wouldn't be..."

Royce patted my shoulder. "Caroline, don't blame yourself. It's not your fault. Blame the Jordan family."

###chapter 160

I stayed at the hotel until dawn. Being far away in Suncrest City, things weren't as convenient as they were in Skyview City.

We only managed to find surveillance footage from a few hours before Kathy went missing.

The footage showed her going to her studio early in the morning, and then she never came out again. She had completely vanished.

No matter how we tried to contact her, we couldn't reach her. It seemed she had disappeared from her studio.

Simon contacted the local police, and now the entire city was searching for Kathy.

I stood up and said, "I have to go back. I can't stay here and do nothing. This place is too far from Skyview City. I'm flying back now. At the very least, I need to be there with Kathy."

Royce tried to persuade me otherwise, but I just nodded. "Alright, but you have to be careful. Make sure Savannah stays close to you. I'll come back as soon as I handle things here."

I watched him nod before heading home with Savannah.

Once home, I told Kelly about the situation. She immediately looked worried. "What should we do? Have you called the police?"

I nodded. "Don't worry, I've already contacted them. They're searching the entire city. We'll have clues soon, but I need to go back. I have to be there. I'll leave the kids with you for now."

Kelly understood the seriousness of the situation and just reminded me, "Be safe."

Savannah and I packed our bags and were about to leave when Simon pulled up in front of our house. "I've handed things over to my colleagues here. I'm coming with you."

I quickly nodded. With Simon, things might be more flexible over there. I felt a bit relieved.

The three of us boarded a plane and landed in Skyview City that night.

The city was shrouded in a damp, cold mist, and I felt a growing unease.

Despite the feeling, I couldn't dwell on it. Simon arranged for Savannah and me to get into a police car.

He briefly introduced us to the officer. "This is Chief Roy Murphy, who's been leading the search for Kathy."

Roy spoke up, "Ms. Sharp, please tell me everything you know. It might help us find some clues."

I recounted the timeline of Kathy's disappearance in detail.

But it didn't add much to what the police already knew. They were aware of the timeline, so it wasn't very helpful.

I racked my brain and suddenly remembered, "Right, Kathy mentioned she was going to keep an eye on Brandon for me before she left."

Savannah nodded. "Yes, she told me at the airport. I told Ms. Sharp, and she tried to dissuade her, thinking it was too dangerous."

Could her disappearance be related to Brandon or the Jordan family?

Simon and Roy exchanged serious looks. "It's possible. We'll check the surveillance around Brandon's place and see if anything unusual pops up."

"We'll need your help identifying anything suspicious since you know Brandon best," Simon added.

"And Renee and Earl, I have a feeling they're back in town and might be involved in Kathy's disappearance," I said.

"Karen is in the hospital, critically ill. I can't believe they wouldn't show up," I continued.

They nodded in agreement. "You're right. We'll keep a close watch on them. We've been monitoring them, but nothing unusual has come up. We'll focus more on them now," Roy assured me.

I returned to Skyview City quietly, not even letting Brandon know. Savannah and I stayed at Simon's place, which was under tight police surveillance.

They had deployed many officers to find Kathy, but it was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Meanwhile, the police reported that Brandon had been with Maeve constantly over the past few days.

I sneered, "Spread the word. Let everyone in Skyview City know what Brandon's been up to while his mom is on her deathbed."

Simon caught on immediately. He released the news about Karen's critical condition and followed it with photos of Brandon and Maeve at a hotel.

The internet exploded with outrage. People were furious that Brandon was with another woman while his mother was dying.

The fact that Maeve was his mistress only fueled the fire. The backlash was intense, even affecting the company's stock prices.

Reporters swarmed Karen's hospital, demanding answers.

They knew Brandon was there, waiting for him to come out.

But he never did. He slipped out the back door.

We let the online outrage grow while focusing on finding Kathy. Despite our efforts, it was like she had vanished into thin air.

She had been missing for over ten hours. Anything could have happened in that time, and I dreaded to think what she might be going through. All I could do was pray for her safety.

When human efforts fall short, we turn to higher powers.

I prayed fervently for Kathy's safe return.

We searched Kathy's studio thoroughly.

I went to her studio, finding it empty. Then I noticed the window at the back.

"Do you think Kathy might have sensed something was wrong and escaped through the window? It's big enough for a person to fit through," I suggested.

Behind the studio was a long, narrow alley.

Simon listened carefully and nodded. "You might be right. I'll get a police dog to check for her scent back there."

Soon, a police officer brought a dog. I let it sniff Kathy's clothes, and it started sniffing around the alley. It barked furiously at a spot near the entrance, indicating Kathy had been there and stayed for a while.

###chapter 161

Simon and a group of people, flashlights in hand, arrived at the spot. The marks on the ground were clear, like someone had been dragged there.

"We're almost certain Kathy was tied up here," I said, scanning the area.

There were only a few shops nearby, so we went door to door, checking their surveillance footage under different pretenses, making sure not to raise any suspicions.

Finally, we caught sight of a suspicious vehicle on one of the cameras.

It was a van with its windows completely covered, except for the driver's side where a person was visible. A curtain behind the driver blocked the view of the back, and the driver was heavily covered, only their eyes showing.

"This van was in the area for about half an hour," Simon noted.

"Half an hour is more than enough time to abduct Kathy," I replied. "This van is definitely suspicious. Let's track it through the city's surveillance system and check with the DMV to find out who owns it."

As expected, the van had fake plates. The real owner was on vacation abroad and hadn't returned.

"So, we have to rely on surveillance to track the van," Simon said, frustration evident in his voice.

The system showed that after abducting Kathy, the van left the city and got on the highway, heading to a remote suburban area. It then disappeared from the cameras.

We quickly headed to the last known location of the van. The area was desolate, with a few houses in the distance.

We checked each house but found nothing unusual. Kathy had disappeared here, but where could they have taken her?

"There are no tire tracks nearby," Simon muttered, "It's like the van vanished without a trace."

The search for Kathy was at a standstill. Simon's face was unusually grim as he stared at the spot.

I scanned the area and suddenly noticed a lake in the distance.

"Do you think they might have switched vehicles?" I asked.

Simon nodded. "I thought of that too, but there are no signs of the van nearby. Where could they have switched?"

I pointed to the lake. "Could it be in there?"

Simon and the other officers exchanged glances and quickly threw a rock into the lake. Sure enough, one of the rocks hit something metallic with a clang.

We exchanged looks, and Simon immediately called for specialized equipment to drain the water and retrieve whatever was in the lake.

As the water level dropped, the roof of the van emerged. It seemed they had switched vehicles and dumped the van here.

We pulled the van out, but it was completely clean. These people were well-trained and had strong counter-surveillance skills. Any evidence on the van had been washed away, leaving us with nothing to go on except the van's origin.

"However," Simon said, "there are thousands of similar vans in Skyview City."

Just as we hit a dead end, Paula sent me a message with a location.

She didn't say anything, just sent the location, but it immediately made me think of Kathy.

After hearing my information, Simon's expression relaxed a bit. "It's possible. Let's go to this address. We don't have any other leads right now."

Simon left a team to continue investigating the van, while the rest of us headed to the location Paula had sent.

Savannah and I went along. I couldn't bear the thought of Kathy being there alone, so we had to get there as soon as possible.

The location Paula sent was in an old industrial area.

The area was filled with abandoned factories and old residential buildings.

Only a few elderly people lived there now, making it a good place to hide someone. That was my first thought upon arriving.

It was already dark.

The old machinery left behind in the area looked like steel monsters in the darkness, making me increasingly uneasy, as if these steel monsters had swallowed Kathy.

I felt lost, not knowing where to start.

What if Paula's location was a trick? What if she wanted to mislead us and sent us in the wrong direction?

These thoughts swirled in my mind, making me more anxious.

The most crucial question was, how did Paula know Kathy's location? Was she still in contact with Renee and Brandon?

But no matter what I thought, this was our last lead, our only hope.

So, I had to trust Paula.

Simon looked around, his face grim.

Roy said to him, "This place is too big. Even if we search every building, we won't finish by morning. What do we do?"

Simon turned to me. "Caroline, can you call Paula? If she answers, our tech team can trace the call and maybe find Kathy's exact location."

I nodded quickly, but when I called, Paula answered for just a second before hanging up. After that, her phone was off.

I looked at the tech team next to Simon. They shook their heads. "The call was too short. We need a few seconds to trace it, but now that her phone is off, we can't locate her."

I looked at the shadowy buildings, feeling a sense of despair.

I sent Paula several messages: "How do you know about this? Where exactly is Kathy? We can't find her! If you know where she is, please reply."

Simon, his face dark, said, "Let's wait until morning. If we don't have any clear leads by then, we'll call in the police to surround the area. In daylight, we'll see anyone trying to escape."

We nodded. It seemed like our only option. If soft tactics didn't work, we'd have to use force.

My only worry was whether Paula's information was accurate. If we surrounded the area at dawn and Kathy wasn't there, she'd be in real danger.

It would mean we wasted a night chasing a false lead.

###chapter 162

The early morning sun slowly rose from the horizon, casting a warm glow over everything.

The golden sunlight made the old, run-down building shimmer.

Simon clenched his jaw and said, "We can't wait any longer. Call headquarters and get a squad car over here!"

Just then, my phone lit up. I quickly checked it. "Hold on, hold on! Paula just messaged me!"

Everyone froze, anxiously looking at me.

With trembling hands, I opened Paula's message.

She had sent me another location, this time more specific, down to the building and apartment number. But she still hadn't said a word.

I showed the police, and they quickly identified the exact location. "It's just ahead. Let's go!"

We all walked to the building.

When we arrived, we realized the building had six floors, with two apartments on each floor. We couldn't tell which one it was. If we knocked on the wrong door, we might alert the kidnappers.

I was physically and mentally exhausted, leaning against the iron gate, gasping for breath.

Savannah looked at me with concern. "Ms. Sharp, you should stay here. We'll go. Don't worry, we'll get Ms. Patel out."

I shook my head. "She's probably terrified right now, so I have to go with you."

"Don't worry, I'll be fine. I just need a moment to catch my breath."

Many of the apartments in this building were vacant, with a thick layer of dust at the entrances. This was our breakthrough point.

Simon whispered, "Check the footprints at the door. If there are many and they're messy, it's a key suspect. If the footprints are single and clear, it's just a regular resident. Be careful not to alert the kidnappers. We don't want them to do anything drastic."

The teams nodded and dispersed upstairs.

Simon went up with them.

Downstairs, it was just me and Savannah. She was there to protect me, and I didn't dare go up, fearing I might become a burden if something happened. It was better to stay put.

Soon, Savannah's walkie-talkie crackled. "There's something on the top floor. Top floor."

Savannah and I exchanged glances and hurried upstairs.

The other officers also got the message and gathered on the top floor. Despite the crowd, no one made a sound.

Strangely, both doors on this floor had messy footprints, making it impossible to determine which apartment Kathy was in. If we entered the wrong one, Kathy could be in danger.

Simon stared at the two doors for a long time before finally choosing one.

He signaled for everyone to hide, while he stood at the door with two officers out of sight.

Savannah and I hid downstairs, holding our breath.

Simon knocked lightly on the door, his tone sharp. "Anyone home? Water meter check!"

There was some noise inside, and after a while, a stranger opened the door. "What water meter? We haven't used any water."

Simon glared at him. "No water? My records show you have, and you need to pay the bill."

The man, clearly irritated by Simon's tone, pushed the door open. "What are you talking about?"

At that moment, the hidden officers rushed forward, pulling the door open, and Simon swiftly kicked the man in the head.

As the man fell, the officers stormed into the apartment.

Savannah and I watched from the stairs, hearing various noises from inside.

The most terrifying was the sound of gunfire, leaving us clueless about what was happening.

We exchanged worried glances, fearing something had gone wrong inside.

After several more gunshots, the apartment fell silent.

Simon emerged, carrying an unconscious Kathy.

I breathed a sigh of relief, rushing to her. "Kathy, Kathy, can you hear me?"

She didn't respond. Simon said, "We need to get her to the hospital immediately!"

I nodded, and Simon carried Kathy downstairs.

But just then, a police officer shouted, "Run! There's a bomb!"

Savannah tackled me to the ground, and a deafening explosion echoed through the building.

The iron gate was blown open, black smoke billowing from the apartment, and several officers ran out.

The explosion drew everyone's attention, and residents downstairs fled, calling 911.

Savannah and I were at a safe distance, but the blast knocked me out. When I came to, I pushed Savannah off me. She was unresponsive.

Terrified, I shook her. "Savannah, Savannah!"

She remained limp, but I felt her breath and knew she was alive. I stood up, draped her arm over my shoulder, and helped her downstairs.

Some officers were injured, and others carried the wounded out while securing the scene. The kidnappers were all dead.

I got Savannah downstairs, and the ambulance arrived.

Simon, hearing the explosion, rushed over. "Are you okay?"

I shook my head. "I'm fine, but Savannah passed out. Some officers are injured too."

Simon nodded. "Get them on the ambulance. We'll follow in the squad car."

The injured were loaded onto the ambulance, and I got into Simon's car. He floored it, following the ambulance to the hospital.

At the hospital, Kathy, Savannah, and the injured officers were rushed into the ER.

The ER was bustling, so we waited outside, anxious.

I was worried about both Savannah and Kathy. They were in danger because of me, and I felt incredibly guilty.

Simon's face was grim as he made frequent calls, clearly dealing with unresolved issues.

"Caroline, I have to go. We need to identify the bodies at the station. Take care of things here. I'll be back as soon as I can."

I nodded, urging him to go.

I could handle things here alone.

Unexpectedly, I saw Joanna at the hospital. She approached me.

"What happened?"

Knowing she was aware of the situation, I quickly explained.

###chapter 163

After I laid out the whole situation to Joanna, she got this serious look on her face, clearly grasping how bad things were.

"This is huge. These reckless idiots had the nerve to kidnap someone in broad daylight. Skyview City needs a serious cleanup."

I nodded, feeling a bit more at ease. If Joanna was on board, then this mess would definitely get sorted out.

A crackdown was a must. If we didn't act now, Skyview City would turn into a criminal playground.

And all this was happening under Earl and Renee's watch, so the first step was to take down those two troublemakers.

After what felt like an eternity waiting outside, the doctor finally came out to give me an update. "The short-haired woman isn't too badly hurt. She probably got knocked out by the blast wave outside, so she should wake up soon. But the long-haired woman inside was right at the center of the explosion and might have had a previous head injury. There's a blood clot in her brain, so we have to wait for it to dissolve before we can tell when she'll wake up. For now, she's still in a coma."

I clenched my fists, trying to wrap my head around what those people had done to Kathy.

Just then, Simon, who had left not long ago, called me.

"Earl and Renee showed up right when the explosion happened. They were at the hospital."

I was stunned. "Seriously?"

"Yeah, our surveillance caught them. They rushed in to check on Karen and then took off."

"I think they set up Kathy's kidnapping to distract us. We were short-staffed, so I had to pull people from the hospital to help."

I couldn't believe how twisted their plan was.

"Those bastards. Kathy still hasn't woken up. The doctor said it could take a while for the blood clot to dissolve."

"And Paula's probably in on it. She must be working with Renee and Earl. Otherwise, she wouldn't have messaged me right then. It was all too convenient."

Simon nodded. "You're right. We think Paula was trying to distract us so we'd all rush here, ignoring what was happening at the hospital."

"She did everything to lure us in, and they never intended to hurt Kathy. It was just to buy time for Earl and Renee."

"We have to find those two bastards, no matter what it takes."

"Kathy's injury can't be for nothing!"

Simon responded, "Don't worry, I won't let them get away with this. You take care of things here, and I'll join you as soon as I can."

After hanging up, I anxiously looked into the hospital room.

The medical staff were still busy tending to Savannah, Kathy, and the other injured people, cleaning their wounds.

Just then, I saw Savannah move her hand. I quickly went to her bedside. "Savannah, Savannah, how are you?"

Savannah slowly opened her eyes and looked at me. "Ms. Sharp, are you okay?"

Overwhelmed by the tension and worry, I couldn't help but cry. "Why did you protect me like that? You're so young, you have a family. You shouldn't have done that!"

"If something happened to you, how could I face your family?"

I couldn't stop crying. Savannah weakly smiled. "Don't cry, Ms. Sharp. I'm fine. Look, I'm strong. A little explosion is nothing."

"Besides, it's my duty. Don't cry."

She lifted her hand with the IV to try and wipe my tears, making me cry even harder.

At that moment, Joanna walked in with a bunch of supplies. "She's awake? I brought some things that might be useful since there are a lot of patients here."

"Could you take care of them for a bit? I have a business meeting soon."

I took the supplies from Joanna and thanked her repeatedly. "Thank you, Ms. Thorne. I'll handle things here. Someone else will come to help soon."

Joanna nodded. "I know the situation here. I'll talk to my dad and make sure the police investigate thoroughly. Even though our systems are separate, my dad has some influence. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this."

I thanked her sincerely. After Joanna left, Savannah looked at me. "Ms. Sharp, I'm thirsty."

I quickly took out a bottle of water Joanna had bought and carefully helped Savannah drink.

After drinking, she looked much better. Earlier, her face had been so pale it scared me.

Savannah leaned back on the bed and glanced at Kathy. "How's Ms. Patel?"

I looked at the medical staff still working on Kathy and shook my head. "The doctor said there's a blood clot in her brain. We have to wait for it to dissolve before she can wake up."

Savannah sighed. "Ms. Patel is such a good person. How did she end up with these bastards?"

I nodded.

Soon after, Simon returned, having finished his tasks.

He asked about Kathy's condition.

I shook my head and relayed what the doctor had told me.

Simon looked serious.

After treating their wounds, the doctor arranged for Savannah and Kathy to be moved to another room. We requested that they share a room to make it easier to care for them.

Savannah, having been in the military and not seriously injured, recovered quickly.

Now, only Kathy remained in a coma. Her eyelashes would occasionally flutter, making her look like she was just sleeping.

But we knew there was no set time for her to wake up, so we could only wait.

We stayed by Kathy's side for two days.

Since Savannah had just recovered, Simon and I didn't let her help. We took turns watching over Kathy. During this time, we gave Kathy glucose to keep her strength up and occasionally fed her water. She could swallow on her own, but she just wouldn't wake up.

After three days, we were getting anxious and asked the doctor when Kathy would wake up.

###chapter 164

The doctor looked confused. "The blood clot in her brain wasn't that big, and it's already been absorbed. But for some reason, she hasn't woken up. I think the explosion and the kidnapping might have really shaken her up. I suggest you call her name often."

"She might be in a self-protective coma because of the trauma. Calling her name could help her wake up faster."

Simon and I nodded. Back in the hospital room, I sat by her bed, gently patting her shoulder. "Kathy, Kathy, wake up."

Simon leaned against the wall, watching.

Savannah came in with some food and placed it on the table. "Still not awake?"

I shook my head and kept calling her name.

Just then, Simon noticed Kathy's hand move. "Her hand moved! Keep calling her, it's working!"

Excited, I continued, "Kathy, you need to get up! Someone wants to order custom clothes from you. It's a big deal, worth a year's revenue!"

Kathy's long eyelashes fluttered. She seemed to be waking up, her hand movements becoming more pronounced.

Simon quickly went to get the doctor.

I grabbed Kathy's hand, watching her intently.

Her eyes moved under her eyelids, and then she slowly opened them. Her gaze was unfocused.

The doctor came in, checked her with a stethoscope. "Her heartbeat and pulse are normal. Waking up is a good sign, but start with light food and no water yet. We'll monitor her."

I kept calling her name. "Kathy? Kathy?"

Her eyes gradually focused, and she turned her head slightly to look at me.

I couldn't help but cry. "You finally woke up. You scared me to death, you know?"

Kathy's first words were, "I'm so hungry."

Savannah and I laughed through our tears. "Of course you're hungry! You haven't eaten in three or four days. You've been on IV fluids."

"I'll ask the doctor when you can eat. We'll get you some porridge, okay?"

Kathy nodded, still a bit groggy from just waking up.

Simon stood at the foot of her bed, waving. "Ms. Patel, Ms. Patel? Do you remember me?"

"Did you lose your memory?"

I knew he was teasing her. Kathy's eyes moved faster, and she weakly glared at him. "Get lost!"

Her voice was hoarse and weak, but the fact that she could still curse was a good sign.

By evening, Kathy had recovered quite a bit. Following the doctor's advice, we fed her porridge, spoonful by spoonful.

Kathy leaned against the pillow, still a bit dizzy.

Once she could talk, she started venting. "You guys have no idea how scared I was that day. I felt like someone was following me. When I hid in my studio, I saw the door had been tampered with. I thought someone was already inside, so I hid in the back alley."

"But there were people in the alley too!"

Kathy got so worked up that she lifted her head quickly, then immediately fell back, holding her head and complaining of dizziness.

We couldn't help but laugh. I fed her more porridge. "Can you stay still? Just lie down."

"I could hear you guys talking these past few days, but I just couldn't wake up. It was driving me crazy."

"What happened to those bastards?"

I looked at Simon. He said, "They all died in the explosion."

Kathy nodded angrily. "Serves them right. They put me through hell. Why kidnap me? What did I ever do to them?"

"The leader caught me when I was trying to escape. I had almost freed my hands, but he saw me and hit me with a stick. It hurt so much."

After finishing the porridge, Kathy sighed in satisfaction. "They didn't even give me food. This is the first meal I've had in days."

"When I get better, I'm going to eat so much barbecue."

Seeing her think about food even in this situation, I felt relieved. She was really okay.

Kathy asked curiously, "How did you find me?"

"I didn't even know where they took me. They put a black bag over my head and threw away my phone. I thought you'd never find me unless you were God."

I explained our guesses and how we found her.

She was surprised. "Paula? I never expected that."

"Didn't you notice who kidnapped you?"

Kathy shook her head. "How could I? They kept a black bag over my head. I only saw them when I tried to escape, but then I got knocked out."

After eating, we chatted for a while. Kathy suddenly felt very sleepy, which scared us. We thought she might fall into a coma again.

The doctor reassured us it was normal. Her brain injury meant sleep was a way to heal, so we let her sleep.

Not long after Kathy fell asleep, Joanna arrived with some gifts. "Didn't she wake up? Why is she asleep again?"

We explained, and she nodded, sitting down to look at Kathy. "She really had a close call. Maybe she'll have good luck after this."

We all nodded, hoping it was true.

We didn't tell Aurelia about Kathy's injury. She's pregnant, and we didn't want to worry her.

Joanna stayed for a while, then left, leaving us to watch over Kathy.

Thankfully, Kathy woke up soon after, just normal sleep this time.

She looked much better, her face more vibrant, even her lips had color.

Seeing her like this, I finally felt at ease, knowing she was truly okay.

But one thing still puzzled me. Why did they target Kathy, and how did they know she was back in Skyview City?

###chapter 165

As soon as Kathy woke up, I couldn't wait to ask her the question.

Kathy looked annoyed. "Don't even get me started. It was my own fault for getting caught."

"Wasn't Brandon supposed to be with Maeve at a hotel? I was so mad, I decided to stake out the place. Sure enough, I saw them go in again."

"So I thought I'd snap a few more photos. But just as I saw Brandon enter the hotel, the next second he was right beside my car."

We all exchanged glances, stunned.

"Forget whether it's possible or not, it sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie."

"Exactly. At first, I couldn't believe it either. I thought I must have been mistaken. But it was definitely Brandon. He was standing by my car window, knocking and asking me to get out."

Kathy shuddered at the memory. "Of course, I couldn't get out. That would have confirmed I was stalking him. So I rolled down the window and asked him what he was doing there."

She vividly described the scene. "Brandon looked at me suspiciously and asked if I had seen anything."

I looked at her. "What did you say?"

"Of course, I said I hadn't seen anything. What if he kidnapped me on the spot if I admitted it?"

"I told him I was there to meet a friend and asked him what he was doing there. He said he was meeting a client. I knew he was lying, but I didn't dare call him out."

"Luckily, I hadn't taken any photos. Otherwise, it would have been a whole different story if he saw them."

"I guess that's when Brandon realized I was back in Skyview City. If your plan is what you say it is, that's when he factored me into it."

I nodded. "You're right. Looking back, Brandon and Maeve going to the hotel might have been a ruse. Brandon usually respects Karen. No matter how much of a jerk he is, he wouldn't be fooling around at such a critical time."

"So there must have been someone else at the hotel. They used the hotel as a cover to meet someone."

Simon snapped his fingers. "You're right. That's definitely the answer."

Savannah asked, puzzled, "So who were they meeting that was worth risking the company's reputation?"

Simon and I exchanged a glance and said in unison, "Earl."

"If Renee and her crew have a mole in our police force, they would know Earl is now our prime suspect in the Jason case. So he wouldn't show his face in public. The only person worth all this trouble for Brandon and Maeve to meet would be him."

"It seems they haven't fallen out. They're still thick as thieves."

I couldn't help but smirk. Brandon's recent display of anger and dissatisfaction with Earl was all an act. This family really knows how to put on a show.

"So, is it possible Earl is still in Skyview City?"

"After all, Karen isn't dead yet. Wouldn't he want to see her one last time?"

Simon shook his head. "Not sure. We had people block all exits from the city on the day of the explosion. We checked the airport and train stations for any sign of Earl."

"If Earl shows up, we'll know right away. But so far, nothing."

"So, I think he's still in Skyview City. Worst case, he's already slipped out quietly. If that's the case, catching him will be a lot harder."

The atmosphere in the hospital room grew heavy. We all understood the gravity of the situation.

If Earl had indeed fled abroad, it would mean Jason's murder might go unresolved, and we would have no way to catch him.

Simon suddenly tried to lighten the mood. "Don't worry too much. Our police system is pretty advanced. If we haven't found him, it means he's still in Skyview City. We'll find a way to catch him."

We nodded, hoping he was right.

After talking all morning, we were all a bit hungry. Savannah and I decided to go out and get some food.

Kathy needed rest, so she quickly lay back down.

Savannah took me to a well-known soup restaurant nearby to get some nourishing food for Kathy.

But we ran into the last person we expected-Brandon.

As soon as we got out of the car, we saw Brandon getting out of his car across the street. He looked surprised to see me.

"Wife? What are you doing back here?"

"Kathy's in such bad shape. How could I not come back? She's seriously ill. As soon as I heard, I rushed back. Why didn't you tell me?"

Brandon hesitated for a couple of seconds before feigning surprise. "Kathy? What's wrong with her? I didn't know she was sick."

His surprise was clearly an act. I couldn't help but scoff. "Don't tell me you don't know about the recent explosion. Kathy was kidnapped."

"I really didn't know. If I had, I would have gone to see her. How is she now?"

"She just woke up. She's doing okay. We're getting her some food. What are you doing here?"

"Uh... I'm meeting a client."

His hesitant tone made it obvious he was lying, but I couldn't call him out on it now. I just nodded.

"By the way, what's with the rumors about you and Maeve online? Do you know how much the company's stock has dropped? I rushed back partly because of Kathy and partly because of this."

"Didn't I tell you not to let your personal issues affect the company?"

Brandon was taken aback and quickly apologized. "Wife, wife, you misunderstood. There's nothing between Maeve and me. The media is just making things up. I'm already planning to sue them."

"I wasn't lying to you before. You're the only woman I'll ever have. I don't know where the media got the idea that Maeve and I went to a hotel."

"Don't worry. Once the investigation is over, I'll give you the truth. The company's stock will recover. Trust me, wife."

He seemed confident because he believed he hadn't gone to the hotel with Maeve.

I stared into his eyes. "If you didn't go to the hotel, what were you two doing there?"

"Meeting a client. Maeve introduced me to a client she's close with. I thought going together might help build a rapport."

###chapter 166

Brandon's lying skills have really hit a new high. If I didn't already know the truth, I'd be totally fooled.

I chuckled lightly. "Alright, I believe you wouldn't pull something like that while your mom's seriously ill. Aren't you meeting a client? You should get going."

Brandon nodded. "By the way, babe, are you coming home to sleep tonight?"

I waved my hand dismissively. "Not sure. Kathy needs someone with her right now, so I'll be staying in her hospital room."

"Okay, just give me a call when you're coming back."

I looked at him and asked, "Why? Are you worried I'll catch you with another woman, so you're making preparations in advance?"

"Babe, what are you talking about? I would never do that. I just want to get things ready. Since you left, I haven't had anyone clean your room. I wanted to call the maid to tidy it up."

I nodded and let him leave.

Savannah and I went to a restaurant to grab some takeout. We saw Brandon enter the restaurant across the street and get led to a private room by a waiter.

I gave Savannah a look, and she quickly understood, sneaking into the restaurant across the street.

I waited in our restaurant, and soon Savannah returned, showing me her phone.

The photo she took was of a completely unfamiliar man. He was thin and frail, wearing a shirt and looking quite scholarly, but his head was disproportionately large, with gold-rimmed glasses that gave him an eerie, doll-like appearance.

His eyes, hidden behind the glasses, lacked their sharpness. If you looked closely, you'd feel a chill, as if there was a hint of malice in them.

"Ms. Sharp, do you know this person?" Savannah asked.

I shook my head. "No, but if Brandon is meeting him at such a critical time, it means this person is important. Let's have Simon look into it."

Savannah nodded, and we got into the car and headed back to the hospital.

In the hospital room, only Kathy was there, looking at her phone.

When she saw us, she happily said, "You're back! I was starving."

I looked around and asked, "Where's Simon? I need to talk to him."

"He said he had some work at the police station and left. He should be back tonight."

I nodded, thinking it wasn't urgent. He must be busy, so I could show him the photo later.

I placed the food on the table. "Let's eat. You must be starving."

Kathy nodded. "I just realized that glucose doesn't fill you up at all. The more I get, the hungrier I feel."

Savannah and I couldn't help but laugh. "Whoever said glucose water could fill you up? If that were the case, we'd all just get glucose and skip meals."

Kathy stuck out her tongue, and Savannah and I adjusted her bed so she could sit up and eat.

As we ate, I told them about running into Brandon earlier.

Kathy rolled her eyes. "Even if he didn't hook up with Maeve this time, he's still no good. They're both bad news."

"I don't believe they're innocent."

I smiled. "I actually believe Brandon this time. There's no way they're involved."

Kathy looked at me in surprise. "Caroline, are you nuts? How can you trust that jerk Brandon?"

Savannah and I exchanged a knowing look and smiled. "Because Brandon can't do anything right now."

"What do you mean?"

"Brandon was diagnosed with syphilis recently, and Royce did something to him. Now Brandon can't get it up at all."

Kathy's eyes widened. "Really? Well, serves him right!"

"Exactly. That's why I believe Brandon. He probably doesn't even dare take his pants off in front of a woman now."

We all shared a knowing look, amusement in our eyes.

Just then, the subject of our conversation knocked on the hospital room door. "What are you all talking about that's so funny?"

Brandon stood at the door in a gray suit, looking polished but deceitful.

Kathy rolled her eyes, remembering the trouble he'd caused her recently.

But since I was still his wife, I couldn't be too obvious. "Kathy's able to eat now and isn't feeling as dizzy. We're happy. What brings you here?"

"I finished meeting the client and thought I'd drop by to see you. I heard Kathy had an accident and hadn't visited yet. I'm really sorry."

"Don't bother. You should go see Karen. I heard she's sick, and you still have time for other things?"

Kathy was always blunt, and Brandon didn't dare confront her. He gritted his teeth. "What are you talking about? What does this have to do with Karen? And the thing with Maeve is just a rumor."

"Anyway, my wife believes me. Ask her if you don't believe me."

I had to nod. "Yes, I believe Brandon. He wouldn't have time for such nonsense when Karen is seriously ill. That would make him a real jerk."

"What kind of jerk would do that? Brandon isn't that kind of person."

Brandon's expression was strange, unable to tell if I was insulting or praising him.

"By the way, honey, you should visit Mom. She was asking about you recently."

"I know you didn't get along with her before, but Karen is sick. You should visit her. Otherwise, people will think the Jordan family has no family values."

I couldn't help but laugh coldly. "Family values? When your mom favored Jason and ignored Brett, did she think about family values?"

"Brett didn't get depressed because of her. Otherwise, I wouldn't let it go."

"Be glad I haven't visited. Otherwise, I might say something that would make her have a stroke. What then?"

Brandon was getting angry. "Honey, what kind of grudge do you have? She's your mom. She's done a lot for this family. You can't talk like that."

"She's your mom, not mine. My mom is in Suncrest City."

"And what effort did she make? How did she handle the Elora situation? She thought Elora was your wife. Did she ever take me seriously?"

I glared at Brandon. "Is that what you call effort?"

"She didn't make me a laughingstock in all of Skyview City, and that's saying something!"

###chapter 167

My words were harsh, but Brandon knew he was in the wrong and couldn't argue back. His face looked awful.

"Why don't you just go back to her? What are you hanging around here for?"

"Not dealing with her is already the best outcome. What more do you want from me?"

Brandon gritted his teeth and finally said slowly, "Fine, honey, you should head home early."

I waved him off impatiently.

After he left, Kathy couldn't help but laugh at me. "You really know how to get under Brandon's skin. Did you see his face when he left? He looked like he was about to explode."

I chuckled. "I just told the truth, and he couldn't handle it? If he doesn't want people to talk, then his mom shouldn't be doing such things. Am I wrong?"

Kathy nodded and gave me a thumbs up. "I'm afraid if you two don't get divorced soon, he'll die from anger first."

"That would be ideal. Wouldn't I be doing everyone a favor by getting rid of Brandon? Karen's almost gone too. Now it's just Renee, Earl, and Irene left."

I listed their names, feeling a surge of anger just thinking about them. One day, I'll make sure they all pay.

The Jordans are all bad people, not a single one deserves any sympathy.

After dinner, we stayed in Kathy's hospital room for a while, chatting. Later that evening, Simon arrived.

He was in a hurry, clearly having rushed over right after finishing work, with sweat still on his forehead.

"I told you not to rush. We're still here, aren't we?"

"Any leads on Earl these past few days?"

Simon shook his head. "No, and we can't trace the bombers who died either. No one has claimed their bodies, so we don't even know who they are."

"Could they be foreigners? Kathy, did you hear them speak?"

Kathy nodded, then shook her head. "I only heard the leader speak. The others were silent. It's possible they were foreigners."

Simon frowned. "We suspect that too, but if they are foreigners, it will be much harder to trace. It might end up being a dead end."

"Looks like using this lead to convict the Jordans is going to be tough. These people are desperate criminals. Who knows where he found them?"

I nodded, already used to this.

Suddenly, I remembered the photo Savannah took earlier today. I quickly took it out and handed it to Simon. "Savannah and I ran into Brandon while we were out getting food. He knows I'm back, but he was meeting a client, so he didn't join us. This is the client he met. Do you recognize him?"

Simon took the photo and slowly shook his head. "No, but I'll take it back and check. If he met Brandon at such a critical time, he must be important."

I nodded. "That's what I thought too. This guy's identity might be significant."

Simon snapped a picture of the photo and sent it to the tech team.

"Now we just wait for them to get back to us. Let's see who this guy is."

That night, Simon stayed with Kathy, while Savannah and I went to a nearby hotel.

We hadn't had a full night's sleep in days, and we had been using nearby hotels to quickly freshen up before rushing back. We were really short on people and couldn't afford to be away for long.

Now that Simon was here, Savannah and I could finally rest.

We found a hotel nearby.

I let Savannah shower first while I checked our company's stock. The stock had plummeted due to the negative press, wiping out tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars in market value.

Brandon was probably losing his mind, not knowing how to handle it.

As for his reassurances, they were just excuses. I knew his capabilities. He couldn't handle this; it was beyond him.

After Savannah and I cleaned up, we got some sleep.

In the morning, Brandon texted me, asking me to come home.

I had a feeling something was up, so I deliberately took my time with Savannah, eating some food in Kathy's room before slowly driving home.

When I got home, Brandon was visibly impatient, wanting to say something but not daring to. He frowned. "Honey, where have you been? Didn't I ask you to come home quickly?"

"What's the matter?"

"I told you, Kathy is sick and needs someone with her. Shouldn't I be there?"

"Couldn't you have said this over the phone?"

Brandon was at a loss for words, his temper flaring. "I just wanted to see you sooner. Honey, don't be mad. I have something to tell you."

Just as I suspected, Brandon had a reason for calling me back. His intentions were clear.

I sat on the couch. "What is it?"

Brandon suddenly knelt in front of me. "Honey, the company is going under. Please save it."

"I know Dad left you some shares. Those shares are worth a lot. We don't have any other money to save the company. Can you sell those shares and invest in the company?"

"Otherwise, the company will go bankrupt. Are you really going to watch the company you built from scratch go under?"

I scoffed. "What does that have to do with me? Isn't it your fault the company is in this state?"

"You have the nerve to ask for the money my dad left me? Can't you find investors yourself?"

"But no one dares to invest in us now. With everything that's happened, who would want to work with us? Even our overseas connections will cut ties once they find out."

"Didn't you say you could handle it? Hold a press conference and clear things up. Can't you do that?"

"But the company is on the brink. Even if I hold a press conference, it won't help the stock price. Honey, you're the only one who can help me. Please, save our company."

"If you don't help, I don't know who else to turn to. The company is really in crisis."

He kept calling it "our company," but in reality, he had filled it with his relatives.

I couldn't help but laugh. "Our company? Brandon, are you sure?"

"Isn't the company filled with your Jordan family members? What does it have to do with me? Didn't you fire all my trusted people?"

###chapter 168

Brandon blurted out, "Babe, don't stress. Once this whole mess is sorted, I'll kick those freeloaders out. They're just dead weight, not helping the company at all."

"And I'll bring back our old key employees with better pay. Please, babe, just help me out this time. I swear it won't happen again."

I scoffed, "I don't buy it. You didn't even ask me when you brought those people in. Now that the company's in trouble, you suddenly remember me? How shameless can you be?"

"Your whole Jordan family is rotten. You took advantage of my illness to try and take over my company, didn't you? Well, let me tell you, no way!"

Brandon's face darkened, and he gritted his teeth. "Don't talk like that. I brought them in for the company's growth. I never expected things to get this bad."

"For the company's growth?" I laughed coldly. "Brandon, do you even hear yourself? Do you know what your family is like? Has Irene ever run a big corporation? And Earl is just an uneducated fool. Does anyone in your family have any real skills? And you talk about company growth."

"Stop making excuses. I'm not giving you any money! Get out!"

Brandon's eyes turned cold. "Caroline, we're still married. You can't be this heartless."

"I've treated you well in this marriage, haven't I? I've always been the one to apologize, to take your insults. You can insult me, but you insult my family too? Do you even see me as your husband?"

I laughed bitterly. "Did you ever see me as your wife? You've been involved with so many women, even had a child with one. What do you take me for?"

"Brandon, let me tell you, what I've done to you is nothing compared to what you've done to me."

He gritted his teeth, his eyes bloodshot as he glared at me. "So there's no room for negotiation?"

"None. Get out!"

"You caused this mess, you fix it. I won't help you. Even if the company goes bankrupt, we'll just get divorced, and I'll go back to Suncrest City."

"Caroline, take that back."

Brandon glared at me, his teeth clenched.

I laughed coldly. "What, are you going to do something to me? You can't even manage a company, you loser."

"Take it back!"

He suddenly roared at me, his eyes red like a beast's, panting heavily as he glared at me.

I was startled but quickly recovered. I slapped Brandon hard. "How dare you yell at me?"

Brandon seemed to snap, grabbing my neck viciously. "You bitch, I've been so good to you, and now you won't even help me. Why don't you just die!"

He had completely lost his mind, squeezing my neck like a madman.

"Die, die! Once you're gone, all your money will be mine, and I can save the company!"

I couldn't breathe, desperately clawing at Brandon's hand that was choking me.

"Brandon... let go," I struggled to say.

But he was like a man possessed. "I'll kill you, I'll kill you, then no one will look down on me anymore. I've had enough of your Sharp family's arrogance. Why do you look down on me?"

"I've worked like a dog for your family, managing the company for you. Why do you look down on me? Die, die!"

Just as I was about to lose consciousness, a figure burst through the door and kicked Brandon in the head.

Brandon flew across the room, crashing into a large potted plant.

He was covered in shards, his hands bloody.

Brandon glared at Savannah with bloodshot eyes. "How dare you hit me? I'll kill you both!"

He lunged at Savannah, but she wasn't one to mess with. Another kick sent Brandon flying.

This time he crashed into the coffee table. It didn't break, but he was hurt badly, rolling on the floor like a pig, unable to get up.

I clutched my neck, glaring at Brandon, gasping for air.

I knew Brandon really wanted to kill me. His eyes terrified me.

Luckily, I had Savannah waiting outside. Otherwise, who knows what might have happened.

I grabbed an ashtray from the table and smashed it over Brandon's head, making him bleed.

Brandon clutched his head, screaming in pain. "Caroline, how dare you hit me? Are you even human?"

"How am I not human? You almost killed me!"

I kept hitting him with the ashtray, his face and head soon covered in blood, looking even more terrifying.

Brandon tried to fight back, but Savannah stepped on his hand. "Move, and I'll break your fingers. My job is to protect Ms. Sharp. You touch her, and I'll break two of your fingers. Try me."

I looked at Brandon and sneered. "Don't forget, we have money. For every finger she breaks, I'll pay you. Let's see if you can afford it."

Realizing something, Brandon suddenly got up, coughing violently.

I threw the ashtray on the ground, looking down at Brandon. "If you dare hit me, this isn't over. We're definitely getting divorced. With your illegitimate child and mistresses, I'll make sure you leave with nothing. Just wait."

I turned to leave, and Brandon, coming to his senses, grabbed my leg. "Honey, I'm sorry. I was just angry. I never meant to hurt you!"

"Please, give me another chance. I didn't mean it, honey."

"We have three kids. We can't get divorced. Please forgive me, I was wrong!"

I kicked him away. "Get out! This time, we're definitely getting divorced!"

He tried to follow me, but Savannah stood in his way.

###chapter 169

Brandon was losing it. He knew he couldn't take on Savannah, so he just stood there in the living room, fuming.

"I really messed up. Please, for the kids' sake, forgive me. I didn't mean it."

"From now on, I'll do whatever you say. I'll hand over the company to you, just don't divorce me. I'll agree to anything. I'll get rid of those people, fire anyone you don't like at the company. Please, honey?"

"Just don't divorce me, I'm begging you!"

He suddenly dropped to his knees, pleading with me.

I scoffed, "Brandon, don't think I don't know about all the dirty things you've done behind my back."

"Tell me, after I gave birth to Yves and Aria and was in a coma for a while, what happened?"

Brandon stayed silent, guilt flashing across his face.

"I really don't know, honey. Weren't you just sick?"

"Don't think I don't know. I went to the hospital later and found out the medication you gave me was harmful to my body, making my condition worse!"

"Was this your doing? Were you trying to kill me to take back the company for the Jordan family? So you could become a spotless, prestigious family?"

Brandon finally panicked, realizing I knew the truth. "Honey, it wasn't my idea. It was Shirley's. She wanted to harm you. It had nothing to do with me."

I knew he'd try to pin the blame on someone else. I lost even more respect for him. If he had just admitted it, I might have respected him as a man.

"Did you not know about the drugs Shirley gave me? Don't tell me you had no idea. This was all Shirley's doing?"

"Don't think I don't have evidence. If I didn't have enough proof, would I be saying this? I have enough evidence to put you in jail, Brandon."

He fell to the ground, banging his head. "Honey, I was wrong. It was my fault. I was bewitched by Shirley. I'll never do anything like this again."

"Do you really want our three kids to grow up without a father and see our family fall apart?"

"Let it fall apart. I stopped caring about this family a long time ago."

"I've already talked to the kids. They all agree with the divorce. Now get out!"

My tone was firm, and no matter what he said, I wouldn't budge. Brandon stopped pretending, stood up, and wiped the blood off his face.

"Caroline, don't even think about divorcing me. It's never going to happen. You'll be stuck with me for life. Let's see who outlasts who."

"I have ways to keep us tied together forever. Let's see what you do then."

"And be careful not to die before me, or all your assets will be mine."

His words were a blatant threat. I sneered, "We'll see who outlasts who. Just wait and see."

"Haven't you noticed? Everyone connected to you is dying. Jason's gone, your mom's gone. You're next."

He gritted his teeth and took a step forward, but Savannah blocked him, pointing at him. "What do you think you're doing?"

Brandon, clearly afraid of Savannah, took a couple of steps back. "Caroline, just wait. We'll grow old together."

He said it through gritted teeth, his bloody face making the threat even more terrifying.

I rolled my eyes and signaled to Savannah before turning to leave.

Grow old together? Yeah, right.

I took Savannah back to the hotel.

Now that I'd torn things apart with Brandon, I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders, but I was still worried. I didn't know what this mad dog might do next.

So I called Royce. He should still be in Suncrest City. "Hey, are you still in Suncrest City?"

Royce answered, "Yeah, what's up?"

"I'm heading back to Skyview City in a couple of days. I know the situation there, and I'll handle it. Don't worry."

"That's not it. I just had a huge fight with Brandon. We really went at it."

"I told him I want a divorce, but I'm worried he might do something to my mom. Can you help protect her and the kids? I'm afraid he might..."

Before I could finish, Royce understood. "Don't worry. I'll increase security around them. Even if you hadn't asked, I was already planning on it."

His words reassured me. Royce was always reliable.

I thanked him, "Without you, I wouldn't know what to do about my mom. She's my weak spot, and Brandon is hard to deal with because he doesn't care about anyone. He has no heart."

Royce nodded. "Of course. I'll make sure she's safe. And you need to be careful too. I'll be back in Skyview City soon."

For some reason, his promise made me feel much more at ease.

After hanging up, Savannah said, "Ms. Sharp, the bath is ready. Why don't you take a soak and relax?"

I nodded and went to the bathroom, sinking into the hot water.

In the mirror opposite the tub, the bruises on my neck were glaringly obvious, turning even redder in the steam.

These marks were like my ten-year marriage, always held by an invisible hand, leaving scars over time. But now, it was time to remove that hand.

I got out of the bath.

Savannah saw the marks on my neck and was shocked. She hadn't expected them to become so visible after the bath. What were faint bruises before were now fully revealed, with clear handprints.

Savannah gritted her teeth. "That bastard. I'll kill him myself one day."

"Ms. Sharp, do you need me to get some ointment for you?"

I shook my head. "No, this is a reminder to never go soft again. We're in this for the long haul. From today, we're officially at war with Brandon. Get ready."

Savannah nodded firmly. "Don't worry, Ms. Sharp. I'm always on your side."

With Savannah, Royce, Simon, and Kathy's help, I was confident I could win this battle.

As for Brandon's threats, I no longer took them seriously. To me, he was just a useless drunk.

###chapter 170

The real power behind the scenes was Renee.

Maybe Renee was the true head of the Jordan family, and Brandon was just a puppet, a useless figurehead pushed to the forefront.

After my bath, I asked Savannah to help me get in touch with Travis. I planned to meet him.

Savannah nodded and quickly got to work.

Not long after, she came back and said, "Mr. Franklin, he's flying into Skyview City at 2 PM the day after tomorrow. Does that work for you?"

I nodded.

In the meantime, I could rest and think about my next move against Brandon.

I instructed Savannah, "Sell my current villa. It's still under my name. I can't let Brandon get any advantage over me."

Savannah nodded.

In the following days, I continued my routine of visiting Kathy at the hospital from the hotel.

To avoid worrying her, I wore a scarf to cover the marks on my neck whenever I went to the hospital.

I simply told her that I had decided to get a divorce.

Kathy looked delighted, "You should have divorced that jerk a long time ago. I don't know how you put up with him for ten years. If it were me, I would have kicked him out ages ago."

"There's no way he would have gotten this far without you."

Seeing her so animated made me smile, "Alright, leave this to me. Your main focus should be on getting better and getting out of here soon, okay?"

Kathy nodded, leaning back on her hospital bed, "Don't worry, I'll get out of here soon and fight alongside you."

As I was leaving, I ran into Simon. He had taken time off to take care of Kathy, which freed up some time for me to handle my own affairs.

I told him about my divorce from Brandon, "You need to stay close to Kathy at all times. I'm worried that if Brandon loses his mind, he might come to the hospital and do something to her."

Simon nodded, "Don't worry, I'll make sure he leaves the same way he came."

I had complete faith in Simon's abilities, so after giving him these instructions, I left with Savannah.

A car had been following us closely, keeping a watchful eye on me.

Savannah asked, "Ms. Sharp, should we lose that car?"

I glanced at the rearview mirror. It was an ordinary car, the kind that blends into traffic, but it had been tailing us persistently. It was clear that Brandon had sent it.

I shook my head, "No, the more openly we act, the less they'll understand our plans. Just leave it."

When Kathy and I entered the hotel, the car stopped but didn't follow us inside, likely to avoid being noticed.

Little did they know, we had already spotted them.

Brandon's so-called cleverness was useless against us.

Savannah noted the car's license plate and reported it to Simon, who contacted his colleagues to investigate. We soon got results.

The car was registered to someone named Finnegan, a name that hadn't appeared in Brandon's social circle or company.

Simon said he was looking into the connection between Finnegan and Brandon, but it would take some time.

On the day Travis arrived, the car was still tailing us, but we didn't let it bother us.

Savannah drove skillfully, making several turns to shake the car off.

We arrived at our usual meeting spot, a place so secret that Brandon's team couldn't possibly figure it out.

I hurried into the private room where Travis was already waiting. He shook my hand, "Ms. Sharp, long time no see. You look much better."

I smiled, "Well, good news does that. I've decided to divorce Brandon, and I want to make sure he leaves with nothing. Can you help me with that?"

"Legally, for him to leave with nothing, we need proof of infidelity or other violations of marital safety," Travis explained.

I nodded, "I understand. I've prepared some evidence. Can you see if any of it is useful?"

"And what about the recent scandal of him and Maeve at the hotel? Can't that be used as evidence?"

Travis shook his head, "It can't be used as direct evidence without concrete proof of infidelity."

I nodded, not disappointed, and handed over all the evidence I had gathered against Brandon.

Travis carefully selected a few key pieces, including a recording of a conversation I had with Brandon after our fight.

"This recording is crucial. Since you're a party to the conversation, it can be used as key evidence."

"Most importantly, Brandon's actions in this recording, including infidelity and plotting against you, make it highly likely that he will leave with nothing."

I nodded, "The most important thing is to ensure the kids don't end up with him. I need custody of all three children."

"Don't worry, we'll work on that together."

With Travis's assurance, I felt relieved. He was one of the top lawyers in Skyview City.

After discussing the details of the divorce, Travis had to leave.

I saw him off and took a deep breath, feeling a weight lift off my chest.

I had finally taken the step towards divorce.

Six months ago, I couldn't have imagined this. I thought I was the happiest person in the world, with a loving husband and three adorable kids. Divorce was the last thing on my mind.

But in just six months, my life had changed drastically.

Still, I didn't regret uncovering the truth.

After my meeting with Travis, I got into Savannah's car to leave. As we merged onto the main road, the car that had been following us reappeared. It seemed they had been waiting nearby.

Just then, I received a call from Simon, "We don't know if the person in the car is Finnegan. The car is registered to him, but he was reported missing years ago."

"We suspect Finnegan's disappearance is connected to the driver. They must have bought the car under a missing person's name for a reason."

###chapter 171

I nodded and glanced at the rearview mirror. "Alright, got it. I'll call the cops now and have them look for this car."

Maybe they realized we were about to call the police, because the car behind us suddenly slowed down and eventually disappeared into the traffic.

But we had already memorized the license plate. If it showed up again, we could report it anytime.

Savannah was driving, taking me back to the hotel.

Just then, I felt a strong jolt from behind. I turned around in surprise and saw a Jeep ramming into the back of our car.

I was stunned and quickly looked at Savannah. "Did someone just rear-end us?"

Savannah shook her head. "No, I think it was on purpose."

"They had no reason to rear-end us just now. They appeared out of nowhere and aimed straight for our car. With so many cars around, they chose a precise angle to hit us. It has to be intentional. They want to crash into us."

I nodded. "No matter what, keep driving. I want to see how far they'll follow us."

Savannah floored the gas pedal, trying to shake off the car behind us. But the Jeep kept up, sticking close and occasionally bumping into our rear.

The constant jolts and Savannah's sudden braking were making me feel nauseous.

I couldn't help but glance back.

The Jeep was still tailing us, hitting us repeatedly.

We were in a remote area, not in the city, so they were being reckless.

I suddenly realized this was Brandon's doing, trying to stage an accident.

I smirked. His tactics were still too amateurish. As long as I wasn't dead, this would be my leverage.

I said in a low voice, "Speed up and lose them!"

Savannah nodded and pressed the gas pedal harder. The car smoothly navigated the curves, leaving the Jeep behind.

The driver of the Jeep seemed surprised by Savannah's driving skills.

They tried to catch up but always fell just a bit short.

After a while, they seemed to get frustrated and floored their gas pedal out of anger.

Savannah did the same, and the two cars started racing down the road.

I gripped the handle tightly, feeling my heart race.

Savannah warned me to hold on tight and not move, as we could be thrown off at any moment.

I nodded.

The two cars continued to chase each other down the road, and it was hard to tell who had the upper hand.

We didn't know where we were heading, but suddenly, we saw a steep cliff ahead. We had driven onto a mountain road, and the intense chase had made us oblivious to our surroundings.

Savannah noticed the cliff and broke into a cold sweat, her face tense.

Racing here was dangerous; one wrong move and we'd plunge into the abyss.

The Jeep behind us didn't seem to care and kept ramming into our car.

Savannah gritted her teeth and cursed, "Fuck."

"If I survive today, I'll kill you all."

She sharply turned the steering wheel, expertly navigating the mountain road curves like a professional racer.

But inside the car, we weren't feeling the thrill, just sheer panic.

I gritted my teeth, thinking that once we got out, I'd make Brandon pay for this.

The city was just ahead. Once we got past this mountain road, we'd be in the surveillance zone, and the Jeep wouldn't dare to act recklessly.

I felt a bit relieved, thinking we were almost safe, but then I saw a large truck coming straight at us.

Our road was already winding, and we couldn't avoid a head-on collision with the truck.

The Jeep behind us swerved away, leaving us to face the truck alone.

The truck driver seemed panicked too, trying to steer away, but the long trailer blocked our path. The outcome would be the same whether we hit the trailer or the truck head-on.

I closed my eyes, ready for the worst.

I cursed at God, wondering why Brandon, who did so many bad things, would survive while I had to die. Was it just bad luck?

The front of our car got closer to the truck's trailer, and it felt like a slow-motion countdown to death. I shut my eyes tightly, cursing nonstop.

Savannah gripped the steering wheel, swallowing hard.

Then she made a risky move, sharply turning the wheel to the left, driving us off the cliff.

The car slid down violently. I opened my eyes, realizing something was wrong. I saw Savannah holding the wheel, and in front of us was a steep downhill path. I understood what Savannah had decided.

"Ms. Sharp, if I made the wrong choice, don't blame me!"

I gritted my teeth. "How could I blame you? That was a dead end. This way, we have a chance to survive. Just drive, I won't blame you."

Savannah nodded, and the car sped down the mountain. We hit rocks, tree roots, and trees along the way, spinning inside the car, feeling dizzy.

The car kept crashing, and we were tossed around inside.

Finally, the car hit a huge tree, and the airbags deployed, knocking us both out.

The smell of smoke filled the car, and we gradually lost consciousness.

When I woke up, I saw the hospital room ceiling.

I was startled and quickly called out, "Savannah, Savannah, how is she?"

My last memory was us tumbling down the cliff.

Savannah had protected me, steering right instead of left, exposing her side to the tree.

Royce was sitting by my bed. "Don't worry, she's fine. She hasn't woken up yet, but she only needed six stitches on her head. No other injuries."

I sat up suddenly, seeing Royce by my bed. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. I let out a long breath.

"When did you get back?"

"The day I heard about your accident."

He looked worried, and I thought he was mad at Savannah. I quickly explained, "I supported Savannah's decision to drive off the cliff. If we hadn't, we would have crashed into the truck and died. This way, we had a chance to survive. And look, we both made it."

###chapter 172

Out of nowhere, Royce suddenly pulled me into a tight hug. "Do you have any idea what went through my mind when I heard about your car accident?"

"I was so scared of losing you."

His voice shook, and I couldn't help but feel calmer. I patted his shoulder gently. "Look, I'm fine, aren't I? Savannah saved me. I'm really okay."

He held me for a long time until Simon walked in and cleared his throat. "Alright, you two, that's enough."

Royce finally let go and shot Simon a not-so-friendly glance.

Simon rubbed his nose awkwardly. "Uh, I came to tell you something. Savannah's awake."

I jumped up, but a wave of dizziness hit me. Royce quickly steadied me. "The doctor said you have a mild concussion from the airbag. Take it slow."

I nodded and slowed down.

With Royce's help, I stood up and finally understood how Kathy must have felt.

Royce helped me to the room next door, where Savannah lay in bed with a large bandage on her forehead. She opened her eyes and looked at me, and I stood at the door looking back at her. We locked eyes.

I slowly sat by her bed and took her hand. "From now on, we're bonded for life. Just call me Caroline. Thank you, Savannah."

Savannah's eyes filled with tears, and she gripped my hand tightly. "Got it, Caroline."

Simon tried to lighten the mood. "Alright, alright. Surviving a disaster means good fortune ahead. You three all ended up with concussions at different times. Isn't that fate?"

"There's someone in the other room eagerly waiting for news about you two."

Savannah and I were wheeled by Simon and Royce to Kathy's room.

When she saw us, she opened her mouth but didn't know what to say. "Couldn't you two be more careful? It's bad enough that I'm sick, but now you two are too?"

She started crying, and Savannah and I couldn't help but join in.

My tears were a mix of relief, fear, and the deep bond I felt with Savannah and Kathy.

The three of us hugged and cried together, startling the doctor who came in to check on us.

Eventually, Royce separated us and wheeled us back to our rooms.

I hadn't expected the three of us to end up staying in the hospital like this. I had planned to visit Suncrest City in a couple of days, but now I was stuck here.

I looked at Royce. "Did you find out who that jerk was who raced us? I suspect Brandon sent him. He said before that if I died, he could inherit all my assets. I'm sure that's his plan."

"Don't worry, we're investigating. We won't let him get away."

"We'll make sure you and Savannah get justice. He can't just hit and run."

With Royce's reassurance, I felt relieved and nodded. "Good, I'm counting on you."

Since Savannah and I were admitted later, Kathy's condition was better than ours. She could already walk around, while Savannah and I felt dizzy whenever we got out of bed.

So Royce usually wheeled me around, and Simon helped Kathy walk in the hallway.

Our rooms were next to each other, and one day, Kathy and I saw a man sitting in Savannah's room. He was tall and broad-shouldered, clearly a former soldier.

He was peeling an apple for Savannah, who was blushing and eating it bite by bite.

Kathy and I exchanged a knowing look, full of curiosity. She mouthed to me, "Do you know him?"

I shook my head, then remembered Savannah mentioning her crush.

I whispered back, "Is that the guy she likes?"

Kathy's eyes lit up, and she nodded. "It must be."

"She didn't believe anyone liked her. But look, he came running as soon as he heard she was hurt."

Kathy and I shared a conspiratorial smile.

Our laughter caught Savannah and the man's attention.

They both looked over, and Savannah blushed even more. "Kathy, Caroline, come in. Let me introduce you. This is my former captain, Kirk Gutierrez."

Royce and Simon wheeled us into the room, and we shook hands with Kirk.

"Nice to meet you. We've heard a lot about you. Savannah mentioned you were her drill instructor?"

Kirk's tanned skin looked healthy, clearly from spending a lot of time outdoors training.

He nodded, his voice deep and steady. "Yes, nice to meet you."

"Savannah often talks about you two. She says you treat her like sisters. Thank you for taking care of her."

Kathy and I exchanged a glance, and I smiled mischievously. "No need to thank us. We're her sisters, so it's our duty. But what about you? What's your relationship with Savannah?"

Kirk's face turned red, and he looked at Savannah. They both fell silent.

Kathy and I burst out laughing. We didn't expect them to be so shy.

After the joke, Royce and Simon introduced themselves to Kirk.

I was curious. "How did you know Savannah was sick?"

"A mutual friend from the hospital told me. I happened to be on leave, so I thought I'd drop by."

He emphasized "happened," and I saw a flicker of disappointment on Savannah's face.

I sighed. No wonder their relationship hadn't progressed. They were both so reserved. How could they expect the other to make the first move?

I cleared my throat, deciding to help them out. "Mr. Gutierrez, where do you live? Is it in Skyview City?"

Kirk shook his head. "No, I live in Border Ridge City."

"Wow, that's far. Are you sure you just 'happened' to drop by? It's over a thousand miles from Border Ridge City to Skyview City. You must have been really determined to see Savannah."

"Mr. Gutierrez, if you came specifically to see her, just say so. No need to pretend it was a coincidence."

###chapter 173

Captain Kirk's head drooped lower and lower as we kept teasing him. Finally, Savannah couldn't take it anymore and stepped in to stop us. "Alright, Caroline, Kathy. Mr. Gutierrez spends most of his time training with the troops. He doesn't get this stuff, and you're just confusing him."

I couldn't help but laugh. "You're sticking up for him now?"

The two of them exchanged an embarrassed glance.

Just then, my phone rang. It was a video call from Kelly. I panicked. "Quick, quick, my mom's calling me on video. Everyone, be on alert."

I couldn't let Kelly find out I was in the hospital. She'd drop everything and rush over here.

As I was about to answer, Royce's large hand blocked my neck. "Wait, your neck."

I was taken aback. Royce was always so meticulous, even remembering to cover my neck, which I had forgotten.

I grabbed a scarf and wrapped it around my neck before answering the call.

"Hey, Mom, what's up?"

"I just wanted to check on Kathy. How's she doing? Is she recovering well?"

I glanced at Kathy, who was standing nearby, full of energy. I nodded. "She's doing much better. She'll probably be discharged soon. Let me show you."

I pointed the camera at Kathy, who took the opportunity to do a little dance in front of the lens.

"Thank you for your concern, Mrs. Sharp. I'm feeling much better and will be discharged soon."

"I'll come visit you in Suncrest City then."

Kelly nodded. "I'm a bit tied up here with a few kids to take care of, so I couldn't come see you this time. Sorry, Kathy."

Kathy waved her hand dismissively. "No need to come. It's just a minor issue, and I'm about to be discharged. If you came, I wouldn't know what to do, and my parents might find out too."

Kelly nodded, but then her eyes narrowed. "Caroline, why are you in a wheelchair?"

I was startled. While filming Kathy, I had accidentally shown myself in the wheelchair. Kelly's sharp eyes caught it immediately.

"This, this is Kathy's. She's recovering, but the wheelchair hasn't been taken back yet. I just wanted to try it out since I've never sat in one before."

I quickly stood up, smiling. "See, I'm perfectly fine."

In reality, I felt dizzy as soon as I stood up, and it was only Royce's support that kept me from falling.

"Well, you should get out of it. If the doctor hasn't taken it away, it means she still needs it. You shouldn't be using someone else's wheelchair."

"Got it, Mom. I'll return it right away."

I signaled to Kathy, who cleared her throat and changed her voice. "Kathy, time for rounds."

I immediately said, "Mom, Kathy's got to go for rounds. I'll talk to you later."

"The hospital is too chaotic right now. Once Kathy is discharged, I'll chat with you at home."

Kelly didn't suspect a thing and nodded. "Alright, make sure to return the wheelchair."

I nodded quickly and hung up the call.

After hanging up, I let out a deep breath. Every call with Kelly felt like a covert operation, all to hide my illness.

Thankfully, today's mission was a success.

I sat back down, holding my head. "I'm so dizzy."

We kids who live away from home usually only share good news with our parents to keep them from worrying. Otherwise, what's the point?

Kathy also breathed a sigh of relief. Helping me with this act was a huge psychological burden for her.

"Good thing I'll be discharged in a couple of days. I can't keep up this act. Lying to Mrs. Sharp makes me feel awful."

I rolled my eyes at her. "Didn't I help you lie to your parents? How can you be so ungrateful? You have to see this through with me."

Kathy stuck out her tongue and returned to her room.

I said goodbye to Kirk and Savannah, leaving them some private space.

After all, some things they needed to work out themselves. Even if I confessed for them, it wouldn't help their progress.

Royce wheeled me back to my room and kindly closed the door behind us.

What they talked about, we didn't know.

Back in my room, I wanted to lie down. Royce immediately reached out to help me onto the bed.

I quickly refused. "No, no, I can do it myself. I'm not that fragile."

But Royce didn't listen. He effortlessly picked me up and placed me on the bed, even tucking me in.

My face turned slightly red. He had gotten quite used to doing this during my hospital stay.

I couldn't help but protest. "Royce, you're getting too comfortable carrying me around. Don't you have your own work to do?"

"Of course."

Royce calmly straightened his clothes and looked down at me. "But some things are more urgent. Right now, the most important thing for me is taking care of you."

I bit my lip, feeling my face heat up, unsure how to respond.

I didn't know where he learned to say these things, but he was getting better at it, and with such confidence.

His skin was getting thicker, while mine was getting thinner.

I turned away, pretending not to see him.

I heard him chuckle softly behind me.

Feeling even more embarrassed, I pulled the blanket over my head, planning to sleep.

Sleeping meant I didn't have to face him.

But Royce wasn't just joking. He was quite busy, often on the phone or in video meetings for hours.

I often urged him to go back to work, saying I could hire a nurse.

But he stubbornly stayed, no matter how much I tried to persuade him. Eventually, I gave up. If he wanted to stay, so be it. He was the one working hard, not me.

Lying there, I felt increasingly sleepy.

Since the car accident, I got tired easily. The doctor said it was normal after a concussion and would help with recovery, so I closed my eyes and drifted off, knowing Royce was there to keep me safe.

Maybe I didn't realize it, but Royce's presence was my greatest source of security.

###chapter 174

That night, after I woke up, Joanna came to check on us.

We were all gathered in Kathy's hospital room. Joanna looked at the three of us and said, "This is the first time I've seen people get sick together. You guys are really something."

"Who did this to you two?"

I remembered the terrifying moment on the road and couldn't help but snort. "Who else? That jerk Brandon."

"He said that once I'm dead, all my assets would be his. Looks like he's already making arrangements."

Kathy frowned, clearly furious. "That jerk, he'll get what's coming to him."

"He's so brazen, hitting people in broad daylight?"

Simon explained, "It's not entirely his fault. We've already detained the driver who hit you, and it turns out he has no connection to Brandon. The driver insists he was drunk and accidentally hit you, with no one directing him. We can't link this to Brandon, so the evidence is useless."

"I can't believe it. There's no justice if we can't catch Brandon."

Joanna slammed the table in anger but then smirked. "But don't worry, I've got some good news to cheer you up."

"There's trouble at the company. Irene's in hot water."

I was surprised and looked up at Joanna. "Really? When did this happen? How come I didn't hear about it?"

"Brandon covered it up, so of course, you didn't hear. A few days ago, an audit revealed discrepancies in the accounts Irene handled. They reported it to Brandon."

"Turns out, Irene was secretly transferring company funds to her own account."

"This really pissed Brandon off. The company's already in deep trouble, and now there's embezzlement. He was so mad he beat Irene up. A woman in her forties, crying on the floor, it was quite a scene."

I sneered. "The Jordan family deserves everything they get."

Kathy looked puzzled. "But Irene's an accountant. Doesn't she know it's illegal to transfer company funds to her personal account? How could she dare?"

Joanna and I exchanged a knowing look and laughed. "Remember when I went back to Suncrest City and asked Joanna for a favor?"

"This is the karma from that."

"What favor?" Kathy asked, curious.

"I asked Joanna to introduce Irene to a gambling platform."

"Seeing Joanna play, Irene naturally wanted to try it herself. She had some spare cash, and who doesn't want more money?"

Joanna continued, "I played in front of her, turning a million dollars into two million, and then into five million. Irene was hooked."

"She begged me for the gambling software, but what I gave her was a real gambling app, not the fake one I used."

"These gambling apps assess the user's identity and steal information from other sites. If they determine the person is well-off, they initially offer high returns. Irene fell for it."

"She invested fifty grand and got back a hundred. Then she put in a hundred and got back two hundred. The goal was to lure her into investing everything."

"Step by step, Irene got sucked in. When she finally invested all her savings, she lost everything."

"But gamblers always think they can win it back, so not gambling is harder for them than anything. She had to find money somehow. She didn't dare ask anyone else, so she secretly transferred funds."

"Of course, the amount was beyond her control, so it was only a matter of time before she got caught."

Kathy's eyes widened in amazement. "You guys are ruthless. You took her down without a sound."

I scoffed. "She was brought down by her own greed. If she hadn't gambled, nothing would have happened."

"True."

I was still curious about what happened next. "So what did Brandon do with Irene?"

"Brandon beat her up but didn't dare call the cops. He kept her as the CFO, didn't fire her."

"He still has some old feelings for his aunt."

"But after today, Irene probably won't dare defy Brandon again."

I remembered Brandon saying he would get rid of the Jordan family from the company. It was just a lie to get me to help the company through its current crisis.

"I heard Brandon even used his own money to balance the company's accounts."

"That's our marital property, and he used it for this. Just wait, after the divorce, I'll get every penny back."

They all nodded in agreement.

"Once I'm out of the hospital, I need to go back to the company. I want to see Brandon's desperate face."

Kathy grinned mischievously. "He'll probably be furious."

I stayed in the hospital for a few more days until I recovered.

The doctor said I could go home to rest, and the same went for Savannah.

Kathy had been well for a while, occupying a private room next to ours.

Luckily, the hospital wasn't busy, or she would have been kicked out.

After we were discharged, we decided to celebrate with a meal at a nearby restaurant.

Royce and Simon had to leave for other matters, and with Savannah around, they felt reassured.

Captain Kirk had returned to his unit a few days earlier.

As we sat in the restaurant, we unexpectedly saw a familiar face.

It was Shirley, seemingly buying food.

She turned around with her takeout and saw the three of us.

Our expressions were like we'd seen a fly in our food, but this fly approached us. "Isn't this Caroline? What are you doing here?"

I dipped my utensils in hot water. "Are you blind? Can't you see what I'm doing?"

"You're like a shadow, always lurking around. If you have nothing to say, just leave."

Now that Brandon and I had made our positions clear, I had no reason to be polite to Shirley.

Shirley gritted her teeth and glared at me but quickly composed herself. "Karen is sick, and you're here eating? How can you stomach it?"

###chapter 175

"Why can't she eat? Isn't there someone like you trying to please her?"

I said calmly.

Simon had already told me about the person taking care of Karen in the hospital. To my surprise, it was Shirley.

I never expected Shirley to come back. Seems like Brandon really can't do without her. In every way, Shirley is quite useful.

"You..."

"Aren't you worried people will talk if they find out you didn't visit your seriously ill mother-in-law?"

"What do I have to be afraid of?"

Seeing Shirley's expression, I suddenly laughed. "You probably don't know yet, but Brandon and I are getting a divorce. Soon, you'll have your chance. Karen might even become your mother-in-law. Then, taking care of her will be legit."

"Unlike now, where even if you clean up after her, you're just a nurse."

Hearing about our divorce, Shirley's eyes lit up. "Are you serious? Why didn't Brandon tell me?"

Kathy couldn't help but snort. "He didn't tell you because you're not important. He doesn't think it's necessary to inform you, just a nurse."

"Do you really think you can marry him? Let me tell you, even if you do, it won't matter. After Caroline divorces him, Brandon will leave with nothing. You won't get a dime."

Shirley scoffed. "So what? I truly love Brandon. Even if he has no money, I still love him."

But her greedy eyes betrayed her. I looked at the designer bag she was carrying. Even though it was second-hand, it was still valuable, probably taken from Karen.

And she was flaunting it like a treasure, proving she wasn't someone who valued love over material things. Besides, what kind of feelings could she have for Brandon?

"Alright, then just wait and see."

I glanced at the items in her hand. "You're bringing food to Karen, right? Thanks for the reminder. I'll go visit my dear mother-in-law too."

"After all the good deeds she's done, how could I not go and thank her?"

Shirley's face changed, and she glared at me before turning to leave, not wanting to argue further.

Seeing her reaction, I realized someone didn't want me to visit Karen in the hospital. But Shirley couldn't help herself and came to show off, which backfired.

The more she acted like this, the more I wanted to go.

I turned to Kathy and Savannah. "Want to come with me to Karen's room for some fun?"

Kathy immediately nodded. "Of course."

I looked at Savannah, who also seemed excited.

I couldn't help but sigh. Kathy had corrupted such a good kid like Savannah. She used to have no interest in gossip like this.

Soon, our food arrived. After eating, we planned our visit to Karen.

When it was time to pay, I asked Kathy and Savannah to wait while I went to the market across the street.

When I returned, I was carrying two pounds of walnuts.

They looked at me, puzzled. "What are you doing with those?"

"She had a stroke, right? I'm bringing walnuts to help her brain."

They burst out laughing. "You'll probably make her so mad she'll have another stroke."

I didn't care. My goal was to irritate her.

I knew which hospital Karen was in, so the three of us took a cab there.

After getting out, we headed straight to Karen's department.

Shirley was standing at the door. Seeing us, her face turned sour.

She probably didn't expect us to find the place so quickly.

"What are you doing here? Leave now!"

I chuckled and looked at Savannah, who immediately took out her phone and snapped a few pictures of Shirley's face.

Shirley was startled and quickly covered her face. "What are you doing? Delete those!"

I crossed my arms. "I'm here to see my mother-in-law. Who are you to stop me? You're just a nurse."

"Get out of the way, or I'll post these photos and let everyone know what you've been up to."

Shirley gritted her teeth and glared at me, but she knew I was right. She had no reason to stop me, so she reluctantly stepped aside.

Inside the room, it was dark and had a strange smell.

Kathy immediately covered her nose. "What's that smell? It's awful."

I felt around the wall for the light switch and pointed to the bedpan nearby.

"Karen eats and relieves herself in here. The smell can't escape."

Kathy gagged. "That's disgusting."

I told Savannah, "Savannah, open the window to air out the room."

"Otherwise, how can she stand this smell every day?"

Savannah nodded and went to the window, pulling back the curtains and opening it to let in fresh air.

Seeing this, Shirley panicked. "What are you doing?"

"The doctor said Mrs. Jordan can't be exposed to wind. Close the window now."

"Did the doctor say how to deal with the smell? We need to air it out first. It won't take long."

I had Savannah stand by the window. Anyone who tried to close it got a glare from her.

Shirley knew Savannah's temper, so she didn't dare provoke her and just glared at me.

I sat by the bed and gently pushed Karen's blanket.

She no longer looked like the harsh old woman she used to be. Her face was pale, her body thin and frail.

She looked like she didn't have much time left.

After I pushed her, it took a while for her to open her eyes. When she saw me, her dull eyes immediately focused.

"You... what are you doing here? Get out! Get out!"

But her voice was weak, lacking any authority.

I smiled smugly. "Mom, you're seriously ill, and I haven't visited you. Is there a problem with me coming now? I even brought you a gift."

"You had a stroke, so you need to nourish your brain. I brought two pounds of walnuts."

I handed them to her. "I noticed you don't use your brain much, so these will be perfect. No waste."

###chapter 176

Karen was shaking with rage, barely able to lift a finger to point at me. "You... you get out of here!"

Her speech was slurred from the brain damage, and drool dribbled from her mouth.

Watching her try to curse me with that face was almost funny, not threatening at all.

Realizing how undignified she looked, she started to howl.

"Get out!"

I didn't budge, just sat there looking at her. "You've had a rough life, Karen. You worked hard raising your kids, and now, when you should be enjoying your old age, you get this illness."

"I came to see you out of kindness because I think you don't have much time left."

"After all these years of you making our lives miserable, why shouldn't I be angry at you?"

"Karen, you're almost gone. Try to be a little kinder."

Something I said must have hit a nerve because Karen closed her eyes and went silent.

"Oh, by the way, Jason hasn't been buried yet. He's still in the police station's cold storage."

"Poor Jason, I wonder if he's cold."

Karen's eyes snapped open at that.

She looked at me, and instead of the previous anger, there was a deep sadness in her eyes.

She must have truly loved Jason; otherwise, she wouldn't have gotten so sick over him.

But to me, it was all the more ironic. All her love went to an illegitimate child, while my son Brett only felt inferior and oppressed in front of her.

So even if I felt sorry for Jason, I didn't pity Karen's feelings for him. I just found it ironic.

She closed her eyes again, and a tear fell.

"Jason, I'm sorry I couldn't see your killer brought to justice."

I watched her without saying a word.

Karen grew more and more upset and eventually started crying.

Shirley glared at me. "What did you say to her? Get out! Don't you know she's sick? Why are you making her so emotional?"

I couldn't help but laugh coldly. "What does it have to do with me? She's crying on her own. Did I slap her to make her cry?"

"Besides, you should comfort her. Weren't you the one who took Jason away?"

"So if it weren't for you, Jason wouldn't be dead."

A flash of guilt crossed Shirley's face as she quickly glanced at Karen, who was too absorbed in her emotions to hear our conversation.

"You're talking nonsense. Jason's death has nothing to do with me."

"Why are you so defensive? I didn't say you killed him. I just said it was related to you."

"What if I told her about it..."

Shirley glared at me fiercely. "Don't even think about it. Get out."

I bent down and whispered two sentences into Karen's ear. She immediately tried to get up but was stopped by Savannah.

"What did you say to her? I told you not to say anything to her!"

"What does it have to do with you? Mind your own business."

I rolled my eyes and got up to leave.

Shirley, afraid we wouldn't leave, hurried us down the hallway. "Get out and don't come back. Mrs. Jordan doesn't want to see you."

Kathy rolled her eyes. "This place reeks. We don't want to come back anyway."

I turned to Shirley. "But I gotta hand it to you. Out of all Brandon's mistresses, you're the one stuck taking care of his mom."

"He has you cleaning up after his mom. Guess that's all you're good for in Brandon's eyes."

"Why doesn't he have Maeve do it?"

That hit a nerve with Shirley.

"So what? It means Brandon still cares about me. He treats me like family."

Family, huh?

"You're delusional. If you want to do it, go ahead. Let's see what you get out of it in the end."

"If I tell you that every penny Brandon spends on you is our marital property, and I'll sue you to get it back after we divorce, are you ready to pay up?"

Shirley's face twisted, and she glared at me. "Why? Brandon gave it to me!"

"Isn't it our joint money? Do you think Brandon, the broke guy he used to be, would have money to give you?"

As we argued in the hallway, a voice came from behind us. "What's going on here?"

I turned to see Brandon, the man I hadn't seen in a while.

The injuries on his face had mostly healed, with no trace of the beating Savannah gave him.

Shirley immediately ran to Brandon's side, clinging to his arm. "Brandon."

Her voice was pitiful.

I laughed coldly, crossing my arms as I watched them.

Brandon glared at Shirley. "I told you to take care of my mom. Why are you arguing with her?"

Shirley stomped her foot in frustration. "She started it."

"And she made Mrs. Jordan cry."

Hearing this, Brandon's sharp eyes turned to me. "Caroline, she's still your mom. Was that necessary?"

"Can you let Shirley finish her sentence? I made her cry?"

"She cried because she thought of Jason. How could I control that?"

Hearing this, Brandon's expression softened a bit, and he glared at Shirley. "Get back in there and take care of my mom. What are you doing out here? Get lost!"

Shirley shot me a look before going back into the room.

Brandon looked at me eagerly. "Honey, does this mean..."

I frowned at his behavior, not understanding why he was acting like this after trying to run me over with a car.

"You're overthinking it. We're definitely getting divorced. I came to see her because we were once family. If I don't come, you'll use it against me, so I made the trip to avoid trouble."

"Who knows what you'll say about me in the future? That I'm an ungrateful daughter-in-law who doesn't care about family."

Brandon's face changed, but he still said, "Honey, I was just angry that day. I really care about you. Can we not get divorced?"

"I'll listen to you in everything, both in life and at work. No more arguments."

"Give me another chance. Every man makes mistakes. Are you really going to end it because of that one incident?"

"Besides, you hit me that day too. We're even. Let's move past it, okay? Honey? I miss you."

###chapter 177

I looked at him and felt a wave of nausea.

"Let's talk in a few days."

"I'll see how you behave."

These two sentences were just to brush Brandon off, so he wouldn't keep an eye on me and prevent me from making any big moves.

Sure enough, Brandon's eyes lit up, thinking I had softened again. He quickly nodded.

"Alright, babe, I'll wait for you. In a few days, let's sit down and clear up all the misunderstandings, and then we can be like we used to, okay?"

I rolled my eyes. "We'll see."

The three of us turned and left, and as soon as we were out of the hospital, we couldn't help but make gagging faces.

"He really knows how to put on a show. He probably hates you to death right now, but on the surface, he still acts like this. It's terrifying."

I nodded. "I've realized that while Brandon is a loser, he's pretty good at acting. If he hadn't become a fitness trainer and had gone into acting, he might have had a decent career."

"Forget it. Letting someone like him become a public figure? He'd be a bad influence on kids."

Kathy couldn't help but say.

I nodded. "You're right. It'd be better if Brandon just disappeared. As long as he's alive, he's a danger to others."

Kathy and Savannah both nodded in agreement. "I agree."

After getting in the car, I had Savannah drop Kathy off at home first.

Ever since what happened last time, we couldn't let Kathy face things alone anymore.

On the way back, I said to Savannah, "We should find a more stable place to stay. Staying in hotels every day is inconvenient with so many people around. Can you look for a place nearby that's private and secure? Money isn't an issue; safety is the most important thing."

Savannah nodded. "Don't worry, Caroline. I'll start looking as soon as we get back."

With her handling it, I felt at ease. When we got back to the hotel, I suddenly received a call from Royce.

"Asher's flight lands in Skyview City at 8 PM tonight."

My eyes lit up. "He's really coming back?"

Asher had been forced to leave this city in disgrace because of those villains. I was afraid he might have a shadow over this place.

"Yes, do you want to go welcome him?"

I nodded. "Of course, I'll go. How could I not? Wait for me!"

Royce said quietly, "You didn't react like this when I came back."

I felt a bit helpless. "I was unconscious when you came back. What kind of reaction did you expect? Sleep-talking?"

Royce chuckled. "Got it. I'll send you the address later."

Knowing Asher was coming back made me feel light and happy. After all, I knew I had another strong supporter.

Thinking about the welcome dinner tonight, I was too excited to sleep. Meanwhile, Savannah quickly found several neighborhoods that met my requirements.

I decided not to rest and to go see them right away since I was so excited.

Savannah was a bit surprised and tried to persuade me to rest a bit, but I shook my head.

"No, let's strike while the iron is hot and get the house."

Seeing me so determined, Savannah didn't try to persuade me further and took me to see the properties.

I had to admit, the places Savannah took me to really met my requirements for privacy and security.

The security guards at the entrance of the neighborhood each had a big dog, ready to pounce at any moment.

It was like they were always ready to catch bad guys.

Even more interestingly, when the agent showed us the house, the dogs didn't approach us but just sniffed around, as if they could tell who was good and who was bad.

The agent showed us a house we had liked from the pictures.

I didn't have many demands for the house's decor; my main requirement was that it be big enough. After all, I had three kids, and each would need their own room in the future.

Even though I might not settle in Skyview City permanently, I would still come back occasionally, so I needed a house ready.

Also, there would be people like Savannah and Kathy who liked to stay at my place, so I needed to have a room for them too.

So when I saw the five-bedroom, two-living room, two-kitchen, and two-bathroom layout, I immediately liked it.

The house was also located in the deepest part of the neighborhood, and you had to take a shuttle to get there.

I was instantly satisfied and signed the contract on the spot.

The agent kept praising my decisiveness, saying it had been a long time since they had seen someone as straightforward as me.

I didn't respond. When I was married to Brandon, I was reluctant to spend money.

Looking back, it was probably due to the subtle influence of the Jordan family, telling me that a wife should save money and such.

And I actually listened to them back then, becoming a puppet they controlled.

But the money was mine. Why couldn't I spend it? Saving it only resulted in Brandon giving it all to his mistress.

After buying the house, I felt relieved. Once the transfer was done, Savannah moved our things from the hotel to the new house, and I finally felt a sense of security.

After all, I was sure Brandon would never find this place because he was terrified of dogs.

He'd probably be scared out of his wits just standing at the entrance.

In the evening, I dressed up and went to the private room where Asher and Royce were having dinner.

They were already seated inside.

I went in and hugged Asher. "Asher, welcome back."

This hug was significant for both of us. It meant Asher had completely left his painful past behind and found himself again.

He hugged me tightly and patted my shoulder. "I'm back to help you, Caroline."

I was instantly moved to tears.

We hugged for a long time until Royce coughed. "That's enough."

Asher finally let go and laughed heartily. "Look at Royce, not even letting me hug you a bit longer. Why can't I hug you?"

I turned and glared at Royce. "Don't talk nonsense. What does it have to do with him?"

Asher laughed. "If I hugged you any longer, Royce's eyes would probably kill me. I don't dare."

I cleared my throat and sat down, a bit embarrassed. "Asher, why did you come back so suddenly? You didn't give me a heads-up."

"I was really excited to know you were coming back. It felt like when we first started at the company."

"Even though it feels like ten years have passed, it also feels like nothing has changed."

Asher nodded with emotion. "Indeed, as soon as I got off the plane today, I felt the same excitement and thrill as when we first started the business."

"So I told Royce, I might as well come back early to help you."

###chapter 178

I nodded right away. "Asher, you have no idea. We're seriously short-staffed right now."

I caught Asher up on everything that had gone down recently.

Asher slammed his hand on the table, fuming. "That jerk Brandon, he's unreal."

"Why didn't you tell me about the car accident, Caroline?"

"I didn't want you to worry. I'm fine now."

"As long as you're okay, we can focus on dealing with Brandon."

He nodded. "Don't worry. While I was at home, I kept an eye on the company's stock prices. On the way here, Royce filled me in on what's been happening. I have a pretty good grasp of the situation."

"That's great. We can take action right away."

Asher nodded.

I said, "Let's not talk about that now. Asher, where are you staying?"

He replied, "I'm at a hotel for now. I haven't found a place yet. I definitely can't go back to my old rental. Who knows if Brandon has someone watching it? I need to find a new place."

I quickly said, "No, Asher, stay at my place. I'm divorcing Brandon, so I moved out. My place has five bedrooms. You can stay there, and it'll be easier for us to discuss things."

"Well..."

Asher glanced at Royce.

I stepped in front of him, blocking his view. "Why are you looking at him? Just stay at my place. It's safer."

To my surprise, Royce suddenly said, "No need. I've already found a place for Asher."

I was taken aback. "When did you do that?"

"Trust me, staying somewhere else is inconvenient. I have plenty of empty rooms. What's the big deal?"

I tried to persuade them, but Asher wouldn't budge.

"No, Caroline. I'll stay at Royce's. It's not inconvenient. We can talk over the phone if we need to."

When Royce stepped out to take a call, Asher said to me, "Caroline, why are you so insistent on me staying at your place?"

"Didn't you see the way Royce looked at me? If I stay at your place tonight, our relationship will be over by tomorrow."

"Really?"

Asher chuckled softly. "Watch this. I'll tell him I'm staying at your place and not his. Just watch his reaction."

When Royce returned, Asher cleared his throat. "Royce, I'm not staying at your place tonight. Caroline has a spare room, and we need to talk. We'll figure things out tomorrow."

Royce's eyes narrowed. "That's not a good idea. Her place is full of girls. It wouldn't look right for you to stay there. Stay at my place. We can talk during the day."

Asher glanced at Royce and then winked at me. "See what I mean?"

Royce looked puzzled, glancing between us.

I felt a bit embarrassed and gave Royce a light glare.

Just then, my phone rang. It was Francis, who Simon had placed in the company.

"Ms. Sharp? This is Francis."

"I used to report to Simon, but he said I should speak to you directly about this."

I nodded, sensing the urgency. I put the call on speaker so Asher and Royce could hear. They were both trustworthy.

"Go ahead."

"Irene embezzled two million dollars last time, which Brandon covered. But today, I discovered she secretly took another ten million."

"So far, Brandon doesn't know."

I couldn't help but laugh coldly. "No wonder they say gamblers never change. Irene must be out of her mind."

"If she were always honest, we wouldn't have a chance. Since she's given us this opportunity, we should take it."

"Find a way to pin the ten million on Brandon and inform the shareholders."

"Make it clear that with Brandon in charge, the company is doomed. Let's see if they sell their shares."

Francis agreed. "Got it. I'll need Simon's help."

"Okay, you two handle it. We'll take care of the aftermath."

After hanging up, I looked at Royce and Asher. "This is a great opportunity."

Royce nodded. "Yeah, a lot of shareholders will probably sell their shares. We can buy them up."

"Asher, I remember some of the shareholders are your friends. Maybe you can convince them not to sell."

"That way, when the company is back in your hands, there won't be any misunderstandings. Explain the situation to them."

Asher nodded. "You're right. I'll call them now."

He started contacting his old friends, explaining the situation to each one.

When Asher and I started the company, we relied on the investments from his friends and our hard work to stabilize it. Losing other shareholders didn't matter as long as these key people stayed. They were the company's backbone.

After he finished his calls, I breathed a sigh of relief.

To me, the matter seemed settled.

Just then, I received an unexpected call from my seriously ill mother-in-law, Karen.

Asher, Royce, and I exchanged glances. They knew the situation. Karen was gravely ill. Why would she call me now? Was someone else using her phone?

I answered, full of suspicion. A weak, raspy voice came through. It was Karen.

"Caroline, I'm not going to make it."

I listened as she continued. "Jason is my favorite child. I don't care if you're angry. As a dying woman, I ask you to bury me with Jason after I die."

"So I can look after him. The Jordan family won't care about Jason."

"There's a bank card in my room. The password is in the vanity drawer. It's for our burial expenses."

She spoke haltingly, each sentence taking great effort. When she finished, she took a deep breath.

"Thank you," she said with difficulty before hanging up.

The three of us exchanged glances. "Is this real? Could it be a trick?" Asher asked, puzzled.

###chapter 179

I nodded. "Yeah, it could be a setup, but knowing Karen, she might just want me to take care of Jason. She knows the Jordan family won't deal with his body."

"Probably figured I'd be the only one willing, so she called me," I added.

Royce nodded. "Whatever the case, let's go check it out. I'll go with you."

Asher wanted to come too, but I stopped him. "Asher, you should get settled in first. There'll be plenty of chances for you to help out later. Royce and I can handle this."

He reluctantly agreed. "Alright, but be careful."

Royce and I left and drove to Karen's gated community. The houses he and Elora used to live in were now empty, with overgrown lawns.

It was clear that without residents, the place had fallen into disrepair.

I knew the code to Karen's house because I had occasionally dropped Brett off there. It came in handy now.

I punched in the code and opened the door. The house was empty, with a strange, musty smell.

Royce told me to stay put while he quickly checked the house. He came back and shook his head. "No one's here."

I nodded and went inside. Following Karen's instructions, I found a bank card and a note with the PIN on her vanity.

She really did leave it for me. I turned to Royce. "Let's go to the bank and see how much is in here."

We drove to the nearest ATM. I inserted the card and entered the PIN.

The balance displayed on the screen made me freeze. Five million dollars.

"This must be Karen's life savings. Why would she leave it all to me?"

"And it's way more than needed for Jason's burial and her own."

I was increasingly puzzled. Why had Karen suddenly changed before her death? I never believed in the idea that people become good when they're about to die. A bad person remains bad until the end. But this situation was confusing.

Royce suggested, "Maybe she thought you and Brandon hadn't divorced yet, and by giving you the money, she was also giving it to Brandon."

I realized he might be right. "That makes sense. Karen probably thought that way."

"Well, in that case, I won't let this money go to waste." I transferred the money to my own account and discarded the card.

Royce dropped me off at home, and I told Savannah what had happened. She was just as shocked.

"Karen really surprised us. Who would have thought she'd do something good before she died?"

"Yeah, who would have thought?"

"Life is so unpredictable. Who would have imagined that Karen, who was so full of life a year ago, would die so soon?"

"And Elora, who was at the peak of her life, and little Jason, are both gone too."

Life is truly unpredictable.

I felt this deeply now and couldn't help but sigh.

After a simple dinner with Savannah, we went to bed early. I had a feeling the next few days would be busy, so I wanted to rest up.

The next morning, I got an unexpected call from Irene.

"Caroline, did you take something from Karen?" she demanded.

I frowned. "What does it matter to you? She was my mother-in-law. Why wouldn't I take something?"

"That's crap. She was my sister-in-law."

"I just want to know if you took something. Return it immediately."

"I can't. I threw it away."

"You... There's no way you threw away that much money."

"You're stealing Karen's money. Return it, or I'll call the police."

I rolled my eyes. "Karen left me that money before she died. I have a recording of her call. If you think I'm lying, go ahead and call the police. See if I don't have proof."

"Just you wait, Caroline."

She hung up, seething.

That afternoon, I got news from the hospital that Karen had died.

I was stunned. Remembering Irene's call that morning, I was sure her sudden death had something to do with Irene. They must have caused a scene at the hospital.

I called Francis. "Do you have surveillance footage from the hospital? Any video of Karen's death?"

He quickly responded, "Yes, I'll get it for you."

Soon, Francis sent me a video from the dimly lit hospital room.

Savannah and I watched nervously from the couch.

The dark room, with a single person lying on a white bed, felt like the start of a ghost story.

After a while, someone entered the room. It was Irene. The timestamp showed it was before she called me that morning.

She sat next to Karen and asked, "Karen, didn't you save any money over the years?"

Karen, seemingly in a daze, replied, "Yes, I saved some."

Even through the screen, I could see Irene's eyes light up. She quickly asked, "Where's the money?"

"I gave it to Caroline."

"To help bury me and Jason together."

Irene pressed on. "You must have more money than that."

"The rest is for my three grandkids' education. I owe them, so I left some money for them."

I finally understood why Karen had left me such a large sum. It was for the kids. She did something good before she died, not completely favoring Jason.

She must have realized that Jason was gone, and my three kids were the true heirs of the Jordan family.

But her plan would fail. Once I divorced Brandon, I would change my kids' last names, severing any ties with the Jordan family.

"Why give it to them? Their mom is rich. They don't need your money. Give it to me, Karen."

Thankfully, Karen still had some clarity. "No, I can't."

###chapter 180

Irene shot Karen a venomous look, stood up, and pulled out her phone to call me.

The conversation that followed was identical to the one I had with her earlier that morning.

After hanging up, Shirley walked in and was taken aback to see Irene. "Aunt Irene, what are you doing here?"

Irene, stressed out from trying to gather money, glared at Shirley. "Who are you calling 'Aunt'? You're just a lousy maid."

"I'm Brandon's aunt, Caroline's aunt. What does that have to do with you? What right do you have to call me 'Aunt'?"

Shirley was stunned, her face darkening. "You can't say that. What if Caroline and Brandon get divorced?"

"Even then, it wouldn't be your turn. What makes you think you can marry Brandon? Get out."

"Don't think I don't know you stole money from the company and had Brandon cover for you."

"What right do you have to be here now?"

Shirley hit a nerve, making Irene furious. She slapped Shirley hard.

"Shut up!"

Shirley sneered. "Feeling guilty now? Why didn't you think of that when you took the money?"

"Don't think I don't know your story. You were just an ordinary accountant. If it weren't for Brandon, you wouldn't be the CFO. Do you really think you have the ability?"

The argument escalated, and soon they were physically fighting in the hospital room.

Slaps, hair-pulling, and kicks ensued, creating quite a scene.

Karen, lying in the hospital bed, remained unresponsive, as if she didn't see anything.

Irene, being older, couldn't keep up with the younger Shirley and was soon pushed to the ground.

Shirley walked over to Karen, gloating. "Mrs. Jordan, did you see that? Irene is just a fraud, only good at stealing Brandon's money."

Unexpectedly, Karen, who had been motionless, suddenly sat up and grabbed Shirley.

None of us saw it coming.

Karen bit down on Shirley's ear with precision and force. No matter how much Shirley struggled, Karen didn't let go. Shirley's screams echoed through the room and the video, sending chills down our spines.

Finally, Shirley couldn't take it anymore and kicked Karen, who fell back onto the bed, spitting out a piece of Shirley's ear.

Karen, her mouth bloody, glared at Shirley. "You bitch, you killed Jason."

Shirley, clutching her ear, screamed and ran out of the room, leaving it in silence.

Irene got up, not even glancing at the barely breathing Karen, and walked out.

That bite must have drained all of Karen's strength. Coupled with Shirley's kick, she was at death's door.

But her willpower was strong; she held on until the afternoon before passing away.

Seeing this, Savannah and I couldn't help but sigh.

"Karen was ruthless. She used all her remaining strength on Shirley," Savannah remarked.

I chuckled. "Shirley had it coming. Jason's death was orchestrated by Earl and her."

Savannah nodded, then asked curiously, "How did Karen know Shirley was behind Jason's death?"

I smiled mysteriously. "I told her. I couldn't let Karen die without knowing the truth, could I?"

"Karen must have been dwelling on this for days."

"And now it finally exploded."

Savannah nodded. "Good. At least she did something right before she died."

Suddenly realizing something, I quickly called Simon.

"Simon, can you set up a press conference for me within half an hour? I have something important."

Simon was surprised but quickly agreed. "Alright, I'll get back to you."

Then I called Royce. "I'm planning to hold the press conference early, before the Jordan family can react."

Royce's reassuring voice came through. "I understand. Go ahead."

With his support, I felt relieved. Simon worked fast, securing a venue in less than half an hour.

I hurried over with Savannah, deliberately not wearing makeup to show my true, haggard appearance.

The reporters were already seated, whispering about the sudden press conference.

I stepped onto the stage and bowed. "Hello, everyone. I'm here to address the recent rumors about our company and our CEO, Brandon."

"Additionally, I want to announce that I am officially divorcing Mr. Jordan."

As I sat down, the cameras flashed incessantly.

I remained still, letting them take their photos.

"Ms. Sharp, how will you divide the assets after the divorce?"

"I understand you founded the company. Are you really willing to give Mr. Jordan half?"

I adjusted my glasses and softly said, "That depends on Mr. Jordan. Since my pregnancy, the company hasn't been in my hands. The upper management is all from the Jordan family."

The murmurs grew louder. I intentionally left it vague, making them think Brandon married me to take over my family's company.

After all, Brandon's past had been thoroughly dug up online. His family wasn't wealthy; in fact, they were quite poor. Marrying into my family was their fortune.

"Can you tell us why you're divorcing Mr. Jordan?"

I froze, slowly shaking my head.

But I made sure my face was clearly visible to the cameras, showing a tear rolling down my cheek. "I'm sorry, I can't answer that."

Savannah, standing behind me, handed me a tissue at the right moment. I pretended to wipe my tears, looking very sorrowful.

This only fueled the media frenzy.

After the press conference, Savannah and I stepped off the stage. I rubbed my eyes; the eye drops had really stung.

But they had done the trick, bringing out real tears.

###chapter 181

I looked at Savannah with excitement. "How was my acting just now?"

She gave me a big thumbs up, her eyes sparkling. "Absolutely flawless!"

Just then, Kathy called. She knew about my press conference and had been following it from home.

"Caroline, your performance was incredible! For a moment, I almost believed you were some poor woman who got swindled by a broke guy who then cheated on you and left you after he got rich."

I chuckled softly. "Isn't that exactly what happened? That's the truth."

Kathy paused, then nodded. "Right, right, I almost forgot. So, were those real emotions?"

I scoffed. "Of course not. It was all an act. I stopped caring about Brandon a long time ago. The only difference between the story I told and reality is that I saw through him ages ago."

"I had to play the part of a woman who just found out the truth and was heartbroken into a divorce. That way, the public would fully support me."

"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant."

"By the end of today's press conference, the entire city's media and public opinion will be on your side."

"And the most important thing is, the company still has a ten-million-dollar gap they can't fill. It won't be long before it collapses completely."

"And our plan will be a success."

Savannah and I went home, waiting for the public reaction to unfold.

As things escalated, everyone was condemning Brandon, but there was still no news about Karen's death. It seemed Brandon was deliberately keeping it under wraps.

So, I called Simon.

"Can you spread a rumor that Brandon's lover and his aunt kicked Karen to death in the hospital?"

"People love conspiracy theories about rich families. This will attract even more attention, especially from those who weren't following the story."

Simon agreed. "By the way, Francis told me today that Brandon's company can't cover Irene's ten-million-dollar gap, and suppliers are pulling out. The collapse is imminent."

I nodded. "Good. I want Brandon to lose everything."

After hanging up, I let out a deep breath.

Things were resolving nicely, which made me happy.

The only unexpected part was Karen's sudden death, and we hadn't caught Earl.

But that was okay. Earl would definitely show up at Karen's funeral.

Just then, I got a call from Leo.

He sounded hesitant. "Caroline, did you hear about Karen's death?"

"Really? I had no idea."

I played dumb. "I saw some rumors online saying Irene and the others killed Karen, but I didn't believe it. Is it true?"

As the mastermind, I pretended to know nothing, which made Leo hesitate. "It seems Karen really is dead, but I haven't been to the hospital. I just heard about it."

"By the way, I'm planning to visit the hospital later. Do you want to come with me?"

I sensed something was off and asked, "Leo, how did you know I was back in Skyview City?"

He realized he slipped up and reluctantly said, "I saw your press conference."

"So, you and Brandon are really getting divorced? There's no chance of reconciliation?"

It seemed Leo wasn't simple either. He was probably here to test my attitude.

"No chance. He hit me last time, and that's something I can't tolerate. Divorce is the only option."

Leo sighed. "Alright, don't overthink it. If you need any help, just let me know."

I nodded. "Thanks."

"And about Briar..."

He probably realized that since we were divorcing, it wasn't appropriate for Briar to stay with me.

"Don't worry, Leo. Briar can stay with my mom until school starts. She's having fun with my kids, so there's no need to worry."

"Even if we're not a family anymore, the kids don't understand that. They're still friends."

Leo nodded and sincerely thanked me before hanging up.

Meanwhile, Brandon's call came through.

After the press conference, Brandon had called me many times, but I blocked him. Now he was using another number.

I glanced at it and decided to hear what he had to say, so I answered.

On the other end, Brandon was shouting hysterically. "Caroline, do you have to be so ruthless?"

"Are you setting me up?"

I laughed lightly. "Setting you up? I just told the truth at the press conference. Haven't we reached this point? Did I say anything wrong?"

"Why did you have to do it when my mom just died?"

"How was I supposed to know? Leo just told me. How was I supposed to know your mom died?"

"Or do you think her death has something to do with me?"

"Besides, when I visited her, she still had the energy to curse at me. How did she die so suddenly? Maybe you should question the people taking care of her instead of blaming me."

"Did you say something to my mom?"

I rolled my eyes. "Why don't you ask her yourself?"

"By the way, I saw online that Shirley and Irene killed your mom. Is that true?"

"After all, we were in-laws for a while. You should tell me."

Brandon was silent on the other end.

I couldn't help but laugh. "Shirley must be your true love."

"Even now, you're still protecting her."

"She killed your son and now your mom. Are they both less important than Shirley? Let's just divorce so you can be with her."

"Caroline, can't we talk about this later?"

"Why should I? Why should I put up with your ten years of cheating? Don't think I don't know. In our ten years of marriage, did you ever stop?"

###chapter 182

Brandon knew he was in the wrong, so he gritted his teeth and stayed silent.

"Don't push him to the edge, Caroline."

With that, he hung up the phone.

I let out a cold laugh, not caring at all.

That evening, Simon and Francis brought me the latest intel.

"Brandon's stuck in his office. Shareholders and employees who haven't been paid for a month are all over him."

"They're demanding answers. The company mysteriously lost ten million dollars, and everyone's blaming Brandon. He's been trying to borrow money all day, but no one's willing to help. He's completely cornered."

"His only way out now is to sign the equity agreement."

I couldn't help but chuckle. "Keep pushing him. Let's see what he does then."

"But that ten million dollars is still on Brandon. If you divorce him, won't you also be saddled with that debt?"

I had no intention of paying a dime to the Jordan family. After a moment of thought, I said, "I'll call Mr. Franklin. Wait for me."

After hanging up on Simon, I called Travis, who picked up quickly.

"Mr. Franklin, here's the situation..."

I explained everything to Travis, and he nodded. "I've heard about it. If you divorce now, you'll likely be burdened with the debt. But there are ways to handle it legally."

I suddenly understood and thanked him repeatedly. "Thank you, Mr. Franklin. Could you draft a divorce agreement for me? I want Brandon to leave with nothing and give up custody of the kids."

He nodded. "Sure."

After hanging up, I asked Savannah, "Did we sell the house Brandon and I used to live in?"

Savannah shook her head. "Not yet. The market's bad right now, so it's still listed."

I nodded. "Let's go back."

Savannah and I returned to the house I'd lived in for nearly ten years.

Brandon probably hadn't been back in a long time. The place felt desolate, nothing like it used to.

Savannah looked puzzled. "Caroline, why are we here?"

"We're waiting for Brandon. He'll have no choice but to sign the equity agreement. When he's penniless, he'll come back here."

Savannah nodded, somewhat understanding. She always followed my lead without question, staying with me.

That night, Francis called. "Ms. Sharp, he signed it."

I was thrilled and thanked him. "You've worked hard. I'll have Simon give you a bonus. Take a good rest."

He thanked me and hung up.

Sure enough, Brandon came back that night, looking nothing like his former confident self.

His white shirt was disheveled, and his tie was nearly torn apart. He held his suit jacket in his hand, his eyes red from sleepless nights, hair a mess.

Seeing me, he rasped, "Are you satisfied now?"

There was no more anger in his voice.

I chuckled. "Satisfied? I lost the company I built with my own hands."

"Then why didn't you give me the money before? Why?"

"If you had turned your dad's shares into cash for me, maybe things would be different now. Why did you do this to me?"

He wasn't angry, just defeated.

I sneered. "Brandon, do you really not know the real reason?"

"Tell me, in these ten years of marriage, how much genuine care did you show me? How did you treat me?"

"From the moment we got married, you kept cheating. Even after I had our child, you drugged me, trying to take over my company."

"Wasn't Eugene, the guy around my mom, sent by you? He's Elora's uncle, right?"

"In your plan, I should've been dead months ago. But when you heard about the urban renewal project, you decided to keep me alive. Isn't all of this your doing?"

"Everything you did was to get the Sharp family's money. So why shouldn't I do this to you? I think I haven't been harsh enough."

"Compared to what you did, my actions are nothing. Brandon, you deserve this!"

Brandon sat on the couch, silently listening.

He rubbed his face. "So you knew all along. You've been pretending this whole time?"

"Yes, every interaction with you made me sick."

"If it weren't for today, I wouldn't have tolerated it."

"I suspected something was off back then. I was right."

I sneered but said nothing.

He continued, "All these years, you never respected me, did you?"

"When I pursued you, you didn't respect me. You only married me because I treated you well, like a servant."

"In your family, I had no status. Every holiday, I felt inferior. Why?"

"Didn't I try hard enough? Didn't I work hard enough?"

I couldn't help but laugh. "Brandon, I never looked down on you. You looked down on yourself."

"If I really thought that way, I wouldn't have married you. There are plenty of good men in Skyview City."

"Even when I found out you cheated, I thought I could forgive you for the kids. But you tried to kill me, and you involved my mom. I can never forgive you."

"You brought this on yourself."

He stayed silent for a moment.

I took out the divorce papers and placed them on the table, both already signed by me.

"Let's divorce. You know we can never be together again."

To my surprise, Brandon suddenly laughed maniacally and tore the papers to shreds.

"Dream on. I'll never divorce you. We're stuck together for life."

"Caroline, you'll always be my wife."

"So what if the company is gone? As long as I stick with you, half of the urban renewal money is mine, half of your shares are mine. You'll always have to give me half."

"And I'll never divorce you."

###chapter 183

I watched him, nearly driven mad, and gave a calm smile.

I knew Brandon wouldn't easily sign the divorce papers and give up custody, so I had prepared my own methods.

"Are you really not gonna sign?"

I pulled out my phone, ready to dial 911.

"If you don't sign, I'm calling the cops. You know what you've done. You're not clean. Do you really want the police digging into your business?"

"Whether you divorce me now or I sue you for divorce while you're in jail, the result is the same. Because you're the father of our three kids, I don't want you to have a criminal record that would trouble them in the future. So I'm giving you this chance. I'll ask you one more time: will you sign or not?"

Brandon gritted his teeth. "Caroline, don't push me. If you push me too far, we'll both go down together."

"I'm broke anyway. Going down with you would be worth it."

I chuckled. "Do you think you're worth it?"

He flew into a rage and lunged at me.

Just then, Savannah came out and kicked Brandon in the chest, knocking him to the ground.

This time, she used all her strength. Brandon lay on the floor, clutching his chest and gasping for breath.

"Caroline, I won't let you get away with this."

"You think your word alone can get me arrested? Think again. There's no evidence. I've erased everything."

I sneered. "Evidence? Do you think I'm an idiot?"

I glanced at Savannah, signaling her to take out her phone.

Savannah held up the phone in front of Brandon, showing him all the evidence of his wrongdoings against me, including the recent transaction records between him and the driver who tried to kill me and Savannah.

"You thought using someone else to transfer the money would hide your tracks? Brandon, I have ways to trace you. That driver is proof you hired someone to kill me and Savannah. With this evidence, you'll never escape. Get ready to rot in jail."

I had to thank Simon for finding the evidence tonight and sending it to me. Without it, I wouldn't have had this leverage over Brandon.

Brandon's face turned ashen as he looked at the evidence, unable to believe I had kept it all.

"How did you know?"

"Someone's helping you, right? Who's helping you?"

I chuckled. "You're right this time. I have plenty of people helping me."

"I'll ask you one last time: divorce or jail? Your choice."

He gritted his teeth, staring at the photos for a long time.

"I'll sign."

"Caroline, you're ruthless. You'll get your comeuppance one day. Just wait."

I chuckled. "Only bad people get punished by God. My fate has nothing to do with you."

"You should worry about how to pay back that million dollars."

He didn't say another word. I had Savannah bring out another set of divorce papers.

I had anticipated he would tear them up, so I prepared several copies. I wouldn't let anything delay my divorce from Brandon.

He took the pen, squatted down, and signed the papers on the coffee table.

The moment he finished signing, I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders.

He glared at me after signing.

"Caroline, just you wait."

I chuckled. "Goodbye and good riddance. This isn't your home anymore."

I handed a copy of the divorce papers to Savannah, afraid Brandon might change his mind.

He gritted his teeth. "Don't forget, this is my home too."

"I'm in a hurry to get rid of you. Even one more second of seeing you makes me sick. What if you stay the night and refuse to leave? Get out, now."

"Savannah, help Mr. Jordan pack his things."

Savannah nodded and stood in front of Brandon. "Let's go, Mr. Jordan. Or do you need my help?"

He glared at us and went upstairs to pack.

In no time, he had all his belongings in a bag and was ushered out by Savannah.

"You'll regret this. You'll get what's coming to you, Caroline."

With that, he left the house with his bag.

I watched his back and scoffed. "We'll see who gets their comeuppance first."

Once he was completely gone, I felt a sense of unreality.

The house hadn't changed at all, as if Brandon had never been here.

I couldn't help but ask Savannah, "Am I really divorced?"

Savannah nodded, tears in her eyes, sharing my excitement. "Caroline, you're divorced."

I couldn't help but hug her and cry.

All the pain, struggle, and heartbreak of the past few months vanished with her words.

After crying, I called Kelly.

It was late, but she answered quickly. "What's up, Caroline? I had a feeling you'd call tonight, so I stayed up. What's going on?"

I covered my mouth, trying to contain my excitement. "Mom, I'm divorced. I got full custody of the kids. Brandon's out with nothing."

Kelly was silent for a moment, then choked up. "That's wonderful, honey. Stay with me from now on, okay? Your dad left us enough money to live comfortably for the rest of our lives."

I nodded firmly. "Mom, I'll handle the rest and come back. We'll live well together."

After hanging up, I called Kathy to share the news. "Kathy, Brandon signed the divorce papers. I'm officially divorced."

"Really? Congratulations, Caroline! You're amazing!"

Her voice was filled with joy, even more excited than I was.

I chuckled. "Thanks to you, Simon, Royce, and Savannah. Without you all, I couldn't have done it."

"But it was your determination that made it happen. If it were me, I might have given up. But you kept hope alive, so you deserve this freedom."

I nodded firmly.

After hanging up, I was still too excited to sit still. "Savannah, let's go out for dinner. We need to celebrate."

She stopped me. "Caroline, shouldn't you call Mr. Castillo? He's probably waiting for your news."

I hesitated.

Royce had helped me a lot with this, and I owed him a call. But I couldn't bring myself to do it.

Seeing my hesitation, Savannah urged me. "Caroline, you should call Mr. Castillo. He hasn't slept for two days because of this."

###chapter 184

Hearing this, I couldn't help but sigh. "Alright, I'll call him now."

I dialed the number, and Royce picked up quickly. His voice was a bit raspy.

"How many days have you gone without sleep?"

"It's fine. I've been going over your company's financial reports. I can handle it. How are things on your end?"

I knew he was asking about my divorce, but at that moment, I found it hard to speak, as if admitting it would make my single status official. It felt strange.

"I..."

"I got divorced, Royce."

There was silence on the other end, making me feel anxious and nervous. I cleared my throat. "Thanks for your help during this time. Without you guys, I wouldn't have been able to go through with the divorce."

"Especially you. You've been a great support..."

As I spoke, I realized something was off. In the context of my divorce, my words sounded like a confession.

"I just wanted to say thank you."

I quickly hung up the phone.

Savannah couldn't help but laugh at me. "Caroline, what did Mr. Castillo say to you? Why is your face so red?"

I cleared my throat. "He didn't say anything. Let's go eat. Stop talking about him."

I couldn't stand Savannah's teasing gaze any longer and pulled her outside.

Savannah suggested, "How about we call Kathy and have her join us? Just the two of us isn't much fun. Joy should be shared."

I nodded, agreeing with her.

Savannah called Kathy, who quickly responded, "Okay, okay, I'll be there soon. You guys pick a place."

At this hour, there weren't many restaurants still open. Only a few roadside stalls had their lights on. We decided to go there.

Finding a place to eat was good enough; we didn't need to be picky about the environment.

Kathy arrived quickly, and we ordered some barbecue and beer, sitting at a table by the roadside.

The only sounds were the whooshing of cars and the occasional streetlight flickering. But I felt a strange sense of freedom.

Soon, the beer was served. I poured some into our glasses and raised mine.

"Today is a good day. I'll make an exception and have some beer. The environment may be simple, but it can't dampen our happiness."

They raised their glasses with me. I said, "From today on, I'm free. No more Brandon, no more Jordan family."

"My life will be filled with happiness from now on."

We clinked glasses and downed our beers in one go.

I felt a sense of relief and lightness.

Under the clear night sky, we drank one glass after another by the roadside.

Eventually, Savannah, still somewhat sober, decided to get us home.

I looked at Kathy with bleary eyes. She was throwing up, and I grabbed her. "Caught you, Kathy. You're throwing up. You need to be punished."

Kathy glanced at me. "Who's throwing up? Not me. Punish me if you want. I'm not afraid."

Savannah handed me a bottle of water. I opened it and held it out to Kathy. "Drink."

Kathy took a sip and smacked her lips. "Why doesn't this beer have any taste? Is it fake?"

"No taste?"

I didn't believe her and took a sip myself.

"You're right, it has no taste. Did the owner trick us? Let's go find him."

Savannah sighed and pulled us back. "You're drinking water. Of course, it has no taste."

"We're done here. Let's go home."

"If you keep this up, I'll call someone to deal with you."

I looked at Savannah. "This beer has no taste, and you won't let us find the owner. He must have tricked us. I won't let anyone trick me."

Kathy nodded and followed me.

Savannah sighed and made a couple of phone calls.

I looked at her. "Did you call the police? We need to catch him for selling fake beer!"

Savannah said, "You'll see who I called in a moment."

Soon, two black cars pulled up in front of us.

Royce got out of the first car, followed by Simon.

Seeing them, Savannah breathed a sigh of relief. "Mr. Castillo, Simon, thank goodness you're here. I can't handle these two drunkards."

I felt Savannah push me, and I fell into a broad chest.

"Who? Who pushed me?" I asked, confused.

Royce sounded exasperated. "How much did you drink?"

Savannah nodded. "Mr. Castillo, Caroline is all yours. Simon and I will take Kathy home."

I felt someone help me into a car.

Sitting on the soft seat, I thought I was already home and on my bed, so I took off my shoes and socks and started to sleep.

When we arrived, Royce reluctantly put my shoes back on.

In my sleep, I felt someone touching my feet, and I kicked out. "Brandon, get lost! Don't touch me, you jerk."

"We're divorced. If you touch me again, I'll call the police."

I heard a deep voice in front of me. "Open your eyes and see who I am."

I groggily opened my eyes and saw a tall figure in front of me.

It definitely wasn't Brandon. He had let himself go after we got married, gaining quite a bit of weight. Although he was still better than most, he didn't have the physique of the person in front of me.

I reached out and touched the muscles on his shoulder. They were firm and strong, clearly from regular workouts.

"Who are you, handsome? Why are you taking me home?"

The handsome man sighed. "Take a good look at who I am."

I stared at Royce for a while. "Royce?"

He nodded, satisfied. "At least you're not completely out of it. Since you recognize me, come with me."

I nodded and watched as he knelt down to patiently put my shoes and socks back on, then helped me out of the car.

He held my hand and led me forward. I looked around, confused. "Where are we?"

"My place."

I nodded and continued to follow him.

He took me to a room and pointed to the bed. "You can sleep here tonight. If you need anything, let me know."

I was still groggy but remembered I needed to shower before bed.

"Where's the bathroom? I need to shower."

He sighed and pulled me back. "You're drunk and want to shower? You might not make it out of the bathroom. Just sleep like this tonight."

He carried me to the bed and covered me with a blanket.

I looked at him, feeling a bit wronged. "Who are you? Why won't you let me shower?"

Royce chuckled softly. "I'm Royce, remember? And I'm not letting you shower because you're too drunk. Just sleep it off, okay?"

I pouted but nodded, feeling too tired to argue. "Fine, but you owe me a shower tomorrow."

He smiled, tucking me in. "Deal. Now get some rest."

As I drifted off to sleep, I felt a strange sense of comfort knowing Royce was there.

###chapter 185

"I didn't say you couldn't. If you wanna shower, do it tomorrow morning. Not now."

"I'll get you some milk, or you'll have a headache tomorrow."

At that moment, I couldn't hear anything anymore. I closed my eyes, exhausted.

When I woke up again, I was a bit annoyed.

I felt someone helping me sit up, and in my groggy state, someone was pouring something warm into my mouth.

After I finished drinking, he helped me lie back down. No one disturbed me after that, and I slept until the next morning.

When I opened my eyes, I was a bit stunned by my surroundings.

"Where am I?"

"Was I kidnapped?"

Memories from last night flooded back. I remembered the three of us drinking by the roadside. Savannah planned to take us home, but we refused to get in the car. In the end, Savannah called Royce and Simon to pick us up. Royce took me home.

I suddenly realized I was at Royce's place.

I got up and pushed open the bedroom door. Royce was sitting on the couch, leisurely reading a newspaper. Hearing the door open, he turned and glanced at me. "Awake?"

I nodded. "I didn't say anything stupid last night, did I?"

Royce chuckled. "Oh, you did. You got drunk and cried while hugging me."

"You kept saying you were divorced and wanted me to stay and be your husband."

I was stunned. I hadn't drunk in a long time. Was my behavior that bad?

But I really couldn't remember what happened after I got to Royce's place, so I had to consider the possibility that he was telling the truth.

I covered my face, feeling utterly embarrassed.

When I opened my eyes, Royce was looking at me, as if asking, "Aren't you going to explain?"

I cleared my throat. "Why take a drunk's words seriously? Just pretend I didn't say anything."

Royce snorted. "What if I took it seriously?"

My mind went blank, and my heart raced. "Then I apologize."

"Who wants your apology?"

I clutched my head, squatting down in pain. "Royce, my head hurts."

He stopped joking and came over, squatting beside me to massage my head.

"That's what you get for drinking so much last night. Your head hurts, doesn't it?"

Actually, I wasn't in pain at all. I just wanted to avoid the awkward topic. But Royce's massage felt so good that I didn't want him to stop, so I continued pretending to have a headache.

I enjoyed his massage while thinking of an excuse to leave.

When he finally stopped, I said, "You have great hands. You could open a massage parlor."

He didn't respond. "Still hurt?"

I shook my head. "Not at all. Thanks. I have some things to take care of, so I'll be going."

I grabbed my bag and stood up to leave, but Royce grabbed my hand.

"Where are you going?"

I smiled awkwardly. "I have some unresolved matters. Thanks for the massage."

"And what about what you said last night? Aren't you going to give me an answer?"

He held onto me, not letting me move.

"Don't take a drunk's words seriously. It was just a joke. None of it was real."

He looked at me silently for a moment. "But I took every word seriously."

I didn't know how to respond. The sincerity in his eyes told me he wasn't joking. He really took every word to heart.

My thoughts began to stir. I was divorced now.

Could I...?

But I quickly realized that even though I was divorced, I was still a mother of three.

No man would accept that, so there was a natural barrier between Royce and me.

A barrier that couldn't be crossed.

I calmed down and looked at Royce. "I'm sorry about last night. I didn't mean it."

"I apologize."

After I said that, Royce's eyes gradually turned cold.

He let go of my hand.

I felt a wave of sadness wash over me, making me feel uncomfortable and lost.

"I'll be going."

I turned to leave, but then I heard him say behind me, "Caroline, what are you hesitating about? You know I like you, and you like me. Why do you keep pushing me away?"

I froze, not saying a word.

He continued, "Do you know how much it hurts me every time you push me away? Have you ever considered how I feel?"

I felt like my heart was being squeezed, a wave of bitterness and suffocation overwhelming me, making it hard to breathe.

But Royce and I had missed ten years. Everything had changed in those ten years.

Even if we forced ourselves to be together now, we'd eventually break up over trivial matters. I didn't have the confidence to enter another marriage.

I also didn't have the confidence that he would accept me as a mother of three.

"I..."

I hesitated, not knowing what to say. He grabbed my shoulders and turned me around. "Tell me what you're thinking."

"Can you talk? Let me know your thoughts, and we'll solve it together."

I remained silent because I knew our problems couldn't be solved. Even if I spoke, it wouldn't help.

He sighed and let go of my shoulders.

His voice was full of disappointment and exhaustion. "Just go."

I suddenly felt a wave of panic. If I really walked away now, I might lose Royce forever.

I looked at him and couldn't help but say, "Royce, I..."

He waved his hand. "Aren't you busy? Just go. Let me cool down."

He was pushing me away. Realizing this, I felt a deep sense of loss.

I stood at the door, watching Royce light a cigarette. The smoke obscured his face.

I knew I should stay, but I had no idea how. So, I bit my lip and left.

Through the crack in the door, I saw Royce looking out the window, not at me.

My heart ached intensely. It felt like I was giving up the most important thing in my life.

But I had no choice.

If he really stayed with me, he'd realize I was a mother of three. I couldn't be a perfect wife for him. Maybe he deserved someone better.

Thinking this, I pressed the elevator button, a tear rolling down my cheek.

I had just ended a marriage that had tormented me for nearly ten years.

Maybe it was God's punishment, leaving me alone.

###chapter 186

When I got home, Savannah was still asleep.

She'd been on edge for a while, always on high alert, and last night she had a few drinks. I figured she was exhausted from sticking by my side, protecting me all these months, so I let her sleep.

Just then, Kelly called me. "Hey Caroline, have you eaten yet?"

I rubbed my forehead. "I just woke up."

It hit me that I needed to tell Brett and the kids about my divorce from Brandon. Yves and Aria were too young to understand, but Brett would definitely realize that Brandon and I were splitting up. I worried about how he would take it.

"Mom, is Brett around?"

"No, he's not. What's up?"

"When do you think I should tell Brett about the divorce? Should I just tell him now?"

"If you ask me, there's no need to rush. Wait until you can tell him in person. It's not the kind of thing you should say over the phone."

I nodded, worried that Brett wouldn't accept the divorce.

Kelly seemed to sense my anxiety. "Don't overthink it. Brett might be happier than you expect."

I nodded again, trying to stay positive.

After hanging up, Savannah woke up and saw me. "Caroline, you're back. When did you get in?"

"I've been back for a bit. Why didn't you keep sleeping?"

"I'm awake now."

She suddenly gave me a curious look. "How did your talk with Mr. Castillo go?"

Mentioning Royce made my heart sink. I sighed.

Seeing my expression, she froze. "What do you mean, Caroline?"

"I turned Royce down," I said quietly.

She stared at me in disbelief. "Why? It's obvious Mr. Castillo likes you. Why would you reject him?"

"And Mr. Castillo is definitely a thousand times better than that jerk Brandon."

"Most importantly, he's been waiting for you all these years. That alone makes him better than Brandon."

I nodded. "I know all that, but I'm divorced now, with three kids."

"Even if it's not Royce, any normal guy would have reservations about being with me. Royce just doesn't say it."

"Maybe because he's waited so long, he feels a sense of responsibility. But he doesn't love me anymore. So I can't just jump into a relationship with him."

"Royce deserves someone better, not someone who comes with the baggage of being a stepdad to my kids."

Savannah sighed deeply.

"Caroline, I get what you're saying, but don't you regret it?"

Regret? I thought of Royce's face and sighed again. Of course, I liked him.

But too much time had passed. We were no longer right for each other.

God is a good storyteller. Maybe this is all part of a bigger plan.

Maybe Royce will find someone he loves and who loves him back. That person just isn't me.

I thought, feeling a bit pessimistic.

"It's all in the past," I told Savannah.

Then I went upstairs to my room, needing some quiet time to sort out my thoughts.

Just then, Leo called.

I stared at the caller ID, surprised. Why was Leo calling? I had already told him I'd bring Briar back when school started.

Did he have something else to discuss?

I answered, and he said, "Caroline, can we meet up?"

This made me even more curious. Leo wouldn't ask to meet without a good reason, especially since he knew about my divorce from Brandon. I had announced it on Facebook.

"Don't get the wrong idea, Caroline. I'm not here to talk about Brandon. I just want to chat."

This made me even more curious. What did Leo want to talk about? Our only common topic was Briar.

But I agreed, wanting to know what he had to say.

I brought Savannah along and went to the restaurant Leo had mentioned.

He was already there, waving when he saw me. Savannah sat at a nearby booth.

Sitting across from Leo, I asked, "Leo, what's this about?"

"I heard about you and Brandon. It's a shame, really. You had ten years of marriage."

I chuckled. "Nothing to be ashamed of. He wronged me first."

Leo paused, then nodded. "You're right. The divorce is a good thing. You're free now."

"Actually..."

"Leo, just say it. No need to beat around the bush."

Leo nodded. "It's nothing major. I just wanted to ask if you'll come to Mom's funeral."

"After all, you were her daughter-in-law for ten years. I thought you might want to come when we lay her to rest in a few days."

I frowned. Leo was such a nice guy, still thinking of inviting me.

"I won't go. I'm divorced now. It has nothing to do with me."

"Maybe you should go. I think Mom would be happy."

I couldn't help but laugh coldly. "No way. She always disliked me. Even Elora was more favored."

"My presence would only make things worse."

"How can you say that? Didn't she give you some money?"

I paused, realizing the real reason for this conversation. It was about money.

With the company gone, those who relied on it had no income. Renee's money had always come from the company.

Though Leo claimed they lived modestly, they had a mansion, designer clothes, luxury bags, and nice cars. Hardly a modest life.

Living in luxury is easy; going back to modesty is hard.

They were desperate for money.

I sipped my coffee. "That money was for burying Jason and her together."

Leo glanced at me, trying to gauge if I was telling the truth. "So there's not much left? Mom's life's savings were with you."

###chapter 187

"Yeah, it's not a lot of money."

Maybe it wasn't much to me, but to them, it was probably a fortune.

Leo smoothly changed the subject. "So, how's Briar doing with you?"

I nodded. "Briar's been great. I'm worried she might not want to go back."

Leo chuckled. "That's good to hear. Honestly, I'm always busy making money and don't have much time for her. Renee doesn't come around often either. She's probably happy with you, feeling the warmth of a real home."

I couldn't help but frown. "Leo, if Renee's like that, why don't you just divorce her?"

I really didn't get it. Leo and Renee-was it true love? Leo seemed unhappy about so many things, so why was he putting up with it? There had to be more to the story.

But now that I was finally divorced from Brandon, I didn't want to get involved, so I didn't push further.

"It's tough for everyone."

"Enough about me. Congrats on your divorce and your newfound freedom."

"Do you plan on finding someone new?"

I shook my head. "No plans for that. I just want to focus on raising these kids at my mom's place. That'll be my mission accomplished."

He nodded and glanced at his phone, as if someone had messaged him.

"It's getting late, and I have things to do. Caroline, let's catch up another time. I gotta go."

I said goodbye, and Savannah came back from the booth behind us to sit across from me.

I smiled at Savannah. "Did you catch what he was getting at?"

Savannah looked puzzled and shook her head. "It seemed like he was just making small talk."

"Small talk? He wants the money Karen left me."

"That's what he was hinting at. Didn't you catch that?"

Savannah thought back to the conversation and then nodded in realization.

"No wonder he randomly started chatting with you. He was after that money. Otherwise, why would he bring it up?"

"Just wait. Others will probably call me about it too. Karen must not have left them anything, and they're probably really upset about it."

"But the more they want it, the less I'll give. I'll never let them know how much Karen left me. Let them keep guessing and getting more jealous."

Savannah couldn't help but give me a thumbs up. "You're playing the psychology game perfectly. They're probably in agony."

Savannah and I got up to pay the bill. "Serves them right."

I suddenly realized I hadn't told Asher about my divorce yet. I sent Savannah home and took a cab to Asher's place.

She wanted to come with me, but I refused. "We might talk for a while. You go home and wait. No need to stick around."

She nodded. "Alright, Caroline. Call me when you're ready to go, and I'll come get you."

After parting ways with Savannah, I headed over to Asher's place. He was staying in one of Royce's apartments.

When I arrived, he was still working out, his muscles already well-defined.

"You're so disciplined, Asher," I said, admiring his dedication.

He flashed a bright smile at me. "You still remember me?"

"Of course I do. Why am I the last to hear about your divorce?"

"I was just too happy yesterday, went out drinking with Kathy and the others, and got carried away."

"I came to tell you first thing today. Didn't want you to find out late. Besides, you already knew."

He laughed. "If it weren't for my call with Royce, I wouldn't have known."

"But when I called Royce, he sounded down. What did you say to him? Shouldn't he be happy about your divorce?"

My smile faltered, and I waved it off. "Let's not talk about him. I brought some snacks. Let's have a feast."

"At least you came prepared. Let me clean up, and we'll eat."

After we sat down at the table, I told him all the details about my divorce from Brandon.

Asher nodded, looking a bit worried. "But you need to be careful. Brandon's a schemer. He might try something else. Don't let him succeed."

I nodded. "Don't worry. I've thought about that. I know Brandon won't give up easily."

"But I won't let him win. Once he pays back that million dollars, I'll send him straight to jail."

Asher nodded. "Just be careful."

I nodded. "Don't worry. Once the company is back on track, you can take over."

"Are you serious, Caroline? I thought you were joking."

I shook my head. "I'm serious. This place holds too many bad memories. I don't want to stay here. I trust you to take over. I can't think of anyone else."

"No matter what, you'll always be the major shareholder. Anytime you want it back, it's yours," Asher said.

I raised my glass to him. "Maybe you'll be the big shot in the construction industry one day, and I'll have to borrow money from you."

"Do we even need to talk about borrowing? Just tell me how much you need. I'm your bank."

"That's what I wanted to hear, Asher."

After chatting with Asher, I called Savannah, and she quickly came to pick me up.

I didn't drink as much as yesterday, but I was still a bit tipsy. Savannah saw my smile and said, "Caroline, you seem really happy."

I nodded. "I am. This is the happiest I've been in a while. Everything's finally settled, and the company's in good hands."

"Now I just need to wrap up a few things and head back to my mom's."

"How could I not be happy? Everything's going in the right direction."

She smiled. "Definitely worth celebrating."

After Savannah took me home, I collapsed into bed and slept deeply. When I woke up, it was already evening.

###chapter 188

When I woke up, I saw a bunch of missed calls on my phone, all from Irene.

I headed downstairs and found Savannah lounging on the couch.

I held up my phone for her to see. "See? I told you. They're all after the money Karen left me."

Savannah rolled her eyes. "This family must be really desperate."

"So, what do we do, Caroline? They keep bugging you. Blocking their numbers won't stop them from finding other ways to get to you. What's the plan?"

I chuckled softly. "Don't worry, I've got a plan."

I texted Irene, setting up a meeting for the next day at noon.

Savannah looked surprised. "Caroline, meeting her now might just make her cling to you even more."

"Trust me, it won't. Come with me to the bank tomorrow morning."

The next morning, Savannah and I went to the bank. I withdrew $400,000 from the $5 million I had and split it into two separate accounts.

I met Irene first. She was wearing sunglasses and her clothes were no longer designer brands. It seemed like she had downgraded her lifestyle since the company went under. Maybe that's why she was so desperate for money.

"Finally, you're here. I thought you wouldn't show up."

Irene took off her sunglasses and glared at me. "You've divorced Brandon, so give me Karen's money. How can you shamelessly keep our family's money?"

"And you had the nerve to kick Brandon out with nothing. Do you know how much he sacrificed for this family? You should give him half of your assets."

I couldn't help but laugh. "Give him half? Why?"

"Didn't I build the company from scratch? Brandon just took credit for my work and ran it into the ground. I'm being generous by not asking him for money. Don't you think your family should compensate me?"

"Compensate you? Dream on."

"Let me tell you, Caroline. The company's collapse has nothing to do with us. We did our best."

Her audacity made me laugh. "Nothing to do with you? Irene, don't think I don't know about the $10 million you embezzled from the company."

Her eyes flickered with panic. She hadn't expected me to know about that.

"Who told you?"

"Do you think I'm naive? I can audit the accounts. Do you want me to hand you over to the police right now?"

Her bravado deflated. "Brandon said he'd repay that money. Even if you turn me in, it won't matter."

"And let me tell you, since you're divorced, Karen's money must go to me."

Seeing she couldn't win the argument, she resorted to being unreasonable.

"Otherwise, you're not leaving today."

I chuckled. "Of course, I'll give it to you. I don't need your family's money. I came here today to give you the money."

I pushed one of the bank cards towards her. "There's $200,000 on this card."

Irene's face twisted with anger. She slammed the table and stood up. "Only $200,000? You're kidding, right? Karen couldn't have left just this much money."

"Did you pocket the rest? Hand it over. I don't believe you."

"If you don't believe me, you can check. See how much money Karen had. This amount is after deducting the cost of Jason's funeral."

"Why would we pay for Jason's funeral? He's not our family."

I smiled at Irene. "Aren't you afraid Karen will come after you for saying that? She told me this herself before she died. You can ask her."

Irene gritted her teeth, eyeing the $200,000 on the table. She wanted it but felt it wasn't enough.

Back when she was the CFO at my company, $200,000 was just her monthly expense.

"Do you want it or not? If not, I'll take it back."

"Renee's husband, Leo, also asked me for this $200,000 yesterday. But I chose to give it to you because you were decent to me once."

"And think about how Karen treated me. Do you really think she would leave me a lot of money? This is all there is. Do you expect me to give you more out of my own pocket?"

Irene's expression softened. She quickly grabbed the bank card. "Fine, I'll take it. This money is mine now."

"Sure, but you can't tell anyone else. If they come asking for money, I'll send them to you."

"If anyone finds out I gave you the money, I'll sue to get it back. Karen's will stated the money was for me, so legally, it's mine. If you take my money, I can sue to reclaim it."

Irene waved her hand impatiently. "Got it, got it. It's just some money. What a hassle."

After she left with the money, Savannah turned around from the booth behind me and gave me a thumbs up. "Caroline, that was brilliant. I get it now."

I smiled at her. "What do you get?"

"You told Irene you'd only give her $200,000 and not to tell anyone. Then you'll give the other $200,000 to someone else who wants the money and tell them the same thing. Each person thinks they got the money, so they won't talk, and they won't bother you again."

I nodded. "Exactly."

"Who are you giving the other $200,000 to?"

"Leo. He's the only other one in the Jordan family interested in this money."

I handed the other bank card to Savannah. "Can you deliver this to Leo and let me know when it's done? I'll call him afterward."

Savannah nodded eagerly and left with the $200,000.

After Savannah delivered the money, Leo called me before I could call him. "Ms. Sharp, what is this about?"

"Please, call me Caroline. This money was meant for Jason's funeral, as Karen wanted. I checked with the cemetery, and after the funeral, this is what was left."

"Irene came to me for the money, but I couldn't give it to her. I decided to give it to you instead, since you have a child to care for."

###chapter 189

"No, Caroline, my life's fine without it. You should keep the money. It's not like I care about you having some extra cash."

"Yeah, I know $200,000 isn't much to you, but isn't this for the kids? Just keep it and use it for them when you need to. Think of it as a little bonus. I definitely don't want to give it to Irene. After thinking it over, it's better in your hands."

"Irene's a gambler. Who knows what she'd do with it?"

"And if she blows it all and comes back to me, what then? What if she gets hooked? So, I gave it to you. You can use it for the kids."

"Besides, this money was originally Karen's. You deserve a share. But I have one request, Leo: don't tell Irene. She'll come after me again. She already gave me a headache today. I barely got rid of her. Once I get back to Suncrest City, she won't be able to find me, and that'll be the end of it. I'm just worried she'll come after you if you tell her."

After a lot of convincing, Leo finally nodded in agreement.

"Alright, Caroline. Thanks on behalf of Briar."

"I'll keep this money for Briar."

"By the way, Leo, when's Karen's funeral? I might not be able to go, but you never know. Let me know, and I might show up."

Leo nodded and gave me the date for Karen's funeral.

After hanging up, I let out a deep breath, relieved that the money issue was settled.

Next, I needed to see if we could catch Earl. This was the last thing I had to do for the Jordan family. Only by catching Earl could Jason be laid to rest, and he could find peace in the afterlife.

I informed Simon about the date, asking them to keep a close watch around the funeral home that day.

Simon assured me, "Don't worry. On the day of the funeral, we'll have the place on lockdown. If Earl shows up, we'll nab him on the spot. He won't get away."

Feeling reassured, I focused on enjoying a meal with Savannah.

But halfway through, I spotted a familiar figure outside. It was Paula.

I hadn't seen her in ages, not since she helped out with Kathy's situation. She probably knew she had deceived me and was avoiding me. I hadn't had the chance to confront her.

To my surprise, there she was. I shifted my gaze and saw a tall figure next to her.

I quickly nudged Savannah. "Look, isn't that Earl?"

Savannah followed my gaze and nodded vigorously. "That's Earl! What are they doing together? Why are Earl and Paula together now?"

I smirked. "It's not hard to understand. Paula was helping Earl by diverting attention when she lied about Kathy being in that building. Paula works for Renee. She lied to me, saying she was forced."

"Paula may be young, but she's cunning, way harder to deal with than her sister Shirley."

Savannah and I left the restaurant and watched Paula and Earl get into a cab.

We quickly hailed a cab and followed them.

If they were leaving town, it would be a disaster.

The route became more remote, like they were heading to the outskirts. I asked the driver where we were going, and he said, "This is the road to Sky Dome Mountain Airport. Aren't you going there too? I thought you were with them."

I nodded absentmindedly and called Simon. "Simon, Savannah and I are following Earl and Paula. They're heading to Sky Dome Mountain Airport. If they leave the country, we won't catch them."

Simon remained calm. "Don't worry. We have the airport covered. If Earl shows up, we'll arrest him. They won't escape."

"Come back. Don't expose yourselves. Earl might be armed, and it could be dangerous. We have people at the airport. Karen's funeral is soon. He won't leave without seeing her one last time."

"Trust me, he'll stay. We have eyes on the hospital. He hasn't seen Karen yet. He'll stay."

Reassured by Simon's calm voice, we returned to the city.

We decided to visit Kathy on the way back.

She was back at work but seemed paranoid, having hired two burly male employees to prevent any incidents.

When we arrived, she was frowning at a dress.

Seeing us, Kathy smiled. "What brings you two here?"

I explained our recent adventure and how we decided to visit her afterward.

"Since you're here, let's grab some coffee and have afternoon tea. My treat."

We agreed and went to a nearby café.

We speculated about Earl's sudden trip to the airport.

"Do you think he's picking someone up?" Kathy asked.

I shook my head. "Paula could do that alone. Why bring Earl, who's being hunted by the police? Who could be that important?"

"Maybe he's trying to escape, thinking it's not worth seeing Karen one last time."

"But if that were the case, he would've left already. Why wait until now?"

"We don't know. Their actions are a mystery."

After discussing it for a while without any conclusions, we decided to wait for Simon's update on Earl and Paula's whereabouts.

"By the way, now that you're divorced, any progress with Royce?" Kathy asked, sipping her coffee.

Savannah sighed dramatically. "Don't ask, Kathy."

"What happened?"

I kicked Savannah under the table to keep her quiet, but Kathy noticed. "Why'd you kick me?"

Savannah laughed, covering her mouth. "She was kicking me to keep me quiet."

###chapter 190

Kathy eyed us suspiciously. "What are you two whispering about? What's going on?"

Ignoring my warning look, Savannah blurted out, "Caroline turned down Mr. Castillo."

"What?" Kathy's eyes nearly popped out of her head. "Caroline, are you nuts? Do you know how many women would kill for a shot with Royce, and you turned him down?"

"Have you lost your mind hanging out with Brandon too much?"

I sighed, knowing I couldn't stop Kathy.

"Royce and I are from different worlds now. I'm a mom with three kids. Why would I drag Royce down?"

"Royce probably doesn't even like me anymore. He's just sticking around out of a sense of duty. If I reject him, it saves him the trouble and spares his pride. Why not do him that favor?"

"You're crazy, Caroline. Royce genuinely likes you. How could that be fake?"

"Come on, even an average guy would think twice about dating a woman with three kids. Let alone someone as exceptional as Royce."

Feeling a bit down, I said, "Please, stop trying to convince me. Royce and I are from different worlds. We're just not right for each other, and I can't hold him back."

Kathy slammed the table and stood up, "Where's your confidence, Caroline? No matter what, believe me, you deserve any man in the world. You are more than enough."

"Has Brandon's manipulation gotten to you? What are you thinking?"

"Royce is a rare gem. If you miss this chance, you'll regret it. Are you really willing to let someone else have him?"

I took a sip of my coffee, listening to their words.

They were all trying to persuade me, looking disappointed.

But I couldn't take in a word they said. I knew better than anyone how great Royce was.

But how could I burden him with three kids?

They talked until their mouths were dry, finally sighing and taking a sip of coffee. "Fine, we won't try to convince you anymore, but you'll regret this, Caroline."

"What you lack most right now is confidence. You should believe that you deserve any man in the world, and no man is good enough for you. That's the mindset you need."

Savannah nodded in agreement. "Exactly, Kathy's right."

I sighed helplessly. "Can we stop talking about this? I'm already stressed out."

They exchanged glances and fell silent.

They meant well, trying to stop me from missing out on Royce, but they also understood my insecurities and helplessness.

"Alright, let's change the subject. What do you want to eat? It's on me."

I shook my head. "I'm not hungry. I just had a meal."

"Okay, but don't be so down. If you choose to miss out on Royce, why are you so upset? Deep down, you still like him."

Of course, I liked Royce.

He was my first love. Even though I married Brandon and tried to forget him, my heart still raced when I saw him again.

But our story had to end here. There was no future for us.

Just then, Simon called. "Caroline, Earl went to the airport with Paula, but they just circled around and came back. I don't know if they noticed our surveillance, so they returned."

"And they didn't seem like they were planning to leave. They had no luggage."

"For Earl, the smaller the target, the safer. He might just take money and buy what he needs at his destination."

Simon sounded puzzled. "It didn't look like they were trying to leave. They seemed to be just strolling around the airport. As soon as our people spotted them, they got into a black car and left, like they were prepared."

"If they were escaping, they wouldn't have a black car waiting nearby. And we've lost track of that car."

"So, it looks like they might show up at Karen's funeral. You should thoroughly check the funeral."

"Yes, that's our last chance to catch Earl."

I hung up the phone, and Kathy couldn't help but sigh.

"How are you still tangled up with the Jordan family after the divorce? They're such a pain."

I nodded in agreement. "You're right. They're a bunch of jerks. They even asked me for money today."

Kathy's eyes widened. "What happened? Why didn't you tell me?"

I recounted how Irene had asked me for money this morning. Kathy frowned, looking disgusted.

"Being married to someone like that is like being in prison. It's infuriating that she's asking you for money after bankrupting your company. You should sue her and make her pay your salary."

I chuckled. "Don't worry, it's not the right time yet. I'll deal with Irene eventually. I'm still gathering evidence with Asher's help. Once I have proof that she transferred company funds to her personal account, she won't be able to escape."

After talking with Kathy, Savannah and I went home, while Kathy returned to her studio.

Then I noticed Savannah sneaking around, chatting with someone. I raised an eyebrow. "Are you talking to Kirk? I didn't realize you two were getting so close."

Savannah looked a bit guilty and nodded. "Yeah, I'm chatting with Kirk. Why?"

I immediately sensed something was off. If she was chatting with Kirk, she wouldn't look like this.

"Who are you really talking to? Let me see."

Savannah tried to hide her phone, but I sternly said, "Don't move. Let me see."

She froze, hiding her phone behind her back.

I stepped forward and grabbed her phone. When I looked at the screen, I saw it was Royce's chat window, but the messages had been deleted.

###chapter 191

"What were you talking about with Royce?"

I stared at Savannah, trying to read her expression.

"Just some stuff, really. Nothing to do with you, Caroline."

I laughed. Savannah was a terrible liar. She was totally giving herself away.

"What did you talk to him about me?"

"Nothing, I swear! I didn't talk to Mr. Castillo about you, just some other things. Believe me, I really didn't talk about you."

She blinked earnestly.

I pressed her, "Spill it, or I'll kick you out and you won't be around me anymore."

"Please, Caroline, I'm sorry."

Savannah immediately pleaded, "Actually, Mr. Castillo is just worried about you. He's concerned that jerk Brandon might try to get back at you, so he asked if there was anything unusual around you."

I frowned. That seemed reasonable enough, but I didn't get why Savannah was being so secretive.

"Then why were you sneaking around?"

"Because you don't want me to mention Mr. Castillo. I was afraid if I openly messaged him, you'd see it and get upset. So I tried to be discreet, but you still caught me..."

Her voice trailed off, sounding more and more pitiful, "Caroline, I really didn't say anything to Mr. Castillo."

"Alright, thank him for me. Tell him I'll be back in Suncrest City soon, so he doesn't need to worry. I'll handle things myself."

Savannah's eyes widened slightly, "So you won't need me then?"

I patted her head, "Don't worry, it won't be him hiring you, it'll be me personally."

Savannah finally smiled and nodded, "Okay."

She seemed genuinely happy, even humming a tune on her way to the kitchen. I looked at her helplessly and shook my head.

I went back to my room, planning to rest for a bit.

Just then, Simon called, saying he needed to come over.

I was taken aback, realizing it must be something important for him to want to talk in person, so I nodded and told him to come.

Kathy came along too, which surprised me since we had just parted ways.

Kathy said, "Simon told me something big is about to happen here, so I dropped everything. What's going on?"

I shook my head, "I don't know, let's wait for Simon to explain."

We all sat on the couch, Simon across from us. He said, "It's about Isadora's sister, Celestia. I've found some leads."

We exchanged excited glances. I asked, "Why not call Isadora over? She'd be thrilled to hear about Celestia."

Simon shook his head, "She's pregnant right now. I'm not sure if we should tell her because the truth is pretty harsh."

I was stunned, "Tell us first. We'll decide whether to tell Isadora."

But she does have the right to know the truth, so eventually, she will find out, sooner or later.

"The person who hit Celestia has been found."

Kathy slammed the table, "Who is that bastard?"

"We found out the person who hit Isadora's family went to prison, but somehow he's not there anymore. He was sentenced to twenty years for killing Celestia and her family, so he should still be serving time."

I nodded, "What do you mean he's not in prison? Did someone get him out?"

Simon nodded, "That's the key point. The guy who hit Isadora's family is named Knox, just an ordinary driver barely making ends meet."

"But he somehow made a major invention in prison, earning an early release for good behavior."

I frowned, "That sounds fishy. If he was that talented, why didn't he invent something before? It must be Alfonso and his people who helped Knox get out."

Simon nodded, "Yes, I suspect that's the case, but we have no evidence. Now Knox is out of prison and not even in the country."

"Not in the country? What do you mean?"

"I mean Knox and his family emigrated after his release."

"We tried to trace if Alfonso paid Knox, but there are no records of any transactions. It's strange."

"So this family was poor all along, but suddenly had money to emigrate after Knox's release."

Simon continued, "We found out Knox's family was sent abroad by a foreign trade boss who has some connections with Alfonso."

"But their public relationship is minimal, not enough to prove Alfonso hired Knox to kill Celestia's family. It could be a misunderstanding, or Alfonso covered his tracks too well."

After Simon finished, I understood why he said the truth was harsh. Should we let Isadora hear this?

This wasn't just harsh; it was devastating.

Isadora has been waiting for the truth to come out, hoping someone would bring Alfonso to justice. But if she hears this, it would break her heart, and her pregnancy could be at risk.

"We're still investigating, trying to find evidence of Knox and Alfonso's connection, but right now, we're powerless."

"If Isadora could get some evidence from Alfonso's side, the case might progress. But Alfonso is very discreet. From the outside, everything looks clean. He can always claim it's a coincidence, with no solid proof."

We all sighed, wondering how things had come to this.

I never thought that even after divorcing Brandon, Isadora's case would become even more tangled.

I gritted my teeth, "Don't tell Isadora for now. Her pregnancy is the priority. I'm sure Celestia wouldn't want her to find out at this time."

"If anyone's to blame, let it be me."

###chapter 192

Just then, I suddenly thought of Marshall.

I clapped my hands. "None of us really have the right to decide what happens next. After all, we're all outsiders. But I know someone who can."

Everyone turned to look at me and asked, "Who?"

"Isadora's husband, Marshall."

Simon frowned, thinking for a moment. "I know him. His family has some money, and being a cop is more of a hobby for him. Plus, he really loves Isadora."

"Maybe telling him first is the right move. Let him decide whether to tell Isadora. He's very serious and meticulous about his work, and we all hold him in high regard."

Satisfied, I nodded. "Simon, could you arrange a meeting with him for me? I'll talk to him. I've met him a few times."

Simon nodded and agreed.

He set up a meeting for me with Marshall at a coffee shop the next afternoon.

When I arrived, Marshall was already there, holding a glass of iced water. He stood out in the crowd with his tall stature and broad shoulders.

"Hey, good to see you again."

He nodded, looking a bit puzzled. "Why did you want to meet up? As far as I know, we don't know each other well, but you're close with my wife. Why not talk to her?"

I pressed my lips together. This guy really was straightforward, saying exactly what was on his mind.

He should have exchanged some pleasantries, but instead, he pointed out our lack of familiarity.

I cleared my throat. "You're right, we don't know each other well. I'm here because of Isadora."

At the mention of Isadora, his expression softened, and I couldn't help but feel a bit envious. This was what true love looked like-just hearing the other's name brought a smile.

"What about Isadora?"

"You know she asked my friend to look into Celestia's case, right?"

Marshall frowned slightly, then nodded. "I know. But the case was closed, ruled as an accidental car crash. I can't reopen it. I heard she hired a private detective."

I nodded. "Yes, that detective is my friend."

Marshall's stern face softened a bit. "I don't really trust those private detectives to uncover the truth, but Isadora was so invested in finding out what happened to Celestia. I was worried about her, so I agreed."

I studied his face, looking for any sign of doubt. "Do you believe her? From your perspective, the case is closed. Do you believe Isadora when she says Alfonso killed his sister?"

Marshall nodded firmly. "I believe Isadora."

Relieved, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. His support was crucial.

"We've uncovered some new information, but we're hesitant to tell Isadora because she's pregnant."

"So I wanted to talk to you first. You can decide whether to tell her now or wait until after the baby is born."

"Alright, tell me what you know."

I recounted everything Simon and I had discussed.

Marshall listened intently, then asked, "Your friend is also with the police, right?"

I couldn't help but admire his sharp instincts. "Sorry, he prefers to stay anonymous. Just keep it to yourself."

Marshall nodded understandingly. "Thank you for your friend's help. I won't tell Isadora for now, but I'm willing to assist with the investigation. Let me know if you need anything."

"No matter what, I want to give Isadora the truth."

I couldn't help but nod, thinking Isadora was lucky to have such a good man.

After he left, I returned to the car outside the restaurant. Savannah was waiting for me. She asked, "How did it go? Smoothly?"

I nodded. "Couldn't have gone better. Marshall was surprisingly cooperative and even willing to help with the investigation. He even guessed Simon's identity."

Savannah's eyes widened in shock. "He's really sharp. But it's good he's willing to help."

I nodded. "We have to keep this from Isadora. If she finds out, she'll be heartbroken, and that's not good for the baby."

Savannah nodded in agreement. "Right. Also, I remembered something. Alfonso, Celestia's ex-husband, seems to have some connection with Brandon."

"Remember when Brandon threw that celebration party and specifically invited Alfonso? They're not even in the same industry, so why would they be so close?"

"I saw Brandon personally call Alfonso to invite him, and they acted very familiar with each other. At the time, I thought he was just calling a friend, but now I realize Alfonso is Celestia's ex-husband."

I sneered. "Brandon really knows how to pick his friends. Maybe he learned how to be a scumbag from Alfonso."

Savannah nodded. "Exactly. How do these awful people make so much money?"

"The world is really unfair."

I patted her shoulder. "The truth is, people with too much conscience don't make big money. I only built this company with my dad's help and our family's gradual accumulation. Otherwise, I could never have achieved this scale on my own."

"And Alfonso, starting from scratch, couldn't have built such a big company in just a few years without some shady dealings."

"But you have to believe in karma. People like him will get what they deserve eventually."

Savannah sighed heavily. "I hope so."

When I got home, I received a call from Kelly. I was surprised she called at this time.

Kelly said, "Didn't the kids miss a vaccine? How could you forget?"

I was stunned, then remembered. I had planned to bring the kids back for their vaccines but got so caught up in everything that I forgot.

I felt a wave of guilt, blaming myself for being a bad mom who couldn't even remember her kids' vaccine schedule.

###chapter 193

Kelly said, "Alright, I know you're swamped, so I had Holly take the kids over. Their flight lands at 8 PM tonight. Make sure to pick them up. She's got her hands full with the kids."

I nodded quickly and said, "Thanks, Mom. I don't know what I'd do without you."

Kelly chuckled softly, a bit helplessly, "You're a mom yourself now, but sometimes I feel like you're still a kid who hasn't grown up."

"Just go ahead and do whatever you need to do. I've got your back."

I wasn't sure if Kelly had sensed something recently, because I hadn't told her about my recent experiences, but her words made my eyes well up.

Yeah, go ahead and do it. It's no big deal. With Kelly around, if I fail, I can just go back to her with the three kids.

After hanging up, Savannah noticed I looked a bit down and quickly asked what was wrong.

I said, "I feel like I'm not a good mom. I even forgot about the kids' vaccination schedule. Holly's bringing them back tonight for their shots. Can you come with me to pick them up?"

Savannah nodded quickly and reassured me, "Caroline, don't overthink it. Things have been so hectic lately. Who could remember everything?"

"If you could juggle all this and still keep track of the kids' vaccinations, you'd be a saint. So let's not be too hard on ourselves. We didn't miss the appointment, did we?"

With Savannah's comfort, I felt much better and nodded, "Don't worry, I won't be too hard on myself. I'll do what I can and leave the rest to fate."

That evening, Holly's flight landed in Seaside City.

Savannah and I stood at the airport exit and saw Holly struggling forward, carrying one child in her arms, another on her back, and a suitcase in her hand.

I quickly went up to help, "Sorry for the trouble, Holly. Thanks for making the trip back."

Holly smiled warmly, "It's no trouble. I'm the youngest in my family, always helping my siblings with their kids. I've handled three or four at a time before. These two fell asleep as soon as we got on the plane and haven't woken up yet. They're really well-behaved."

I glanced back and saw Yves sleeping soundly on Holly's back, his head resting on her shoulder, looking completely innocent.

Aria, in front, had just woken up and was curiously looking around the terminal.

My heart melted. I took Yves from Holly to lighten her load, and Savannah took Aria.

"Holly, have you eaten? How about we go home first and then grab dinner?"

"No need, I ate on the plane and I'm not hungry. I fed the kids too. Let's just head home."

I nodded, and after Savannah helped us into the car, Holly and I sat in the back with the kids while Savannah drove.

I put the kids in their car seats and kept them entertained.

The car was filled with the sound of children's laughter, which was heartwarming.

"Looks like the kids weren't bothered by the long flight at all," Holly remarked, watching the kids laugh.

"You wouldn't believe it. There were other kids on the plane who cried because of ear pressure, but ours fell asleep right away. Even the flight attendants praised them and said they'd give them a little gift."

I smiled, "Really? That's awesome."

I had recently bought a new house, and one room was specifically set up as a nursery for Yves and Aria. When they grow older, it will become a playroom.

We put the kids in their cribs, and they fell asleep again.

The three of us adults sat on the couch and chatted. I asked Holly, "How's my mom been lately?"

"Taking care of three kids is exhausting for me. It must be tough for you two with four kids, right?"

Holly waved her hand, "Not at all. Brett and Briar are very independent. They play outside and come back when they're hungry. They don't cry or fuss. It's not hard at all."

"We just need to look after Yves and Aria, and with Mrs. Sharp's help, it's manageable."

"Mrs. Sharp still exercises every morning. She's in great shape."

Hearing this, I felt relieved and nodded, "That's good. I have a few things to wrap up here, then I'll come back and bring Briar home. I need to personally hand her over to her dad to feel at ease."

We chatted for a while longer, but since Holly was older and needed rest, we all went to our rooms.

As soon as I got to my room, Simon called.

"Caroline, are you asleep?"

"You called me, and you're asking if I'm asleep? Obviously, I'm not."

Maybe it was because of Yves and Aria's arrival, but I felt light-hearted enough to joke with him.

Simon seemed surprised, "You sound really happy today, Caroline."

Usually, our calls were serious or filled with frustration, never this relaxed.

"I got divorced, and now my kids are here. How could I not be happy? What's up?"

Simon cleared his throat and got serious, "Caroline, you know Karen's funeral is tomorrow."

"We're certain Earl will show up, but we've decided not to arrest him yet."

I was stunned, "Not arrest Earl? Why? This is a rare chance. What if he leaves town?"

"If he escapes abroad, we'll never get another chance. What are you thinking?"

"Caroline, calm down and listen. We've analyzed that Earl must have someone behind him. He's not capable of reaching the higher-ups abroad on his own."

"So we plan to use Earl as bait to draw out the mastermind. This is a big fish, and Earl is just a small fry."

"If we don't let Earl go, we might never get a chance to catch the real culprits. So I..."

Hearing this, I started to understand and nodded, "Alright, you must have your reasons. What do you need me to do?"

This kind of internal police matter shouldn't be shared with me, but if Simon was calling, there had to be a reason.

###chapter 194

Simon cleared his throat. "We need you to go to Karen's funeral."

"As our informant."

I held the phone in silence as he continued, "Caroline, I know you really don't want anything to do with the Jordan family right now, but you're the only one who can get into Karen's funeral without raising suspicion. Anyone else would be questioned."

"So after a lot of back and forth, we decided to ask you. Royce was against it, though. He thinks it's too dangerous for you and didn't want me to call, but with the funeral tomorrow, this is our last shot. I had no other choice but to reach out."

"Caroline, if you're not up for it, we can figure something else out."

I was quiet for a long time. I really didn't want to get involved with the Jordan family again. Since my divorce, I had cut all ties with them.

But now, I had no choice but to get involved again.

I thought of Jason, that sweet kid, swept away by the merciless waves. He must have felt so much fear and despair before he died.

He was the same age as Brett.

I couldn't let Earl get away with it, let the real culprit who hurt Jason go unpunished.

I gritted my teeth. "I'll do it. Don't worry."

Simon sounded relieved. "Great! I'll make the arrangements and tell you exactly what to do. Get a good night's sleep tonight. The funeral is in the afternoon, so we have plenty of time."

I nodded and hung up, exhaling deeply.

I never thought I'd be seeing them again under these circumstances.

To be honest, I was a bit nervous about participating in this kind of operation for the first time.

But for Jason, I was willing to do anything.

I went to Savannah's room to tell her what I had to do the next day.

Savannah looked worried. "Caroline, you know how dirty and underhanded the Jordan family can be. I don't feel comfortable with you going alone. Let me come with you."

"You can't come in with me, or they'll get suspicious. But you can wait outside and keep an eye out."

"This is the only way to help Simon and the others. I'm willing to do it. If anything happens, you can rush in."

Savannah frowned for a long time before nodding.

"Alright, but if anything happens, call me immediately. I can't stand the thought of you being alone with those Jordan family bastards."

I patted her shoulder to reassure her. "Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. I have three kids to think about. I won't put myself in danger. I'm not stupid."

We discussed the possible scenarios for the next day and when she should come in to rescue me. We talked until midnight before I finally went to bed.

It was partly to ease my nerves about facing the Jordan family again. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to sleep at all.

I woke up early the next morning, despite only getting a few hours of sleep. I was still full of energy, a mix of excitement and nervousness.

I thought for a moment and pulled out a black dress from my closet.

I had thought about wearing something brighter, but Karen was dead. No matter what she had done, respecting the dead was important.

Besides, if I did wear something bright, the Jordan family might just kill me on the spot.

I asked Savannah to get me a bouquet of chrysanthemums.

I waited at home until noon before getting into her car and heading to Karen's funeral.

The entrance was adorned with large white flowers and black ribbons. None of the Jordan family members were outside. Instead, Leo was bustling around, acting as if the person inside was his own mother.

Since the Jordan family had fallen, no one wanted to associate with them, so there weren't many people at the funeral.

After all, who would want to be involved with a family that had no company or status?

So when I showed up with the chrysanthemums, I was the first guest.

Leo was surprised to see me. "Caroline, what are you doing here?"

I smiled and adjusted my sunglasses. "I thought about it. Karen and I were family for almost ten years. It wouldn't be right not to come."

"So I decided to bring some flowers to pay my respects."

Leo snapped out of his surprise and nodded, inviting me in.

Inside the hall, a few Jordan family members in black and some outsiders were present.

Everyone in Skyview City knew the Jordan family had gone bankrupt, but Brandon's poor relatives didn't. They were all here, trying to curry favor.

So it wasn't as empty as I had imagined.

As soon as I walked in, all eyes were on me. Brandon's relatives, who knew who I was, started to criticize me.

They didn't know Brandon and I were divorced.

"What's going on? Karen's funeral is today, and you're just now showing up?"

"In our hometown, you'd have been kicked out long ago."

"Get over here and help out instead of just standing there. If I were Brandon, I'd slap you."

One of the women, dressed plainly, glared at me.

I chuckled. "You want me to help?"

She glared back. "Who else? You think Brandon should do it? Get over here and help."

"So many guests, and you don't even think to serve tea or water. What are you thinking? Showing up so late."

"Brandon wasted his time on you."

At that moment, Brandon walked out of the bathroom and froze when he saw me.

"What are you doing here?"

His tone was hostile.

The woman misunderstood, thinking he was asking why I was late. She pointed at me with newfound confidence. "Brandon, this woman showed up so late, not respecting the Jordan family at all. You should divorce her."

"On such an important day, she doesn't even help serve tea or water. She has no sense."

Brandon glanced at the woman. "Shut up."

Then he looked at me coldly. "You're not welcome here. Leave. We're divorced."

The woman was stunned, looking at us in disbelief.

I chuckled and held up the flowers. "Karen and I lived together for almost ten years, and she's the grandmother of my three kids. I'm here to pay my respects on their behalf. What's wrong with that?"

###chapter 195

Brandon knew he couldn't argue back, so he gritted his teeth and said, "Then hurry up."

The more he tried to stop me, the more determined I was to defy him. I looked around.

I noticed a lot of people I hadn't seen before today, and I even spotted Irene's husband, Pax.

Maybe it was because Irene wasn't making money anymore, but her useless husband Pax seemed a lot more arrogant, pointing fingers at Irene.

The other relatives might not know, but Pax was well aware of the true nature of the Jordan family. He knew that without me, they were nothing.

So when he saw me, he immediately came over to ingratiate himself. "Hey, Ms. Sharp! What brings you here?"

I smiled slightly without saying a word, and Irene followed me in.

We exchanged a glance.

"I'm here to see Karen and bring flowers from my kids."

"You're so thoughtful. It's not easy for someone as busy as you to find time to visit Karen."

"If people hear about this, they'll surely say you're considerate and magnanimous."

He bowed and shook my hand, while Irene glared at me resentfully.

After all, my current life was what she once had, and she must be extremely bitter about it.

But the company's downfall was precisely because Irene embezzled a million dollars. Her resentment was useless.

I looked around but didn't see Renee or Earl.

Just then, Leo walked in from outside. I saw him and, ignoring Pax who was still flattering me, walked over to him. "Leo, where's Renee?"

"On such an important day, she and Earl should be here, right?"

Leo's eyes flickered, as if he was hiding something.

He cleared his throat. "They had things to do and couldn't make it. They already visited Mom earlier."

I was sure Leo was lying because Karen's body had been watched at the hospital. If they had visited secretly, the police would have known.

So he was just trying to hide it from me.

I chuckled lightly, not saying anything or exposing his lie.

At that moment, Brandon couldn't hold back any longer and pushed me. "After you lay the flowers, leave. Why are you still hanging around?"

When he tried to touch my arm, I lightly shrugged off his hand. "We've been married for so many years, and I can't stay a bit longer? Brandon, is your tolerance that low?"

"Or are you planning something that you don't want an outsider to hear?"

"The Jordan family has nothing to do with you anymore. If you're leaving, then leave now."

Brandon glared at me, gritting his teeth.

The more he tried to drive me away, the more certain I was that there was a secret, so I was even less likely to leave.

"What's the rush? I still have some words for Karen."

I stood in front of Karen's portrait.

Her sharp face, now in black and white, still looked harsh.

I looked at her and chuckled. "Who would have thought you'd die so suddenly?"

"I'll never forget how you treated me all these years."

"Before I married Brandon, you were so kind to me. You said you'd treat me like your own daughter. But after the wedding, what did you do?"

"You thought you could disregard me after getting my family's money, didn't you?"

Brandon's face darkened as he shouted, "Enough!"

"Caroline, leave now, or I'll make you."

I scoffed. "Do you dare? Have you paid back the million dollars? If you touch me today, I'll sue you immediately."

He didn't dare move, only glaring at me.

"After I had kids and the company was handed over to Brandon, you made things even harder for me. And worst of all, you dared to treat Brett that way."

"Did you ever think Brett is also your grandson, not just Jason?"

"Of course, your whole family has this despicable gene. How else could you favor the mistress's child and neglect your own grandson?"

"You brought a bunch of useless people into the company and ended up bankrupting it. I don't know how you still have the nerve to talk."

Irene finally couldn't stand it and pointed at me. "Caroline, you're being too harsh. I was your aunt, after all. How can you talk like that?"

I looked at her coldly. "I'm talking about you. Everyone here knows about your embezzlement."

"If it weren't for your greed, embezzling a million dollars for gambling, would we have ended up like this due to a cash flow crisis?"

"And where did your daily expenses come from? Do you think I don't know? Your salary wasn't that high. You took a bit here and there, didn't you?"

"The company wasn't your personal ATM."

Irene couldn't take it anymore and rolled up her sleeves, ready to hit me.

But I was no longer the weak Caroline. I easily dodged her slap.

"What are you doing? Trying to hit me?"

Irene gritted her teeth, her eyes red with anger. "So what if I hit you? I'm going to teach you a lesson for your parents."

"Who do you think you are?"

"Try touching me today, and see if I don't make the Jordan family lose everything."

Hearing this, she didn't dare move. Brandon also looked at me and said, "Caroline, have you said enough? If so, leave. You're not welcome here anymore."

A crowd had gathered around. I looked around and suddenly saw a tall figure at the back, head down, wearing a baseball cap, face obscured.

But from the height and build, I recognized Earl immediately.

I sneered. "I don't need your welcome. I'm here to find someone."

"Earl."

As soon as I said his name, several people changed their expressions. Brandon's eyes darted around. "Who are you talking about? Who's Earl?"

I pointed to the back of the crowd. "Isn't that him? You think I didn't see?"

"The one who killed Jason is you, Earl. Where do you think you can hide?"

"I'm telling you, Earl, you must pay for what you did to Jason."

###chapter 196

I warned coldly.

Earl suddenly ripped off his hat and mask, looking up at me. "So, you're not as dumb as you look. When did you figure me out?"

"I've known you'd be here for a while. After all, Karen's only ever truly cared about you over the years."

"In Karen's eyes, not even Brandon mattered as much as you. So, of course, you'd show up."

At this, Brandon shot a resentful glance at Earl.

I continued, "Since you're here, Renee must be around too. Come on out, no point hiding."

The crowd fell silent. I knew Renee was listening, so I pressed on.

"You think you can turn my company into the Jordan family's and use it for your dirty deeds? Renee, you're dead wrong. From the start, you made a huge mistake by kicking out my people and bringing in your Jordan family members. They're all useless."

"Honestly, if you'd kept the original team, the Jordan family would be swimming in money by now."

"If you had taken over the company yourself, it would have been the same. But you messed up by bringing in idiots like Earl and Irene."

Finally, a woman emerged from the corner, arms crossed, watching me with a seductive air.

Seeing her, I smirked. "I knew you were here. Was I wrong?"

"The biggest mistake was using Shirley and Paula."

"Shirley kicked your mother Karen in the stomach, and Paula is a two-faced snake. Who's Jason's real father?"

"This whole mess was stirred up by Paula. Without her, none of this would have happened. Jason wouldn't have died. She indirectly caused Jason's death and ruined the Jordan family."

"And you two still trust them."

"Then you let Earl, the fool, end up killing Jason."

I looked at Earl. "You'll pay for this, you know?"

Earl's face changed, and he looked at me warily. "Did you call the cops?"

I shook my head. "No way. I'm just here to pay my respects to Karen. She had so many kids, but not one of them turned out smart."

I placed the flowers in front of her photo.

As I turned to leave the funeral parlor, a few people blocked my way.

Renee sneered at me. "Caroline, your speech was impressive, but do you think you can just walk out of here?"

"Why not? I got out of a ten-year marriage, and soon the company will be back in my hands. You think I can't leave a small funeral parlor? Dream on, Renee."

Brandon looked stunned but quickly recovered. "What do you mean? The company will be yours?"

I smiled at him. "Exactly what I said."

"Brandon, you idiot, haven't you figured it out yet?"

I turned and walked out confidently, ignoring the tall men blocking my path.

"Stop! Don't go! Explain yourself!"

Brandon was completely unhinged, his eyes red as he screamed at me.

I ignored him. Just then, Savannah burst in from outside, kicking the men to the ground.

These guys looked tough but were all bark and no bite. Savannah took them down easily, leaving them groaning on the floor, unable to fight back.

I scoffed. "The people you hire are just as useless as you."

With that, Savannah led me out. I didn't care about the Jordan family's reaction.

I was about to head home when I got a call from Holly.

"Ms. Sharp, come back quickly! Aria is missing!"

A chill ran through me, and I rushed home with Savannah.

When I got home, Holly was on the couch, holding a crying Yves. She stood up as soon as she saw me. "Ms. Sharp, it's all my fault. I was outside with Aria, and Yves was napping. Suddenly, a group of masked people came in. They pushed me down and took Aria. I couldn't see their faces, and the license plate was covered."

Seeing her panic, I felt terrible but tried to comfort her.

"It's okay. Leave it to me. Just take care of Yves."

I called Simon. "Simon, do you have anyone available? Aria's been kidnapped."

"What?"

"Hang on, I'll send people over. We'll check the surveillance footage first."

I nodded, feeling frantic. I couldn't help but think of Jason's fate. I couldn't bear the thought of my child suffering the same.

Who would dare to kidnap my child in broad daylight? I thought about the people at the funeral. They didn't seem like they had planned this.

Then it hit me-Shirley and Paula. It had to be one of them.

Their reputation in the Jordan family was shaky, so they needed to prove themselves.

But Aria is Brandon's child. No matter what, he wouldn't let them kidnap his own kid. This must be a move to show loyalty to Earl or Renee.

I gritted my teeth and called Royce.

We hadn't spoken in a while, but this wasn't the time for awkwardness. I was on the verge of tears. "Royce, Aria is missing. Help me."

He responded quickly. "I'm on my way. Hang tight."

I couldn't sit still in the living room. Savannah checked the nearby surveillance but found nothing. Soon, Simon and Royce arrived with their teams.

I had Holly explain what happened.

Simon frowned. "This is outrageous, kidnapping a child in broad daylight."

"But don't worry, they won't harm the child."

Meanwhile, Yves started crying loudly, sensing something was wrong. His cries made me even more anxious and upset.

I had a bad feeling I couldn't shake.

Royce put his arm around my shoulders, gently patting me. "Don't worry, we'll handle this."

###chapter 197

With Royce's comforting words, I gradually calmed down. I said, "I think it was either Shirley or Paula who did this."

"Please, keep a close eye on those two. They're definitely involved."

Simon nodded and made a call. "Don't worry, I'll get our people to track their phone locations right now."

"As soon as they show up, our team will track them down immediately."

I nodded, feeling restless as I sat on the couch. Even though I knew I shouldn't dwell on these thoughts, I couldn't help but worry about Jason's fate.

Royce seemed to notice my anxiety and sat beside me, wrapping his arm around my shoulder. I couldn't hold back any longer and burst into tears in his embrace.

"I can't bear the thought of my child ending up like Jason. Please, you have to help me find him. I'll do anything, just please help me find my child."

Royce held me close and whispered, "Don't worry, the kid will be fine. Trust us, okay?"

Soon, Simon returned with footage from the neighborhood's exit. "We've confirmed that Shirley took your child. She's in the passenger seat, and you won't believe who the driver is."

I looked at him, stunned. "Who is it?"

"It's James. The two of them are together again, driving the car."

"Our system is tracking their vehicle, and it looks like they're heading out of town, trying to take the child away."

My legs gave out, and I collapsed onto the couch, feeling utterly lost. "Where are they taking my child? Why are they leaving town?"

Simon gritted his teeth and said, "Don't worry, Savannah and I will head over there right now. We'll bring your child back safely."

Savannah nodded. With limited manpower, she had to go help. She gave me a worried look before rushing out.

Now, it was just Royce and me.

Holly, looking guilty, said, "It's all my fault. If I hadn't insisted on taking the child outside, this wouldn't have happened. They wouldn't have dared to come into the house to snatch him. It's all my fault."

Despite my anxiety, I tried to comfort her. "Holly, don't blame yourself. This has nothing to do with you. Shirley and the others had planned this for a long time. They were determined to take my child."

"They would have found a way no matter what. Even if the child was with me, they would have taken him. Don't blame yourself. The most important thing now is to work together to bring the child back as soon as possible."

Holly nodded vigorously. "But what can I do to help?"

I patted her shoulder. "Taking care of Yves is your most important task right now. If you take good care of Yves, we can focus on finding Aria."

She nodded quickly. "I'll go check on Yves right now. I won't let anyone take him."

She bit her lip and went into the nursery.

After using the last bit of my strength to comfort Holly, I collapsed on the couch. Royce held me and said, "Don't push yourself too hard. Everything will be okay. Shirley wouldn't dare harm your child. Remember, she raised Yves and Aria."

I nodded, realizing Royce was right. Shirley had a strong attachment to Yves and Aria. She wouldn't hurt Aria.

Feeling a bit better, I said, "I will make sure Shirley ends up in prison. She won't get away with this."

Royce whispered in my ear, "Don't worry, I'll help you."

We sat on the couch until midnight, my anxiety growing with each passing minute.

Just then, Simon called, his voice somber.

I knew something bad had happened. "What is it? Tell me."

"I'm sorry, Caroline. We lost them. James and Shirley have likely left Skyview City."

My head buzzed, and I couldn't hear anything else. The phone slipped from my hand as I collapsed.

"Why? Why are they taking my child?"

"Caroline, don't worry. We've set up roadblocks. We'll catch them."

"Unless they grow wings and fly, we'll find them. Trust us."

"Also, I noticed another group tracking Shirley. I'm not sure if it's Brandon's or Renee's people, but it's likely one of them."

"We need to find Shirley before they do. If the child falls into their hands..."

Whether it was Brandon or Renee, it would be a disaster for me.

If Brandon found the child first, he would use Aria to threaten me, making outrageous demands that I would have to comply with.

As for Renee, I couldn't even imagine the consequences. Renee was cold and ruthless, with no sense of family. Aria would be in grave danger with her.

"Don't worry, Caroline. We're monitoring them closely. We'll intervene if necessary."

I nodded and thanked him.

Just then, I received a call from Leo.

He seemed unaware that Aria was missing. "Caroline, is it true that Jason was killed by Earl?"

I responded affirmatively.

"I know where Earl is. He's with Renee. If you want to catch him, now's your chance."

"Really, believe me. I'm not lying. I lied before because Renee threatened to send Briar abroad if I talked."

###chapter 198

I was a bit surprised that Leo would tell me Renee's location without hesitation.

In my mind, Leo had always loved Renee deeply, so it didn't make sense for him to suddenly betray her.

But then I remembered what he said about Renee being willing to send her own daughter, Briar, abroad. It made me realize that he had his reasons.

After all, if she could send her own daughter, such a sweet little girl, abroad to suffer, it showed that she had no familial love left in her heart and didn't care about Briar at all.

So, Leo's actions were understandable.

I cleared my throat and said, "Leo, where they went has nothing to do with me. I just want to stay away from them. Now, Aria has been taken by someone, and I really don't have time to deal with this. Please understand."

Leo was stunned. "How could that be? Isn't the child in Suncrest City?"

"She came back for a vaccine, but then some people took her."

My voice was low. "But don't worry, Leo. Briar didn't come back. She's very safe in Suncrest City, and there are people watching over her."

"Caroline, that's not what I meant. Since Aria is missing, you should go find her. If you need any help, just let me know."

"Don't worry, I'll do everything I can to help you because you truly care about Briar."

After thanking him, I hung up the phone.

Of course, I wasn't going to ignore the situation with Renee and Earl.

I took a moment to call Simon.

He's been busy helping me find Aria while also dealing with Renee and Earl, so this address would definitely be a big help.

"Simon, Leo just told me where Earl and Renee are hiding. You should send your team to check it out. You might find something."

After giving Simon the address, he quickly nodded. "Okay, I'll arrange for someone to go right away."

"Caroline, don't be too upset. We're doing everything we can to find her. I'm sure we'll bring Aria back to you safely."

I nodded. I had complete faith in Simon and his team's abilities.

I spent the whole day anxiously waiting in the house, with Royce by my side the entire time. I couldn't help but nudge him.

He looked just as exhausted, with dark circles under his eyes and stubble on his chin.

"Royce, you should get some sleep. Don't stay up with me."

"This isn't even your problem. It's my fault for dragging you into this. Please, go rest. I feel really bad about this."

He shook his head. "It's fine. I had some things to do today anyway, so I don't need to sleep."

"I need to step out for a bit. The company audit is in its final stages, and I need to be there to oversee the handover. I can't trust anyone else with it."

"Don't worry, I'll be back soon."

He seemed worried about leaving me alone, speaking gently.

###chapter 199

I was a bit stunned; I hadn't expected the company's bankruptcy and liquidation to proceed so quickly.

But he said, "I can't wait any longer. Brandon and his family need to face justice as soon as possible."

I nodded, "You're right, this is important. Go ahead and take care of it. Don't worry about things here, I've got it under control. I won't let anything happen."

After Royce left, I suddenly received a call from Kelly. She was probably calling to ask about Yves and Aria getting their vaccines.

A bitter smile appeared on my face. Kelly still didn't know that Aria had gone missing. If she found out, she would be even more worried, so I couldn't tell her.

I declined her video call and called her back instead.

"What's going on? Why didn't you answer my video call? I wanted to see the kids."

I chuckled lightly, "I must have hit the wrong button. They're not home right now, nothing to see."

"Why aren't they home?"

"Holly and Savannah took them out to play. I finally get a moment to relax at home, and then you call."

I tried to sound casual, but in reality, I couldn't even muster a smile.

"You're always slacking off. Why don't you help Holly and Savannah?"

"Let's not talk about that. How did the kids do with their shots? Did they cry?"

"They cried, really loudly. We had to bribe them with candy to cheer them up. But don't worry, after the shots, we'll bring them back in a few days."

"Flying back and forth isn't great for their ears, so I don't want them to fly too often. We'll wait a couple of days before bringing them back."

Kelly nodded, "You're always so thoughtful. Just make sure to video call me and the kids tonight. I can't go a day without seeing them."

I ran my hand back and forth on the couch, feeling anxious but trying not to show it. "Got it. I have to go now, talk later."

After hanging up, I sighed. I didn't want to lie to Kelly, but I had no other choice right now.

Before Royce left, he promised me that Aria would be found within a week.

For some reason, I had an inexplicable faith in his words. I believed that no matter what, Aria would come back.

That afternoon, Simon and Savannah returned. After days of traveling, they both looked exhausted.

They were a mess, so I quickly bought a bunch of food for them, feeling guilty inside.

"I'm really sorry for making you both go through this. You haven't been able to eat or sleep properly."

Savannah waved it off, saying it was no big deal. Simon shook his head, "This is nothing. Isn't this what we're supposed to do? A child has been kidnapped. It doesn't matter whose child it is, we need to find them. So, Caroline, don't feel guilty. This is our duty."

Simon was devouring his food when he suddenly remembered something and said, "Oh, Caroline, about that address you gave me this morning. I had my colleagues check it out. Only Earl and Renee were there."

"Paula wasn't there. She probably took advantage of the chaos to escape. Otherwise, with her current situation, she would definitely stick close to Earl and Renee."

He took a sip of water and swallowed the food in his mouth. "But don't worry, Caroline. I've already sent people to track Paula down. We're keeping a close watch on Renee and Earl. They won't get away."

###chapter 200

I thought back carefully to Paula's behavior before. She wouldn't just disappear without a reason.

Paula was a self-serving person. Unless Renee posed some kind of threat to her, she wouldn't leave Renee, or she might have found something more useful.

From what I knew about Paula, she might have discovered that Shirley had taken my child and tracked her down.

If we could find Paula, we could find Shirley and my child.

After I shared my theory, everyone nodded in agreement. I wanted to call Paula to test the waters, but Simon stopped me.

"Don't get too excited, Caroline. We need to plan this carefully. Calling her now might alert her."

I nodded, realizing he was right.

For now, we could only wait and see.

After Royce and Savannah finished eating, they took a nap on the couch. They didn't sleep for long before getting up again.

Simon was on the phone, saying, "We've sent out the child's description. Make sure to check any vehicles where you can't see the back seats, especially vans and small trucks."

"But don't overlook regular family cars either. The child could be disguised as a normal kid in the back seat."

"Pay special attention to a mole on the child's neck."

He gave his instructions.

I watched him anxiously, hoping he would bring some good news, but deep down, I knew it was unlikely.

Shirley had been very cunning this time. Finding my child would be a challenge.

Still, I held onto hope, thinking about what Royce had told me about something happening within a week. It was like a reassurance, making me believe my child would come back to me.

We made it through another night. It had been thirty-six hours since my child went missing.

I hadn't slept for thirty-six hours, but I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Aria crying for her mom.

I tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. When I went downstairs, Simon and Savannah were still comparing surveillance videos, trying to find my child. I felt a wave of sadness.

I knew I should tell them to rest, but I selfishly hoped they would keep searching until they found my child. I knew it was selfish, but any mother would feel the same in this situation.

Just then, Simon shouted, "We have a video of the child!"

I rushed over, stunned. Simon looked at me and asked, "Caroline, why aren't you sleeping? You've been up for so long. You need to rest."

I shook my head. "You haven't slept either. How can I, as a mother, sleep? It's okay, just show me the video."

Simon nodded and pressed the space bar to play the video on the computer.

The video showed an unknown town, and Shirley was holding Aria.

The footage was a bit blurry, but I recognized Aria immediately. Shirley was looking at her with a loving expression, playing with a toy to make her laugh.

Aria was laughing heartily.

Then, James, a tall and strong man, walked over, handing Shirley a train ticket.

They seemed to be discussing something, and then Shirley took the ticket and boarded the train.

I watched Shirley and Aria intently until the video ended, staring at the dark screen.

Savannah said to me, "Caroline, don't worry. It looks like Shirley took the child back to her hometown. I recognized the train station name as being near her hometown."

###chapter 201

"And with Shirley's attitude towards the kid just now, there's no way she'd hurt Aria. So, try to relax and get some sleep. With the location and the video, it's just a matter of time before we find her."

I couldn't hold back anymore and started crying, covering my mouth.

Thank goodness for the video of Aria, letting me see her one more time.

The long hours of sleepless nights and the mental strain had nearly broken me. If it weren't for the timely appearance of this video, giving me some comfort, I might have already fainted.

Exhausted from crying, Savannah helped me upstairs.

"Caroline, you need to get some sleep. We all need rest, or we won't have the energy to keep looking for Aria."

I nodded. "Tell Simon to sleep in the guest room. He really needs the rest. If I remember right, none of you have slept in a long time."

Savannah nodded. "Don't worry, I'll talk to him."

I tossed and turned in bed, thinking about the image of Aria giggling in Shirley's arms.

She's so small, so unaware of everything.

She doesn't even know that she's now in Shirley's arms, far away from me.

No matter what, I have to find my Aria as soon as possible. I can't let her stay with Shirley.

Due to the long hours of exhaustion, I quickly fell asleep, but it was a restless sleep.

I kept thinking about my child.

I even dreamed of her, imagining her not eating well, not sleeping well, crying and calling out for mommy because she was hungry.

I woke up with a start at dawn. I glanced at the clock and realized I had slept for ten hours. My body must have been at its limit.

I got out of bed and saw Savannah and Simon still sitting on the couch, in the same positions as last night, but their expressions were much more relaxed. It seemed they had slept too.

Downstairs, Savannah handed me breakfast. "Caroline, eat up. Mr. Castillo brought this breakfast earlier."

I was taken aback and looked around. "When did Royce come? Where is he now?"

"Mr. Castillo has been working harder than any of us. He hasn't slept for days. He came back from the office this morning and brought breakfast. Simon and I convinced him to sleep in the guest room."

I nodded. Royce really was the most exhausted among us, juggling both the company's issues and the child's situation.

This matter had nothing to do with him, but at this moment, I couldn't bring myself to refuse his help.

I pushed open the door to Royce's guest room. He was lying on the bed, still in his wrinkled suit, but it didn't diminish his air of elegance.

His eyes were closed, and his eyelashes fluttered slightly.

Sensing my presence, he opened his eyes and looked at me, his gaze sharp.

Seeing it was me, he relaxed instantly. "It's you. Did you sleep well?"

###chapter 202

I nodded, "I just wanted to check on you. You're working too hard. Take off your jacket."

Royce shook his head, "Nah, it's better if I keep it on in case something comes up."

I stepped forward and started to take off his suit jacket.

"Didn't you always tell me that nothing is more important than health?"

Royce paused for a moment, then let me continue. After I took off his jacket, I grabbed a blanket from the closet.

I pulled the curtains tight, blocking out all the light from outside.

The room plunged into darkness, but to my surprise, I could still see Royce's eyes.

I told him, "Get some good sleep, Royce."

He looked at me with concern, "Don't worry, I'll do everything I can to find the kid. I know where Paula and Shirley's hometown is, and I've already sent people to check it out."

I shook my head and put a finger to his lips, "No more talking, just sleep."

I gently pushed him onto the bed and covered him with the blanket.

Royce must have been exhausted because he quickly fell into a deep sleep. Once he was out, I quietly left the room and closed the door softly behind me.

Simon looked at me and asked, "Is Royce asleep?"

I nodded, "Let him rest. I want to go to Shirley's hometown myself."

But Simon frowned and disagreed, "I don't think that's a good idea. If Shirley sees you, she might get emotional and do something to Aria."

"The best plan is for people who Shirley doesn't know to go."

"And you're not in the best shape for a long trip. It's better if you stay home and wait for news," Savannah added, siding with Simon.

I couldn't argue with them, so I nodded and let Savannah and Simon prepare to leave that night.

When Royce woke up, I told him about the plan. He nodded, "I get it. My team is already set up over there and will support Simon and Savannah."

Royce stayed behind to handle the company's bankruptcy proceedings and kept a close watch on any updates, promising to inform me immediately if anything came up.

I spent the next two days anxiously waiting. It had been seventy-two hours since Aria went missing, and I couldn't sleep at night.

Royce had to use some tough love to keep me in the room so I could get some rest.

Finally, we got good news. Simon told me they had spotted Paula in Shirley's hometown.

I felt a surge of excitement. This confirmed my suspicion that Paula was after Shirley.

Paula hated Shirley so much that she wouldn't let her off easily. The two of them were likely to clash, and if we followed Paula, Shirley wouldn't be able to escape.

Simon said, "We've managed to get access to Paula's phone and installed tracking and monitoring software. As soon as she contacts Shirley, we'll know the kid's exact location and whether Paula is working for EarlRenee."

I nodded eagerly, "That's great. With you guys on this, I feel much more at ease."

###chapter 203

"Ever since I kicked Shirley out of Brandon's house, Paula's been MIA. Looks like she went to crash with Earl and Renee. They must've given her a place to stay."

"As for when they got involved, it was probably after Paula joined the company. She bumped into Earl by chance and eventually ended up with Renee."

Simon chimed in, "Actually, Paula's the smart one. She figured out Brandon was just a puppet. The real power in the Jordan family is Renee."

"That's why she ditched Brandon and went to Renee."

I nodded, "Exactly. Paula's tight with her parents, unlike Shirley. Shirley probably won't go back home, but Paula might. So if you can't find her, stake out near her parents' place. You'll definitely spot her."

Suddenly, an idea hit me. "Oh, and James lives in that area too. You should send someone to watch his house. If you find James, you'll find Shirley."

Simon quickly nodded, "Right, I almost forgot about him. I'll send someone right away."

After hanging up, I let out a deep breath and looked at Royce. "Maybe we'll have results soon."

He nodded.

That evening, Simon called with good news. "You were right. James is back home. We're keeping an eye on him."

But there was also bad news. "Renee has sent people over. They might be trying to take the child."

"If Aria ends up with Renee, it'll be too late."

A sense of dread filled me. "I need to go there now."

Those people are ruthless. They might harm my child. I can't just sit here. I have to go.

Royce stopped me. "Don't worry. We've set up tight surveillance. We'll get the child back. You should stay home and wait for news. You're not well."

I shook my head firmly. "I know my own body. I can handle it. If I stay here doing nothing, the anxiety will kill me."

"Royce, trust my instincts. If something's going to happen, I need to be there. Please, let me go."

Royce frowned, thinking for a long time. "Give me ten minutes. I'll get back to you."

I nodded. Just then, my phone rang, the shrill sound startling everyone.

I quickly answered. It was Paula, who I hadn't heard from in ages.

She greeted me with a sweet, almost mocking tone. "Long time no see, Ms. Sharp."

Hearing her voice made my hair stand on end, like a mammal sensing a predator. I listened, every nerve on high alert.

###chapter 204

"Paula, why are you calling me?"

Paula chuckled softly. "Ms. Sharp, I know you're mad at me right now. I mean, the whole Kathy thing was kinda my fault."

I let out a cold laugh. "Just the Kathy thing?"

"Yeah, and Jason too. Almost forgot about that. But honestly, that wasn't really on me."

She sighed on the other end. "Forget it. I'll explain everything when we meet. It's not convenient to talk here."

I frowned. "Paula, have you ever thought that when you first came to my house, I genuinely wanted to help you? Later, when you pledged your loyalty to me, I trusted you. But you kept doing these things..."

Her tone remained emotionless. "I know. There's nothing I can do to make it up to you. How about this? Come to my hometown. You know the address, right?"

"Just come. Trust me, I have a surprise for you. Besides Renee's people, Brandon is also on his way here. My hometown is rarely this lively. Aren't you curious to join the fun?"

After hanging up, I frowned deeply. "What does she mean by this?"

Royce shook his head. "Not sure, but it might be a provocation. I still think you should be cautious about going there. It could be dangerous."

I shook my head firmly. "No matter what, I have to go. Right now, it seems more dangerous not to go."

Royce frowned at me for a long time before sighing in resignation. "Alright, I'll go with you."

I wanted him to stay, but he insisted on coming. After a long discussion, I finally agreed.

I packed a couple of clothes and asked Holly to keep a close eye on Yves.

Holly nodded. "Ms. Sharp, don't worry. Once you leave, I'll take the kid to my nephew's place. He's a cop. I doubt anyone would dare to come after the kid there."

With that, I felt relieved and thanked Holly.

Royce and I then set off for Shirley and Paula's hometown, Silverpeak City.

When we landed, Savannah was there to pick us up.

She said, "There's no airport near their hometown. It's over 200 miles from here. You must be exhausted from the trip. Rest in the backseat, and I'll drive you there."

"We've booked a hotel near their place. It's very secure, so you can relax."

Simon and Savannah were always reliable, so I felt at ease as Royce and I headed to Silverpeak City.

The air here had a hazy quality, likely from the constant wind and dust. Skyview City, being by the sea, had exceptionally fresh air, but this place had a rugged charm.

Two completely different cities, two different worlds.

After we arrived at the hotel, I changed into another outfit.

Since coming here, I was prepared for any danger. I packed only pants. I put on a pair of tight jeans and a white T-shirt, looking almost like a college student.

I told Royce, Savannah, and Simon, "I can't stay put. I'm going out to look around."

Deep down, I still held a sliver of hope. What if I stepped out and saw Shirley holding my child?

###chapter 205

Of course, all of this was just wishful thinking. I knew it was impossible. If Shirley wanted to hide my child, she'd definitely find a secure place, not just bring them out onto the street.

Savannah turned to me, "I'll go with you. Even though we might not run into Shirley and her people on the street, Renee's folks are still around, and James is out there too. It's kinda risky."

With Savannah tagging along, I felt less burdened. I nodded, and we both left the hotel and headed out onto the street.

This place wasn't much different from other cities, with a few tall buildings and street vendors everywhere selling local food and goods.

We were looking around when Savannah suddenly grabbed my arm and pointed ahead. "Caroline, look over there. Isn't that James? He looks familiar."

I followed her gaze and, to my surprise, it really was James. I never expected to get such a lucky break.

I quickly grabbed Savannah and started to follow James.

Savannah hesitated, holding me back. "We promised Mr. Castillo we wouldn't go too far, and even if we did see someone, we shouldn't follow them. Isn't this a bad idea?"

I replied, "We can't miss this chance. If you want to go back, you can, but I'm following him."

Savannah couldn't argue with me and had no choice but to come along. We trailed James through the streets.

Locals definitely had an advantage here. He moved quickly, and the paths were tricky, making it hard for us to keep up.

Luckily, James was tall and broad, making him easy to spot in the crowd. We managed to keep up by looking for his distinctive features.

We followed him into an old, run-down neighborhood.

The place looked like it had seen better days, with peeling paint on the walls.

Some of the buildings were empty, with faded "For Rent" and "For Sale" signs hanging on them. The landlords probably knew no one would rent or buy these places, so the signs had been up for ages.

Just as we were about to continue following James, two people suddenly blocked our way.

Savannah recognized one of them and said, "Aren't you one of Simon's guys?"

The man nodded. "Yeah, Mr. Lawson sent us to keep an eye on this place. This is James' father's house."

Savannah and I exchanged a surprised look. We hadn't expected to find him here instead of heading to Shirley's place.

"You two should head back. If he goes to Shirley's, we'll have someone follow him. You being here might alert him," the man said.

Knowing someone was already watching the place, Savannah and I felt relieved and headed back to the hotel.

We didn't just sit around at the hotel, though. Simon had eyes all over town, so we quickly learned the movements of everyone except Shirley and the child.

Paula was staying at her parents' house, and James was moving between his own place and his father's house.

###chapter 206

Meanwhile, Royce's team had tracked down the people sent by Brandon and Renee.

Brandon had already arrived and was staying at a hotel. He might come over tomorrow.

Renee's people had reached Silverpeak City and were preparing to find Shirley. As soon as she appeared, they planned to snatch the child away immediately.

Simon had installed surveillance software on Paula's phone, which had inadvertently recorded a conversation between her and Shirley.

We were all sitting on a bed, listening to the recording. Paula taunted Shirley, "Shirley, you're back, but you didn't come to see Mom and Dad? That's pretty ungrateful of you."

"You should come home."

Shirley scoffed, "Paula, if you have something to say, just say it. No need to beat around the bush."

Paula chuckled lightly, her tone calm, "I just wanted to persuade you to come home. Why are you so hostile?"

"Mom and Dad made your favorite dishes, waiting for you to come back."

"Or are you afraid to come back because of me?"

Shirley finally snapped, "Paula, will you ever stop? Even if I wronged you back then, the money I've given you over the years should have made up for it. Why are you still holding onto this?"

"How dare you say that? When I was in college, how much did you give me? Just some tuition and basic living expenses. You give James twenty thousand dollars a month, but only a little over a thousand to me."

"If it weren't for my own efforts to find you, you'd still be living a comfortable life."

"Paula, what do you want? Don't think that just because you're with Renee, it means anything. Renee's money is dirty, and she'll be brought to justice sooner or later."

"You think helping her will get you anything? You'll end up in jail with her."

"She can kill you before she goes down, like squashing an ant. That's why I'm with Renee."

"You should come back and see Mom and Dad. They've aged a lot over the years."

Shirley scoffed, "What does it matter to me if they die? I've cut ties with them long ago."

"Really? You're so heartless, Shirley."

"Oh, and I told Brandon about you."

"He's probably almost in Silverpeak City by now."

"After all, you killed his child Jason, and now you want to take Aria. Do you think he'll let you? He's probably coming to kill you."

Paula's light laughter as she said these terrifying words sent chills down our spines.

Savannah smirked, "These two really have a love-hate relationship."

The recording continued. Shirley roared, "Paula, are you crazy? How could you tell Brandon?!"

"I'm crazy because of you. Now you'll see how crazy I can be."

"By the way, Renee is also looking for you. If you don't show up, you better hide well. If we find you, you're done for."

The conversation ended, and we exchanged glances. "Do you think Shirley will go back?"

Savannah shook her head, "We don't know why Paula wants Shirley to go back."

"Is it just to see their parents?"

I shook my head, knowing the history between Shirley and Paula. "No way. Paula hates Shirley to the core. She wants her to show up so she can kill her. There's no other reason. Their endgame is a fight to the death."

"Shirley is also afraid of Renee's people. Even though she knows Paula's scheme, she has to go back because she's afraid Renee will take the child."

"But Paula doesn't care about that. She just wants Shirley to show up."

"So we have to intercept Shirley before Renee's people find her and take the child. Otherwise, something bad will happen."

"Brandon is useless. He can't get anything done."

Simon said, "Let's station people outside Shirley's parents' place. As soon as Shirley shows up, we'll intercept her."

That night, we got word that Shirley had been spotted outside her parents' place, but she didn't have the child with her.

And there was no sign of the child with James either, so she must have hidden the child somewhere only she or James knew about.

I gritted my teeth, not expecting Shirley to be so cunning. "Don't grab Shirley yet. It'll be harder to find the child if we do."

"If we can't find the child, neither can Renee's people. Let Shirley go."

Simon said, "Send a drone to monitor Shirley's parents' place. We need real-time updates."

Soon, we received video footage from the drone, showing Shirley and Paula's family window.

Luckily, the window was open, and we could hear the conversation inside.

Shirley seemed to be arguing with her parents, her voice hysterical and on the verge of breaking down.

Paula sat nearby, legs crossed, watching the scene unfold like a spectator.

"Shirley, you haven't been back in years, and now you're arguing with Mom? That's too much."

Shirley glared at Paula, "You bitch, why didn't I have James kill you back then? Letting you live was my biggest mistake."

"If it weren't for you, things wouldn't have turned out this way. Maybe Caroline wouldn't have found out about me and Brandon. She might be dead by now. It's all your fault."

"Paula, you're a waste of space. Why don't you just die?"

Paula crossed her arms and laughed coldly, "Shirley, I'll die after you. How could I die before you?"

Their mother sobbed on the floor, "Is this still a family? You come back and start fighting. What do you want?"

"Paula, you've made so much money over the years. Why didn't you ever send any to me and Paula?"

###chapter 207

Shirley glared at her mother, seething. "I've been giving you money all these years, and how have you treated me?"

"You've been abusing me since I was a kid, and now you expect me to keep giving you money? How shameless can you be?"

Her mother, Pamelia, snapped back, "Didn't we raise you? You think you grew up healthy and strong by eating air?"

"If it weren't for your father and me, you wouldn't be here. You're so ungrateful."

"If I had known you'd turn out this way, I would have drowned you in the river when you were little."

Shirley stared at her with a cold expression. "You should have drowned me back then, so I wouldn't have to deal with you now."

Paula crossed her arms and smirked. "Shirley, that's not how it works."

"How your parents treated you has nothing to do with me. Why take it out on me? What did I do wrong? I always treated you like a real sister, but you let James treat me like that."

Shirley sneered at Paula. "Because you were always their favorite. They took you to the city and left me in the countryside."

"They left me alone in this rural place, and when you came back, you were dressed like a princess. Where did that leave me?"

"So I decided to destroy their favorite. How does that feel?"

"I only regret not doing more. Why didn't I have James strangle you?"

Shirley's eyes were filled with malice as she glared at Paula.

Paula's eyes reddened with anger, but she smiled softly. "You're such a good sister. But don't worry, I'll repay you a hundredfold for everything you've done to me."

"Do you know why I brought Renee here?"

"Because Renee promised to kill you for me."

"She promised to kill James and everyone who ever bullied me."

"I once believed in Caroline, hoping she'd help me get revenge. But even after her husband was taken, she was still soft-hearted towards you. So I knew I couldn't rely on Caroline. I needed someone stronger."

Watching Paula's cold expression on the screen, I finally understood why she betrayed me.

Maybe Paula was sincere when she first came to me, but I never wanted to hurt anyone.

So Paula's path was inevitable.

Shirley's face changed color as she glared at Paula. "Did you really tell Renee?"

Paula laughed coldly, her smile wild. "Of course I did. Did you think I'd let you off so easily, Shirley?"

Fear flashed across Shirley's face as she looked around, wary of anyone approaching. Deep down, she was still afraid of Renee.

She had seen Renee's methods and was terrified of her.

At that moment, Pamelia burst into laughter. "Shirley, you're scared? If you take care of our family's retirement money, maybe I'll convince Paula to leave you alone."

Shirley shot Pamelia a vicious look. "I'll give you money over my dead body."

Just then, the door swung open, and a drunken man stumbled in.

He saw the scene and laughed. "Who's here? My daughter is back."

His voice was disgusting and lecherous, making everyone frown.

Shirley felt a wave of nausea and turned to vomit.

I watched with a frown, realizing that Shirley's reaction to this man was far from normal.

Sure enough, the man stepped forward and touched Shirley's hand. "My daughter's hand is so soft. Let me feel it."

He grabbed her hand and tried to move it towards himself.

We all stared in shock, and Shirley kicked the man, sending him sprawling to the floor.

"Go to hell, you bastard. I can't believe you're still alive."

The man got up, glaring at Shirley. "What's wrong with letting your father touch you?"

"Don't make me angry. Get on your knees."

Shirley glared at the man and Pamelia, her eyes filled with rage.

"Fuck."

"When I left home, I swore I'd never come back. If I did, it would be to curse you out."

"You're a monster. When you came to take me back home, I thought I'd have a happy life. But you trapped me."

"You threatened me, raped me, made my life a living hell. I hate you forever."

The man stood unsteadily, glaring at Shirley. "So what? I was just testing you for your future husband, so you wouldn't go around seducing men."

Shirley spat in his face. "Because I wouldn't let you touch me, you threw me out in the dead of winter, ruining my body. The doctor said I'll never have children."

"You destroyed my life, do you understand?"

I was stunned, finally understanding why Shirley was so possessive of my child.

She couldn't have her own, but she wanted a child with Brandon. The only way was to steal mine.

She's a pitiful person, but I couldn't bring myself to feel sorry for her.

The man said nothing, and Shirley turned her gaze to Pamelia.

"I've suffered for years because of him, and you pretended to be deaf and blind. Now you're neither?"

"As my mother, you couldn't even say a word for me. You always took Paula to stay with relatives, leaving me here."

"Are you even human? You ruined your own daughter. Are you human?"

Pamelia, knowing she was in the wrong, said nothing and glared at her. "So what? We're still your parents. Try disrespecting us."

Shirley scoffed. "You think you deserve my respect?"

"Go to hell, all of you."

Paula sat nearby, emotionless, until Shirley finished. Then she slowly clapped.

"They ruined your life, but you ruined mine. So you're just as much of a monster as they are."

###chapter 208

"Don't think you can just say a few words and take the moral high ground to condemn me. I'm telling you, it's not going to happen."

"Shirley, you deserve this."

Shirley turned her attention to Paula. "Oh, I haven't even started on you yet, you jerk."

"I did it on purpose, so what? I want to ruin your life, so what?"

"Why do our awful parents only target me and treat you like a princess?"

"Every time you talk to me, you act so superior. What gives you the right? Do you deserve it?"

"I want to destroy you!"

Shirley burst into maniacal laughter, her face twisted with a sinister smile.

"I want you to struggle in the mud just like me, unable to get up. Everything I've been through, I want you to experience it too. I want you to know exactly how I feel inside."

Her laughter grew louder, echoing through the room and the video.

Paula looked at Shirley coldly. "What are you so proud of?"

"Shirley, don't think I don't know what you're thinking."

"Isn't it just because Brandon promised you something? Otherwise, you wouldn't have dared to steal that child and run here."

"Let me guess, did he promise to take you abroad after everything was over, and you two would live happily ever after with the child?"

Shirley's face changed instantly. She glared at Paula. "How do you know?"

The arrogance she had just displayed vanished in an instant.

Paula smiled lightly. "You can ask Brandon how I know. He made the same promise to me."

"Brandon is just a scumbag who deceives women, and you were foolish enough to believe him, my dear sister."

"Now that Brandon is on his way, do you think he's coming to happily take you and the child abroad, or to angrily take the child back?"

Paula's words hit Shirley's last line of defense, causing her to completely break down.

She started screaming in the room, "No, no, Brandon said he would take me abroad. It's impossible!"

"Stop dreaming, Shirley."

"Brandon only cares about money. He doesn't care about you."

"And the most important thing is, he doesn't dare take you abroad, or any woman for that matter, because that person is abroad. Do you think he can explain it if he takes you away?"

That person?

I silently pondered Paula's words.

From what Paula said, this unknown person seemed to hold a higher position than Brandon.

Otherwise, Brandon, who dared to cheat right under my nose, wouldn't be so afraid.

So who is that person?

I suddenly remembered the foreign IP address that was always pinned at the top of his phone, with an avatar of a red spider lily.

Could it be her?

Shirley froze, as if she had just thought of this, and immediately broke down.

"No, no! I don't believe it!"

"Whether you believe it or not, it's the truth. You can ask Brandon yourself when he arrives tomorrow."

"And by the way, I called Caroline and the others. Tomorrow is going to be quite lively."

"Renee's people should be here soon. Should I have them kill James first, or you? You can die together, after all."

There was an almost terrifying innocence in Paula's voice.

But Paula didn't notice that Shirley was now squatting on the ground, holding her head, muttering, "I don't believe it!"

She didn't even hear Paula's threats, which meant she was already lost in her own world.

Paula continued to mock her, unaware. "Brandon doesn't want you anymore. He doesn't want you."

After a while, Shirley suddenly looked up, her eyes filled with malice and rage. I had never seen such a terrifying look.

It was the look of someone ready to kill.

Royce quickly covered my eyes and whispered in my ear, "Don't look."

I didn't know how he sensed my fear, but he did manage to ease most of my anxiety.

I could smell the faint scent of his cologne.

My eyes were covered by his warm hands, but my ears were filled with the most terrifying sounds.

"Kill you, kill you!"

I heard Paula scream, and then there was silence.

I shuddered, a sense of foreboding rising in my heart.

My voice trembled as I asked, "Is Paula dead?"

Simon and Savannah were also stunned. After a while, I heard a low voice, "Yes, she's dead."

"How, how did she die?"

I couldn't control my trembling. Royce placed a hand on my shoulder, trying to comfort me.

"Shirley grabbed a fruit knife from the table and slit Paula's throat. She died instantly."

I heard more screams, this time from her parents, shouting, "Murder! Shirley killed someone! She's gone mad."

But soon, the sound of a knife stabbing into flesh echoed again, and then there was silence.

Royce's calm voice came from behind me. "Shirley killed her parents too. She's in the bathroom now, washing off the blood."

The scene was too horrifying to imagine.

He continued, "Shirley is coming downstairs."

He removed his hands, and I looked at the screen. The drone had moved to follow Shirley as she left.

Her eyes were devoid of fear or panic, only a bloodthirsty numbness.

This expression filled me with dread. I panicked. "No, Aria is still with her. She'll definitely do something to Aria. We have to find Aria, quickly!"

Royce nodded. "Don't worry, the drone will keep tracking Shirley. We'll rescue Aria."

The drone followed Shirley, who seemed oblivious to the faint buzzing overhead.

She stared straight ahead, walking until she reached the mountain.

Simon quickly led us downstairs, and we got into the car. He spoke into the radio, "Everyone in the neighborhood, follow her. Shirley is heading up the mountain."

We saw several figures following Shirley up the mountain.

No wonder we couldn't find where Shirley had hidden the child. She had hidden Aria in the mountains.

When we reached the foot of the mountain, I looked at the rugged path with anger.

Aria was hidden in such a place. Shirley was truly despicable.

Royce supported me as we climbed the mountain together.

The people following Shirley reported through the radio, "There's a chapel on the mountain. Shirley went behind it and into the deeper forest."

I quickly checked the drone footage. Shirley's figure was now obscured by the dense forest.

###chapter 209

I panicked immediately. "Follow her! She's going after my kid!"

I couldn't help but shout.

In these deep woods, who knows what might be lurking, and there's a cliff at the end. If she...

She just killed an entire family. Who knows what she might do to my child? I couldn't take that risk.

Royce grabbed my hand and whispered, "Don't worry, don't worry. Trust me, everything will be fine."

Simon turned to me and said, "Don't worry, Savannah and I will go ahead and make sure to bring your kid back safely."

I nodded, too exhausted to even thank them, feeling the world spinning around me.

Everything that had happened in the past few days felt like a long nightmare, and now it was reaching its final ###chapter.

Whether this nightmare would end or continue to haunt me for the rest of my life depended on what happened next. I couldn't help but worry.

Savannah and Simon moved ahead, following Shirley closely and leaving markers for us along the way.

Royce and I followed, step by step.

The walkie-talkie in my hand kept transmitting their voices.

"We see Shirley. She's heading deeper into the woods."

Just then, I heard a child's loud cry piercing through the night.

It was like something exploded in the dark sky.

My hands trembled uncontrollably. I quickly asked, "What's happening?"

Simon's voice sounded a bit excited. "We found Aria. Don't worry, she's still in Shirley's arms."

"She's holding the kid and hasn't moved. We didn't approach her, afraid she might do something to the kid."

Royce and I rushed over and saw Shirley sitting in a cave, holding the child.

As soon as I arrived, Shirley looked up sharply, her eyes, now dark and terrifying, fixed on me.

"Caroline, you really came?"

"I thought Paula was lying to me, but..."

Seeing that she had noticed me, I didn't bother hiding anymore. My voice trembled, "Shirley, I don't care what you think, the kid is innocent. If you have any issues, take them out on me. Just let my kid go."

Shirley chuckled softly. "Aria has been with me since she was little. I never intended to hurt her. Why would you say that?"

"But if you take another step forward, I will kill her right here."

Shirley pulled out a small knife from somewhere and held it to Aria's neck.

Feeling the cold blade, Aria started crying loudly, her voice echoing through the forest.

I bit my lip, too scared to move, as we all stood there, facing off against Shirley.

"Mom, mom!"

Aria couldn't speak yet, only managing to utter a few sounds, but even those small sounds broke my heart.

I looked at the child in Shirley's arms and pleaded, "Shirley, I'm begging you. Take me instead. Let my kid go. She's innocent. She doesn't deserve this."

Shirley scoffed, "You wish. I'm taking Aria and Brandon to a place where no one knows us. We'll never be apart. We'll be a happy family."

She looked down at Aria and asked eerily, "Isn't that right?"

But Aria, sensing the danger, cried even harder.

Aria's reaction seemed to annoy Shirley. She tightened her grip on Aria's neck. "Shut up! What's so bad about being with me?"

"I'll take you abroad. You'll be my and Brandon's child. We'll live a happy life together. Isn't that good?"

Aria's face turned blue and purple from lack of oxygen, her cries becoming intermittent.

I felt my heart shatter and fell to my knees. "Shirley, I'm begging you. Please let her go."

But Shirley wasn't moved. She snorted and didn't say a word.

However, she did loosen her grip on Aria's neck, and the child immediately took deep breaths, looking pitiful.

Just then, we heard footsteps behind us. Turning around, we saw Brandon approaching.

He glared at Shirley. "You wretch, you've already killed one of my kids. Are you trying to kill another?"

Shirley's eyes lit up when she saw Brandon. "Brandon, this is our child. Let's take her abroad and settle down, okay?"

"I'll be a full-time housewife, cook for the child, and take her to school. You just need to earn money. I'll take care of everything at home."

Her eyes showed a glimmer of hope as she looked at Brandon cautiously. "Let's live like that, okay?"

Brandon sneered and spat on the ground. "Shirley, look at yourself. Do you think you're worthy?"

"To be honest, I only tricked you into going abroad to use you. You're just the most useful dog I have."

"You're even better than a dog. A dog needs a bone to be controlled, but I just need to say a few words, and you obey me."

"Why would I want a woman as cheap as you?"

Shirley's hopeful look shattered into pieces.

She looked at Brandon in despair. "Why did you lie to me? Why?"

Her voice was heart-wrenching, filled with pain.

"Fine, if you lied to me, then I'll kill this child right now. If I can't have that life, then this child doesn't need to exist in this world!"

Her eyes turned cold as she reached for Aria's neck, seemingly intent on killing her.

At that moment, Aria murmured softly, "Ms. Ross, save me."

Shirley froze, looking at Aria in disbelief.

Shirley had been with Aria during her early years and had taught her that phrase many times.

But by the time the children could speak, Shirley had already been driven away by me, so they might have remembered it in their hearts.

Hearing it now, in this situation, Shirley hesitated, her eyes showing a struggle.

I quickly urged, "Shirley, what does Brandon matter? This child was raised by you. Can you really bear to hurt her?"

"Even though she was separated from you, she still remembers you."

"Shirley, do you really want to harm a child who truly loves you? Maybe she's the only one in this world who will treat you sincerely."

Tears streamed down Shirley's face.

She held Aria and cried uncontrollably.

Just then, we heard a whistling sound, and something hit the wall of the cave where Shirley was standing.

###chapter 210

Simon's face went pale, and he yelled, "It's gunfire! Get down!"

Everyone on our side hit the ground instantly, and Royce pushed me down too.

Brandon, scared out of his mind, dropped like a rock.

But I kept my eyes on Aria, who was right in the line of fire.

"No! Aria!"

She was completely exposed, in serious danger.

I wanted to get up, to take that bullet for her, but I couldn't move.

More shots rang out, all aimed at the two people at the cave entrance.

I saw Shirley turn and wrap herself around Aria, shielding her.

A split second later, a bullet zipped through the air and hit Shirley.

She shuddered, swayed, and then collapsed.

It felt like forever before we dared to lift our heads.

Simon scanned the area and said, "Shooter's gone. We can get up."

I rushed forward, pulling Shirley's body aside.

She was already starting to stiffen. When I moved her, I found Aria in her arms.

Aria looked terrified, not crying, just staring wide-eyed.

A bullet had gone through Shirley's back and was stopped by her hand before it could reach Aria.

Shirley had saved her.

I bent down and picked Aria up. Simon's team was already searching for the shooter.

Savannah stood by me, keeping watch. It felt safer now.

Aria finally started crying when she recognized my scent.

I looked down at Shirley's lifeless body, feeling a mix of emotions.

I should thank her for saving my child, but if it weren't for her, Aria wouldn't have been in danger in the first place.

I only glanced at her twice before walking away with Aria.

Someone like her wasn't worth my time.

Royce stepped forward and took Aria from my arms. "I'll take her," he said.

I nodded and followed him.

Brandon finally got up, looking around nervously before coming over.

"How's the kid?" he asked.

I just stared at him, not saying a word.

Realizing he wasn't welcome, Brandon awkwardly walked away.

We got on a bus that took us to the police station to give our statements.

There was still a gunman on the loose, after all.

After finishing up at the station, we headed back to the hotel.

I put Aria to bed and watched her sleep for a long time.

I couldn't believe I had her back. It felt like a dream.

If I woke up and she wasn't there, I would lose it.

I lifted the blanket to touch her little feet and pinch her cheeks.

Only after confirming she was really there did I finally relax.

Just then, there was a knock on the door.

I opened it to find Royce standing there. "How's the kid?" he asked.

"She probably hasn't had a decent meal in days. I got some food for her. Can you feed her?"

I glanced at the food in his hands, about to thank him, but everything went black, and my legs gave out.

The last thing I saw was Royce's terrified face and his hands reaching out to catch me.

When I came to, I was in a hospital bed.

I instinctively reached for the side of the bed, but Aria wasn't there. Panic set in. "Where's Aria? Where's Aria?"

Royce, who had been dozing off by my bed, woke up immediately and grabbed my hand. "Aria's still at the hotel. You fainted, so I brought you here."

His deep, gentle voice calmed my fears.

I looked at him, "What's wrong with me?"

"You were really stressed and haven't been eating well. You had low blood sugar and fainted."

"They gave you some glucose. You're recovering now, but you need to eat regularly from now on."

I nodded, "Can I go back to the hotel? I need to see my child."

Royce nodded and held my hand, "I know you're worried. We'll go back as soon as you finish this IV."

I nodded and sank into the bed, staring at the ceiling.

Royce gently pinched my earlobe, the warm touch bringing me back to reality.

He asked, "Want an apple?"

I shook my head.

But he insisted, putting the apple in my hand, "Remember what I said? You have low blood sugar. Eat this for some vitamin C and sugar."

I didn't move, but he calmly said, "Do you want me to feed you?"

"Not with your hands."

Not with his hands?

My gaze moved from Royce's tired face to his slightly blood-stained lips.

He seemed to notice my gaze, his lips curling slightly, as if giving me a hint.

I quickly took the apple from his hand and started eating.

As I ate, I suddenly realized something, "Did they find the shooter?"

Royce shook his head, "No, we think it was someone sent by Renee."

"That person was ruthless, aiming to kill."

"We only found some footprints and a few shell casings at the scene."

"They're doing ballistic analysis on the casings and the bullet from Shirley's body to see if they can identify the gun."

I nodded.

Thinking about what had happened in the woods, my body couldn't stop trembling.

If the shooter had been more accurate, they might have hit my child. The peace I had now wouldn't exist, leaving me with endless nightmares.

I was sure I would never be happy again.

All my happiness would vanish with my child's departure.

But fortunately, there were no "ifs." We succeeded in saving the child.

And it happened within the seven days Royce had mentioned.

I couldn't help but look up at him and quietly said, "Thank you."

His eyebrows moved slightly, and he just looked at me, "No need to thank me."

I tugged at the blanket, knowing what Royce wanted to say, but I couldn't bring myself to say it.

After this experience, my standards had started to waver.

Would I really be this stubborn for the rest of my life?

Knowing that Royce and I liked each other, yet still torturing ourselves.

###chapter 211

Just then, someone barged into the hospital room.

It was Brandon. He saw Royce by my bedside and shot us a suspicious look.

"Caroline, seriously? You went through all that trouble to divorce me just to be with this guy?"

His timing was impeccable. I was already on edge, and here he was, like a perfect target for my frustration.

I glared at Brandon. "You're still breathing? If I were you, I'd be too ashamed to show my face."

Brandon's expression darkened. "What the hell, Caroline? I came here because I was worried about you, and this is the thanks I get?"

"If I hadn't heard Aria was in danger, I wouldn't have rushed over."

I let out a bitter laugh. "Stop kidding yourself, Brandon. You're just a waste of space."

"Do you even know who was shooting on the mountain that day? It was Renee's people."

"They could've killed your child without a second thought."

"Didn't you notice something was off?"

"To them, you're nothing. They don't give a damn about your opinions, including your child, your own flesh and blood."

"If they had even a shred of respect for you, they wouldn't have shot at Aria."

Brandon clenched his fists, staying silent.

But I could see the turmoil in his eyes.

Maybe he always knew deep down but chose to ignore it. On the surface, he was the golden boy of the Jordan family, thinking he had all the power.

But this incident proved that no one in the Jordan family cared about him, not even his child.

"Brandon, you're pathetic! You can't even protect your own kid. What's the point of you being alive?"

"Get out of my room. Just looking at you makes me sick!"

He gritted his teeth, his face a storm of emotions.

I knew my words were harsh, but they hit Brandon right where it hurt.

No matter what, my goal was achieved. I wanted to sow distrust among the Jordan family.

Make them pay for kidnapping my child.

Brandon stood there, teeth clenched, before finally turning and leaving the room.

I watched his back with disdain and let out a cold snort. "Pathetic."

Royce had been watching me vent, a slight smile on his lips.

"Feel better after that?"

I nodded. "Better, but not enough. I need to let out all the anger I've bottled up over the past ten years to really feel good."

Just then, Savannah burst into the room.

She looked at me with a terrified expression, making me sense something was wrong.

Royce turned and frowned slightly at Savannah.

Savannah immediately left the room.

Royce told me to lie down and not move, then followed Savannah out.

I had a gut feeling something was up, and they were trying to keep it from me.

So after Royce left, I pulled out the IV, threw off the covers, and got out of bed.

Royce and Savannah were talking on the other side of the hospital corridor, and I quietly approached.

I overheard Royce asking in a low voice, "Are you sure about this?"

"Yes, Caroline's blood type is A, and Brandon's is O. There's no way they could have a child with blood type B."

"Double-check the child's blood type. Could there be a mistake?"

Savannah shook her head. "I've checked Aria's blood type three times. It's definitely B."

Hearing this, it felt like my world was shattering.

My heartbeat pounded like a drum, drowning out everything else.

It was as if the whole world had become distant.

I walked out in disbelief, grabbing Savannah's clothes. "Say that again?"

Savannah and Royce were both stunned to see me.

They hadn't expected me to be there.

Royce coughed, trying to guide me back to the room.

I shook off his hand and shouted at Savannah, "Say it again!"

Savannah looked to Royce for help, and after he sighed and nodded, she spoke.

"Caroline, we just did a thorough check-up on Aria at the hospital, worried he might be malnourished or something. But we found out Aria's blood type is B."

"At the same time, Brandon also had a check-up. I saw his results-he's type O."

My hand loosened, and I muttered, "But I'm type A. I'm type A..."

"Aria isn't my child?"

Savannah looked at me with difficulty. "I'm afraid so. But we don't know whose child he is."

"Caroline, don't be sad. We'll find the child you gave birth to. It seems Brandon might have swapped them."

But all I could think was, "Aria isn't my child. My child is gone."

I stumbled back to the room.

That one thought echoed in my mind, no matter what anyone said.

Until Royce, unable to bear it, grabbed my shoulders and shook me.

"Caroline, pull yourself together. Your biological child might still be out there. Isn't finding your child the most important thing right now?"

I looked at Royce, dazed. "But so much time has passed. With Brandon's methods, the child definitely wouldn't..."

I couldn't finish the sentence, couldn't say the child wouldn't be alive.

The thought was too cruel, like a boulder crushing me.

"Who says?"

"Brandon may be a jerk, but he wouldn't harm his own child. He might swap his child, but he wouldn't hurt him."

"Your most important task now is to find him!"

"I'll go with you. Remember? I said I'd help you find Aria, and he came back."

"Now I'm saying I'll help you find your biological child. Do you believe me?"

I looked into Royce's determined eyes and collapsed into his arms, sobbing.

I was crying for my fate, for the countless schemes and setbacks I'd faced. I'd never felt so wronged.

But now, I had to wonder, was tragedy my destiny?

I cried until Royce's shoulder was soaked, and he gently patted my back, trying to comfort me.

"Don't cry. Do you believe me?"

I let out all my pent-up emotions and felt a bit relieved.

I looked up at Royce through tear-filled eyes and nodded firmly.

"I believe you!"

Royce smiled softly, his thumb brushing away my tears.

###chapter 212

Just then, there was a knock on the door. It was Savannah.

She walked in and said, "Caroline, Aria's crying and wants you to hold her. Can you..."

She looked a bit embarrassed.

I shook my head. "It's okay, I'll go now."

Savannah led me to a lounge next to the examination room.

There was Aria, sitting on a chair and crying. Her small, lonely figure looked so pitiful.

My heart melted instantly.

I hurried over and picked her up. She buried her tear-streaked face into my neck.

"Mom."

She could only manage simple sounds, not yet able to speak properly.

I hugged Aria tightly and closed my eyes.

From the moment I learned the truth, I never thought of abandoning her. She might not have come from my body, but she was born from my heart.

Aria would always be my child, and nothing would change that.

I sat down with her on the chair, soothing her. "Don't cry, baby, don't cry."

After a long time, Aria finally fell asleep in my arms.

I carried her back to my original hospital room and laid her on the bed, covering her with my blanket.

I turned to Savannah and Royce. "We know the truth, but don't tell anyone else. I don't want Aria to grow up being judged by people who don't know the truth."

"As for my biological child..."

I took a deep breath, feeling a sharp pain in my heart.

I didn't know where he was or if he was okay.

And all of this was because of Brandon, that bastard who dared to switch my child.

I would never forgive him.

I left Savannah to watch over Aria and went with Royce to find Brandon.

Brandon had just left the hospital and returned to the hotel.

We sped all the way there and intercepted him in the hotel lobby.

Seeing us, Brandon looked stunned. "What are you doing here?"

Without a word, I slapped him hard across the face.

Brandon was furious, humiliated by the public slap.

"Caroline, what gives you the right to hit me?"

He tried to hit back, but Royce grabbed his wrist and pushed him back forcefully.

Brandon stumbled backward.

I glared at him.

"Where is my child?"

Brandon's eyes flickered with guilt. He hesitated, then said, "What child? Aria is at the hospital."

I sneered. "Stop pretending. Aria's blood type is B. You and I are A and O. How could we have a B type child?"

"Where is my biological child?"

Brandon looked away, then tried to act confident.

"Who knows if you had a child with another man? It has nothing to do with me. I don't know what you're talking about."

I sneered. "Brandon, do you think I'm like you, a cheating scumbag?"

"I'll ask you one more time. Where is my child?"

"How could you be so heartless to switch your own child?"

Brandon avoided my gaze. "I told you, I don't know. Stop bothering me."

"You had a child with another man and now you're blaming me."

I looked at Brandon, wanting to tear him apart.

He was so cruel to send away his own child.

"You won't talk?"

"Call the police."

"Okay, okay, I'll talk."

I sneered. "No need. I don't care who the biological parents are. I just want my child back. Get ready for jail."

I called the police, and they quickly arrived to take Brandon to the station.

Royce and I returned to the hospital, completed the discharge procedures, and went back to the hotel.

Now that we had found Aria, there was no reason to stay, so we quickly booked flights to leave.

As soon as we landed in Skyview City, Kathy came to pick us up.

She took Aria from my arms, looking worried. "Are you okay? I heard you were in the hospital."

I smiled. "I'm fine, just a bit shaken. Don't worry about me."

She nodded, genuinely concerned.

We went home together.

We were supposed to go directly to Suncrest City, but the company's bankruptcy liquidation was in its final stages. We came back to handle the handover.

After settling in at home, we went to the company on the day of the handover.

I walked in with Asher, arm in arm. Brandon's eyes burned with anger when he saw us.

He had used some tricks to get out of the police station in Silverpeak City and returned to Skyview City.

"Caroline, you went through all this trouble to get rid of me just to hand the company over to an outsider?"

I sneered. "Brandon, to me, you're the outsider."

"Asher grew up with me and is like a brother. You're just a scumbag who conspired with my family to harm me. Why would I give the company to you?"

"Did you think I wouldn't come back after what you did to me?"

Brandon glared at us, his teeth grinding.

We ignored him. He was just a defeated dog, not worth our attention.

After completing the handover, the company was officially in Asher's hands.

Brandon left with deep resentment in his eyes.

I watched him go, sneering. "This isn't over. He'll pay back every cent he owes."

After dealing with the company, I focused on finding my biological child.

I asked Simon to investigate the records of children born on the same day as Aria, but found nothing.

It seemed my child wasn't born on the same day as Aria.

I recalled that I first saw Aria on the seventh day after giving birth.

Brandon had told me the baby had some oxygen issues and was in an incubator for a few days.

At the time, I noticed something was off with Aria but didn't suspect anything because I loved Brandon and couldn't imagine he would harm me.

But now it was clear Brandon knew everything and might have orchestrated the switch.

Unable to find my child, I felt desperate. Every night, I dreamed of my child calling for me.

I hadn't slept well in days. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw him.

I knew I couldn't let myself break down. I had to stay strong.

I believed Royce when he said my child would eventually come back to me.

###chapter 213

After wrapping up everything in Skyview City, our family headed back to Suncrest City.

With only a week left before school started, I had to bring Briar back.

I promised Leo I'd bring her back and hand her over myself.

When our family, along with Holly and Savannah, landed in Suncrest City, Kelly came to pick me up personally.

She stood outside the airport with Brett and Briar, waiting for us.

I went up and hugged Kelly. After everything I'd been through recently, being with her felt like home.

Kelly didn't know what had happened, but she seemed to sense I'd been through a lot. She gently patted my back.

"It's okay, honey. You're home now."

Her words made my tears flow uncontrollably.

Brett looked at me curiously. "What's wrong, Mom? Why are you crying?"

I quickly waved my hand and squatted down to pinch Brett's cheek. "It's nothing, I just missed Grandma. Have you been good while I was away?"

Brett nodded. "Of course I have! Ask Grandma, I've been very well-behaved."

I held Brett's hand with one hand and Briar's with the other.

"As long as you two are good."

Our family got into the car, and Savannah drove us home.

Even though I had returned home many times, every time I saw our house coming into view, I felt a sense of peace and happiness.

Maybe that's the magic of home.

After we settled in and unpacked, I took a nap.

I hadn't slept well in Skyview City, my mind constantly occupied with thoughts of my lost child.

Now that I was home, I finally felt at ease and fell into a deep sleep.

When I woke up, it was already evening. I could hear the sounds of activity in the kitchen.

They were probably making dinner, accompanied by chatter and children's laughter.

The sounds made me feel at peace, and I stepped out of my room.

Holly was cooking in the kitchen, with Savannah helping her.

Kelly was on the couch, with Yves on one side and Aria on the other, gently patting their heads.

I sat next to Kelly and decided to tell her the truth.

I couldn't keep this from her.

"Mom, Aria isn't my biological child."

"Brandon switched her at birth. I left people in Skyview City to find out where my biological child was taken."

Kelly paused, her hand stopping on Aria's head.

"I had a feeling. Aria doesn't look like you did as a child."

I clutched my clothes. "Mom, I want to raise Aria. No matter if she's my child or not, I want to bring her up."

"I don't want to send her back to that monster Brandon."

I looked at Kelly anxiously, unsure of what to do if she disagreed.

But Kelly only paused for a moment before continuing to pat Aria's head.

"Did I say you should send her away? Aria is my granddaughter, and that won't change."

"Unless she grows up and doesn't recognize me."

I nodded heavily. "Thank you, Mom."

Soon, dinner was ready, and we all sat down for a lively family meal.

This sense of peace was something I had never experienced before.

After dinner, Savannah and I decided to take a walk down the nearby alley.

Eugene's case had moved to the criminal prosecution stage, and his verdict would be announced soon.

Aside from not finding my child, everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction.

I firmly believed that I would find my child and bring them back to me.

As Savannah and I walked deeper into the alley, a shadow suddenly rushed past us.

We both jumped.

The back of the alley was almost deserted, with only a few elderly residents who were likely asleep or not venturing out at this hour.

Savannah instinctively stepped in front of me, looking ahead.

"Who was that, moving so fast?"

I shook my head. "Probably just someone in a hurry. Let's keep walking."

We walked from one end of the alley to the other and then turned back.

When we reached the spot where the shadow had appeared, I glanced into the yard. "My dad bought this yard, but did someone just come out of it?"

Savannah looked at the dark yard for a long time. "Did we remember wrong?"

"Maybe it was from the next yard."

I nodded. "Maybe. Let's go home; it's late. No need to spook ourselves."

When we got home, Brett and Briar were doing their homework, while Aria and Yves played with toys in the baby playpen.

My mom sat next to Brett and Briar, watching them study.

Holly, having finished in the kitchen, came out. "Time for bed, Yves and Aria."

The two kids didn't want to leave and kept playing.

Holly smiled helplessly, picked them up, and carried them to their room.

"Do I have to catch you two?"

When it was time, my mom took Brett and Briar to their room.

I, having slept too much during the day, couldn't fall asleep, so I sat in the living room for a while.

There had been so much going on that my mind couldn't keep up.

Only in this quiet moment could I think clearly.

Just then, I heard crying from Brett and Briar's room.

I went in to check. Both kids were sleeping soundly in their beds.

Briar's blanket had fallen to the floor, probably kicked off during a nightmare.

I picked up the blanket and covered Briar, noticing a phone with a lit screen next to her.

She had brought the phone to stay in touch with Leo.

I intended to turn off the phone and place it on the nightstand, but the scary profile picture of her top contact caught my eye.

This person was at the top, meaning Briar often chatted with them, even more than with Leo.

The profile picture was terrifying-a grinning face with fangs that would scare any child.

Why was Briar chatting with this person so much?

Puzzled, I picked up the phone.

All the chat history with the scary face had been deleted, not a trace left.

This only made me more suspicious.

Briar was a good kid, still young. I couldn't believe she would delete the chat history without being prompted.

I checked her messages with Leo. Their conversations were normal, nothing unusual.

###chapter 214

After mulling it over, I decided to check out some other apps on Briar's phone.

The internet's a wild place these days, with people specifically targeting and luring kids.

I had to make sure Briar wasn't in any danger. If something happened to her, I wouldn't be able to face Leo.

Her phone seemed normal, just the usual apps.

But when I accidentally opened her photo gallery, I was floored.

Most of the photos were ordinary, but a few were of the layout of my house.

Every room was photographed, like someone was being shown the layout of my home.

The most alarming photo was of the small courtyard where Savannah and I had seen a shadow earlier today.

Briar had climbed into that courtyard and taken clear pictures of it. Something felt very wrong.

This wasn't something a normal kid would do.

And she hadn't sent these photos to her dad, Leo, or any other contacts. The only possibility was that she sent them to that creepy smiley face.

Why would that person need to know the layout of my house and the location of the nearby courtyard?

A thought crossed my mind: that creepy smiley face might be Renee.

I put the phone back and went to find Savannah.

Savannah was startled after hearing what I found. "Could someone be hiding in that courtyard?"

"That place has been empty for ages. If someone wanted to hide, it would be the perfect spot-no one goes there, and it's deserted."

I nodded. "It's possible."

"Savannah, come with me. Let's check it out tonight without alerting anyone."

Savannah hesitated. "Caroline, let me go alone. I don't want you to get hurt."

I shook my head. "You haven't been there before. I went there a lot when I was a kid."

Savannah finally agreed, and we headed to the courtyard under the cover of night.

The alley was pitch black, and the streetlights from earlier were no longer lit.

The nearby residents were all asleep, with only the occasional sound of a cat meowing.

We stood at the courtyard gate.

I had a key ready to open the door.

As soon as I pushed the wooden door, it creaked loudly.

The courtyard was old, with many worn-out fixtures.

There was a set of stone tables and chairs in the yard.

When we got closer, we saw that the dust on them had been wiped clean. This was unusual; if no one had been there, they should have been covered in dust.

This meant someone had been there to clean it.

Just then, we heard movement from inside the house. Someone had been startled by our presence and quickly climbed over the back wall, running away.

Savannah was startled and wanted to chase after them but hesitated, looking back at me.

I waved her on and grabbed a wooden stick from the yard for protection.

Savannah then climbed over the wall and gave chase.

She returned shortly, shaking her head. "That person ran really fast. They're gone now."

"Did you see anything unusual here, Caroline?"

"No, I think they all ran off. Let's check inside."

I pushed open the house door. It was dusty inside, but there were messy footprints on the floor.

This was proof that someone had been inside. Savannah examined the footprints and said, "Looks like three people have been staying here."

"Three people?"

A chill ran down my spine. Our suspicions from our evening walk were correct.

"Someone's been living here, and this must be connected to Renee."

Savannah frowned and nodded. "I'll inform Mr. Castillo right away. If these people know the layout of our house, they could come over anytime."

"We need to be on guard. There are kids and elderly people at home. We can't take any chances."

I nodded. "Go ahead and make the arrangements. Thanks."

We left the courtyard and locked the door.

In the darkness, the house looked like a gaping monster, eerily terrifying.

I thought moving back to Suncrest City would mean a peaceful life, but these people kept causing trouble.

After returning home, I checked on the kids and found them all safe in their rooms, which was a relief.

Savannah said, "You should sleep. I'll keep watch tonight."

I shook my head and sat on the couch. "I'm not sleepy. I'll stay here. You go rest, and we can take turns."

Savannah refused, so I pretended to be angry. "Are you disobeying me? Nothing will happen in the first half of the night. Go sleep, and I'll wake you later."

"We'll keep watch until morning. I doubt anyone would dare break in during the day."

Savannah finally agreed and went to her room.

Sitting alone in the living room, I couldn't help but feel scared.

Who knew how long those people had been around? If they had broken in earlier, Kelly and the kids would have been defenseless.

And I was in Skyview City at the time, unable to protect them.

"Thank goodness nothing happened."

I sighed in relief.

Around 2 or 3 AM, Savannah came out to take over.

I checked the time. "It's still early. Why don't you sleep a bit more?"

Savannah shook her head. "No, you need to rest. Your body hasn't fully recovered."

We switched places, and I went to bed.

But I couldn't sleep, tossing and turning, thinking about those footprints.

At dawn, I got up and went with Savannah to buy a security system.

If anyone tried to break into our yard at night, the infrared sensors would alert us.

Royce also arranged for two people to keep watch near our house, ready to respond at any time.

Kelly asked why we were going to such lengths. I didn't tell her about last night's discovery.

"We're all women here. If two intruders broke in, we wouldn't stand a chance. I thought a security system would make us safer."

Thankfully, Kelly didn't question it and agreed. "You're right. We have kids here. If something happened, it would be a big problem."

After installing the security system, Savannah and I went to the local office to check who had been in that courtyard.

"Let's see if the nearby cameras caught anything."

Unfortunately, the cameras only captured fleeting shadows, not clear faces.

Even the shadows were barely visible when slowed down.

Those people moved quickly and knew the camera locations well.

It couldn't have been a coincidence.

###chapter 215

I tried to casually ask Briar about the creepy smiley face on her phone.

To my surprise, Briar just shook her head. "No one."

But seeing her avoid my gaze, I knew someone had taught her to lie and not tell me.

I didn't push further. Briar is a good kid, and even if Renee had influenced her, it wasn't her fault.

We spent the next few days on edge, but the alarm system in the yard never went off.

It was almost time to head back to Skyview City.

With only ten days left before school started, she had to go back, whether she wanted to or not.

Briar pouted, looking at me with reluctance. "Ms. Sharp, I don't want to go home."

"I want to stay here."

Her pitiful expression tugged at my heart. Briar had been so timid at home, but here, she had completely opened up, becoming cheerful and outgoing.

Knowing how oppressive her home life was, I didn't want to send Briar back either.

But her parents were still around, and it wouldn't be right to keep her here without their consent.

"Sweetie, your dad misses you. Don't you want to go back?"

Briar shook her head vigorously. "I don't want to go back. Ms. Sharp, can I stay here and go to school with Brett?"

I was taken aback and gently patted her head. "Even if you want to stay, we need your parents' permission. I can't make that decision."

Briar's lips quivered, and she looked like she was about to cry.

I quickly tried to comfort her.

Brett tugged at my sleeve. "Mom, why don't we let Briar stay? I love playing with her. If she leaves, I'll have no one to play with."

I patted Brett's head and patiently explained, "Briar has parents too. What would they do if they miss her?"

"Would you want to live with another family and not be with your mom and dad?"

Brett frowned, thinking for a long time before shaking his head. "No, I want to stay with you, Mom."

He then turned to Briar, trying to console her like a little adult. "Briar, you should go back. You can come play with us again during the next break, okay?"

"Your parents probably miss you already."

Watching him comfort the crying Briar made me smile.

Just then, Briar suddenly looked at me and asked, "Ms. Sharp, is Grandma dead?"

Brett was also taken aback. I met their gazes for a moment before nodding.

"Yes, Grandma passed away. She went to heaven. If you miss her, you can look up at the stars."

But Brett interjected, "How is that possible? When people die, they're just gone. They don't turn into stars."

I shot Brett a look, signaling him to stop talking. We didn't want to upset Briar.

But Briar shook her head, her expression unusually mature for her age. "Ms. Sharp, you don't need to comfort me. Grandma didn't like me. She thought I was an alien."

"She didn't like my dad either, so I'm not sad."

Seeing her so accustomed to this, I couldn't help but sigh. She must have endured a lot to speak so calmly about it.

Feeling even more protective of Briar, I asked, "Who told you Grandma died? Your dad or your mom?"

To my surprise, Briar shook her head. "Neither."

I was stunned, remembering the smiley face on her phone.

Briar had no reason to lie to me. If she said it wasn't her parents, then it wasn't. So who was it?

Could the smiley face be someone other than Renee?

I frowned and exchanged a glance with Savannah.

Last night, Savannah and I had left a mark nearby. If anyone came back, we would know.

When we checked the desolate yard, the mark was gone, indicating someone had returned.

I told Savannah, "Maybe those people are using the phone to contact Briar. If they haven't left, they might still be instructing her to do things. We need to keep a close eye on her."

Savannah nodded. "Got it."

"Also, let's install surveillance in this yard. Make sure it's hidden. I want to see who these frequent visitors are."

"They've been bold enough to come back even after we discovered them. There must be something important keeping them here."

Savannah nodded again. After we left, she arranged for someone to install the surveillance.

The person Savannah found was efficient, quickly setting up the cameras.

Now, we just had to wait.

That night, I sneaked into Briar's room to check her phone.

All the videos and photos had been deleted, and the chat with that contact had been pushed down.

I couldn't tell if she did it on purpose or if someone instructed her.

As I put the phone down and turned around, Brett was standing right next to me.

He looked at me with curious eyes, as if asking what I was doing.

I quickly took his hand and led him out, telling him to be quiet.

"Mom, what were you doing by Briar's bed?"

I shook my head. "Nothing, just checking something. Don't tell Briar, okay?"

Brett frowned. "Mom, you shouldn't be looking at Briar's phone. That's not right."

Seeing his serious little face, I couldn't help but smile and ruffle his hair.

"You're right, but I'm worried about Briar."

"Worried?"

He looked at me curiously.

"Briar might be in danger, so I need to check to make sure she's safe. Do you think I would harm Briar?"

Brett thought for a long time before shaking his head. "No, you treat Briar even better than me."

I nodded. "Exactly. So can you trust me?"

"I need you to do something important for Briar's safety."

Hearing that I had a task for him, Brett's eyes lit up. "Mom, tell me!"

"Ask Briar about the smiley face on her phone. Make sure to ask quietly, so she doesn't know it's me who wants to know."

Brett nodded.

I continued, "Also, keep an eye on Briar. Has she been acting strange lately? Is she on her phone a lot?"

Brett frowned, thinking for a while before nodding. "Yes, and she took pictures of our house, saying she wanted to show them to her dad."

I nodded. "Alright, just remember your task. Go to bed now, and don't let Briar know."

Brett nodded, smiling at me. "Don't worry, I won't let you down."

I couldn't help but smile and gave him a high-five. "Let's protect Briar together!"

###chapter 216

After I got back to my room, my phone rang. It was Leo.

I was a bit surprised, thinking he was probably calling to remind me to bring Briar back soon.

I had already delayed a few days because of the small house issue, and she was about to start school. Leo must be anxious.

But when I answered Leo's call, it was pretty noisy on his end.

"Caroline, I'm already on my way to Suncrest City. I know you're usually busy and don't have time to take care of Briar, so I decided to come and get her myself."

"My flight is tomorrow morning. Can you send me your address so I can pick her up?"

I was stunned. Leo's visit was so sudden, I wasn't prepared at all.

But his reason was valid, so I could only send him the address. "How about I have Savannah pick you up?"

"No need, I'll come by myself. I don't want to trouble you."

I grew more puzzled. Leo's behavior was indeed strange. Why would he come so suddenly?

I went to find Savannah and told her about it. She was just as confused.

"If he was coming to our place, he should have given us a heads-up before buying the ticket. Who knows, he just decided to get on a plane without saying anything..."

That's exactly what puzzled me. Leo had always been a gentleman and very polite. How could he be so abrupt?

But regardless, Leo was already on his way. His visit was inevitable.

"Since he's coming, let's welcome him and see what he wants."

Savannah nodded. After returning to my room, I thought about it for a long time but couldn't figure out why Leo was coming so suddenly, so I just went to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up to a message from Leo saying he was already on the airport shuttle heading to the city.

He said he would take a cab from downtown and be here in about half an hour.

I went to tell Briar about it.

I said, "Your dad is probably coming to pick you up. Go wait for him at the door."

To my surprise, Briar looked unhappy.

After some persuasion, she reluctantly went to wait at the door.

Half an hour later, Leo got off the cab with a bunch of luggage, first hugging Briar.

Briar didn't resist, but her little face still looked sullen.

We welcomed Leo into the yard, and he looked around our house.

"Caroline, your house is really a gem. I heard it's about to undergo urban renewal?"

"Such a pity."

I looked at Leo, still not understanding his purpose, and could only nod. "Yes, it's about to undergo urban renewal."

He put his things down. "I came to pick up Briar. She told me she's having a great time here."

"So I thought I'd take a week off for her at the start of school, let her have her fun, and then take her back. I also need a break; it's been a while since I rested."

His reason was legitimate, leaving me no room to argue.

"Alright, I'll arrange a room for you. Stay here for a few days, no need to spend money outside."

Leo thanked me and didn't refuse.

Savannah led Leo to the room I had prepared for him. The more he walked in, the more impressed he looked.

"This house is huge!"

"This is our old family house. My dad bought it back later."

"Actually, it's not very convenient living here, being so far from the city."

"Not at all, this place is so elegant."

I nodded, not responding to his comment.

In Leo's room, Savannah pushed his luggage in, and I pointed to the items on the bed.

"These are all new. Don't mind them, Leo. Just make yourself at home."

Leo nodded. "Why would I mind? This is much better than my place."

After Leo went in, I told him to rest for a bit and come out for lunch.

After all, he had been on a flight all night and probably didn't sleep well.

As I closed the door, I noticed Briar standing outside.

I took her little hand. "Aren't you happy your dad is here?"

Briar shook her head. "I don't want to go back. He's here to take me away."

I sighed. "It's okay. You can come back anytime you want. My home will always welcome you, alright? There will always be a room for you."

Briar pouted and said nothing.

Before noon, Leo came out of his room.

Since Kelly was out when he arrived in the morning, this was their first official meeting.

Leo shook hands with Kelly, handing her some specialties from Skyview City. "Mrs. Sharp, sorry for the trouble during this time."

"Briar has been a handful for you."

My mom waved her hand. "It's no trouble at all. Just an extra plate at the table. Don't worry, just make yourself at home."

"If you need anything, just let us know. We'll take good care of you."

Leo nodded. "But I still feel a bit embarrassed, so let me help with any chores. Don't hesitate."

I pulled him over. "You're a guest. How could we let you do chores?"

"Leo, have a seat on the couch. We're about to eat."

Holly brought the dishes to the table, and the family, along with the unexpected guest Leo, had a meal together.

In the afternoon, I asked Briar to show Leo around the neighborhood.

After all, she had been here for over a month and was familiar with the area. It was a good chance for the father and daughter to catch up.

In the evening, Leo called to say they wouldn't be back for dinner. He wanted to take Briar out to eat.

I nodded in understanding. They probably had things to talk about. Eating out was fine.

They returned after visiting the night market. We exchanged a few words, and then he went to his room to sleep.

After my shower, I had just laid down when Leo knocked on my door.

He looked troubled. "Caroline, sorry to bother you so late, but I can't find Briar."

I was shocked. "How could that be? Briar is usually very well-behaved and wouldn't run off."

Leo nodded, looking distressed. "I wanted to chat with her before bed, just to talk about going back in a few days. But she said she wanted to stay here."

"Like Brett and the others, she wants to go to school here."

"I couldn't agree to that. It's already enough trouble for you. So I said no."

"Who knew Briar would get upset and run off. Maybe I was too harsh."

I sighed. "Kids at this age are very sensitive, Leo. You need to be careful with your tone."

Leo nodded. "I know. That's why I came to see if she's with you."

I shook my head. "Did you check Brett's room?"

###chapter 217

Because Briar was scared to sleep alone, I arranged for her to sleep with Brett.

The two kids always had endless things to talk about before bed, and we had even scolded them for it before.

So my first thought was that Briar had gone back to her room.

But Leo shook his head and said, "No, I just checked. She didn't go back to her room. It's late, and I'm worried she might have run off. I'm not familiar with this area, so I need your help."

His voice carried a hint of subtle apology.

I quickly waved my hand. "Losing a child is a big deal. I'll grab a coat and go out with you to look for her."

After putting on my coat, I went to wake up Savannah.

She was still awake and immediately got up to join me when she heard Briar was missing.

Leo stayed at home to check if Briar was hiding in another room.

Since she wasn't familiar with the outside, Savannah and I went out to look for her.

The yard was pitch dark, with a dim yellow streetlight illuminating a small area, making the yard visible.

We didn't see Briar anywhere.

Savannah and I exchanged a glance. "Could she have run outside? Isn't she scared to be out alone this late?"

Savannah nodded. "It's possible. She's gotten pretty familiar with the area by now. She could be anywhere. Let's go look for her."

We decided to head out but wanted to inform Leo first.

Leo had checked several rooms but hadn't found Briar. He was starting to panic, sweat forming on his forehead.

"Leo, Savannah and I are going out to look for her. You stay here since you're not familiar with the area."

"Don't worry. Briar might have just found a place to hide. She's been running around here for over a month and knows the area well. She'll be fine."

Leo nodded, his face full of worry.

Our coming and going woke Kelly. She came out, wrapped in a coat, and asked what was happening.

"Mom, go back to sleep. It's nothing serious. Briar had a fight with her dad and ran off. We're just going to look for her."

Leo nodded. "I'm really sorry, Mrs. Sharp. I didn't expect Briar to be so stubborn. Please go back to rest. We'll handle it. Sorry for the trouble."

Kelly waved her hand. "It's no trouble. Do you need me to help look for her?"

"No, no, the three of us can handle it. I'm already feeling bad for troubling Savannah and Caroline."

I nodded. "Mom, don't worry. Go back to sleep. We can handle this."

Kelly nodded and went back inside, but not before advising Leo, "Kids are sensitive. Talk to her nicely and don't argue with her again."

After Kelly went back to her room, Savannah and I headed out to the alley.

I told Savannah, "Let's split up and search separately."

Savannah nodded but looked worried. "I'll go with you. We haven't checked the people in the yard yet. I'm afraid it might be dangerous for you to go alone."

"What danger could there be? Don't worry, I'll be fine."

"The most important thing now is to find Briar," I said firmly.

Savannah couldn't argue with me and reluctantly agreed.

We walked around the alley and met back at my front door, but there was no sign of Briar.

Leo was anxious. "Where could Briar have gone? Why is she so troublesome? I only said a few words to her."

Savannah and I tried to comfort him, telling him not to worry.

Our yard had a front and back section, but the back was usually locked since we didn't use it much.

However, a small child could easily crawl through the space.

Savannah and I decided to check the backyard, with Leo following us.

I took out the key and opened the backyard door.

There was a small building and a well covered by a stone slab, which Briar couldn't possibly lift.

There were two side rooms with locked doors, leaving no space to enter.

But the first-floor window of the small building was broken, and Briar could have crawled through it.

We decided to open the building door and go inside.

The building was empty, filled with old furniture and items we no longer used.

The air was thick with dust, making me cover my nose. It had been a long time since anyone had been here. Could Briar endure the dust?

Regardless, we had to search.

We looked around the first floor but found no trace of Briar.

We moved to the second floor, and Savannah suddenly stepped on something.

Looking down, we saw it was a hair clip.

Leo recognized it immediately. "It's Briar's hair clip. I brought it for her from Skyview City. She loved it and was wearing it earlier."

We exchanged glances. "It looks like Briar was here!"

But why did she lose her hair clip, and where did she go?

We had a bad feeling.

There were strangers around, and Briar's sudden disappearance was suspicious.

Leo frowned deeply, full of regret. "It's all my fault. If I had just taken her back, this wouldn't have happened."

"If I hadn't scolded her, maybe she wouldn't have run off."

We searched the second floor but found no sign of Briar. We had to go back to the front yard.

Leo looked at me, troubled. "Caroline, what should we do now?"

"Could Briar have been kidnapped?"

"Should we call the police? But what if they hurt Briar? She's my only daughter. If something happens to her, I don't know what I'll do."

I thought for a long time.

Briar running off and being kidnapped by those people seemed likely.

They might be hiding nearby.

Briar could be in danger, and the situation was urgent.

I gritted my teeth and told Savannah, "Call the police. We need their help. We can't find her on our own."

Savannah nodded and quickly went outside.

Leo was pulling at his hair in regret, tears falling.

I had never seen him like this and tried to comfort him. "Leo, don't be sad. We will find her. Briar is smart and will protect herself."

"Trust the police and trust us."

###chapter 218

After Savannah reported to the police, I had her check the surveillance footage.

It was already late at night. When we got back to the living room, Kelly was on the couch, looking really worried. She was just as concerned about Briar as I was.

"Did you find her?" she asked, her voice trembling.

I shook my head. "No, but we found one of Briar's hair clips in the backyard. So, she was there at some point."

Kelly's face tightened with worry. "What? We need to call the police right now."

"Briar wouldn't just disappear for no reason," I said, trying to stay calm.

I nodded. "Don't worry, we've already called them."

Savannah pulled out her laptop, and we got ready to watch the surveillance footage together to figure out what happened.

Leo walked over and asked, "Where's this footage from? Can it show Briar?"

Savannah nodded. "Yeah, it should."

"There's a surveillance room across the street that monitors the whole block. It should have footage of the backyard."

Savannah quickly pulled up the footage from tonight, and we anxiously watched the dark screen.

Around 10 PM, Briar indeed ran out alone. She looked around the yard and then headed to the backyard, closing the door behind her as if she didn't want to be seen.

But no matter how we adjusted the angles, there was no footage of the backyard after that.

Since the area had been abandoned for a while, we hadn't installed any cameras there.

I contacted Simon and asked him to make sure the local police cooperated with our efforts.

With Briar missing, I was extremely worried about her safety.

Simon quickly agreed and got the local police to coordinate with us.

We stayed up in the living room until dawn. Holly came in and was surprised to see us all there.

"Why are you all up so early?" she asked, looking confused.

I shook my head. "Briar ran out last night, and we haven't found her yet."

Leo's face showed even more distress. He clutched his hair and muttered, "It's all my fault, all my fault."

Holly, who had grown fond of Briar over the past few days, also became anxious.

"Did you call the police?"

I nodded. "Yeah, we did. Holly, could you make some breakfast? We probably won't be able to sleep today and will need to go to the police station later."

She nodded and hurried to the kitchen.

When breakfast was ready, the kids sat at the table.

Brett, with curious eyes, asked, "Where's Briar? Why isn't she here for breakfast?"

I shook my head and said, "Briar went out last night and hasn't come back yet."

His eyes widened. "Why? Why did she go out?"

I glanced at Leo, who was fidgeting at the table, his eyes bloodshot and looking very distressed.

I shook my head. "It's okay, she just went out. She'll be back soon."

Brett was about to ask more questions, but Holly quickly stuffed a sandwich into his mouth. "Brett, eat your breakfast first. We'll talk about it later."

She wanted to prevent him from saying anything that might upset Leo.

Leo stared blankly at the table, not touching his food.

We couldn't help but try to comfort him. "Leo, you need to eat something."

"You need your strength to help find Briar," I urged.

Leo slowly shook his head. "It's all my fault, all my fault. If it weren't for me, she wouldn't be missing. I'm not a good dad. It's all my fault."

He had been repeating this since last night.

We sighed, knowing that with Briar missing, Leo was the one suffering the most.

Kelly also tried to comfort him. "Leo, you need to eat something. Otherwise, you won't have the energy to look for Briar later."

After much persuasion, Leo finally ate a little, just enough to fill his stomach.

The police had come by to check the surveillance footage and started canvassing the area.

All we could do was wait for results.

As time passed, and with Briar missing for 24 hours, the police still had no leads.

Our hearts sank.

Savannah and I took turns sleeping for a few hours, but Leo hadn't closed his eyes for 24 hours.

We tried to get him to rest, but he just shook his head.

I understood the pain of losing a child, so I knew why he couldn't sleep.

Just then, the police contacted us with news.

They had found footage from a dashcam in an alley behind the backyard.

The video showed a small figure running into the opposite alley.

The police sent us the video to confirm if the child was Briar.

Leo nervously watched the video. When it played, the screen showed an empty alley.

Because it was from a car's perspective, the view was limited.

We could only see a small figure running past, but based on the skirt and height, Leo nodded vigorously. "Yes, that's Briar, that's my daughter!"

Seeing his certainty, I nodded and had Savannah inform the police.

I reassured Leo, "Leo, you don't need to worry now. This means Briar wasn't taken; she just hid herself. But Briar is stubborn, so she hasn't come back yet. Don't think the worst."

This seemed to comfort Leo a bit. He nodded slightly and hoarsely said, "Thank you."

However, the alleys beyond were more remote, and the surveillance wasn't great, making it still difficult to find Briar.

Leo didn't know, but Savannah and I were aware that three strangers had moved into the area.

So, there was still a possibility that Briar had been taken, but we didn't dare say this in front of Leo, fearing it would crush his newfound hope.

In the video, Briar moved quickly. If not for that car, the cameras might not have caught her at all.

Her movements seemed to deliberately avoid the camera angles.

But how could a child know where the cameras were?

Savannah and I exchanged worried glances.

Then Savannah suddenly said, "Maybe Briar really did hide on purpose. Brett plays with her all the time. We should ask him where they usually hide. He might have a clue."

I nodded. Although we knew there were strangers around, we couldn't rule out the possibility that Briar had wandered off on her own.

"Alright, let's find Brett and have him show us where he and Briar usually play. Maybe we can find her."

###chapter 219

Savannah nodded and quickly headed out.

But after circling the block, she couldn't find any trace of Brett.

She came back and asked me, "Caroline, did Brett tell you where he was going?"

I was a bit surprised. "What? You couldn't find Brett?"

"He usually plays around here."

Savannah shook her head. "No, I checked all the places he usually goes, but I didn't see him."

I frowned. "Did you check the neighbors' houses? Make sure to check all the nearby homes. Brett might be there."

Savannah nodded and went out again immediately.

She returned shortly, shaking her head to indicate she still hadn't found Brett.

My heart tightened, and I got up to check the backyard.

I was worried Brett might have gone to the small building back there.

As expected, he wasn't there. We searched everywhere, even using the security cameras, but there was no sign of Brett.

I was certain Brett wouldn't get lost. I had taught him from a young age to avoid danger and not to wander off without parental permission.

He knew to hide from danger and to run if a stranger approached.

So Brett had a strong sense of safety. He was probably hiding on purpose, which is why Savannah couldn't find him.

I was furious, biting my lip. With Briar missing, we were already overwhelmed, and now Brett was adding to the chaos.

As noon approached, Brett still hadn't returned. Usually, he and Briar would play outside all morning and come back for lunch.

Holly asked me what to do. I said, "Let's eat as usual. We'll see if he comes back."

Sure enough, at lunchtime, Brett's small figure walked in through the door.

I glared at him. "Where have you been? Do you know Savannah and I have been looking for you? How could you be so irresponsible?"

Brett looked scared. "I'm sorry, Mom. I just went out to play for a bit. I didn't hear Ms. Faith calling me."

"Promise you won't run off again, okay?"

Seeing his pitiful, apologetic face, my heart softened, and I nodded.

"Alright, as long as you know you were wrong. By the way, did you see Briar? Where do you two usually play?"

Brett's eyes flickered with guilt, and he shook his head vigorously.

"I don't know where she went."

I narrowed my eyes, suspicious. Brett and Briar were usually inseparable. How could he not be worried now that Briar was missing?

I felt something was off.

I cleared my throat. "Never mind. Let's eat. We've already called the police to help find her."

Savannah looked at me, puzzled, as if she wanted to ask why I wasn't having Brett go with the police to search.

I winked at her without saying anything.

I suspected Brett might know where Briar was. Otherwise, he wouldn't be acting this way.

Kids are easy to read; their emotions are written all over their faces.

Brett quickly finished his meal and sat on the couch to watch TV.

But his eyes kept darting towards the kitchen, looking sneaky, as if he had a secret.

No one else noticed, but I did. After a while, when Holly came out of the kitchen, Brett made an excuse to go to the fridge for an ice cream.

Soon after, he came out quietly, holding a plastic bag close to his chest.

He ran out the door, calling back to me, "Mom, I'm going out to play. I'll be back by evening, don't worry."

Savannah and I exchanged glances. "Caroline, doesn't this seem a bit odd?"

"This kid is usually glued to Briar. How could he want to play now that she's missing?"

I chuckled. "Follow him. I suspect he knows where Briar is, which is why he's acting this way."

Leo, who had been sitting quietly with a heavy heart, looked up eagerly at my words.

"Really, Caroline?"

I nodded confidently. "Brett finished his meal quickly this morning and slipped away. He ate a lot more than usual, which means he probably took some sandwiches with him."

"Just now, after we finished eating, Holly put the leftovers in the fridge. Brett went to the kitchen and came out with a plastic bag. What do you think he was doing?"

"Briar hasn't eaten in a while. She's probably starving. Brett must be bringing her food."

Savannah nodded excitedly and quickly followed him.

Leo looked at the door with anticipation.

In less than half an hour, Savannah returned, holding a child in each hand.

Brett looked defeated, obediently letting Savannah lead him, while Briar, looking scared, burst into tears upon seeing us all sitting on the couch.

Leo stood up immediately, shouting, "Briar, where have you been? Do you know how long we've been looking for you? The whole family has been worried sick. How could you do this to Ms. Sharp?"

I quickly pulled Leo back to sit down, telling him to lower his voice.

Briar trembled at Leo's yelling, looking up at me with tear-filled eyes. "I'm sorry, Ms. Sharp. I didn't mean to cause trouble."

My heart softened, and I sighed.

She looked so disheveled, covered in dust, her once clean face now dirty.

Her little floral dress was now almost black.

I told Savannah, "Savannah, go tell the police we've found Briar."

Savannah nodded and went out to make the call.

I took Briar's small hand. "Where have you been these past few days?"

Leo, eyes red, glared at Briar. "Do you know how long we've been looking for you? What if something happened to you?"

Briar's tears fell even harder. "I'm really sorry, Dad, Ms. Sharp. Please forgive me."

"Do you know how worried your dad has been? He hasn't slept since you ran off."

"What if you really got lost? What if someone bad took you? You'd never see your dad again. Would that make you happy?"

Briar shivered and cried even more.

She seemed to understand the impact of her actions. Girls mature faster than boys, so she probably thought more about it.

Brett, however, looked defiant. "Mom, Briar didn't want to leave. Why did you make her?"

"She had no choice but to hide. You shouldn't scold her."

I looked at Brett's righteous little face and snorted.

"I haven't even scolded you yet. Did you bring food to Briar?"

Brett nodded matter-of-factly. "Yes, I was afraid she'd be hungry."

###chapter 220

He had this look on his face like he was completely justified, and it made me want to laugh.

But I held it in, because now was the time for a serious talk.

I said coldly, "Do you realize how much trouble you caused by hiding like that?"

"Brett, you knew we called the police. Why did you still help Briar?"

It was the first time I had ever been this stern with Brett, and he seemed a bit scared, shrinking his neck.

"But Briar didn't want to go home. She wanted to go to school with me."

"So what? Whether Briar can stay and go to school is up to her dad. What does it have to do with you?"

Brett pouted and stayed silent.

I looked at Briar. "If we hadn't found you, how long were you planning to hide?"

"I wanted to wait until my dad left, then I could stay and go to school with Brett."

I sighed. Briar seemed mature, but she was just a kid, thinking in such a straightforward and simple way.

"Did you ever think about how worried your dad would be? Did you think about how anxious we were?"

Brett looked at me defiantly. "Why not? Why can't Briar stay? You need to give me a reason."

"Because Briar's home is in Skyview City, not Suncrest City."

"Leo's job is also in Skyview City. Do you want Briar to be separated from her dad?"

"If you want, I can send you to another city for school, so you won't live with me. Would you like that?"

Brett fell silent.

But today, I had to be strict with him. He dared to hide Briar and had his own ideas. Who knows what he might do in the future?

"These past few days, our whole family has been on edge, not sleeping well or eating properly because we were looking for Briar. Didn't you see that, Brett?"

"I saw it."

"Then why didn't you tell us where Briar was? We could have talked it out. If you think running away solves everything, then nothing will ever get resolved."

Brett hung his head and said nothing.

Briar was sobbing. "Ms. Sharp, I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have run away."

"I won't do it again."

"But I really want to stay in Suncrest City. I don't want to go back to Skyview City."

"At home, my parents are always busy. They don't want to take care of me. Only here do I feel happy."

Leo sighed helplessly, his eyes red.

"It's my fault. I shouldn't have scolded you that day."

"Next time, if you have a problem, talk to me. I promise I'll listen, okay? But you can't run away again."

Kids are like that. If you ignore them, they might not cry. But if you show you care about their grievances, those grievances get magnified instantly.

Briar threw herself into Leo's arms, crying loudly.

The sight of the father and daughter hugging made our eyes sting with tears.

"Alright, now that she's back, let your dad get some rest. He hasn't slept in days."

"As for you, Brett, you were wrong in this matter. Whether you admit it or not, you have to accept the punishment."

"Go to your room and stand in the corner. Don't come out unless I say so."

Brett pouted, looking defiant.

I turned to Briar. "You were wrong too. You need to go as well."

The two kids trudged upstairs, one after the other. Leo looked at me hesitantly.

"Caroline, if Briar really likes it here, can I let her stay..."

He trailed off, watching me carefully.

I shook my head decisively, but I saw a complex emotion in his eyes. It was like reluctance, mixed with something else I couldn't quite identify.

This feeling was unfamiliar to me. In my impression, Leo was always a gentle and refined man, not someone who would show such emotions.

I thought he might think I disliked Briar, so I explained.

"Leo, don't get me wrong. I really like Briar and want her to stay."

"But this time, it's absolutely not possible."

"She's still young. Maybe this punishment won't leave a deep impression, but if she learns that running away gets her what she wants, she'll make a habit of it."

"What will you do if it happens again? Luckily, nothing bad happened this time. But if she runs away and someone takes her, you'll regret today's decision."

"So in the future, if she wants to come, our door is always open. But this time, we have to let her know she was wrong. Running away doesn't mean her wishes will be granted."

Leo clearly understood my words. He nodded, showing he got it.

"You're right. I didn't think it through."

"I'm not as good at this parenting thing as you are."

I shook my head and smiled. "It's something you learn bit by bit. I came to this conclusion gradually."

"Leo, you're a man, and Briar is a girl. You need to guide her with patience, so as a father, you might think less about these things."

He nodded.

I said, "Alright, Leo, I'll go talk to them later. You go get some sleep. I'll make sure they understand the seriousness of this."

Leo nodded. His eyes were dark with circles, and they were bloodshot. The sleepless nights had taken a toll on him.

"Thank you, Caroline."

He got up and went back to his room.

I went upstairs to find Briar. She and Brett were standing in different rooms as punishment.

I said to Briar, "Do you know what you did wrong this time?"

"You shouldn't use running away to achieve your goal of going to school here. You're using the love of the people who care about you as leverage. You think your dad loves you, so he'll agree because you ran away."

Briar hung her head and said nothing.

"But your actions deeply hurt your dad, do you understand?"

Briar nodded. "I know, but I didn't mean to."

I patted her head. "I know you didn't mean any harm. You just wanted to stay."

"But did you think about how your dad would be alone in Skyview City if you came here?"

"He would be lonely and miss you."

"Don't you think it's sad? His life revolves around you, but you want to leave him."

"How do you expect him to live?"

Briar looked at me with tearful eyes. "I really know I was wrong, Ms. Sharp."

"My dad loves me so much. I shouldn't have done that."

"I'll go back to Skyview City and live with my dad."

###chapter 221

Seeing her say that, I nodded, feeling relieved.

"That's my girl. I know you love it here, so it's not impossible for you to come back."

"You can go home and slowly convince your dad to leave his job in Skyview City and move to Suncrest City. That way, you can be here too."

"But you know, it's a long process and won't happen overnight."

"Your dad's job isn't something he can just quit. Are you willing to wait?"

Briar nodded firmly. "I am, Ms. Sharp."

I patted her little head. "Good girl. When your dad wakes up, go talk to him. He's been really worried these past few days."

After talking with Briar, I went to find Brett.

He was standing in the corner, pouting and looking defiant.

I sat on the bed and spoke to him gently.

"Brett, first, I want to praise you."

Brett seemed surprised by my opening, his eyes widening as he looked at me.

"Mom, you're not mad at me?"

I shook my head. "You were willing to make and bring food to Briar, which shows you care about her. You kept her whereabouts a secret, which means you're loyal and consider Briar a friend."

"If you knew where Briar was and didn't care, I would be even more upset."

Brett nodded. "Exactly, I brought Briar food. Why did I still get punished?"

I continued, "That's the next issue. Helping others is right, but you need to consider if what you're doing is right or wrong."

"Let me ask you, was it right for Briar to run away from home?"

Brett frowned and thought for a long time before shaking his head. "No, it wasn't."

I nodded in relief. "Exactly. Briar running away was wrong. You knew where she was and didn't tell us, instead, you helped her. Isn't that like helping her run away?"

"When you were helping Briar, did you think about how worried her dad would be? How anxious we would be?"

Brett shook his head. "No, I didn't think about that."

I patted his little head. "You're young, so it's understandable. But I'm happy you wanted to help Briar."

"Just remember, the best way to help her is to tell us parents where she is so we can bring her back, okay?"

Brett thought for a moment, then nodded seriously.

"Mom, you're right. I was wrong. I didn't think it through. I not only hurt Briar but also made Mr. Schmidt worry for so long."

"And I wasted the police's time because of our stubbornness. That was wrong."

Hearing him say that, I patted Brett's head in relief.

There's nothing more gratifying than seeing your child grow up to be well-mannered and considerate.

"You're my good boy."

"What should you do next?"

"Apologize to Mr. Schmidt and to everyone I worried, including Ms. Faith."

I nodded in satisfaction. "Good job."

Having resolved the issues with both kids, I felt a great sense of relief.

But as I left Brett's room, my thoughts drifted to my other child still out there, and my mood darkened.

He's still so young and impressionable.

If Brandon handed him over to people who don't know how to raise him, what if he turns into a bad kid?

I couldn't help but sigh.

I hope Simon in Skyview City can find my child soon.

I really don't want him to be out there alone.

After dealing with the kids, I went to find Kelly.

She noticed my worried expression and looked surprised.

"What's wrong? Tell me."

I hugged Kelly tightly. "I'm worried. I've raised Brett so well, but what if the child out there isn't raised properly?"

Kelly paused, then sighed and patted my shoulder.

"You always think the worst. You've done your best. What more can you do?"

"The rest is up to fate. Let's see if God is willing to bring that child back to you."

"Believe that no matter what, the child will understand you."

I nodded firmly. "I hope so."

Leo stayed with Briar for two days, showing her around Suncrest City, then returned to Skyview City.

The day he left, Briar was teary-eyed, looking at the scenery outside the car window.

I almost softened and let Leo leave Briar with us.

But I knew I couldn't do that. Briar is ultimately a Jordan family child.

Whether she wants to come back in the future is up to her, but I can't keep her here.

After Briar left, Brett was also sad, but he quickly got excited about his new school.

We chose a nearby elementary school for him. On his first day, he came back happily, saying the teachers and classmates were great, and he loved it there.

Seeing him so happy, I felt relieved. My biggest fear was that he would have a bad experience at school.

But thankfully, he didn't show any signs of that and still loved going to school.

Soon, Yves and Aria were old enough for preschool. Luckily, there was one near Brett's school, so we could pick them up together.

We quickly enrolled them in the nearby school.

The day the kids started school, the house was unusually quiet.

My mom looked at me, feeling a bit down. "When the kids were here, it was noisy. Now that they're at school, the house feels empty..."

"Just like when you went to school, I felt so sad."

I hugged Kelly to comfort her. "Wait until the weekend when they're home. You'll be busy again and probably annoyed by them."

That made Kelly laugh, and she shook her head.

In the evening, the three kids sat in the living room.

I looked at Kelly. "Still feeling empty?"

Kelly rolled her eyes at me.

As for Brandon, he didn't even ask why the kids weren't going back to Skyview City for school. He didn't show any concern.

I don't believe he can take care of a child properly. But it's better this way, so I don't have to deal with him.

###chapter 222

I was living a peaceful life in Suncrest City until Simon suddenly called me.

"Caroline, I found a video that someone accidentally recorded years ago. It seems to have captured your biological child. Take a look," he said.

I was stunned and quickly nodded, urging him to send it to me.

In no time, he sent over the video. In it, Karen was holding a child in her arms, rocking him slightly, and then she nodded coldly.

I stared intently at the child's face, almost certain that he was my biological child.

His features resembled mine so much that I couldn't deny it.

And from Karen's behavior, it was clear she knew what my child looked like, which meant she was fully aware of the child swap.

I bit my lip, tears of anger streaming down my face.

That wretched Karen, she never told me the truth before she died.

She really intended to take this secret to the grave. If I hadn't discovered it, my biological child would have been lost forever.

The thought made me cry even harder, wishing I could dig Karen up and whip her three hundred times.

I quickly called Simon back. "Where did you get this video? What's going on?"

"That's my child, my child," I said, my voice trembling with emotion.

Simon tried to calm me down. "Caroline, don't get too worked up. If this child is indeed yours, we can find someone to create an age progression image and search the entire city."

"The video was recorded by a head nurse when your child was born. She noticed Karen's coldness towards the baby and decided to document it."

"She intended to show it to you as evidence so you could keep an eye on Karen and prevent her from mistreating the child. But the nurse got pregnant herself and went on maternity leave, and she forgot about it."

"And the day Karen took the child, he left the hospital and never returned. So I suspect the swap happened that day."

I nodded, tears welling up in my eyes as I clutched my phone.

"Simon, please, you have to find my child. He's still so young; he needs his mother."

Simon reassured me, "Caroline, don't worry. We'll find him. Now that we have his face, it will be easier."

After hanging up, I watched the video of my child over and over again, pounding the wall in frustration. The Jordan family was a den of devils.

I couldn't help but sob uncontrollably, and Savannah came in, startled by my state.

She rushed to hug me, asking frantically, "Caroline, what's wrong? Why are you crying?"

I couldn't speak, just continued to cry.

Savannah glanced at the door, then held me tighter. "Caroline, talk to me. Keeping it inside will only make it worse. Let me help you."

I hugged her back and told her about the video Simon had sent me.

"Those bastards from the Jordan family swapped my child just days after he was born, and I never saw him again."

"I thought the money Karen left was for her three kids' education, but it turns out it was just to keep me from neglecting Aria."

"That bitch!" I cursed through gritted teeth.

Savannah hugged me tighter and cursed along with me.

"You're right, Caroline. The Jordan family are a bunch of bastards. Don't let them get to you. With the technology we have, we'll find your child. Trust me."

"It's just a matter of time. Believe in our country."

"The Jordan family's scheme won't succeed."

I nodded firmly, but the tears kept falling.

I couldn't stop thinking about how pitiful my child must be, out there somewhere.

I wondered if he was being well taken care of, if he had enough to eat, good clothes, and toys to play with.

Yves and Aria, who were the same age, were already picky eaters and starting to babble.

I worried if the family who took him in treated him well or if they were harsh with him.

All these thoughts made me anxious.

But I felt powerless, and that was the worst part.

I knew my child was somewhere on this planet, but I couldn't find him or hold him.

I cried in Savannah's arms for a long time, and she patiently comforted me until I calmed down.

I looked up at her and said, "Thank you."

Savannah smiled warmly. "I've always considered you my sister. No need to thank me."

"Caroline, don't be sad anymore. Brett is very perceptive now."

I nodded, got up, and went to the bathroom to wash my face with cold water.

I washed away the tears and snot, and used cold water to reduce the swelling on my face.

Once I looked more presentable, I came out.

Luckily, they hadn't noticed anything unusual and were still watching TV, laughing.

Seeing their adorable faces made my heart ache.

But I knew I couldn't go on like this. I had to be strong so my child could come back to me.

Just then, Kathy called, her tone mysterious.

"Guess where I am?"

I sounded tired, and she immediately picked up on it. "What's wrong? Have you been crying? Who upset you?"

I said it was nothing. "Just feeling a bit down. What's up?"

"I'm in Suncrest City, wanted to surprise you."

I was taken aback. "You're back?"

It was indeed a pleasant surprise.

"I'm here on a business trip. There's a celebration in Suncrest City, and I'm here to tailor a suit for their boss. I'll be here for over a month."

"Great, we have a room ready for you. When do you land? Come stay with us."

Kathy chuckled. "I was waiting for you to say that. I've already landed and am on my way."

"Do you need Savannah to pick you up?"

"No need to trouble her. I can find my way. I've been there so many times."

I laughed. "Alright, come on over. I'll have Holly prepare a feast for you. Hope you're hungry."

Kathy's voice was full of excitement. "Of course, I'm always hungry. See you soon."

###chapter 223

After I told everyone about it, they were all thrilled and started getting ready for Kathy's arrival.

Kathy is such a likable person, it's no wonder everyone is excited to see her.

I used to be pretty reserved and didn't enjoy making friends. It was Kathy's bold and outgoing nature that broke through my social barriers, and that's how we became such good friends.

I'm always grateful for having her in my life. Sometimes I think, even though my life hasn't been perfect, I've been blessed with the best parents, the best friends, and the best kids in the world. That's more than enough for me.

Before long, Kathy arrived, driving up and eagerly hugging each of my family members.

"I missed you all so much! Did you miss me?"

I couldn't help but laugh, "You were here less than two months ago. Isn't that a bit dramatic?"

Kathy rolled her eyes at me, "Do you even know what 'absence makes the heart grow fonder' means? By that measure, it's been like two hundred years since I last saw you."

We all burst out laughing, and the atmosphere became very warm and friendly.

Kathy, ever the self-starter, grabbed her luggage and headed inside. "My room is still the same, right? You didn't change it, did you?"

I nodded helplessly, "Yes, it's still your room. No one dares to touch it. Make yourself at home."

Satisfied, Kathy nodded and pushed her suitcase into the room.

We all sat down in the living room to chat, and I asked her which client she was designing a dress for this time.

Kathy gave me a mysterious wink, "You'll never guess."

"For Alfonso and his trophy wife."

I widened my eyes, unsure which part to be shocked about first.

"Aren't you afraid of Isadora?"

"Don't worry, I asked Isadora before taking the job. She told me not to worry about her, just to focus on making money."

"Of course, I have no intention of letting those two off easy."

"I'm going to design the ugliest dress in the world for them."

"After all, his wife is just a small-town girl who doesn't know any better."

I couldn't help but laugh, "You always have a plan."

But then I realized another issue. Why would Alfonso and his wife come to Suncrest City?

They have no connections here, so why would they suddenly show up?

I asked Kathy, but she shook her head, "I don't know. They said there's some bidding project, and they're confident they'll win it. They're already planning a celebration party and wanted me to design their outfits."

"Bidding?"

I knew Alfonso's family business was also in the construction industry. In Skyview City, we were competitors, but the market was big enough that we never really clashed.

Brandon told me this after he took over. When I first started my company, Alfonso's business didn't even exist yet.

But how could there be a bidding project in Skyview City that I didn't know about?

I quickly called Asher, "Asher? What are you up to?"

"Caroline? I'm working. What's up?"

"Hey, just wanted to ask if you know about any construction projects up for bid in Suncrest City?"

"Alfonso and his family are already here. If they know about it, you should too."

"Bidding?"

Asher sounded surprised, "I haven't heard anything. Which company is it? Is it the one Mr. Sharp left you?"

"That's the only company in Suncrest City capable of attracting a company like Alfonso's."

His words made me realize something. I nodded, "Got it, Asher. I'll make some calls."

After hanging up with Asher, I called Carl in Suncrest City.

"Carl? I heard a rumor that there's a project up for bid in Suncrest City. Do you know which company it is?"

Carl was taken aback, "Caroline, your sources are impressive."

"It's our company."

"You handed over your shares to us, so we haven't had a chance to tell you. The project hasn't been officially announced yet."

"It's a national highway construction project. We were planning to open the bidding to the public soon. How did you find out? We've kept it very confidential."

I smirked, "Carl, you might want to check your senior staff. I suspect someone leaked the information."

"The bidding hasn't even started, and someone is already here, planning a celebration party. They seem very confident about winning."

"Unbelievable. Who?"

"How could they know in advance?"

I smiled and didn't hesitate to tell him, "Carl, keep an eye on Alfonso. He seems to have better sources than I do."

Carl nodded, "Got it. I'll start investigating right away."

If someone dared to leak such a high-level project, they probably weren't afraid of being caught. So, the chances of Carl finding the truth were slim. But it was still worth investigating to scare the culprit into behaving.

Meanwhile, I called Royce.

Even though I had previously turned him down, we had rekindled our friendship in Silverpeak City. He treated me like a friend.

Our relationship didn't involve romance, but it was a strong friendship.

Maintaining this status made me feel comfortable and happy.

I called Royce and asked, "Do you know about the company's bidding project?"

Royce was surprised, "I know, but we haven't had a chance to tell you. The project hasn't been officially announced yet. Did Carl tell you?"

I chuckled, "You'd never guess how I found out."

"How?"

"Alfonso and his trophy wife brought my friend Kathy here as their stylist for the celebration party."

"And the party is to celebrate winning the bid."

"I see. Someone must have leaked the information."

"I didn't even tell Asher about this project to keep it fair when the bidding opens."

"Don't worry, I'll handle it."

His voice was low and reassuring.

I knew that once he took care of something, it would be perfect.

So, I felt relieved, "Good, I trust you with this. Will you be back for the bidding?"

###chapter 224

Royce chuckled softly. "Don't sweat it, I'll be back. No way I'd miss out on this. Plus, some folks might try to pull a fast one if I'm not around."

"I'm on a business trip right now. Need anything?"

His voice, a bit raspy and crackling with static, had this oddly charming vibe.

"Nah, just come back soon."

I felt my face heat up and quickly replied.

"Got it. Hang tight."

He hung up, and I pressed my hands to my cheeks, trying to cool down.

Royce hadn't said anything inappropriate, so why was my face so hot?

I shook my head, convinced I was overthinking it.

Just then, Kathy burst into my room, looking at me in surprise. "Caroline, your face is so red! What's up?"

"Are you lovesick again?"

"Let me guess, Royce just called you."

I shot her a glare, embarrassed. "Can you knock next time before you barge in? I need my privacy, you know."

At that moment, Savannah walked in, pausing at the door when she heard my comment. She tentatively knocked on the doorframe.

"Caroline, can I come in?"

Kathy laughed loudly. "Come on in, Caroline's just embarrassed because I spilled her little secret."

"What secret?"

Savannah's eyes lit up as she looked between us.

Ever since Savannah met Kathy, her previously reserved demeanor had gradually faded, replaced by this more gossipy version.

I sighed and glared at her. Kathy said, "Mr. Castillo just called her. That's why her face is so red."

"Really?"

Savannah looked at me with curiosity. I couldn't help but throw a pillow at them. "Do you have anything important to say? If not, get out."

Savannah pulled Kathy towards the door but suddenly stopped. "Wait, I do have something important."

She turned back to me, her expression serious. "Caroline, Earl is in Suncrest City."

Her words shocked me.

I looked up at Savannah. "Really? Why is he here? Did you tell Simon and the others?"

Thankfully, Savannah was always reliable. She nodded.

"I've already informed Simon. Earl seems to have let his guard down since he realized the police aren't after him. He hasn't tried to run."

"Of course, he doesn't know that we're using his identity to catch the people behind him."

"So Simon has had someone tailing him, but no one has made a move yet."

"I ran into him at the market with Holly. He was with a heavyset guy, and they both went into a hotel."

"A heavyset guy? Did you take a picture?"

Savannah nodded and showed me a photo on her phone.

One look at the photo, and my eyes widened. I recognized the heavyset guy.

Seeing my reaction, Savannah understood immediately. "Caroline, you know this guy?"

I nodded vigorously. "Of course, I know him. He was a high school classmate and an old neighbor."

"After his dad was arrested for bribery, his family went bankrupt. But they had already moved their assets abroad."

"The last I heard, he got arrested overseas for sexual assault and was supposed to serve a few years. How the hell is he out now and back in Suncrest City?"

Savannah frowned. "The key point is that he's with Earl. They must be up to something."

"And both of them are connected to you. We need to be cautious."

I nodded. "You're right. We have to be careful."

"In high school, he pursued me. When I refused, he and some thugs cornered me in an alley near my house."

If Royce hadn't shown up and scared them off, who knows what could have happened.

My dad was furious when he found out and confronted his dad.

His dad, afraid of my dad's influence, pretended to scold him to appease my dad.

But after that, he held a grudge against me, causing small troubles like putting bugs in my desk or spilling water on my books.

I stopped caring after a while since we were close to graduation, and it seemed pointless to make a fuss.

After graduation, his family fell apart.

"Caroline, give me his name. I'll have Simon look into him."

"Okay, his name is Lowell Warren."

Savannah noted the name and left.

I lay on my bed, deep in thought. Why had Lowell suddenly returned, and why now?

I suddenly remembered the bidding event we had just discussed.

It seemed like there might be a connection between the two events, but the details were too tangled for me to figure out.

I hadn't forgotten that Alfonso and Brandon used to be on good terms until Brandon's bankruptcy caused a rift.

But in the world of business, there are no permanent enemies. It's possible they could collaborate again for mutual benefit.

I just couldn't see what common interest they might have.

I pondered over it repeatedly but couldn't make sense of it.

Just then, Carl called to tell me the highway project had been approved and they were preparing to open it for bids. He asked if I would attend the bidding event in two weeks.

I thought for a moment and nodded.

"I'll go, but don't announce my attendance. I plan to go incognito."

Carl quickly understood my intention.

Unexpectedly, Alfonso called me, asking to meet.

I was incredulous. "You? Why do you want to meet?"

"I know Ms. Sharp is a shareholder in Suncrest City Building Materials Company, so I'd like to discuss our advantages with you."

I didn't hesitate to refuse. "I don't think that's necessary. You were friends with Brandon, and now that I'm divorced from him, it would be awkward."

"Besides, it's the bidding period. It wouldn't look good if we were seen together. Let's not meet."

"I just want to discuss some personal matters with Ms. Sharp. In business, there are no permanent enemies. Brandon and I have fallen out, and whatever happens between us is separate from my dealings with you."

###chapter 225

His voice was relentless, like he wouldn't stop until I agreed to meet him.

Listening to him felt like being watched by a snake in the dark, its slimy tongue flicking out, ready to extort something from me.

"It's just tea, Ms. Sharp. Is that such a big deal?"

I thought for a moment, then nodded. "Fine, if you want to meet, we'll meet. But you know this is a sensitive time with the bidding process. Our meeting must be kept secret from the other bidders."

"And I won't give you any special treatment. Even though I'm the largest shareholder of the company, my shares are held in trust, so the decision-making power isn't mine."

"I understand. Don't worry, I just want to chat."

The more he said that, the more suspicious I became. Alfonso and I had no personal connection. What could we possibly have to chat about?

Alfonso and I arranged to meet at ten o'clock the next morning at a discreet restaurant.

Since I decided to go, I had to protect myself.

I haven't been living for myself for a long time. I live for my children, my family, and my friends.

So, I immediately called Royce. He seemed busy and hadn't returned yet. When I called, he hung up.

Royce must have had something urgent; otherwise, he would never hang up on me.

Sure enough, he called back within two minutes. "What's up? I was in a meeting."

"Alfonso wants to meet. He says he wants to discuss personal matters."

Royce paused for a moment. "Did you agree?"

"Yes, he was very insistent and difficult to deal with, so I had no choice."

"Alright, just remember to take Savannah with you. I'll also arrange for a few people to be nearby."

"Do you know what Alfonso wants?"

"No idea. He's a very unpredictable person, known for being hard to read in Skyview City. No one can guess his next move."

"And he's someone who won't stop until he gets what he wants, so I'm a bit worried about you."

I nodded. "I told him I wouldn't discuss work or give him any special treatment, but he still insisted on meeting to talk about personal matters."

"I don't understand what personal matters we could have, but it seems important, so I have to..."

"Then go. Don't worry, no matter what happens, I'll help you handle it."

I started coughing violently, caught off guard by Royce's words.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing, just choked on some water."

My cheeks must have turned red. If Savannah and Kathy had seen, they would have teased me endlessly.

"Be careful. How are you still like a child?"

"Who's a child? I'm thirty years old."

"Really? To me, you haven't changed a bit since high school."

That was an insult to my years of business experience. After all these years as a boss, he still saw me as a naive kid.

"Cut it out. I'm not that kid anymore."

I hung up the phone.

After calming down, I went to find Savannah.

I told her about the lunch meeting with Alfonso the next day.

Savannah nodded seriously. "I know. Mr. Castillo called to remind me to ensure your safety."

"Don't worry, Caroline. I won't let anything happen to you."

I was taken aback by her seriousness. "Did Royce scold you?"

She shook her head. "No, Mr. Castillo didn't scold me, but he was very serious about protecting you and not letting our friendship affect my duty."

I couldn't help but feel helpless. Royce was really...

I patted Savannah's shoulder. "Don't overthink it. Royce is just tough on the outside but soft on the inside. He didn't mean anything by it. And remember, to me, you're like a sister."

Savannah nodded. "I know. Mr. Castillo made me realize that even though I see you as my sister, I must take my duty seriously."

"Because I see you as my sister, I have to be even more diligent."

I nodded helplessly. "Alright, but don't be too tense. We're like family, and I don't see any problem with you."

Leaving Savannah's room, I returned to my own.

Lowell, Earl, Alfonso-these seemingly unrelated people all appeared in Suncrest City at the same time, making me wonder if something was going on.

But when I tried to dig deeper, it was like a fog I couldn't see through, no matter how hard I tried.

I didn't know what lay beneath the fog. Maybe a monster with fangs, ready to devour us. Or a bottomless abyss, ready to shatter us to pieces.

Either way, I had to take it seriously.

I sighed and went to my father's grave in the back hills.

The scenery here was always the same, year-round. My dad loved it, so we chose this as his final resting place.

Kelly also said she wanted to be buried here with Gerald when her time came.

I sat by Gerald's grave, pouring a bottle of wine onto the ground. "Dad, I'm so tired. I wish you were here."

"I've been through so much lately, so much that my heart is heavy with sorrow. There's no one to talk to, and even if I did, it would only burden them."

"So I can only talk to you."

I recounted everything that had happened, like a diary.

Strangely, I didn't feel heartache. With each story, it felt like I was releasing something long blocked, leaving me with a sense of relief.

When I finished, I felt a sudden clarity.

At that moment, a leaf drifted down from the sky, landing on my wrist and staying there.

I looked at the leaf, surprised. "Dad, are you comforting me?"

The leaf seemed to move, as if responding.

Tears welled up in my eyes. I clutched the leaf tightly and began to cry.

###chapter 226

After leaving Gerald's grave, I felt an inexplicable surge of courage, knowing it was a gift from my father.

He made me fearless.

I went back home and had a good night's sleep. The next day, I was full of energy, ready to meet Alfonso for lunch at the place he had suggested.

When I arrived, Alfonso was already waiting for me in a private room.

He smiled slightly when he saw me.

"Hey, Ms. Sharp, long time no see."

I nodded and shook his hand.

I sat down and noticed the table was already filled with various dishes.

In front of me was a steaming plate of steak.

"Brandon once told me you like your steak well-done, so I ordered it especially for you."

"This restaurant has great food. I've only been in Suncrest City for a few days, but I've already fallen in love with it."

He gestured for me to try the food.

I shook my head. "I'm not hungry. Just tell me what you want to say."

"Do you want to talk about personal matters?"

"As far as I know, we don't have much of a personal relationship. Are you here to talk about Brandon?"

Alfonso didn't seem offended. He shook his head slightly. "Of course not. Why would I waste my time on a loser like him?"

"But what I want to discuss with you does involve him. I wonder if you're interested."

I shook my head decisively. "Sorry, but Brandon and I are divorced. I don't want to know anything about him."

"Marrying him was the biggest mistake of my life."

"Ms. Sharp, don't be angry. I'm sure you'll want to hear what I have to say next."

I was skeptical. I couldn't believe Alfonso had any news that would interest me.

I hadn't forgotten Royce's assessment of him-willing to do anything for his own gain.

So I couldn't trust anything he said. Better not to listen, not to know, not to trouble myself.

"What makes you so sure I want to hear what you have to say?"

"Mr. Carr, you're being too arrogant."

"If there's nothing else, I'll be leaving."

I grabbed my bag and stood up to go.

Just as my hand touched the door handle, I heard Alfonso's calm voice behind me.

"I heard your child was kidnapped in Silverpeak City recently?"

I froze, my steps halting.

I turned back, looking at him with a sarcastic smile. "Your information is quite up-to-date. You even know about that?"

"But I suggest you focus on your own company and stop prying into other people's family matters."

"It's not that I want to know, but some information just comes to me."

"Two years ago, when Brandon and I were drinking, he revealed a secret to me. A shocking secret."

To be honest, my curiosity was piqued by his dramatic buildup.

I had to admit, Alfonso was a good storyteller.

But I still didn't believe he had any real secrets.

"Keep your secret. I don't want to hear it."

I gripped the handle and opened the door. Just as I stepped out, I heard him say, "Your child was switched?"

That stopped me in my tracks. I had to look back at him.

Alfonso's face showed a subtle smugness, a look of having everything under control.

It annoyed me, this feeling of being manipulated by him, but I had no choice.

"How do you know?"

"Brandon told me when he was drunk."

"I've kept it in my heart all these years, never daring to forget."

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms without feeling the pain.

"What exactly do you know?"

He picked up his wine glass, swirling it gently before taking a sip.

"Nothing much, just the whereabouts of your child."

"Brandon, of all people, chose to tell me this secret instead of his own wife."

I couldn't help but grit my teeth. It was a bitter irony.

Brandon could reveal such a secret to a stranger, but never mentioned it to me in all these years.

It only showed how little I meant to him.

Seeing my angry expression, Alfonso raised an eyebrow. "Ms. Sharp, do you want to know? I can tell you."

"What's the catch?"

He leaned back, crossing his legs.

"Dealing with smart people is always easier. I'll be straightforward. Your company is currently bidding on a project, right? I want that project."

"If I win the bid, I'll give you your child's location immediately, no delays."

I knew Alfonso's invitation had to be related to this project.

I gritted my teeth. "You know that's impossible."

"The decision isn't mine to make."

"As far as I know, the company's second-largest shareholder is Mr. Castillo, right? That gentleman is quite impressive and seems to have a close relationship with you. High school classmates, if I'm not mistaken?"

I was slightly surprised. I hadn't expected Alfonso to know so much about me.

I felt again the depth of his scheming, as Royce had warned.

"Yes, so what?"

"Just a few words from you to Royce, and the project will be mine."

"You know, for Ms. Sharp, this is a simple task."

"But it can get you the whereabouts of your own child. Isn't that worth it?"

I sneered. "Do you know how much that project is worth? Over two billion dollars. Can you handle that, Alfonso?"

"That's not for Ms. Sharp to worry about. Just say a few good words for me."

I felt a wave of dizziness. Looking at Alfonso's smug face, I wanted to tear that smile off.

I knew I couldn't do that. If he knew my child's location, he could pose a threat at any time.

If I angered him, the consequences would be unbearable.

But I couldn't hand this project to Alfonso.

"Let me think about it. This isn't a small matter. I need time to consider."

"I'll be waiting for your response, Ms. Sharp."

He stood up, straightening his suit, and waved at me.

I didn't look back, just turned and walked out.

As I closed the door, I stumbled.

Savannah rushed to support me. "What's wrong, Caroline? Did that bastard do something to you?"

"Tell me, and I'll go deal with him right now."

She was about to storm into the private room.

I quickly grabbed her hand, shaking my head wearily.

"Let's get out of here. He didn't do anything. I'll explain later."

Seeing my state, Savannah frowned and helped me to the car.

###chapter 227

"What's going on, Caroline? Spill it, don't leave me hanging."

My face was pale, and I bit my lip hard. "Alfonso... he knows where my kid is."

Savannah's eyes widened immediately.

"How does he know? Is it true?"

"I don't know. He said Brandon told him when he was drunk."

"But Alfonso wouldn't dare use this to threaten me for the highway project unless it was true."

"Dammit, I'm going in there to kill that bastard right now."

Savannah, in a fit of rage, was about to storm into the restaurant.

I quickly grabbed her arm and shook my head. "Don't provoke him. If he really knows where my kid is, he could do anything. We have to play it cool."

Savannah clenched her teeth, realizing the gravity of the situation. "So, what do we do? Let Alfonso threaten us? Give him the highway project? We can't let that scumbag win."

I nodded. "Don't worry, I have a plan. Call Royce."

Savannah nodded and dialed Royce's number, then handed me the phone.

"Royce."

My voice was filled with panic, and he picked up on it immediately.

"What's wrong? Did something happen?"

Royce's voice was urgent. "Caroline, you're scaring me."

"Alfonso knows where my missing kid is. He said Brandon told him when he was drunk."

"He's using it to blackmail me into giving him the highway project."

As I said this, I felt my vision blur and my heart race uncontrollably.

My hand shook, and I didn't hear what Royce said next. The phone slipped from my grasp and fell into the car.

Everything went black, and I passed out.

The last thing I remembered was Savannah's frantic shouting.

When I woke up, the hospital room was empty.

I was momentarily confused, then the memories came flooding back.

My heart had raced so fast that I had fainted.

Just then, Royce walked in with a cup of warm water.

He saw me and his eyes softened. "You're awake? Here, drink some water."

I looked at him in surprise. "How did you get here? Weren't you on a business trip?"

Royce sighed. "You scared me to death. The call went dead, and Savannah told me you passed out. I had her take you to the hospital while I rushed over."

"I couldn't get here any faster."

I took the cup from him and smiled weakly. "Sorry for the trouble."

He brushed a thumb across my lips. "Don't smile. If you need to cry, just cry."

His words broke the dam, and I started sobbing uncontrollably.

Royce pulled me into his arms, letting me cry on his shoulder.

I buried my face in his neck, feeling utterly broken.

"Royce, what do we do? Why did Alfonso have to find out? If he threatens my kid's safety, what can I do?"

"Do I have no choice but to give him the highway project?"

"I don't want to give in."

I cried for a long time.

Royce patiently listened, his hand gently rubbing my back.

"It's okay, remember what I said? I'm here for you."

I gradually stopped crying and looked at him, sniffling. "What do we do? Do we really have to give in to Alfonso?"

He smiled gently. "Who said that?"

"I haven't had a chance to tell you, but I've been investigating the child's whereabouts. I have a lead."

My eyes lit up as I looked at Royce. "Really?"

"Yes. I've been looking into it. Karen had close contact with someone from a fishing village around the time you gave birth."

"I suspect she might have taken your child there. But there are hundreds of fishing villages near Skyview City, each with children who have been trafficked, adopted, or fostered. We have to check each one."

"It will take time, which is why I didn't tell you earlier."

"But now Simon has provided a description of the child's features. I'm confident we'll find him."

I stared at Royce, stunned by his words.

He wiped away my tears with his thumb. "What's wrong? Are you in shock or just happy?"

"I told you I'd help you find your child. When have I ever broken a promise?"

A surge of emotion welled up inside me.

I suddenly leaned forward and kissed Royce hard on the lips. "Thank you."

Royce was taken aback, seemingly unable to believe what I had just done.

I had kissed him so forcefully that I had cut his lip, and it was bleeding.

His eyes darkened, and he grabbed the back of my neck to kiss me again.

Just then, there was a knock on the door.

The intimate moment was interrupted, and Royce sighed deeply, letting go of my neck. "Come in."

Savannah walked in, holding some papers.

"Mr. Castillo, the doctor said Caroline fainted from extreme stress. She just needs to rest and avoid getting too upset."

She then noticed I was awake and looked surprised. "Caroline, you're awake?"

"Why were you crying?"

I wiped my tears and turned away, embarrassed by the blood on Royce's lip.

Savannah didn't seem to notice the tension between us. "Caroline, don't worry. We'll find your child. Trust Royce."

"We won't let Alfonso get away with this. He'll pay for what he's done."

Royce sighed deeply. "Did you come in just to say that?"

Savannah looked confused. "Didn't you ask me to check with the doctor?"

For the first time, I saw a look of exasperation on Royce's face. He usually had everything under control, so this was surprising.

I couldn't help but laugh. "Alright, since I'm fine, let's get out of here before my mom finds out."

"How long was I out?"

"Five hours. Don't worry, I've arranged everything at home. Kathy is covering for you, saying you're out with friends and might be home late."

I nodded, relieved that Kathy was there.

"Are you done?"

Royce suddenly asked, looking directly at Savannah.

###chapter 228

"Are you done, Mr. Castillo? Anything else?"

"If you're done, get out."

Royce lifted his chin, his voice cold.

I knew what Royce was planning, and my face flushed. I couldn't help but grab the blanket, feeling a bit nervous.

I silently mocked myself. I'm a mother of three, yet I still get butterflies like this?

"Why? Caroline just woke up. I should stay..."

She didn't finish her sentence because Royce's icy glare was too obvious. She shrank back and walked out.

Savannah left the room, closing the door behind her.

Royce's gaze was fixed on me, the implication in his eyes clear.

I felt embarrassed and avoided his gaze, looking down.

The cut on his lip was too noticeable to ignore.

"You're hurt. Do you want to clean it up?"

I coughed lightly and spoke softly.

Royce wiped his lip with his thumb. He was undeniably a very mature man. Every move he made exuded an innate elegance and nobility.

This was a quality Brandon could never imitate.

"It's nothing, doesn't interfere with anything."

His words were heavily suggestive, making my face turn even redder.

I shrank back, unable to meet his gaze.

But he reached out, turning my face towards him, leaning in closer.

I nervously closed my eyes, my eyelashes trembling.

I could feel his breath on my face, warm and ticklish.

Just as I felt the warmth of his lips, the phone by the bed rang.

Royce frowned. I instinctively reached for the phone, but he grabbed my hand. "Ignore it."

I glanced at the caller ID. It was Kathy.

"If I don't answer, she'll keep calling. You know how persistent Kathy is."

Royce cursed under his breath, sitting back with a displeased expression.

Feeling a bit awkward, I picked up the phone.

"Kathy?"

"Thank God you're awake! How could you just faint like that?"

"That damn Brandon, he's definitely going to hell."

"Don't worry, your mom doesn't suspect a thing. Do you need me to come see you?"

I quickly said no. "I'll be heading home soon. Let's talk more when I get back."

"Alright, hurry back."

After hanging up, I looked at Royce, feeling a bit uneasy. "I should head home."

He sighed deeply. "Let's go."

Seeing his helpless expression, I couldn't help but smile secretly. I actually enjoyed seeing this side of Royce, the one who couldn't always get his way.

He helped me pack my things while I changed out of the hospital gown in the bathroom. We headed downstairs and got into the car.

Savannah was in the driver's seat, and Royce and I sat in the back.

Royce must have rescheduled a lot to come here. As soon as we got in the car, he started taking calls non-stop, his expression growing more serious.

"Alright, I understand. I'll be back tomorrow. Handle things there for now."

I watched his furrowed brow. "You're leaving tomorrow?"

"Yes, there's still some unfinished business in Skyview City. I'll head back tomorrow."

"I'll call you once I have news, and you can come back too."

I nodded, understanding what he meant by "news."

Royce had been working hard to find this child. If I didn't recognize his feelings for me now, I'd be too heartless.

That's why I made the move today, responding to Royce's feelings.

I whispered, "Thank you."

He smiled gently, patting my head.

"It's nothing."

I looked up and saw Savannah glancing at us through the rearview mirror, her expression gossipy.

Feeling embarrassed, I quickly pulled away from Royce.

Royce seemed to notice too, giving Savannah a warning look.

She immediately focused on the road, not daring to look back.

When we arrived at my house, Kathy was waiting at the door.

She rushed over as soon as she saw me. "You're finally back! Do you know how worried I was? Why did you faint?"

"Weren't you meeting Alfonso today? Did he hit you?"

Her barrage of questions left me a bit helpless. "Which one do you want me to answer first?"

"Let's go inside first, okay?"

Kathy finally realized and led us inside.

On the way, Kathy kept glancing at Royce curiously.

"When did you get here?"

Royce was still annoyed about Kathy interrupting him at the hospital, his expression cold.

"Just now. He was at the hospital the whole time."

I asked Savannah to take Royce to the living room while I pulled Kathy into her room.

I knew some things needed to be said privately.

"What's going on?"

"You're fully recovered now. Why did you faint?"

"Because Alfonso threatened me."

"Threatened you? He doesn't have anything on you. How could he threaten you?"

"Do you remember when we came back from Silverpeak City, and I was holding Aria?"

"Yes, what about it?"

"I found out a secret at the hospital in Silverpeak City. Aria isn't my biological child. She was switched at birth."

Kathy's eyes widened in disbelief.

"How is that possible? Did Brandon do it?"

I nodded. "His whole family, and Karen was involved too."

"That whole family is awful. If Karen were still alive, I'd slap her."

"Getting worse with age."

She cursed angrily but then realized something. "Wait, who else knows about this?"

My expression froze. I knew Kathy would pick up on this.

"Savannah, Royce, Simon."

"They all know."

Kathy's face turned angry.

"So everyone knew? Except me?"

"Caroline, you kept this from me? Do you even consider me a friend?"

I sighed. I knew Kathy would be upset. I was prepared for this when I decided to keep it from her.

"I didn't mean to hide it from you. Do you know why I'm still raising Aria? Because I've grown attached to her."

"But I was afraid you wouldn't support me. I was afraid you'd want me to send her away because she's Brandon's child with another woman."

"I was afraid of your reaction, so I didn't tell you, Kathy."

"I didn't mean to keep it from you."

###chapter 229

Kathy's face turned even angrier at my words.

"Caroline, what do you take me for?"

"Do you think I wouldn't support you?"

I quickly stepped forward and hugged her. "I really messed up. I didn't mean to hide it from you. I realized something was off and wanted to come clean, but I couldn't find the right moment. It felt weird to bring it up out of nowhere, so I didn't say anything."

Kathy pushed me away in anger. "Get up. I don't need a friend who hides things from me."

Seeing her genuine anger, I held onto her tightly. "I was wrong, Kathy. I shouldn't have kept it from you. I messed up big time. Please forgive me?"

Kathy let out a cold snort. "Why should I forgive you? You hid this from me. You didn't treat me like a friend at all. Do I even need to forgive you?"

With that, she pushed me away and got up to leave.

I fell back onto the bed, panicking as I saw her about to walk out. "Kathy, I'm feeling really dizzy."

Sure enough, Kathy stopped and turned to look at me.

I quickly lay back on the bed. "I'm so dizzy. I can't take it."

Kathy watched me for a moment, then reluctantly came over. "Do you need me to call a doctor?"

I covered my forehead, not saying a word. Kathy's expression grew serious as she saw I wasn't faking it. "Are you serious, Caroline? Are you really dizzy?"

I didn't respond, just held my head and closed my eyes, looking very uncomfortable.

"What's going on? Didn't you just get back from the hospital? Did the doctor give you any medication for dizziness?"

She started rummaging through my bag. I took the opportunity to grab her hand and sincerely apologize. "Kathy, I really messed up."

"If I had to choose the most important friend in the world, it would definitely be you."

"I didn't hide it from you on purpose. I know I shouldn't have. I wanted to tell you, but there was never a good time. I didn't know how to bring it up..."

"The more I thought about it, the weirder it seemed."

"But not telling you doesn't mean you're not important to me. You're my most important friend. Please don't be mad at me."

She stood with her back to me, not moving. I tugged at her hand. "Kathy?"

After a moment, she turned around, looking at me with a mix of frustration and concern. "Get up. Are you faking it?"

Seeing her expression, I knew she had calmed down. I quickly nodded and got up from the bed.

"I'm fine now. I'm not dizzy anymore, see?"

I said, bouncing a little on the bed. But to my surprise, the bouncing made me really dizzy.

I quickly held my head. "No, no, I'm really dizzy this time."

Kathy looked at me with exasperation and helped me up.

"Don't hide things from me again, got it?"

I nodded immediately. "Don't worry, from now on, I'll tell you everything first. I won't hide anything from you."

Kathy seemed amused by my words and rolled her eyes.

"Now tell me, what's going on with Alfonso?"

I recounted what happened in the private room today. Kathy was so angry she slapped her thigh.

"Brandon is such a jerk, sending his own child away."

"Letting Alfonso know is like handing his child over as a hostage."

Seeing her animated expression, I couldn't help but smile.

"Don't worry, Royce already told me at the hospital that he's found some leads on the child. It just needs a bit more time. He'll contact me as soon as he has news."

Kathy suddenly looked at me suspiciously. "Wait, when you mentioned the hospital, your eyes flashed. Did something happen between you and Royce at the hospital?"

"No, nothing happened."

I couldn't help but give her a little shove.

But Kathy kept looking at me. "And when Royce came in earlier, his lip was busted. How does a guy bust his lip for no reason? Unless someone else did it."

"What did you two do at the hospital?"

I had to admire Kathy's detective skills. Her intuition about gossip was spot on.

I had to admit, it was a talent. Even Savannah didn't notice what happened between Royce and me at the hospital.

"Nothing happened. Don't tell Savannah anything."

I rolled my eyes at her and left her room.

In the living room, Kelly was chatting with Royce on the couch.

Royce sat upright, looking very serious.

"Caroline, how did you end up coming back with Royce?"

"We just ran into each other. He said he hadn't seen you in a while and wanted to come back with me to see you."

Royce's face was full of apology. "Mrs. Sharp, I'm really sorry. I came in such a hurry this time, so I didn't prepare much. Please forgive me."

Hearing this, I looked at the coffee table and saw it was filled with gift boxes.

There were high-end cashmere coats, tea, imported fruits, and more...

I was stunned, looking at Royce in disbelief.

He had been with me the whole time. When did he buy all this?

And he called this unprepared? This was more than prepared.

Kathy went through the items and sat on the couch.

"This is unprepared? Anyone would think you're here to propose to Caroline."

I glared at Kathy, signaling her to stop talking nonsense.

Royce smiled. "No, these are just small tokens of my appreciation for Mrs. Sharp."

Kathy smiled warmly. "Royce, you always bring so many things. It's too much. Next time, don't bring anything, okay?"

"If you bring something next time, I'll pay you back."

"I'll hold onto the money for this time."

Royce quickly waved his hands. "No, no, Mrs. Sharp. I have to go now. I have some things to take care of. Please don't be so formal with me."

He stood up to leave, and my mom gave me a look, signaling me to see him out.

I had no choice but to get up and walk Royce to the door. A car was already waiting for him at the end of the alley. He must really have something urgent, or he wouldn't leave so quickly.

I looked at him curiously. "When did you prepare all this? I had no idea."

Royce smiled helplessly. "When you were unconscious, I asked Savannah to go downstairs and buy them for me. I put them in the car's trunk. I couldn't come empty-handed, could I?"

"Mrs. Sharp wouldn't be happy about that."

"You overthink it. She likes you a lot. She wouldn't mind if you came empty-handed."

"That's different. The past is the past, and now is now."

###chapter 230

"What do you mean by 'before and now'?"

His words were so cryptic that I couldn't quite understand.

"Things are different now. Before, I could just show up empty-handed, but not anymore."

I finally got what he meant, and my face turned bright red.

I gave him a playful shove. "What are you talking about? Just go already."

But he didn't budge. Instead, he grabbed the hand I used to push him.

His thumb gently stroked my wrist.

A jolt of electricity ran through my body, starting from my wrist.

"I have to head back to Skyview City tomorrow. I still need to visit another city today. Don't worry, I'll find the kid."

I nodded. "I know. Thanks for everything you're doing."

"You really don't have to do all this."

He sighed softly. "But it's your problem."

His words made my heart race.

He glanced at his watch. "I gotta go. You should head back."

I nodded and stood still. He took a few steps forward, then suddenly turned back and kissed my forehead.

"See you."

I touched my damp forehead and watched Royce's retreating figure, my face turning even redder.

After he got in the car, I couldn't see him through the rear window, but I could feel his eyes lingering on me.

I waved, and the car paused for a moment before driving away.

When I turned around, I saw Savannah and Kathy crouching sneakily by the door.

I felt a wave of embarrassment. How did they catch me?

Resigned, I walked over to face their curious stares.

Kathy waggled her eyebrows at me. "What's going on with you and Royce?"

"Are you two together?"

"I saw him kiss you. Even if it was just on the forehead, friends don't kiss like that."

"When's the wedding? I want to be a bridesmaid."

Savannah immediately raised her hand. "I want to be a bridesmaid too."

"I haven't even thought about it. What are you guys doing?"

I couldn't help but push them away and went inside to escape their prying eyes.

"Haven't thought about it? Looks like you're almost ready to marry him."

Kathy mimicked my voice sarcastically, laughing.

I sighed helplessly and flopped onto my bed.

To be honest, I wasn't worried about Alfonso's threats anymore because I knew Royce would handle everything.

I didn't know where my trust in Royce came from, maybe from his consistent reliability.

In any case, I trusted him unconditionally now, without any reason.

A few days passed, and there were only about ten days left until the bidding meeting.

Alfonso finally called me again, his tone as indifferent as before. "Ms. Sharp, have you made up your mind? Will you give up your child or award the project to me?"

I steeled my thoughts. "Shouldn't you give me more time to consider? This project isn't a small matter. How could I decide in just a few days?"

Alfonso chuckled. "I understand. I'm not calling to rush you, Ms. Sharp. I just wanted to update you on your child's condition."

My heart tightened, and I gripped the phone tightly, staying silent.

"Your child seems to have a seafood allergy. It's a shame, really. Someone from Skyview City who can't eat seafood is missing out on one of life's great pleasures."

His words confirmed my suspicion that he had my child.

He was also subtly threatening me. If I didn't give him the bid by the deadline, he would harm my child.

So Royce only had about ten days left.

My heart tightened, and I couldn't help but feel anxious.

But I didn't show any emotion on the surface and snorted. "How do I know you're telling the truth?"

"What if you're just making this up to trick me? Neither Brandon nor I are allergic to seafood."

"Who knows? Two people without seafood allergies having a child who is allergic-how interesting."

"That's the wonder of genetics. It only has two combinations but can produce infinite possibilities."

"Whether you believe me or not, that's all I have to say."

"There are ten days left until the bidding meeting. I'll be waiting for your good news, Ms. Sharp."

After he hung up, I couldn't help but throw the phone to the ground in frustration.

"That bastard is openly threatening me now."

But there was nothing I could do except wait for Royce to find a lead.

This feeling of helplessness was overwhelming.

Just then, Kathy pushed open my door. "Alfonso's mistress asked me to go measure her for a dress. Do you want to come with me?"

My eyebrows twitched, and I immediately nodded. "I'll go."

I got into Kathy's car, and we drove to the hotel where Alfonso and Aurelia were staying.

As soon as we entered the hotel room, Aurelia looked surprised to see me.

She extended her hand towards me. "Ms. Sharp, long time no see. I haven't seen you since your divorce."

I couldn't help but scoff. "Really? It seems Ms. Kingsley is very interested in my personal affairs."

"Everyone in Skyview City knows. I'm no exception."

"By the way, Ms. Sharp, why are you here?"

I glanced at Kathy, remembering how Aurelia had been giving her a hard time since hiring her.

I was here to support Kathy and to see if I could find any information about my child.

After all, Aurelia wasn't very bright.

"Kathy is my friend. I'm planning to have dinner with her after she's done. Please hurry, Ms. Kingsley."

Aurelia's smile stiffened, and she quickly nodded. "Alright, Kathy, let's get this done quickly."

Her voice softened as she stood in front of the mirror. "The pattern you made last time was still a bit big. Can you make the waist smaller and the hips wider?"

Kathy replied expressionlessly, "Ms. Kingsley, I always make the patterns to fit you perfectly. But if you keep slimming your waist and filling your hips after I make the pattern, how am I supposed to finish?"

"If I don't finish, Mr. Carr will hold me accountable."

Aurelia's face changed, and she glanced at me awkwardly.

"What are you talking about? I've just lost some weight, and my hips are from working out. I didn't get any injections."

"Fine, just follow this pattern. I'll try to control myself."

Her eyes were already burning with anger, but she couldn't lash out with me there, so she gritted her teeth and spoke.

Kathy quickly finished measuring her. "All done, Ms. Kingsley."

###chapter 231

I wanted to ask Aurelia about the kid, to see if Alfonso had mentioned anything to her.

But seeing her clueless expression, I changed my mind. I was sure Alfonso wouldn't tell her anything. Maybe he was with her because she was so naive.

If I asked her casually, she might tell Alfonso, and that would be trouble.

I stood up and nodded. "Ms. Kingsley, can we head out now?"

Aurelia nodded, her smile stiff. "Let's go. See you later, Ms. Sharp."

I nodded back, not even looking at her, and pulled Kathy along as we left.

We found a random restaurant near the hotel to grab lunch.

At the table, Kathy couldn't help but vent. "You should've seen Aurelia's face, she was so frustrated."

"Now I know, not all money is worth earning."

"I've put up with so much from Aurelia these past few days. One moment she says my design isn't good enough and makes me redo it, the next she wants it back to the original version."

"With her small chest and big butt, she looks like a gorilla walking from a distance no matter what she wears."

I laughed at her description. Kathy must have been holding in a lot of frustration these past few days, and now she was letting it all out.

"I'll go with you to see her next time, okay?"

"No need, you have your own things to do. Besides, I think you coming with me today scared her enough. She won't dare say anything to me next time."

"Having a reliable friend is a thousand times better than any man, right?"

I couldn't help but chuckle.

After lunch, as we were walking out, I spotted a familiar figure across the street.

Though I couldn't see his face clearly, his build reminded me of what Savannah had told me a few days ago-Lowell.

I froze and instinctively pulled Kathy into a nearby alley.

She looked at me, puzzled. "What's wrong?"

I shook my head. "I saw Lowell."

"Him? That jerk is back? I thought he was in prison overseas?"

Everyone at school knew about Lowell bullying me in high school, and Kathy was no exception.

She was one of the few who stood up for me, even though it made us both targets of Lowell's revenge.

But Kathy had a big heart and didn't mind it.

"Yeah, Savannah told me recently that Lowell is back and hanging out with Earl."

"What?"

"There's definitely something fishy going on. How could two people with no connection be together? They seem like they're from different worlds."

I nodded. "Exactly. We don't know how they got together, so we need to be cautious. Avoid him if we can."

When we peeked out again, Lowell was gone. I breathed a sigh of relief and was about to pull Savannah away when Lowell suddenly appeared right in front of us, walking straight towards us.

Kathy and I were startled and turned to leave.

Luckily, he was too overweight to catch up with us.

But we weren't sure if he had seen us clearly or if it was just a coincidence.

Either way, we needed to avoid him.

We went back to the restaurant, pretending to look for something we had left behind.

While I pretended to search the table, Kathy kept an eye on the door.

Fortunately, Lowell only lingered at the door for a moment before turning away.

We relaxed and were about to leave the restaurant when Kathy suddenly pointed in horror at a mirror by the side.

This trendy restaurant had a mirror at the entrance for people to take photos.

In the mirror, we saw Lowell's reflection. He hadn't left; he was standing right there, blocking our way.

Cold sweat broke out all over me.

I signaled to Kathy and led her to the back door.

We quickly left the restaurant and took a cab home.

That close call had me shaken. I didn't know why Lowell was stalking us, but it was terrifying. Thankfully, we avoided any confrontation.

With seven days left until the bidding event, Alfonso called me again.

"Ms. Sharp, how are you?"

I was getting impatient. "Mr. Carr, you're being too pushy. I need time to think this over seriously. You can't keep calling to rush me."

"I understand. I just wanted to share that the child cried today, quite loudly. Seems like they have a future as a singer."

I knew he was threatening me again. I gritted my teeth. "I'll do my best to help you, but I need more time. Can you give me two days?"

"Of course, Ms. Sharp. I've never rushed you."

I scoffed and hung up.

Alfonso had been calling me frequently, dropping hints. I passed all the information to Royce to help him find the child.

Five days before the bidding event, Royce called me.

"We have a lead. Can you come to Skyview City? Don't let Alfonso know."

I felt a surge of hope and quickly told Savannah, "Savannah, I need to go to Skyview City. Please cover for me and don't let anyone know I'm gone."

"If Alfonso finds out I'm in Skyview City, he'll know I'm looking for the child and might move them. I have to go alone."

Savannah understood the seriousness but looked worried.

"What if something happens to you?"

I waved her off. "Don't worry, nothing will happen. I'll be discreet, and no one will know I'm there."

"If we tell anyone, that's when problems arise."

"Besides, Royce is in Skyview City. What are you worried about?"

Savannah nodded. "Alright, let me know when you land safely."

I nodded. "I will."

After saying goodbye to my family, I boarded the helicopter Royce had sent and headed to Skyview City that night.

When I landed, I couldn't help but feel excited. Royce wouldn't lie to me. If he said there was a lead, then there must be solid information about my child.

Royce picked me up at the landing site.

I looked at him anxiously. "Where's the child?"

He said, "Don't rush. Let's go back and rest first."

###chapter 232

I couldn't help but feel a bit anxious. How could I possibly rest in this state?

I just wanted to see my child as soon as possible.

Royce seemed to sense my urgency. He grabbed my hand and gave it a firm squeeze. "Hey, don't worry. I've got this."

"How are you gonna find your kid if you don't get some rest?"

"These next few days are crucial. You need to take care of yourself."

Hearing him say that, I could only nod in agreement.

Royce was right. I hadn't slept much on the plane because I was too excited, thinking about seeing my child soon.

But in reality, Royce only said he had a lead, not that he had found my child.

I trusted him too much.

I sighed helplessly and let him lead me to the car.

Royce drove us to the entrance of a large estate.

I stared at the big house in the distance, stunned. "Royce, is this your place?"

Royce nodded. He parked the car in the underground garage and helped me out.

"Why do you need such a big house if you live alone?"

As far as I knew, Royce's family wasn't around, and he usually kept to himself.

Why buy such a big house?

Royce chuckled softly. "There will be more people living here in the future. I had to get a bigger place."

I looked at him, puzzled. "What do you mean by that?"

He turned to me. "When we have more kids, we can't have them all crammed into one room, can we?"

I suddenly understood what he meant, and my face turned red.

I mumbled, "What do you mean by 'more kids'? What does that have to do with you?"

But Royce didn't hear me. He pulled me inside the estate.

He led me to a room. "You rest here. I'll be in the room next door."

"I'll tell you what I found out tomorrow after you wake up."

I shook my head. "Tell me a little now, or I won't be able to sleep."

I clasped my hands together, pleading. "Please, Royce, just give me a hint."

He sighed. "Alright, I'll tell you."

"I found out that Karen bought a property before she passed away. It's now under Earl's name."

"So what?"

"She bought it the year you had your child, and it's near the fishing village."

My eyes lit up. "So my child might be in that property?"

Royce nodded. "It's very possible. But we need to go there to find out. That's why I want you to sleep early. It's a long drive, and it'll be tiring."

Hearing that, I nodded vigorously. "Don't worry, I'll shower and go to bed right away."

I went to my room and closed the door.

I was too excited to sleep because of what Royce had said.

A property, bought the year I had my child, near the fishing village.

These clues combined were the answer I had been longing for. I was almost certain that was where my child was.

I showered and lay in bed, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. My mind was filled with thoughts of seeing my child tomorrow.

By midnight, I still hadn't fallen asleep. I got up to get a glass of water.

I noticed the light was still on in Royce's room next door.

I knocked on his door. I heard the sound of a chair moving, and soon he came to open the door.

Seeing me, he sighed. "Caroline, I told you to sleep early. Why are you still up like a kid pretending to sleep?"

"What are you doing up?"

I felt like a student caught playing with their phone by a parent, feeling inexplicably guilty.

I shook my head. "I was thirsty. Why are you still up? Why are you lecturing me?"

Royce stepped aside. His room had a desk with a computer on it.

I was about to walk over out of curiosity, but his next words stopped me.

"I'm in a video conference."

"Then why did you come over? Won't they hear us talking?"

Royce shook his head. "Don't worry, I'm just listening. I muted myself."

"Why aren't you sleeping?"

I placed my empty glass on his desk. He poured me a glass of warm water.

"I'm too excited to sleep. I'm so happy thinking about finding my child."

"You probably can't understand how I feel."

To my surprise, Royce nodded seriously. "I'm trying my best to understand. Because of you, I care about your child too."

I immediately wanted to put down the glass and run away. I didn't know where Royce had learned to be so smooth-talking.

I quickly pushed him. "Go back to your meeting. I'll drink my water and go back to sleep."

Royce lifted the blanket on his bed. "Sleep here. I'll keep an eye on you."

"So you don't stay up again."

"Sleep here?"

I was stunned. Did Royce plan to sleep in the same bed after his meeting?

I wasn't ready for that.

I rubbed my hands, about to refuse.

But he said, "Don't worry, I'll sleep in your room later."

He turned off the light above the bed, leaving only a small lamp on his desk.

I always needed a nightlight to sleep. After what I'd been through, complete darkness made me uneasy.

So this dim light was perfect for me.

I got into bed. Maybe it was the soft sounds of Royce working on his computer that made me feel safe.

I quickly grew sleepy, my eyelids heavy, and drifted off.

I had a peaceful dream. I found my child, and he hugged me, calling me "Mom."

I rubbed his head. "Good boy, let's go home."

I held his hand and walked toward the light.

Then I woke up.

The room was empty. Thick curtains blocked the view outside, with only a sliver of light peeking through.

A small nightlight was still on by the bed. I didn't know how Royce knew I was afraid of the dark.

I felt refreshed, waking up naturally after a good dream. It was better than any medicine.

When I went downstairs, Royce was reading a book.

"You're awake?"

"You said you weren't tired, but you slept for ten hours. I almost went to wake you."

I stuck out my tongue, feeling a bit guilty. "Why didn't you wake me?"

###chapter 233

It was only then that I realized, "Oh no, are we too late? We gotta go, like, right now."

"You should've woken me up. How did I sleep so long?"

Royce sighed, got up, and put a reassuring hand on my shoulder.

"Hey, it's not your fault. You were just really tired."

"Don't worry, we'll head out right after you eat something."

"I've already got everything set up."

With his reassurance, I felt a wave of relief and nodded.

"That's good."

The table was set with various breakfast items, probably bought by Royce or prepared by the housekeeper. There was one plate of scrambled eggs that looked pretty unappetizing.

The eggs were a mess, with the edges burnt.

Seeing my gaze linger on the plate, he said, "I made those."

I nodded, having already guessed.

"I was gonna toss them, but the housekeeper said it would be wasteful, so I kept them."

"Why throw them out? I'll eat them."

I grabbed some utensils and ate the scrambled eggs he made.

Honestly, the meal tasted like cardboard to me because my mind was elsewhere, too preoccupied to savor the food.

So whether the eggs were burnt or bitter, I couldn't really tell.

I quickly finished eating, went upstairs to change clothes, and then said to him, "Let's go!"

Royce nodded and led me outside.

Next to the estate was a wild forest park, a luxurious area with plenty of fresh air, clearly a place that cost a fortune.

Inside, there was even a helipad with a small helicopter parked on it.

"I've arranged for us to take this. It'll be much faster."

"But it can only get us to the county where Karen bought her house. From there, it'll be a long drive to the fishing village, so we need to save time where we can."

I nodded, impressed by his meticulous planning.

I could never have arranged all this in such a short time.

We boarded the helicopter and put on our helmets.

Soon, the helicopter landed us on the rooftop of a tall building.

Royce said to me, "This is the county where Karen bought her house. The surrounding area is full of fishing villages, and this county is the closest town to all of them. The locals come here to shop."

I was eager to find out the secret behind the house Karen bought, feeling a bit excited.

We headed to the neighborhood where Karen's house was located. It was considered upscale in the county, with security guards at the entrance and a well-equipped property management office.

When we tried to enter, the guard asked for an access card.

Fortunately, Royce was prepared and handed one over. "We're here to do some repairs for the residents of Unit 501 in Building 2. They said something was broken."

The guard didn't seem suspicious and let us in.

No wonder Royce had specifically told me to dress casually this morning, suggesting I wear pants instead of a skirt.

He had thought of everything!

We arrived at the house, but it was eerily quiet, with no sounds coming from inside.

There wasn't even the faintest hint of a child's cry, making it seem like an uninhabited place.

I started to panic and looked at Royce, unsure of what to do.

He shook his head. "Don't worry, even if the kid's not here, there'll be other clues."

I nodded, watching him enter the code to unlock the door.

I didn't ask how Royce got the code, but I had a feeling he always had a way. It seemed like nothing was unsolvable for him.

The house smelled of dust, as if it hadn't been lived in for a long time.

As we walked in, our footsteps left clear prints on the floor.

It looked like the owner had moved out in a hurry, leaving many things behind.

Or maybe they only took the most useful items.

We found an old phone in the house, a model from several years ago, likely discarded.

I took it, thinking it might hold some secrets.

Before we could examine it, the neighbor suddenly opened their door and looked at us suspiciously.

"Who are you two? This isn't your house, is it?"

Royce smoothly explained, "We're here on behalf of the owner to do some repairs."

The neighbor didn't believe him. "Really? I haven't heard anything about that."

"That woman usually does everything herself. She's pretty stingy."

I caught an important detail: the house owner was a woman.

But being stingy didn't match Karen's behavior.

Since moving up in the world, Karen had become quite the spender, never skimping on anything.

So the stinginess didn't fit Karen's profile, suggesting the owner was someone else.

Royce remained calm. "You can call and check if you want. We're here because she doesn't have time to come herself."

"Alright, wait here. I'll make a call."

The neighbor went back inside to make the call, leaving the door open.

I was anxious and grabbed Royce's arm. "What do we do? If she calls, we'll be exposed!"

Royce shook his head. "Don't worry, I've got this. Worst case, if we're found out, you run first."

His fearless attitude made me even more nervous.

But I couldn't just leave, so I gritted my teeth and waited.

The neighbor returned after making the call. "I just called, and she did say she hired someone to fix the place. She's planning to sell it and wanted to check for any issues."

"Have you found anything broken yet?"

Royce shook his head. "Not yet. Some appliances have been without power for too long. We'll need to turn the power back on and check again in a day or two."

"Alright, hurry up then."

The neighbor went back inside and closed the door.

I let out a sigh of relief and looked at Royce, wanting to ask how he managed all this.

But Royce just gently closed the door and shook his head.

I realized this wasn't a good place to talk, as the neighbor could be eavesdropping.

Royce led me to the elevator, and I finally asked, "What happened? I thought we were going to be exposed."

"We found out about this house and then discovered online that it was looking for repair workers for electrical maintenance."

###chapter 234

"Just when we were wondering how to get in, everything just fell into place so smoothly."

I nodded. It was quite the coincidence.

As we headed downstairs, it hit me. "Wait a sec, didn't you say this house was under Earl's name? So why's there a woman living here now?"

"That woman might be the one taking care of your kid. If we find her, we might find the child."

"And that room, it looked like it was deliberately messed up to hide any trace of the child, but there wasn't a single thing left behind."

"At least this trip wasn't a total bust. Let's see if there's any clue on this phone."

I quickly pulled the phone out of my bag and pressed the power button.

No response. Not surprising, really. The phone had probably been out of use for a while. It'd be a miracle if it turned on.

We found a random hotel and plugged the phone in to charge.

While waiting, I started to wonder why the woman had left.

"That house is pretty upscale for this town. Why wouldn't she stay there?"

Royce shook his head. "Hard to say right now, but she must've felt some kind of danger to leave in such a hurry."

"And she didn't want anyone to know where the child was. That's odd. Besides us, who else would be looking for her?"

"She might be trying to protect the child or hide the child. But from what I see, hiding seems more likely."

I nodded. "Yeah, maybe she just wanted to keep the child safe."

"You're right. The phone's on. Let's check it out."

After charging for a bit, the phone finally powered up. As soon as the startup animation finished, a photo popped up on the screen.

It was a picture of a child, smiling widely.

The child hadn't grown any teeth yet, looking only a few months old, with bright eyes and a delicate nose.

I immediately recognized the child and nodded quickly. "This is my child. His eyes are just like Brett's when he was little. I can't be wrong."

"So the owner of this phone took my child."

"Very likely. Let's see if there are any other clues. If not, I'll get some tech people to crack the phone."

Unfortunately, Royce and I didn't find anything useful on the phone. There wasn't even a photo of the mysterious woman holding my child.

Feeling disheartened, I handed the phone to Royce.

He caught it and patted my head reassuringly.

"Don't worry. I'll take it to the tech department and have them analyze it. There's still hope."

"Trust me."

I nodded, but I couldn't help feeling down.

Back at the hotel, I called Savannah to ask if anything unusual had happened at home recently.

Savannah said, "No, no one has come by. It's just been us."

"I also told them not to talk about it, especially the kids. Brett is older now and understands what I mean."

Hearing this, I felt relieved and thanked her.

But I didn't tell Savannah about what was happening on my end, to avoid confusing her and causing unnecessary worry.

Soon, Royce's tech team managed to recover the photos from the phone.

But the only noteworthy thing on the phone was the child's photos. There were no pictures of the woman taking care of him.

She had deleted them in a hurry, thinking they wouldn't be found. But with today's technology, even deleted photos can be recovered.

Looking at the photos of my child growing up, I couldn't help but tear up.

This was my child. He had grown up without ever seeing his mother.

This child was truly pitiful.

Royce sat beside me, patting my shoulder to comfort me.

"What's wrong? Calm down. Tomorrow we'll go back and do another sweep."

I nodded. It was better than doing nothing.

The next day, Royce and I went back. The neighbors were familiar with us now, so they didn't say anything.

Just then, a woman appeared at the door, looking at us warily.

"Who are you? Who let you in?"

Royce repeated the story from yesterday. The woman still looked skeptical. "Really?"

At that moment, a neighbor opened their door. "It's true, Eloise. I called yesterday. They really are repairmen."

Hearing this, the woman called Eloise relaxed.

She peeked inside. "Such a nice house, and she just up and left. That woman must be crazy."

Royce and I exchanged a glance, thinking Eloise might know something.

We cleared our throats and pretended to check the wiring while trying to get more information.

"Yeah, we were curious too. Why would she leave such a nice house?"

Eloise nodded in agreement. "Exactly. A few months ago, she left in a hurry, taking the child with her, and never came back."

"Really? I didn't see any child's stuff in the house."

"I don't know. I suspect she stole the child. She always covered the child's face when going out and rarely left the house. Very suspicious."

"Do you know her name? I'm worried she might not pay us for our work."

"I don't know her name. She was always aloof and didn't talk to us neighbors. But I did take a photo of her once."

My eyes lit up, and I exchanged a look with Royce. "Can we see the photo? We need to check if she's the one who hired us."

Eloise, without any hesitation, showed us her phone. The photo was of a woman in her late 30s, still quite attractive despite some fine lines around her eyes.

"That's not the person who hired us," I quickly said.

I tugged at Royce. "Honey, look. The person who hired us was an older woman, right?"

Royce frowned, taking the phone. "Yes, the person who hired us was older, not this woman. Eloise, can we take a picture of this photo?"

###chapter 235

Eloise waved us in, making us feel welcome.

"So, who hired you guys?"

I pulled up a photo of Karen on my phone and handed it to Eloise.

"This is the person who hired us. It's from her Facebook."

Eloise's eyes lit up. "Isn't that the landlord? She used to come around a lot earlier this year, maybe once a month. Every time she came, she'd yell at this woman, really nasty stuff."

"And the woman never fought back, just took it quietly."

"We tried to comfort her, but the old lady told us to mind our own business."

"Looks like the landlord hired us. Thanks, Eloise."

"No problem. Just finish up quick and get out of here."

"By the way, be careful working for that old lady. She's got a really sharp tongue."

I nodded, remembering Karen's sharp tongue all too well.

Eloise started to leave but turned back. "Oh, and I saw some men knocking on her door once. They looked pretty rough. I asked them a couple of questions in the elevator, and they just glared at me."

"Men?"

"Yeah, like debt collectors. Maybe that woman owes money."

Royce and I exchanged glances, realizing it was probably another group trying to take the child. Maybe that's why the woman moved out early with the kid.

"Alright, we're done here. Thanks, Eloise."

"No problem. Hurry up and leave; it's already noon."

Royce and I left the complex, and he immediately sent the photo to Simon. "Check out who this woman is and where she lives. She might be the one who took the kid."

Simon replied quickly, saying he was on it.

At least we got the woman's photo today. It wasn't a wasted trip.

Now we just had to wait and see if Simon could find out where she lived. With the photo, everything would be easier.

Finding someone isn't easy, like looking for a needle in a haystack.

So when we didn't hear back by evening, I sat alone on the couch, looking at photos and videos in a folder.

They were memories of my child, and I didn't want to miss a single moment.

His first steps, his first words, his first smile, his heart-wrenching cries in front of the camera-every frame I wanted to etch into my memory.

Royce seemed to understand and didn't disturb me.

I sat there, looking at the photos, laughing and crying. Anyone who saw me would think I was crazy.

Around dinner time, Royce knocked and came in. "Dinner's ready. What are you doing?"

I quickly wiped my tears. "Nothing. Come in, let's eat together."

Royce nodded and walked in. His dress shoes made a satisfying sound on the hotel's wooden floor.

It was only after dinner that I noticed Royce was wearing a suit, looking very formal, as if he was going to an event.

"Where are you going?"

"No, I just had a dinner meeting. I rushed back because I didn't want you to go hungry."

"By the way, I have some news about Irene. Not sure if you want to hear it."

"Her? What about her?"

"Irene's been caught for accounting fraud. She's likely going to be sentenced."

"She deserves it. I'll make sure the entire Jordan family ends up in jail."

Royce nodded. "Take it slow. One step at a time."

"Right now, our priority is to find the child and get back to Suncrest City."

"The bidding process is about to start. If you don't show up, Alfonso might get suspicious."

I nodded. I was well aware of this, which made me even more anxious.

But there was nothing I could do except be anxious.

Just then, as if on cue, Alfonso called me.

His voice sounded normal, as if he didn't know I had left Suncrest City.

"Ms. Sharp? Have you made a decision? I'd like to take you out for dinner."

I frowned. "Dinner isn't necessary. I know you're eager for an answer, but shouldn't I take some time to consider such a big decision?"

"And if you have photos of the child, send them to me. Otherwise, how can I trust you're telling the truth? What if you use fake information to steal the project from me?"

"A little caution is good, Ms. Sharp. Since you want to see, I'll send you the child's photo."

My phone buzzed, and a photo came through.

I opened it. It was a picture taken from his perspective, showing only the child, whose face matched the one in my phone exactly.

It seemed Alfonso really knew the child's whereabouts. I had to act quickly, or there might be complications when the bidding started.

Soon, we got some information about the woman. Her name was Adelaide, 45 years old.

She came from a fishing village and hadn't had much schooling. She married a man after starting work at a factory but ended up frequently at the police station due to domestic violence. Eventually, she divorced him.

She had been working at the factory ever since. Though she had a few relationships, none lasted long.

"Adelaide?"

"Can you find out where she lives now?"

"The only lead we have is that Adelaide's ancestral home is in Meadowbrook Village."

I was stunned. I had a gut feeling that Meadowbrook Village might be the final step.

I quickly grabbed Royce. "I have to go there. I feel like something's up."

Royce nodded. "Don't worry, I'll go with you."

We took a cab to Meadowbrook Village that night.

The night air in Meadowbrook Village had a salty tang, with a few scattered lights in the distance and the sound of waves in the background.

The dark sea was especially terrifying, reminding me of Jason.

I shook my head, trying to dispel the bad feeling.

Maybe I was just scaring myself. Maybe the child was being well cared for by Adelaide.

We slept in the car overnight, and by morning, the villagers were starting their day.

Royce and I took the opportunity to drive into the village.

He had switched to a regular car beforehand, so we didn't attract much attention.

We stopped at the village entrance, where a few elderly folks were chatting.

We knew this was our chance to gather information.

We got out of the car and asked, "Excuse me, do you know where Adelaide lives?"

The elderly folks all turned to look at us. "What do you want with Adelaide?"

###chapter 236

Royce quickly waved his hands. "Hey, don't get the wrong idea. We're cops. We're here to investigate Adelaide."

The elderly folks immediately got excited, talking over each other.

"I knew it! Adelaide must've gotten into some trouble out there. Why else would she come back?"

"With her looks, she could easily find a man out there. Why would she come back to live a hard life alone?"

"She must've done something wrong. Who knows what kind of trouble she's in."

Their conversation got more and more outrageous. Royce and I exchanged glances, unable to get a word in.

"Ma'am, could you tell us where Adelaide lives? We need to find her."

One of the elderly women nodded and stood up, dusting off her clothes. "Sure, I'll take you there."

We followed her through a series of twists and turns down a narrow path. The area was deserted, surrounded by vast salt flats with only a few houses standing.

She pointed to a small house. "That's the place. Adelaide is pretty lazy, so she's probably still in bed. You'll find her inside."

Royce and I exchanged another glance and quietly entered the yard.

The house was eerily quiet, with the curtains tightly drawn, as if to hide something inside.

Royce positioned himself by the door, while I knocked.

"Hello, we're here to distribute relief funds. Could you open the door, please?"

"Relief funds?" A voice quickly responded from inside. Soon, a woman appeared at the door. "You must be mistaken. I don't need any relief funds. I have money."

"That can't be right. The village head told us there's only you and a child here, which fits our criteria for relief funds."

"We just need to check your situation. Could you open the door so I can bring it in?"

Adelaide hesitated for a moment but eventually opened the door.

As soon as she did, I peeked inside and saw that the door to the room she had been sleeping in was tightly shut, as if hiding something.

Something felt off, really off.

At that moment, Royce kicked the door open.

"Adelaide, don't move! Where's the child?"

Adelaide's face turned pale, and she bolted towards the closed room.

We had no idea what she was planning, but we couldn't let her go. I grabbed her arm, but she was surprisingly strong and shook me off.

Luckily, Royce managed to restrain her.

"Don't move, or we'll call the police!"

"You know what you've done. Is the child in there yours?"

"Did Karen tell you to hide the child?"

Realizing she couldn't break free, Adelaide stopped struggling. "Yeah, how did you find me?"

"I thought I hid well enough. Who sent you? Renee? Or..."

I cut her off. "I'm the child's mother."

With that, I pushed open the door to the room.

Inside, there was a small bed with a swaddled baby on it.

My child was actually a few months younger than Aria, so while Aria could speak a few words, he could only express himself through crying.

Seeing his tiny hands waving, I was overwhelmed with emotion.

I couldn't believe I had found him. He saw me and smiled, waving his hands.

I scooped him up, and he seemed to sense something, starting to cry loudly in my arms.

I cried too, holding him tightly.

The feeling of finding him was more precious than anything in the world.

"Thank goodness I found you. You won't have to suffer here anymore."

Adelaide, still restrained, protested. "What do you mean suffer? I didn't mistreat him."

I glared at her. "Taking a newborn away from his mother is monstrous."

Adelaide fell silent.

I carried the baby out, but she suddenly broke free from Royce and lunged at me, trying to take the baby.

"Don't move! Give him back to me!"

"We've been together since he was born. He can't be without me."

"Please, let him stay with me."

"You're talking nonsense. How could I leave him with a kidnapper like you?"

"I'm not just taking him away; I'm calling the police on you."

I glared at Adelaide, my voice full of anger.

Her face turned pale, and she suddenly bolted, running away before we could stop her.

Royce hesitated, then chased after her.

But she knew the area too well and quickly disappeared. Royce came back, shaking his head. "Couldn't catch her. We'll have to call the police."

I nodded. "Yes, we have to."

"But it's okay. The most important thing is that the baby is back. Everything else is secondary."

I held the baby tightly as we got into the car.

I was paranoid, feeling like everyone around us wanted to take my baby.

"Royce, please hurry. I'm scared."

He nodded. "Don't worry, everything will be fine."

He drove away from the village, gradually speeding up.

Once the village was out of sight, I finally relaxed, looking down at the baby in my arms.

He looked just like the baby in Adelaide's phone, and his eyes were a perfect match for Brett's. I was almost certain he was mine.

I held him tightly. He looked around curiously, unaware of what had happened.

"I'm so sorry for what you've been through. From now on, you'll have a good life with me, okay?"

He seemed to understand and smiled.

He was so adorable, I couldn't help but pinch his little cheek.

"You're so cute."

Royce drove us back to the hotel. I carried the baby inside.

He said, "A baby this young might not handle a helicopter ride well. How about we take the train back?"

I was touched by his thoughtfulness. "Thank you."

"It's nothing. I got us tickets for tonight. We'll be in Skyview City by midnight."

"Call your mom and let her know the baby is safe."

I nodded, grateful for his support.

###chapter 237

When Royce mentioned it, I suddenly remembered that my family was probably anxiously waiting for news. They were likely feeling just as distressed as I was.

I quickly called home to let them know that I had found the child.

Kelly was so emotional that I could hear the tears in her voice over the phone. "As long as you found him, that's all that matters. Please, bring him back quickly."

"Alright, we'll head back to Skyview City tomorrow, and the day after, we'll be back in Suncrest City."

Just in time for the bidding event in Suncrest City. No matter what tricks Alfonso had up his sleeve, he wouldn't be able to take the child from me or threaten me anymore.

I held the child close as Royce and I returned to Skyview City. Without a plane and given the child's special status, we had to use some unconventional methods to get back.

We stayed in Skyview City for a day. I couldn't bear to let go of the child, holding him in my arms the entire time.

He still seemed a bit unfamiliar with me, staring at me with wide, curious eyes.

At night, he wasn't used to my scent and cried frequently.

I had to get up to comfort him, trying to ease his anxiety.

After all, to him, it must have felt like a stranger had taken him away, and he must have been very scared.

The child didn't know yet that I was his biological mother.

After he finally fell asleep, I managed to get some rest.

The next evening, Royce arranged for us to return to Suncrest City.

Just then, I found out that the house Brandon and I used to live in couldn't be sold because someone was living there.

I was stunned to learn that Brandon had broken into the house and was driving away anyone who came to see it.

I sneered. There was no way I would let Brandon act so brazenly. That house wasn't his property; what right did he have to do this?

Royce and I rushed to the house. I kicked the door open, and the stench of alcohol hit me.

The floor was littered with empty bottles, and Brandon was passed out drunk on the floor.

I kicked him awake. "What are you doing? Is this your house?"

"Get out of here right now. I'm not joking!"

Brandon groggily got up, rubbing his sleepy eyes.

"Wife? Why are you back?"

I couldn't believe his shamelessness. I glared at him. "Look closely. Who's your wife?"

"Brandon, we're divorced. This is my house. Get out now, or I'll call the police!"

Brandon's lips curled into a smirk. "Why? Doesn't this house belong to me too?"

"You still want the house? Dream on!"

"I bought this house when we first got married, when you were broke. Now that you're back to square one, you want to take my house? Not a chance."

"You're a loser, a lifelong loser."

"Get out of my house now, or I'll call the police."

Brandon sobered up a bit, his face darkening as he realized what I was saying.

"I'm a loser? Don't forget, you let this loser fool you for ten years."

"And you willingly let me fool you. If I'm a loser, what does that make you?"

I couldn't believe he had the nerve to bring this up. I sneered. "You're truly shameless."

"Get out now. Did you hear me?"

I pointed at Brandon's nose.

Brandon scowled. "Caroline, I've had enough of your holier-than-thou attitude. You've never respected me in this marriage, not once in these ten years."

"What are you pretending for? You were my wife for ten years."

"If I had known, I would have listened to Shirley and used more poison to kill you."

I sneered. "Too bad you didn't succeed. I survived and got my revenge."

"I'm living better than anyone in the Jordan family. Do you think you're the pride of the Jordan family?"

"Everyone has abandoned you. Irene secretly transferred your money, Earl has been with Renee for a long time, and now that Renee has used you up, she discarded you."

"How pathetic you are, living in your family's lies. You're just a pitiful wretch."

I had completely broken Brandon. He gritted his teeth and lunged at me. "Shut up!"

But before he could reach me, Royce kicked him away, sending him crashing into his own empty bottles, blood spilling everywhere.

I stood over him, looking down as he clutched his chest, gasping.

"Hit me, will you? I'm calling the police."

"Go ahead, call them. I'll report you for trespassing."

"We only acted in self-defense because you broke in and attacked us. There's surveillance footage, Brandon. You can't escape."

He glared at us, knowing he couldn't argue.

"Tell me, whose child is Aria? Why did you go to such lengths to place her with me?"

Brandon turned away. "I don't know."

I sneered. "Not talking? Fine, I'll call the police."

"Wait, I really don't know."

Brandon suddenly grabbed my clothes. "I swear, I don't know. It was my mom's decision. She told me to switch the child. I disagreed, but you know how it is with my mom. I had to respect her, so I eventually agreed."

"After the switch, I kept looking for the child, but I couldn't find her. I don't know where they hid her."

"Believe it or not, that's the truth."

Looking at Brandon's face, maybe he was telling the truth. If Karen decided to switch the child, it must be related to her.

But whose child was it? And why place her with me?

Karen was dead, and finding the truth wouldn't be easy.

But I was determined to raise the child unless he chose to leave me when he grew up.

"Even so, do you think you can escape? We've already called the police. They're on their way."

"Why are you so cruel? I told you I don't know. Why arrest me?"

"Do you want the kids to be without a father?"

"To them, it doesn't matter if they have a father or not."

"Besides, you don't deserve to be their father."

As I finished speaking, the police burst in.

###chapter 238

I pointed at Brandon and said, "Officer, this is the guy who broke into my house. Arrest him."

The evidence against Brandon was solid, and the police quickly took him into custody.

As he was being led away, he glared at me and spat, "Caroline, you're ruthless. Just you wait."

I smirked, unfazed by his threats.

After Brandon was taken away, I hired someone to clean up the house and listed it for sale online. Unfortunately, the house's reputation had taken a hit, so I had to lower the price, but at least it sold.

With the money from the sale, I finally felt at ease. Brandon wouldn't have a place to cause trouble anymore.

On the way back with Royce, I suddenly thought of Briar.

Since I was in Skyview City, I figured I should visit her. After all, she was so reluctant to leave Suncrest City last time.

So, we took a detour to her school and waited at the gate. I remembered Leo mentioning that Briar always walked to and from school alone, such a well-behaved kid.

Today, I planned to give her a ride and treat her to a meal.

As soon as I arrived at the school gate, I spotted Briar inside, looking downcast.

"Briar!"

I called out to her. She looked up instinctively, and her eyes lit up when she saw me.

"Ms. Sharp, what are you doing here?"

She ran over and hugged my waist. I patted her head. "I had some business in Skyview City and thought I'd drop by to see you."

I pointed to Royce beside me. "This is Mr. Castillo."

Royce waved, and Briar shyly nodded. "Hello, Mr. Castillo."

I put my arm around her shoulders and asked, "Have you eaten yet? How about I take you out for something delicious?"

Briar perked up immediately and shook her head. "Not yet."

"Great, let's go out to eat. What do you feel like having?"

"Fried chicken? Burgers?"

Her eyes sparkled, and she nodded eagerly.

I knew kids loved that stuff. Brett used to love it too, always asking for it as a reward for good grades.

"Why don't you call your dad and let him know, so I can take you out for dinner?"

To my surprise, Briar shook her head. "No, I don't want my dad to know. If he finds out, he'll ask a million questions."

"Besides, I usually eat dinner at a nearby shop by myself, so it's no big deal, Ms. Sharp. Even if I'm late, he won't worry."

"Really? What if your dad gets worried?"

"He never worries. He never cares about me in the evenings."

Briar pouted.

I frowned, feeling like the Leo Briar described wasn't the Leo I knew, but I couldn't pinpoint the difference.

I took her to a fast-food place and told her to order whatever she wanted.

Briar excitedly ordered a bunch of food, and seeing her so happy made me happy too.

"Order whatever you like. It's on me today."

Royce and I didn't want to eat fast food, so we planned to eat after Briar finished.

Royce knew everything that had happened with Briar at my place, so we chatted without any awkwardness.

"How's school in Skyview City? Are you enjoying it?" I asked while watching Briar eat.

She immediately shook her head. "Not at all. It's not as fun as Suncrest City. Ms. Sharp, can't I go back?"

"What's wrong? Tell me about it."

"They're all liars. I don't like them."

Royce and I exchanged glances. I dropped my smile and asked, "Who are the liars?"

Briar said, "Dad's a liar, Mom's a liar, and Mr. Earl Jordan is a liar too."

"What did they lie about?"

"They didn't just lie to me; they lied to you too."

"Dad doesn't have a job. He stays home every day but tells you he has a job."

I was stunned, not understanding why Leo would lie about that.

"Why would he lie to me?"

"He doesn't need to lie to you. He says we're struggling, but he's actually rich."

"I saw him bring home a lot of money once. When I asked where it came from, he wouldn't tell me. We have enough money to live on, but he pretends we're poor and makes me save every penny. I don't know why."

"And Mom, she's a liar too."

"What about your mom?"

"She doesn't care about me or our family. She has another family outside."

I raised an eyebrow but stayed silent. "I heard she has another man. Once, Dad found out about her other family, and they had a huge fight. Since then, Mom rarely comes home."

"Even when she does, they only talk for a couple of minutes in the study before she leaves. She never looks at me."

I sighed, feeling sorry for Briar. Kids suffer the most in such families.

"And what about Mr. Jordan?"

"He made me take pictures of your house and everywhere else."

"He said he wanted to see what your house looked like. I thought it was strange and didn't want to do it, but he yelled at me."

Briar's voice was filled with frustration.

"Earl made you do that?"

"Yes, and when I ran away from home, it wasn't because I fought with Dad. Mr. Jordan told me to hide so you wouldn't find me."

"Why?"

"He made me hide a small device in the house and where I was hiding."

My eyebrows furrowed. A small device?

Could it be a bug?

"What does it look like? Show me."

Briar nodded and took out her phone, showing me a picture of the device. "It looks like this. I don't know what it is, and when I asked, he yelled at me."

I showed the picture to Royce, and we both immediately recognized it as a bug.

"Do you remember where you hid them?"

Briar nodded. "Yes, I put one behind the living room sofa, one in the surveillance room, and one in the attic where I was hiding."

"So Earl made you run away just to hide those devices?"

"How did you get them from him?"

"That day, I ran away and went to the back alley. He gave me the devices and told me to hide them. I didn't want to, but he threatened to hit me. I had no choice but to hide them."

###chapter 239

Briar is still just a kid. She got used by someone, and I don't plan on blaming her for it.

What I really need to figure out is why Earl hid so many listening devices in my house.

Ever since I sent Eugene to prison, we've been discussing important stuff in the living room. Who knows how much he overheard.

But it doesn't matter now. I've already got a plan to handle all the trouble.

There's no point in regretting past actions. We can only look for solutions.

After Briar finished eating, we got ready to take her home.

Briar shook her head. "No, if you take me home, my dad will lecture me again. I'll go back by myself."

"Ms. Sharp, can't I go to school in Suncrest City?"

I sighed and patted her head, feeling just as upset.

"I'd love for you to come to Suncrest City, but you need your dad's permission, remember?"

"Otherwise, if you just come over, I'd be tricking a kid."

Briar sighed heavily. "Alright, can I visit during the holidays?"

"Of course, you're always welcome."

After sending Briar off, Royce and I headed back to his place.

On the way, I couldn't help but sigh. "Such a good kid, born into such a family. Both kids are already ruined by them, Jason and Briar."

Royce squeezed my hand. "Don't worry. That kid isn't dumb. At least she knows right from wrong, or she wouldn't have come to you."

"She won't go astray, trust me."

I nodded.

When we got home, the house was filled with the sound of a crying baby.

A servant came out holding the baby. "Ms. Sharp, your baby has been crying non-stop. I don't know what's wrong."

I quickly took the baby and patted his back, trying to soothe him like other babies.

But he kept struggling and crying.

Royce said, "Let me try."

I was curious. Royce, who was always busy with work and had no kids, how could he soothe a baby?

To my surprise, as soon as Royce took the baby and patted him a bit, he miraculously stopped crying and even seemed ready to sleep.

I was pleasantly surprised, thinking, when did Royce learn to soothe babies?

But the baby didn't cry again in his arms. After he put the baby to sleep in the crib, he looked at me proudly.

"See, I told you this baby is naturally close to me."

I rolled my eyes. "It's just a coincidence."

He didn't say anything, just smiled smugly.

Since our flight was at night, I went to the pet store in the afternoon.

I've been so busy lately that I left my kitten at the pet store and hadn't checked on it.

Moving it around frequently was inconvenient, and I was afraid Brandon might harm it if I left it at home. So, the pet store was the best option.

After returning to Suncrest City, I probably wouldn't come back for a long time. Life would be more stable.

So, it was necessary to bring the kitten with me.

At the pet store window, the kitten lay there looking sickly and unhappy.

I gently tapped the glass. It looked up, meowed, and even its tail perked up, forming a little hook.

I knew this meant it was happy. "I'm here to take you home. Are you happy?"

The kitten pawed at the glass, meowing anxiously, as if telling me it was happy.

I asked the staff to bring it out and put it in the carrier.

I planned to take it with me back to Suncrest City.

That night, we all boarded the plane together.

I don't know how he managed to get the baby's identity, but no one stopped me from bringing the baby on board.

It wasn't until we landed in Suncrest City that I breathed a sigh of relief and straightened the baby's clothes.

"We're home. You won't be far from me anymore."

Since we secretly went to Skyview City, we didn't ask Kelly to pick us up. Making a big fuss would attract Alfonso's attention.

Even Earl had planted listening devices around us, so we had to be cautious.

Royce and I quietly returned home. As soon as we entered, everyone was waiting for us.

I carried the baby inside, and their eyes all focused on the baby, looking excited.

Even Brett was curious and joined in.

"Is this the one?"

Kathy looked at the baby in my arms. I nodded.

"Mom, take a look."

I handed the baby to Kelly. She took him and, looking at him, nodded excitedly. "He looks just like you when you were little."

I smiled proudly. "Good, that means we found the right one."

Kelly nodded. "Great, our family is finally reunited, not missing anyone."

Her words brought tears to my eyes. Only I knew how hard it was to achieve this.

I nodded. "Yes, we're reunited."

I placed the baby on the couch, and everyone gathered around curiously.

Brett stared at the small figure on the couch and tugged at my hand. "Mom, who is this?"

I patted his head and smiled. "This is your brother. You were supposed to have three siblings, but he was taken away. Mr. Castillo and I brought him back."

"Are you happy he's back?"

Brett was stunned at first, then nodded heavily.

"Yes, I love having siblings. When he grows up, I can take him to play around here."

I patted his head. "You, you just want to play."

"Have you finished your homework?"

Brett stuck out his tongue and said guiltily, "No."

Kathy and Kelly sat by the baby, chattering about his looks.

I pulled Savannah aside. Since finding out Briar planted listening devices in our house, I had secretly asked Savannah to remove them all.

I asked her, "Did you remove all the listening devices?"

Savannah nodded. "Yes, they're all here."

She handed me a bag of listening devices.

I looked at the bag, shocked by the number. Earl had gone to great lengths to investigate us, using Briar to plant so many.

"Find a way to destroy these without them finding out."

###chapter 240

Savannah nodded. "Alright, Caroline, I get it. You should take a break. You must be wiped out."

I shook my head. Honestly, I wasn't that tired. Royce had been carrying the baby the whole way, and I slept most of the time on the plane.

I glanced at Royce. He was looking at the baby with such tenderness, not a trace of fatigue on his face.

I knew that if anyone deserved my gratitude for finding the baby, it was Royce.

I tugged at his sleeve. "What are you doing? You should go rest. You barely slept on the way here."

To my surprise, Royce shook his head. "I'm good, not tired."

"Are you sure you're not tired?"

"I'm not tired either, but you haven't slept much."

"A little longer won't hurt. I need to check on the bidding situation at the company. By the way, Asher told me they're here too."

"You should probably stay out of sight. I think Asher has a good shot at winning."

I understood what Royce meant. If my relationship with Asher was exposed, even if he won the project, someone might report it.

We wanted to keep our conscience clear, so I had to avoid any suspicion.

"Alright, I won't see him. We'll talk after the bidding is over."

He nodded, said goodbye to Kelly, and left.

Kelly watched Royce's retreating figure and hinted, "Royce is a good guy. I'm very pleased."

I found it odd. "Mom, what are you talking about? What do you mean you're pleased?"

"Royce is indeed a good person."

"If you ever remarry and find someone like him, I'd be at ease."

I gave her a helpless look. "What are you thinking? Remarry? That's impossible."

"I have four kids now."

"Who would marry me with such a big family?"

It's almost laughable. Ten years of marriage left me with nothing but these four kids.

If anyone knew, they'd avoid me like the plague.

Who would marry me?

I didn't doubt Royce's sincerity, but I felt he might not have thought it through yet.

Kelly shook her head silently. "I don't think so."

I ignored her and focused on playing with the baby.

After the long journey, the baby was exhausted and soon fell asleep.

Maybe he felt safe knowing he was home.

Just then, I got a call from Alfonso.

I had been so happy these past few days that I forgot about him.

I answered the call, a bit impatient. "Alfonso? What do you want?"

Alfonso was taken aback by my tone but continued, "The bidding starts tomorrow. Have you thought it over, Ms. Sharp?"

I guessed he didn't know I had the baby back. I sneered.

"Of course, I have."

"What?"

Alfonso's voice was filled with excitement, thinking the project was his.

"My answer is no way. Keep dreaming!"

Alfonso was stunned, unable to believe what he heard. "Ms. Sharp? Are you sure?"

"Your own child isn't worth more than this project? You must be a terrible mother, so cold-hearted."

I scoffed. "Think what you want. I won't give the project to someone who threatens me."

"You..."

Alfonso's voice turned sinister. "In that case, don't blame me for being ruthless, Ms. Sharp."

"If something happens to your child, don't blame me."

"Go ahead and try."

"Use whatever means you have. Your threats don't scare me, Alfonso."

With that, I hung up, not wanting to waste any more time on him.

He was too arrogant, thinking he could find the baby when others couldn't.

He's probably losing it right now.

But what does that have to do with me? I should have known anyone who could associate with someone like Brandon wouldn't be a good person.

The most important thing is he hurt Celestia. If I gave him the project, I'd be betraying my friend and not avenging Isadora.

Thinking of this, I called Isadora.

I told her about Alfonso coming to Suncrest City.

Isadora was in her late pregnancy, and her husband wouldn't let her go out. She was still agitated when she heard.

"That bastard, he's shameless, using his old tricks again."

"He's always been good at threats. Don't let him fool you."

"Don't worry, we're prepared. I have the baby back, so nothing will happen."

"That's good. Speaking of babies, I'm due at the end of this month."

"The doctor said my due date is soon. Can you come?"

I was taken aback. "I'll try. I have to be there for your delivery."

"It's okay if you can't. I'll send you an invitation for the full moon celebration. You can come then."

"Even if you can't come, you have to send a gift."

Isadora joked, and I laughed, holding the phone. "Of course. I'll be there for the full moon celebration, and I'll bring a gift."

"That's more like it. I'll be waiting for your gift."

"Alright, you must be tired. Get some rest."

"Don't think about Alfonso. He'll get what's coming to him. This will be resolved."

"Okay, I know."

After hanging up, I took a deep breath, feeling like everything around me was finally settled. I relaxed completely.

The result of over-relaxation was that I quickly fell asleep. When I woke up in the evening, I couldn't believe the past few days were real, so I rushed to the kids' room.

I opened the door and saw my kids sleeping soundly in their cribs, all three of them in dreamland.

I pinched their little cheeks one by one, feeling relieved.

Thank goodness it wasn't a dream. If I woke up to find it was all a dream, I wouldn't be able to handle it.

I grabbed a blanket and slept on the carpet in the kids' room. Only then did I feel at ease.

The next morning, I got a call from Asher.

He laughed and said, "Caroline, I just landed in Suncrest City. Do you have time for lunch?"

"Royce picked me up this morning. Why didn't you come?"

"She wants to avoid suspicion."

A calm voice came through the receiver, from Royce.

I nodded. "Yes, Asher, I reviewed the bidding companies' information. I think you have a good chance of winning."

###chapter 241

"But no matter what, as a shareholder in both companies, my identity is too obvious. So, I have to stay out of sight."

"Otherwise, if some people take advantage of it, that would be a disaster."

"True, I didn't think of that. I heard Alfonso is here too?"

"Yeah, he even tried to threaten me, but of course, I didn't let him get away with it."

"Good job. Alfonso's a real snake. You gotta watch your back with him."

Asher's blunt description made me laugh.

"Asher, you should get some rest. The bidding meeting starts at one. Even though I won't be there, Royce will be. Don't worry."

"Don't worry, I'm a grown-up businessman now. Nothing's gonna go wrong."

"Good. I'll be in the office this afternoon. We can meet after it's over."

After hanging up the phone, I went to freshen up, then changed into a professional outfit and applied light makeup, ready to go.

When I arrived at the company, I immediately saw Alfonso.

He walked up to me with a smile, greeting me as if nothing had happened yesterday.

"Ms. Sharp, you look even more stunning since the divorce."

Seeing his face, I felt a deep sense of dread. People like him, who harbor grudges but pretend nothing is wrong, are truly terrifying.

Who knows how he might try to get back at me behind my back.

I snorted coldly, "Really? Thanks for the compliment, Mr. Carr. I suggest you focus on preparing your bid. I heard there are many strong competitors today."

"Having real strength is more important than trying to take shortcuts, isn't it?"

Alfonso's smile froze, and an unreadable emotion flashed in his eyes.

But he quickly nodded, "Ms. Sharp, you're right. I'll keep that in mind."

I ignored him and turned to enter another office.

I was still worried about Asher. This was his first independent project since taking over the company. If he succeeded, he would establish himself in the industry with a high starting point.

It would almost guarantee a smooth path for him in the future.

As I sat in the office, feeling conflicted, Royce suddenly pushed the door open.

Today, he was wearing a pure black suit, which made him look incredibly restrained and composed.

His entire body was impeccably wrapped in the suit, sparking endless imagination.

Royce, standing nearly six feet tall with a lean and fit physique, was born to wear suits.

He always looked great in a suit.

I found myself staring at him for a long time until he waved his hand in front of me and chuckled, "What are you doing? Why are you staring at me like that?"

I coughed awkwardly, "Nothing, just lost in thought." Of course, I couldn't admit that I was mesmerized by him.

Royce laughed and didn't press the issue, "Asher has arrived. Do you want to see him?"

"No, let's wait until everything is over. I don't want to make it seem like I'm interfering."

He looked at me for a while and suddenly asked, "You seem really nervous."

"Are you worried about Asher?"

I thought Royce was really perceptive to notice my emotions.

I nodded, "How can I not be worried? This is Asher's first independent project since taking over the company."

"If he succeeds, his future will be secure."

"I naturally hope Asher has a smooth path ahead."

Royce patted my head, "Don't worry. You've probably assessed it yourself. Asher's company is the strongest contender. The project is likely to end up in his hands."

"Even if it doesn't, don't stress. He's got a long road ahead. Asher's young and has plenty of time."

I glanced at Royce, "You talk like you're much older, giving advice like an elder. You're the same age as Asher."

He shook his head without saying anything.

I sighed deeply, "Aren't you going? Don't they need you over there?"

"It hasn't started yet."

We nodded at each other. Just then, he suddenly put his arm around my shoulders and pulled me into his embrace.

"Alright, stop worrying."

He didn't realize that his action made my heart race even faster. I wanted to break free, but any attempt felt like I was being coy. He held me firmly.

"Royce? What are you doing?"

"I'm a bit nervous too. Let's support each other."

He said it so seriously, but I saw a playful smile in his eyes. I knew he was lying.

"Stop it. You don't look nervous at all."

"Who says? I'm actually very nervous. Feel it if you don't believe me."

He grabbed my hand and pressed it against his chest. I could hear his heart pounding, almost in sync with mine.

I widened my eyes, surprised that Royce was genuinely nervous.

"You..."

"Just kidding. Actually, every time I get close to you, my heart beats like this."

"Sorry, it seems to be beating too fast."

Royce's voice was still so gentle. He pursed his lips, and a faint scar on his lower lip hadn't faded yet.

I always avoided looking at that scar because it reminded me of what happened in the hospital that day.

I regretted that day, feeling I shouldn't have taken that step.

No matter what, Royce and I were from two different worlds, two extremes.

I had just escaped the mire of marriage, with four kids in tow, while Royce was a wealthy and handsome CEO, the dream husband for many girls. I shouldn't have been so impulsive.

Royce looked at my face and suddenly frowned, "Are you thinking about something negative again?"

"Like how you don't deserve me or something."

"Who taught you to despise yourself like this?"

I widened my eyes in disbelief, "How did you know?"

He chuckled, "Of course I know. I know everything about you."

"Let me tell you, no one is more suited for me than you. Stop thinking those negative thoughts. Underestimating yourself is a bad habit, Caroline."

"Even if someone better than me comes along, I believe he would fall for you without hesitation because you're so wonderful and outstanding."

"So now, I'm filled with a sense of crisis. I'm worried someone might steal you away."

"Open your eyes and look at the world. You'll see that there are many men better than me."

I laughed and shook my head, "Are you kidding?"

With Royce's qualities, how many could compare?

"You think that way because you like me too much."

As soon as I said that, I realized it was inappropriate and quickly covered my mouth.

###chapter 242

I noticed a subtle smile in Royce's eyes as he looked down at me. "What did you just say?"

I felt a wave of embarrassment. How could I, in my thirties, say something like that?

"I didn't say anything, and you didn't hear anything."

But he leaned in closer. "Oh, but I did hear you. You said you like me, right?"

I covered my face and shook my head, refusing to speak.

He chuckled softly. "Well, I think you're right. I do like you a lot."

I was stunned, my hand dropping from my face as I looked at Royce.

He leaned in and kissed me fully on the lips.

His warm breath brushed against my face, and I didn't know how to react. I could only stare at his fluttering eyelashes.

Our moist lips pressed together, and the sensation left me at a loss.

I could smell his pleasant cologne, and for some reason, I wanted to ask him what brand it was.

When the kiss ended, he lifted his head, breathing lightly, his eyes shining as he looked at me.

I was still in a daze, staring at him blankly. "You..."

"I really like you, Caroline."

Being confessed to in such a situation felt surreal.

Outside the door, people were bustling about, but inside, it was just the two of us, with an intimate atmosphere lingering in the room.

I coughed. "Who gave you permission to kiss me?"

"No one. I just wanted to."

I was silent for a moment, pressing my lips that still held his warmth.

"Next time, don't do that..."

What I didn't know was that my soft protest sounded like a playful complaint to him.

Royce's expression changed, and he kissed me again.

This time, I quickly pushed him away, and he looked at me with a hint of reluctance.

"Royce, what if someone comes in?"

"Alright, I'll listen to you."

I glared at him, wondering why a simple sentence from him always seemed to carry another meaning.

After thinking for a moment, I decided to ask the question that had been on my mind. "By the way, what cologne are you wearing? It smells really nice."

Royce was taken aback. "You've been thinking about that?"

"Yeah, why?"

I saw a hint of helplessness on Royce's face, as if he was amused.

"You..."

He stood up and shook his suit jacket. "I don't wear cologne."

With that, he turned and left.

I could still smell the lingering scent, but I really thought it smelled nice. Why wouldn't he tell me?

That evening, the bidding event concluded. We had to evaluate the strengths of several companies before making a choice.

Coincidentally, the two strongest contenders were Alfonso's company and Royce's company.

The other companies either lacked qualifications or had financial issues, among other reasons.

Of course, I couldn't make any suggestions, so I could only hope in my heart that Royce's company would win the bid.

Until the results were announced, I couldn't meet with Royce and his team.

Instead, Alfonso started calling me again.

"Ms. Sharp, as far as I know, our two companies are the most likely to win the bid, right?"

It seemed Alfonso had someone inside the company feeding him information. How else could he know everything so clearly?

I sneered. "That's none of your concern. Just wait for the news."

"I heard Mr. Carr has already prepared a celebration party? Isn't that a bit too confident?"

"I have my ways. You don't need to worry about me, Ms. Sharp."

"The only thing I'm curious about is, do you really not care about your child's well-being?"

"Or is this project more important to you than your child?"

I leaned back in my chair. "Think what you want. If you think you can get this project through me, you're mistaken. If you have the strength, the project will naturally be yours. Otherwise, you wouldn't resort to these tactics, right?"

Alfonso fell silent. He knew he lacked the strength and was trying to manipulate me.

If he had the capability, he wouldn't need to resort to such measures.

"Ms. Sharp, don't be so sure of yourself."

I sneered. "I wonder who's being overconfident here."

It was clear Alfonso didn't know that my child was already back with me. I wondered where his blind confidence came from.

I hung up the phone and went home.

Kelly was holding the baby, who had just returned, and soothing him. When she saw me, she said, "This child is much more well-behaved than you were. He eats and sleeps, and then eats again."

"He only cried a bit when he first came back yesterday, but now he's not crying anymore."

I put down my bag and looked at the baby. He was sleeping soundly, looking adorable.

"I was well-behaved as a child too, wasn't I?"

"No way. You gave your dad and me a hard time. You cried whenever you woke up, and we had to keep soothing you."

"We even thought about having another child to keep you company, but then we decided against it. One like you was enough."

I smiled helplessly. Just then, the baby woke up and looked at me with wide eyes.

I wiggled my finger in front of him, making him laugh.

His eyes sparkled.

I couldn't help but marvel at the wonders of genetics. The moment I saw him, I knew he was my child.

And it seemed the baby knew this was his home too. He was adapting quickly, no longer crying like before, and his emotions were stabilizing.

That evening, Carl called me. "Ms. Sharp, we have two companies as finalists for the bid. Which one do you prefer?"

"Both are companies from Skyview City. I heard one of them has a connection with you..."

"Carl, I'm not getting involved in this. If I do, people might think I'm manipulating things because of my connection with that company. To avoid such trouble, I'm staying out of it."

"Just choose based on their strengths. Even if you pick the other company, it's fine."

Carl was taken aback, then nodded. "Alright, I understand."

After hanging up, I couldn't help but worry about Asher, hoping he would win the bid.

So I called him. "Asher? How do you feel about your chances?"

"Honestly, it's hard to say, but our company is pretty strong."

Hearing that made me laugh. I admired Asher's confidence.

"It's good to have that confidence. Asher, you don't blame me for not helping, do you?"

"Caroline, what are you thinking? It's right for you to be cautious in your position."

"Besides, do you think I'm useless? I can handle things without your help."

###chapter 243

Hearing Asher say that really put my mind at ease because I knew he genuinely didn't mind.

I had been so worried that this issue might create a rift between us.

"Alright, Asher, just chill. I know you got this."

"Don't stress."

"Don't worry, Caroline. I've been ready for this. Whether we nail it or not, I'll deal with it. It's just a project."

I couldn't help but nod and chuckle, "Right, just a project."

After submitting the proposal, we anxiously waited for a while. Finally, the day of the bid announcement arrived.

I was super nervous and couldn't bear to look, so I asked Royce to check and then tell me.

When I saw his call, I closed my eyes and carefully answered, "Hey, did you see the results?"

Royce's voice was low, "Yeah."

"Are you nervous?"

I took a deep breath, "How could I not be? I'm about to die from the nerves."

He chuckled softly, "What result are you hoping for?"

"Of course, I hope Asher wins the bid."

He paused for a moment and then said, "Congrats, your wish came true."

I widened my eyes in disbelief and took a moment to react, "You mean Asher won the bid?"

"Yep, he did."

"That's fantastic!" I was overjoyed, grinning from ear to ear.

"Let's have dinner to celebrate Asher's success!"

"We can't let such a good day go uncelebrated, can we?"

"Alright, I'll tell him. He's probably over the moon right now too."

After hanging up, I couldn't stop smiling.

Even Kathy and Savannah noticed something was up and asked, "What's going on with you? Why are you so happy?"

I smirked proudly, "Of course, it's because Asher won the bid. Alfonso didn't get his way. It's a double win for me."

Kelly joined in the excitement, "Asher? He's really something. I was actually thinking of setting you two up, but then I saw you weren't interested, so I dropped it."

"Really? You thought about that?"

Kelly just smiled without saying anything.

A while later, I suddenly received a call from Alfonso.

He sounded desperate, "Caroline, you just won't give me this project, will you?"

"Have you forgotten about your son?"

"I'm telling you, you'll never see your son again."

"I gave you a chance, but you didn't take it. Just wait!"

Listening to him, I let out a cold laugh, "Alfonso, you're way too confident. Who gave you the guts to threaten me?"

"To be honest, I went back to Skyview City before the bidding started. Guess what I did?"

"Could it be..."

Alfonso's voice faltered, as if he realized something.

"Live in your delusional world. I already brought my son back."

"Did you think only you could find him? He's my son. There's no way I couldn't find him."

"Your threats don't work on me."

"You... just wait."

Realizing his threats were useless, he hung up.

But I hadn't forgotten what he did to Celestia, so I knew he wouldn't give up on his schemes.

I stayed vigilant and prepared.

Sure enough, that evening, there was a surge of online rumors.

By the time I noticed, it had already become a trending topic.

The content exposed my position as a shareholder in both companies, accusing me of using my influence to rig the bidding process.

The online uproar grew, making it seem all too real.

The joy of the celebration dinner vanished. I looked at the online rumors and just sneered.

Of course, this was Alfonso's doing. Losing the project must have made him furious.

With no other options, he tried to drag Asher and me down with him.

Carl also noticed the rumors and called to ask what to do.

I said, "See? This is what happens when I don't get involved. People still talk. If I had been involved, it would have been worse."

"But don't worry. Just continue with the cooperation process. I'll handle this."

Hearing this, he nodded, "If you need anything, just let me know."

"Alright, thanks."

After hanging up, I tapped my fingers on the desk, thinking about how to respond.

Soon, Royce called, "Did you see the news online?"

I nodded, "Yeah, it's definitely Alfonso's doing."

"He couldn't get the project, so he's resorting to underhanded tactics."

Royce scoffed.

"Right, but it's okay. I can handle it for now."

"I'll have both companies issue a statement saying I wasn't involved in the negotiations and that it was a normal business decision."

"Good idea, but be aware that this project is highly sought after. Many companies are upset about losing, so they might join in on this."

"The controversy won't stop here. It might get worse. Be prepared."

"Don't worry, I'm ready."

"Good, I'll help you too."

For some reason, Royce's words reassured me, making the situation seem less daunting.

As Royce predicted, the controversy escalated.

There were even calls to revoke Asher's company's winning bid.

People were protesting outside Asher's company, and the issue remained a top trend on Twitter.

Carl asked if we should suppress the rumors, but I refused.

If they want to escalate it, let them.

However, I had Carl issue a statement on behalf of the company, clarifying that Asher's company was chosen based on merit, not personal connections.

But the angry public didn't buy it, believing it was due to my personal influence.

They argued that a highway project being influenced by personal connections was too dangerous.

Some even demanded the bid be given to Alfonso's company.

Of course, there were also rational voices, comparing the companies' strengths and posting fair comments.

"The winning company is actually quite capable. I don't understand what the protest is about."

###chapter 244

Of course, those comments got reported and taken down pretty fast.

Even at home, the rumors had some impact. Holly, who usually didn't pay attention to this stuff, had come across some of those short videos.

She started getting into conspiracy theories.

"Ms. Sharp, the internet is full of people trashing us."

I was casually scrolling through my phone when she said that, and I raised an eyebrow. "Holly, you saw it too?"

"Yeah, they're saying we're manipulating the market, running some kind of family business, trying to privatize national projects like highways, and all that..."

"Don't worry, none of what they're saying is true."

"Of course, I know it's not true, but shouldn't we come out and explain?"

"The comments under the videos are really nasty."

I got up and patted Holly's shoulder reassuringly. "Don't worry, I've got this. I'll handle it."

She nodded, still looking worried.

I understood her concern. The online comments were indeed harsh, and my calm demeanor might seem odd.

But I believed there was no need to explain.

We had nothing to hide. The more we explained, the more it would seem like we had something to cover up, indirectly proving there was an issue.

So, staying silent was the best approach.

Of course, I wasn't going to let Alfonso off the hook. I had Simon and his team find out that their company had paid for a lot of online accounts to push this issue into the spotlight, so I had to expose it.

Asher called to ask if we should still hold the celebration party amidst all this chaos.

I didn't hesitate to nod. Of course, we should. The more they tried to bring us down, the more we needed to show our strength.

Canceling the party would only make us look guilty and give them more to talk about.

So, on the day of the celebration, a crowd of reporters surrounded the hotel entrance, making it impossible to get in or out.

The hotel manager apologized and asked us to address the reporters outside, as it was affecting their business.

I nodded and walked out.

"I've prepared another venue for the reporters. Please follow me, and I'll hold a small press conference where you can ask any questions."

"Trust me, you'll get reasonable answers."

The reporters followed me to the other venue, cameras flashing non-stop. I stood on the stage, looking down at them with a calm expression.

"Regarding the recent online rumors about our company, we've been aware of them. However, since they are baseless, we haven't responded."

"If you compare the capabilities of the companies that participated in the bidding, you'll see that our company winning the bid is beyond question. The online rumors are completely unfounded."

A reporter quickly asked, "Another company with similar capabilities didn't win the bid. Why did your company win? Isn't there some shady deal involved? You're a shareholder in both companies, right? This seems too coincidental."

I took a deep breath and looked the reporter straight in the eye. "Our company won the bid fair and square. The decision was based on our track record, our proposal, and our ability to deliver. As for the other company, they simply didn't meet the criteria as well as we did. And no, there's no shady deal. Everything was done by the book."

Another reporter chimed in, "But what about the allegations that you're trying to privatize national projects?"

I shook my head. "That's just another baseless rumor. Our goal is to improve infrastructure, not to take it over. We're working in partnership with the government, not against it."

The room buzzed with more questions, but I held up my hand. "Look, I understand there's a lot of speculation out there. But the truth is, we're committed to transparency and integrity. If anyone has any concrete evidence of wrongdoing, they should bring it forward. Otherwise, these rumors are just that-rumors."

With that, I stepped down from the stage, leaving the reporters to mull over my words. I knew this wouldn't be the end of it, but at least we had made our stance clear.

"The highway project concerns the safety of our entire city. We can't let a project like this fall into the hands of people like you."

His words were sharp, clearly with an agenda.

When he mentioned the other company, I immediately understood that Alfonso had arranged this.

I knew many people were live-streaming this, and my every move would be scrutinized.

So, I had to be extremely careful. Any slight misstep would be magnified and maliciously interpreted.

I played a recording of Alfonso threatening my child, his voice clear.

"Precisely because of the safety of the city's residents, we didn't give the project to such a company."

"Due to personal reasons, my child has been away, and we haven't seen each other."

"He used this to try to force me to give him the bid."

The recording caused an uproar. No one expected such a story behind this.

This was far more interesting than a typical business battle. The sound of cameras clicking intensified as reporters hurried to capture every detail, not wanting to miss a second of this breaking news.

"So, please believe that I didn't give in even in such a moment, and I certainly wouldn't let my company win the bid for a small benefit."

"I know this might sound self-righteous, but after he threatened me, I found my child."

"I couldn't allow the project to be taken by someone who threatens others."

"Regarding the recent online rumors, they were all orchestrated by that company."

"We have evidence that they paid for numerous online accounts to spread these rumors. We will sue them for defamation. And to the reporter who asked earlier, I believe you were sent by Alfonso, right?"

"Please go back and tell him his plan failed. I will never, ever give in to him."

My words were met with applause.

I smiled slightly, knowing I had resolved the issue smoothly.

Sometimes, a sincere response is more effective than over-explaining. This was a method I had long mastered.

After the small press conference, it was time for the company's celebration party.

I invited the remaining reporters to join us, maintaining their goodwill, as you never know when you might need them.

Asher, in a suit that highlighted his muscular build, approached me.

"Caroline, I was watching your live stream. You handled it beautifully."

"It's because we didn't abuse our power. We have nothing to hide."

"If we had abused our power to get the project, I wouldn't have shown up today."

"So, thank you, Asher, for winning this project on merit."

We exchanged a knowing smile.

I looked around. "Where's Royce? Why isn't he here?"

"He is here. Not sure where he went, though. I saw him earlier."

I nodded and didn't say anything.

To fit into the form-fitting dress I was wearing, I hadn't eaten much all day and was starving.

I reached for a dessert on the table, and as I took a bite, I noticed Royce out of the corner of my eye.

He was standing by a couch, chatting with a woman.

I didn't know her, but they seemed to be getting along well.

###chapter 245

I cleared my throat and looked away.

Even though I knew I had no right to be jealous given my current status, I couldn't help but feel a bit uncomfortable. I wasn't sure where this discomfort was coming from.

To avoid it, I pretended not to see anything.

I busied myself, shoving small pastries into my mouth one after another until my stomach was full and my mind stopped wandering.

After I was full, I sighed contentedly.

Just then, I saw Royce walking towards me. Instinctively, I wanted to hide, so I ducked behind Asher.

Royce's face turned slightly cold as he approached and grabbed my arm. "Why are you hiding?"

I waved my hand dismissively. "When did I hide? I wasn't hiding."

He frowned slightly. "Then come with me."

"I have something to discuss with Asher. Weren't you just chatting happily with others? Go back to them."

My attitude seemed to annoy Royce, and he dragged me forward forcefully.

I looked to Asher for help, but he just shrugged, indicating he couldn't do anything.

I let Royce pull me along, but his grip was so strong it hurt. I couldn't help but squirm. "Let go, Royce. It really hurts."

He paused, then slowly released his grip and looked back at me. "Why are you avoiding me?"

"I told you, I'm not avoiding you. Can't I have something to discuss with Asher?"

"If you weren't avoiding me, why did you run when you saw me?"

I had no response because, at that moment, I had indeed instinctively wanted to avoid Royce.

"Why are you being so difficult? Weren't things fine before?"

I frowned. "What do you mean by 'being difficult'? Are you saying I'm being unreasonable?"

Royce took a deep breath. "That's not what I meant. But can you tell me what's wrong?"

I didn't know why I was so angry, but I couldn't control my emotions.

"I said nothing's wrong."

I abruptly pulled my hand away and turned to leave.

I didn't notice Royce's gaze on me as I sat in a corner, angrily taking off my high heels and catching my breath.

I didn't know why I was so upset. Royce hadn't done anything wrong. Maybe he just said something offhand, but I took it seriously.

I sat in the corner for a long time, trying to calm down. Maybe my emotions were triggered by the discomfort of my high heels. In any case, my emotions were too easily stirred.

Just then, I saw Royce walking over.

He stood in the light, blocking all the glaring lights, and looked down at me. "Still mad?"

I suddenly felt like my earlier behavior was unreasonable. I shook my head lightly.

The only stubbornness I had left was keeping my head down, refusing to look at him.

Royce didn't seem to mind. He crouched down and handed me a band-aid. "Here, put this on."

I was stunned and looked at him in disbelief.

Seeing that I didn't take the band-aid, he sighed, lifted one of my feet, and carefully applied the band-aid to the spot that was most rubbed raw.

I felt a bit embarrassed and tried to move my foot, but he held my ankle firmly. "Don't move."

I coughed lightly. "What are you doing? There are so many people here."

"I'm just putting on a band-aid. Don't move."

He carefully finished with one foot and then did the same with the other.

The seriousness in his eyes made it hard for me to look directly at the emotions in his gaze.

When he was done, I cautiously pulled my foot back.

He looked up at me. "All done."

I nodded and whispered, "Thank you."

Royce raised an eyebrow. "What did you say? I didn't hear you."

"I said thank you."

In this moment, it really seemed like my earlier outburst was unreasonable.

I felt even more embarrassed.

"Your voice is too soft. I can't hear you."

I couldn't help but glare at him. "Are you picking a fight on purpose?"

I noticed he was smiling playfully.

He then sat next to me and asked, "What was that all about earlier?"

How could I admit I was being unreasonable? I just shook my head.

"Nothing. Don't worry about it. I was just feeling a bit down thinking about Alfonso. It wasn't about you. I'm sorry."

I apologized softly to Royce, who raised an eyebrow but said nothing.

Just as I was about to say something else, the woman who had been chatting with Royce earlier suddenly walked over.

"Royce, who is this?"

I didn't know what Royce would say, so I quickly answered, "I'm his friend. Nice to meet you."

Because I answered so quickly, Royce's face turned slightly cold, but he nodded.

I felt a pang of disappointment. I must be crazy. Wasn't I the one who said I was just his friend? Why was I feeling disappointed?

"Nice to meet you. Royce never mentioned his friends to me."

I looked at Royce. "And you are?"

"A classmate a year below him, Yvonne."

"Nice to meet you. I'm Caroline, an old high school friend of his."

"So you're the same age as Royce? Can I call you sister?"

I nodded. "By age, I suppose I am your sister. You can call me that."

"Nice to meet you, sister. Royce and I have something to discuss privately. Could you give us a moment?"

I was taken aback but nodded. "Sure, I'll leave you to it."

I stood up, ready to leave.

Just then, Royce grabbed my wrist. "Where are you going?"

I glanced at Yvonne and forced a smile. "Yvonne has something to discuss with you. I shouldn't be here."

Royce frowned slightly. "Sit down. Are your feet okay?"

I looked at Yvonne, unsure of what to do.

Yvonne glanced at Royce and then smiled. "If Royce wants you to stay, then stay. It's fine."

So I awkwardly sat back down, trying to make myself as inconspicuous as possible.

I didn't notice Royce frowning again, looking at me with some dissatisfaction.

"Royce, I ran into our professor the other day. He said he misses you and wants you to visit him abroad. When are you going back?"

I listened to their conversation, feeling a bit down. I thought, I really don't belong in this conversation. I should have just left earlier.

That was a part of Royce's college life, which had nothing to do with me.

"I'll call him when I get a chance. I'll visit him sometime."

Royce's face was indifferent as he nodded casually.

Yvonne didn't give up and continued their conversation. "Royce, do you remember that foreign girl who had a crush on you back in school?"

###chapter 246

"Don't remember, why?"

Royce glanced at me briefly, his voice still flat.

"She's married now. Remember when she confessed to you? The whole school knew, but you just ignored her."

Yvonne suddenly burst into laughter, leaning on Royce's shoulder with a clear, ringing laugh.

"Back then, everyone thought you might be gay since you're still single."

"By the way, why did you turn her down? Her family had money, and she was really pretty too."

I found myself looking at Royce, inexplicably curious about the answer.

To my surprise, Royce met my gaze and slowly smiled. "Because I liked someone else at the time."

Yvonne was stunned. "Who?"

Royce shook his head and didn't say anything.

"That must be over now, right, Royce?" Yvonne asked cautiously, looking at him.

I could clearly see that Yvonne liked Royce. When he mentioned he had someone he liked, her face showed obvious disappointment.

"No, I still like her."

Yvonne was taken aback, almost at a loss for words.

Royce, breaking his usual silence, continued, "I don't know if she'd give me a chance. She keeps running away, and I can't figure out what she's thinking."

"If I could, I'd like to know what's on her mind. I can tell she likes me too, so why does she keep avoiding me?"

I clenched my dress, knowing those words were meant for me, but I didn't know what to say.

Yvonne's eyes, which had been bright, dimmed. She was so young and vibrant, the kind of person who seemed perfect for Royce.

As for me? Did I really deserve this relationship?

Doubt filled my heart.

"Excuse me, I need to step out for a moment."

Royce stood up, adjusted his perfectly tailored suit, and spoke to Yvonne.

Before leaving, Royce's gaze briefly fell on me, and he nodded slightly.

I said nothing, watching him leave.

After Royce left, Yvonne suddenly looked at me. "Royce likes you, doesn't he?"

I was taken aback and didn't respond.

"I know you. Your divorce with Brandon was all over the place; everyone knows you."

"If I remember correctly, you have a few kids, right?"

I nodded. "You're right."

"Do you think someone like you deserves Royce? He's young, successful, and has always kept himself clean. Why would he like a divorced woman like you?"

"If I were you, I'd stay away from Royce and not stick around him."

I frowned, listening to her.

"Why?"

"Why should I listen to you? Who are you?"

"If you have the ability, go change Royce's mind instead of trying to push me away by belittling me."

"Are you mad? It's someone like me who beat you."

I stood up, looking down at Yvonne. Her face was indeed young, but also arrogant and annoying.

"If I'm not mistaken, you like Royce too, right?"

"And yet, it's me, the one you belittled, who won Royce's heart. Aren't you ashamed?"

"You..."

Yvonne glared at me, her eyes burning with jealousy.

"You think you've really won Royce's heart? He's just caught up in the moment with you. Once the passion fades, he'll leave you without a second thought."

I chuckled. "Really? That's none of your concern."

"At least I have his momentary passion, which is more than you have."

I walked away in my high heels, not bothering to look at Yvonne's expression.

I entered the venue and looked around.

For this celebration, I had invited Kathy and Savannah, but they insisted on getting all dolled up, so they hadn't arrived yet.

Just then, the door opened, and Savannah walked in wearing a women's suit, looking particularly sharp and confident, while Kathy wore a gown that highlighted her allure.

Seeing them felt like seeing family. I rushed into their arms. "Why are you guys so late?"

"What's wrong? Did someone mess with you?"

I hung my head, feeling down.

To be honest, Yvonne's words had affected me.

"Someone bullied you on your turf? Tell me who, and I'll deal with them right now."

I shook my head and sighed. "Forget it, I'm really tired. I'm going to rest for a bit."

I glanced back and saw Yvonne standing next to Royce, chatting and laughing without a care.

Noticing my gaze, she smiled at me smugly.

I turned away and headed to the lounge.

Maybe it was my glance, but Savannah and Kathy noticed Yvonne hovering around Royce. They exchanged a look.

While I wasn't paying attention, they approached Yvonne.

"Who are you?"

"I checked the guest list, and you weren't on it. How did you get in?"

Kathy crossed her arms, looking Yvonne up and down with a cold snort.

Yvonne's face turned sour. "Royce is here, so I came."

She linked her arm with Royce's, as if claiming him, but Royce subtly pulled away.

"Where's Caroline? Isn't she with you two?"

Savannah shook her head. "Caroline said she's tired and went to the lounge."

Kathy turned to Royce. "You should go. Now's your chance to make a good impression."

Royce hesitated. "But she just..."

"If you don't go, you'll regret it."

Royce nodded and turned to leave.

Just then, Yvonne called out, jealousy flashing in her eyes. "Royce, I'm not familiar with this place. Can you stay with me a bit longer?"

Royce shook his head firmly. "Sorry, Yvonne, I have something important to do. If I don't go, I'll regret it."

"But if you're bored, you can leave early."

"This celebration was for you, since you said you were having trouble adjusting after coming back. If you're still uncomfortable, just go home."

With that, Royce left.

Kathy covered her mouth, laughing. "Royce really knows how to talk."

"Miss, did you say something to Caroline earlier?"

Yvonne's eyes were full of resentment. "I didn't say anything. It's not my fault if she can't handle it."

###chapter 247

I walked into the break room, exhausted, and kicked off my shoes before collapsing onto the leather couch.

The leather couch wasn't breathable, so it wasn't very comfortable, but I was too tired to care.

My body and mind were both drained.

I covered my eyes with the back of my hand to block out the light, hoping to catch a nap.

Just then, I heard the door open and footsteps approaching.

I didn't move my hand, pretending to be asleep.

I knew who it was just by the sound of the footsteps-Royce.

I couldn't let him see my vulnerable state, so I chose to fake sleep to avoid the awkwardness.

Royce turned off the lights, leaving only the faint glow from the window to illuminate the room.

I could feel him standing next to me, watching me, so I stayed perfectly still.

He leaned down, and my heart started racing.

What was he going to do? I had no idea.

I wanted to open my eyes to see what Royce was up to, but I knew that would ruin my act.

So, I kept my eyes shut tight, hoping he would leave soon.

But he didn't move. After a while, I felt something cool brush against my face-it was Royce.

He gently moved a strand of hair from my face, and I thought he might finally leave.

I exhaled quietly, but then I felt his breath getting closer, warmer.

He was so close I could almost feel his presence.

My heart pounded faster, and I didn't know what to do.

Then, I felt a soft kiss on my lips.

I was shocked but couldn't react, so I just endured it.

He finally stood up and walked towards the door.

I was sure he was leaving, and my heart started to calm down.

Thank goodness I didn't open my eyes, or that kiss would have left me completely flustered.

I heard the door open and close.

I let out a long breath and opened my eyes.

"Caught you, you're not asleep."

I flinched and quickly shut my eyes again.

Royce walked over, "Stop pretending. I saw you open your eyes. If you keep pretending, I'll kiss you again."

I opened my eyes and glared at him, "What were you doing just now?"

"Stealing a kiss while you were asleep. Would you let me kiss you if you were awake?"

I blushed, realizing he knew I was pretending.

"Wait, you knew I was pretending and still kissed me?"

Royce shrugged, "Of course. It would be creepy to kiss you while you were actually asleep."

He always had a way of making things sound reasonable, leaving me speechless.

"You can't kiss me again. What are we, anyway?"

He didn't answer, just shook his head in protest.

"What does that mean?" I asked, frowning.

Royce just pressed his lips together, refusing to speak.

I was exasperated, "I'm asking you to explain."

"I can't promise not to kiss you. You're gonna be my girlfriend, then my wife, and we'll spend our lives together."

Suddenly, I understood how wonderful it felt to be part of someone's life plan.

I had never been chosen so firmly before. Hearing Royce say that almost brought me to tears.

But then I remembered the gap between us, and Yvonne, who was so vibrant and young.

They were a perfect match, while I felt old and worn out.

I felt a wave of sadness.

If only I had met Royce earlier, if only...

But life doesn't work that way, and there are no do-overs.

I stayed silent, looking down.

Royce seemed to sense my mood and frowned, "What's on your mind?"

"Are you upset because of Yvonne?"

I was startled and looked at Royce, wondering how he knew what I was thinking.

But I couldn't admit it, so I shook my head, "Of course not."

Royce sighed and put his arm around my shoulders, "Don't pretend. I'm not an idiot. I can tell how you feel."

"Do you dislike Yvonne? Or do you dislike her being around me?"

I stayed silent, staring at the floor, trying to avoid the topic.

"So it's the latter. If it were the former, you would have said so."

"No, I don't dislike Yvonne. I don't dislike her being around you. I'm just feeling down, okay?"

"Of course, that's fine. I'm just trying to understand your feelings."

"You're hard to read, so I need a few chances to get it right."

"Hypothetically, if you don't like Yvonne being around me..."

I glared at him, and he quickly added, "Just hypothetically. Are you so possessive you can't even entertain a hypothetical?"

I had to give in.

"Hypothetically, if you don't like Yvonne being around me, it means you like me, right?"

"So, you came to the break room because you couldn't stand seeing Yvonne with me, which means you really like me."

"But why run away? You should have grabbed me in front of everyone and kissed me to claim me as yours."

He stroked his chin, looking serious.

I was embarrassed that he had guessed my feelings, but his over-the-top analysis made me laugh, "Do you think this is a soap opera? I'm thirty."

He looked smug, "So I was right. You do like me and can't stand Yvonne being around me!"

His confident statement made me realize I had said too much, so I quickly shut my mouth.

"Alright, stop biting your lip. If you need to bite something, bite my finger."

He touched my lips with his cool fingers, making me release my lip.

I gave him a helpless look, "Your analysis is way off. I just fell into your trap."

"Stop guessing."

If this continued, he would figure out all my secrets, and that scared me.

###chapter 248

"Alright, alright, I admit it, I was wrong. I was just talking nonsense, okay?"

He gave a resigned smile. "Actually, that's what I want to do with you."

"But Caroline, you clearly like me too. Why do you keep running away?"

His sincere eyes looked at me, leaving me speechless.

I sighed in defeat. "Fine, what good does admitting it do?"

"I do like you. From the moment we met again, my heart skipped a beat."

"But I already have four kids. No ordinary man would want a single mom with four kids, let alone you, Royce."

"You're an outstanding single man, the object of every girl's affection in town. It's only natural that someone like Yvonne would like you."

"You should be with them, enjoying a youthful romance."

"But my soul is old and weary, devoid of the passion it once had. I shouldn't hold you back."

Saying this, I felt a weight lift off my chest.

I pretended to be nonchalant, watching Royce's eyes grow serious. I shrugged lightly. "There, isn't that what you wanted to hear? I've said it all."

"We're not right for each other, really."

I looked at him earnestly.

"Says who?"

Royce grabbed my hand and placed it on his chest.

"Do you know why my heart beats so slowly? Because it aches for you."

"I didn't realize you were carrying so much pressure. I didn't consider it. There's a natural difference in how men and women think."

"I thought if I loved you and was with you, we could overcome anything."

"But I was wrong. I ignored your feelings..."

I stared at him in disbelief, not expecting him to say all this, leaving me at a loss for words.

"I..."

I opened my mouth but didn't know what to say.

"So from today, I'm officially pursuing you, okay?"

"Until the moment you feel something for me, then we'll be together."

"Don't feel burdened. In this world, it's only about whether I'm worthy of you, never the other way around. That's a false premise, a lie, it never existed."

I stared at him, my eyes filling with tears.

Some words, when said like this, can be so moving.

"Royce, I..."

"Save your rejection for later."

He stepped forward, wrapping me in his arms, then chuckled softly. "How can you say there's no passion? Your soul is clearly alive."

"Listen, your heart is beating for me."

Then he placed my hand on his rapidly beating heart. "From now on, my heart beats only for you, okay?"

I knew I couldn't say another word to reject Royce. No one could refuse such a confession.

I clung to his neck, sobbing uncontrollably. "Thank you, Royce."

I didn't know why I was thanking him, maybe for being someone who would firmly choose me, even as I am now.

How could I not be grateful?

Royce seemed to understand. His voice carried a hint of a choke, yet he tried to stay strong and calm. "Alright, what do you think of my proposal? To pursue you."

"Isn't it cool?"

He joked, and I nodded heavily. "Okay, I accept your proposal."

He was stunned for a moment, then pulled me into a tight hug, his hands gently rubbing my shoulders.

"Good, as long as you agree."

I pulled away, wiping my tears, feeling a bit embarrassed. "Your suit, I got it all wet."

He shook his head, unconcerned, and used his sleeve to wipe the tears from the corners of my eyes. "You're like a fountain, where do all these tears come from?"

His cool fingers touched my swollen, hot eyelids. "Seriously, where do they all come from? Can I see?"

I couldn't help but laugh at his curious expression.

Royce laughed too. "I don't get you, crying one minute, laughing the next."

"It's all your fault. My eyelids are swollen because of you. What am I supposed to do when I go out?"

"Do I have to be laughed at by everyone? Especially Savannah and Kathy, you have no idea how gossipy they are!"

"They'll think I was moved to tears by a proposal!"

I could almost imagine Savannah and Kathy's looks, staring at me, winking.

"What's up, Caroline? Did you get proposed to? Why are you crying like this?"

"Maybe, Caroline is always so strong, rarely cries. It must be a proposal to make her eyes this red."

Royce's thumb pressed on my eyelid, gently massaging.

He knelt in front of me, seriously gazing at me. "Don't worry, I won't let Savannah laugh at you. She wouldn't dare."

I glared at him. "Stop it. Savannah is my sister now. I've already considered her family. You can't treat her like a subordinate anymore, got it?"

He didn't say anything, still massaging my eyes.

I pushed his hand away, looking at him seriously. "I'm talking to you, did you hear me?"

Royce sighed helplessly. "Got it, Caroline."

"The whole world is your family, except me."

His voice carried a faint hint of grievance, making me want to laugh again.

"That depends on your performance."

"Now, your first task is to help me get rid of these swollen eyes."

Royce smiled. "Yes, ma'am."

He got up and left, returning shortly with a blanket and a bottle of cold water.

He draped the blanket over me, then placed the cold water on my eyelids.

The cool temperature on my hot eyelids felt incredibly soothing.

I lay down, letting Royce take care of me.

And Royce diligently massaged my eyelids until they returned to normal.

"Alright, Caroline, are you satisfied?"

He handed me a mirror from who knows where. I looked and saw no trace of crying.

But I couldn't let Royce be too pleased, so I pretended to be dissatisfied and nodded. "It's the best you can do, I guess."

Royce laughed, pointing at my forehead. "You really know how to give me a hard time."

"I did my best."

I huffed, then threw off the blanket and stood up. "Well, that's that. What else can I do?"

Royce shook his head helplessly. "Asher told me he came by earlier. Do you want to see him? He's probably been waiting for you outside for a while. Crybaby."

###chapter 249

I nodded right away. "Of course, I want to see him. Asher landed this project, and I gotta congratulate him in person. This is our first time meeting since the bidding."

I jumped up, ready to head out.

Royce wasn't too happy about it. He scoffed, "You're way more excited to see Asher than me. That's messed up."

"Asher's like an older brother who watched me grow up. You're just my high school buddy. Don't get ahead of yourself, Royce!"

He frowned but kept quiet. He opened the door for me without a word.

We walked out together, and I told Royce not to follow me. If Savannah and the others saw us, they'd definitely start gossiping.

But Royce wasn't having it. "First, you give me the cold shoulder, and now you don't want me to walk with you?"

"You're too much, Caroline. Use me and then toss me aside, is that it?"

His words made me feel like a total drama queen. I was a bit taken aback.

Seeing his determined look, I knew he wouldn't let me go without an explanation.

I sighed and waved him over.

He came over like a puppy, offering his cheek. His contrasting demeanor made me smile.

I gave him a quick peck on the cheek, feeling a bit embarrassed. "Is that enough? Can I go now?"

Royce shook his head and pointed to his lips. "Not enough."

I pushed him away. "Cut it out. Don't forget we have nothing going on right now. Stop trying to take advantage!"

With that, I pushed him aside and walked into the venue.

I remembered Savannah, Kathy, and Yvonne were together before I left. Now, Savannah and Kathy were sitting on a couch, and Yvonne was nowhere to be seen.

Asher was chatting with others, so I decided to wait until he was free.

I headed over to Savannah and Kathy.

"What happened? Weren't you with Yvonne earlier?"

"Yvonne's got a weak psyche. I said a few things, and she ran to the bathroom," Kathy said, slowly eating a piece of fruit.

Savannah nodded. "Caroline, you should've seen Kathy. She was amazing."

"She had Yvonne so flustered she couldn't even respond."

I was a bit worried. "You guys should tone it down. After all, she's Royce's friend and was invited here. As my friends, you should be good hosts, not scare people away."

"So what? She was eyeing our host's man. I was just defending my friend," Kathy said, unapologetic.

I thought of Royce's earlier behavior and felt a bit embarrassed. "What man? Don't start rumors."

They immediately caught on. "By the way, Royce went to the lounge earlier. Judging by your lovestruck look, you two must've made some progress, right?"

"Did you clear up the misunderstanding? He and Yvonne really have nothing going on, right?"

Honestly, I hadn't even asked about it. I hadn't even considered it.

I trusted Royce so much that I never doubted him.

"Cut it out. He didn't mention it. I was just tired and needed a break."

"Doesn't look like it..." Kathy said, giving me a knowing look.

"Looks like someone's falling in love again..."

I playfully swatted her arm. "Kathy, your mouth is so annoying. Want me to kick you out?"

She laughed and didn't say anything more.

Just then, Asher walked over.

He had just finished chatting with his friends and saw me, so he came over.

"Caroline!"

"Asher!"

He called out, and I excitedly responded, standing up.

He raised his arms and walked over, giving me a big hug.

"Congratulations, Asher! I knew you could do it!"

"This project was made for you! Once it's done, our company will reach new heights!"

Asher nodded firmly. "Of course. This is your company too, so you deserve credit."

I quickly waved my hand. "I didn't participate at all this time. You did all the work. It has nothing to do with me."

Asher was being modest. I knew how much he had sacrificed for this project, even losing some muscle.

He smiled and scratched his head, not saying anything.

"By the way, this project still has some steps to go. I'll be in Suncrest City for another ten days or so. We can hang out more."

I nodded. "Yeah, after the celebration tonight, we won't leave until we're drunk. You can't escape!"

"Can you even drink now?" Asher asked with a smile.

I nodded. "Don't worry. I can handle it."

"That's great. It's been a while since we drank together."

I nodded, reminiscing about the old days.

Back then, I hadn't had kids yet. After work, we'd always go out drinking together.

Those were the happiest times. We felt young and ambitious, ready to conquer anything.

Now, I realized we weren't that old.

Thirty isn't a heavy age. It symbolizes a new beginning.

And I had more courage to face new challenges and love.

As we chatted, Kathy rolled her eyes. "You don't know, Savannah. We used to hang out after work all the time. Whenever Caroline and Asher talked about work, no one else could get a word in. It was like there was a wall between them."

"So we made a rule: no work talk during fun time."

"But sometimes they couldn't help it and would sneak off to the bathroom to talk."

Savannah laughed, curious. "How did you know?"

"Because they'd be gone for an hour. Who takes that long in the bathroom? I got impatient and found them chatting at the bathroom door."

Kathy rolled her eyes.

Asher and I laughed, reminiscing about the old days.

Just then, Royce walked out.

"Royce, after this, let's go to a bar and drink until we drop. I want to see what you're like drunk."

"I've known you for years and still don't know what you're like drunk."

###chapter 250

Royce glanced at Asher and chuckled, "You? Think you can outdrink me?"

His tone was dripping with sarcasm, which immediately riled Asher up.

"Who are you calling out? Tonight, I'm not stopping until you're completely wasted."

The two of them started bickering like kids, but the atmosphere was light and friendly.

After the celebration party, Yvonne hadn't shown up again. I wasn't sure if it was because of what Kathy and Savannah had said that made her leave.

But seeing Royce's face without any sign of concern, I felt relieved. After all, Yvonne was his friend.

The five of us headed to a nearby bar right after the party, not even bothering to change our clothes. Asher and Royce immediately started their drinking contest.

They were downing drinks one after another, not caring what they were drinking, both with a competitive glint in their eyes.

But I knew they were genuinely happy for each other. Their behavior tonight had no other meaning.

Watching them drink, I felt a sense of joy too.

It seemed like all the pent-up emotions from before were being released tonight. This was a cathartic moment for both of them.

The three of us sat nearby, occasionally glancing at Asher and Royce while chatting about our own stuff.

We had a great time that night, and it wasn't until midnight that we decided to call it a night.

We planned to get everyone home safely.

I called Asher and Royce's assistants to come pick them up.

Just then, Royce suddenly wrapped his arm around my neck, "Caroline, Caroline," he kept calling.

I was a bit annoyed and looked at him impatiently, "What is it? What do you want?"

Royce gave a goofy smile, "I really like you."

I was stunned, never expecting Royce to be like this when drunk.

I glanced back, relieved to see Savannah and Kathy busy trying to lift the deadweight that was Asher, not paying attention to us.

I poked Royce's forehead with my finger, "Shut up, don't say things like that!"

Royce pouted, looking a bit hurt, "Why?"

"There are so many people around, don't you have any shame?"

"We can talk about this later."

Maybe my words got through to him, as he nodded.

"Okay, then I'll secretly tell you I like you."

I sighed helplessly, seeing his assistant's car pull up. "Your ride's here, you should go."

I opened the car door and helped Royce into the back seat.

He was dead weight, and I struggled to move him, ending up half-falling into the back seat with him.

He held onto me and seemed to fall asleep.

I looked at the driver, feeling a bit helpless, "Could you give me a hand?"

The driver, surprised to see his boss in such a state, quickly got out to help me.

"How much did Mr. Castillo drink? I've never seen him like this before."

"Really? Royce never drinks this much?"

The driver shook his head firmly, "Never. Mr. Castillo has high standards for himself. Even at social events, he takes anti-hangover pills immediately."

"And he usually drinks very little. This is a first."

I looked at Royce in surprise, regretting not recording his drunken antics. He'd probably be mortified if he saw himself like this.

"Make sure he gets some anti-hangover medicine and some hot water when you get back," I told the driver.

The driver nodded, "Don't worry, Ms. Sharp, I'll take care of it."

Royce's car drove off, and I breathed a sigh of relief.

I helped Savannah and Kathy get Asher into his car and sent him off, then the three of us started our slow walk home. None of us had drunk much, so we were just a bit tipsy, enjoying the warm night breeze.

The night air in Suncrest City was warm, blowing away the smell of alcohol. We made our way home.

Kelly smelled the alcohol on us and looked a bit exasperated, "Did you guys drink?"

I nodded, hugging Kelly with a grin, "Yeah, we were celebrating. We had a few drinks."

"You have no idea how happy I am that Asher landed the project. It's like I landed it myself."

"How could I not be happy?"

"I think there's more to it than that," Kelly said, giving me a knowing look.

I coughed and quickly ran off, "I'm so tired, I need to sleep," avoiding Kelly's all-seeing gaze.

In the following days, Asher stayed in Suncrest City to handle the project's aftermath, and surprisingly, the usually busy Royce didn't leave either. He often hung out with us. For a while, I felt happier than I had in years.

Then, out of the blue, Isadora called me. She had given birth. The baby arrived earlier than expected, catching both her and her husband off guard. They rushed to the hospital, unprepared but excited.

Thankfully, Isadora hadn't gained much weight during her pregnancy, and the baby was small, so the delivery went smoothly and wasn't too painful.

When she video-called me, I saw the tiny baby snuggled beside her, looking adorable.

I laughed, "The baby looks just like you."

"Really? I think so too, but my husband insists the baby looks like him."

"Boy or girl?"

"Girl."

"Then your husband might be right. Girls often look like their dads."

"I don't believe it. I want my daughter to look like me. If she turns out as serious and stiff as him, it'll be a disaster."

Isadora stuck out her tongue, looking playful. She hadn't lost her youthful charm despite becoming a mother. Instead, she had gained a gentle, maternal glow, like she had transformed overnight. She was both youthful and maternal, and it didn't seem strange at all.

"Do you need me to come see you?"

"Not yet. I'm going to a postpartum care center to recover. I'm too messy to have visitors right now."

"Come visit after the baby turns one month old, okay?"

I nodded, smiling, "Of course, I'll bring a big gift for your baby."

Just then, Kathy leaned over, "Who's on the phone?"

I pointed to Isadora on the screen, "You clearly haven't been keeping up with Isadora. She just had her baby last night."

Kathy's eyes widened in shock, "How do you look even prettier after giving birth? And how did you recover so well?"

###chapter 251

"My mom always said giving birth to me was a nightmare. Not only was it a tough labor, but I had a huge head. You don't look like you went through anything like that."

"Even Caroline took forever to bounce back after having her baby."

Isadora smiled softly, looking down at her baby with eyes full of love.

"Even the doctor said I hit the genetic jackpot. This little one is a blessing, didn't cause me any pain at all."

"That's awesome! We'll definitely be there for the baby shower. Save us some seats, okay?"

Isadora nodded with a smile. "Don't worry, you guys will have seats for sure."

She glanced off-camera and frowned slightly. "My husband wants me to turn off my phone. We'll catch up later."

After hanging up, Kathy and I sighed. "Remember when Isadora was pregnant, and we saw her at her check-up? Now she's already had the baby. Time flies."

"Yeah, when we first met Isadora, she wasn't even showing yet."

"Hard to believe it's been almost six months," I nodded in realization. "You're right, six months ago, I never would have imagined I'd be where I am today."

We shared a knowing smile. The past hurts were still there, but I was learning to let them go.

A month later, Isadora was preparing for her baby's one-month celebration.

I was also getting ready to fly back to Skyview City.

Kathy had gone back two weeks earlier because of work, so we planned to meet up in Skyview City.

When Savannah and I got off the plane, we saw Isadora waiting for us. I was surprised. "How are you already up and about?"

Isadora waved her hand dismissively. "You have no idea. I've been cooped up in that postpartum center for days, haven't even seen the sun."

She exaggerated, making me laugh.

"Really? Not even a glimpse of the sun?"

"Seriously! My husband watches me like a hawk, even took time off to stay with me. He won't let me touch anything cold or go outside. I feel like a prisoner."

"I told him I wanted to sit in the garden and get some sun, but he flat-out refused. It drove me crazy."

I chuckled at her slightly rounder face. "You don't know how lucky you are."

"Come on, let's go see your baby."

She nodded, and we got into the car.

Her husband, Marshall, was driving, probably worried about Isadora, so he came along.

Isadora sat in the back with Savannah and me, chatting away, while Marshall drove.

We soon arrived at the postpartum center. The place was nice, clearly, Marshall spared no expense. But even if he hadn't, Isadora would have.

Postpartum care is crucial; if not done right, it can lead to lifelong health issues.

In Isadora's room, we saw her baby. The little one had grown a lot in a month, with a round head and chubby cheeks, absolutely adorable.

Marshall's face softened as he picked up the baby. "Hey there, my sweet girl. Did you miss me?"

The baby couldn't talk yet, just sucked on her fingers, looking cute as ever.

Every child goes through this phase, the cutest time before they grow up and start getting into mischief.

With my own kids, I knew this all too well.

They were still young, but soon enough, they'd find it hard to have any alone time.

Marshall put the baby down, and I picked her up, rocking her gently.

"Good girl, good girl."

Savannah, with her big hands and little experience, didn't get to hold the baby. She just watched curiously. "Do you know who I am?"

She made funny faces, trying to make the baby laugh, and I couldn't help but smile.

"When's the baby shower?"

"In a few days. Don't worry, everything's ready. Just need to finalize the guest list."

"What's so hard about the guest list?"

"Joanna's definitely coming, we're close. But I'm not sure about inviting her husband. We're not that familiar, and it might be awkward if he comes. But it feels weird not to invite him."

I thought for a moment. "Better not invite him. If you're not close, it'll be awkward. And he might feel uncomfortable too."

Isadora nodded. "You're right, let's not invite him."

"We'll just invite Joanna. He'll understand, it's no big deal."

Just then, Joanna arrived with Kathy.

"You're back? Just landed?"

I nodded. "Yeah, we couldn't wait to see the baby. She really looks like both of you, so cute."

They sat down, playing with the baby.

I gave Isadora a look, signaling it was the right time.

She cleared her throat. "Joanna, is it okay if we don't invite your husband to the baby shower? We're not that close, and it might be awkward."

Joanna didn't seem to mind at all. "That's fine. I was going to mention it. He's busy with a promotion, probably can't make it. And he's so serious and stiff, you wouldn't enjoy his company."

Relieved, we started discussing the details of the baby shower.

Having done this twice, I shared my tips on what to watch out for.

The most important part is the "grab" ceremony. Lay out some items the baby might like. It's more for fun, but if the baby grabs something useful, the parents will be thrilled.

After our discussion, Savannah and I headed back to the house I had bought.

On the way, I saw Maeve.

I hadn't seen her in ages, almost forgot about her.

Then I was shocked to see Maeve entering a hotel with a man I knew but wasn't close to-Joanna's husband.

###chapter 252

Thinking of Joanna, I instinctively stopped in my tracks, staring at the couple disappearing behind the hotel's automatic doors.

The hotel had large, transparent glass walls, and I could clearly see them walking to the front desk, seemingly checking in.

I hesitated for a moment.

Should I take a photo and send it to Joanna?

Although we weren't close to her husband, I never thought he would cheat on Joanna with another woman...

And with someone like Maeve!

Just then, Maeve suddenly turned her head in my direction.

Our eyes met.

I instinctively looked away and started to walk, but I knew Maeve had already seen me...

As I hesitated, I heard someone call out from behind.

"Caroline!"

Maeve had actually come after me.

I finally got a good look at her. She was wearing a sky-blue knit dress that accentuated her already seductive figure.

From the first time I saw Maeve at that party, I knew she wasn't a good person, especially after hearing all those rumors about her.

"Still playing the mistress role, Maeve?" I asked coldly, my tone dripping with disdain.

Maeve took a deep breath, stepped closer, and smiled. "Caroline, it's been a while, and you're still as feisty as ever."

"No wonder Brandon once said he should have poisoned you mute first; it would have made things much easier."

Hearing about Brandon's plot to harm me again after all this time still made my blood boil!

"Shut up. You had a thing with Brandon too, didn't you? Were you his mistress as well?"

Maeve just smiled without answering, sizing me up for a moment.

"Do you realize the consequences of sneaking around with Joanna's husband?" I couldn't help but ask, thinking of what I had just seen.

Maeve adjusted her bag and her curls, smiling sweetly. "I came out to tell you to mind your own business."

Her smile seemed to turn cold.

"It's a mutual arrangement. Joanna isn't like you. You divorced Brandon because he was a jerk, but Joanna might not leave her husband. It's better if she doesn't know about this."

I stared at Maeve suspiciously, unable to refute her words.

What she said...

But knowing Joanna's personality, I had to admit Maeve might be right.

"Think it over, Caroline. By the way, I got a call from Brandon recently. You actually got him thrown in jail. Impressive."

Maeve's words didn't make me happy at all.

Brandon deserved to be in jail, but it was for trespassing and theft, so he wouldn't be in for long. He'd probably be out soon.

Maeve leaned in and whispered in my ear, "Caroline, be careful. Brandon is desperate. He called me, begging for money to get him out. He's completely lost it!"

"Do you believe he won't come after you again? I have something that could help. If you keep today's events a secret from Joanna, we can make a deal."

Something? What kind of something?

Maeve's words left me puzzled. I was about to ask when she handed me a small piece of paper.

"This is my contact information."

She winked at me. "Remember, keep today's events a secret."

I stood there, feeling like I was in a cold sweat as Maeve walked away.

I had planned to give Maeve a piece of my mind, but now she had me on a leash.

But I was curious about what she had that could bring Brandon down...

Brandon definitely had secrets, and I knew he'd come after me again once he was out. I had considered this before.

But Maeve's words made me think of another possibility.

Why wait for things to happen before dealing with them?

If Brandon caused trouble again, I'd always be on the defensive!

If Maeve had something that could completely destroy Brandon, it would be a one-time solution...

On my way home, I kept thinking about these things.

I repeatedly opened my chat with Joanna but still didn't send a message.

When I got home, I planned to check on the kids first, but my phone suddenly buzzed.

Startled, I thought I had accidentally sent a message to Joanna. But it was a text from an unknown number.

I opened it and saw the words "old woman," immediately frowning as I read on.

[You old woman, how dare you hog Royce? Do you know how many people like him? You're divorced with kids, getting old and wrinkled. What makes you think you deserve him?!]

The audacity!

I smirked and kept reading. The messages were all in the same vein, attacking me from every angle, saying I didn't deserve Royce.

I quickly realized who it was from.

It was Yvonne from the recent party!

The young girl held grudges and had a sharp tongue.

I stared at the messages for a while, sighed, and didn't reply. But I didn't delete them either, keeping them just in case.

Who knows, she might cause trouble again?

Soon after, another message came from the same number, this time with a photo.

[Guess who I'm having dinner with?]

In the photo, a man sat across from her.

Even though his face wasn't visible, his demeanor and outfit made it clear it was Royce...

I clenched my phone, my heart sinking.

Just days ago, Royce had acted like a puppy around me, and I had fallen for his sweet talk.

He said he'd distance himself from Yvonne and other female friends, but now it seemed he was lying?

The thought left a bitter taste in my mouth.

I didn't reply to the message or plan to confront Royce. Instead, I called Kathy.

When Kathy heard about Joanna's husband and Maeve, she immediately started cursing. "Can you believe these men? What is it about Maeve that attracts all the guys in our circle?"

"At least Royce is young. He probably doesn't like women like Maeve!"

I hadn't even mentioned what Maeve told me, but Kathy's words distracted me.

If Royce didn't like Maeve, could he really like me?

Young girls like Yvonne, full of life, were probably more his type!

As we chatted, the doorbell rang.

I told Kathy to keep quiet about this for now and promised to explain everything in person later, then hung up.

When I opened the door, Royce stood there, dressed in a black casual outfit.

Different from the photo Yvonne sent.

But the faint scent of perfume on him made me feel sick!

I frowned at him. "What are you doing here?"

Royce looked taken aback by my tone. "Hey, I just wanted to see you. Is everything okay?"

I crossed my arms, trying to keep my cool. "I got a message from Yvonne. She sent me a picture of you two having dinner. Care to explain?"

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Caroline, it's not what you think. She just showed up at the restaurant. I didn't even know she was going to be there."

"Really? Because it sure looked like you were having a good time," I shot back, my voice dripping with sarcasm.

"Look, I can't control where she goes. But I promise you, I didn't invite her. I was just being polite," he insisted, stepping closer.

I took a step back, not ready to let him off the hook. "Polite? Royce, she called me an old woman and said I don't deserve you. And now you're telling me you just happened to run into her?"

He looked genuinely hurt. "Caroline, I had no idea she was going to do that. I swear. You're the one I care about."

I wanted to believe him, but the doubt lingered. "You need to prove it, Royce. Actions speak louder than words."

He nodded, determination in his eyes. "I will. Just give me a chance."

I sighed, feeling the weight of the day's events pressing down on me. "Fine. But don't think for a second that I'm going to let this slide easily."

Royce reached out, gently taking my hand. "I understand. I'll do whatever it takes to make this right."

As I looked into his eyes, I hoped he meant it. Because I couldn't handle another betrayal. Not after everything I'd been through.

###chapter 253

Royce stood at the doorway, yanking at his tie in frustration as he heard the impatience in my voice.

He took a couple of steps forward, and I caught a faint whiff of alcohol mixed with a subtle hint of perfume.

The same scent I had smelled that day.

It was probably from Yvonne.

The thought made me even more irritated. "I asked you, what are you doing here?"

Too many things were weighing on my mind, making my thoughts jumbled.

Looking at Royce standing in front of me, I couldn't muster a friendly expression.

Royce's pupils contracted, and a hint of hurt flashed in his eyes as he leaned in closer. "What's wrong?"

He didn't call my name, but his eyes were slightly unfocused as he approached.

I took a step back. "If there's nothing important, just go back."

"I don't have time to chat with you."

I still hadn't dealt with everything that happened today, and in a few days, I had to attend a baby shower. Before that, I had meetings at the office.

I had a lot on my plate, I thought.

Just as I was about to push Royce out and close the door, he raised his hand to hold the doorframe, stubbornly looking at me. "Talk to me properly."

His attitude only made me more annoyed.

I spoke coldly, "Let go."

"No. Tell me what's wrong first."

We were at a stalemate when I heard movement inside the house, as if someone was coming out.

I heard my mom's puzzled voice, "Caroline, what's going on? Who's here?"

The footsteps were getting closer.

I didn't want Kelly to see me arguing with Royce, so I stepped out of the house and closed the door behind me.

Maybe my sudden movement caught Royce off guard, and he didn't dodge in time, so I almost bumped into him.

I glared at him. "Follow me downstairs."

Royce seemed to understand what I was worried about and didn't insist like before. He followed me to the elevator.

I was fuming inside, and my steps were hurried as I entered the elevator.

When we reached the ground floor, Royce caught up to me and grabbed my wrist as I continued to walk away.

"Caroline."

The way he called my name reminded me of when he confessed his feelings to me.

His deep, rich voice was like red wine, but thinking about how he had been with someone else today, I lost interest immediately.

"We need to talk this out."

I shook off his hand, trying to put some distance between us.

Even though I knew that if I kept losing my temper, he might not be able to take it.

Royce seemed a bit helpless. "What do you mean, talk it out? Are you going to bring up the same things again, Caroline?"

"So you still want to talk about the same things? Caroline, I don't know what I did wrong to make you suddenly treat me like this."

I thought about the text Yvonne sent me, the things Maeve told me, and Kathy's comment that "Royce probably doesn't like that type."

The emotions welled up inside me, making my voice bitter. "What do you want me to say? You didn't do anything wrong, but you have so many options."

"Options?"

"Like Yvonne, and plenty of other young girls who are interested in you."

As soon as I said that, Royce moved.

He grabbed my shoulders and said seriously, "Caroline, look at me."

"I thought the last time we talked about this would be the final time. I thought my sincerity had moved you, and you would give me a chance to pursue you. But I didn't expect you to go back on your word."

His words stung, and I instinctively wanted to break free and argue back.

But then he said, "Caroline, you're not like this when you're doing business. Why are you such a coward when it comes to me?"

"Where's the fearless you who dared to love and hate? I'm just asking for a chance to pursue you, not even for you to agree to be with me. Why can't you even give me that?"

Why?

My emotions burst, and I suddenly broke down. "Because even if we were together, people would think I used some trick!"

"Royce, I've been hurt by marriage and love. Now I have a few kids to take care of, but you have plenty of young girls around you. Can you guarantee you'll never change your mind?"

Royce's silence grew more pronounced as I spoke.

I didn't know if he was wavering.

But I knew that as I said these things, I felt a sense of release.

"In any case, I've thought it through. We're not right for each other. Don't come looking for me again."

His hands slipped from my shoulders.

I gritted my teeth and walked away from him. "And no matter what business we might have in the future, don't come to my house."

My mom had a good impression of him and had even told me not to give up too easily.

But when it came to feelings, I was truly scared.

Back home, Kelly was in the living room, looking at me. "Did you go out just now? I heard some noise at the door."

"Yeah, I had something to take care of."

I didn't say much more.

My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I took it out to check.

It was a message from Royce.

[No matter what you said today, I'm going to pretend it didn't happen. Starting tomorrow, I'll continue to pursue you seriously.]

[Caroline, I'm serious about you. If you don't like other girls around me, I can replace all my assistants.]

Is that the issue?

I almost wanted to throw my phone.

This feeling of having made a decision but not being able to cut ties was frustrating.

I put down my phone and went to check on the kids.

Since bringing the kids back, we had converted a large master bedroom into a children's room.

When I entered the room, I saw the kids sleeping soundly in their beds.

During the time I was busy outside, Kelly had taken on the responsibility of caring for the kids, doing her best to take care of each one.

I was grateful for that, and after some thought, I transferred some money to Kelly.

Not long after I left the children's room, Kelly was waiting at the door, scolding me playfully. "Why did you suddenly transfer money to me?"

"I don't want it. I'll send it back to you. You have plenty of expenses with your business."

I hugged her with a smile. "Mom, I have plenty of money. You've been taking care of the kids' every need. I promised to take care of you, so why are you spending your own money?"

"You silly child, I'm not that old yet. And let me tell you, among my peers, none of them are as happy as I am. Not only am I a grandmother, but several times over."

Her words made my eyes well up with tears.

###chapter 254

I held Kelly's hand tightly.

"I thought my failed marriage would make you ashamed of me."

Thinking back to the divorce, the hardest part was how it affected my parents.

Anyone with eyes could see I had chosen the wrong person, but there were plenty of jealous neighbors spreading rumors that my strong personality had driven Brandon to cheat.

The first time I came home after the divorce, Kelly hugged me and cried her heart out. I knew she had been holding it in too.

Kelly ruffled my hair and said, "Caroline, you've always been my pride and joy. There's nothing for me to be ashamed of."

"A failed marriage is just a bump in the road. I've come to terms with it. Sure, some people have gossiped about your marriage, but I just cut ties with them."

"Don't judge others without knowing their struggles."

Kelly understood this better than I did.

I silently shed tears and hugged Kelly, acting spoiled. "Mom, I'll let you take care of my kids in the future. You'll be the best grandma."

"How old are you, still acting like a child?" Kelly pulled me to sit on the couch with her.

"Speaking of which, Caroline, I know your last marriage hurt you, but have you thought about remarrying?"

Hearing Kelly bring this up, I knew she must have seen Royce come over earlier.

I shook my head. "Mom, I really don't want to think about that right now."

"Caroline, I think Royce is a good guy. So what if he's younger? As long as he treats you well, that's what matters. We thought Brandon was a good match because he was your age, but look how that turned out."

Kelly's words were sincere, and I understood them.

But the messages from Yvonne were something I couldn't ignore.

"Mom, he's different from me. We can be friends, but I'm not suited for marriage with him."

I decided to share my thoughts with Kelly. After all, she's family, and if she understood, it would be easier to handle Royce in the future.

"First, I already have kids and don't plan to have more. Royce is still young. He might say he doesn't want kids now, but what if he changes his mind in a few years? Even if I wanted to, I'd be a high-risk pregnancy and might not be able to have more."

Kelly looked a bit taken aback. "Caroline, I didn't realize you had thought about all this."

I knew she was listening.

These were real issues, and no one could ignore them.

"That's one thing. Another is that I'll age faster than him. In today's society, men are still valued more as they age. How could I compete with younger women? Brandon is a perfect example."

I said a lot, and Kelly listened intently.

She patted my hand and pinched my cheek from time to time.

Finally, I whispered, "And Mom, I don't even know if I still have the right to pursue happiness."

"Especially after seeing so many husbands cheat."

Kelly was silent for a moment, then patted my back. "Caroline, you've grown up."

No more words were needed. I knew she chose to respect my decision.

That night, I slept well.

But in my dreams, someone was always chasing me.

He held a bouquet of roses but kept his distance.

In the dream, I felt calm. When I woke up, I saw a new message on my phone.

"I bought you flowers."

It was from Royce.

Thinking about my dream, I smiled bitterly and didn't reply.

Later that morning, I met Kathy at a coffee shop.

"Caroline, over here."

She waved at me.

I ordered a sugar-free coffee and asked, "Weren't we supposed to meet at the hospital today? Why here?"

Kathy waved her hand dismissively. "A client stood me up."

"Such bad luck. This client already stood me up once before, apologized profusely, and I didn't think much of it. She contacted me again yesterday, and I agreed."

"But today, she canceled again and asked for a refund. If she weren't a struggling student, I wouldn't give her the money back."

Hearing this, I asked instinctively, "A student? From a nearby school?"

"Probably. I can't see her personal info; she contacted me through WhatsApp."

I hadn't planned to think much of it, but something clicked, and I remembered the messages I received.

I grabbed Kathy's hand. "I remember you can see the name when transferring money on WhatsApp. Try it."

Kathy frowned, not understanding my insistence. "What's going on?"

"Just check. Or search by phone number."

I handed her the number I saved yesterday. "Just try it."

I suspected Yvonne was retaliating for what happened that day.

After all, I hadn't said anything directly; it was Kathy and the others who confronted her.

Seeing those messages, I knew Yvonne held grudges and might target Kathy.

Kathy tried it and found the client on WhatsApp.

Her eyes widened. "It's really her."

"Who is she?"

I smiled bitterly. "Remember Royce's classmate, Yvonne?"

Kathy finally recalled. "Oh, right..."

She reacted quickly, slamming the table.

People around us looked over, surprised. I quickly said, "Calm down."

"Is Yvonne crazy?"

Kathy had a shorter fuse than I did and was ready to curse her out on WhatsApp.

I stopped her. "Don't talk to her."

For some reason, competing with Yvonne made me feel ashamed.

It felt like fighting with a young girl over a man, and I didn't like it.

I had promised myself never to be insecure over a man again.

Kathy blinked. "Fine, I'll let it go for now. But I'll come up with a way to embarrass her. Don't stop me then."

I sighed. "Do what you want. I just don't want to compete with anyone."

I showed her the messages I received.

Kathy was even angrier, gritting her teeth. "I thought Royce was good to you, but if Yvonne is sending these messages, he must have given her some signal."

"He's not worth it."

Hearing this, I instinctively wanted to defend Royce.

I knew how easy it was for Yvonne to create misunderstandings.

###chapter 255

They were alumni, and I knew the school was planning a reunion soon.

Maybe it was because everyone they knew was getting together, or maybe it was something else, but Yvonne always found a way to get under my skin.

But I didn't want to dig into it.

"I'm not a little girl anymore; I'm tired of these games. If he can't keep his life together, I don't want him."

Kathy took a sip of her coffee and stayed quiet.

I pulled out my tablet to handle some work with Asher, and when it was about time, I dragged Kathy to the maternity center.

Compared to the last time we met, Isadora looked much healthier. It was clear the maternity center was taking good care of her.

The baby was in a crib nearby, and when Kathy and I leaned over to play with him, he smiled at us.

"He's so cute. Makes me want to get married and have kids," Kathy said without thinking.

Isadora was sipping the bubble tea we had secretly brought her, hiding it from Marshall. She laughed and said, "Then hurry up and get married. Out of all of us, you're the only one who hasn't gone through this yet."

"No way. Men can't be trusted. Even Joanna's husband..."

Kathy was staring at the baby and blurted it out.

By the time I realized something was wrong, it was too late.

Isadora, holding her bubble tea, looked shocked. "What are you talking about?"

Kathy turned around, rubbed her nose, and glanced at me. "Sorry, I forgot for a moment..."

I looked at Isadora and sighed. "Isadora, it's not that we didn't want to tell you. It's just that you're recovering, and I didn't want gossip to upset you."

But Isadora was curious. "Tell me now. Did Joanna's husband cheat?"

"Yes, Caroline saw him with another woman at a hotel yesterday."

"Who was the woman? Do I know her?" Isadora seemed intrigued.

I hesitated. "Maeve, do you know her?"

Isadora slapped her thigh. "Maeve! Everyone knows her. Isn't she the infamous mistress in our circle?"

"But Joanna's husband too? I met him before and he didn't seem like that kind of guy."

Kathy sighed. "Who knows? That's why Caroline and I have given up on love. We don't believe in it anymore."

Realizing this wasn't the best thing to say to Isadora, Kathy quickly added, "Of course, your love with Marshall still gives me a bit of hope."

Isadora waved her hand. "Don't worry about my feelings. Love and marriage are things you only understand after experiencing them yourself."

"When I had my baby, there were a lot of issues at home too. But my husband was good to me, so we got through it."

We chatted about these issues for a while, still unsure whether to tell Joanna.

After all, we weren't that close to her, and telling her might backfire.

But as women, we didn't want her to be kept in the dark.

Leaving the maternity center, Kathy linked her arm with mine. "Let's go pick out a gift for the baby."

"I haven't decided what to get yet. Do you think a onesie is too common?" I was a bit conflicted.

Kathy laughed. "You can't go wrong with a onesie. Just get one."

Coincidentally, as soon as we entered the mall, we saw Yvonne.

Yvonne was shopping with another girl.

Both of them had a student vibe, dressed simply but trying hard to look stylish.

The other girl wore a simple dress and flats, looking slim.

Yvonne, on the other hand, wore a blouse and a pencil skirt with high heels.

She looked completely different from the last time we saw her.

But this mature outfit didn't suit her; she looked like a kid playing dress-up.

Kathy recognized her first and nudged my elbow. "Isn't that Yvonne?"

I glanced over. "Let's just go to the baby store."

But as we tried to leave, Yvonne spotted us.

Her eyes lit up, and she walked straight toward us.

The girl in flats continued shopping, seemingly unaware that Yvonne had left.

"What a coincidence, you two are shopping too?" Yvonne's tone was sarcastic.

Kathy felt uncomfortable but remembered her promise to make Yvonne feel embarrassed. She didn't mention the texts or the appointment and just laughed. "Judging by your outfit, you look more like the older sister."

It was true. Kathy and I were dressed casually, looking young and lively.

Yvonne's face darkened, a flash of malice in her eyes. "Shopping here? This area is for young girls. It doesn't seem suitable for you."

"And it's suitable for you?" Kathy shot back.

Throwing the question back at her left Yvonne speechless.

Yvonne's face turned ugly. She lifted her bag and said, "It's okay. My taste isn't really these brands, but someone gave me a gift card for this store, so I'm here to pick up a bag."

I glanced at the bag she was holding, a new release from a budget brand.

I suddenly realized this wasn't something Royce would do.

He had given me gifts before, and he never skimped.

Royce wasn't short on money and was generous. He wouldn't bother with small gestures to please a woman.

I didn't say anything, just pulled Kathy to leave.

But Yvonne called out behind me, "Ms. Sharp, who's paying for your shopping today?"

I stopped in my tracks.

The girl continued, "At your age, you probably don't know what it's like to be pampered."

Yvonne must have looked into my background, maybe even knew about Brandon.

The funny thing was, Brandon never gave me any gifts.

But hearing this, I didn't feel sad. I just replied, "Yvonne, at my age, it doesn't matter if I'm pampered or not. Being broke is the real tragedy."

I glanced at her bag and smiled.

"You know, the money I spend on accessories could buy a hundred of those bags."

With that, I pulled Kathy away.

Kathy gave me a thumbs up. "Well said. That's how you handle it."

In the end, I picked out a cute outfit for Isadora's baby.

It might be common, but it was a symbol of love and care.

After choosing the gift, I headed back to the office.

Asher was waiting for me in the conference room. When he saw me, he stood up and smiled. "Caroline."

"Why the sudden meeting? There's no rush after winning the bid."

I was still a bit tired from rushing back and plopped down in a chair.

Asher smiled and pulled out a contract. "This is my first project since I got back. I need to prepare!"

###chapter 256

"That part isn't urgent, but I put together a proposal for you to check out. If you think it's good, I'll go ahead with it."

Asher's sincerity really got to me. "Asher, you won the bid because you're talented. No need to stress so much."

"I can't help it. I'm just worried that if I mess up, it'll make you look bad."

We both went quiet. Even though the incident was resolved, we knew people would still talk behind our backs.

I used to think that if you were honest, rumors couldn't hurt you. But after my divorce, I realized how damaging gossip could be.

Thinking about this, I quickly said, "Asher, just keep a cool head and stick to the plan. It'll all work out."

"Caroline, your faith in me means a lot."

Asher's eyes were actually red.

I knew how hard he had worked over the years. Winning the bid must have brought a lot of pressure.

I glanced at the proposal. It looked fine, but something came to mind.

"Did you pay the performance bond like you're supposed to?"

Asher chuckled, "Yeah, I did. The day after we won the bid, I had the finance team pay it right away to avoid any mistakes. The service fee was paid too. I wouldn't forget something like that."

I sighed in relief. "There was a small company that won a bid for the first time and didn't know the process, so they didn't pay the fee and ended up breaching the contract."

"But speaking of that, I paid the fee, but I haven't received the award notification or the contract yet."

Asher suddenly remembered.

I frowned. "They haven't given it to you? I'll follow up."

To avoid suspicion, I hadn't been involved much with the project these past few days.

I didn't realize they were still holding up the process.

It seemed Asher came today not just to show me the proposal but also to ask about this.

"Asher, don't worry. With me here, there's no way you'll miss out on the award notification."

With my assurance, Asher felt relieved.

After Asher left, I went to the project department to inquire.

I found out that Clementine Bennett, who had been handling the bidding, was on vacation. She was one of the company's earliest employees.

Coincidentally, her vacation seemed to have delayed this matter.

"Her position is so important. How could she go on vacation without a handover?" I still felt something was off. "Give me all the specific contracts. I'll take a look. The notification and contract need to be signed quickly, or we'll be in breach."

Even though we had a month, four or five days had already passed.

There weren't many working days, and who knew what other changes could happen if we delayed?

The assistant nodded. "I'll urge the project department to handle it by tomorrow."

On my way back, I still felt uneasy.

I hadn't interacted much with Clementine before. Although she had been with the company for a long time, she was always an ordinary employee, not in the project department.

Later, when I was home sick, I heard she got promoted under Brandon's management, eventually becoming the project manager.

I had my doubts about this, but after secretly observing, I found Clementine's work ability was indeed good, so I didn't say anything more.

In my impression, this was the first time she hadn't completed her work.

A cold wind blew, and I heard footsteps behind me.

I hadn't planned on taking a cab today, so I was walking along the main road outside the company. Was someone following me?

I walked a few more steps casually, crossed the street, and took a quick glance.

Sure enough, a guy in a baseball cap was tailing me.

But he must've sensed I was onto him because he suddenly stopped following and ran straight toward me.

I was about to call out to a passerby when the man said, "Caroline, don't be scared."

Don't be scared? Yeah, right!

I took two steps back, ready to call for help.

The guy had a hat and mask on, so I could only see his eyes, and his hair almost covered his forehead.

"Who are you?"

He hesitated before saying, "Who I am doesn't matter. I just want to warn you that Clementine and Alfonso from your company are in a relationship. Be careful."

After saying this, he glanced at me, looked around, and took off.

I stood there, stunned.

Clementine and Alfonso? Could it really be such a coincidence?

Although I had felt something was off today, when had my intuition ever been this accurate...

But rather than trusting Clementine, I preferred to investigate.

This guy wouldn't warn me for no reason.

Thinking of this, I quickly called another assistant, "Remy, there's a change in plans. Can you catch the next flight back?"

Remy was an assistant I had secretly trained after my divorce.

She was studying abroad and helped me handle international business in her spare time.

I hadn't asked her to come back before because I didn't want to draw too much attention. Most of the company's employees were trained by me, and after my divorce from Brandon, they chose to side with me.

But now...

I needed to keep a closer eye on the company.

After talking to Remy, I still felt uneasy and sent her a message to investigate secretly.

I also contacted Simon.

Actually, my first thought was to contact Royce.

But our relationship was awkward now. When I opened his WhatsApp, I saw he had sent me many messages.

I had decided to cut ties with him, so I hadn't replied to any of them.

If I bothered him now for my own issues, it would seem like I was using him as a tool.

Sighing, I exited Royce's chat and thought of someone else.

I took out the note Maeve had given me and added the number.

Maeve quickly accepted the request and asked if I was Caroline.

I replied, "Yes."

[I've been wondering when you'd reach out. Have you made up your mind?]

Made up my mind about what?

I remembered Maeve had mentioned something about Brandon.

But I felt Maeve was more than she seemed. She had many improper relationships with men, but when she spoke to me that day, I realized she was a powerful network herself.

Maybe it was because she had so much evidence and leverage that she could navigate the social circles without failing?

I wanted to ask her about Alfonso, how much she knew.

But as I typed the message, I deleted it word by word.

[Not yet, just thought we might be in touch in the future.]

Maeve quickly replied.

[It's only a matter of time. You're always welcome.]

Even though she was someone despised in mainstream circles, at that moment, I found her mysterious and intriguing.

I shook my head, clearing my chaotic thoughts, and opened her Facebook.

The first thing I saw was Maeve's post from today.

She had gone to a hot spring, wearing very little. Her figure was exceptionally well-maintained for her age.

###chapter 257

Maeve's Facebook was like a perfectly curated gallery, almost as if she was some high-society socialite. Every post was about fancy dinners, exotic travels, and her late-night thoughts on books.

Maybe that was her whole vibe?

Some people totally bought into it.

To those guys, she was probably the definition of charm and allure.

No wonder she caught Brandon's eye back then.

But thinking about it, another question hit me.

How did Maeve even get into this circle in the first place?

Everyone knew about her antics, yet she still managed to show up at all these events. Besides her own cunning, she must have had some help.

Suddenly, a thought struck me like a bolt of lightning.

How could I have forgotten this?!

Without wasting any time, I called Simon.

"Simon, do you remember how Brandon first met Maeve?"

Simon sounded puzzled on the other end. "Caroline, why are you suddenly asking about Maeve?"

"Did you find some new lead? Is Brandon up to no good again?"

I chuckled bitterly. "Brandon's still locked up at the police station. Breaking and entering, plus theft, should keep him there for a good ten days or so."

Brandon had fallen so far that no one was willing to help him.

Maeve had told me that Brandon even tried to contact her through someone at the police station, asking her to bail him out.

The thought of it made me laugh.

But I didn't share this with Simon. Instead, I asked, "I thought of Maeve because of something else..."

"So, who introduced her to Brandon in the first place?"

I really couldn't remember.

Maybe it was because I was too busy gathering evidence for my divorce from Brandon at the time.

My friends knew and were helping me.

I thought life would be better after the divorce, but so much happened since then that my mind felt sluggish.

Especially after Royce returned. He helped me so much that I became overly reliant on him.

Cutting off contact with him these past few days, I forced myself to handle things on my own.

Simon hesitated for a moment before saying, "Caroline, this isn't something I can explain over the phone. How about we meet up?"

Hearing his reluctance, I knew there was more to the story.

"Come over to my new place. I'll be waiting."

After hanging up, I took a deep breath and sat on the couch.

Before I could gather my thoughts, my phone buzzed again.

I thought it was Simon calling back, but it was Royce.

I stared at his name on the screen, not moving.

The screen dimmed, showing a missed call.

Then it lit up again.

It seemed like he would keep calling until I answered.

Feeling a bit helpless, I hung up.

This time, Royce didn't call back, but WhatsApp notifications started popping up.

[Why aren't you answering my calls?]

[Did you see the flowers I sent? They're beautiful. I want to send you a bouquet every day.]

[Caroline, at least say something. I'm really worried about you.]

Reading his messages, I felt torn.

Part of me wanted to reply.

People have feelings. Even though I'm a divorced woman, it's hard to ignore a man's passionate pursuit.

Especially since we had spent so much time together.

On the other hand, I wanted to ask Royce about Joanna...

To see if he knew anything.

But after much thought, I suppressed my emotions.

Since I had already made things clear, I shouldn't bother him.

If he couldn't reach me, his enthusiasm would probably fade soon.

That's what I told myself.

But that night, seeing his persistent goodnight messages made my heart ache.

If only that woman named Yvonne hadn't shown up at the party!

Eventually, I drifted off to sleep without realizing it.

The next morning, I quickly got ready and headed out.

My new place was in Sunny Meadows, about a half-hour drive from Kelly's.

Sunny Meadows was near the outskirts, at the foot of a mountain, with beautiful scenery.

Every time I came here, I felt inexplicably relaxed, especially after entering the neighborhood. It felt like I was retreating into the mountains.

But today, my mood was heavy.

Simon was already waiting at the door. Seeing me, he quickly greeted me.

"Caroline."

Surprised, I walked over and opened the door for him. "Why didn't you just come in?"

I didn't come here often and had given him a key.

Simon shook his head. "It's your place. Even though we agreed to meet, it didn't feel right to wait inside like I owned the place."

I sighed with a smile. "We've known each other for so long. No need to be so formal."

We went inside and sat on the couch. I poured Simon a glass of water.

As soon as I sat down, Simon spoke up. "Caroline, about what you asked me yesterday..."

I looked up at him. "Is there something you can't say? Why couldn't you tell me over the phone?"

Simon quickly explained, "Caroline, with everything that's happened recently, I was worried about potential dangers. If our call was being monitored, it could be bad."

I gaped at him. "You're overthinking it."

"Sure, someone might be watching me, but monitoring my calls... that's a bit much!"

If someone was capable of that, there wasn't much I could do to stop them.

Simon smiled wryly. "I don't know why, but I've been worried about a lot lately... Anyway, back to what you asked."

I nodded, ready to listen, when the doorbell rang.

Who could it be at this hour?

And did anyone else know we were meeting here today?

I looked at Simon, puzzled. He got up to answer the door.

To my surprise, he returned with Royce.

I watched in shock as they both walked over and sat down.

Royce acted like nothing was amiss, telling Simon, "Traffic was bad. Otherwise, I would've been here sooner."

I stared at Royce, my mind racing. "What are you doing here?"

Royce looked at me, his expression serious. "I heard you were meeting Simon and thought I should be here too."

Simon glanced between us, sensing the tension. "Caroline, I didn't know Royce was coming. He just showed up."

I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. "Alright, let's just get to the point. Simon, you were about to tell me something important."

Simon nodded, looking a bit uneasy. "Right. So, about Maeve and Brandon... It wasn't just a random meeting. Maeve was introduced to Brandon by someone in his circle. Someone who wanted to use her to get to him."

I frowned, trying to piece it together. "Who would do that?"

Simon hesitated, then said, "It was Joanna. She wanted to manipulate Brandon, and Maeve was her pawn."

My heart sank. Joanna had always been a shadowy figure in our lives, but this was a new low.

Royce leaned forward, his eyes intense. "Caroline, I had no idea about this. I swear."

I looked at him, searching for any sign of deceit. "Why should I believe you?"

Royce sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Because I care about you. And I want to help you get to the bottom of this."

I felt a mix of emotions-anger, confusion, and a glimmer of hope. "Fine. But if we're going to do this, we need to be honest with each other. No more secrets."

Royce nodded, his expression determined. "Agreed. Let's find out the truth together."

Simon looked relieved, but I could see the worry in his eyes. "Just be careful, Caroline. This is bigger than we thought."

I nodded, feeling the weight of the situation. "I will. And thank you, Simon. For everything."

As we sat there, a sense of resolve settled over me. It was time to uncover the truth and finally put the past to rest.

###chapter 258

Simon said to him, "Hey, it's cool. You're swamped every day. I'm just glad you could make it on such short notice."

For some reason, I felt a pang of guilt.

I kept my head down, staring at my hands, not daring to speak.

Simon didn't know about the falling out between Royce and me.

Or rather, the fact that I had unilaterally decided to distance myself from Royce. Only Kelly and Kathy knew about it so far.

I hadn't figured out how to explain it to others yet.

Now, Simon had specifically called Royce over. Could it be about us?

Thinking about it, I found it unlikely.

Given Royce's personality, he wouldn't casually talk about our issues with others...

There was only one possibility left.

Simon must have called Royce over to discuss something related to Maeve!

Sure enough, after a while, Simon looked at me and said, "Caroline, now that Royce is here, let's talk about what really happened back then."

"Go ahead," I said, feeling increasingly uneasy.

But I didn't want to show it in front of Royce, so I just sat there, staring at Simon.

Simon seemed a bit nervous too, speaking softly, "We didn't want to tell you the details before. Maybe we mentioned it once or twice, and you forgot..."

As he started to beat around the bush, I grew more anxious. "What is it that you couldn't say before? What's Maeve's background?"

Simon shook his head. "Maeve doesn't have much of a background. She went into hiding for a while because of some trending news."

"I heard she was traveling abroad for a while... I didn't hear she was back, so when you asked me about her yesterday, I was caught off guard."

I continued listening, feeling Royce's gaze occasionally fall on me.

Thinking about the calls and messages I didn't return yesterday, I felt a wave of anxiety.

I chose not to make eye contact with him.

After a while, Simon said, "Caroline, we're telling you this because we don't want you to have any misunderstandings..."

"Do you remember when you were divorcing Brandon, I took you to the hospital for several check-ups?"

I did remember. "Yes, you said it was to make sure I hadn't caught any diseases, right?"

Simon nodded. "Do you know why I was so worried about you catching something, even though you were about to divorce?"

"Let me remind you, Brandon had already been in contact with Maeve, and according to her, they had definitely slept together."

With Simon's reminder, I suddenly realized something and covered my mouth.

Seeing my expression, Simon said, "Caroline, you're smart. You must have guessed it. Maeve has that kind of disease..."

So when she and Brandon were in contact and slept together, he could have been infected.

After I divorced Brandon, Simon kept urging me to get checked. I was too busy to go, so he personally took me.

Thinking back, I felt a chill run down my spine...

"All my test results were normal... And even without this, Brandon and I hadn't slept together since he drugged me and I got sick."

This topic was quite ordinary, but with Royce present, it was hard to talk about.

Simon quickly said, "Let's not dwell on that. The important thing is your tests came back fine, and I was relieved."

"Whether Brandon caught something from Maeve, we don't care. We didn't tell you the details because you were already dealing with the divorce and taking care of the kids. We didn't want to worry you more."

I nodded. "You were considerate."

Thinking about it, if I had known I might have caught something, I would have gone crazy!

That could have been the last straw...

I felt a bit grateful. "You all really protected me back then."

"It was the right thing to do. And Maeve was found with Joanna's help."

"What?" I blurted out. "Joanna arranged it?"

Simon nodded.

He hadn't continued speaking, seeming thirsty, and drank half a glass of water.

Royce then said, "When you were busy with the divorce, everyone was worried you'd be tricked by Brandon again. Joanna suggested making Brandon irredeemable, so she found Maeve. But she only told you about Maeve's reputation in the circle."

As they spoke, I recalled all the overlooked details.

Joanna and the others often met behind my back, worrying about me.

Hearing this, I was stunned.

I had been so busy looking for my child that I hadn't contacted Joanna much.

But since I decided to divorce, Joanna had helped me a lot.

I thought our relationship had cooled, but hearing this, I felt overwhelmed!

Seeing Joanna's husband cheat, I hesitated to tell her...

I covered my face. "I feel like I'm not a good friend."

Simon blinked. "Caroline, why say that? And why did you suddenly bring up Maeve yesterday?"

I thought for a long time and decided to tell them everything I saw that day.

Including seeing Maeve with Joanna's husband at the hotel and Maeve coming to find me later...

I told them everything in detail.

After listening, Simon and Royce's expressions were colorful.

After a long time, Simon said, "This is troublesome... If Maeve and Joanna's husband Ronnie Ford are involved, then Ronnie... Could Joanna also be..."

I covered half my face. "I asked you yesterday just to see if there was any news about Maeve, but now I really don't know what to do."

If I didn't know about Maeve's disease, I'd be confident in Joanna.

Joanna is sharp. If Ronnie acted strange, she'd notice.

We could just remind her, and she'd divorce him quickly.

But now, with the disease involved...

If Joanna got infected, we'd be guilty!

Royce said, "There's more to this."

###chapter 259

Simon and I both stared at Royce, trying to figure out what he was getting at.

"If Maeve's really got something going on with Ronnie, and considering what she said to you that day, could Ronnie be in on the whole plan too?"

I looked at Royce, completely lost. "What plan?"

He gave me a serious look. "What other plan? The whole Brandon situation!"

Simon slapped his thigh. "Man, you always connect the dots! I knew I was missing something..."

"Ronnie's not just some random guy. With his position and Aria's recent promotion, how could he end up with someone like Maeve?"

"There's gotta be another link between them..."

Simon trailed off, and Royce and I both said at the same time, "Could it be a honey trap?"

I had to admit, based on Maeve's Facebook and what I saw that day, she could definitely be the 'honey' in a honey trap.

Any guy who didn't know her situation could easily fall for her looks.

Royce said, "Since we suspect this, we can't just go straight to Joanna."

"But Joanna's my friend. If there's a chance she could be in danger... I can't just keep quiet. I'm scared something might happen to her."

I was torn.

Royce spoke up, "We can't rush this."

"We need to figure out how long Maeve and Ronnie have been involved. If it's been a while, we should get Joanna to the hospital for a check-up first..."

Simon got anxious. "You were just saying how smart you are, and now you can't see the obvious? Joanna's a smart woman. When you got divorced, we took her to the hospital for a check-up. Joanna knows everything."

"If we suddenly ask her to get checked, won't that give everything away?"

Royce was silent for a moment, then turned to me.

"If that's the case, there's only one way."

I looked up. "What?"

In such an important matter, my feelings for Royce vanished.

I knew that to resolve this and move forward, I needed Royce.

Royce said seriously, "In the next few days, find a chance to meet Joanna and talk."

"Feel her out and see if she knows about Ronnie."

I shook my head. "She's very perceptive. If she hasn't divorced yet, she definitely doesn't know."

"Then test her feelings for Ronnie and see how she would react to any potential surprises. Her attitude is crucial; otherwise, we can't move forward."

Royce seemed a bit anxious, speaking a long paragraph to me.

I was overwhelmed but nodded.

"Got it. I'll arrange to meet her."

They were right; Joanna's attitude was the most important.

But right now, I was exhausted.

Simon left shortly after, reminding me to keep this secret and not tell anyone.

He said he'd help investigate further.

I nodded, closed the door, and heard footsteps.

I had been so focused on Joanna that I almost forgot Royce was still in my house.

I turned and asked, "Are you leaving too?"

Royce was walking towards me but stopped at my words.

A few steps away, he looked at me with a half-smile.

"Are you that eager to get rid of me?"

I was taken aback and felt a bit guilty.

I avoided his gaze and said softly, "If you don't want to leave, you can stay."

"What's the point of staying? You don't even reply to my messages. Will you talk to me if I'm here?"

I didn't expect him to bring up our issues so directly.

I had wanted to avoid this topic, but now I had to respond.

I rubbed my head. "I don't really want to discuss this right now..."

"But if you insist, I've already told you my stance."

As I spoke, Royce took two steps closer. "Caroline, when you told me that day, I thought you were just throwing a tantrum."

"I went back and deleted Yvonne's contact. Before I did, I asked her if she said anything to you."

I was surprised that Royce would go to such lengths for me.

I looked up and met his deep, gentle eyes.

"She said she didn't say anything. So what are you mad about?"

I almost laughed. "Even if she did say something, she wouldn't tell you."

After all, Royce was the object of Yvonne's admiration. What girl would reveal her little schemes?

Especially when it involved slandering and provoking a rival.

Royce frowned. "So she did say something? No wonder you were so mad... and still won't talk to me."

I opened my mouth, wanting to deny it.

I wanted to say our situation was complicated, not just about Yvonne.

But thinking back, if it weren't for Yvonne, our cold war wouldn't have happened.

I didn't know what to say.

He came over and took my hand.

His thumb rubbed the back of my hand, and seeing I didn't pull away, he seemed relieved.

"You know, I've always been afraid of making you unhappy. Since we met, I've wanted you to ignore our differences and protect you like a sister."

I couldn't help but say, "You have so many sisters who adore you, yet you look for an older sister like me outside."

Saying this made me feel a bit sad.

Admitting my age wasn't easy.

Especially with a rival in the picture.

Royce laughed. "So all this is because of jealousy?"

I stayed silent.

I didn't know what he was thinking, debating whether to tell him everything.

When Yvonne and I were provoked at the mall, I thought it was over.

But I didn't speak, and Royce kissed my hand.

My heart fluttered like a butterfly had landed on it.

"What are you thinking? Can you tell me?"

In such tenderness, it was hard not to fall.

Thinking about it, maybe we did have misunderstandings...

I seemed willing to give him another chance...

I cursed myself for being weak.

###chapter 260

Once that thought crossed my mind, it was tough to shake it off.

So I spoke up, "Yvonne's been talking a lot of crap to me. She sent me a bunch of texts that were way out of line."

Royce's expression shifted, "Did you delete them? Can I see?"

Even though it felt like tattling, I pulled out my phone and showed him.

As he looked at my phone screen, Royce's face went pale.

"She always acts so sweet and considerate around me. We barely talk, except for a few times about her thesis and work. I thought it was good for classmates to help each other out."

Royce sighed, "I never expected her to act like this towards you."

I shook my head and put my phone away, "I'm not blaming you for this. Everyone has their social circles, and she hid her feelings for you well."

"Maybe you're just used to people chasing after you and admiring you, so you didn't notice."

Royce frowned, "Is there anything else besides this? I feel like you wouldn't be this angry and so determined to break things off with me over just one thing."

After all, I hadn't even been responding to his messages...

So I told him about running into Yvonne at the mall that day.

But I added, "I know the bag and clothes she was carrying weren't from you."

"Honestly, the clothes and the bag were pretty cheap. Even if you were just giving a normal thank-you gift, it would be worth more than that."

Royce actually laughed at that.

"Should I be happy? You really know me well in this regard."

I shrugged, "Well, we've been together for a while now."

We definitely understood each other, but...

That understanding might not be deeper than with others.

I pulled my hand away from his and walked over to the couch, sitting down and holding my cup of water.

Royce followed and sat next to me, "If it's just these things, I can totally understand why you'd be angry and want to distance yourself from me."

"If I were in your shoes and a rival acted like that towards me, I'd wonder if you gave them some hope too..."

I just held my cup and stayed silent.

Royce explained for a long time before I finally spoke, "On top of that, I happened to catch Ronnie cheating that day. Honestly, it was the last straw."

"After my divorce, I already had trust issues with love. Yvonne made me anxious, and then I saw someone else cheating."

I gave a bitter smile, "Do you think someone like me can still believe in love?"

Royce quickly said, "Of course you can."

"I can give you the best kind of love... I'm really different from them."

Hearing that, I admit, my heart started racing again.

The truth is, I do have feelings for him.

Whether it's the dependence or the attraction over this time.

I've only been divorced, and I'm not that old. Deep down, because of my failed marriage, I still long for a good relationship.

I'm just not sure if I can step into another relationship right now!

But Royce grabbed my hand, making me look at him, "Give me another chance."

"I'll warn Yvonne and set things straight with her. I'll keep my distance from other women, and I won't do any favors for them."

I couldn't help but laugh, "Why do I feel like your wife already? Am I meddling in your social life?"

Royce looked serious, "It's not meddling; it's me choosing to be upfront with you."

I have to admit, he knows how to make me happy.

At least right now, my heart felt warm.

Maybe seeing my expression soften, Royce leaned in close, "So I'll take that as a yes."

"A yes to what?" I asked, playing along.

"A yes to giving me another chance, to let me properly pursue you. Let's pretend these past few days never happened."

Hearing that, I lowered my eyes again.

"The issues between us aren't that big... we can pretend they didn't happen. But what about Joanna?"

And with Clementine's situation, I hadn't figured out what to do.

There's business competition on one side and a friend's trouble on the other. I really can't handle it all.

Isn't it normal to want to rely on someone at a time like this?

I thought about it and asked him, "If I agree to give you another chance, can you promise never to make me sad again?"

Even though I knew it was a tough question.

Royce immediately pulled me into his arms, "I can promise. But I have one condition."

"Go ahead."

"If someone upsets you again, tell me right away, and I'll handle it. Don't distance yourself from me because of what others say; that's punishing me."

I couldn't help but laugh, "That's your only request?"

"Yes... let's not talk about more for now. Let me win you over first."

I let Royce hold me, feeling a sudden warmth in my heart.

I knew he genuinely liked me.

Otherwise, he wouldn't act like this.

After two days of tension with Royce, I didn't expect it to be resolved so simply.

I had Simon to thank for that.

But thinking about meeting today, I originally wanted to resolve the issue with Joanna, and my mood became heavy again.

In the afternoon, I went to the office to handle work, and after returning home, I called Joanna.

"Hey, Joanna?"

Joanna sounded surprised, "Caroline, you reached out to me? I thought the next time we'd meet would be at Isadora's baby's one-month celebration."

"Come on, can't I miss you?" I joked with her.

To gauge her attitude towards Ronnie, I needed to get closer to her.

Otherwise, with our lukewarm relationship lately, who would want to share their deepest thoughts with me?

Sure enough, my joke made Joanna happy, "You still remember to miss me. You've been so busy running around lately, I couldn't catch you for a meal."

"Well, I'm free now. How about dinner tomorrow?"

Joanna was surprised by my sudden invitation but quickly agreed, "Of course, I'm free tomorrow."

"Then it's settled. Come over to my place, and I'll cook for you."

"Really, Caroline? It's been so long since I had your cooking."

I laughed, "Why do you make it sound like such a rare thing..."

"It is," Joanna said with a smile in her voice, "By the way, is Kathy coming?"

###chapter 261

"I haven't had dinner with her in forever. How about we invite her, and the two of us can help you out?"

Seeing that Joanna already had plans, I didn't want to ruin her mood. I said, "I was hoping for a quiet dinner with just you, but if you want to see her, I'll reach out."

"If she's free, how about the three of us have dinner tomorrow?"

Joanna happily agreed.

After hanging up, I still felt a bit incredulous.

Everything had gone too smoothly.

But it also left a slight bitterness in my heart.

Joanna was clearly thrilled to hear from me.

It showed that she still cared about me as a friend...

And here I was, planning to meet her with ulterior motives.

Thinking about it made me feel awful. That evening, I called Kathy to talk about it, and I couldn't help but share my thoughts.

"Kathy, I've been thinking about something all day. I feel like I've let you all down as friends."

I sighed heavily.

For some reason, I was feeling particularly down today.

Even though I had seen Simon and Royce earlier, and even made temporary peace with Royce, it hadn't lifted my spirits.

Instead, I felt even more melancholic...

Kathy was surprised after hearing me out. "What's going on? You seemed fine when we talked about meeting up tomorrow."

"Honestly, I haven't had your cooking in a long time. I miss it too."

Her words made me laugh. "I'm trying to talk about something serious, and you're just distracting me."

Hearing the smile in my voice, Kathy felt reassured. "Caroline, I just noticed you sounded off."

We had just made plans to meet tomorrow, and now my mood had suddenly plummeted.

Even I found it strange when I thought about it.

"I can't help it. My mood has been all over the place lately. I don't even know what's wrong with me."

The last time I felt like this was when I was preparing for my divorce.

Even when I realized I had been drugged, I wasn't this down.

Back then, I was solely focused on escaping their clutches, with no room for other thoughts.

Kathy, hearing my constant sighs, started to feel affected too. "Caroline, you're making me feel sad too. But if we're talking about letting friends down, I feel the same way."

"You know, when you first told me you suspected Brandon had drugged you and everything at home felt off, I was shocked, disbelieving, and heartbroken..."

Kathy told me how she had tried to help and stayed in touch, but once she had time to process it, she felt terrified.

She even felt guilty.

Kathy recalled, "You know, I had several nightmares back then, dreaming that Brandon had killed you. I woke up crying, sobbing uncontrollably..."

"I thought if something happened to you, it would be because I neglected you. You hadn't contacted me for so long, and when I tried to visit, Brandon blocked me. I never thought to investigate further!"

Kathy's words brought me back to that painful time.

But unlike her nightmares, my life back then was a real nightmare every day...

Thinking about it, I laughed and cried. "Why didn't you tell me then?"

"How could I? Telling you I dreamt you died would have been so ominous. Thankfully, you managed to escape on your own. Looking back, I'm so relieved."

We talked for a long time, and Kathy reminded me that the past couldn't be changed.

But none of us are islands; we all need friends.

Maybe resolving things with Joanna would give me more space to think and opportunities.

"Don't overthink it. Let's support each other and be good to one another. We've been friends for so many years; we know each other well."

Kathy comforted me a bit more before hanging up.

I took a deep breath, sat for a while, and then went to check on the kids in the next room.

Since finding my child, I've felt much more at peace.

Unlike before, when I was constantly worried about the child and couldn't settle my mind.

Brett was reading a storybook, and when he saw me, he ran over on his little legs.

"Mommy."

Seeing Brett's smiling face, I felt a wave of calm.

Maybe it was because I had talked so much about the past with Kathy, but now I realized that if it weren't for Brett, I might not have escaped so smoothly...

I couldn't help but hug Brett. "Good boy."

"Why is Mommy suddenly praising me? It's late, and Mommy isn't going to bed."

Brett has always been the most understanding child.

He urged me to sleep, but his little hands hugged me tightly.

He wasn't big enough yet, so his hug was a bit clumsy, almost clinging to me.

"Nothing, I just feel like I've been busy with work lately and haven't spent much time with you all..."

"How about we go for a picnic in a few days?"

Brett's eyes lit up with excitement. "All of us?"

"Yes, and we'll bring Grandma and Kathy too. How does that sound?"

Brett nodded enthusiastically. "That sounds great! It's been so long since we went out to play with everyone."

His innocent words made my heart ache.

Thinking about it, we hadn't had a proper celebration since finding the child.

Only my family and close friends knew about it.

We hadn't even gone out to play.

Even though the kids were still young, I already felt guilty.

"Alright, I'll plan it in a few days. We'll go for a picnic or maybe have a party at a hotel."

Thinking about it, I realized I didn't even know the exact date of the child's birth.

When the child was switched, a lot of information got mixed up.

After finding the child, I was busy with the bidding process and dealing with Alfonso's challenges, almost forgetting about the paperwork.

I needed to ask Simon about these things in the next few days.

After putting Brett to sleep, I returned to my room, and Royce's call came through.

"Caroline."

He called my name, his tone formal, unlike before.

I instinctively felt puzzled. "Why suddenly..."

Halfway through, I wondered if I was being too strange. We hadn't fully reconciled, so what right did I have to question his change in tone?

But Royce, being perceptive, immediately asked, "Do you want me to call you Caroline like before?"

I stayed silent.

But I knew, as smart as he was, he would understand what I meant.

###chapter 262

Sure enough, it didn't take long for Royce to laugh. "Caroline, I thought you were all ice-cold. Now that I know you care about me too, I'm really happy."

"I don't, stop making stuff up." I felt a bit shy and denied it awkwardly.

Royce completely ignored my denial. "If I say you do, then you do. If I say it's you, then it's you."

"Then why'd you even ask me?"

Sitting at my vanity, I glanced at myself in the mirror.

Just one look and I was stunned.

Was this blushing, love-struck person really me?

I had been thinking earlier today that I was a divorced woman with four kids.

And yet, just talking to Royce on the phone had me acting all bashful...

"From now on, can you reply to my messages and answer my calls?"

"Aren't I answering now?"

I felt a bit helpless.

But deep down, there was a sweet feeling.

"Royce."

"Yeah?"

He responded immediately when I called his name.

"Actually, I wasn't just being difficult with you. I really intended to end things."

"I know. But I didn't want to."

He understood my feelings completely.

I took a deep breath. "So you understand all my concerns, right?"

"I do... I've already cut ties with Yvonne. If you don't believe me, you can check my phone anytime."

"Also, Yvonne had applied for an internship at my company, and I rejected her."

Hearing this, I suddenly felt a bit guilty.

"That wasn't necessary..."

"For you, it was."

Royce's determination and seriousness about this matter moved me.

I knew he had really listened to me and was genuinely considering my feelings.

"Alright then. Since you've already turned her away, it wouldn't be right to let her intern now anyway."

Royce laughed. "That's favoritism."

Hearing him say it so bluntly made me even more embarrassed.

But then I thought, sometimes doing things that might seem like personal vendettas to others for the sake of someone you love isn't so bad.

After all, it was Yvonne who started this.

Thinking this, I felt much more at ease. "We'll see how you do from now on."

"By saying that, you're agreeing to let me keep pursuing you, right?"

"You figure it out."

I was about to hang up, but then I remembered my plans with Brett. "By the way..."

"In a few days, I'm planning to take the kids on a picnic or maybe rent out a hotel to chat with friends. Do you want to come?"

Royce sounded a bit excited at my invitation. "Can I really join?"

"Of course."

"Have you thought about what my role will be? Future stepdad?"

Hearing this, my face, which had just cooled down, heated up again...

"That's too far ahead. You're not even official yet."

With that, I hung up the phone.

My heart was still racing, all because of Royce.

Sometimes I wondered if love was a burden for me. After all, I'd been through so much and didn't want to get hurt again.

But Royce's sincerity made me hesitate.

I could feel something special in my heart.

I wondered if he might be different from Brandon.

Thinking this, I smiled.

That night, I slept well. But the next morning, when the doorbell rang and I saw Royce standing there, I was wide-eyed.

"What are you doing here?"

"I know you're meeting Joanna today, so I came to pick you up."

Royce looked around the house. "Where's Mrs. Sharp? I brought her a gift."

I suddenly felt flustered.

I hadn't told my mom about making up with Royce yet...

Kelly probably still remembered me crying to her that night, saying I didn't know if I had the right to pursue happiness.

Feeling embarrassed, I said, "My mom's probably still asleep..."

But just as I finished speaking, I heard a voice behind me. "We have a guest this early?"

Kelly walked over and saw Royce at the door. She looked at me with wide eyes. "Didn't you say you two..."

I felt very awkward. "He's here to pick me up. I have to go out for a bit..."

"I'll explain everything when I get back, Mom. Please watch the kids for me today."

Maybe because I was flustered, I spoke quickly, but Kelly seemed to understand my emotions. "Alright, alright, you go."

I knew in Kelly's eyes, I must have looked like a lovestruck teenager...

The kind who gets over things as soon as her boyfriend sweet-talks her...

But that was pretty much the situation now.

After getting ready, I left with Royce.

Once in his car, I realized he hadn't brought a driver and had come to pick me up himself.

"Ms. Sharp, today I'm your personal driver."

Royce even joked.

I couldn't help but laugh. "Since you're so free, let's go pick up Kathy."

"You're meeting Joanna, and Kathy's coming too?"

I nodded. "When I talked to Joanna yesterday, she said she hadn't had a meal with Kathy in a while, so we decided to meet up..."

"And Kathy's free today."

Thinking of Kathy, I remembered something. "By the way, Yvonne actually pissed Kathy off too."

Royce kept his eyes on the road, his expression unchanged. "What happened?"

I told him about Yvonne's stunt with the appointment.

"But I'm not telling you this to tattle, just so you know why Kathy might be in a bad mood when she sees you."

Royce said he understood.

On the way to pick up Kathy, I felt a bit nervous. After all, I had just told her about these things yesterday, and now Royce and I had made up. Kathy would probably be surprised...

Sure enough, when Kathy got in the car, she looked at me and then at Royce, her face full of curiosity.

I felt a bit helpless and said to her, "I'll explain everything later."

"Alright..." Kathy dragged out the word. "If you don't tell me everything, I'll make a fuss."

Royce stayed silent the whole way, just listening to Kathy and me chat in the car.

###chapter 263

We mostly talked about Ronnie.

Ronnie's been quite the rising star these past few years.

Climbing the ranks in his field wasn't easy, but Ronnie seemed to navigate that world effortlessly.

You could tell from how Joanna's meetups with us became less frequent that Ronnie was hitting some major milestones.

"As I said, this is the trickiest part. If this gets out, Ronnie's reputation will definitely take a hit. We need to come up with a foolproof plan."

Royce finally spoke up, "He's already part of someone else's scheme, and Maeve is likely a bribe. Are you still worried about his future?"

"He couldn't resist temptation and has already wronged Joanna. You shouldn't feel any sympathy for him."

I paused, thinking Royce had a point.

Kathy sighed, "True, but we just feel bad for Joanna. If we can minimize the damage and impact, that would be best."

Royce dropped us off at Sunny Meadows and left, but Joanna saw him and they exchanged a brief greeting.

The three of us women sat down on the couch in the living room and started chatting.

"It's still early... let's go grocery shopping together later."

There's a big mall right outside Sunny Meadows, and the area is well-equipped.

Joanna nodded, "I already ordered takeout on my way here. It'll be delivered soon."

"What did you order? I'm cooking today, and you still ordered takeout?" I teased Joanna.

Like yesterday, I knew I had to be friendly first to get her to open up to me later.

Joanna glanced at me, "Don't worry, I didn't order any main dishes, just some bubble tea."

"I guess you won't be making bubble tea today, right?"

I laughed, "That's true. But if you want, I can learn to make it."

As I said that, I suddenly remembered when I first got married.

Back then, to please Brandon, I learned how to be a good wife and mother, even though I had my own career.

Learning to cook was part of that.

Looking back, it felt like all my efforts were in vain.

Joanna noticed my silence and tried to lighten the mood, "Don't bother learning to make bubble tea. Some things are better left to the professionals."

After that joke, the atmosphere between us became much more relaxed.

Kathy started talking to Joanna, "I heard from Caroline that you wanted me to join you for dinner, so she invited me?"

Joanna laughed, "Is that a problem?"

"You two are always together. Even when we visited Isadora at the hospital, it was you two. I'm a bit jealous."

Kathy laughed, "What's there to be jealous about? When Caroline was in trouble at home, she called me first, and I was the one who helped her out. It's only natural we're close!"

Joanna's eyes flickered, "I wish I had friends like that..."

"What do you mean? Aren't we your good friends?"

I pretended to be stern.

But I had a feeling Joanna had something on her mind. Otherwise, she wouldn't have said that.

Could it be that our conversation today would get Joanna to open up right from the start?

But Joanna smiled, snapping back to reality, "I didn't mean it that way. I just think you two are great, and I wish I had someone who was always with me."

Kathy blinked, "What's wrong? Is Ronnie not treating you well?"

"I heard the best couples are also good friends. You and Ronnie should be pretty close, right?"

I followed Kathy's lead.

We had time now, but we wouldn't be able to talk about this while grocery shopping.

If we didn't get any answers now, we could bring it up during dinner.

Joanna sighed, "Ronnie is a good person, but we're not really friends. And lately, we haven't been talking much."

Hearing this, Kathy and I exchanged a glance.

We weren't sure if we should probe further.

Bringing this up right after meeting might upset Joanna.

Or if we revealed too much, she might get suspicious...

Luckily, the doorbell rang, interrupting our conversation.

It was the takeout Joanna ordered, three bubble teas, each a different flavor.

"You even remembered what I like."

I looked at my bubble tea.

Joanna was known for her attention to detail, something everyone in our circle knew.

So I was glad Kathy and I didn't push the topic further.

Let's keep the warm, happy atmosphere a bit longer.

Joanna didn't notice anything unusual and we drank our bubble tea while watching TV. When it was time, we decided to head out.

I hadn't gone grocery shopping with others in a long time. I had delegated my work for the day, so I felt relaxed.

The three of us wandered through the supermarket, covering almost every section. By the time we finished shopping, we were all starving.

At the checkout, Joanna laughed at our purchases.

"Most people cook first and get hungry when the food's ready. We're already starving; will we be too hungry by the time the food's done?"

Her joke made Kathy and me laugh, "You made me feel guilty... it's our fault for leaving so late!"

We laughed and chatted as we left the supermarket, but as soon as we stepped outside, I saw a familiar figure across the street.

It was Maeve...

This time, Maeve didn't see me.

She was on the phone, walking with a seductive sway.

I thought about who might be on the other end of the call, probably Ronnie, and felt a chill.

Joanna was next to me and followed my gaze, spotting Maeve. She scoffed, "I haven't seen that woman in ages. Is she back in town?"

Kathy was the last to notice. When she saw Maeve, she instinctively looked at me.

I pretended to know nothing, "I have no idea... maybe she is."

Kathy said, "I think I heard someone mention she was back, but I'm not sure. Why is she around here?"

"Could her new lover be living in Sunny Meadows?"

Kathy and I didn't dare to think further.

###chapter 264

The only person who seemed totally chill about the whole Maeve situation was Joanna.

She was in high spirits, chatting and laughing with us on the way home.

Kathy and I exchanged glances and shared a knowing, weary smile.

We had no idea how to break the news to Joanna...

When we got home, we sorted out the stuff we bought, and Joanna was still talking about what had happened earlier.

"I didn't expect things to go so smoothly when I got Maeve to help Brandon... Now that I think about it, she really knows what she's doing."

I thought to myself, of course she does.

After all, she even managed to hook up with Ronnie.

Joanna and Kathy were helping me out, standing on either side of me, gossiping away.

The conversation gradually shifted from Maeve to the men she had been involved with.

Kathy, either intentionally or unintentionally, said, "When you got Maeve, who was she seeing at the time? To seduce Brandon, did she have to ditch her other guys first?"

Joanna laughed heartily, "If you put it that way, Maeve is definitely a hot commodity among those guys."

"But when she went after Brandon, she didn't seem to have any men around... Or maybe, her relationships were all in the shadows. They couldn't exactly tie her down, right?"

That made sense.

The three of us chatted while cooking, completely forgetting about our hunger.

When it was finally time to eat, Kathy and I exchanged another glance.

Honestly, just thinking about Maeve's condition made me feel a bit down.

Especially since the two of them had been talking about it non-stop, which made me worry about Joanna's situation even more.

Today, we had to get Joanna to open up about what was going on with her and Ronnie.

During dinner, Kathy's phone kept buzzing with messages, and Joanna and I teased her about having some new developments.

"Did you start dating someone these past few days?"

Kathy put down her phone and rolled her eyes at us, "You guys are ridiculous."

"It's just work messages. I'm replying to them."

Busy bee, I thought.

But then I remembered the situation with Yvonne. Could she be causing trouble again?

I quickly asked, "It's not Yvonne giving you trouble again, is it?"

Royce had told me he had cut ties with Yvonne and wouldn't let her bother us anymore.

But knowing Yvonne, if she found out that anything she did would be reported to Royce, would she turn her anger towards Kathy instead?

Kathy shook her head, "Don't worry, it's not Yvonne this time."

Hearing us mention Royce's name, Joanna raised an eyebrow, "Why are you suddenly talking about Royce?"

She looked at me with a gossipy smile, "Speaking of which, Caroline, how are things with you and Royce lately?"

I felt a bit helpless.

Considering how Royce had been pursuing me and trying to explain things...

Just thinking about it made my heart race a little, "We're the same as before."

Kathy's eyes widened, "So you two made up?"

Joanna frowned, "What do you mean 'the same as before'? You two haven't even defined your relationship yet."

Kathy turned to me, "Wait, what do you mean by 'made up'? Did you and Royce have a fight?"

Their questions came at me one after another, leaving me a bit flustered.

"I didn't come here today to let you guys gossip about us..."

I tried to steer the conversation away.

But they wouldn't let it go, "Then why did you want to meet up?"

"Yeah, we're friends, aren't we supposed to talk about these things?"

Kathy even gave me a knowing look.

I suddenly realized something.

If we wanted to get Joanna to open up today, I had to start by sharing some of my own relationship stuff.

Just like before we started cooking, we had already touched on the topic, and Joanna seemed ready to talk about some specifics.

But we thought it was too early and weren't prepared, so we didn't continue.

Now might be the right time.

With that in mind, I organized my thoughts, "If you really want to hear it, I guess I can tell you."

"Of course we want to hear it," Joanna and Kathy said eagerly, their eyes fixed on me.

One was eating a sandwich, the other was munching on chicken wings, but both had the same gossipy expression.

I sighed and started from when Yvonne showed up at the party.

"Kathy knows about this too."

I had Kathy fill in some details.

Kathy nodded, "I'm telling you, Joanna, I knew from the first time I met Yvonne that she was trouble."

Yvonne's behavior that day had already hinted at her true nature.

It was only later, when she did something outrageous, that we realized there were so many details to the story.

"Basically, she sent me some really nasty texts, calling me an old woman, and sent pictures of her and Royce together to make me jealous."

Kathy added, "And on my end, she pretended to be a customer, placed an order, and then canceled it last minute, demanding a refund."

After hearing our stories, Joanna's mouth dropped open, "No way... Yvonne is shameless."

"Royce looks at you like he's about to burst with love, and yet there's still a woman who would go after him!"

Joanna's words made my heart flutter a bit.

So that's how Royce looked at me?

I had never noticed.

Although his persistent attitude over the past few days had moved me, making me feel like he cared about me.

But honestly, maybe because of all the past disappointments, I couldn't bring myself to believe that someone's love for me could be pure and untainted.

I said softly, "If you put it that way, I don't feel it at all."

"I know he likes me, but after everything I've been through, I just don't trust my own judgment anymore. What if this time, it's the same..."

Kathy quickly interjected, "Caroline, what are you talking about! You can't give up on love just because of one bad experience!"

"Look at us now, isn't there a happily married person sitting right here?"

Kathy gestured towards Joanna.

I knew this was Kathy's plan, the moment to get Joanna to talk.

Joanna was sitting across from us, just picking up another chicken wing, and looked at us as Kathy spoke.

###chapter 265

There was something off in her eyes.

Kathy burst out, "Come on, spill it! You and Ronnie are still going strong, right? Give us single folks some hope!"

I jumped in with a grin, "And me, the one who's already been married and divorced, I need some hope even more."

Joanna looked at us for a long moment before she finally smiled and set down her fork.

She spoke slowly, "There's really not much to say about marriage. Whether it's good or not, only you know."

"If you're looking for some confidence from me, I'm afraid I can't provide it."

Hearing Joanna's words, Kathy and I exchanged a glance.

Was she finally going to open up?

Joanna sighed, "It's not that Ronnie and I don't get along... We don't really have any issues in our daily interactions."

Kathy poked at her food, "Then what's the reason? Is it just the daily grind of married life that's wearing you down?"

Joanna nodded, then shook her head.

"Honestly, I don't know how to describe it. Even today, when I came to see you, I wanted to talk about it, but when it comes to actually saying it, I don't know how."

Seeing her hesitation, I thought we might finally get some useful information.

If we could find out Ronnie's recent state, their relationship, and Joanna's perspective, we could inform Royce.

Once Royce knew, he could set up a reasonable plan to investigate further.

Otherwise, we'd be stuck, not knowing whether to proceed.

Kathy took a sip of her milk tea, "You two don't seem to have any major issues. If it's just the daily grind, I get it. Marriage is different from dating."

I agreed, "Marriage and dating are really two different things."

"So you guys envy my relationship with Royce, but we haven't even officially started dating. I don't want to rush into a relationship... I'm afraid it will change! I'm more worried that once we make it official, he'll start thinking about marriage."

I couldn't help but smile bitterly.

"Look at me now. I might not look old, but I've been through a lot, and I have four kids. Even if Royce and I got married, I couldn't have more kids."

Thinking about what Kelly and others had said, I was always pessimistic about my future with Royce.

At a certain age, people seem to want their own children due to hormonal changes.

By then, I might not be able to have kids, and even if I could, I wouldn't have the energy.

With four kids now, I already feel very happy. I want to focus on raising them well.

That's my plan for now.

Joanna spoke softly, "If you put it that way... Ronnie and I don't have kids yet."

"Yeah, you've been married for a while. How come you don't have kids? Who doesn't want them?" Kathy asked.

Joanna shook her head, "At first, it was me."

"When we got married, his career was really taking off. I didn't want kids to mess with that, and I didn't want to be a stay-at-home mom... I didn't want to raise kids alone."

So, we didn't have any.

"A couple of years ago, I started thinking about it. His career had stabilized, and I thought maybe we should have a kid. But surprisingly, he didn't agree."

Hearing the turn in Joanna's story, my heart tightened.

Maeve had appeared around that time. Could it be related?

Joanna continued, "We've talked about it several times. He never really expressed his opinion. He just said he was too busy with work and didn't have the energy."

She looked at us, seeming a bit embarrassed.

"To be honest, we haven't had a physical relationship in a long time."

Kathy was shocked, "So this lack of energy includes that too?"

Joanna nodded, "Pretty much."

"And at my age, you can't keep asking if he wants to have sex or kids."

I sighed, "It's true that being busy with work can cause that."

"I thought so too, but in the past two years, he's been acting more and more off..."

Joanna hesitated, looking at us.

"Especially in the past few months, he hasn't touched me at all. I even thought maybe our feelings had faded, and I should be more proactive, but he always rejected me."

Hearing this, Kathy and I both sighed in relief.

We had been worried that Maeve's illness might have infected Ronnie.

Or rather, we were almost certain.

Given their affair, Ronnie was likely already a carrier.

Our only concern now was Joanna.

Joanna, unaware of our thoughts, was lost in her own, "We barely communicate anymore. In the past six months, he's been talking less and less. After work, he goes straight to his study."

"And since we don't have kids, sometimes I feel trapped. I could get a divorce, but people say I'm lucky to have Ronnie."

This situation left Joanna indecisive.

I couldn't help but sigh, "People don't understand the pain until it happens to them."

"When I was drugged and barely escaped, my neighbors knew and said Brandon must have made a mistake in a moment of weakness. They even hoped I wouldn't get divorced."

If it weren't for my friends' unwavering support, I wouldn't have been able to get out.

"Brandon was good at pretending to be a good husband. Who would have thought he had such a sinister plan..."

Thinking about my past with Brandon, the three of us shuddered.

Joanna sighed deeply, took a napkin to wipe her mouth, and leaned back in her chair.

"Honestly, when I went to the hospital that day, I was envious of Isadora. Her husband dotes on her, and now she has a baby and has recovered so well."

"Isadora's life will be all about enjoying herself. As her child grows, she'll have something to rely on..."

###chapter 266

Hearing Joanna's sigh, Kathy and I exchanged a look.

Who could disagree?

We had the same thoughts when we visited Isadora.

Joanna gave a bitter smile. "Look at me, going on about this. I promised myself I wouldn't bring it up again."

"She even told me that if my husband isn't interested in me, it might be my fault. I've been doing a lot of research lately, thinking about having a serious talk with him, or maybe trying to spark some... you know, fire..."

I blurted out, "Don't do it!"

Joanna looked at me, puzzled. "You think it's too forward? But we've been married for so long..."

"That's not the issue," Kathy quickly interjected, trying to cover for me. "If a guy isn't interested in you, that's on him. He's so wrapped up in work! We shouldn't lower our worth by revolving around men."

Joanna managed a smile through her tears. "You have a point."

"If people only need novelty, then they constantly need new stimulation. I should just be myself."

After barely managing to calm Joanna down, Kathy and I finally felt at ease.

Later, Joanna talked more about her and Ronnie, seemingly unaware that Ronnie was seeing someone else.

But in the end, she brought up Maeve again.

I almost dropped my tea. "Why are we talking about Maeve again?"

Joanna frowned. "I just find her return a bit strange."

"Do you think she has some connections or someone backing her? Considering the trouble she caused before, and how she was kicked out of the country, everyone in our circle despised her."

"And now she's back, living well, wearing all designer brands..."

Joanna wasn't envious, just found it odd.

Kathy and I said, "Who knows? Maybe she has a powerful benefactor."

At least we managed to end that topic, and both Kathy and I breathed a sigh of relief.

After dropping Joanna off, Kathy collapsed on the couch.

"I have to say, this kind of comforting work really isn't for me."

I flopped down beside her, letting out a long sigh. "Tell me about it!"

"Watching Joanna earlier, I almost blurted out that Ronnie is having an affair, and it's with Maeve!"

Kathy excitedly patted my hand. "Me too, me too! Do you know how hard it was for me to keep quiet?"

We both laughed, but our smiles were bitter.

Seeing your friend's husband cheat is a tough situation for anyone.

If you tell your friend and they get divorced, it's a relief, and everyone can move on.

But if they don't, that thorn is something you planted.

Especially with Ronnie's complicated situation, what if he has some disease...

I couldn't bear to think about it.

"Do you have any plans this afternoon?" I remembered something I had planned and turned to ask Kathy.

Kathy shook her head. "Nothing planned. What's on your mind?"

"I want to visit Brandon at the police station."

The moment I said it, Kathy's expression changed. "Caroline, are you nuts? Why would you want to see Brandon now?"

"I know, but..."

I filled her in on running into Maeve and everything she said.

Kathy's eyes widened, and it took her a moment to process it.

"How is there another layer to this... I guess I was so focused on Joanna that I forgot Maeve was originally involved with Brandon."

"Exactly. But if we want more information, we need to explore every angle."

Even though I didn't want to see Brandon.

The last time I saw him was when he broke into my house.

Maeve had a lot of issues, but she was right about one thing.

Brandon was shameless to the core.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have called Maeve for help.

Kathy stood up. "We have nothing else to do now. If we stay here, we'll just keep thinking about Joanna. Let's go."

Doing something else would be a good distraction.

I nodded. "Sure, let's go."

It took us half an hour to get ready and leave.

The police station wasn't far from Sunny Meadows. On the way, I wondered if I should tell Royce.

But Royce messaged me first.

[Did you finish meeting with Joanna? How did it go?]

I was stunned for a moment.

How did he know we just finished lunch?

Did he put a tracker on me?

I sent him my suspicion.

Royce replied with an ellipsis, seemingly exasperated.

Then he sent another message.

[I wish I could put a tracker on you, but I'd rather put it on your heart.]

[That way, I wouldn't have to guess what you're thinking.]

His words made me blush.

I stared at my phone, speechless for a moment.

Kathy noticed and peeked at my screen. "Wow... Royce sure knows how to talk."

I cleared my throat. "Don't forget about Yvonne."

Kathy's expression changed. "He's just got bad taste! Caroline, if any other woman shows up around him, you tell me right away."

"You're too soft to argue with anyone. I'll do it for you."

We arrived at the police station, and after explaining our purpose, an officer led us to a holding room.

When Brandon was brought out and saw us through the glass, he froze.

Then his eyes lit up, and he almost lunged at his seat.

"Caroline, I knew it. After all these years, you still care about me. Are you here to get me out?"

Before I could react, Kathy exploded. "Brandon, you shameless jerk! You broke into Caroline's house and got arrested, and now you think she'd come to save you?"

Kathy couldn't stand Brandon's nonsense and snapped at him.

I frowned at him. "I'm not here to save you. Stop dreaming."

Brandon squinted. "Then why are you here?"

###chapter 267

Brandon's squinting eyes reminded me of a venomous snake slithering in the dark.

Even after being locked up in the police station for so long, he hadn't changed a bit.

I had long lost any sympathy for Brandon. Just seeing his face now filled me with disgust, even making me feel a bit nauseous.

But for Joanna's sake, I had to gather information from any possible source.

With that in mind, I held Kathy's hand and said to Brandon, "After all this time in here, have you regretted anything yet?"

"Regret?" Brandon shot back, "Do you think I..."

But halfway through his sentence, he frowned.

Maybe he was considering my attitude.

Brandon suddenly gave me a meaningful look.

Meeting his gaze, I felt an inexplicable irritation.

If it weren't for this accident, my life could have been so happy, without any deviation from its path!

Looking at Brandon in front of me, how could I not hate him?

Even though Royce had helped me handle everything, and I was relatively happy now, having found my lost child, there was still hatred in my heart.

"Brandon, answer my question."

Kathy's eyes darted around, as if she had an idea, and she said to him, "We came to see you today. If you behave well, maybe we can put in a good word for you in a few days, be a witness for you."

I knew Kathy's words were just empty promises.

Even with a light sentence, Brandon would still have to serve at least ten days to a couple of weeks.

That time would be enough for him to learn his lesson. Besides, he had nothing left now. What could he do even if he got out?

I certainly wouldn't take him back. Who would he turn to?

But when people are desperate, they'll cling to any lifeline, even if it's a venomous snake.

Sure enough, after hearing Kathy's words, Brandon suddenly started crying, "Caroline, I knew you wouldn't be so heartless after all these years of marriage."

Before I could respond, Brandon continued, "I've really learned my lesson during this time, and I've been thinking a lot about our past together..."

"We're still husband and wife. I know I was wrong before. Can you give me another chance?"

"And we have kids together. Can you really bear to let them see us divorce like this?"

His words made me feel sick, not moved.

We had been divorced for a long time, and the kids had already accepted it. How could Brandon still use this as an excuse?

"Do you really regret it? Then why did you show up at my house?"

Brandon was taken aback by my question, "Wasn't it because I missed you?"

I scoffed, "You missed me? If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place?"

"When someone steps into the abyss, how can they know the path they're on? Everyone deserves a second chance, don't they?"

If someone didn't know the truth, they might be moved by his words and think about giving him another chance.

But not me.

Through the glass window, Kathy squeezed my hand.

Maybe she was worried I'd be swayed by his words.

I felt a bit helpless.

Because I hadn't been decisive before, my friends now saw me as indecisive...

At least in some situations.

I cleared my throat, "Since you regret it, what do you plan to do after you get out?"

Brandon's eyes lit up, as if he thought I was really moved.

"When I get out, the first thing I'll do is find a job and start over. I won't bother you or the kids unless everything is settled."

"I'll find a job, get an income, rent a place, and live well. When I feel everything is better, I'll ask to see the kids..."

Brandon was already planning his future.

But to me, his words were just ironic.

"You've got it all figured out."

Brandon looked at me, "Don't you believe me? If I wasn't a decent person, why did you marry me in the first place?"

Of course, because I was deceived by Brandon!

I kept that thought to myself, not wanting to provoke him.

I still had questions for him.

But Brandon started crying again, tears streaming down as if he was truly moved by his own words.

He kept talking about his mistakes and his plans for the future.

I didn't believe a word of it. Watching his performance made me feel disoriented.

After all the wrongs Brandon had done, he now wanted to wipe the slate clean?

Finally, Kathy couldn't take it anymore, "Brandon, shut up!"

"All this talk is disgusting! Think about it, if Caroline had drugged you back then, how would you feel now?"

"Do you think a few empty promises and some tears are enough?"

Listening to Kathy scold him, I felt very calm inside.

Time had passed, and I was no longer the person I used to be.

Sensing my firm attitude, Brandon sneered, "So you were just playing me, giving me false hope, right?"

"Watching me cry and regret in front of you, does that make you feel good?"

Sure enough, once he realized we weren't there to help him, his true colors showed.

Kathy laughed, "Why would someone like you deserve help? If a few promises could get you out, what would we need the police for?"

Realizing we were in the police station, Kathy lowered her voice.

Seeing my cold demeanor, Brandon leaned back, "Then why are you here? You can't just be here to see me, right?"

"Does seeing me like this benefit you in any way?"

I finally couldn't hold back, "Of course it does."

"Seeing you like this is nothing compared to how I was bedridden. Do you know, Brandon, if I were more vindictive, I would have given you the same drug you gave me! I'd lock you up, drug you every day, make you as dazed as I was, and then kick you out like trash."

These were words I had wanted to say to him for a long time.

Now that I had said them, my expression showed no mercy.

Brandon stared at me for a long time, his gaze complicated.

###chapter 268

"Wow, you really can't stand me, huh? No wonder you were so quick to send me to the cops."

"You're heartless. I know you're living the high life now-rich, new guy, kids all around you. Why are you still coming after me?"

I didn't even bother to respond.

"Let's cut to the chase. I'm here to make a deal."

Getting us to say something nice isn't hard, especially since Brandon's case isn't closed yet. There's still one last public prosecution.

As witnesses and victims, our testimonies are crucial.

It all depends on whether we're willing to give him another chance.

Brandon perked up, intrigued. "What kind of deal?"

Maybe even he doubted he had anything left to offer me...

I said seriously, "Did you contact Maeve from prison?"

Brandon's face changed, clearly surprised I knew about it. "How did you find out?"

"Doesn't matter how I know. I just need an answer."

I stared at him for a long time before he finally spoke. "I did call her when I was desperate because I heard she was back."

"Who told you that?" Kathy asked.

Our combined questioning made Brandon frown even more.

"I don't get it. Why are you asking about Maeve? Are you trying to settle old scores?"

Seeing his confusion, I realized he knew nothing about Maeve's illness.

But that meant Brandon was pretty lucky. He hadn't shown any symptoms yet, or he'd have gone mad by now.

Wouldn't he have had a medical check in prison? Did they find nothing?

This made me doubt Maeve's illness even more.

Maeve looked well-maintained, judging by her Facebook and the last time I saw her up close. She didn't show any obvious signs of illness.

Could it all be hidden?

These thoughts filled me with doubt.

Brandon was getting impatient. "If you want to make a deal, at least show some sincerity. I don't even know why you're asking me or what you want! What's the point of asking about Maeve?"

He clearly didn't know the whole story.

I started to feel conflicted.

Was it a mistake to come to Brandon for information?

He had contacted Maeve before. If he reached out to her after our visit, it could alert her.

This made me uneasy.

If Maeve got suspicious, my conversation with her might not go well...

This would definitely affect Joanna too.

Kathy, however, asked, "The deal is about Maeve. Just tell us everything you know about her!"

"How did you two meet? What collaborations did you have? Why did you contact her last time? Tell us everything."

Kathy's fiery nature bombarded Brandon with questions, leaving him speechless.

After a while, Brandon looked uneasy, glancing between me and Kathy.

He seemed unsure of what to say.

But under our pressure, he finally said, "I can't tell you. At least not now."

Was it because of the police or Maeve?

I didn't know, but seeing we couldn't get anything from him, Kathy and I decided to leave.

Visiting time was limited anyway.

Today was a bust, but at least we confirmed one thing.

Maeve had a bigger backer than we thought.

And Brandon's case had hidden depths we couldn't uncover yet. I planned to tell Royce to investigate, or maybe Simon.

This matter was too tangled and would take time to unravel.

Seeing us about to leave, Brandon got agitated. "Don't treat this like a circus. Did you come here just to watch a show?"

"You admitted it yourself. What else is there to say? If you'd been honest from the start, we wouldn't be here."

I threw this line at him and pulled Kathy away.

Since we couldn't get any information from Brandon, even looking at him disgusted me.

But after leaving the police station, I felt a bit down.

Today had been unproductive.

Our conversation with Joanna only confirmed Ronnie's infidelity, and we identified Maeve as the other woman.

But Joanna didn't give us deeper information.

She felt trapped in her marriage, her relationship with Ronnie wasn't great, and they had no kids. She was torn about staying together.

But her hesitation showed she still had some attachment to Ronnie.

How could we tell her about this?

I sighed deeply, at a loss for words.

Kathy, noticing, shook my hand and said, "Caroline, don't worry. We discovered this together, so we'll solve it together."

"When Joanna brought Maeve in, we knew but didn't stop it. I had my reasons... I didn't want to burden you with more worries."

Kathy sighed.

"Who knew it would come to this? If I'd known, I wouldn't have let Joanna..."

I quickly patted Kathy's hand.

Who could predict the future?

We took it one step at a time, and here we are.

"We'll just have to deal with things as they come."

I shrugged, trying to comfort Kathy.

We had dressed up for our meeting with Joanna. Now, standing outside the police station, we exchanged glances and suddenly felt like laughing.

Sometimes, life is just absurd.

###chapter 269

"After all the trouble to meet up with a good friend and ending up with nothing, I can't help but find it laughable."

I nodded. "Yeah, I feel the same, but let's not dwell on it."

"The most important thing now is to contact everyone we can and figure out what to do about this."

Our biggest worry was whether Joanna had contracted the disease, but knowing she hadn't been intimate with Ronnie recently gave us some relief.

However, this also indirectly confirmed that Ronnie had indeed been seduced by Maeve.

Kathy added, "You know what's the weirdest part about this whole thing?"

"If we follow her timeline, the time Ronnie stopped being intimate with her coincides exactly with when you and Brandon had that huge fallout."

I took a deep breath. "You think there's a connection?"

"I don't know why, but I feel like this isn't just a simple case of cheating. Ronnie is smart and ambitious; it's unlikely he'd let a woman derail his progress."

When Joanna and Ronnie first got together, we all thought he was a good guy, but now no one dares to say that anymore.

"Actually, Royce had a similar thought. When he first heard about this, he suggested that Maeve might be a bribe from someone to Ronnie."

I shared Royce's theory with Kathy.

Kathy's eyes widened. "I have to admit, Royce is thorough! I hadn't even considered that angle, but now that you mention it, it makes sense..."

"Regardless, we need to find a way to check if Joanna is infected. Then we can talk to her and see if she wants a divorce."

This situation was giving us a headache, especially since Joanna is very perceptive and intolerant of deceit.

For now, we could only take it one step at a time.

As I was about to take Kathy home, my phone buzzed with a new message.

It was from Maeve!

Staring at the screen, I froze. Kathy seemed to sense something. "Who messaged you?"

I showed her the screen.

Kathy's eyes widened. "You actually exchanged contact info with her? This is real?"

"Why would I lie? When he told me, he seemed so serious. I think Brandon is hiding something. He's got nothing to lose now, so we need to be cautious."

I glanced at Maeve's message.

[Caroline. We've had each other's contact for a few days now, why haven't you messaged me?]

[What do you think about what I mentioned before?]

Kathy, peering over my shoulder, nudged me. "Reply to her, quickly! If we can't get anything from Brandon, Maeve is our next best bet."

I sighed. "Why do you seem more excited about this than I am?"

"I can't help it. Joanna is my friend too, and we're all in the same circle! Plus, this whole thing is so mysterious, it's got me curious."

With Kathy's encouragement, I sent a few messages back to Maeve.

Surprisingly, Maeve was evasive in her responses. She didn't seem willing to discuss much over WhatsApp.

Sensing this, I asked, [If you don't want to share more information, why contact me?]

Maeve quickly replied, [If you're available, let's meet in person to talk.]

She added that she would only meet me alone, and if I brought anyone else, she wouldn't share any useful information.

Seeing this, I clenched my teeth. Kathy saw it too. "She's really cautious... Looks like you have to meet her."

I felt the same. But I wasn't sure how to face Maeve. Knowing she was infected made me uneasy. I couldn't shake the feeling that being near her would make me sick too, even though I knew it was irrational.

"What should I do? I want to go with you," Kathy pouted. "It's not just because I'm nosy and curious, but I feel uneasy about you meeting Maeve alone."

I knew she was thinking about what happened with Yvonne, worried I'd be at a disadvantage. I said, "It's okay. Maeve reached out to me, so she must want something. Even though I don't know what leverage I have, she needs something from me, so it's fine."

If Maeve wanted to target me, she wouldn't need to worry about what I might do. "Don't forget, when we caught her with Ronnie, Maeve was clearly scared."

Kathy speculated, "Do you think the person who assigned Maeve this task told her to keep a low profile with Ronnie?"

This led us to wonder if Maeve's return was to complete this task.

After parting with Kathy, I went to the café Maeve suggested. Maeve chose a place called Café Serenity, which was elegantly decorated. I realized I hadn't taken the time to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee in a long time. Especially after finding my child, my days were consumed by work and home...

Lost in thought, I saw someone waving at me from a corner. I looked up and saw Maeve sitting there. She wore a red dress, the deep burgundy enhancing her allure. If you only looked at her appearance, she was indeed a woman who could attract men. Even women might take a second glance. But knowing about her illness and her actions... I didn't know how to face her.

I walked over and sat across from Maeve. "Why did you want to meet today?"

Maeve smiled. "You meet me in a café and don't even order a coffee? Straight to the point?"

"Otherwise, I wouldn't have come."

My bluntness caught Maeve off guard. But knowing our conversation might take a while, I opened the menu and ordered a latte. "I haven't been to a café in a long time."

While waiting for the coffee, I said this to Maeve.

###chapter 270

Maeve chuckled, "Now that's more like it. We should ease into things with some small talk before getting to the heavy stuff."

"Do you take it slow with those guys you approach too?" I couldn't help but ask.

Maeve frowned, "That wasn't very nice."

"I'm never nice when I talk to you."

"Fair enough," Maeve sighed.

After our coffees arrived, Maeve stirred hers with a small spoon.

"Don't think I'm being hard on you. I actually respect you a lot. I was with another friend today, and when I saw your message, she wanted to come along, but I turned her down."

I decided to open up to Maeve.

Maeve smirked, a bit sarcastically, "So I should thank you, then?"

"No need to thank me. Just don't hold back today. I don't want us to have another one-on-one meeting."

Maybe it was today's events that made me particularly irritable, and I couldn't muster any kindness in my tone with Maeve.

After studying me for a while, Maeve took a couple of sips of her coffee before speaking slowly, "So, I hear you've already met with Joanna. You didn't tell her about this, did you?"

I shook my head, "We haven't mentioned it to her yet."

"Good."

"But it's not because you told me to," I added.

Maeve frowned, "Regardless, I can sense your willingness to negotiate."

"I'm curious about what kind of deal you want to make. You've been so secretive, refusing to tell me anything on WhatsApp, insisting on meeting in person, and then talking about taking things step by step..."

I frowned, "I don't have time to play games with you."

Maeve asked, "Why do you think I'm playing games? You know my secret now, so I want to make a deal. My only request is that you don't tell Joanna."

"Why not? If you and Ronnie are lovers, wouldn't you want to take advantage of the situation? Ronnie is capable, resourceful, and has a bright future. If he divorces Joanna, you could easily ask him to marry you."

I deliberately made my thoughts sound simple and shallow.

As expected, Maeve sneered, "I thought you had some brains. Clearly, you don't understand anything about this situation and are just making wild guesses."

"Then tell me."

Maeve paused, then took a few more sips of her coffee.

"I came to talk about a deal, not to give you details or information."

"You have demands, and so do I. I want to know what you're thinking and why you approached Ronnie."

I decided to lay out the suspicions Kathy and I had.

Maeve was silent for a long time before finally speaking, "You know what I mean."

"Ronnie and I aren't what you think. I have no real feelings for him. I just want something."

I listened, my frown deepening. My heart was racing. Maybe it was because I had uncovered someone else's secret and didn't know how to handle it. This was something I had never imagined. Brandon's affair was already hard enough to deal with, and now I had to handle my friend's issues too.

Maeve must have sensed my hesitation and said seriously, "I told you before, I have dirt on Brandon. With it, you can control him. No matter when he gets out of prison, you'll have leverage over him."

"But what good is that to me? I already have control over him. Last time he tried to mess with me, I had him thrown back in jail."

I didn't think Brandon was hard to deal with. But I agreed with Maeve on one thing: Brandon had nothing to lose now, while those of us with happy lives had more to worry about. But I had many friends and Royce's help, so I didn't think it would be too difficult.

Maeve sneered, elegantly stirring her coffee. But her smile made me uncomfortable.

I frowned, "Honestly, if you hadn't insisted on meeting alone today, I wouldn't be here talking to you."

"I know, you've said that many times," Maeve smiled, more relaxed than before. Maybe she sensed how much I cared about Joanna. Joanna was my friend, and I didn't want anything bad to happen to her, putting me in a tough spot.

"No matter what information you want from me, all I can tell you is not to tell Joanna. Her husband will eventually come back to her, and I guarantee Joanna will never find out, as long as you keep quiet," Maeve reiterated.

I was about to lose my temper, but Maeve continued, "By the way, I know you visited Brandon in prison today."

"This makes me wonder, did you ask him about me?"

Maeve was surprisingly sharp. She wouldn't be easy to deal with, I realized immediately. But then I thought, maybe someone behind her was secretly controlling everything, even knowing what Kathy and I were doing. My back stiffened, and I felt a cold sweat coming on.

Seeing my reaction, Maeve smiled, "Don't worry, I didn't have anyone follow you. I just heard about it."

"You're very concerned about my actions."

"Of course. Brandon is unforgettable to me. You can't imagine what we've been through."

I had no interest in that. Meeting with Maeve was draining my patience. I felt she didn't intend to reveal anything specific, just testing if I had told Joanna about her.

As I pondered how to proceed, Maeve suddenly changed the topic.

"By the way, you've been spending a lot of time with Royce lately. Brandon mentioned it."

"Are you two together?"

###chapter 271

Hearing Royce's name made my heart skip a beat. "What does this have to do with you?"

"Don't get so worked up."

Maeve called over the waiter and ordered a piece of cake for me, but as it sat in front of me, I had no appetite at all.

"I've had some interactions with Royce before, but not in the way you're thinking. He's not part of our circle, and I don't have any tasks targeting him. So, he's still a clean guy, you can relax..."

Maeve spoke while watching my expression closely.

She must have noticed the subtle changes in my face.

Hearing Maeve mention Royce made me extremely nervous, especially when she said Royce was still clean...

That statement made my mind race.

It even felt a bit scary.

If Royce had interacted with Maeve before, then he...

Who should I trust now?

But thinking about how Royce had acted in front of me, it seemed like he and Maeve didn't have any history. And honestly, Royce seemed like someone who valued himself.

If he could immediately guess that Maeve was being used as a bribe, did that mean...

Suddenly, I felt a rush of blood and couldn't sit still. "Excuse me, I need to use the restroom."

I had expected my confrontation with Maeve to be calm or at least a bit confrontational.

But that was assuming we were on the same level.

Now, it felt like she had the upper hand, and I couldn't get the answers I wanted.

Maeve always had her own rhythm.

Just as I thought before, she was a very smart woman.

If someone was really supporting Maeve and giving her these tasks, it also meant...

At the very least, Maeve was smart and valuable enough to be used.

With these uneasy thoughts, I walked towards the restroom.

But as soon as the door closed, I couldn't help but think about what to do next.

Images of Joanna and Brandon flashed through my mind.

Everything was making me anxious.

I lingered in the restroom for a long time, even touching up my makeup in the mirror.

But when I came out and planned to continue the conversation with Maeve...

I saw an unexpected figure by our table.

Royce was standing there, talking to Maeve. They weren't very close, but it was clear they knew each other.

Royce was wearing a brown trench coat, with a white shirt and black pants underneath. He looked particularly handsome and cheerful.

Someone like him in a café would easily attract attention, especially now, seeing Maeve smiling at him made me feel a mix of fear and anxiety.

Maeve had mentioned she knew a bit about Royce and had interacted with him before...

Now seeing them talking together, I felt rooted to the spot.

At that moment, they both seemed to sense something.

Maeve looked over at me and said something to Royce with a smile.

Royce turned and waved at me.

Seeing me, his face showed no sign of discomfort, as if everything was perfectly normal.

I forced down my emotions and walked towards them. Maeve had already stood up.

In front of us, Maeve adjusted her skirt and picked up her bag, elegantly saying goodbye.

"That's it for today, Caroline. It was nice chatting with you. I hope we can meet again."

I thought to myself, I hope not.

But knowing our unresolved issues, I knew this scene would likely repeat.

I just didn't know if Maeve would always lead me by the nose.

Thinking this made me feel a bit down, and I hadn't snapped out of it even as Maeve left.

Royce waved a hand in front of my face. "What's wrong? She left, and your soul went with her?"

I looked up at him. "Why add 'too'? Did your soul fly away with Maeve?"

Royce was caught off guard by my sudden outburst and then laughed. "Are you getting jealous over someone insignificant?"

"Do you think someone like Maeve and I could ever be a thing?"

I scoffed. "Who knows? She told me you two had some history. And I just saw you talking."

"Don't you remember? I know about Maeve because of what she's done before. Maeve has interacted with men in our circle, including my friends."

Royce frowned deeply as he mentioned this.

"For privacy reasons, I can't tell you about my friends."

Is that all?

I wasn't sure I believed him.

But Royce pinched my cheek. "If you were jealous of Yvonne, I'd understand, but Maeve? No way."

"And I've already cut ties with others for you, so don't do this to me."

I hesitated but said, "Okay."

Too much suspicion would only mess with my mind.

Until Joanna's issue was resolved, I didn't want to become a bitter person.

Royce then asked, "Did you get the flowers I sent you today?"

"Where did you send them? To the office?" I shifted the conversation.

Royce nodded and naturally took my hand. "I sent them to the office, but from your reaction, you probably haven't been there today."

"I'll be going tomorrow... I need to help Asher with some contract stuff."

Royce nodded. "I can take you there in the morning."

Once we were in the car, Royce asked about my conversation with Joanna.

"When you messaged me earlier, you didn't give details."

I thought for a moment and recapped our talk, including some personal details about Joanna and Ronnie.

"...I'm telling you this to say Joanna probably isn't at risk of illness right now, so don't worry. But we didn't get her stance on divorce, and from what she said today, it seems she's still attached to Ronnie."

Royce nodded. "That's natural. They've been married for years."

He kept talking, but I was still thinking about Maeve and Royce's conversation.

I felt a bit tense.

After a while, Royce said, "But we can't drag this out. Can you find a way to get Joanna to have a check-up?"

###chapter 272

Royce's words snapped me out of my thoughts.

I couldn't even remember what Maeve had just said to him.

I widened my eyes and looked at Royce standing in front of me. "Why are we rushing to get the test done now?"

Royce frowned. "Do you really want to wait until the preliminary test to find out the results?"

I bit my lip.

Royce was right. Since we were now certain that Maeve and Ronnie had an inappropriate relationship, it was best to get Joanna tested as soon as possible.

And today, while talking to Kathy, I remembered that the first person to show symptoms of those nasty diseases was actually Brandon.

Back then, I hadn't managed to escape from home yet. Under his confinement, he suggested we share a room to keep an eye on me. The scars on his body were so obvious...

It hadn't been that long, and I had almost forgotten.

I even suspected that Maeve had transmitted the disease to Brandon.

But thinking about Maeve's calm demeanor when facing me, she didn't seem to have any special feelings for Brandon. I worried that both of them might be carriers of some kind of virus.

"What are you thinking about?"

Royce seemed to notice I was lost in thought and waved his hand in front of my face.

He pulled me out of the café, his warm hand tightly wrapping around mine.

At that moment, I suddenly felt a sense of peace.

Royce was such a clean-living person; he would never get involved with someone like Maeve.

I smiled. "Nothing, just suddenly thought of something."

"What is it?"

We had been talking about Joanna's blood test, but now that I mentioned something else, Royce followed my lead and changed the topic.

I told him about my conversation with Kathy today, without mentioning my talk with Maeve.

Royce nodded. "I actually knew about Brandon's illness too. I heard it from someone else."

"It's understandable that you forgot. After all, he should have been undergoing treatment since it was exposed at home, trying to cover it up a bit. But..."

Royce paused slightly. "According to what you said, his prison health report showed no issues. I suspect someone is protecting him behind the scenes."

I was a bit surprised. "Even someone like him has an invisible hand controlling everything?"

"And if he knew someone was protecting him, why would he be so desperate to call Maeve?"

Royce shook his head. "I don't know... It's just a guess."

"And right now, this whole thing is getting more and more complicated."

He brought the topic back to Joanna's test, saying we should get it done as soon as possible.

"Honestly, it's best to get Joanna tested quickly. I can't approach her, so it's up to you and Kathy."

I bit my lip. "You're right. I'll discuss with Kathy how to handle this."

Royce nodded and added, "And it should be done naturally... or at least get a blood sample from her."

The detailed description from his mouth made me very nervous. "Do we really have to go that far?"

I thought we could just come up with an excuse to trick Joanna into going to the hospital.

Royce sighed. "Why are you so scared of blood? It's hard to imagine you used to share a bed with someone like that."

Hearing Royce bring up Brandon, I immediately felt uneasy.

Since I met Royce, I rarely talked about Brandon.

At most, I mentioned I had a failed marriage and that Brandon was a jerk.

But Royce knew all about it, and he helped me with many things.

He probably knew a lot about my interactions with Brandon.

I thought about it and realized I rarely mentioned Brandon because I didn't want to face that past.

That's why I've been so desperate to find my lost child and resolve everything...

I wanted Brandon completely out of my life, to get the punishment he deserved, to rot somewhere.

So I rarely brought it up with Royce.

Now, hearing Royce mention Brandon, I remembered our earlier conversation and suddenly realized something. "Do you think I might have that disease too?"

I heard that disease had a long incubation period.

I couldn't imagine how long Brandon had been carrying the virus before showing symptoms after we got married...

After all, he used to be a male escort!

Thinking about that past, I felt ashamed and quickly looked away after speaking.

Royce saw my distress and hurriedly pulled me into the car, asking the driver to step out.

"Caroline, you're not in the right state of mind. You need to calm down."

But I didn't know how to calm down.

After finding out Brandon was sick, how could I not worry about myself?

During the time I left home, I went to the hospital for tests whenever I had a chance, almost obsessively.

Every time the results came back clean, I felt relieved for a moment, but then I'd fall into deep doubt again.

Later, so many things distracted me that I subconsciously beautified that past and almost forgot about it...

My friends understood my fear, so when Joanna approached Maeve, Kathy and the others hid the dirty disease from me.

Maybe they were afraid I'd remember those dark days.

Tears suddenly streamed down my face. "I got tested before. I'm definitely fine. I just had a few kids with him..."

I felt scared. "Do you think I need to get the kids tested too? But they're so young..."

Maybe my anxious state made Royce feel sorry for me. He grabbed my hand. "Caroline! I only mentioned that because I was jealous of you having feelings for another man before..."

"I was jealous! And thinking about such a despicable man having you made me feel worse."

"But I never doubted you had any disease. I like you, and it has nothing to do with that."

Hearing Royce's words, I slowly calmed down, staring at him without blinking. "Really?"

Royce sighed. "Of course it's true."

"But you just said..."

Mentioning sharing a bed was probably what triggered me.

###chapter 273

Royce smiled and pulled my hand closer, kissing the back of it without hesitation. "I was just jealous, that's all."

"The topic we were discussing was a bit sensitive, and jumping to my jealousy made you overthink. I'm sorry."

As he spoke, he kissed the back of my hand lightly again.

His gentleness was hard to resist.

"I never doubted you were sick. Even if, hypothetically, he could have infected you, he got sick after you two had already stopped being intimate, after you had your child and were bedridden..."

"I got all his medical reports. His issues started after you got sick and were bedridden, and it showed up on him quickly."

Thinking about the women Brandon was involved with and all those records made me feel nauseous.

"I remember those details too... When I was bedridden, he was with others..."

I couldn't continue.

It wasn't because of heartache or sadness, but pure disgust.

The physical nausea was hard to hide, and I even felt like throwing up.

I quickly changed the subject and asked Royce, "But how did you know all this?"

"When I was helping you with many things, Simon trusted me and gave me a lot of information."

This included information about Brandon and a series of medical records.

I nodded. "Got it."

"Are you feeling uncomfortable now? If you're still upset, let me know, and I'll help you through it."

Royce still held my hand, his gaze intense.

Meeting his eyes, I suddenly felt the sincerity in them.

Kathy was right; Royce was mostly gentle with me.

Whenever he sensed I was upset, he was the first to comfort me, determined to solve the problem completely.

In this regard, Royce was indeed good to me.

I looked at him and said softly, "But I did misunderstand earlier... I hope we don't talk about such ambiguous topics in the future."

That dark past was something I still didn't want to bring up.

Royce nodded emphatically. "Understood. I'll be more careful with my words and consider your feelings. But don't hold back your emotions. If you feel something, show it to me right away, like you did just now. That way, I'll know how to comfort you and explain things."

I nodded. "Okay."

Only then did I realize he was still holding my hand. Given our current relationship, it felt a bit too intimate.

I quickly pulled my hand back and cleared my throat. "I should go. My mom is waiting for me at home."

Royce saw this and covered his mouth with his hand to stifle a laugh.

I knew he was in a good mood.

Even though we both had a lot to do, his gentleness put me at ease.

Suddenly, I felt confident about what Maeve had said to him earlier. "By the way, I have something to ask you... What were you and Maeve talking about just now?"

Royce looked at me calmly. "When I was investigating Maeve, I found out who she's been involved with. I told you before, a friend of mine was also deceived by her."

"So I went over to give her a piece of my mind, a warning."

Thinking back, Royce's expression wasn't great when he was with her, but I had assumed they were just chatting.

I had indeed misunderstood him.

I said quietly, "I'm sorry. For a moment, I thought you had something going on with Maeve that you were hiding from me..."

Royce gave a bitter smile. "Do you really think I'm that kind of guy?"

I shook my head. "I know you're not, which is why I calmed down. Even if you did want another woman, you have plenty of choices around you."

Like Yvonne, right?

Royce seemed to know who I was referring to and frowned, pinching my cheek. "Didn't we agree not to be jealous about this anymore? I've already explained it to you."

"And I have no contact with her now. I warned her about what she did to you. She hasn't found a job yet, and all the companies related to me have rejected her resume..."

Royce said a lot in one breath.

I quickly smiled. "Alright, alright, you don't have to explain so much. I know you've cut ties with her."

Otherwise, my phone wouldn't be so quiet.

Yvonne hadn't contacted me in a long time.

I guessed it was because of Royce's warning.

Royce looked at me again. "But you just asked about Maeve and brought up Yvonne. Can I take that as you being jealous?"

"I... I'm not..."

I instinctively wanted to deny it.

But the heat rising in my cheeks betrayed me, and I realized I did care about him.

Maybe it was because I'd been so unsettled after hearing about Joanna...

Royce read something in my flustered expression and happily hugged me.

The back seat of the car was narrow, even in Royce's luxury car.

This made our bodies very close when he hugged me.

I could even feel the heat of his heartbeat through his chest.

I wanted to push Royce away, but feeling his warmth, I couldn't help but hug him back.

"If I said I care about you, would you still pursue me?"

Royce answered without hesitation, "Of course."

"Even if you already like me, I'll keep pursuing you until you agree to be with me."

I laughed through my tears. "Really? Isn't it said that once a man knows he has a chance or has succeeded, he won't cherish it?"

Royce shook his head seriously and said above my head, "Not me. Maybe other men, but I would never do that."

"I'm serious about you."

Hearing him say that again filled my heart with sweetness.

I hugged him tightly, savoring the moment of peace.

Until the driver got in, glanced at us through the rearview mirror, and I felt a bit guilty.

The car started, and Royce still held my hand tightly.

At that moment, I really wanted to say yes to him.

But then I thought about how it was the first time someone had pursued me for so long, and I wanted to enjoy this feeling a bit longer.

I selfishly wanted to prolong this feeling...

###chapter 274

That night, I slept like a baby, especially after a call from Royce before bed.

We talked about our plans for the next few days, and the next morning, I headed to the office to take care of Asher's business.

Asher's contract couldn't be delayed any longer, or it would mess up his project timeline.

As soon as I walked into the conference room, I heard Asher talking with someone.

"What's going on?" I asked, pushing the door open.

Asher was with one of his new business associates, someone I had met briefly before but whose name I couldn't remember.

"Aren't we here to finalize the contract? You guys sounded like you were about to argue and gave me a scare."

Asher laughed, "Why would we argue? We're just hashing out some project details. Caroline, you know how I am. I can get a bit intense when I talk."

I smiled, "People who know you understand, but don't scare off the new folks."

His associate chuckled, "Exactly. I almost quit last month because he was so harsh."

I couldn't help but laugh, "Maybe it's because you're not a woman."

Asher rolled his eyes, "I'm here to handle the contract, and you're already giving me a hard time? When have I ever let personal feelings interfere with business?"

True enough. Even when Brandon tried to undermine me by bribing Asher with attractive women, Asher stayed loyal to the company and me, which eventually led Brandon to use more ruthless tactics against him.

Thinking about it made my hatred for Brandon grow even stronger.

"I've got the contract ready. Today, we just need to confirm the details and sign. Then you can start the project."

Asher thanked me, "Thanks. This project is a new beginning for me, and I'll give it my all."

I nodded, "You should. There are a lot of eyes on this project. I even held a special press conference for you. If you don't do well, you'll be letting me down."

Asher became serious, "Of course. I won't disappoint you."

An hour later, we finished the contract. I had also called in other assistants to help confirm some details.

Business is business, and even though Asher is like a brother to me, I wouldn't overlook any details.

"Here's to a successful partnership," I said, extending my hand.

Asher shook it firmly, "Caroline, thank you. I won't let you down. I'll work hard."

I smiled, "Good. I'll be waiting for the results of our first review."

After a while, Asher sent his associate away.

I knew he had something to discuss privately, so I asked my assistant to leave as well.

"What's up?" I asked.

Asher sighed, "Caroline, now that we're partners, I won't hide anything from you."

My heart sank, "Don't tell me there's a problem with the contract. We just signed it!"

"Do you think I'm that kind of person? If there were issues, I wouldn't have signed it."

I pouted, "Then what's going on? You're making me anxious."

Asher finally spoke, "It's about Alfonso. I heard some things on my way here."

"Alfonso? I almost forgot about him."

Thinking about how he had once threatened me with my lost child made my blood boil. But I had been too busy to deal with him.

Now, he was lurking in the shadows while I was out in the open, leaving me with no choice but to react to his moves.

Asher continued, "It's not a big deal, but it made me uneasy, so I had to tell you."

He explained that Alfonso had been laying low, not because he was up to no good, but because he was pushing another project similar to Asher's.

Alfonso's project, however, was vastly different from his original proposal. He had been making bold claims at public events and bidding meetings, saying his project would shock everyone and bring huge profits to his company.

"He's a tough competitor, and his company has some reputation. His statements have attracted a lot of partners. I'm worried his high-profile approach might affect our project."

Asher's concerns were valid. This was a critical time for us, with many uncertainties.

Moreover, some of our partners were new, and we didn't know their character or have established relationships, relying solely on trust and mutual benefit.

"Our projects are launching simultaneously. I'm worried my meticulous approach might not compete with his aggressive tactics. If he has any tricks up his sleeve, he could steal our thunder, and our project would be criticized."

Asher was visibly anxious, rubbing his hands as he spoke.

I gently reassured him, "Asher, you're just overthinking. This is a big project, but you won the bid on your own merit and your company's potential."

"Winning the bid proves your company can handle it."

"Your hesitation is what's affecting your performance."

Asher blinked, "You know, Caroline, you kind of snapped me out of it."

"That's my intention. What you're worried about is irrelevant. Even if Alfonso is capable, he has to start from scratch. If he tries to copy your project, it won't succeed."

###chapter 275

"Everyone knows our project is already making waves. I even held a big press conference. He's our competitor. You think no one's keeping an eye on him right now?"

I spoke earnestly, trying to drive my point home.

When it comes to business, I've always had my own perspective, heavily influenced by Gerald.

When Gerald was still alive, he often told me that the business world is full of copycats, but the ones who succeed are those who can do something just a little bit different.

I repeated Gerald's words to Asher, "You gotta believe you won the bid because of your own skills."

Asher slapped his thigh, "You're right. I shouldn't be so worried... otherwise, I'd be letting you all down."

I nodded, "Glad you see it that way. Now, focus on your project. Leave the rest to me. If Alfonso makes any moves, let me know."

Asher agreed and left. Just as he walked out, someone else came in.

Seeing Simon, I was pleasantly surprised, "What brings you to the office?"

Simon usually preferred to meet outside and rarely came to my office. After I managed to regain control of my company, the first thing I wanted to do was invite him over, since he had helped me a lot. But he had been reluctant, only coming after much persuasion.

Simon looked a bit embarrassed, "I have something to discuss with you. Can we talk in your office?"

"Of course."

I asked my assistant to get him a glass of water and closed the door before we started talking.

Simon mentioned he knew about our plan to get a blood test for Joanna. "Royce is pretty busy right now. He's juggling a lot, including trying to win you over."

I felt a bit embarrassed, "Don't say that..."

"He doesn't spend much time on it."

Simon laughed, "Caroline, that's not fair. He spends half an hour just picking out flowers for you every day!"

"Really?" I blurted out.

I had no idea Royce was picking out flowers for me.

Simon chuckled, "Of course. He mentioned it while we were discussing something else."

"I see..."

I glanced at the bouquet on my desk. It had been delivered today. I hadn't been in the office much lately, and when I was, I was too busy to notice the flowers. Now that I looked, the arrangement was indeed elegant and fresh, with some new varieties.

If he was arranging these himself, it must have taken a lot of time. I felt a wave of gratitude.

Simon quickly said, "Caroline, let's not get sidetracked by Royce. I came here to discuss something important."

"Go ahead. Is it about Joanna?" I had a feeling I knew what he was going to say.

Simon nodded, "Yeah. I don't have much going on right now, so I figured I'd help you out with Joanna's situation."

"Really?" I was excited, "With your skills, getting a blood sample for testing should be a walk in the park."

"Don't overestimate me. Joanna isn't just anyone. With her father's status, I can't act recklessly."

We had all been cautious because of this. Ronnie had relied heavily on Joanna's connections. Her father's influence was still significant, even though he was nearing retirement.

We were unsure whether to intervene, fearing it might affect Joanna's family.

Simon said, "But you can trust me with the health check. I'll make some arrangements, but I'll keep it a secret from you to make it more convincing."

"Alright, I'll leave it to you. But since this is tricky, Kathy and I will also think of some ideas."

Simon suddenly asked, "Is Kathy still very busy?"

I sensed something unusual in his question, "Why are you suddenly interested in her?"

Simon stammered, unable to say much, his face turning red.

I realized something and laughed, "I didn't know you two had something going on..."

"It's not like that. You're overthinking..." Simon hurriedly explained, "If Kathy finds out, she'll scold me."

I laughed, "Don't worry. I won't tell her until you're sure of your feelings."

"Good..." Simon left after our conversation.

But I couldn't calm down. Simon and Kathy were both good friends. If they got together, it would be great. But after everything that had happened, I felt things weren't that simple.

Still, I trusted Simon.

That evening, I was still thinking about the day's events when I got home. The more I thought, the more I couldn't find a solution, especially for the task Royce had given me. How could we get Joanna to do the test or get a blood sample smoothly?

I sighed deeply and called Kathy.

Surprisingly, she was still awake, "Why are you calling me so late?"

"You're still up? I need to discuss something with you."

Kathy guessed it was about Joanna, "Are you still thinking about the test?"

"You know... you're better at this than I am. I can't come up with a plan."

Kathy quickly said, "I've been thinking about it too. I have a plan now..."

"Tell me."

"Joanna recently opened a new spa. We can go there for a spa day and chat with her... then trick her into going to the hospital for a check-up."

I said, "We just need a blood sample..."

"Are you crazy? Joanna's too smart for that. You think you can leave a needle mark on her?"

Kathy's teasing made me laugh, "You're right. I was oversimplifying it."

"Tomorrow, you set up the appointment with her. We'll bring Isadora along."

###chapter 276

Talking about Isadora, I actually wanted to include her too.

After all, Isadora first reached out to Simon through Joanna, and over time, we all became good friends.

But since Isadora just had a baby, she probably can't join us for a spa day.

With that in mind, I shared my thoughts and concerns with Kathy.

Kathy seemed to just realize it: "You're right. I was just thinking about how fun it would be for all of us to get together, and it might make it easier for Joanna to open up."

Although we all hope Joanna is okay, if something really is wrong...

I sighed, "Kathy, what should we do if something's really wrong with Joanna?"

Kathy, being more carefree than me, replied, "What else can we do?"

"Besides getting ourselves checked and supporting Joanna through her treatment, there's not much we can do."

Even though she said that, I still felt uneasy after hanging up the phone.

Kelly noticed something was off and brought me a warm glass of milk to my study that evening. "Caroline, why are you working late recently?"

I wasn't really working late, just handling some contract stuff.

Clementine was still on leave, otherwise, I wouldn't be rushing to handle Asher's contract.

Thinking about it, I noted something down in my phone's memo.

The next morning, I went to see Kathy.

To my surprise, I saw Simon at the entrance of her new studio.

They were talking at the door, and they looked quite good together.

One was a beautiful woman in a stylish outfit, the other a detective in a black trench coat.

Standing aside, I couldn't help but smile at how good they looked together.

Kathy noticed me and waved, "Why are you just standing there watching us?"

Simon greeted me too, but I felt something was off with him today. "What's up?"

"Nothing, just discussing something with Kathy," Simon said with a smile.

I still felt they were hiding something from me and instinctively said, "If I'm interrupting, I can leave."

"Don't be like that," Kathy laughed. "Simon was just helping arrange something for Joanna. But lately, Joanna's schedule is fixed, and she has almost no social life. He's worried that anything he does will seem too deliberate."

No social life? So Joanna's been at home all this time?

Kathy, knowing what I was thinking, quickly added, "Don't worry, she's fine. Ronnie's been really busy lately. Joanna's father assigned him a new project, and he's swamped."

She lowered her voice, "I heard Maeve and Ronnie haven't seen each other in days, so you can imagine."

I sighed, "Ronnie's affair is actually a way to gauge how busy he is."

Simon, listening to our conversation, chimed in, "It's up to you guys now. I helped Joanna before, and if I try to get close to her again, she'll definitely notice."

Given Joanna's special status, it was tricky to arrange things, so it was up to us, her close friends.

Kathy and I exchanged a glance, "Alright, let's stick to our original plan and find an opportunity during the spa day."

But since Joanna owns the spa, bribing the staff won't be easy. We'll have to see how things go.

Thinking about this, I knew we'd still need Simon's help, so I took out my phone to transfer him some money.

"We'll definitely need your help this time too. Let me pay you in advance."

Simon waved it off, "No need this time. We're all friends, and I offered to help."

"Didn't you say you were out of work recently?" I frowned.

Simon chuckled, "That was a joke. I worked hard before and saved up a bit. I won't starve anytime soon."

After Simon chatted with us a bit more and left, I watched his back and suddenly remembered the gossip he shared about Kathy last time.

Thinking about seeing them talking alone today, I nudged Kathy with my elbow, "What's going on with you and him?"

"Me and who?" Kathy hadn't caught on.

I pointed with my lips, "You and Simon."

Maybe because I was so worried about Joanna, gossiping about my two friends cheered me up a bit.

Kathy's eyes widened, "Seriously, Caroline? I know you're anxious about Joanna, but why would you think there's something between me and Simon?"

"He's two years younger than me. I wouldn't consider it."

Kathy spoke with a dismissive tone.

"Besides, I only see him as a very capable friend. There's no way we could be more than that."

I knew Kathy would say that, so I laughed and linked arms with her as we walked inside, "Alright, let's go in and talk."

Standing at the door, people might think we weren't allowed in.

Once we were in Kathy's office, she had her assistant bring me some water and brought up the earlier topic.

"Don't spread rumors. Simon and I are really just close friends."

I nodded, "Got it, got it. I was just in the mood for some gossip today. Don't mind me."

Kathy snorted, "If I don't clear things up, you'll keep thinking there's something between us."

"Just focus on keeping Royce happy. Don't worry about me and Simon."

Thinking of Royce made my cheeks warm, "He's just being clingy around me lately."

When I first reunited with Royce, he wasn't like this.

Back then, when I returned home with my child and ran into him, he was still his usual cool and dignified self.

Though he was particularly attentive to my matters, I was preoccupied with dealing with Brandon, so I didn't think much about Royce's feelings at the time.

Everything had signs, but I only realized it later.

"I know you two were classmates, but isn't it nice that he's so gentle with you now, Caroline?"

Kathy reminisced, "No matter what, you and Royce are like a broken mirror mended, right?"

Are we?

I'm not really sure.

Back in school, we never even had a proper confession.

Who knew that after everything I've been through, we'd end up together again?

Thinking about it made me a bit dazed, so I quickly changed the subject, "By the way, did you handle that thing with Yvonne?"

Recently, Kathy wanted to advance in styling and started learning makeup, which is why she added that module to her studio's services.

"Yvonne? That bitch."

###chapter 277

Kathy had a dismissive look on her face. "I already confronted her. Told her if she tries anything again, I'll blast her online."

Considering Kathy's current influence with her studio, exposing Yvonne online would definitely be a big deal.

I stuck out my tongue playfully. "Kathy, you're awesome."

"What's the big deal? I just can't stand her."

Hearing Kathy's words, I couldn't help but laugh out loud.

Kathy's fiery personality hadn't dimmed one bit over the years.

"I know Royce has warned her too. If she causes any more trouble, let me know," I said seriously to Kathy.

Kathy waved her hand dismissively. "Forget it. You're too soft-hearted. It doesn't bother me much. After all, she has to pay a cancellation fee, so she's the one losing out. This whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not planning to do any more makeup gigs for now."

"Better to leave it to the professionals. I need to focus on designing for the new season."

I smiled. "Alright, I'll look forward to your new collection."

"But Caroline, honestly, you should make more of an effort with Royce. This is a perfect opportunity to strengthen your relationship. Just be a little more affectionate with him."

"Why would I need to be more affectionate? We're not even officially together yet."

We chatted and laughed, completely forgetting about the dark cloud that had been hanging over us.

Kathy had always been good to me. I spent half the day at her studio, and she even took my measurements, saying she wanted to make me a custom outfit.

"Why the sudden urge to make me clothes?" I let her take my measurements, curious about her sudden inspiration.

"You inspired me, Caroline. I realized that people can be beautiful at any age and stage of life. Despite everything you've been through, you're still gorgeous."

Kathy said this while measuring my waist with a soft tape. She added, "Next time, give me Mrs. Sharp's measurements too. I'll design a mother-daughter outfit for you both."

"That sounds great," I said with a smile. "My mom will be thrilled."

Leaving Kathy's studio, I felt much better.

We had originally met to discuss Joanna, but we ended up talking about so many other things.

Meeting with friends always helps to lift the spirits.

On my way back, I got a call from Asher.

"Hey, Asher."

I thought it might be something about the company contract, so I spoke more seriously.

"Caroline, I called to let you know that the contracts you prepared for us have been approved."

"That's fantastic." I couldn't help but feel excited.

"But this is just the beginning. You all need to perform well."

This project was crucial for Asher's company to establish itself.

If it went well, I would use all my resources to support him.

But given the previous social media scandal, if Asher's team messed up, there wouldn't be much I could do.

Asher quickly said, "Of course. But I also wanted to ask when you're free in the next few days. I'd like to take you out for a meal."

"And bring along the assistant who helped you."

I thought about it. Now that the project was confirmed, having a meal with Asher wouldn't cause any issues.

"Sure. I should be free the next few days. Just send me the time and place, and I'll bring my assistant."

"I'll book a private room. You all can eat and drink to your heart's content."

After hanging up, I felt even better.

Everything seemed to be slowly improving, except for the issue with Joanna.

Thinking about it made me frown slightly.

Just then, I remembered something and pulled out my phone to check my previous chat with Simon.

When Alfonso had threatened me using the kids, Simon and Royce had helped me gather a lot of information.

I suddenly wondered if Maeve, who seemed to have a powerful backer, might be connected to Alfonso in some way.

Or perhaps Maeve knew something about Alfonso?

It was strange. When Maeve first appeared in my life, I felt nothing but disdain for her. Even when we met, I was impatient with her.

But now, thinking about the secrets and clues she might hold, I wanted to meet and talk with her more.

Without wasting any time, I found Maeve on WhatsApp.

[Maeve, how much do you know about Alfonso?]

Maeve seemed to be away, as she didn't reply until an hour later.

[Are you investigating Joanna now?]

[I'm not investigating Joanna. Alfonso has been causing trouble for my company recently, and I just wanted to ask.]

Maeve took a while to reply again.

While waiting, I got home and went straight to the kids' room to check on them.

Brett had already been picked up by Kelly. When he saw me, he ran over immediately. "Mom! You're home early today!"

"If I knew I'd be home before you, I would've picked you up myself." I pinched Brett's cheek.

Our cat, Nala, circled around my legs, her fluffy tail brushing against my calf.

"It's okay. Grandma picked me up, and my classmates all like her."

Brett said loudly.

I laughed. "If I picked you up, would your classmates like me too?"

"Of course! They'd definitely say my mom is young and beautiful." Brett lifted his chin proudly.

I laughed and patted Brett's head. "How's the new nanny? Is her cooking good?"

The previous nanny, Holly, had to leave due to family issues.

Kelly had said she could handle three kids just fine, but then I brought home another child.

With four kids now, Kelly was understandably exhausted, so I hired a new nanny with several years of childcare experience.

Brett nodded. "Zola's cooking is delicious! Grandma also says she's very efficient. When Grandma picks me up, Zola is busy at home."

"That's good."

As long as things at home were running smoothly, I could focus on other matters.

Kelly came over a bit later, hearing us talk. She smiled and took my hand. "Don't worry about the house. With me taking care of the four kids and Zola helping, everything's fine."

"Mom... thank you. I'll try to retire early." I couldn't help but act a little spoiled with Kelly.

Kelly shook her head. "Don't rush. The company was your dad's legacy. Just keep working hard."

###chapter 278

Kelly sighed and suddenly brought up something to me.

"Hey, I had a dream about him a while ago. He said you're still young and should focus on your career."

My heart ached a little.

When Gerald was alive, he was a smart and visionary guy. Otherwise, he wouldn't have bought so many properties and started his own business.

"Dad's definitely watching me run the company from up there... I'll head to the study and work late tonight. I can't let him down."

I said with a smile.

"You don't have to push yourself so hard. You're more important than the company. I know your dad."

Kelly pulled me into the kitchen to check out what delicious food Zola had made for dinner.

While waiting for dinner in the living room, Brett took out his homework and started working on it at the table, while I occasionally glanced at the TV.

Maeve finally replied to my message, but she didn't mention anything about Alfonso. She just reminded me again not to leak any information to Joanna.

[If you really want to investigate Alfonso, wait until I'm sure Joanna won't divorce Ronnie. I'll help you ask around.]

Help me?

Maeve's tone made me a bit puzzled.

Is she working so hard to build a relationship with me just to prevent Joanna and Ronnie from divorcing?

Does this mean she never intended to take Joanna's place?

I'm starting to think that everything might be just as Royce said, that Maeve is merely a tool for bribery.

So, for her, the person giving her orders is probably more important than Ronnie!

I forwarded the message to Royce.

Royce first replied with a question mark, then asked why I was still in contact with Maeve on WhatsApp.

I told him the truth, saying I wanted to get more information.

Royce quickly replied.

[Ronnie's status isn't that of an ordinary person. If Maeve has no ulterior motives, it only means the person behind her is much higher in status than Ronnie.]

I thought the same, so I asked Royce what we should do.

[That person is not to be messed with. Have Simon check Maeve's whereabouts and see if there are any clues.]

Things seemed to be at a standstill, slowly moving forward.

Just as I started to zone out, Royce's message popped up on the screen again.

[But no matter what, I'm here. Don't worry.]

That message made my heart settle.

I knew he would keep his word.

"Dinner's ready..."

Zola called out, and I put down my phone, pulling Brett to the table.

These past few days have been busy. Although nothing particularly significant happened, I was exhausted.

Only when I'm at home, surrounded by family, do I feel at ease.

The investigation into Maeve had stalled, but Kathy and I weren't idle.

A couple of days later, we informed Isadora of our plans.

Isadora expressed her regret.

"My husband is really worried about me and doesn't want me to leave the maternity center. Honestly, I'm bored to death here..."

Listening to Isadora's sweet complaints, Kathy and I exchanged glances.

"Don't make us jealous. Marshall is handsome and reliable, and your baby is so adorable."

Kathy gently teased the baby in the swaddle.

Isadora laughed, "I'm not trying to make you jealous. I'm genuinely frustrated! You guys are going to the spa, and I can't even go."

"There will be plenty of chances in the future. Just focus on getting better for now, and we'll have fun together later."

We talked to Isadora in advance to avoid any misunderstandings.

Joanna's situation had been a wake-up call for me.

No matter how busy I am, I should keep in touch with my friends. I managed to escape from Brandon's family's clutches thanks to these people.

After leaving the maternity center, Kathy and I headed straight to Joanna's new spa.

The new place was called "Tranquil Oasis Spa," featuring a new style with a serene environment.

As soon as we entered, we saw bamboo partitions and heard the sound of flowing water, which instantly made us feel relaxed.

Kathy and I suddenly felt less nervous, even though we knew today's conversation was important.

Joanna was in the lobby talking to an employee, seemingly discussing the spa's recent operations. The employee looked diligent and respectful while speaking with Joanna.

Kathy and I watched from the side, whispering, "Look, this is how Joanna usually does business. She's so serious."

"Keep your voice down. She'll probably have something to say to us when she comes over."

Our presence indeed caught Joanna's attention.

She turned to us, surprised, "Why didn't you call me when you arrived?"

"We saw you were busy, so we thought we'd wait over here," Kathy and I exchanged a glance.

Joanna laughed, "You guys are my friends. There's no need to wait. Come on, I've reserved the SVIP room for us to enjoy."

We then realized that after we mentioned the idea to Joanna, she had already booked the room.

"Isn't this room expensive? Won't it affect your earnings?" Kathy and I were taken aback, "How about we pay the member price?"

"Pay what? Do I look like I need your money?" Joanna pretended to glare at us, "Besides, I can't spend the money I have."

Her dad is a government official, and if their family lived extravagantly, it would easily attract criticism.

Joanna had mentioned this to me before, saying that her family had to be cautious even though she had her own business.

I thought, having money and power can be exhausting too.

"Today, we visited Isadora at the maternity center. She said she wanted to come, but Marshall is strict, so maybe next time."

As we followed Joanna upstairs to a private room, Kathy mentioned today's events.

Three attendants followed us, ready to serve us. They were young, polite, and helped us change clothes and get massages.

The three of us lay on three beds and started chatting.

When Joanna heard about Isadora, she couldn't help but show her envy, "Marshall is really good to her. It's hard not to be jealous."

"That's true... Marshall is a cop, and he's clean. Except for the danger of his job, there's nothing to complain about." Kathy sighed.

When it came to getting Joanna to open up, Kathy was much more natural than I was.

No wonder she could act and deceive Brandon in front of me back then.

It seemed that being in her own place today, Joanna was more open than last time, "If I could do it all over again, I'd want a marriage like Isadora's."

My heart tightened, "Is Ronnie not good to you?"

"Him?" Joanna sighed and suddenly fell silent.

Kathy and I exchanged a secret glance.

"What's wrong, Joanna? You can tell us anything." Kathy took the initiative to speak.

###chapter 279

A silence settled between us.

Kathy didn't seem to mind, lying there and chatting with the waiter about her sore shoulder, asking him to press harder.

I picked up the conversation and said to Joanna, "What's up? Spill it."

Our questions seemed to have moved Joanna.

She sighed softly, "It's not that he's bad to me... but it feels like there's no spark anymore. Neither of us really cares about what the other is doing."

"After our last talk, I went home and tentatively asked my parents what they would think if I got a divorce."

Joanna had always been a bit rebellious since she was a kid. But because of her family's constraints, she had always walked the straight and narrow, never doing anything too outrageous.

However, you could often see that rebellious streak in her.

For instance, back then, because she hated mistresses, she helped me with so many things.

In my heart, Joanna was a bit of a chivalrous woman.

"Anyway, I know it would be really hard for me to get a divorce. Unless Ronnie did something really bad, but our issues haven't reached that level. In short, it's very difficult right now."

As Joanna spoke, she suddenly called over the waiter.

"Where's the wine I prepared? Go get it for me."

She smiled at us, "Last time we met for dinner, we didn't drink much. Today, we should drink to our hearts' content."

"This wine, I had someone bring it back from outside. It's really fragrant."

Kathy and I sat up, "So you planned a drinking session for us today? We thought we were just here for facials."

Joanna laughed heartily, "You guys aren't leaving until we're all drunk!"

She didn't bring up the previous topic again.

But thinking about her family's attitude, I could understand.

Joanna's father was a prominent figure. Joanna's wedding had been a grand affair, and Ronnie was doing quite well for himself. It would be embarrassing for anyone if something happened now.

As I was lost in thought, Joanna let out a yelp.

The wine was sealed in a ceramic jar, and she accidentally cut her finger while opening it with a knife!

I quickly grabbed some tissues to wipe her hand and asked the waiter to get a first aid kit.

But then, an idea struck me.

Didn't Royce say it would be best to get Joanna to do a check-up or get a blood sample?

Wasn't this the perfect opportunity?

Even though I was a bit nervous, I quickly used the spatula from the face mask set to collect a bit of her blood while she wasn't paying attention.

Kathy noticed my actions and reacted quickly, taking a small bag from the first aid kit and hurriedly putting the blood sample inside.

We managed to collect the blood sample right under Joanna's nose.

"I need to take a call..."

Kathy left with the blood sample, leaving me to tend to Joanna's wound.

I knew she was probably going to find Simon.

On our way here, Kathy and I had contacted Simon, saying we would play it by ear.

Originally, we planned to talk about recent health issues during the spa session and then take Joanna to a therapy center we had arranged, where we would switch things up and get her checked.

But now, we had an unexpected opportunity.

My heart was still racing when Kathy returned.

Kathy shook her hands and wiped them with a disinfectant wipe, giving me a knowing look.

"Alright, I'm going to wash my hands too."

We weren't sure if Joanna was in trouble, so we couldn't let our guard down.

While treating her wound, I was careful not to touch her blood.

It was only when I washed my hands in the spa's restroom that my heartbeat finally slowed down.

It was almost too easy.

And Joanna, being so smart, didn't seem to notice anything, which meant Kathy and I had done a good job.

A message from Simon popped up on my phone.

[You two were quick. The blood sample is still good. I've already sent it to the hospital.]

He was fast!

Feeling relieved, I quickly reported the good news to Royce.

Royce praised our quick thinking and said he would contact Simon to keep an eye on the test results.

With that, we made some progress on Joanna's situation.

Kathy and I relaxed, enjoying the rest of the drinking session and chatting with Joanna.

After a few drinks, Joanna opened up more.

"Let's just take it one day at a time... I'm busy with my store now, and honestly, I don't want to dwell on those things for now."

The wine she brought was indeed delicious.

Before we knew it, Kathy and I were a bit tipsy and decided to stay the night.

The day passed quickly. Joanna got up to talk to her staff, and Kathy and I huddled together, still a bit drunk.

Just then, my phone rang.

Royce was calling, asking me to step outside.

Now?

I was still in my spa clothes, but I wondered if he had something important to tell me.

Luckily, I had worn a coat today. I threw it on and stepped out.

Royce was leaning against the hallway wall.

"What are you doing here?"

The spa's target clientele was women, so he seemed out of place.

Maybe that's why Royce kept his eyes down, trying not to look around.

"Look up. This floor is for SVIP members. It's just us today."

I pulled my coat tighter.

But the spa had heating, and it was warm inside, so I loosened my coat a bit.

The spa clothes were thin, and Royce glanced at me, his ears turning red.

At first, I didn't notice and asked why he was here. It wasn't until I saw his shifty gaze that I looked down at myself.

The outfit was quite revealing, meant for massages...

I blushed, "Don't look."

"Sorry, couldn't help it," Royce replied quickly.

I was a bit annoyed, "Then try harder!"

Royce suddenly stepped forward and kissed my cheek.

"Just had a facial? Your skin feels great."

After the brief kiss, he said that to me.

I could feel my face getting even hotter...

Sneaking a glance at Royce, I saw he was wearing a coat too.

A black coat, gray shirt, and matching suit pants. He wore custom-made shoes and looked incredibly handsome.

In that moment, I suddenly understood why Yvonne was so obsessed with him.

Maybe I had liked Royce just as much back then.

"What are you thinking about?" Royce tapped my nose.

I shook my head, "Nothing."

"Are you not going home tonight? I came to take you out for dinner."

"I'm not going back. Kathy and I are going to chat more with Joanna."

Thinking of this, I quickly asked, "By the way, what about the test results with Simon? It's been a day."

###chapter 280

This whole situation feels like a nightmare, haunting me deep inside.

Ever since I found out Joanna might have been exposed to the virus, I haven't had a good night's sleep. Only when I'm with friends can I momentarily forget about it.

Royce, hearing my concerns, glanced around.

Luckily, there was no one nearby.

This floor was always quiet, and the waitstaff rarely came by to disturb us.

"Are you sure you want to talk about this here?" Royce asked, winking at me.

That little gesture made him seem so lively, a stark contrast to his usual domineering demeanor.

I couldn't help but chuckle. "Where else? Just give me some good news already."

I had finally managed to get a sample of Joanna's blood for testing today. If there were no results yet, I would go crazy with worry.

Royce raised his hand and gently patted my head.

His touch was so tender, the warmth of his palm on my head made my heart soften.

There was a strange feeling that made me look up at Royce.

When our eyes met, I could see the gentleness and affection in his gaze.

It had been a long time since I felt this way...

I blinked. "Is the news bad? Why aren't you saying anything?"

"I just thought it was rare for us to be alone somewhere else. I wanted to savor the moment," Royce said.

His words made me blush.

Feeling the heat in my ears, I touched them. "We don't spend much time together?"

Just a few days ago, Royce had chased me to my house and talked to me at the door.

How could he forget so quickly?

Royce laughed. "Caroline, have you ever thought that when we're together, I always feel like there's never enough time?"

"We're not even officially together" I blurted out instinctively.

Realizing what I had said, I understood he was talking about our time spent together, not our relationship status.

I blushed again and lowered my head, avoiding his gaze.

Royce seemed amused by my shyness and stepped closer. "Caroline, when will you finally let me be your official boyfriend?"

There was a hint of a sigh in his voice.

I wasn't sure if he was too eager.

"Why do you keep changing the subject? Is there really something wrong with Joanna?" I couldn't help but shift my focus.

I hadn't been so suspicious before, but Royce's evasiveness made me worry.

Seeing my serious expression, Royce sighed. "Joanna is fine."

I couldn't believe it. "Really?"

"Of course. I wouldn't lie to you about something this important."

Royce was right. No matter how many misunderstandings or arguments we had, he never kept crucial information from me.

He always tried to keep me informed.

I almost cried with relief.

My body reacted before I could, and my nose tingled.

"That's such a relief... You have no idea how worried I've been these past few days."

Even though Joanna had told me she and Ronnie hadn't been intimate for a long time, I still couldn't be sure.

What if they had been, and she was just too embarrassed to tell me?

And Maeve and Ronnie had definitely been together.

Two adults, one of them married, meeting at a hotel-what else could they be doing?

Thinking about it made me curse Ronnie. "Is cheating something men are just born to do?"

My words made Royce frown slightly.

"Caroline, every time you say that, I can assure you I'm not like that. But I know each time you say it, your trust in men diminishes a little."

"I just want you to know I'll do everything I can to prove I'm different."

Royce held my hand, squeezing my palm. "I hope you'll trust me more in the future."

I shook my head and quickly explained, "It's not that I don't trust you... It's just that so much has happened, I don't know what to believe anymore."

I did rely on Royce, and I hoped he could heal all my wounds and bring me true happiness.

But these feelings were selfish, and I didn't dare share them with Royce.

Royce looked at me intently. "Caroline, do you feel more at ease now?"

I realized he was talking about Joanna, so I nodded. "Thanks to you and Simon."

"Simon did a lot. He took the blood sample to the hospital for testing as soon as you messaged me."

Royce smiled. "When you texted me, he was already waiting in the lab."

"He's really fast." Otherwise, Kathy wouldn't have hired him as a private investigator to help me.

I couldn't help but mutter, "I wonder where Kathy found such a capable person."

"Am I not capable enough for you?" Royce seemed jealous all the time.

I sighed. "Why are you even jealous of Simon? You're not a private investigator."

"But in helping you, I feel like one," Royce said with a smile.

I sighed. "True."

We talked for a long time at the door.

Until Kathy came out looking for me. "Caroline, what's going on? Weren't we supposed to chat inside?"

She noticed Royce standing next to me and stuck out her tongue, giving us a knowing look.

"So, the lovebirds are having a secret meeting! I'll leave you two to it..."

I quickly grabbed Kathy's arm. "I should go back too..."

The heating was too high, and I had rushed out to see Royce with an extra coat on. Now I was too hot.

Royce had been here for a while, and he probably had things to do. I wanted him to go back too.

"You should head back. You'll have to work late again."

Royce checked his watch. "I was just about to leave."

He glanced at Kathy. "Please make sure she gets home safely tomorrow."

"Of course, Mr. Castillo. Caroline is a princess who needs protection, right?"

###chapter 281

Kathy was dragging out her words, joking right in front of us.

Royce gave a helpless smile but nodded at Kathy's comment. "Yeah, she's still a kid at heart."

After saying that, Royce gave me a long look before walking away.

I was still in a daze even after Royce's figure disappeared from sight.

Did they just call me a kid right in front of me?

I've already had four kids and been through a marriage, yet they still see me as a child.

Kathy waved her hand in front of my face. "What's up, Caroline? Don't tell me Royce's words got you all flustered."

I snapped out of it and playfully pushed Kathy.

I had to admit, getting a spa treatment really helped us relax.

Kathy was glowing now too.

I touched her face. "Don't you think your skin feels so much better after the facial?"

Kathy nodded, her eyes lighting up. "You noticed it too, right?"

She grabbed my hand and started walking back. "I've decided, we should get a membership here at Joanna's spa. We can come here to relax and get treatments whenever we want."

"Are you kidding? We already have top-tier VIP cards here."

I had to say, Joanna was really generous with her friends.

Not long after we met, she had her assistant send us beauty cards.

The cards were permanent and unlimited.

The assistant even told us that Joanna had these cards specially made for us, and no one else could use them even if they found them.

When we first received such a valuable gift, Kathy and I were stunned.

Thinking about it, I couldn't help but say, "Thank goodness Joanna's okay... I would be devastated if such a good friend got hurt."

Kathy's eyes widened. "The test results are out?"

She whispered this almost directly into my ear.

I nodded, remembering what Royce had told me earlier. I quickly recounted our conversation to Kathy, focusing on the part about Joanna.

Besides Joanna being okay, Royce had also shared some intel with me.

"And ever since I found out about this, I've had Royce keep an eye on Ronnie."

I glanced around as I spoke quietly to Kathy.

Honestly, when Royce first told me, I didn't think it was a big deal. But now, talking to Kathy, it seemed more significant. "You know, Ronnie has landed several big deals in the past year and has been moving up the ranks."

Kathy scoffed. "What's so special about that? He's always been capable and knows how to work the system. Plus, after marrying Joanna, with Oscar's influence, it's no surprise he'd get a boost."

We never had a great impression of Ronnie.

We heard that in the first year of his marriage to Joanna, Oscar had already given him many benefits, but he still wasn't satisfied and kept pushing Joanna to ask Oscar for more help.

Of course, we only learned about this later from Joanna herself, after we became closer friends with her.

I told Kathy, "My initial reaction was the same as yours, but think about it. For him to achieve so much in just a year, someone must be giving him a significant push."

Given his usual personality and abilities, this shouldn't be normal.

"But he was stuck at the same level for years, no matter how much Joanna's family helped him."

Kathy finally understood what I was getting at.

She turned to me, shocked. "You mean, Ronnie's rise is because of his connection with Maeve, and her network helped him?"

Kathy suddenly covered her mouth.

I was about to say more when the door opened, and Joanna walked in.

"What are you two whispering about out here? If I hadn't heard your voices and asked him to open the door, I wouldn't have known you were back."

It seemed Joanna hadn't heard our conversation.

Kathy and I exchanged a glance and walked inside without saying anything.

Kathy stretched. "Nothing much, just Caroline's sweet boyfriend came to see her... I happened to be looking for someone and saw him! We just chatted for a bit. I was teasing Caroline about it. Even during a spa day, Royce couldn't stay away and had to come check on her."

She gave Joanna a mischievous smile.

"But Joanna, I have to say, after seeing Royce today, I think we need to change our impression of him... He seemed a bit serious in front of Caroline today, not just the overly gentle guy we thought he was."

I followed Kathy's lead. "Royce isn't just a gentle guy. I'm surprised you all think that. He just acts cute around me, but he's always been reliable when it comes to important matters."

Joanna looked at us and laughed. "True... Without Royce's help, Caroline wouldn't have had such a smooth divorce. We owe him a lot."

I laughed and grabbed Joanna's hand. "Exactly, Joanna, you hit the nail on the head."

Kathy pouted. "Maybe that's just the charm of a couple."

Joanna added, "But he really is gentle with you. We're just joking around, we don't have any issues with him. At our age, we should be looking for someone like that."

"Our age... We're not that old." Kathy was the first to object.

Joanna sighed.

"How are we not? But we do know how to take care of ourselves, so we have an advantage."

"You have no idea how many young girls come to my spa every year for beauty treatments. I never had that awareness when I was young."

I lay down, letting the attendant give me a comfortable massage. "Stop it, Joanna. You've always had a good life, and you don't look a day over thirty. If anyone's old, it's me, with all the stress I've been through."

And just like that, the topic was dropped.

###chapter 282

The waiter kept giving us massages while I stared up at the skylight, watching the night slowly take over.

After a while, Kathy suddenly remembered something and started chatting with Joanna.

"Joanna, you never told us how you and Ronnie met. Was he as persistent as Royce was with Caroline?"

I was about to say something when Kathy glanced at me with a knowing look.

It was clear she wasn't just gossiping. She wanted to understand the current state of Joanna and Ronnie's relationship. If they had a strong, loving relationship, we needed to think carefully about how to advise Joanna on her divorce.

Joanna didn't respond immediately. After a moment, her phone rang.

Kathy and I watched as Joanna waved her phone at us. "I need to take this call. It's Ronnie."

Ronnie?

As Joanna stepped away to take the call, Kathy and I huddled together, whispering.

Joanna didn't go far, and we could hear snippets of her conversation.

"I understand. I'll handle it..."

"But you need to take care of yourself. Don't overwork."

"I'll talk to Dad. Just make sure you know what you're doing."

Kathy and I were confused but managed to piece together that Ronnie wanted Joanna to talk to Oscar about something.

Kathy pulled out her phone to message Simon. "I'll ask him about the details of the results."

I nodded. "Make sure there's no misunderstanding. If we get this wrong, all our plans are wasted."

After a while, Joanna returned and took a sip of water before speaking. "If you want to know, I need to gather my thoughts..."

We had all had a bit to drink, and our voices were starting to slur.

Joanna had drunk the most and still had a bandage on her finger from when Kathy had patched her up earlier.

"Our story isn't exactly a fairytale... It's a bit embarrassing, actually."

Kathy and I sat cross-legged, listening intently.

The waiter had left, and it was just the three of us in the large room.

Kathy and I flanked Joanna, eager to hear her story.

"Well, it all started..."

Joanna paused and looked at us.

"What's wrong? Keep going," Kathy and I urged her.

Joanna laughed. "You two are making me feel like I'm at a storytelling event. It's a bit nerve-wracking."

I waved my hand dismissively. "We've been curious about your story for ages. You've been married for so long and seem so stable. We're just envious."

I studied Joanna. She was about my age, maybe a year older. Slim and elegant, she had a refined air about her, clearly from a well-off family.

When I first met her, she had short hair. Now it was mid-length, naturally draped over her shoulders. She had never dyed it, keeping a low profile due to her family's profession.

As she answered our questions, she frowned slightly but smiled. She was beautiful.

I couldn't help but think that if I compared Joanna to Maeve, Joanna was definitely more beautiful. But Maeve had a certain allure that men found irresistible-seductive and charming.

Joanna was too normal, always principled. I couldn't imagine how she and Ronnie interacted privately, but any man would be tempted by someone like Maeve.

Brandon had proven that.

And if Royce was right, Maeve was being used as a pawn in some larger scheme, trained to seduce men.

Her Facebook profile said it all.

As I pondered Maeve, Joanna spoke up. "We didn't fall in love and then get married."

"Our story is more like Caroline and Brandon's. He was just a poor college student when we met."

Kathy rolled her eyes. "Don't compare everything to Brandon! He's a jerk. Anyone is better than him."

"Exactly..." I agreed outwardly, but knowing Ronnie had cheated made me feel bitter.

We could comfort Joanna, but knowing the truth would devastate her.

Joanna continued, "I met him just before I graduated. He was a year ahead, in grad school. I remember running into him in the office while handling graduation paperwork. He was talking to a professor about not being able to pay his tuition..."

Over time, Joanna and Ronnie grew closer. She learned he worked multiple jobs to support himself and came from a poor family.

But Joanna didn't mind. She was drawn to him, not out of love, but because she wanted to help him.

"I introduced Ronnie to my father as someone I was sponsoring. But later, he talked to my dad alone."

"That's when I found out he wanted to marry me."

Kathy and I exchanged glances, thinking this was another story of a poor student taking advantage of a benefactor.

Ronnie had betrayed his benefactor!

But his comeuppance would come later...

Joanna had no idea how much pain awaited her.

###chapter 283

"So, you two just ended up together like that?"

Joanna nodded. "Pretty much. My parents were thrilled with him back then. They said he seemed decent and hardworking."

"Even though you two weren't exactly a perfect match, at least they knew him well."

Knew him well.

I almost wanted to scoff at the thought of using that phrase to describe Ronnie.

You can know someone's face but not their heart.

Kathy seemed to be thinking the same thing and let out a sigh.

"What's wrong? Why did you both go silent? Do you think my marriage started off too haphazardly?"

Joanna sighed and lay back on the bed.

"I never really dated much growing up. My family was super strict. So when he said he wanted to marry me, I was a bit stunned. I thought I had found someone who genuinely liked me. Plus, despite his humble background, he overcame his insecurities and told my dad he wanted to marry me. I thought he was the one."

As she spoke, Joanna closed her eyes.

It seemed like she had more to say but didn't.

But Kathy and I could probably guess.

Maybe after getting married, Joanna realized Ronnie was more interested in her family's wealth and Oscar's influence.

We all fell silent and lay back on the beds.

It had been a long time since I had talked so much with friends, feeling like we were back in high school, chatting in our dorms.

But soon, my phone rang.

I reached for it to check the message.

Kathy heard it and immediately teased, "Is it him again? You two are so clingy, anyone would think you just got married."

I glared at Kathy. "Can you stop joking about us? We're not even officially together yet. If it doesn't work out, you'll be teasing me about it forever."

Joanna laughed. "So when are you going to say yes? He seems really into you. Don't let a guy like that slip away."

I said, "I haven't decided yet. I need more time to think..."

"He's been sending me flowers every day, but I've been so busy, I'm hardly ever at the office. At least wait until I can see the flowers every day at work... maybe in a month."

Joanna clapped her hands. "That's so sweet. You two sound so happy."

I smiled and glanced at my phone, but my heart skipped a beat when I saw Maeve's name on the screen.

I quickly looked around.

Joanna was talking to Kathy and didn't notice me.

I sighed in relief and turned my phone slightly to see what Maeve had sent.

This time, Maeve didn't send a voice message but two texts.

[Caroline, when are you free? I have something to discuss with you.]

[Let me know when you're available. I'll arrange a place for us to meet.]

Maeve's tone was almost commanding.

I frowned, wanting to tell Maeve I was busy and wouldn't be free for the next few days.

After all, Joanna's situation had just been resolved, and Kathy and I were still figuring out how to convince her to get a divorce!

Now Maeve's message had come through, and for some reason, I felt very annoyed.

I remembered the last time I saw her talking to Royce in the café.

Maeve had too many secrets.

She might even be dangerous.

Initially, I met with her to get some clues.

But now, I didn't want to get close to her at all.

The last conversation didn't benefit me at all. Maeve didn't share any information and only made demands.

I angrily replied.

[You said the same thing last time, but you didn't tell me anything. You just made demands. Our deal is unfair.]

Maeve quickly replied.

[This time is different. There's something I must tell you.]

[If this changes your mind, Brandon has been released.]

Brandon?

I almost shouted when I saw the name.

I sat up, staring at my phone in disbelief.

Joanna and Kathy, who were talking, saw me and quickly asked what was wrong.

I couldn't care less that Maeve had told me this. With a trembling voice, I said, "Brandon has been released!"

I wasn't sure what was going on, but they needed to know.

Joanna and Kathy were shocked. "How is that possible? Wasn't he sent to the police station last time?"

I nodded. "Yes, he was at our house, and we reported him for theft. The evidence was clear, and he should have been locked up for a while..."

I calculated the time. He had been in custody for about two weeks.

Maybe because so much had happened, time flew by, and I hadn't realized it had been that long...

Thinking about it made me feel down. "So much has happened, I forgot about this. I should have provided more evidence to keep him locked up for years."

"It's not your fault. The police have procedures to follow. If you report it again after the divorce, they'll have to reopen the case."

Kathy patted my shoulder.

But this news had already ruined my mood.

The only good news today was that Joanna was okay.

We spent the night at Joanna's spa, and I felt a bit better the next morning.

When I got home, I quickly told Simon about it and asked him to find out why Brandon was released.

Logically, with a pending lawsuit, this shouldn't happen.

Unless someone was helping him!

And the fact that Maeve told me this made me suspicious. Were they all part of a plan?

Or was there a bigger scheme that I had never truly escaped from?

Thinking about this, I stared blankly at the crib.

Our cat, Nala, jumped up and cuddled next to me.

"Nala, I wish you could talk."

As a cat, she could be a witness.

But that was just a fleeting thought. I smiled bitterly and petted Nala.

###chapter 284

Spending some time in the kids' room really helped me unwind.

No matter what happens with my love life, I have four adorable kids and a wonderful mom who loves me.

Honestly, I'm already pretty lucky. People need to learn to be content with what they have.

We had dinner at home, and I couldn't stop raving about Zola's cooking.

"No wonder Brett loves Zola's food. I love it too."

Holding my bowl, I couldn't help but say, "If I ate at home every day, I'd definitely gain weight."

"Ms. Sharp, you should come home for meals more often. I can make lighter dishes too," Zola said with a smile as she served me some soup.

Kelly teased, "Gaining weight would be good for you. You're too skinny right now."

"I think a little more weight would look nice on you."

I pouted, "Only kids and Nala look cute when they're chubby. If I gained weight, I'd look terrible."

"But Mr. Castillo said he likes you no matter what," Brett suddenly chimed in while eating.

I was startled, "Who told you that?"

Brett answered innocently, "Mr. Castillo told me himself! Brett remembers it clearly."

Thinking about Royce saying something like that to the kids made me blush.

Kelly couldn't help but join in, "Royce is really something. When he likes someone, he wants everyone to know."

Kelly knew that Royce and I had cleared up our misunderstandings.

Now she teases me about it almost every day.

I can't blame her. When I was stuck at home, Royce was the one who visited me often.

He's really reliable and considerate in that way.

No wonder Kelly thinks so highly of him.

Last time, when I was crying in Kelly's arms, she was actually trying to comfort me, saying she didn't think Royce was that kind of person.

But I was too upset to listen back then.

After a quick meal, I changed clothes and headed to the office.

I've been busy with Asher's project lately. Once it's done, I plan to take a vacation and go on a picnic with the kids.

I promised them we'd do that.

Looking at the calendar, I realized I'd also need to attend Isadora's baby's one-month celebration soon.

As I was about to finish work, Royce came to the office to see me.

Hearing the commotion outside, my ears felt warm.

"If you all have time to gossip, you can stay and work overtime," I said.

Everyone quickly fell silent, but their eyes still followed Royce and me as we moved.

Royce smiled and took my hand, leading me outside. "Caroline, your employees all know we're a couple."

I whispered back, "We're not yet."

"We will be soon," Royce said confidently.

He didn't seem to find pursuing me troublesome at all.

Royce was picking me up to take me to dinner at a new restaurant he had reserved, which was doing quite well.

On the way, as the driver drove, Royce and I chatted naturally.

I learned something that shocked me.

"You're saying that right after Kathy and I left, Maeve went to visit Brandon?"

Royce nodded, "Just found out. Two days later, there was news that Brandon was going to be released."

"Going to be? Maeve texted me saying Brandon is already out."

The thought of Brandon being released made me feel sick.

Royce held my hand and reassured me, "Caroline, don't worry. No matter what happens, I'm here."

I sighed, "It's partly my fault. I should have submitted more evidence earlier."

"How can you blame yourself? You've done more than enough."

We arrived at the restaurant, but my mind was still on Brandon. "Is there any way we can report him again and get him back in?"

"Re-reporting probably won't work. If they released him, it means someone bailed him out for those charges."

I sighed, "But if he's out I'm worried we'll have even more trouble to deal with."

"That's true," Royce said, handing me the menu. "Caroline, let's order and eat first."

The restaurant Royce brought me to was called Culinary Canvas.

The place was surrounded by glass, but it was covered with plants, and the glass was specially treated so you couldn't see inside from the outside.

At first glance, I thought it was beautiful.

The atmosphere during dinner was nice, and we tried to avoid unpleasant topics.

But thoughts about Brandon and Maeve kept lingering in my mind.

"Royce"

I couldn't help but bring up the topic with him.

Royce looked at me gently, "Why so serious?"

"Because we're not together yet."

Suddenly, my mind was racing.

Royce smiled faintly, "Seems like it."

He was different with me, more natural, almost like he was playfully complaining.

"Let's talk about something serious."

I couldn't completely clear my mind, even during dinner.

Royce didn't mind, asking what I wanted to know.

"Joanna's situation should be fine for now. At least the test results are good."

Royce nodded, "Even if the results are good, we can't be completely at ease. Ronnie is a man, and these diseases might not show symptoms in him, but he could still be a carrier."

He had a point.

I understood that, but knowing Joanna was okay for now was a relief.

"If Joanna realizes something's wrong in her marriage and wants to fix it, what then? Ronnie doesn't seem like he'll end up with Maeve. They both know this is just a transaction."

I remembered Maeve telling me they'd naturally drift apart and wouldn't affect Joanna's family

It made me feel uneasy.

"What should we do? Should we tell Joanna now? I don't know if she can handle it."

Royce's expression darkened, "This is something that needs to be addressed sooner or later. They're married, sharing so much."

Many risks are hidden there, happening unconsciously.

Royce's point was clear: if we wanted to "save" Joanna, it was best to tell her the truth as soon as possible.

"I understand," I said.

But thinking about Kathy and our friends, if it came to it, we'd have to tell Joanna.

I knew Joanna well enough.

She took relationships seriously but wouldn't tolerate betrayal. If she found out about Ronnie and Maeve, she'd likely choose divorce.

The complication was that Joanna's father, Oscar, probably wouldn't want such a scandal before his retirement.

###chapter 285

Someone like Ronnie might not be so quick to just get a divorce...

"And about Brandon..."

Royce brought up another issue.

I nodded. "Brandon? What's up with him?"

"Simon heard that the day after you visited Brandon in prison, Maeve went to see him too. We don't know what they talked about, but soon after, there were rumors that Brandon might be getting out."

"You think someone's pulling strings behind the scenes?"

Royce nodded. "Yeah, that's what I think. There are still some unresolved issues with the Jordan family. We can't let our guard down."

Suddenly, I lost my appetite.

One thing after another, it was exhausting.

The shadow Brandon cast, and everything with the Jordan family-how much longer would it take to get rid of it all?

I stared blankly at the food in front of me, only snapping out of it when I noticed Royce watching me.

"Why aren't you eating either?"

I smiled awkwardly. "Did I ruin your appetite?"

"No, I just wanted to look at you."

Royce's deep voice made me feel warm inside.

"Thank goodness for you."

Looking back, if it hadn't been for Royce, I wouldn't have gotten so much help or managed to leave my previous marriage so smoothly.

"Thanks for all your help during this time."

Royce raised an eyebrow. "Why are you saying this all of a sudden?"

"Are you planning to break up with me?"

His words caught me off guard. "What?"

"You suddenly saying this makes it sound like you don't want to be with me anymore."

Royce's voice had a slight tremble.

I could sense his unease.

I quickly said, "That's not what I meant..."

"So, you do want to be with me?"

The sadness on Royce's face vanished.

He was teasing me!

I widened my eyes. "You were pretending to be sad!"

"Not entirely. I was genuinely worried you didn't want to be with me."

He reached out and gently patted my hand on the table. "Hearing you say that, I feel relieved."

I pouted. "I think you did it on purpose. You just wanted a definite answer from me."

"If I said I wouldn't be with you, would you still pursue me?"

I blushed as I asked.

At my age, I didn't know why I cared so much about this.

Royce laughed. "Do you want me to keep pursuing you?"

"...Yes." My voice was small.

"I didn't hear you."

I pouted. "If you didn't hear, then forget it. I didn't say anything."

After our playful banter, my appetite returned, and I didn't have to think about those annoying people and things anymore.

I ate with a much better mood, and then I heard Royce say seriously, "Even if we're together, I can still buy you flowers every day."

"You want to feel loved and cherished, and I can give you all of that."

I didn't dare look up.

I was afraid that seeing the clear love and tenderness on Royce's face would make me agree to be with him right away.

I had always thought that until Joanna's situation was resolved, I wouldn't be with Royce.

Otherwise, it would feel awkward.

At least until I was sure Joanna would be okay.

But I didn't tell Royce this. After dinner, he drove me home but didn't come upstairs.

"Say hi to Mrs. Sharp and the kids for me."

Royce leaned in for a light hug.

I couldn't help but laugh. "If you want to talk to them, why not come upstairs? Brett said he hasn't seen you in a while."

"I have some work to handle at the office later, so I can't today."

He pinched my cheek, and I shyly pushed his hand away. "Stop that."

"I'll visit with gifts another day."

I agreed and went upstairs alone.

In the lobby, someone called out to me.

"Caroline."

Simon was dressed in black casual clothes and a baseball cap, looking much younger.

I suddenly remembered Kathy saying she didn't want to be with Simon because he seemed too young.

"Caroline, why are you smiling?"

Simon looked at me curiously as he walked over.

I quickly shook my head. "It's nothing. Why are you here? Weren't you busy these past few days?"

"I went to a neighboring city to investigate something and just got back. I checked out that house we were looking for the kids in, and it had burned down, almost to ruins."

I was stunned. "Ruins? Was anyone..."

Was anyone hurt?

Simon knew what I was asking and shook his head. "No, it was an old gas explosion. Luckily, no one was hurt."

"But it made me think. If there were no secrets in that house, why burn it down?"

I agreed. "It is suspicious. Did anyone report it?"

"Yes, someone nearby called it in. The fire department handled it, but since there were no bodies, the police ruled it an accident."

But Simon telling me this meant there were still many questions.

I whispered, "Are you still investigating?"

"Of course. We need to get to the bottom of this." Simon's answer was always reassuring.

"That's good... I'll leave it to you."

Then I remembered Brandon and quickly said, "Oh, there's something else I might need your help with."

I told him about Brandon's possible release and Maeve's actions.

"I know about that too, but I didn't expect them to be so blatant. I'll investigate as thoroughly as I can."

I nodded. "Thank you so much."

"No problem. I'm heading to another city tomorrow. I'll catch up with you and Kathy for dinner when I'm back."

After seeing Simon off, I went home, feeling heavy-hearted.

All these events were overwhelming, but being home felt like a relief.

Especially seeing Kelly busy around the house and the kids being so innocent and happy...

It made all my past struggles feel worth it.

If I hadn't been determined to escape that mess and save myself, I wouldn't have this happy family now, or see my mom and kids.

Thinking of this, I suddenly covered my face and cried.

Kelly saw me crying as she came over, startled, and quickly tried to see my face.

I looked up, tears blurring my vision, and saw her. "Mom..."

###chapter 286

"Why are you crying as soon as you get home? Did something happen outside?"

Kelly's voice was full of concern as she pulled me down to sit on the couch with her.

I shook my head. "No, it's not that. I just had a nightmare last night. I dreamt I was back at home..."

"That place isn't my home anymore. I went through a lot there."

My mom's eyes welled up with tears when she heard me say that.

"It was just a nightmare. You're doing great now."

"Everything now is real... If you have another nightmare, come sleep with me, okay?"

I nodded vigorously. "Okay..."

The truth is, I made up the nightmare. My mind is always flashing back to old memories.

Especially when I hear news about Brandon. It makes me feel like those shadows never left.

It's almost like I'm haunted in real life.

But I couldn't say that in front of Kelly. I was afraid she'd worry even more.

"That's good. Why don't you come sleep with me tonight?" Kelly suddenly hugged my shoulders.

Just like when I was little, holding me close.

"My daughter has grown up so much, and now she has four kids of her own."

Kelly's tone was full of emotion.

"I'm getting old too. I even have gray hair now. It's hard to believe."

I couldn't help but laugh through my tears. "Why are you saying that... You're not old at all. You're still the most beautiful."

"I'm not beautiful anymore. My daughter is the beautiful one." Kelly stroked my hair. "You were beautiful from the moment you were born."

"When I had you in the hospital, the nurses said you were the most beautiful baby they'd ever seen."

I had never heard Kelly mention this before, and I was curious. "Really?"

But in my memory, all newborns look the same, all wrinkly.

How could they think I was beautiful?

Maybe it's because it's your own child, so you see them through rose-colored glasses?

Kelly laughed too. "You silly girl... Can't you just accept a compliment?"

"I just find it strange. Even though I've had kids, I think all newborns look kind of ugly. I don't see the beauty."

Kelly patted my shoulder. "Maybe you'll understand someday... And those four kids of yours are beautiful."

"Of course, as their grandma, you think they're all wonderful." I couldn't help but laugh.

The evening passed quickly, but even a short time with family brought me peace.

In these quiet moments, I felt filled with courage to face the unknown.

The next morning, Simon's whereabouts became strangely mysterious.

I often couldn't reach him. My messages seemed to disappear into a void. I had no idea which city he was in or what he was investigating.

But I knew Simon was on our side and would never betray me.

That gave me some confidence.

Still, I instinctively asked Kathy if she'd heard from Simon lately.

Kathy rolled her eyes at me. "You always ask me. Do you think I'm that close to him?"

I reflexively responded, "Aren't you? You two are pretty tight, right?"

"Well, you're not wrong... Meeting him was quite unexpected."

Kathy blinked. "But there's really nothing between us like you think."

"I get it. I don't think there's anything between you two. It's just that I have so much on my plate right now, and there's no news from Simon about what I asked him to investigate. I'm getting anxious."

I knew I should be patient, and I knew everyone was doing their part, but in practice, it was incredibly hard.

Every minute felt like sitting on pins and needles.

On one hand, there was the unresolved issue with Joanna. Kathy and I still hadn't figured out how to warn her about Ronnie.

Should we be direct, or take it step by step?

We still didn't have an answer.

A day or two passed, and I couldn't help but feel anxious.

On the other hand, there was Brandon.

Brandon was out of prison now. Royce had told me.

"Now that Brandon's out, I really don't know what to do next."

I sighed.

Kathy's eyes widened. "What do you mean he's out? He was really released?"

"Why would I lie? We thought we had it all figured out, getting him locked up for good. We knew it wouldn't be for long, but we planned to submit more evidence later. But with everything going on with the Jordan family, we decided to wait. Who knew that would give them an opportunity."

Now Brandon was out.

Kathy looked serious. "That's terrifying... How could such a bad man be released?"

"They must have connections. If he recanted and appealed, it would give them a reason to reinvestigate. And if someone helped him get a lawyer, it wouldn't be hard."

I had thought it through.

"Actually, if you think about it, it's good he's out. At least we know someone is helping him. There's more to this than we thought. So now I've got Royce looking into it seriously..."

Kathy shook her head. "But still, it's another big problem."

True.

Talking with Kathy, I gave a wry smile. "I asked you out for coffee to relax, but you're making me more anxious."

"Can't help it. I'm a realist. And work has been crazy busy. When you talk about this, I can't help but think of the worst-case scenario."

Kathy shrugged.

She stirred her coffee and complained, "And I'm sick of drinking black coffee to stay in shape."

"Why didn't you say so? Next time, I'll take you for bubble tea," I said softly.

Kathy laughed. "You think I can drink bubble tea?"

"There's a company event coming up. We have to showcase our best designs. I need to look my best."

So that's what she was preparing for.

I thought for a moment. "This event will have important clients, right? Like Joanna?"

Maybe we could use this event to distract Joanna. It might work.

###chapter 287

Kathy nodded. "Since I've worked with Joanna before, we should definitely invite her. But I'm not sure if she'll actually come."

"Yeah, I've been wondering how we should break the news to her..."

At the mention of this, both Kathy and I fell silent.

This was a tough situation for us.

"I still think we need to tell Joanna as soon as possible," I said firmly.

The thought of a possible contagious disease made me anxious to let Joanna know the seriousness of the situation right away.

And from our perspective, she would definitely get a divorce.

Not everyone can handle being the bad guy.

That was the main reason for our unease.

Kathy, hearing my words, made up her mind. "We should tell Joanna before the baby's one-month celebration."

"Why do you think that?" I asked. Even though I had suggested telling Joanna soon, I hadn't thought of a specific date, just sometime in the next few days.

Kathy suddenly gave me a precise time, which puzzled me a bit.

Kathy glanced at me, put down the small spoon in her hand, and said, somewhat exasperated, "Caroline, are you serious?"

"Think about it. At Isadora's baby's one-month celebration, everyone will be talking about marriage and having kids. As someone who's already married, Joanna will definitely be pressured by everyone around her to have a baby."

"If she suddenly gets the idea that babies are cute and decides to go home and sleep with Ronnie..."

That would be a disaster!

I immediately understood what Kathy meant. "You're right."

"We really need to hurry."

"But we don't need to rush too much; there's still a week until the celebration."

Kathy was also worried about Joanna's situation.

The conversation we had at the spa was still fresh in my mind.

Joanna was somewhat inclined to leave this loveless marriage, but she hadn't made up her mind yet, and the surrounding conditions were also restricting her.

"Let's hope they don't suddenly decide to have a heart-to-heart and reconcile in the next few days..."

I sighed.

Kathy thought for a moment. "There's a way to handle this. I have a party coming up soon. I can keep Joanna busy by inviting her to be a model, keeping her distracted. That way, she won't focus on Ronnie."

This temporarily resolved the issue.

I went to the office to handle some of my own matters and confirmed with Asher that the project was gradually being implemented.

Only then did I go home satisfied.

I didn't have to worry about work for the next few days, so I could take a break.

But the issue with Joanna was still weighing on my mind, and I couldn't completely relax.

On my way home, my phone suddenly started vibrating like crazy.

At first, I thought someone was calling me, but when I looked, I saw a flood of messages.

I initially thought it was Yvonne causing trouble again, but upon closer inspection, the tone was different.

And the sender's identity was clear.

It was Brandon, using his old number.

"Caroline, I'm out of prison!"

"Let's see how you fight me now! You think you're so tough?"

"I'm telling you, I'm going to make you pay for all the suffering I endured, and then some!"

"You thought you had me, didn't you? Last time you even pretended to be nice to me, and I believed you!"

His messages weren't filled with insults, just threats of revenge, but they made my heart race.

Cold sweat broke out on my forehead, and I didn't know how to feel...

I just knew that seeing these messages made me dizzy.

I didn't understand why he contacted me as soon as he got out of prison.

But I didn't reply. After a while, he started calling me frantically.

I was startled and quickly blocked his number.

We had already deleted and blocked each other on all other platforms, so he couldn't reach me for now.

I had kept this number for evidence when I reported him, but now it had backfired.

Staring at the screen, I calmed myself and took screenshots of the messages to send to Royce.

A moment later, Royce replied with a question mark.

I explained the situation with Brandon, and he sent me several voice messages.

"Don't worry, I'll talk to the police."

"I've been investigating who's been helping him from the shadows. I have a feeling that solving this will uncover a bigger conspiracy... and we might catch a bigger mastermind."

"So stay calm. I'll make sure you're safe. I'll arrange for someone to pick you up and drop you off for the next few days."

Hearing Royce's voice reassured me.

But on my way home, I didn't dare linger. I took a cab and only relaxed when I reached my apartment complex.

I decided to follow Royce's advice and have someone pick me up starting tomorrow. I wouldn't drive myself.

I was really scared.

Maeve's cryptic words came to mind, but one thing she said was true.

Brandon had nothing to lose now.

His goal was revenge.

After all, he had already burned his bridges. For him, attacking was the only way to turn the tables.

So ensuring our safety was the most important thing.

That night, another unknown number started bombarding me with texts and calls.

I set my phone to block all unknown calls and asked Royce to help me get a new number for work.

I thought this would temporarily stop Brandon's harassment, but the next day, I got a call from the property management, asking me to handle something at my old house.

When I got there, I saw a crowd gathered at the door.

I pushed through the crowd, thinking something had happened, and saw red paint splashed all over the front door.

The red paint was glaringly obvious!

A worker was scrubbing it off, and Kelly was standing at the door. When she saw me, she rushed over and grabbed my hand.

"Caroline, thank goodness you're back..."

I held my mom's hand tightly and whispered, "What happened?"

Seeing this as soon as I arrived made me really scared.

###chapter 288

"I don't know either. Someone from your property management called me and told me to come over... When I got here, I saw the paint on the door."

Kelly shook her head and said, "Didn't you say you were gonna sell this place? Why are they still contacting us?"

I had thought about selling the house before because Brandon knew the address. He might come back to cause trouble every now and then. After he broke in last time, I really thought selling it would bring peace.

Who knew that before I could even put it on the market, someone else would come and cause trouble.

I felt overwhelmed. "Mom, I'm here. I'll talk to the property management. You should go home; the kids need someone to watch them."

"Why don't you call Royce to come over and stay with you?"

Kelly looked at me, clearly worried about me being alone.

I nodded and called Royce in front of Kelly.

Royce said he'd come over right away, which finally put Kelly at ease. She took a cab back home.

I asked Kelly to let me know when she got home safely.

Just the fact that Brandon was out had everyone on edge.

I made a sudden decision in my heart.

I had to resolve this quickly...

Otherwise, we'd be living in constant fear!

By the time Royce arrived, the workers had almost finished cleaning the paint off the door.

Seeing me standing at the door, Royce hurried over and put his arm around my shoulders. "Sorry I'm late. Traffic was terrible."

"It's okay. I appreciate you coming over so late."

Honestly, I didn't want to trouble him at first, but with my mom there, I couldn't just send her away. She'd definitely worry about my safety.

After thinking it over, calling Royce seemed like the best option.

Hearing my words, Royce frowned and pinched my nose. "Don't say that."

"I told you, no matter what happens, I'll come to be with you right away."

The workers finished cleaning, and I paid them before they left. Then I remembered to go with Royce to the property management office to check the surveillance footage.

But after looking for a while, the property manager said that there had been a temporary power outage for maintenance this afternoon, leaving a gap in the footage.

"How convenient," I said, frustrated.

Everything was just too coincidental!

The property manager waved his hand. "I know this might be inconvenient for you, but the notice was sent out a few days ago..."

"A few days ago?"

Royce and I exchanged a look, immediately realizing the seriousness of the situation.

A few days ago, Brandon hadn't even been released yet!

When this happened today, my first thought was that Brandon did it.

But now, if someone saw the notice and planned this knowing the cameras would be down, who could have helped Brandon arrange all this?

Royce pulled me closer. "Don't think too much about it. Let's file a report."

I nodded and went with him to the police station to give a statement.

The property management didn't expect something like this to happen in just half a day. They apologized repeatedly and promised to cooperate with the investigation.

The paint incident really got to me. On the way back, I told Royce, "I was planning to sell this house, but now with this happening, I doubt anyone would buy it."

"There's no rush to sell the house. Does Brandon know where you're living now?" Royce asked, clearly worried we might still be harassed.

I shook my head. "Brandon shouldn't know, but if someone is helping him, I can't be sure they don't know."

"They chose an empty house to make a statement. They probably won't come to your place for now. Not every neighborhood will have a power outage for maintenance," Royce reassured me, helping me relax a bit.

"So what do you think we should do now?" I realized I had become very dependent on Royce. At this moment, I didn't want to think. I just wanted to ask him what to do.

Royce looked at me. "You want to know what to do now? If it were up to me, I'd take you home, make sure you get a good night's sleep, and let your mom know everything's fine. As for the rest, I'll help you investigate."

Royce lowered his voice. "I'll arrange for someone to pick you up and drop you off at work for the next few days. Wherever you go, let my people know. And at home, whether it's your mom or the housekeeper... someone should always be around."

Hearing the seriousness in his voice, I sighed. "When will this ever end..."

I didn't want to live in fear forever.

Royce shook his head. "It'll be over soon."

Even though he said that, we both knew it was just to comfort me.

The next day, I decided to talk to Kathy about how to distract Joanna and tell her about the situation. But an unexpected visitor found me first.

Seeing Alfonso standing at the office entrance, I frowned. "What are you doing here?"

He had been trying to collaborate and bid on various projects, but I had already turned him down.

Alfonso walked over with a smile, and I instinctively took a step back. But this was a public place; he wouldn't do anything here. Thinking that, I forced myself to stay calm as Alfonso approached.

"Caroline, I'm not here to talk business today. I'm here to give you a heads-up."

A heads-up? Could it be about Brandon? I couldn't think of anything else he might want to warn me about.

I replied instinctively, "I don't need your heads-up."

"I think you do. I know Brandon is out, and he's probably done quite a bit to you already, hasn't he?"

Alfonso knew about this! My eyes widened, and Alfonso clearly noticed my reaction.

"Looks like I'm right. I'm just warning you, Brandon isn't as simple as he seems."

He really isn't, I thought to myself, keeping a straight face.

Alfonso seemed to be studying my expression. After a moment, he said, "I know you won't listen to me, but you need to stay alert. Brandon won't stop at just this. More will come."

I stayed silent. Just the texts and the paint were already too much. If there's more to come...

I frowned. "What's your angle in warning me about this?"

Alfonso smiled. "Me? I enjoy a good show. But as my business competitor, I don't want you to be distracted."

###chapter 289

"What do you mean you don't want me to be influenced?"

I couldn't quite figure out Alfonso, but my gut told me his presence wasn't a good sign.

The bidding war with Asher was a clear example.

Alfonso was the kind of person who would use my child as leverage to force my hand, showing he had no moral boundaries when it came to his interests.

And let's not forget, Isadora's investigation for her sister was still fresh in my mind!

Alfonso had definitely caused the death of his first wife and was now flaunting his affair...

All signs pointed to him being a heartless person.

I took two steps back, trying to subtly increase the distance between us. "What you're saying is strange. We're in the same business circle. You have plenty of ways to find out about me. Why bring up my ex-husband in front of me?"

"Ex-husband? Caroline, you might fool others about your divorce with Brandon, but you can't fool me."

Alfonso spoke with a confidence that made me uneasy.

I had no idea what he was planning.

If Alfonso and Brandon were connected, shouldn't he be trying to hide it? Or maybe, since Brandon had been rescued, Alfonso felt there was no need to keep it a secret?

This situation seemed to align with my assessment of Brandon.

They were so blatant because they had someone powerful backing them!

"So, I think they might not be afraid of us at all. They might even want me to know everything, so they can confront me directly."

I shared my encounter with Alfonso with Royce.

Royce sat beside me, sipping his coffee calmly as he listened.

"What do you think?"

His silence made me anxious.

Lately, I had grown accustomed to seeking his help. If he ignored me even a little, I felt uneasy.

Royce gently took my hand, reassuring me. "Caroline, I was just thinking about something else, so I didn't respond right away."

"But I heard everything you said."

He stroked my hair, and I looked at him.

His every action made me feel safe and secure.

It felt like I could trust him completely.

But when it came to our relationship, I was unsure if I should take the next step.

This was one of the things that had been troubling me lately.

"Why did you call me here if you two are just going to flirt?"

Kathy's voice broke the moment.

I pulled away from Royce's hand, feeling a bit awkward. "Kathy, you're finally here."

"When you messaged me, I thought you wanted to have afternoon tea. I didn't expect him to be here too."

Kathy loved to joke around, and her teasing lightened the mood.

"Stop it. We're discussing something serious."

My cheeks felt warm. Even though I'd been married before, being teased about Royce still made me shy.

"So, what's the latest?" Kathy asked, ordering from the waiter before turning back to us.

I filled her in on Alfonso's visit.

Kathy frowned. "That damn Alfonso. If Isadora knew, she'd be even angrier than us."

He was already linked to Celestia's death, and now he wouldn't leave us alone.

"That's why I didn't tell them and came to you first."

"But Caroline, I think your analysis is spot on."

Alfonso's boldness showed he wasn't afraid. Kathy and I were on the same page.

We asked Royce for his thoughts, and he agreed but added something.

"If Alfonso and Brandon are trying to escalate things, maybe it's intentional. Let's see what they're planning."

I looked at Royce. "You want to go after Alfonso?"

Royce nodded. "The child is safe, and Asher has started a new project. We can deal with Alfonso without any burden. Plus, he can only come at us through business, so we can fight back openly."

He glanced at me. "But Caroline, you'll have to handle this. It'll be tough."

I shook my head. "I don't mind. As long as we can resolve this, it's worth it."

But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something. Looking at Royce and Kathy, I tried to stay calm. These were people who cared about me. I couldn't let them down by panicking.

Alfonso's words, "You underestimate Brandon," kept echoing in my mind. If only Simon were here, he could find more clues, I thought.

As if on cue, Kathy's phone rang. She glanced at it and answered. It was Simon.

"What did he say?" When she hung up, her expression was grim.

"What did Simon say?" Royce and I were curious. Given the timing and Simon's recent investigations, he must have found something!

Kathy thought for a moment. "Simon said Alfonso is also connected to Maeve..."

Maeve?! Royce and I were stunned. What role did Maeve play in all this?

"Don't worry. Simon suggests we talk to Isadora. To deal with Alfonso, we should start with Celestia's case..."

I sighed. "Easier said than done. Isadora just had a baby. Bringing up painful memories isn't fair."

I could already picture Isadora's distress. Celestia was harmed by Alfonso, and Joanna's husband Ronnie was seduced by Maeve. Now these two were connected. It was a double betrayal.

Kathy understood my concern and talked with me for a while. Royce stepped out to take a call, leaving the café. I watched him through the window. Royce was undeniably attractive.

###chapter 290

He was wearing a black trench coat, his tall figure exuding an air of maturity and confidence. Every gesture and movement radiated the charm and presence of a seasoned man. Even his profile had shed its former boyishness, becoming more handsome. For a moment, I felt like I was seeing the old him again. All the memories of my teenage crush came flooding back.

"Caroline, what's up? Why do you look like you're about to cry?" Kathy's voice snapped me back to reality. I glanced over and saw Royce outside on the phone. I sighed, feeling a pang in my chest. "How can you be so affected after just a short time apart?"

I suddenly choked up. "It's not that, Kathy. I was just thinking, if only there hadn't been so many misunderstandings back then."

If only Royce hadn't left without a word. If only we had stayed together... I wouldn't have met Brandon, wouldn't have gone through so much crap, and wouldn't have dragged so many people into this mess!

"Sometimes I get sentimental, thinking that if I hadn't fallen into Brandon's trap, none of this would have happened."

I sniffled. "Even though I know it's silly to think that way."

"No, Caroline, it's not silly at all." Kathy sighed, gripping my hand tightly. "You think that way because you're too kind. You don't want your friends to get hurt. But to be blunt, with the complicated environment and dynamics of the Jordan family, even if Brandon hadn't found you, it could have been someone else!"

Kathy's words brought me back to my senses. Yeah, even if it wasn't me, someone else would have been dragged into the Jordan family's mess. Given Brandon's methods at the time, he would likely have found another wealthy person like me!

Kathy hugged me tightly and said, "Caroline, don't think like that. Consider it a journey of growth. If God gave you this test, it means He believes you can get through it. Think about it, if it were someone else, they might not have survived! You're destined to struggle through and help others. Caroline, we'll have our sweet moments after the hardships."

Kathy's words, as tough as she could be, really hit home. I nodded, wiped my tears, and said, "We need to get ready for the party. I need to meet a few business partners."

After everything with Alfonso and Ronnie, I was even more disillusioned with men. I even considered only doing business with women. Except for Asher.

"How about I invest in you starting a design company and a new brand? Once I become an investor, I don't plan on running around anymore."

I really was feeling a bit tired! Now I just wanted to stay home, be with Kelly, and be a mom to my four kids. Speaking of which, since the kids came back, I hadn't really spent much time alone with them.

Kathy rolled her eyes at me. "You really are impulsive. Let's get through this party first."

I was grateful that all my friends had their own careers. Joanna too. At least when facing emotional setbacks and betrayals, we could still hold our heads high!

Just as we thought, Isadora almost lost it when she found out about Alfonso and Maeve.

"You guys told me about Joanna, and I still haven't recovered! Now there's Alfonso too!" Isadora gritted her teeth.

We only told her about Joanna after confirming the facts. I quickly said, "Don't get too upset. You just had a baby, you can't afford to get angry."

"I can't help it... Think about it, if Celestia were still alive, my child would have an aunt," Isadora said, tears streaming down her face.

Losing a loved one is a hurdle no one can easily overcome. We had planned to let Isadora rest, at least until after the baby's one-month celebration. But soon after, Isadora suddenly said, "No, I have to help you with this. Is there anything I can do? Investigate or something..."

She was anxious, speaking faster than usual. I quickly said, "Not for now. We have a lot of leads, but we're stuck."

Isadora's husband had a special job, and we didn't want to drag her into this. "Just focus on the baby's one-month celebration. We've all prepared gifts and are looking forward to it."

Kathy and I quickly changed the subject. But since we had already told her, Isadora sat on the bed, eyes downcast, lost in thought. Kathy and I exchanged glances, feeling that telling her might have been a mistake.

Given Isadora's current state, she had too much to deal with. And now, bringing up Alfonso would surely stir up more emotions...

But Kathy and I had thought it through. Since Isadora would soon return to normal life, she would inevitably run into Alfonso in this city. We couldn't keep her in a bubble, shielding her from everything.

When Marshall came back and saw us all there, he was surprised. We looked at him and teased, "You two have such a great relationship, visiting Isadora every day."

Isadora, distracted, looked up at Marshall and smiled, "The baby just fell asleep. I'm chatting with my friends. Why are you home so early?"

Marshall nodded at us, "Thank you for visiting Isadora." Then he leaned in and whispered something to Isadora. She playfully pushed him away, smiling.

Marshall laughed, "We'll arrange it that way then." They looked so happy together.

As Kathy and I left the hospital, we talked about it. We were both entering new stages in our lives, though not by choice.

I had gone through a tumultuous divorce with Brandon, leaving many scars. Now, resolving the issues with the kids gave me peace, allowing me to move on.

As for Kathy, after seeing what we went through, she didn't want to get married. She was thriving in her career.

Joanna was still in the dark, but Ronnie had already cheated. Even though we agreed not to tell Joanna yet, we knew it couldn't stay hidden forever. And Royce was pressuring me to make a decision.

The happiest among us was probably Isadora. Especially after visiting her today.

"Sometimes I think, if only I hadn't married Brandon back then."

###chapter 291

I had that feeling again.

"If I had just waited a little longer for Royce to come back, maybe things wouldn't have turned out this way."

I stood by the river, staring at the water, and said to Kathy beside me.

This was different from my usual regrets.

It wasn't about thinking that marrying Brandon was a mistake that led to all these traps.

It was simply that if I had chosen to wait, maybe I could have had a happier life, like Isadora now.

A life without worries...

But then, I wouldn't have my four adorable kids.

Everything is arranged by fate in mysterious ways.

Kathy knew what I was thinking and patted my shoulder.

She stood next to me, watching the river, and we both fell silent for a while.

After a bit, I couldn't stop thinking about Joanna.

I turned to Kathy and said, "Tomorrow is the private event. Let's talk to Joanna then."

"Are you sure it's not too soon? We haven't gathered all the information yet."

Kathy was surprised by my suggestion.

I could tell she wasn't mentally prepared for this, and my words made her a bit scared.

I shook my head. "We can't delay this any longer. Joanna isn't infected now, but the longer we wait, the more risks there are."

"If we keep dragging this out, things will only get worse."

With Alfonso making moves and Maeve always lurking, I realized Royce was right to push me to make this decision for everyone's sake.

Kathy shook her head. "Caroline, it's not that I'm worried about the event causing trouble..."

I understood.

"I just think, if we're going to talk to Joanna, we need to consider if her family will allow her to divorce. If her family is dealing with something right now, telling her this will only add to the chaos."

Joanna had mentioned this to us before.

Her family was unique, and because of Oscar's job, they took her marriage and divorce very seriously.

When she got married, Ronnie might not have been thoroughly vetted, but once married, divorce wasn't easy.

It was a headache, but I had made up my mind. "I don't want to think about that anymore. Those bad people never hesitate when they do bad things."

"They hurt others for their own gain, so why should we hesitate when we're trying to do good?"

This was a shift in my mindset today.

Kathy saw my point.

"Alright, I support you. I need to go prepare for tomorrow's event and check the venue..."

"Do you want to come with me?"

I checked the time. It was still early.

No need to go home yet.

So I nodded to Kathy. "I'll come with you."

Even though I had made up my mind, thinking about talking to Joanna tomorrow made me want to distract myself and figure out what to say.

Maybe going early would help me get used to the environment.

Kathy hailed a cab, and we headed to the hotel we had booked.

We hadn't driven today when we went to see Isadora.

It was a five-star hotel called Elysium Palace.

Kathy had booked two large banquet halls. Originally, they were lavishly decorated, but her design team had transformed them.

It looked like a fashion runway now, with creative designs made from fabric scraps and other materials.

After a tour, I couldn't help but praise, "This venue is amazing."

"This is the most unique private event I've ever attended."

Kathy smiled proudly. "Of course. I put a lot of effort into this."

She showed me around, explaining the arrangements.

"Tomorrow, you and Joanna will model some of my latest designs."

I was wide-eyed. "Model? Me?"

"Joanna can, but I can't..."

Kathy patted my shoulder and pinched my cheek.

"What's going on, Caroline? You've become so insecure lately. Last time, you said you weren't suited for the makeup I did. Now you don't want to model... You're still young, why do you feel so old?"

Her words hit me hard.

Suddenly, my nose tingled...

I didn't expect to cry, but tears streamed down my face.

Kathy, thinking she had said something wrong, quickly grabbed tissues to wipe my tears.

She asked what was wrong.

I shook my head, feeling a strange mix of emotions.

Kathy was right. Lately, I felt unworthy of good things. Even the chance to model, I thought should go to those with happy marriages.

I didn't want to cause trouble.

Especially knowing Joanna and others would be there, I felt I didn't belong.

I had a failed marriage and four kids.

I cried as I explained my thoughts. I wasn't sure if Kathy understood, but she looked at me with compassion.

She didn't say anything, just hugged me.

"Caroline, you've been through so much."

Kathy patted my back.

"You've handled everything so well, especially with Simon here, planning and investigating. I forgot you were carrying so much pain."

"As your friend, I should have noticed sooner. I'm sorry."

Kathy comforted me like a child, saying many things.

Until a staff member hurried over, "Ms. Patel, we still need to finalize the decorations for the staircase."

###chapter 292

"The staircase over here looks pretty bare and unappealing."

Hearing the staff member's comment, I quickly wiped my tears and urged Kathy to go handle the issue.

Even though I was suddenly reminded of my past experiences and felt a pang of sadness, I didn't want to delay Kathy's important work.

Kathy glanced at me but stubbornly held my hand and led me to the stairs.

At this moment, she probably didn't feel comfortable leaving me alone.

It was then that I noticed the venue had a separate staircase design.

Maybe it was to make it easier for people to walk the runway.

Kathy looked around and said, "This staircase does look pretty bare."

She asked the hotel if they had any backup plans.

Their team discussed it for a while but still couldn't figure out how to decorate the staircase.

A staff member said, "The staircase was originally supposed to have a red carpet, but our red carpet doesn't match the decor of your venue... If we lay it down, it might look a bit out of place."

Kathy looked again and then walked up and down the stairs.

She said, "No, we need to put a carpet on these stairs. They're too slippery."

Hearing Kathy's words, I walked up and down the stairs too.

I realized she was right.

The stairs were made of smooth marble, and if someone wore shoes with soles that weren't slip-resistant, they could easily fall.

Thinking about the models walking back and forth in their high heels, the consequences of a fall could be disastrous.

I said, "We should put a carpet down. The stairs are pretty inconspicuous on the side, so a red carpet won't be a problem."

Kathy nodded, "Let's do that then..."

After checking the venue and solving the carpet issue, we headed out.

Not long after we left, Kathy suddenly said she felt the floor was unusually slippery, not like normal.

I thought for a moment and said, "You're right. Normal marble floors can be a bit slippery, but they usually have some resistance."

How could it be that slippery?

Thinking back, it did feel a bit too slick.

Kathy suddenly grabbed my hand and whispered, "You reminded me of something. While arranging the venue, my assistant told me a man came by, saying he wanted to book the banquet hall. But when he found out we had reserved it, he just looked around and left."

"This man came by twice."

Hearing this detail, Kathy and I both turned pale: "Could this man have tampered with the stairs?"

Kathy nodded, "I didn't think about it before, but now we have to investigate."

She then made a phone call.

I thought she was calling Simon, but after a while, I heard a woman's voice on the other end.

When Kathy hung up, I nudged her with my elbow, "Who were you talking to?"

"A friend of Simon's. She used to be a private investigator. Simon's been really busy lately, so he introduced her to me."

So there was someone helping us behind the scenes.

I shook my head, not thinking too much about it, and just told Kathy to inform me of any unexpected situations.

"There's nothing unexpected now. Tomorrow is the private custom event. Tonight, we'll fix the carpet, and tomorrow morning I'll have someone check the venue for anything unusual."

Kathy patted me, "Alright. I brought you to see the venue, and you ended up crying. I feel a bit bad."

"I'll take you home now, and then I'll head back to the office to finish up."

I rubbed my nose, feeling a bit embarrassed, "I got emotional suddenly. I didn't plan on crying."

"You still cry easily, just like before."

Kathy laughed, but there was a hint of melancholy in her eyes.

"But, Caroline... I've been thinking about you and Royce lately. I understand what you said earlier. If I had stopped you from marrying a man you barely knew, maybe things would have turned out differently."

We both lowered our eyes.

Some things are in the past and can't be changed. Missed opportunities never come back.

No matter what, my blind marriage ended in tragedy, and that's an unchangeable fact.

Sensing the heavy atmosphere, Kathy said, "But it's okay now. Royce is back, and you can rekindle your relationship."

"Caroline, I wish you a happy marriage this time... and that you never go through such a terrible experience again."

I hugged Kathy tightly.

"Thank you!"

On the way back, I got a call from Maeve.

I didn't notice the caller ID at first, just saw it was a WhatsApp call and answered.

When I heard Maeve's voice, I glanced at the screen.

Maeve asked, "Caroline, did you tell Joanna about it?"

"We didn't tell her. What do you mean?"

I frowned.

Kathy and I had just decided to tell Joanna tomorrow, so why was Maeve calling me today?

Even if she had inside information, she couldn't know about this.

Only Kathy and I knew about the decision.

Kathy would never betray me.

Maeve's call must mean something else happened.

Thinking this, I was about to ask when Maeve hurriedly said, "You better not have told her."

"Joanna and Ronnie's families have had a lot of issues lately. If you don't want more trouble, do as I say."

She hung up right after.

I stood there, staring at my phone, unable to process it.

I suddenly felt that adding Maeve's contact was a mistake!

Now she could reach me and threaten me anytime.

How was this different from Brandon?

Since the divorce, I hated being blackmailed the most!

I stood there, calming myself, then put my phone away and headed home.

I planned to call Royce about this, but suddenly didn't feel like taking out my phone.

As I walked along the roadside, a car honked at me.

I turned and saw it was Royce's car.

###chapter 293

The car pulled over to the side of the road, and I hopped in, turning to ask, "What are you doing here?"

We were just a short distance from my house.

Did he come here just to find me?

Earlier, Kathy had dropped me off nearby. I told her I wanted to take a walk along the roadside, so she let me out.

Royce raised an eyebrow at my question. "Is it really that weird for me to be in your neighborhood?"

"Not weird, just... you didn't text or call me. You just showed up out of nowhere. A heads-up would've been nice."

Thinking about Kelly's enthusiasm for Royce and what I had said to her last time, I felt a bit guilty.

After clearing up the misunderstanding with Royce, I hadn't properly talked to Kelly about it.

If Royce was planning to visit Kelly now, it might be a bit awkward...

Just as I was about to say something, Royce started the car.

And he left me with a sentence.

"I did text you. You just didn't see it."

Hearing Royce's words, I opened my mouth, about to say something, but instinctively pulled out my phone to check.

Sure enough, Royce had indeed sent me a message.

Just a few minutes before Maeve called me, he had sent a WhatsApp message.

He mentioned that he had bought some gifts today, including a necklace he had ordered a while back, and planned to bring them to my house to visit Kelly.

Seeing the list of gifts he had brought, I quickly turned to look at the car's trunk.

Sure enough, there were several stacked boxes.

"Why did you buy so many gifts..."

I was startled.

Suddenly, I remembered Royce's habit of visiting my house and turned to ask him, "When I wasn't home for those years, did you always bring this many gifts when you visited?"

"Not really. I was worried it would put too much pressure on Mrs. Sharp, so I mostly brought some health supplements."

I asked quietly, "Then why so many this time?"

Royce sighed.

At that moment, the light turned red, and the car stopped.

Amidst the bustling traffic, I could feel the atmosphere in the car becoming subtly intimate.

"Our relationship is different now. I'm officially pursuing you, so of course, I can't visit your house as casually as before."

My heart tightened.

"Even though I haven't agreed to be with you yet, you still put in so much effort to visit my house?"

Royce smiled, reached over to hold my hand, and said softly, "Caroline, I've told you before, I'm serious about you."

"Today, whether you were here or not, I had already decided to visit your house. I wanted to have a good talk with Mrs. Sharp. Maybe by the time you got home, we would have already finished talking. Who knew I'd run into you on the way."

It sounded like Royce was a bit reluctant.

I pulled my hand away and looked out the window in a huff. "Then you didn't have to call me from the roadside."

The light turned green, and the car started moving again, heading towards my house.

Royce's gentle voice sounded in my ear, "I saw you, how could I leave you alone on the street?"

Hearing this, my heart suddenly felt warm.

No matter how much things changed, Royce was still Royce.

As the car reached my house, I suddenly remembered that I hadn't properly explained things to Kelly about Royce and me...

Bringing Royce home like this, Kelly would definitely tease me later!

So, as I got out of the car, I hesitated and said to Royce, "Can you let me go up first and talk to my mom for a bit before you come in?"

Royce had just opened the trunk and was taking things out. He looked at me steadily, then, as if thinking of something, teased, "Is it because you told Kelly you wouldn't be with me after the incident with Yvonne?"

It was pretty much what I had told Kelly...

I was speechless. "How do you know about that!"

Royce shook his head calmly.

"I've been visiting Mrs. Sharp regularly. Lately, I've been too busy to go. Do you think if I hadn't visited for a while, Mrs. Sharp wouldn't have noticed something was up?"

I bit my lip. "Anyway, let me go up first..."

"But I bought so many things. Are you going to make me carry them all by myself?"

Royce shrugged and looked at the gift boxes beside him.

I hesitated for a moment, realizing he probably couldn't carry all of them alone.

Resigned, I stepped forward and helped him carry a couple of boxes.

We finally got into the elevator.

At my front door, I glanced at the two of us.

Suddenly, it felt like we were a married couple...

Almost like we were visiting my parents after getting married.

Carrying all these bags, facing Royce's future mother-in-law.

Thinking of this, my cheeks suddenly felt hot.

The door opened, and Kelly looked at me, startled. "Why are you carrying so many things..."

Her gaze then fell on Royce's face, looking a bit awkwardly at me.

This was exactly the kind of scene I was worried about.

I quickly ushered Royce to put the things in the living room, and Kelly hurriedly pulled me aside, "Didn't you say you broke up with him? What's going on now?"

"Mom, how could I just break up with him..." Thinking about explaining this, I felt a headache coming on, so I simply held Kelly's hand and acted spoiled, "Besides, don't you like him? You think he's a good person!"

"I do think he's a good person, but it's important that you like him. If you said it wasn't working out, what could I say!"

Kelly was anxious.

"You're not doing this just to please me, are you?"

I thought, this misunderstanding is huge!

I quickly explained the whole situation with Yvonne and what Royce did afterward to Kelly.

Hearing that the issue with Yvonne was resolved, Kelly finally breathed a sigh of relief. "That's great. I knew Royce wasn't that kind of man."

"I've been so busy, I didn't get a chance to tell you." I felt a bit embarrassed.

Royce had come over today, and Kelly still had this misunderstanding.

Kelly looked at me and sighed, "But Caroline, I remember what you told me last time... No matter what happens, I don't want you to force yourself."

"Mom, I'm not forcing myself."

I quickly reassured Kelly and then went to help Royce put the things away.

When I turned around, Brett had already come back and was chatting happily with Royce.

Seeing their smiling faces, I felt a bit dazed.

###chapter 294

Kelly followed me outside and, seeing Royce and Brett chatting over there, sighed again.

She was right next to me, so I heard her clearly.

I turned and took Kelly's hand, asking softly, "Mom, what's up?"

Was she feeling that the situation was tricky?

Actually, with Royce visiting, my biggest worry was that because of the misunderstanding between us last time, she might hold some resentment towards him.

Kelly was definitely on my side.

But in the past, Royce's care for our family surely made my mom think he was a good person.

The relationship between Royce and me has always been stuck here, partly because of this.

In my subconscious, if we really started dating and then broke up, we probably wouldn't stay in touch...

Then the friendly relationship between my family and him would end too.

He wouldn't visit Kelly during the holidays like he used to.

That would be too weird. How could we stay friends after breaking up?

My thoughts were in turmoil, and Kelly patted my hand. "Caroline, I do think the current situation isn't great."

"Especially since you told me clearly last time that you definitely won't have any more children. Royce is at the age to settle down and start a family. Will he want his own kids in the future?"

Hearing this, I felt a pang of sadness again.

Actually, the topic of children was something I would have to discuss with Royce sooner or later.

But maybe I was subconsciously avoiding it, not wanting any rifts between us...

People are selfish.

Even though I knew I wouldn't have more children and might be unfair to Royce in this regard, I still selfishly wanted to hold onto our connection and have him keep pursuing me.

Thinking about this sent a shiver down my spine.

"I'll find time to talk to him about the kids."

"If he can't accept it, then we should just stay friends."

I've already been very happy enjoying Royce's unconditional care for me during this time.

I can't keep holding onto him.

Kelly looked at me lovingly and patted my head.

I knew she had a lot to say to me, and the current situation left everyone feeling helpless...

It was the many things weighing on my mind lately that made me overlook this point.

What I really needed to resolve was my relationship with Royce.

I suddenly realized why I felt strange seeing Royce come to my house with bags of gifts today.

It was because I wasn't ready to accept all this.

Soon, Brett came running over to me, with Nala following beside him.

The sight of them running together was incredibly heartwarming to me.

"Slow down, slow down, why are you running in the house?"

I laughed as I caught Brett.

Nala rubbed against my leg, and I found a cat treat to feed her slowly.

Nala was almost an old cat now, I thought.

After licking the treat clean, she stretched contentedly beside me.

I then turned to Brett, "What's up?"

"Mom, I have something to tell you..."

"In a few days, our school is having a parent-teacher conference. Will you be free then?"

Hearing this, I immediately nodded. "What do you mean? Of course, I'll be free."

"I just thought you were really busy lately. I told Mr. Castillo, and he said if you couldn't make it, he'd go to the conference for me."

I couldn't help but laugh. "I'm still here, and you want someone else to go to the parent-teacher conference for you?"

"Mr. Castillo said you've been swamped and didn't want me to bother you," Brett replied earnestly.

I pinched his cheek. "I get that you and Mr. Castillo are close. He's a good guy. But the parent-teacher conference is something I need to be at."

Saying this made me feel emotional.

Brett and Royce had such a good relationship. If Royce really became his stepdad, the parent-child relationship wouldn't be so difficult.

But the key issue was that Royce wanting his own kids was still a thorn in my heart...

Even if he liked Brett a lot and Brett was good to him, they didn't have a blood relationship.

Realizing I was getting stuck on this again, I quickly changed the topic. "What do we need to prepare for the parent-teacher conference?"

"Nothing special, just you being there. The teacher will talk about our progress."

Brett explained, and I nodded.

"What's the exact date? Tell me so I can arrange it."

As we talked, Nala circled around us and then went back to her cat bed to sleep.

I took Brett back to the kids' room and checked on the other three children.

Zola was busy in the kids' room, putting away some toys.

When she saw me, she greeted me. "Ms. Sharp, you're back."

"Why are you tidying up in the middle of the day?" I realized my tone wasn't great and quickly added, "I mean, you don't have to tidy up every day."

Kelly and the others all said they liked Zola, so she must be doing a good job at our house.

But I didn't expect her to be so diligent, tidying up the kids' room in the middle of the day.

Zola looked at me and shook her head. "It's no trouble. I'm just keeping busy, and the kids are very well-behaved... As a nanny, I don't have much to do."

She said this while putting away a puzzle piece.

"These things need to be put away quickly. If the kids bump into them, it wouldn't be good."

I quickly thanked her for her effort.

Zola was a typical hardworking woman, efficient in her work, and didn't need anyone to push her to get things done.

Kelly was very satisfied with her, probably because of this.

Brett ran over and grabbed her hand. "Zola, Zola, what are we having for dinner?"

"I'll make a big meal for you tonight. I heard we have a guest!"

Zola must have seen Royce at the door earlier.

I smiled. "Then we'll have a feast tonight."

Soon, I left the kids' room and saw Kelly and Royce sitting on the couch.

They were talking, sitting two seats apart.

As I came out, I heard Kelly's voice, choked with emotion. "Caroline has been through so much. I just want her to be happy from now on."

Seeing me, Kelly awkwardly turned away and wiped her eyes with a tissue.

Royce stood up and walked towards me. "What's wrong?"

He took my hand gently, his voice soft.

###chapter 295

"I thought you were mad at me for making me chat with Mrs. Sharp while you hung out in the kids' room."

Royce had been to my house before, so he knew the layout and that I had been in the kids' room.

I shook my head and patted his hand.

I knew my expression probably didn't look great right now.

Why was my mom crying while talking to Royce?

I walked over to Kelly, sat beside her, and gently wiped her tears with a tissue.

"Mom... how did you end up crying like this? Did Royce say something bad to you? I'll give him a piece of my mind."

Hearing my words, Royce came over too. "I didn't say anything bad. I was just promising Mrs. Sharp that I would take good care of you."

Take good care of me in the future?

If that was the topic, it wasn't surprising that Kelly was crying.

I looked at Kelly. "Is that really what you were talking about?"

Kelly looked at me and then broke into a smile through her tears. "You always act like a little girl in front of me, asking all these innocent questions."

"Even if I talked to Royce, what does it have to do with you? Royce and I are good friends. What's wrong with having a conversation?"

Hearing Kelly say that, I knew she didn't want to say too much in front of Royce.

I shook my head. "Fine, fine, you two are close. You chat away. I'll head out."

I pretended to get up and leave, but Royce grabbed my arm.

"Wait. I'll tell you what we talked about."

As he grabbed me, I kept moving forward, and the momentum made me fall into his arms, creating a moment of intimacy.

Kelly watched this scene and started crying again. "I really hope you two can be happy together, but if it doesn't work out, don't blame Caroline."

"Mrs. Sharp, why are you saying this again? I promised you, and I will keep my word."

Royce seemed a bit helpless.

I didn't expect Kelly to be even more of a crybaby than me.

"Alright, alright, let's not talk about this anymore..."

I was trying to smooth things over, but Kelly suddenly stood up.

"Royce, if you really listened to what I said today, I'll believe you! But if you don't treat Caroline well in the future, don't come to our house again."

She covered her eyes and ran to the bathroom, tissues in hand.

I hadn't seen Kelly this emotional in a long time.

Royce had gone to take a phone call earlier, and I walked over to him, overhearing his conversation.

"I know, handle the company matters first."

"Emergency meeting, we'll discuss it when I get back..."

"Why haven't you found any information on what I asked you to investigate?"

Royce was more serious and cold when giving work instructions, a stark contrast to how he was with me.

With me, Royce was always gentle and considerate, never suddenly cold.

After a while, Royce seemed to notice I was close by and said a few more words to the person on the other end of the line.

"I'm at my girlfriend's house right now. We'll talk about the rest later."

Girlfriend?

That word made my face flush.

How could he introduce me as his girlfriend to others already?!

When Royce hung up and turned to look at me, I quickly pinched him. "What did you say to make my mom cry like that?"

Royce winced in pain. "Do you really want to know?"

"Of course!"

Kelly was crying so much. I hadn't seen her like this since I got home.

Royce sighed and looked at me. "Let's talk in your room. I don't want the kids to overhear."

I was about to say it didn't matter, but then I remembered Brett's curious nature and how he might come out asking questions...

Just thinking about the kids' mischievous expressions gave me a headache.

I sighed too and led Royce to my room.

Kelly had been taking care of my room lately.

Everything was just like before.

Last time, I had a sudden whim and told Kelly I wanted my room to look like it did when I was a kid, so she rearranged it.

It looked just like it did when I was in school, with a study area, a desk, and a computer.

The curtains and bedspread were pink with little flowers, and there were lots of stuffed animals on the bed.

It didn't look like a room for a woman nearing thirty at all.

As I led Royce in, I suddenly felt a bit embarrassed. "My mom's been taking care of my room lately, so it might look a bit childish..."

Royce walked in and looked around.

He picked up a teddy bear from the bed, squinting slightly. "Isn't this the one I gave you?"

His words made me freeze, and I walked over to look at the bear with him.

After a moment, memories came flooding back.

"It really is the one you gave me..."

That was back when we were in school together.

Even though everyone said we were close and would probably date, we never actually got together.

But there were little gestures that showed our closeness.

"You put this bear on my desk after class one day."

The memories came rushing back, and I couldn't help but think of the past.

Royce nodded. "I won this bear at a fair with some friends over the weekend."

"You won it? What game were you playing?"

"Just a simple shooting and ring toss game. I scored really high."

Thinking about how Royce was so good at school and also excelled at games made me laugh.

"I didn't expect you to win it from a game... but this bear is really well-made."

I squeezed the bear.

"I thought it was well-made and didn't look like a cheap toy, so I wanted to give it to you."

Royce explained everything.

He said that when he went out with friends, most of the little trinkets they saw weren't worth much and didn't seem meaningful.

But this bear seemed perfect for me, so he decided to give it to me as a gift.

But our relationship was a bit awkward and ambiguous at the time.

Neither of us could make the first move.

He didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so he slipped it onto my desk with a note.

[A gift for you. Take good care of it.]

It was so cold, it didn't even feel like a gift.

###chapter 296

I couldn't help but laugh and give him a playful pat on the shoulder. "Come on, that handwriting was totally yours. How could I not know it was from you?"

Royce's eyes locked onto mine, and I could tell something was up.

"What's going on?"

I thought maybe something had happened.

Royce's lips moved like he wanted to say something, but he didn't. Instead, he just pulled me into a hug.

His embrace felt so familiar and comforting, and his cologne surrounded me.

I whispered, "Isn't this the cologne I gave you?"

"Yeah, I've been using it ever since you gave it to me. I figured you liked the scent."

I nodded. "You guessed right. I do like it."

We held each other tightly, not saying a word for a while. That little memory we talked about was just a tiny part of our long history, but it made us feel so nostalgic.

I suddenly remembered what I had said to Kathy earlier. My voice trembled a bit as I spoke. "Why didn't you tell me how you felt back then?"

"If you had told me sooner, maybe we wouldn't have gone through all this..."

I still regretted it deeply.

Tears started to fall.

Royce's shirt collar got wet, and he shuddered, sensing my emotions. He quickly held my shoulders and pushed me back a little to look at my tear-streaked face.

"Hey, don't cry. Why are you crying all of a sudden?"

Royce looked at me, puzzled, but his eyes were still gentle.

Through my tears, I moved closer to him. "Royce, since you're here today, there's something I need to tell you."

"Go ahead..."

Royce held my hand and sat down on the edge of the bed.

"Even though today was just a visit, and sitting on your bed might not be appropriate, since you have something to say, I'll sit down."

I wiped my tears and took a moment to compose myself.

"Actually, when we had our falling out, I talked to my mom about it. I told you most of it, but there's one thing I never mentioned-about the kids."

I thought for a moment. "I'm not just talking about my four kids. If I agree to be with you, we'll eventually talk about marriage. But with my current situation, I already have four kids, and I don't think I'll have any more..."

"You're an amazing guy. If you want to get married, there are plenty of people who would be willing. So, are you really okay with being with me, even if we don't have kids of our own?"

It took all my courage to ask this.

If Royce showed even a hint of hesitation, I might not continue the conversation.

But he looked at me with such seriousness and determination, answering almost without hesitation, "I don't care about that now."

"I know what you're thinking-just because I don't care now doesn't mean I won't in the future. But you know what kind of person I am. I only think about the present. Right now, I want to be with you, and that's been my regret and obsession for so many years. Now that I finally have the chance to be with you again, how could I let it slip away..."

Royce cupped my face gently.

"And to be honest, Caroline, if we're talking about kids, I do hope we could have one together someday."

Royce had always been sincere about this.

I nodded. "I'm just worried we might have disagreements about this in the future..."

Royce held my hand firmly.

"No, listen to me."

I took a deep breath and looked at him seriously.

"Having three kids must have been really tough for you. I know you've been through a lot. All these years, I haven't gotten married because I thought if you and Brandon were happy together, it wouldn't matter if I stayed single forever. I've already considered that, so whether we have kids or not doesn't matter."

I hadn't expected him to think about these things.

"You've been keeping an eye on me?"

Otherwise, how would he know I was with someone else and had kids?

Royce nodded. "You might not know, but I've always been keeping track of how you're doing. Especially after I came back to the country."

Thinking about all he had done for me in silence made my heart ache.

"But if we're together, we'll eventually talk about this..."

"It's okay, Caroline. If you really don't want kids, we can write an agreement and settle it before marriage."

Royce wiped my tears again.

"Why are you crying so much now? I can't keep up with wiping your tears."

I turned my face away, embarrassed.

Maybe it's because I've seen too much lately.

Whether it was Joanna or Brandon, these things weighed on my mind.

Maybe I'm just a fragile person, and dealing with everything recently has been my limit.

"What I'm saying is, don't cry. As long as we're together, we can solve everything. Don't overthink it."

Royce hugged me and swayed gently. "Caroline, I won't say anything too sweet. I just know that as long as we're together, I can overlook everything else."

All my worries gradually faded away with his comfort.

Royce was really good to me.

Even after our embrace and kiss, when the atmosphere should have turned romantic, he held back his thoughts to talk to me about this.

And even after I said I didn't want more kids, he responded with such determination and acceptance.

"One more thing... If we do end up together, you don't have to worry about me having issues with your kids. I'll treat them as my own."

"Just like you do with Aria."

Aria wasn't my biological child, but I had raised him as my own. Royce said this to reassure me.

I nodded. "Got it... Then I'll give you a one-month trial period to become my boyfriend."

It seemed like my sudden mention of this caught Royce off guard.

He looked at me for a while before excitedly kissing my cheek. "Okay, thank you, Caroline."

"What's there to thank me for..."

I felt a bit embarrassed, touching my nose and whispering, "You're welcome."

###chapter 297

Finally, it was Zola who suggested we go out for dinner, and only then did Royce and I reluctantly leave the room. Just sitting together and chatting felt incredibly precious to me.

I realized that I still had feelings for Royce. These feelings were even stronger than what I felt when I married Brandon.

The next morning, as soon as I woke up, Royce called.

"Hey, how'd you sleep last night?" he asked.

"Pretty well," I replied softly.

It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my chest, and I was happier than I had been in a long time. Plus, Royce's trial period was down to just one month. If everything went smoothly, we would officially be a couple in a month.

As I was thinking about this, I heard Royce say, "I didn't sleep well at all last night."

"Why not? Did you have to work late after you got home?" I couldn't help but complain. "I told you not to visit when you're so busy, but you insisted. Now I feel guilty knowing how busy you are..."

Royce's voice was gentle on the other end of the line. "Caroline, I didn't sleep because I was too busy. I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about how, in a month, I could officially be your boyfriend."

My mind went blank. I wasn't sure if I was embarrassed or nervous, but I definitely felt a sweet happiness in my heart. This happiness was different from before; it was a certain kind of sweetness.

"Isn't that a bit exaggerated?" I said softly.

"Not at all. I'm really looking forward to it," Royce replied.

We chatted for a bit longer before I urged him to get some rest since he had work later. Just as I hung up, Simon called.

He didn't say much, just asked if I was free to meet up in the morning because he had a lot of news to share. I quickly agreed, and we arranged to meet at a café near my place in half an hour.

When I walked into the café, I immediately spotted Simon sitting in a corner. He looked much more disheveled than he had a few days ago, with stubble covering his face. I was shocked to see him like this; it was hard to believe this was the same confident Simon.

"What happened to you?" I asked as I sat down across from him. "Did you run into trouble during your investigation? Why didn't you tell us?"

Simon seemed lost in thought and only looked up after a moment. "What did you say?"

"I asked why you look so rough. What happened over the past few days?"

Simon finally understood what I was asking and shook his head. "It's just a disguise. I haven't shaved for three days on purpose."

I realized, "Is this for your investigation? Did you do this on purpose?"

"You guessed right," Simon smiled. "I wanted to stay under the radar during my investigation. I've been around you guys a lot lately, and if I showed up looking like myself, they would definitely notice."

Simon was indeed a professional private investigator, and I didn't need to worry about his methods. He then got to the point of why he wanted to meet.

"I called you here today because of Adelaide, the woman we met when we were looking for the child. She's in trouble."

Adelaide? With everything that had happened recently, I had almost forgotten about her, but memories of her interactions with the child came flooding back.

"What happened?" I asked urgently.

I knew that after the child was brought back, Adelaide had been settled nearby. Simon had been handling most of it, and I hadn't followed up. With everything going on with Ronnie and the project, I hadn't had time to think about Adelaide.

I had assumed that since the child was back, there wouldn't be any major issues. But now I was nervous. "What happened? Tell me."

"Don't worry, it doesn't affect us directly yet," Simon said, glancing around. "But you need to calm down, or people might notice."

The café was scattered with customers, and I realized I was getting too worked up. I took a deep breath. "Okay, tell me."

"Adelaide was taken from her house. If you want to go check it out, I can go with you," Simon said. "She didn't leave any clues, and we can't involve the police."

"Why can't we call the police?" I asked, feeling a surge of anxiety.

"Because when we found the child and brought him back, we did it privately. And the police were already helping us with the Brandon case..."

I understood. This situation was tricky for all of us, and we had already been to the police station countless times.

"As a private investigator, I'll handle this according to our plan. So, do you want to go check it out?" Simon asked.

I initially wanted to refuse, not wanting to get involved with anything related to Adelaide. But the thought of her being taken made my skin crawl. After a long pause, I said, "I have some time now. Do you have anything else to do today? Let's go check it out."

Simon nodded.

As we were about to leave the café, Savannah called. "Caroline, where are you?"

I had sent Savannah on a business trip a few days ago, and she must have just returned. "Did you just get back?"

"Yeah, I got back last night. I was so tired I fell asleep right away. I thought I'd call you this morning," Savannah said.

"Perfect timing. We have something to do. Come with us," I said.

Savannah quickly agreed. We arranged a meeting spot, and half an hour later, I picked her up.

She hugged me as soon as she saw me. "I missed you so much!"

Then she noticed Simon and greeted him. "Hey, Mr. Lawson."

Simon shook his head. "Just call me Simon. No need to be so formal."

Savannah stuck out her tongue playfully. "I have a lot of respect for you."

###chapter 298

The three of us finally headed to the house where Adelaide had been staying.

Honestly, Simon had handled most of this, and I was barely involved.

So, this address felt unfamiliar to me.

Thinking back, apart from the day we brought the kid back, I hadn't really been to this place.

Simon led us through the area.

Since the location was chosen to be discreet, it was in a rundown part of town.

The environment was cramped and dimly lit. If it weren't for Simon, Savannah and I would never have come to a place like this.

When we arrived at the house where Adelaide had been staying, Simon opened the door.

"I talked to the landlord. He said he hasn't seen her for a week..."

"The house has been really quiet, and when I came in, it was spotless."

This was clearly unusual.

If Adelaide had been taken away suddenly, she wouldn't have had time to clean the house so thoroughly. This could only mean that Adelaide had secretly contacted someone!

The thought made me anxious. "We were too lax in monitoring her..."

"Otherwise, how could she have had the chance to escape!"

Simon nodded and said, "If we get another chance, we'll definitely improve. But talking about it now won't help."

"Let's search the room for any clues and then head back."

Adelaide had been taken away, and she wouldn't be coming back anytime soon.

Simon's plan was to renew the lease for another three months.

If Adelaide didn't return by then, we'd give up the house and look for other ways to handle the situation.

"Keeping this place indefinitely isn't practical. And if we don't find any clues, it won't matter how long we keep it."

I knew Simon was right.

The three of us searched the house carefully, and I felt a sense of déjà vu, like when we were looking for the kid.

"Honestly, at this point, nothing surprises me anymore."

I sighed.

I accidentally knocked over a vase, and water spilled out.

The water was murky from sitting for days, and it splashed up dust when it hit the floor.

But as I stepped back, I noticed a small piece of paper floating in the water!

My heart raced, and I quickly bent down to pick it up.

The paper had no writing, just a drawing.

"Come take a look at this!"

I called Simon and Savannah over.

The two of them examined the drawing.

It looked like a flower, but none of us recognized it...

While they were trying to figure out what kind of flower it was, a face suddenly popped into my mind.

"Could this be a spider lily?"

Hearing my words, Simon was taken aback.

He quickly pulled out his phone and searched for the flower. "It does look similar..."

"What does she mean by leaving us this note?"

And the paper hadn't disintegrated despite being in the water for so long.

It was likely that Adelaide had hidden it there before being taken away!

"Good thing we came to check today, or we might have missed this clue."

I felt a chill run down my spine and pulled Savannah towards the door.

"Let's not stay here any longer. We need to figure out our next steps."

On the way back, I leaned against the car window, lost in thought.

The person with the spider lily avatar-I first saw her picture on Brandon's phone.

From that first glance, I had a gut feeling it was a woman.

Not just because of the avatar, but also because of the way she and Brandon communicated.

Thinking about those explicit messages still made me feel sick.

But now, knowing that the person with the spider lily avatar was still around, I felt an eerie sense of unease.

"If this really is about the spider lily, could it be connected to Brandon being released?"

Even though we had taken down half of the Jordan family, their foundation remained.

Especially with Brandon recently being released and acting so brazenly, he didn't seem worried about any retaliation from me...

"Honestly, if it is this person, she could very well be behind all of this."

Simon had already done some research. "My private investigator couldn't find any leads on this person."

"Some people like to use distinctive avatars like the spider lily, but it's hard to track someone down based on that alone."

Savannah nodded. "And they could always change their avatar."

I disagreed.

"If she was bold enough to use that avatar while exchanging explicit messages with Brandon, she wouldn't change it easily. And with Brandon being so arrogant after his release... I have a feeling the person using the spider lily avatar isn't afraid of being discovered."

It almost felt like she was turning herself into a symbol.

Simon started to ponder.

I shook my head, indicating I didn't know.

The only thing I knew for sure was that the person using the spider lily avatar had never really left my life.

Even when I thought everything was over, for them, it seemed like it was just beginning!

That's why Brandon was always used as a pawn, caught and released by them.

"If that's the case, I'll keep looking for clues about this person. But without more information, it's hard to pinpoint who she is."

I understood. "Time has flown by, and I almost forgot about this person."

Honestly, Brandon's disgusting actions were far more than just this.

Compared to the videos and other things he left behind, this was nothing.

It was just verbal provocation.

Thinking about Brandon again soured my mood. "Let's call it a day. When we get back, I'll also beef up security at home."

"Starting tomorrow, I need to get back to the office to handle the Asher project. You guys should focus on your own tasks."

Kathy had a private fitting session tonight, and I was swamped.

Simon nodded and dropped Savannah and me off at Kathy's studio.

Kathy's eyes lit up when she saw Savannah. "Perfect timing! One of my models canceled, and I was worried about finding a replacement. You're just in time..."

Savannah sighed. "I just got back. Can't I get a break?"

Kathy laughed. "It's a special time, so we all have to pitch in a little more!"

###chapter 299

Kathy was chatting with us, going over the plans for the venue and the models.

Savannah hesitated but mentioned she wasn't thrilled with her figure and thought wearing Kathy's designs might be tough.

Kathy waved it off with a smile. "No worries, as long as we have a model..."

"And my designs always flatter the figure, so don't stress."

I trusted Kathy and gave Savannah's hand a reassuring pat. "Don't worry, Kathy's a top-notch designer. Everyone raves about her clothes. You'll look amazing."

Savannah, thinking about Kathy's past work, finally relaxed. "I never thought I'd get to be a model at my age."

"Don't say that! If you're old, what does that make me?" I joked, pretending to be offended.

If Savannah thought she was old, then what about me?

"Why are we even talking about age? None of you are old! Come on, everyone, be my models!" Kathy laughed, trying to lighten the mood.

I noticed Kathy was dressed especially elegantly today. She wore a silver mermaid dress that shimmered beautifully, highlighting her beauty.

I couldn't help but gasp. "Kathy, you look stunning."

"This is a dress I made for myself. I know my body and measurements best, so of course, it fits perfectly." Kathy said confidently, twirling around and winking at us.

Seeing her confidence, I felt a sense of admiration.

"But don't just stand there, help me organize things..." As we busily helped Kathy prepare for the private custom event, my phone suddenly rang.

I picked it up and saw it was Joanna calling.

"Hey, Caroline, where are you guys?" Joanna's voice was calm, not showing any urgency.

"We're still at Kathy's studio, planning to head to the venue soon. What about you?"

Hearing Joanna's voice made me a bit anxious, as I couldn't help but think about her and Ronnie.

"I'm already at the hotel. I noticed you weren't here, so I called to check."

Joanna mentioned she had tried calling Kathy but couldn't reach her.

I was surprised but quickly explained, "She's been really busy, running around the venue..."

"But we'll be there soon. Just hang tight."

Joanna agreed and hung up.

I didn't hear anything unusual from her end, so I felt relieved. Just then, Kathy said, "I think we're ready. Let's get going."

There was still an hour before the event officially started.

During this time, we arrived and began organizing the models' outfits.

It was my first time helping Kathy with such an event, and I was understandably nervous.

Kathy noticed my anxiety and encouraged me, "You're a great speaker. Remember how amazing you were when you ran your own company?"

"There's no need to be so nervous."

I smiled and shook my head. "I'm not scared... just feeling a bit out of place."

"Maybe it's because I haven't been in a setting like this with so many people for a long time."

The last time I had such an experience was at a bidding event. But back then, I was too busy dealing with competitors to feel nervous.

Thinking about it made me a bit emotional. Those days felt like a distant memory now.

Kathy patted my shoulder. "By the way, didn't Joanna call and say she was already at the venue? Why haven't I seen her?"

"She said she was..."

I stopped mid-sentence, realizing something was off.

Joanna had said she was waiting for us at the venue, but now that we were here, where was she?

Kathy and I exchanged glances.

"I'll go look for her. Maybe she's still outside."

With that, I hurried outside.

We had entered through a side door to keep the models' outfits hidden. Maybe Joanna was waiting at the main entrance.

I called Joanna while searching for her.

I had thrown on a coat to cover my dress temporarily.

The phone rang a few times before she picked up.

"Joanna, where are you? We were supposed to meet here."

I looked around but still didn't see her.

Joanna sounded surprised. "You guys are here already? I just went to get ice cream with Ronnie. We're at the hotel entrance."

Ice cream...

I repeated the word, feeling a bit absurd.

But what really made my skin crawl was that she mentioned Ronnie.

I quickly made my way to the hotel entrance and saw Joanna.

Ronnie stood beside her, dressed in a suit, his hair meticulously styled, exuding a mature and composed aura.

Seeing him, I didn't know how to react.

Thinking about his past with Maeve made me feel disgusted and scared.

"Are you here for the private custom event too?"

After what happened with Maeve, I couldn't help but see Ronnie as tainted.

Unfortunately, I couldn't just have him checked out to confirm my suspicions.

Joanna smiled when she saw me. "I didn't see you at the main entrance and thought you hadn't arrived."

"We used the side door to protect the models' outfits, so it's normal you didn't see us."

I hurriedly explained, pulling Joanna towards the venue.

She said something to Ronnie before stumbling as I tugged her along. "Caroline, what's wrong?"

"Why are you acting so strange today?"

I whispered, "It's nothing... just that the event is about to start, and it's not good to be outside."

Joanna frowned.

She was always perceptive, and I knew she sensed something was off.

Sure enough, after a few steps, Joanna stopped and held my hand. "Caroline, don't rush."

"The event won't start for a while."

She stopped, her gaze steady and thoughtful.

###chapter 300

Joanna stopped dead in her tracks, clearly ready to have a serious talk with me.

I turned my head reluctantly to look at her.

Joanna met my gaze, looking more puzzled as she stood there, staring at me.

"Caroline, be straight with me. Ever since you saw Ronnie, you've been acting weird. Did something happen between you two?"

Joanna wasn't suspecting anything specific between Ronnie and me, but she had a gut feeling something was off.

She was sharp like that.

I sighed.

At this point, there was no way I could keep it from her any longer.

If I hadn't seen Ronnie earlier, I might have been able to pretend nothing had happened, but now...

The moment I saw him today, I knew that the fear and anxiety we had been suppressing were about to explode!

I took a deep breath. "Joanna, there's something I need to tell you."

Maybe my expression was too serious and intimidating, because Joanna waved her hand at me and tossed her ice cream cone into the trash.

She then walked over in her high heels and said, "Go ahead. Honestly, I've found it strange that you guys have been wanting to meet with me lately."

I gave a bitter smile. "You've always been very smart and perceptive. I never intended to keep this from you for so long."

But after saying that, silence suddenly spread between us.

Joanna seemed to be waiting for my response, blinking occasionally.

But she didn't push me to speak.

I stared at Joanna for a while, still unable to say anything.

Although seeing Ronnie made me feel that the whole situation was too complicated and I did want to tell Joanna the truth as soon as possible, now that I was alone with her, I didn't know how to start...

Just then, Kathy poked her head out and called us, "What are you two doing at the door? Come on in!"

Kathy's words interrupted the standoff between Joanna and me.

Joanna blinked, seemingly compromising, and said, "Let's go."

"If you have something important to say, we can talk later."

Without a doubt, Joanna prioritized the importance of the custom event over what I was about to say.

This gave me some time to collect my thoughts, and I nodded. "Let's go."

As soon as we returned to the event, I pulled Kathy aside and told her I had something on my mind, then grabbed Savannah.

"What's wrong?"

Savannah, suddenly pulled aside, was confused, thinking I was worried about hosting the custom event today.

She quickly came over to comfort me. "Don't worry, you're always great at handling these events. You're not only beautiful but also articulate. Kathy chose you for a reason..."

"It's not that."

I quickly explained what I had seen earlier at the event entrance, with Ronnie dropping Joanna off.

Savannah was stunned for a while.

It seemed like the news I shared had left her dazed and unsure of what to do.

I shook her hand. "I just told you something serious, and you have no reaction?"

After a long pause, Savannah finally spoke. "When I was away on business, you guys kept mentioning this, but I didn't realize it was this serious. Now that I'm back and hearing it from you, I'm suddenly scared..."

"Are Joanna and Ronnie really at this point?"

I nodded. "Yeah, it's serious. Did you think we were joking? Kathy and I have been stressed out, not knowing how to tell Joanna! Seeing Ronnie today, all my suppressed anger just flared up! If I hadn't seen him, I might have been able to hold back my emotions. But now, I really have to tell her. I'm just trying to figure out how to start..."

Some things are easier to think about than to actually do.

I'm stuck in a difficult position right now.

"Another reason is that when we met before, Joanna told us that her relationship with Ronnie wasn't good. They've been through a lot recently, and they haven't communicated much, especially in that aspect."

I lowered my voice, afraid someone might overhear.

"But seeing Ronnie drop her off today set off alarm bells in my head!"

Savannah swallowed. "I think I get what you mean. Are you worried that these small gestures might sway Joanna, and if they reconcile, then some things will definitely..."

"It's not exactly reconciling. They haven't broken up or fought. It's just that Joanna has been thinking about divorce."

As I spoke, an idea struck me.

Since Joanna was already considering divorce, maybe we could gently suggest it to her, and if she picks up on our hint, we could take it further?

Just as I was about to speak, I heard the sound of a cup hitting the floor behind me.

The noise startled me, and I turned to see Joanna standing right behind me.

Had she overheard my conversation with Savannah?

I hesitated, looking at Joanna, and saw that she seemed dazed, staring at me and Savannah.

Noticing my gaze, Joanna's expression changed. She instinctively started to walk away.

Realizing she must have heard us, Savannah and I quickly chased after her and finally caught up with her in the hallway.

"Joanna, where are you going?"

Joanna turned to look at me, then shook her head, as if she didn't know where to go.

Savannah and I sighed. "Joanna, if you heard what we were saying, do you have any questions?"

Joanna was a smart person, something I had been thinking about all day.

So I didn't think she would choose to ignore this.

She would ask me if she sensed something was off!

Just like she did at the entrance earlier.

Joanna stood there, staring at her shoes.

She was dressed beautifully and elegantly today.

Kathy had specially ordered a white dress for her, adorned with golden wheat decorations at the waist, making Joanna look stunning.

Looking at her radiant appearance, I thought about what I was going to say next...

Finally, Joanna made up her mind. "I did hear what you were saying. So, what you wanted to tell me is about Ronnie."

###chapter 301

Savannah frowned. "You two should talk in the lounge. I'll keep an eye on the door."

He clearly had no clue how to handle the situation, so he was just trying to help us out.

I nodded, pulling Joanna towards the lounge, and quickly turned back to inform Kathy.

Kathy was swamped with work and couldn't leave. She gave me a long look after hearing my decision. "You've been working hard too."

"Just so you know, when the private event starts, you'll have to manage it on your own. I probably won't be available."

I felt a bit guilty about this.

Our focus today was supposed to be on the private event.

But now, seeing Joanna, I was in a rush to resolve this issue.

Kathy smiled. "Don't worry about it. I even got two extra assistants to help me today. The event won't be a mess."

"Go talk to Joanna. I can't help you right now, but I believe you can convince her."

I gave a bitter smile and headed towards the lounge.

What could I possibly say to convince her?

My own marriage had been a disaster.

I didn't catch any diseases, and things are mostly resolved now, but that doesn't mean I didn't suffer and struggle!

No, my situation isn't even fully resolved...

That person, Manjusha, is still around.

I shook my head.

When I first realized Brandon wanted to kill me, I was in complete disbelief.

In my eyes, our relationship had always been great, and everyone saw me as the perfect woman. How could something like this happen to me?

Thinking about it, I realized Joanna and I were quite similar in some ways.

We had similar upbringings, and she was even more privileged than I was.

She excelled in school, had a great job, got married quickly, and started her own family.

People like us find it harder to accept major upheavals in our lives.

Lost in thought, I finally reached the lounge door. Savannah saw me and quickly blinked at me, indicating Joanna was still inside waiting. "Caroline, you go ahead and talk to her."

"If anything happens, just call me."

I said, "You stay here and keep watch. If anything changes, I'll call you."

A hotel isn't the safest place, and talking in the lounge was our best option.

Savannah nodded, looking at me with concern.

I opened the lounge door and saw Joanna sitting there, staring at a cup of water.

When she saw me, she stood up and placed the cup on the table.

She seemed ready for whatever I had to say and walked towards me.

She took my hand and said seriously, "I'm sorry, Caroline. I was a bit emotional earlier because I had a feeling... Now I'm calm. Tell me everything from the beginning."

In that moment, I felt a pang of sympathy for Joanna. Who knows what she had been thinking while I was gone.

I nodded and led her to the couch. "Let me explain what happened..."

I took a deep breath and recounted the day I saw Maeve and Ronnie together.

Joanna was stunned, staring at me with trembling lips. "Is what you're saying true?"

I nodded and quickly explained, "Yes, and I wanted to tell you that day!"

Joanna's eyes widened, her voice hollow. "Why didn't you tell me then?"

"Maeve stopped me. She said it was a one-time thing with Ronnie and didn't want you to divorce him because it would ruin her plans. I thought about it and discussed it with Royce. We didn't know how to tell you..."

Joanna listened intently.

"Given your unique marriage situation and your father's status, I felt telling you abruptly might cause a scene. So, I was waiting for the right time."

Joanna smiled at my frantic explanation, but it was a pained smile. She said, "You don't need to explain so much. You didn't tell me right away for my own good. Are there any other details?"

"You've been trying to reach me several times. I always felt you had something to say."

Seeing Joanna so calm, I quickly told her everything I had planned to say, including the secret tests we had done for her.

Joanna gasped and covered her face. Her shoulders started shaking as if she was crying.

Seeing her sudden emotion, I sighed and gently patted her back, trying to comfort her. I knew this was hard for anyone, especially for Joanna, who thought her marriage was improving.

After a while, Joanna spoke, her voice trembling. "Caroline, he came to pick me up today..."

Her voice was filled with suppressed pain, like she had endured all the suffering. "He said his company wasn't busy. I thought our relationship was finally improving, but it turns out he was just feeling guilty and trying to make up for it..."

Hearing this, I instantly understood Ronnie's motives. The saying goes, "No one does something for nothing." After his affair, Maeve might be busy again, and Ronnie was probably trying to fix his relationship with Joanna.

Thinking about it, I felt even more disgusted with these men. I said to Joanna, "We didn't tell you earlier because we didn't know how..."

"Seeing you two together today, I couldn't hold it in any longer."

"Don't blame us for not telling you sooner. It was my fault for delaying. They wanted to tell you earlier."

At this point, my voice started to tremble, and I was on the verge of tears. "Joanna, I'm telling you this because... it's for your own good!"

###chapter 302

Joanna hugged me tightly.

"No need to say more, I know we're good friends."

"I really hope you find happiness. Now that Ronnie's done this, we'll help you figure out how to get out of it, just like you helped me back then. But I just want you to stay strong..."

I don't even remember how I walked out of the lounge.

All I know is that when Joanna pulled me, she said, "I already know. You should go now, I need some time alone."

From her voice, I could tell she was on the verge of breaking down. I knew staying there wouldn't help.

When I told her the harsh truth, she needed time to process it.

At the lounge door, I felt utterly exhausted, rubbing my temples as I leaned against the wall.

Savannah quickly supported me, glancing cautiously at the door.

"How did it go? Did you tell her everything?" she asked.

I nodded. "Yeah, I told her everything. She needs some time to process."

Savannah was stunned.

"I was so anxious waiting outside. It felt like only ten minutes from start to finish, and you already talked it all out."

Savannah seemed incredulous.

Ten minutes...

I was surprised too, but I felt so drained, leaning against her for support.

I never imagined telling Joanna the whole truth would be this hard.

"Yeah, it only takes ten minutes to explain something, but we wasted so much time before..."

I couldn't help but cry as I spoke.

At that moment, Savannah and I heard muffled sobs from the lounge.

Joanna must be feeling so devastated.

I couldn't fully understand her feelings, but I remembered the pain when I found out Brandon wanted to hurt me...

I shivered.

I felt like the bad guy today.

Savannah patted my hand.

"Actually, while you were talking, I got a message from Simon."

"He tried to reach you but you didn't respond, so he asked me to pass it on."

Her words distracted me. "Any new developments?"

Savannah showed me the messages.

Simon said Maeve had left Suncrest City recently, apparently busy with something else.

[I'm telling you this so you can be at ease for now. I'll look into what she's up to.]

Reading the message, I felt a bit uneasy.

"So that's why Ronnie was suddenly so attentive to Joanna today..."

Maeve really wasn't in Suncrest City!

Thinking about it made me angry. "I feel relieved after telling her, but I regret not saying it sooner!"

"Don't dwell on it, Caroline. Things are what they are now."

Savannah tried to comfort me.

"We can't do much else but be there for Joanna and help her through this."

I felt exhausted.

Talking about it left me feeling overwhelmed.

Just as I was about to say something, we heard footsteps.

Savannah and I looked up to see Royce walking towards us in a sharp suit.

His deep eyes looked straight at me.

The tailored suit fit him perfectly, like it was made just for him.

Seeing him, I felt a surge of emotion. "Royce..."

I realized my voice was still shaky and tearful.

Royce's expression softened, his eyes full of concern.

Savannah quickly said, "I'll go help Kathy..."

Royce nodded. "Thanks."

"No problem. It's what I should do."

She gave me a worried look.

"Don't overthink it. Let's focus on work for now."

As Savannah left, I stared at Royce.

My pent-up emotions found an outlet.

"Royce, did you come just for me?"

"I heard from Kathy that you were planning to tell Joanna about Ronnie's affair."

Royce briefly explained, then pulled me into his arms.

In his warm embrace, I took a deep breath.

His hold was strong and comforting, his hand gently patting my back.

Tears blurred my vision. "I didn't expect it to be this hard to tell her..."

"Seeing Joanna's face, I thought she was going to break down. But I couldn't take back my words..."

He gently patted my back, his other hand soothing my head. "I know, I know."

Royce comforted me sincerely.

"I know it's hard for her to accept."

Royce said our experiences were different. When I found out about Brandon's betrayal, I discovered it myself and had time to prepare.

But Joanna was different.

From start to finish, we found out everything, and now we were just informing her.

As we talked, the lounge door opened.

Joanna, with tear-streaked cheeks, said firmly, "I'm going home to handle some things."

"I can't attend the custom meeting, please let Kathy know."

I wanted to persuade Joanna to stay and distract herself, but seeing her determined expression, I knew she had important things to do. She must have thought a lot in that short time.

I nodded and hugged her.

"Joanna, I know you're hurting and have a lot to do... But remember, don't act on impulse. Especially with Ronnie, gather evidence to protect yourself in the divorce."

Joanna nodded. "I know."

Her eyes, though washed with tears, were bright.

"Thank you for telling me. Otherwise, I'd still be in the dark."

Joanna said a few more words, glanced at Royce and me, then said, "I'm heading back. You guys take care."
