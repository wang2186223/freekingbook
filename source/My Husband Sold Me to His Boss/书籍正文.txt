### Chapter 1
"Sweetheart, please... just do this one thing for me. If you give in to Mr. Lowell, I'll finally get that Director promotion..."

Tears blurred my vision as I stood outside the hotel, wiping them away with trembling fingers. My husband's desperate plea echoed in my ears. Then, steeling myself, I walked toward that room.

What I didn't know—what I couldn't have known—was that Mr. Lowell wasn't alone.

Inside, several middle-aged men waited, all with thick necks and greedy eyes.

Because the "Mr. Lowell" my husband had mentioned wasn't just one man.

My stomach twisted. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't obey.

The juice Daniel had given me earlier… something was off.

My name is Emily Laurent. I've been married for just a year.

Life with Daniel had been perfect—until it wasn't.

For the past month, he'd been drowning under work pressure, obsessed with landing a promotion.

Tonight, he invited his boss, Richard Lowell, to our home for dinner—a last-ditch effort to secure his future.

I left work early, bought fresh ingredients, and cooked my best dishes—roast chicken, garlic mashed potatoes, glazed carrots—paired with two bottles of expensive Cabernet.

When Daniel arrived with Mr. Lowell, I forced a polite smile.

First impression? Greasy. Overweight. Balding. The kind of man who made your skin crawl.

No wonder Daniel joked privately that people called him "Fat Richard."

The moment he stepped inside, his beady eyes locked onto me.

"Emily, what a lovely wife you have," he said, gripping my hand too tightly, his thumb brushing my knuckles. "Beautiful and talented, I bet."

I yanked my hand back, mumbling an excuse to wash up in the kitchen. Only then could I steady my breathing before bringing out the rice.

Dinner was a performance. Mr. Lowell raved about my cooking while Daniel nudged me under the table—Keep drinking with him. Smile more.

I wasn't a drinker. One glass left me dizzy.

Daniel, though, downed most of the wine, laughing too loud, steering every conversation back to the promotion—only for Mr. Lowell to smirk and change the subject.

After dessert, they lounged on the sofa while I cleaned up.

Then—hands. Thick, clammy hands snaking around my waist from behind.

I spun around.

Not Daniel.

Mr. Lowell loomed over me, his breath reeking of wine.

"Mr. Lowell—you're drunk. Let me pass—"

He blocked the doorway, arms spread. "Emily... your husband's passed out cold. You do want that promotion for him, don't you?"

His grin widened as he reached out, his fingers grazing my cheek.



### Chapter 2


My body locked up for a heartbeat, my mind blank with shock.

But when Richard Lowell's fingers grazed toward me, my reflexes kicked in—I swatted his arm away and bolted from the kitchen like my life depended on it.

The living room revealed Daniel sprawled on the couch, snoring lightly like nothing was wrong.

Richard materialized in the doorway moments later, his expression sour. "Well, Emily," he said, adjusting his tie, "since you're... indisposed, we'll continue this conversation at the office tomorrow. About your husband's promotion, of course."

He paused at the door, flashing teeth that didn't reach his eyes. "Oh, and compliments to the chef. That pot roast was divine."

I managed a stiff nod, my goodbye wave trembling. The second the door clicked shut, I exhaled like I'd been punched.

Daniel groaned awake almost immediately. "Where's Richard?" he mumbled, rubbing his face.

My throat tightened. "Honey, that man—he's not who you think. His hands were all over—"

"Come on," Daniel scoffed, suddenly alert. "Every woman at the firm worships him. They have lunch dates, for Christ's sake."

The words shriveled in my mouth. I'd expected concern, maybe anger—not this blind defense.

Weeks passed with Daniel's promotion dangling like a carrot. Then came the confession over takeout: "It's Sophia Roland now," he admitted, pushing lo mein around his plate. "Rumor is she showed up at Richard's place with 'gifts' last night. Babe, if you just—"

"Absolutely not." My chopsticks clattered onto the table. That slimy smirk of Richard's haunted me.

Daniel caught my wrist. "This is our future. Double salary. Annual bonuses. Maybe even Bali?" His thumbs traced circles on my skin—the way he'd done during our courthouse wedding. "One dinner. One gift. That's all."

I should've held firm. But the bags under his eyes, the way his dress shirts hung looser these days...

"Fine," I whispered.

Two hours later, I stood shivering in the driveway—black miniskirt riding up, stockings snagging on my own doubts—wondering how delivering a bottle of Scotch turned into this.



### Chapter 3


My husband drove me to Mr. Lowell's apartment building, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. He thrust the carefully wrapped gifts into my hands. "You should go up alone," he said, avoiding my eyes.

The elevator ride felt endless. When I reached the penthouse, I barely had time to ring the bell before the door flew open—revealing Sophia Roland, our office manager, draped over Mr. Lowell like a human necklace, her lips planted on his neck.

My breath caught. For a heartbeat, I thought I'd interrupted a marital moment—until recognition hit. Sophia recovered first, flashing a Cheshire cat smile as she sauntered past me. Her blouse buttons were mismatched, and when our eyes met, hers burned with pure venom.

"Here about Daniel's promotion?" she purred, leaning close enough for me to smell her Chanel No. 5. "Good luck with that." Her mocking laughter trailed behind her like toxic perfume.

"Emily! What a surprise!" Mr. Lowell boomed, acting like we'd just bumped into each other at a coffee shop. The apartment was conspicuously empty—no wife, no kids, just an uncomfortable silence and my pounding heart.

I extended the gifts with both hands, my smile straining. His fingers lingered too long against mine, the contact making my skin crawl after what I'd just witnessed.

He poured water I didn't want. "Your husband's talented, no question," he began, circling like a shark. "But the board favors Sophia for this promotion..." His eyes dropped to my wedding ring. "Unless you're willing to... negotiate."

The implication hung between us, thick as cigar smoke. When I didn't respond, he waved at the untouched gifts. "Take these back. Meet me tomorrow at The Ritz-Carlton—Suite 808. Show up, and Daniel gets promoted the next morning." His smile turned wolfish. "Sleep on it."

Daniel's face darkened when he saw the rejected gifts. He slammed the steering wheel so hard the horn blared. "Goddammit! I knew Sophia would pull this shit!"

"You sent me in there knowing?" My voice cracked. "Were you offering me as bait?"

His anger crumpled. "Never! But Emily... this promotion..." His phone rang—his mother asking about the raise we'd promised would let us start a family. Watching him lie to her broke something in me.

That night, Daniel unraveled in our bed, painting dreams of me quitting my job, of nursery walls and college funds. His desperation wore me down until I whispered, "I'll go."

The next evening, he handed me juice outside The Ritz-Carlton. "For courage," he said, avoiding my eyes as the elevator doors closed between us.

Suite 808's door swung open to reveal Richard in a robe that barely covered his smug grin. But when I stepped inside, my blood turned to ice—five more men in identical robes stood waiting, their hungry smiles mirroring Richard's.



### Chapter 4

"Richard... Mr. Lowell, what are you doing?"

I recoiled instinctively, my pulse hammering in my throat. Every muscle screamed at me to run.

"Emily, didn't your husband Daniel tell you to come here and keep me company?"

"But—we share the same last name. We're both Mr. Lowell..."

Richard smirked, exchanging knowing glances with the slimy men behind him. Their grins made my skin crawl.

I turned to bolt, but my legs suddenly felt like lead. A cold dread washed over me—the juice Daniel had handed me earlier. Drugged.

I pressed a hand to my temple, shaking my head hard to fight the fog creeping in.

"Stay... stay away from me!" My voice came out ragged.

"One more step and I swear to God, I'm calling the police!"

I lurched toward the door, my vision swimming.

Fumbling with my purse, I made a desperate grab for the exit—but the handle wouldn't turn. Locked from the inside.

"Emily, where's the fire?" Richard's voice oozed false sympathy as he stepped into view.

"Didn't you promise Daniel you'd entertain me? Leaving so soon?"

His grin widened. "That's not happening, sweetheart."

The way his beady eyes roamed over me made my stomach twist.

"Don't—don't you dare touch me!"

My hands shook violently as I dug through my purse for my phone. "I mean it—I'll call the cops!"

The phone slipped from my fingers, clattering to the floor. My blood ran cold.

"Cut the act, Emily." Richard let out a low, ugly laugh.

"Your husband set this up. Is that spineless bastard really worth protecting?"

The truth hit me like a punch to the gut. Daniel's sudden promotion. His insistence I come tonight.

He'd sold me out for a damn title. The betrayal stole the breath from my lungs.

"Relax, honey." Richard took another step forward as my back hit the wall.

"Play nice tonight, and Daniel gets his promotion tomorrow. Everybody wins."

The other men closed in, their greedy eyes undressing me.

Then I remembered—the small fruit knife I'd slipped into my bag just in case.

My fingers closed around the cool metal. I whipped it out, my voice shaking but fierce.

"Back off! I swear to God, I'll use this!"


### Chapter 5

The moment I understood even a fruit knife couldn't level the playing field, I twisted it backward and pressed the cold steel against my own throat.

"Back off! One more step and I swear to God I'll slit my own throat right here!"

The blade bit into my skin as Richard Lowell and his goons froze mid-step. Their eyes darted between each other, faces tightening like they'd just bitten into something rotten.

Seconds stretched into eternity until the room started spinning. Then—bang!—the door exploded inward.

A statuesque woman in a razor-sharp blazer marched in like she owned the place. "You're done here," she announced, flicking her wrist like shooing flies.

The way Richard and his crew scrambled out would've been comical if my life wasn't hanging by a thread.

Only when the door clicked shut did my lungs remember how to breathe.

"Who...?" My voice came out ragged as I stared at this stranger. No recognition sparked—just a gnawing certainty I'd remember someone with that kind of presence.

"Olivia Macmillan. Mr. Roscente's right hand." Her manicured fingers adjusted her cufflinks. "Those men worked for him too. This whole charade? Just a test to show you who Daniel really is."

Her words hit like a sucker punch. Richard's earlier taunts came flooding back, twisting my gut. Had my husband been playing me this whole time?

Fragments of Daniel's behavior reassembled in my mind—the cold ambition, how easily he'd thrown me under the bus for that promotion. My vision tunneled as my ribs became a cage for something sharp and screaming.

Then—black.

Sunlight stabbed through the curtains when I woke in a king-size tangle of Egyptian cotton. I bolted upright, heart hammering at the unfamiliar bathrobe clinging to my skin.

"Morning, Ms. Laurent." Olivia materialized from a wingback chair. "You passed out last night—combination of whatever Daniel slipped in your juice and the shock. Had a doctor check you."

She nodded toward a discreet security camera. "Your clothes were changed by the head housekeeper. Footage is available if you need proof."

I touched my throat where the knife had pressed. No marks. Just this eerie, unwarranted calm.

"Thanks."

As I swung my legs over the bed, the name finally registered. "Wait—Olivia. This Roscente guy you work for..."

I searched my mental Rolodex. Nothing. "Do I know him?"

She handed me a stack of freshly pressed clothes. "Let's just say he knows you well enough to intervene." The fabric smelled like lavender and something more expensive. "He's keeping his distance to avoid complicating your life further."

I was buttoning my blouse when her casual afterthought turned my blood to ice:

"Oh, and the doctor found needle marks on your hip. You might want to get that checked."


### Chapter 6

Olivia's words hit me like a punch to the gut. My eyes widened in shock—this couldn't be real.

I hadn't gotten any shots recently, especially not in my hip. So why were there needle marks on my body?

"Though I'd suggest you don't mention this to your husband just yet," Olivia added before dismissing me with a nod. "Daniel's already waiting outside in the car."

The moment I stepped out of the hotel, Daniel sprang from the driver's seat, grinning like he'd won the lottery.

"Sweetheart, I'm so sorry about last night! Guess what? Richard just texted—I'm getting promoted to Director today!" He practically vibrated with excitement. "It's official!"

I clenched my jaw, fighting to keep my expression neutral.

"Hey… you okay?" His smile faltered as he studied my face. "You look wrecked. Aren't you happy for me?"

"Just tired. Didn't sleep well," I muttered, sliding into the passenger seat before he could press further.

He offered to drop me at work, but I faked a headache and begged off, claiming I'd called in sick. As we pulled up to our apartment, he squeezed my hand. "Rest up—tonight's the big celebration dinner with the team. Wear something nice, yeah?"

I nodded mechanically. The second his taillights vanished, I flagged a cab and sped to the hospital.

After explaining my situation to a specialist, we both braced for a worst-case scenario—some kind of virus or poison. But the test results were even more bizarre.

"Fertility treatments," the doctor confirmed.

My stomach dropped.

Daniel knew I didn't want kids yet—not for years. Between our mountain of debt and my health issues, we could barely keep our heads above water. A baby would drown us.

Then it clicked. Those weirdly deep sleeps after his "special weekend soups"...

A cold sweat prickled down my spine. The man I'd married—was he really capable of this?

What else was he hiding?

Folding the test results into my bag, I made a decision. No confrontations. Not yet.

First, I'd dig up the truth myself.



### Chapter 7

The celebration banquet that night called for my sleekest black evening gown. As Daniel Evans escorted me into the private room, his colleagues burst into applause. This was his moment in the spotlight—not mine. I pasted on my brightest smile and worked the room.

Richard Lowell, the balding executive, made for the most awkward encounter. Though Daniel had invited him, Richard wouldn't meet my eyes all evening, showering everyone with over-the-top politeness instead. I could practically see the terror still etched on his face from last night's encounter with Olivia Macmillan. Clearly, Alexander Roscente's invisible hand was at work behind the scenes.

But Alexander's motives were the least of my concerns tonight. I needed to uncover what secrets Daniel had been keeping from me. How could he betray me like this?

Midway through the champagne-fueled festivities, my phone buzzed with an anonymous text: Ladies' room, first stall on the right. The sender's name—Olivia—stopped my breath. I excused myself immediately, pretending I needed the bathroom. Daniel had vanished earlier, supposedly mingling with guests.

Holding my breath, I slipped into the designated stall. Before I could orient myself, Daniel's voice carried through the partition:

"Victoria, Emily gave up everything for my promotion. Just hang on a little longer. Once she delivers the baby, we can finally be together—you, me, and our child."

The words hit me like a gut punch. My entire world crumbled in that instant. Had Daniel secretly given me fertility shots? Was his plan to dump me after childbirth and start fresh with another woman? What the hell was I to him?

"I trust you, Danny. And congratulations again today," purred a feminine voice I knew all too well.

At first I refused to believe it. Then it hit me—my direct supervisor's full name was Victoria Evans. The puzzle pieces snapped together with brutal clarity.

I didn't make a sound. Just waited in silence before slipping out unnoticed.

Ten minutes later, Daniel emerged. Right behind him came Victoria Evans—my stunning, backstabbing boss. How did she even know my husband? She'd never once hinted at their connection during all our work interactions.

Timing it perfectly, I "accidentally" collided with her near the restroom entrance. "Victoria! What are the odds running into you here!"

The blood drained from her face when she saw me. For the first time ever, the unshakable Victoria Evans looked genuinely spooked.



### Chapter 8

She probably still thinks I'm completely in the dark about her little affair with my husband.

"Actually, I already have dinner plans with a friend. Maybe you should go ahead without me..."

Victoria Evans kept her voice steady, but I didn't miss the flicker of panic in her eyes.

Then my phone buzzed—another text from Olivia. One glance, and I knew exactly what to do.

"Victoria, what a coincidence! My husband's celebration dinner is happening here tonight. Since you've been such an amazing mentor at work, why don't you join us? It'll be the perfect chance for everyone to meet."

Before she could protest, I looped my arm through hers with practiced ease, steering her toward the private dining room. She stammered excuses, but I batted them away with effortless charm. She couldn't bolt without looking suspicious, so under my relentless cheerfulness, she had no choice but to follow.

"Daniel, look who I ran into! This is Victoria—the incredible supervisor I'm always telling you about!"

The second Daniel Evans laid eyes on her, he froze. Shock flashed across his face before he forced a polite smile.

"Sweetheart… have you two met before?"

Following Olivia's script, I asked the question with perfect innocence. Just then, Olivia herself slipped into the room, giving me a subtle nod.

The effect was instant. Both Daniel and Victoria stiffened, their reactions almost comically synchronized.

"Of course not!" they blurted out in unison.

I nearly laughed at how perfectly they'd walked into the trap—but I kept my expression flawlessly composed.

Right on cue, an elegant hostess stepped forward with a microphone. After congratulating Daniel on his promotion, she smiled sweetly and announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special presentation for you tonight."

The screen lit up—revealing security footage of Daniel and Victoria tangled in each other's arms just minutes earlier, their lips locked in a kiss that left no room for doubt.

The room exploded in gasps.



### Chapter 9 

"Wait a damn minute—you two know each other?" The guy next to me practically shouted, pointing between Daniel and Victoria Evans. "You both swore you'd never met!"

His accusation sent shockwaves through the room. Every head swiveled toward the pair, hungry for answers about Victoria's true identity.

"Kill the feed! Shut it down now!"

Daniel and Victoria erupted into panic. Daniel looked ready to vault onto the stage and smash the projector himself.

Too late. The screen lit up with their incriminating conversation from the women's restroom. As Daniel's own words boomed through the speakers, the crowd exploded.

The room went electric. Dozens of furious faces turned toward Daniel while others started hurling insults at Victoria.

"Daniel Evans—consider this your official termination for gross misconduct."

His CEO stormed in flanked by security, slamming the paperwork on the nearest table.

Then came the knockout punch.

"Victoria Evans—you're fired."

I nearly choked when our company chairman, William Richter himself, materialized to deliver the blow.

Daniel snapped. His face twisted into something unrecognizable as the realization hit him—this was my doing. He wheeled on me with murder in his eyes.

"Emily Laurent, I'll fucking kill you! This is all your—"

Olivia Macmillan moved like lightning. She had him face-down on the floor before he finished the sentence.

Chaos erupted as police swarmed in—someone must've called them earlier. They cuffed Daniel for corporate fraud and attempted murder.

The truth came out later: Victoria wasn't just Daniel's colleague. She was his ex-wife. Years of marriage, no kids—because Victoria couldn't conceive.

So they'd cooked up this sick plan: divorce, have Daniel marry some naive woman (me), knock her up, then ditch her to play happy family with Victoria.

The second Daniel got hauled away, I filed for divorce. The judge stamped those papers so fast they practically caught fire.

On my way out of the courthouse, Olivia pulled up in a sleek black car. "Mr. Roscente wants to see you."

My brain short-circuited when I recognized him—the impossibly handsome security guard from Daniel's company.

Alexander Roscente stepped forward in a tailored gray suit, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Let's try this again. Alexander Roscente."

My mouth fell open. "But you—the uniform—"

"Mr. Roscente does quarterly undercover work," Olivia explained, barely containing her grin. "Even as a security guard."

Heat flooded my cheeks. I'd pestered this man for help like he was some random employee. Yet he'd listened with endless patience—enough to remember me.

Turns out, after learning I was married, Alexander kept tabs on me. When he discovered Daniel's double life, he dug deeper. The more he uncovered, the more determined he became to expose the truth.

By the time he finished explaining, tears blurred my vision.
